{"text":"My last review was a novel, this will be short. Ordered online for pick up, food was handed to me at EXACTLY that time, not a minute later. Aaarrrmmmyyygaaawwwd amazing!  Why the 3? One order was wrong :( BUT it was pretty good anyway so I'll leave it be. We're all human after all."}
{"text":"The food there is really good. Service was not that great but not terrible either. They have 1,000,000 TVs for watching sports.  the place itself is really big great for big crowds."}
{"text":"The service here sucks.  We waited over 24 mins for food.  Our waitress was oblivious. Once she got our order we didn't see her again.  I finally had to flag someone down.  Then once we got our food she asked how everything was and then she was gone again.  I had to flag her down for boxes and check.  The food here is not worth the horrible service."}
{"text":"I sought out the new b-dubs in downtown Kent. Having never been to the new location I was impressed with the building and T.V set up and everything else. Very impressive however it ended there our waitress on a dead afternoon came by 4 times and really didn't talk the even ask us how the food was she would just grab our drinks with no heads up and bring them back. Really frustrating service. Very disappointed because with only 3 other tables being served on the floor by other ppl idk what in the hell could keep you from providing some decent service"}
{"text":"If you ever want to call this particular BWW for event information. Just look at your self in the mirror and say, \"f*ck off\" . That's equivalent to the type of answer you get from the people that work there."}
{"text":"Between the servers talking crap about patrons or the servers kids running around my table and honestly its about the homeliest staff ive ever seen i cant go back. The servers need to shut up and the person who hires needs to be fired"}
{"text":"It is so loud with music blaring and everyone talking. No prices in the drinks menu.  You have to wait for your bill? The wings had been pre cooked then heat up with sauce.  They were just warm.  The salad was wilted. This is our last time here. Food not very good and way to loud."}
{"text":"I have lunch at this location once a week. Although today I had the worst service i could imagine. Our server was LEESON, & he/she was the most awful server ever. After bringing us drinks he made us wait 25 minutes before taking our order (we had to call him over.) once my friend called him over he said \"girl don't get attitude with me.\"  Once ordering, my friend asked the difference between seasoning and sauce for her wings and he began to yell at her like she was stupid. Still, she still didn't get it, so he began to act like a smart ass and rolled his eyes. At that moment, the tip didn't even exist anymore. After our meal I tipped him but she didn't (her meal was 12$.) He/she later decided to come over to her face  saying \"Thank you for tipping me, I really appreciate it\" with a huge smile while walking away. After calling over the manager, he looked like he truly didn't give a shit about his disloyal employee. So sad to see this happen. Please beg to not have LEESON as your server."}
{"text":"Awful! I'm in town for work and wanted to watch my baseball game. It's Monday night so I understand it will be busy and Monday Night Football will be on so I find a spot at the bar and ask for my game. The bartender explains to me, since they \"went corporate\" they can't play baseball games. Uh, huh? Went corporate? You're a chain. That was odd to me so I ask a manager and he said they don't get the sports packages. Again, makes no sense, you're Buffalo Wild Wings...you have every game. Then another manager comes over and says they're having issues with their tv and can only get the MNF game and the Brewers game. No thanks, I'll go somewhere else.   Very disappointing. BWWs is always my go to place when traveling to watch whatever game I want. It's a great sports town so I assumed I would be fine. My game is on at Hooters so no more BWWs in Madison."}
{"text":"Went to this place twice in the past 10 days. My wife likes the wings a lot."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. I wish there was an option to give out negative stars. It took over 90 minutes for our food to arrive and that didn't include food for our entire table. We watched over 8 trays of food be delivered to other tables that had arrived after us. We asked multiple times to speak with the manager and we were ignored. Our server, Ashley, was amazing. She was the one positive thing during lunch that day although it was painful to watch her be ignored and yelled at by the manager because she asked him to come speak with our table. She tried numerous times to speed up our order without success. I was there for Mary Kay Career Conference and we missed part of the conference because of our choice to go to this restaurant. I expect better when I eat out. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Eh, drinks where overpriced and weren't that good. Service was fast for it being the lunch rush. The chicken wrap was good but needed more sauce and less lettuce. All around it was okay but not worth the price."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! For years I always order the buffalo chicken wrap. I have been going here for years with my boyfriend and by far one of my favorite places to go to! I would defiantly recommend going here!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I go here religiously every other Sunday. We love the atmosphere especially on game night. The wings are amazinggg! And I'm usually not big on fries but they have they are the best! Their food is always fresh. We've been going for 3 years now and haven't had any complaints thus far. The staff is always welcoming, they even give your kids a little tablet to keep them busy with games while you wait for your food. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"This review is for takeout. I'm a lover of BWW and this location is right by my work so me & my coworkers order out of here almost every week. Customer service is usually just okay, better when you actually go in, sit down and eat, especially in the bar. Today I placed 3 separate orders over the phone. When I arrived, they forgot part of the first order so I had to wait there for them to make it, in the middle of my work day. When I got back to work, we found I was shorted a ranch that I had paid for, and my coworker found that his wing order was short about 5 wings so we called in and spoke with a helpful manager, Daniel, who offered to remake the order.   My coworker went back to the BWW to pick up his order and, when he asked for the ranch that they had forgotten, they refused to give it to him because it wasn't on that receipt.  Lol  are you kidding me? He mentioned it was on a separate order and they really wouldn't give him one side of ranch valued under a dollar. At this point it became laughably bad to just about everyone in our office.   There are plenty of other BWW locations around the valley with awesome servers & hosts who treat customers as they should be treated, unlike this one. If you feel like wings but don't want to waste your time & money at this location, just go to the one on Durange since they're always great."}
{"text":"Great bar and good staff. Annie is always friendly. Food is very nice. Good for football or anytime."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for our food, and when we asked the bartender about it, he told us that he hadn't put  in the order yet. He put in the order then proceeded to disappear. We had been there so long that it must've been time for his break. Since he was no where to be found, we asked for a manger. The manager Jeff came out, and said he would inquir about our food. Not what I wanted as I knew at that point the food was coming out. And of course he didn't make the food come out any sooner, we still had to wait for it to come out. When the manager brought the food out, he gave us 2 tickets for free wings. When I voiced my dissatisment with this option, he offered another 2 free tickets. I accepted, however, he came back out twice after that, and we tried to get his attention, but he was actively ignoring us and avoiding eye contact. My boyfriend insisted we leave because he was tired of waiting around. This was hands down the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant, and that's saying something."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of BWW's.  I love traditional wings and I always like to switch it up with different sauces. Most of them are great medium, spicy garlic, Asian zing, honey BBQ,  I've even had them mix sauces.  You can't go wrong with Buffalo Wild Wings.  It's quick and easy to get to-go orders also."}
{"text":"Awesome! We love it here. Of course it can be loud, but that's what it is -- a sports bar. Food always good, service always great. We went on Saturday to celebrate a gold medal I'd gotten, and Hayley (server) and Tony (manager) gave us a free dessert, unsolicited, just for choosing to celebrate with them. That was really sweet. They are kind, attentive, and this place is very clean, for the traffic that runs through here on a daily basis. Never have had a bad experience. Justin is a great server, as is Hayley."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Bulls game the Manager was really nice and went above and beyond to make sure that we got to see our game..Server was really nice I believe her name was Amanda. .Will be back here when we visit Vegas again. ."}
{"text":"So our first trip the restaurant ran out of wings. No, that's not a typo...a wing restaurant ran out of WINGS! Our second trip we say down but never received service and it wasn't even busy so we left...unnoticed. Our third trip the restaurant was out of their featured sauce. 3 strikes, you're out BWW!"}
{"text":"Two words. Soggy. Wings.  Seriously every time we order, we ask for crispy wings and every time they give us these mushy, soggy excuses for wings. Seriously every time."}
{"text":"Had the Screamin' Nacho Burger and it was an instant hit. Combination of Tortilla Chips, Jalapeños, Pico De Gallo, Chipotle Sauce, and Pepper Jack cheese over a medium well burger all flow extremely well on the palette. Paired with an ice cold Coors Light and a side of potato wedges, this burger/meal has become my new favorite!"}
{"text":"They do not accommodate big parties. Tried to have my boyfriends little sister party of 8 there and they acted like it was the most DIFFICULT THING in thee WORLD together to put two tables together. We waited 40 minutes to watch the let all the smaller parties sit before us and only to be sat at two different booths. But before the waiter could take our drink orders we watched them  combine two tables together for a party of 10 that had just walked in and said they waited longer than us  lies. And you can't make reservations and the place is small as heck.... I think its because we were black and the other party wasn't. I don't know. But we ended up leaving. They werent going to get our money."}
{"text":"Poor service, dirty dining room. We were seated next to a dirty table which was never cleaned up the entire time we were there.  Someone that looked to be a manager walked by it at least 5 times and did nothing.  Floor was dirty as well.  Ordered a meal that did not contain gluten because of an allergy and asked the server to let the kitchen know that it is an allergy. After taking a few bites found a crouton buried in the lettuce and showed the server. Asked if they could remake it quickly and bring a to go box because we had to pick up kids. After about 10 minutes she brought a to go box and we asked where the salad was. Responded that she thought we just wanted the box, and they took the salad off of the bill.  ?????????"}
{"text":"First time at BWW! It was delicious! Great Parmesan Garlic and Medium hot wings! Also Fried pickles and jalapeño poppers! Definitely will be eating here more often! Great friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Been to BWW with the family about 10 times this year the service is either hit or miss depending on who waits on you. when you get the right service the experience can be enjoyable but get the wrong server and it could be a long night, manager seems like a moron also. The wings are great but I prefer smaller wings with all meat rather than those big wings full of fat that you get at other places.wings  Nachos are good and beer selection also good, my kids enjoy it. Good luck"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to dine. I love the food, and love the hospitality.  Our waiter tonight was probably one of the best I've ever had. (If you like dry humor) he's respectful yet down to earth. His name was Tom. If you get him, be prepared to have a good relaxing time."}
{"text":"Busy Friday night at BWW so I walk in with two of my friends. We get to the desk to talk to the hostess, her name tag reads \"Lil Bit\". So she took my name and number and informed us that it would be a 25-30 minute wait. I looked to the other two in my party to confirm if we wanted to stay or not and she looks right through us to the next people in line. It was 10 seconds max. Incredibly rude. Now I do love the food but was very put off by this young woman's attitude. I understand that it was a busy night but there's a difference between efficiently serving customers and hurrying people through without consideration. \"Lil Bit\" needs a courtesy lesson."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night so we figured we would have to wait a bit to be seated and served, we waited for 20 minutes before we sat down when there was only one large party in the the resturaunt, once sat we waited 45 minutes before we left, not even a drink order or interaction with a server, we finaly decided to walk out and never come back to this resturaunt again, rude waiters, understaffed, and a very unpleasant experience"}
{"text":"Ok whatever.. but way overpriced !! Me & my bud went for beer & wings while watching some football.. Walked out broke !! LOL !!"}
{"text":"The fist time I came in the food was pretty good (wings) and the servers were attractive, engaging and professional.  Acoustics here are horrid: your bartender needs to practically scream at you and vice versa - family fun??! The second time the food had slipped (worst cheese fries of my life) and the staff had lost some diversity and personality. Now we have the dregs and the crowd is seeming to follow.  This place probably has 3 months to escape the curse on this location or it's curtains - and I'm sorry to say I am a party to those who will draw the cord."}
{"text":"The only things I expect from chains like this are good service and consistent food. This Buffalo Wild Wings failed on both fronts.   Really poor service: There were no menus at the table, and we weren't given one-- I had to snag one from another table. Three different people came to our table to bring food and drinks out. When our food arrived, we didn't have silverware (necessary for salads), so I had to go ask the hostess. I walked past two managers while doing this, who were just chit-chatting and leaning on a counter. No refills on our water during the meal, and our waitress was impossible to flag down for the check.  The food was not up to par for this chain. The chicken in the wrap I had was not spun well in sauce, leaving it pretty dry. About half of the tortilla chips were crushed.   Really disappointing."}
{"text":"The chicken wings I have to say were HUGE! (it's obvious that these chickens worked out)   Good flavor on my wings and as well as my friends wings that they let me try. I would say \"Finger Licking Good\" but I really don't want the colonel after me....   I started this review some time ago but once you start getting Teriyaki sauce on your phone and you don't have those little wipey thingy's you just put the phone down and finish it later."}
{"text":"Nice food. Mainly chicken wings and some veggies on the side. Good ambience to watch some sports while you're enjoying the flash fried wings...."}
{"text":"I still don't know why I come here. Our server was nice but the food was horrible and you could tell she was worried about getting a bad tip but the food isn't made by her so I won't place blame on the service. The side salad $5 roughly, didn't even fill up the bowl, the fries nearly $4 were as well not even to the rim of the boat and as well cold! We had our server come take the fries away and off of our bill. Leaving with a stomach ache from bad oil :("}
{"text":"They want want to card us to get a beer, but they never had card me before.  She ask my husband  for I.D but not me. Really! The waitress never came to see if we were fine or we need anything after."}
{"text":"4/4/17 my server was Madeline, she was very nice and on top of my drinks throughout my meal. She was one of the most attentive servers I have had in a long time. The food was great and we were eating within 10 minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"I typically enjoy my vices to this location. The bee is cold and the wings are good. But today was terrible. I know that Sunday's are busy. And I know they are even busier when the cards play at home. But why on a day when the cards are at home would the servers spend so much time congregating at the hostess area.  All day there are 7 servers standing at the hostess area just talking. I am looking at the area right now and there are 10 servers standing there talking instead of working. This is a busy location. Get you crap together and get to work.  The manager is nonexistent. I even heard the servers taking negatively about him."}
{"text":"My third attempt at getting my charges corrected has gone unanswered. Now they have charged me even more. I sent an email to corporate but no response in 24 hrs."}
{"text":"Awful dinner. Ribs should be banned.  Ran out of cole slaw and brought freshly made that had no taste. Chicken wings were not good according to two in our party.  We left lots of uneaten food."}
{"text":"Buffalo wild wings chicken tortilla soup all i can say amazzziing. New lunch special is the bomb. Also having a community day April 22 where 10 percent of every sale goes towards the boys and girls club. How awesome is that. Fun friendly place. Even though its a bar its family oriented and feels right at home. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"It is a go to place for sports and wings.  When someone asks for special changes due to allergies for some reason they can't get the order right even after 3 times. If you want a good generic time with no changes come here. If you have any special requests DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"Dear B-dub3 waitstaff: when your customers make a special request, please consider paying attention.  For example, the other day, when we requested our order of chicken wings extra crispy?  They came out almost underdone.  Then, after sending them back and expressing our displeasure, VOILA!  Our waitress returns TWO MINUTES later with a new batch!  Well, I can do that math.  \"Wow, that was fast,\" I say, a weensy bit on the dubious side.  \"Oh, when we're this busy, we have new orders coming out all the time,\" says our over-perky waitress.  Extra crispy? PFFFFFFFFT.  Double fail.  YOU LOSE.  Sincerely,  Patron-who-will-never-be-ordering-chicken-wings-in-your-establishment-again"}
{"text":"Everything was so good! The wings where hot and fresh! The beer was huge and only $3! This is a great place to go for food or just for drinks."}
{"text":"I wanted to give BWW the benefit of possibly having a better experience on my second visit there . On this Monday night visit I was with a friend. The host seated us on the patio and informed us our server would be with us shortly and she would come back and bring me some flatware. 'Note the restaurant was not busy..' Needless to say after waiting more than 15 minutes my friend called BWW from the patio informing them that we had not been served. Beverly was very apologetic and stated someone would be right out. Well after an additional 10 mins. wait we decided to leave. As we entered the restaurant There were servers standing and sitting around. I was astonished and for what good-if any it did i shared my frustration with Beverly. She stated that those seated servers were not ours. Didn't matter. What happened to teamwork?  Needless to say I will not return to this BWW...440 E. McCullough Dr. Suite 230 Charlotte, NC"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger after work and could not have been happier.  Able to watch a little TV while waiting for my food and was not pestered at all.  The place was mostly empty, but still felt comfortable.  Would visit again if it was a closer to me."}
{"text":"7/15/2014 6:30 PM Party of three: nice waitress ALLY ask for drink request. I asked for Tomato Juice and beer. NO tomato juice only bottle mixes for alcohol. Ordered Margarita, bottle mix. Pepsi ok. Ordered 20 wings medium. Ok. Ordered salads for three,  Romain, slice of cucumber two slices of tomato hot house.  Chicken fingers fried as one big blob. Popcorn shrimp again fried as blob, but cooked dark brown. Shrimp was frozen along time it was very fishy! Waitress and service from her was excellent, but worst food I have eaten twenty years. Please don't go there. Bill was $58.00 plus tip. WOW WHAT A RIP OFF. Manager never visited request."}
{"text":"I was the first customer to use the  rest room since I went there at 11 am and it was already dirty. So gross. There are so many workers there not doing anything. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Went to this place for my boyfriend's b-day. The waitress was terrible she brought out flat soda, then disappeared we had to flag down other servers to get her for a refill, once she dropped the food off she disappeared again she knew it was my boyfriend's b-day because we showed her his ID October 3rd we waited another 15mins for them to sing happy birthday to him #NOTHING#. So wet went up to the register to pay because we never got our check because she never came back. AJ was very nice at the register, I even made up an excuse for her maybe she is smoking? AJ was very apologetic and the captain gave us a few snack coupons it was my first time there and my last!"}
{"text":"First off, they took a more flavorful approach to their lemonades instead of sour, which I love. Their strawberry lemonade is a classic must-have. If you like ginger I definitely recommend the ginger lemonade, and the blueberry mint was excellently balanced. Also, Cody was our server and he was AMAZING to my group. Really friendly and fun."}
{"text":"My family goes to this place for a few drinks, some wings and to watch the game.  The staff is awesome and accommodates any need I have, including putting the sound on a particular game I'm watching.  Great happy hour and newly renovated which makes it much easier to watch tv without obstruction.  Don't want wings?  Get the street tacos.  They're to die for."}
{"text":"Fabion  Was really generous went out of her way to make me happy with all my food and drinks she took it to another level name wrong"}
{"text":"Pass.  We went during Badger Game Day and the place was actually not busy. So I was expecting fast, quality service. We received neither.   We literally saw our waitress once when she took our orders and never saw her again. We had to flag down the manager to bring us our bill.   The food was average. Service HORRIBLE. I hate that we wasted money here and our time."}
{"text":"We were in Champaign visiting and wanted to stop for a good quick bite not knowing where to go and believing all BWW were the same. NOT! The place did have some people but the staff seemed very unorganized, and not very clean. The carpet had an odor too. The Manager popped out for a minute or two but quickly disappeared into the back.   Let me be clear that our waitress was very nice and efficient but the food was horrible. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, my friend ordered some wings. His wings were dry and tasteless. My pork sandwich was the worst pork I have ever tasted. It was lumpy, overcooked and tasteless. So after trying for a few minutes to the attention of the male manager who looked right at me as I was waving and he walked away, I finally saw my waitress and who was apologetic and offered to replace the mail. I thought ok, I was hungry and thought to give them another chance. So a few minutes later out comes a cook with my meal. Although it was better but not by much.  No manager to apologize, no offer to discount my meal or offer a free appetizer, no nothing! I will visit BWW again but not this Ever Again! If I could give it no stars I would."}
{"text":"Really like a couple of the servers that we got - includung one of the bartenders.  Sure they still have a couple of glitches and the teriyaki is not great, but all in all a fun place to yell at the tv!"}
{"text":"Couldn't find our waitress.  When she finally showed up, she rudely did not serve everybody at the table.  The bartender served us.  I demanded the check, but the waitress decided to ignore us.  I asked to speak with the manager. The manager did not introduce herself as the manager, offered to help, but instead of helping me to pay the check just walked away presumably to look for the waitress who was the origin of the problem.  Obviously lacked authority.  I paid through the batrender.  I spoke with another manager who said he wanted to help but couldn't since I hadn't paid by credit card.  If you go here, eat at the bar.  Everybody else is an idiot."}
{"text":"Came in here this week for wing tuesday! I love Buffalo wild wings, but I absoluetly hate this location! Every time I come into this location my service is terrible!!!! This tuesday we sat at the bar, the bartender got my drink and then I no longer exsisted in his world! I tried to get his attention to order and the girl behind the bar ended up taking my order. She must not liked the way I tried getting the guys attention because she immediately seemed annoyed. If she thought her attitude went unnoticed it didn't! Our food came out as ordered but that was the extent of our service! We had to ask for our check and she never came back to cash us out.   Buffalo Wild Wings is usually my choice of guilty pleasures when i'm on a cheat day and when I come in looking forward to this only to receive the worst service each time is so dissapointing!"}
{"text":"Great service and wings! Tons of blue cheese and celery. The mild wings were great, hot wings are very hot (mouth burning) and the Asian zing taste just like general tao chicken! So good. They somehow forgot the most important (and reason I chose) item on a Mediterranean salad, olives! Takeout was quick though. Excellent bar service!"}
{"text":"This used to be my old neighborhood location, so I've grown fond of it.  The only problem is the size.  It gets pretty cramped during gamedays, so if you don't get in early, don't bother."}
{"text":"This is mostly concerning the drink comping policy for gamblers.  I was at the bar playing video poker and a girl sits next to me, puts in $20, and orders a drink. She was playing for a while and was up an additional $20 when she ordered a second drink.   The bartender proceeds to explain that since she only put in $20 she can't comp another drink. The girl politely protests and explains that she has been playing and intends to play more. I backed the girl up and stated that she had been playing the whole time. The bartender, with a look of frustration on her face, reiterates and further explains that comping is not based on your play but how much you initially put in... 1 drink per $20.   The girl who was gambling asked if she can cash out and put 20 dollars of her winnings back in to get another drink. The bartender says no. This goes back and forth for a bit. I almost felt a little embarrassed for the bartender. She looked as if she would have preferred to just give the girl another drink but also said that the managers really keep an eye on them! Yeah, you wouldn't want to give a gambler a drink that costs you about a buck! Good Managing!  The whole idea of giving gamblers free drinks is to keep them playing, keep them pushing those buttons... especially if they're winning! You want them to put it back, right?  Duh!     As I was leaving I noticed the girl was now up over $100. I can only hope she cashed out and didn't give it back.  I had a similar situation 2 months ago at the BWW on LV Blvd only I wasn't informed of the comping policy as I ordered my 2nd and 3rd beer. I cash out 20 bucks ahead and the bartender brings me a bill for $15 for those beers. I think the real policy at BWW is \"If you are losing they will comp you, if you are winning they try and get some of the money back by charging you.\"  Sally Smith, the CEO of BWW, who made 3.9 million in 2014, was recently quoted as saying that BWW would be raising beer prices yet again. Uhhh! Geez!  Overpriced Beer and Wings and a tight-ass comping policy for players...Too Corporate! I think it's time to find a new place. Fortunately, there's a bar on every corner in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Living close by, it's convenient. Their food isn't terrible. The reason I give it a 3 star because of the continuous bad service, the parking, and sometimes the wait. One time that made me so angry was when I ordered my food online and went to pick it up half an our later after midnight when you have to go to the bar to pick up your food. I didn't know that. It was the first time I've ordered anything after 12. I've waited at the front for a good 40-45 minutes without anyone trying to correct me where to go. I finally figured it out myself. Went to the bar, had to wait another half hour for them to get my food, and when I left....there was someone else who had the same delimma as me of not knowing where to go. Immediately, she was directed to the bar. Where the heck were they when 'I' was standing at the front? There was another time where I had to wait an hour for my food as well after calling ahead of time. Another time, when I was seated, they forgot that I ordered anything while serving everyone else at the table. I know this because the waiter asked me if I was ready, AGAIN. So, a 3 star is actually stretching it a bit. Their food is great though! I would just recommend going to a different buffalo wild wings for that."}
{"text":"So last night for date night the boyfriend and I went to buffalo we sat at the bar and had a really good time and two very friendly bar tenders. One was Brandon and I'm not sure what the other ones name was he had left before we were done. Any ways food was delicious as always we ordered wings and chili con caso it was yummy!! As for the caption she was on point when he asked to try the different sauce. It was all around a really nice place and we will continue to go back to this location  reason for 4 stars though is the over priced drinks wasn't told on price for a mixed drink but that's ok next time I'll stick to a beer! :)"}
{"text":"I visit the Gilbert and Warner location frequently. I've had fairly consistently good service and food at that location. This location is another story.  After taking our drink order (waters and soda) it took over 10 minutes for the server to actually bring it, blaming the bar for the delay even though she filled the cups at the soda station next to our table. After our food was ordered, half the food was brought to our table right away, leaving half our party without their meals for another 10 minutes. We had two orders of wings. One order was covered in sauce, the other had a dab on each piece. It was $.60 for an extra side of sauce. After clearing our food we waited 15 minutes for the server to bring our bill then another 10 for our server to actually run payment. Needless to say, she got a $2.00 tip on a $40.00 bill.  If you are in Gilbert, just go to the one on Gilbert and Warner. The service is better, the food is better; it was worth the drive."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I've ever had at any restaurant.  They are clueless.  I like the food.   I've been to many bw's.   We won't be going back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere, whether kids are with you or not. So many televisions that if you want to talk with your group, good. If not, everyone can get lost in their own sports - trust me , it's on. Sumo Rodeo, yep. Underwater wrestling, you bet. Food and service is really good too!"}
{"text":"We used to come here more often then we do now. The food is usually good but I am not sure why you order online to pick up when it is never ready. Every time we walk in when the food is supposed to be ready we have to wait at least 10 additional minutes."}
{"text":"Love their selection of wing sauces; but, the wings are quite small.  Throw Buffalo Wild Wings sauces on some decent sized wings and we've got a winner here!  Pretty darn expensive as well.  I just spent nearly $70 on drinks and 24 wings for two - on discount wing night!    Still, though, the place has a decent vibe particularly for watching games whether it be basketball or football.  Not somewhere I'm going to frequent on a regular basis, though.  Just too pricey for the product that ya get."}
{"text":"First off, the parking here is HORRENDOUS!!  We came here to watch the UFC.  Our waiter was friendly and checked on us frequently.  I ordered boneless wings.  They were horrible.  They were mostly breading and barely any chicken.  They were so hard to chew.  We also had a pizza spring roll (I forget what it was called exactly) they were very tasty. Only thing is it cost like $6 and you only get two. They were good but not that good! Overall, I wouldn't come back for the food.  The only reason I would return is that it is the closest place for us to watch the fights."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the waiter seemed not to care about customers,  but the street tacos were outstanding."}
{"text":"Seems like these people don't give a shit about customer service. Came in for the lunch special, no host. Waited, and nothing. Walked to the take out area, a girl was on her cellphone, I had to interrupt her so I could be attended. Finally I was seated, only to have the waitress walk passed me 3 times, once with a smile. Waited a bit more... Finally I was asked if \"everything was alright?\", and when I said I hadn't been helped yet, she gave me a \"I know sir\" with a shitty attitude. Then instead of taking my order (been waiting 10 minutes at this point), she only asks if I want something to drink, when I had the menus closed at the end of the table in the obvious \"I'm waiting to order\" action. Still not able to order. Waiting another 5 minutes, until I was able to order. Keep in mind, the place is empty. As I looked around, I noticed the distracted take out girl and another waitress having a giggly conversation with what looked like was one of their boyfriends. I'm all for having fun at work, but customers come first, always.   I worked in the restaurant/customer industry for 10+ years and I was a little surprised to see a place like this with such shit service and/or interest in their customers.   Won't be coming here ever again. I'd rather take my money where my business is appreciated.   And for the only tip I will be leaving this place: hire people who give a shit. Not 16 year old girls who only worry about how their hair looks when their boyfriends walk in. Shameful place."}
{"text":"Staff is great, wonderful  service, great food an cold beer.  What could be better on a Football Sunday"}
{"text":"Tiffany Lopez is one of their best servers! Dont get me wrong they have a handful; but she stands out! For being a Bar they are very stringent on the amount they serve, but they are following the liquor law soo food is good environment is Awesome!"}
{"text":"We've had many carry out experiences at Buffalo Wild Wings  ,all great except last night \"Dijon\" asked us if  we wanted ranch dressing for tip$ he straight tried to hustle the ranch dressing . Much to our surprise NO  ranch in our carry out bag ,fortunately we had ranch dressing in the fridge ."}
{"text":"I met 2 friends here last weekend. My first time as I usually don't go to chain restaurants. We ordered 4 different appetizers: 12 wings, o-rings, garlic mushroom and a flat bread.  The flat bread was good as were the shrooms. The wings were mediocre at best (was surprised by this considering this IS their business)., dry and not great sauces. We each had 2 drinks and the cost came to $35.00 each. I couldn't believe it. I felt like I wasted my money on nothing. The server was incompetent. She actually told us that if we needed her, just wave our hands. HA! Long wait for food, long wait for the bill. Not a place I'd ever go to again. Ick!"}
{"text":"The service from the host was horrible. Particularly from the tall male Hispanic host. I asked if I could get a fork, and he was so rude in his response. The worst part is that I watched him go everywhere else except get my fork. I watched him go to the back and do nothing, I also saw him watching tv instead of getting my fork, and was just flirting with all the female hostesses on duty. After waiting 10 minutes for a fork, I asked my wonderful waitress, Vicky, for a fork. Turns out it was right behind me. She got it for me with a smile on her face. So pretty much, the rude male host working on 6/25/16 at 2-3 PM deliberately ignored me. Worst service from a worker ever!"}
{"text":"I've been here about three times... My first two experiences were OK, the food is nothing special and I've definitely had better wings elsewhere; but hey, it's a sports bar and the atmosphere is really what makes this kind of place. That being said, if you're going to a place because of the atmosphere, you better at least hope the staff will have some respect and know how to cater to you as a customer... You won't find that here."}
{"text":"It's kind of hard to rate, because I've always had good wings and cold beers. Problem is the staff. Like someone else on here said, it's pretty hit or miss.  A few weeks ago we went to BWW before a movie. We had dinner and a couple beers. We had a really nice waiter who got our order right. Food was good.  After the movie we decided to go back and have a couple drinks since it was right across the parking lot from the theater and we weren't ready to go home yet. Being a Friday night, it was considerably more crowded than before the movie.   We got sat in the bar area. Another group (much larger!!) was sat right after us. They had their beers before we even had a waitress greet us.  We finally asked their waitress if she could find our waitress. She apologized and went to get someone.  She walked over by the bar and told a waitress that she had a table. We've been waiting for OVER 10 minutes at this point. She ran over and apologized. (Our friend had noticed her earlier flirting with the bartender-she'd been standing there the whole time!!)  She said she was sorry and that she had a big party of drunk people and was dealing with them. Ummm.....hunny, we saw you standing by the bar the whole time.  Anyways, we accepted her apology and ordered. She brought out a round of beers and never came back. Finally we had to flag her down and she apologized again. We ordered a second round of beers and she forgot them at the bar. Not kidding. When we flagged her down AGAIN she apologized and said if she forgot us again to throw something at her to get her attention. Kinda felt bad for her, she was obviously having a bad night.  We wanted our check and she was nowhere to be found again!! When she finally came by she actually told us not to worry about a tip and that she didn't deserve it. Well, duh.   Their food is good but their service is sub-par. We've had a good waiter here and there, but seems like a lot of the waitresses don't have their head screwed on right."}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wild Wings! My husband and I are regulars and have been for years. We decided to stop by the Las Vegas Blvd location tonight, what a mistake! We went to the bar and played for 15mins before I had to flag down a bartender for drinks. I cashed out and have now been waiting another 15 minutes just to be acknowledged in order to cash out. The absolute worst service we have ever received at any location. The bartender seems more concerned with impressing the ladies than servicing the other customers at the bar. Not one person has smiled at us or made any attempt at even mediocre customer service. I'm disappointed at the fact that it was necessary to rate only one star."}
{"text":"Good place for a casual night out. I enjoy the wings here and since it's been recently remodeled, it's nicer. The servers are courteous and helpful. The food is always hot and presented nicely."}
{"text":"If you're stopping in for sports on TV then this is a good spot, but if you're stopping in for food...walk away! No wait, RUN away! QUICKLY! Simple cheeseburger and fries, probably the worst tasting, overcooked, flavorless, cardboard burger I've ever had!! Even the sweet tea wasn't sweet...I mean all you need is sugar!! NASTY NASTY FOOD! My mistake...won't make that one again! Server was pleasant though."}
{"text":"This place was awful!  We showed up on a Sunday around 5pm, wanting a meal before we hit the movies.  We were seated immediately in a 3/4 empty restaurant (both patios were also empty) and we waited.  We waited, we waited, we waited.  It's not that the waitstaff didn't see us.  Four different servers and a manager walked past our table (there was a total of 10 passes between them all).  After 10 minutes of waiting without being greeted, water, anything, we picked up and left.  The best part was when we walked out and one of the FOUR employees at the front desk said \"Thanks for coming!\"    Are you kidding me?  I will never eat at any of these establishments again."}
{"text":"Decided to grab a bite to eat during Speed Street. Despite being very busy inside we were seated within five minutes. Our waitress was quick to greet us and get drinks to us. The appetizer and food came out super quickly. The food was hot and fresh and excellent. Very pleased with the service we received and over all time it took from start to finish. Surely did better than I expected. I would highly recommend this place for a quick and good meal regardless of what events are taking place in and around the Nascar Hall of Fame and surrounding area. This place has great crowd control and moves customers in and out. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times before and it really just depends on the night. Some nights service is fast and great others it takes forever. You better order everything you want from the beginning or else it'll take forever to get just one additional sauce. Today our server Kimberlee was great."}
{"text":"Being that this place is a new BWW, the overall experience was terrible. Where do I start? 4 of us stopped by last night (Friday night) before going to a movie showing. We didn't wait long, which was probably the only plus out of the experience. We were walked to our table which only had 3 chairs so I had to wait for a min while they pulled the chair from who knows where. The table was all wet since they had just cleaned it apparently. The first thing the waitress asks is if we were ready to order?(2 mins from being sat down) Her name was Alexis. She brings our 4 drinks out and spills one of them on the table, luckily it didn't get on my friends fiancé.  She then walks away with the spilled drink on the table and later cleaned it with two of our napkins. We asked for an appetizer (mozzarella sticks), it arrived approx 30 mins later.  Fast forward to when the main food arrives. The food was cold( this is most likely related to the amount of time it took to get our food) who knows. .. The order was wrong for 3 out 4 people.We had to tell Alexis that we needed a new batch of wings , which she kindly replaced and took them off our bill.. The second round of drinks took 15 or more mins to arrive. We had to remind the waitress multiple times.  My buddy and I ordered the prime rib juicy burger. The prime rib was not prime rib. It looked more as if it were deli sandwich roast beef. . I've been to a diff location in where they actually use prime rib.  I will def never visit this location again. I want to add that the waitress was nice through all this, she just needs better training."}
{"text":"Pedí los fetuccini sin hongos. Un plato muy abundante, aunque bastante picante. No pude terminarlo. El ruido del lugar impide cualquier conversación que no sea Go Sports ! Esta OK, pero no volvería."}
{"text":"Haha, this place is a joke.  I took my girlfriend here and was expecting to get some fast wings for me and whatever she wanted, of course.   First of all, it took some ghetto douchebag 15 minutes to even realize we were waiting.  Then, blablabla what can I get you to drink? Both of us waters. Took him 10 minutes to get us our water. So we ordered away, after waiving him down as he ran away to flirt with some girl at the counter.   It took a long while for us to get our food, my girlfriend her burger, which was burnt to a hellish crisp.  My wings were ok, not the best but the sauce was really weird. No refills on our drinks the ENTIRE time we sat there. He only came over once.  If you're looking for good service and good food, stay away from this shithole. If you have the gas, go to Quaker Stake."}
{"text":"I havent been to a buffalo wild wings that has gotten it right and i dont think I ever will.  the atmosphere is blah and the service is just as bad.  It has nicer tvs and setup then the one in tucson but we werent greeted when we came in and there was a girl just standing there not doing much that never even asked us if we needed to be helped.  another person had to come and take us to our seats.  Wings are always good, but dont recommend anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"I took a couple of employees to BWW in Fairview Park, OH while on business.  It ended up being the absolute worst visit to a BWW I've ever experienced.  We arrived around 5:30pm and left around 9:30pm.  The bartender, Joe, who broke a glass that sprayed over my entire team and our food, had the audacity to tell us that he cannot serve us any more drinks, because we had already had too many.  We each had one drink per hour while we were there.  I then asked to speak to the manager.  The manager, Spencer, came out and before listening to what I had to say said he called the police on us.  This all came after Spencer and Joe asked us to fill out a survey, were we gave them both great reviews.  They bragged about how this would be sure to give Joe the $25 in house prize related to the survey.  Earlier, before we took the survey, Spencer explained that his boss was there and begged we provide a great survey so his boss would hopefully see it during his visit.  I'm nothing short of appalled at the way this particular BWW is managed.  If how Spencer conducted himself is deemed acceptable by BWW, I promise you I will stop taking employees to BWW.  Nor will I spend my money there personally.  I'm completely embarrassed of my decision to come to your restaurant.  I will not repeat my mistake."}
{"text":"TV's galore.  Wing flavors a-plenty.  And a fairly decent variety of brews on tap.  Our server was very friendly, happy to help out us newbies.  She brought out a bunch of different wing sauces for us to try before we ordered.  We opted for the Wild sauce and spicy garlic - both tasty!  Will definitely be back to grab some more wings and check out a big game."}
{"text":"Good food as always. Some of the waitresses need to get on the same page about how many wings come with snack, small, medium, etc. orders. Also, I'd recommend ordering your wings 'wet' if you want something other than plain. But overall, same as every other Buffalo Wild Wings... Amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been very displeased with this location. There is barely any service when I've been in, I once waited with friends at a table for over 10 minutes to even be approached by our server. Once she finally came and we were thinking about what food to order she didn't come back to take that part of our order for over 10 minutes so we left. The food I've ordered (to go) has been horrible on two occassions. I'll never go back to this location, I've had about 5 bad experiences."}
{"text":"After the location on Craig's got too popular, this was the one that we went to for MNF.  The service is just as good, but less people in the way.  It's a little bit smaller, but if you can get to the back corner of the bar, and have that big screen for your group, you're set."}
{"text":"The Buffalo Wild Wings that made me a fan.  Great location, great size, and great service."}
{"text":"Idk how this place has anything but 5 stars! The people atmosphere music cleanliness all of it was on point! The food was amazing and speedy, def hot n ready to eat aha, our server was super nice and she was very helpful the whole meal, i will be back lol"}
{"text":"Came here for Thursday special 60 cent boneless wings;) food are good. Service sucks. Every time I come here always no parking .. I love the wings and fries though so do my kiddos"}
{"text":"We were there today for lunch. We ordered 4 different types of traditional wings and all of them were crazy good. My fav was the Asian Zing. The food took a little longer than I expected but the server was absolutely amazing. Like always, Buffalo Wild Wings has a great indoor setup. Had a great time. We will be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here w/ my Father-In-Law after the movies. The first thing we noticed were TV's all around. There are two seating areas, the dining & bar section. The focal point were the huge projection screens in both sections for your viewing pleasure. I'll admit, it is new & may have a few wrinkles to iron out. We placed our order & when we received our food, the serving staff didn't bother to ask who had what & ended up handing each other opposite lunches. Overall food & drinks were good. I would suggest more personnel training & it is sure to be the place to eat & watch all your sports games."}
{"text":"This place SUCKED. I ordered the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich, and it immediately fell apart. My sister ordered a kids' meal wings, and when they brought the meal out, there were almost no wings, and they were very small. I wanted to have ketchup, so I opened up the ketchup to pour it. I tipped it over, and it came out like liquid. We also decided to order desert as well. We got the chocolate cake and cheesecake bites for desert. The chocolate cake was EXTREMELY dry, and the cheesecake bites were warm. Who warms up cheesecake? The cheesecake bites were SO terrible.   The service was terrible as well. The food came out on time; we didn't have to do much waiting. But the waitress seemed really flaky and very unfriendly. I felt uncomfortable talking to her.   I would never, ever, EVER, EVER recommend this place to any living being alive. I hated this place. It was terrible."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this location.  We waited a while for our order and my boneless wings had obviously sat under a heat lamp for a while.  My Long Island Iced Tea tasted like a virgin iced tea.  The service was a bit slow too."}
{"text":"Food is always way over cooked or makes you sick. Health Inspector needs to do a field day here."}
{"text":"Thursdays are apparently the day for boneless wings at Buffalo Wild Wings, so boneless wings it was! We tried three different sauces (mild, garlic, and mango-habanero), but all were too hot for me. Hats off to Janet, though, who is surely one of the nicest, most helpful, and most attentive waitresses ever."}
{"text":"I use to be a server in a restaurant for 4 years only reason why I didn't go to manager. But I love this BWW it has the best wings.....when made to order. I came to this place with my family and I ordered the hot BBQ traditional wing and honey BBQ boneless combo to split with my 5 yr old daughter. Quick 20 minutes later food comes out. Okay my daughter is munching on appetizers and celery with ranch trying everything. It looks great til I look at the food and stickers and realize the order is mixed up. It says hot on traditional and hot BBQ on boneless.i realize this  after I eat two wings and its hot AF so I quit eating. The server doesn't check on us the whole meal and when everyone else is done eating he says, \"oh looks like we're done eating, save room for dessert?\" I say, \"No, but..(cut off) let me get you a box and a check. And rushes away. Dude. Calm. Down.  So he comes back drops check and leaves quickly. I have to wait another 10min. He finally comes back and  I told him the sauces got mixed up I did not eat the boneless wings so he walks away saying I'll take 2$ off. We didn't even have silverware the whole time! Are we suppose to eat coleslaw with our hands now? Okay 3 min later he comes back. I say I do not want a 2$ discount I just want some boneless honey BBQ for my daughter cause that's the meal we were splitting can I just reject the discount and get a little portion of the boneless wings for my 5 yr old!? He hesitates but says sure. Comes back in 10 min with a discount on the check and wings the whole time he was in such a hurry my parents couldn't even order another beer. The restaurant has good food it really does compared to other BWW we've been to in Vegas but this is the 2nd time service has been bad. Regardless of the service we still tipped cause we aren't animals but it seriously crossed my mind to just leave him a penny."}
{"text":"First of all it smelled like sewage, we couldn't enjoy our food!!  And for it being a \"wing\" place their wings aren't that good. My favorite for wings is Uncle Bears....way better!!  Drinks (alcoholic) weren't that great either, I had to switch to a beer.  The service was ok."}
{"text":"I dont expect good service at this palce ever but i do enjoy the food. The service seems to get worse evey time i go so i just stop going."}
{"text":"me and my boyfriend went there for a late late late night out! this location is 24 hrs and when we went, the place had a lot of people in it at around 1 am on friday night! We had great priced beer for $3 and we shared the medium wings which were very good and crispy!!! The bar is where we sat and the server was very fast and greeting us and always checked up with us for refills on our beer and wings!! i forgot his name."}
{"text":"Food sucks service sucks and managers are dicks over all I hate waiting for my food and this buffalo gives you the longest wait!"}
{"text":"Server was great, place was clean, food was good. I actually didn't get wings this time, and went for chicken tenders and fries. I should have got 4 instead of 6. Filling."}
{"text":"Our server Ryan needs a lesson on customer service! We felt like an inconvenience to him. Didn't make us feel comfortable and didn't know some of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Come here once a week and have always had a great experience. I don't know his name but the bearded service is always quick with drinks and taking orders.our food wait tike on average is 15 min and it always comes out good and hot!"}
{"text":"I visited after 12 for happy hour and wanted to order, I was waiting in front of the register and no one came up to me so I walked out and stood outside and called where I saw three workers psd the phone and no one answered."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, was great to see so many of the Arizona Derby Dames hanging out and enjoying each others company! The staff was wonderful and quick!"}
{"text":"Me and three friends went here yesterday night, we used to come all the time and we hadn't been in awhile . But after last night , we won't be back . The service was great, but the dining room was closed and one of the employees was vacuuming the entire time and it was very disturbing . The food was horrible . Very dry . This place is known for there sauces but unless you get wings , you can barely taste the sauce on things . To end it all , all four of us had food poisoning today. The only reason for two stars is the service!"}
{"text":"Well I went yesterday for lunch and a great experience. I love the wings. But today I go back get seated and after 20 minutes no server comes to even take my drink order. I really hate bad customer service since its your job. Being in the Navy may have made me intolerant to things like this but I never was able to not do my job in a timely manner. I've been going B-Dubs for years but never again to this one."}
{"text":"Love watching soccer games here!  They have a great atmosphere, it's your classic sports bar scene. They have a great outdoor seating area. The bartender Kimmy is wonderful and she can handle a crowd!  I've had tons of servers there though and never been unhappy. It can get pretty crowded during certain games and fights but if you absolutely are craving BWW, you can always  call ahead and get it at their take out counter!"}
{"text":"Worst BDubs I've been to. First I will start with the good: they seem to do a lot of charity, which is awesome. We got handed a flier that if we included with our check they would donate 10% to whatever the charity of the night was, pretty nice of them.   Now to the real: Our server was so very overly attentive at first. We could tell he was working for that big tip. The thing I did not like, but my bf did not mind: our waiter sat down at our table to talk to us....I could see right through it. He actually asked us if we had seen any good movies. Now, I totally get wanting to be friendly and have a conversation with your table, but I was not there on a date with the waiter, please leave! then once we got our food we never saw him again..... dirty wing plates, napkins piling high and EMPTY BEER GLASSES hellooooooo can we get some service. It was so bad we almost found a mgr or someone else just so we could pay and get out.   Then our waiter sat down at a table NEAR us with people who seemed to be his friends for a while. So, it's not like he was really busy with tables, he had time to chill in plain sight of the tables in his section. The whole time he was sitting there we were just trying to make eye contact with him so he would come over. We just wanted to pay and leave. The food was fine, it's a chain so it is all the same. Well actually, the Asian Zing sauce was not as good as I've had at other bww if that is possible (no zing). Gonna try Hoots next time for my wing fix."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night and the service was second to none. It was not too crowded. First impression: it was well maintained compared to a recent wild wings visit and did not smell! Drinks arrived quickly as did the food, we did not have to wait at all. The waitress Stefanie checked in on us more than once. overall i was very very pleased with the level of service and the efficiency. The food was tasty and the portions were a decent size as well. Id come back. It a good venue if you are into watching sports because they have HUGE screens in every corner."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for years. Recently tho I think there is an issue with kitchen quality control. Every time we order for pick up the exact same salad they serve us something completely different.  This last time we asked for a crispy chicken salad (our favorite menu item, it is NOT A NEW ITEM.) topped with Asian Zing sauce. They gave us a buffalo chicken salad complete with blue cheese. Crispy chicken salad does not contain blue cheese. Nor is it too hot to eat.   So instead of changing the sauce on an obvious pre-made salad that I did not order.  They topped the hot buffalo sauce that was already soaked into the chicken with the Asian zing we ordered like we would not notice. My mouth is still burning. Very dissatisfied with this location. I think we will need to try another location. It is super annoying to find out your order is not fulfilled correctly when you finally get home to eat. Who has time to go back?  Terrible take out service!!"}
{"text":"I have to give 4 stars because the bar is the best place around to watch football on sunday.  They have ALL the games on so if you are hoping to watch a game other than the Packers, you never have to worry that it won't be on that week like a lot of other sports bars around. Service is always great... you never sit there with an empty beer glass waiting.  (and they wait on you for the whole game or games, not just until you are done eating) The food is really pretty decent bar food.  Good buffalo wings (for Madison) and most of the other wing sauces are surprisingly good.  Mango habanero is a favorite of ours."}
{"text":"A big group of friends and I went to this place to get some good grub before a competitive game. We didn't get waiter-ed for drinks until 15 minutes of us being seated had passed. Mind you it wasn't all that busy either and there were about 7 waiters and waitresses. Once asked for drinks we all asked for separate checks, so it would be easier to separate at the beginning because we all know the hassle of separate checks, especially for a large group. We got brought our drinks about 10- 15 minutes later... for just our order of drinks. The waitress left without asking if we were ready to order. So we waited another 10 minutes for her to come back. She took our order, the food came out in 35 minutes and we asked for the checks. She didn't return with them for 15 minutes. (There were only 7 checks.) We put our cards in the checks and waited on her to pick them up for a good 5 minutes. She picked them up was gone for 10-15 minutes then came back with them. In a rush we passed them back then booked it out of there. As we all made our way back to our cars, she comes running out of the bar yelling at us to get back in there because she hadn't run our cards. We all went back in and didn't get the situation figured out for another 15 minutes. The worst part was she had an attitude and as she gave us all our cards back said, \"See, that's why I had you all come back in.\" It wasn't our fault she didn't run the cards. She took them and someone came back with them. The only explanation was she left them by the computer to run them, got sidetracked and another waiter must have thought they were run and took them back because all those cards were unattended. Sorry for the novel, but it was one of the most horrible experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. Good food, not that great service, and I don't recommend going there with a big party."}
{"text":"I had dinner there with my kids last night.  We were in a bit of a hurry, and everything went better than expected.  Heather brought out our drinks lickity-split, and she also had our appetizier order at our table shortly thereafter.  We had a coupon and that was not a problem.  Heather handled that one with ease at well.  Our food came out right when our appetizer was finished being devoured.  There was never an empty soda cup, and our requests for extra sauces and blue cheese dressing were satisfied in short order.  All of our orders were as requested.  I've eaten at BWW on several occasions, but Heather's service made the difference on this visit. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I used to travel to the states to get wings at Buffalo Wild Wings because of there mango habenero sauce and sadly I think I'm going to have to continue doing that because the service is unbearable at this location I would imagine being a sports bar you would make sure the beer never runs low but me and 2 friends had to ask the bartender for another round and took 10 minutes to get our drinks in the first place!!!  I can't lie I sometime have no choice but to go there because of the wings I have even complained to district guess no one cares"}
{"text":"This American franchise is a hit in suburban Toronto. Although instead of huge college football crowds they're packed when the Leafs play. Great spot to watch NFL games as well as European soccer matches on the weekends. Oh yeah and the food is good as well!"}
{"text":"Don't know why I expected service to be any better at this location than centennial. Service was bad. Bartender was more interested with chatting with a friend on one side of the bar than paying attention to customers. Last time I waste my money at any buffalo wild wings for mediocre food and crappy service."}
{"text":"Horrible service at the bar. Bartenders are oblivious to customers  needing drinks. I sat here for 30 minutes with a menu in front of me and not once did I get asked If I wanted to order food."}
{"text":"Just as good as the other locations. Great food, atmosphere, and trivia. I always recommend the buffalo chicken ranch wrap, it's delicious especially if you're not in the mood for wings. If you need any assistance they have a captain named Isaac and Carlos who are both very knowledgable and has a great personality. Will be back time and time again for the trivia."}
{"text":"Great Bar Area, You can see every TV screen from wherever you sit. Lively crowd, late night."}
{"text":"Only one trivia Screen!!! Expencive but good servers. Not the best Gaming bar but still had a fun time after spending $350."}
{"text":"Horrible service, mediocre food. Our waitress came by once to take our drink order and once to take our food order. She never delivered either of those but had food runners bring them out. We finished our (cold) food and beverages (refills were never an option and definitely no waters), and waited 20+ minutes for our check. At which point I flagged down the nearest employee, waited again for our waitress, and when she did not appear, I asked for the manager. Wish we would have just walked out on the bill for his treatment, but I am an honest person. Came in around 7 pm on a weekday and will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Everything tastes the same....no matter what you order.  You should just order fried surprise since it doesn't matter what you order anyway"}
{"text":"Have been to this place a few times and it is awesome! Waitresses are welcoming and friendly. Clean and able to accommodate a car seat for our 9 month old. We ordered the mozzarella sticks, and a few different types of wings and everything was really tasty. Price is good and fair for what you get. The portions are good too. The nachos are also really good. Would recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered online 25 wings to go. Came home only got 20 wings WTF! Manager too busy to talk and will call me back! Are you serious?! Such bad service!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Buffalo Wild Wings and this is the best one. I think it starts with great management - very customer oriented. That brings up the level of the wait staff. And you might think that the food is the same at all BWWs, but that's not the case: here the cooks always thoroughly cover the wings with sauce or dry rub. This location is busy, but I've never felt I had to wait too long to get food once seated. Very well run restaurant."}
{"text":"PROS:  Tons of sauce flavors for your wings.  Friendly staff.  Full bar.  Decent food.  Great sports coverage.  Amazing fried pickles.   CONS:  Prices are high for the level of quality you're getting.  Buffalo \"chips\" that are described on the menu with a word like crispy is absolutely false.  They are grease-drenched (at least to some degree), floppy and soft. Celery and carrot quality is more miss than hit...oftentimes, it's almost white celery or rubbery carrots. They may be understaffed, because the service is sometimes slow, even though you see your server running around like a madman (or woman.)  Hate that they upcharge for an amount of sauce that should come with the orders (for 10 wings, you get 1 sauce and 1 celery or 2 sauces.)  Don't like that when you play the trivia type games, you have to wait so long in between each round for tons of commercials/ads.   When you get there for pick up after ordering online, you'll almost always wait 10 to 15 minutes past whatever was quoted to you online.  Kinda crazy.  Again, sounds understaffed."}

{"text":"Love this place, the service is always top notch. I did feel s bit dissapointed when I found out they discontinued the jammin' jalapeño. But besides that one of the best places to eat after the office with friends and co-workers."}
{"text":"Food was great, don't understand why they took my 30 cents. Cmon, it was going toward the tip anyways. Food was amazing though. I ate my burger and fries in 5 minutes. It cured my hunger. The fires here are heavenly, and try the Spicy Garlic sauce, it's godly"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. This is the 3rd BWW I have tried and the 3rd one I have left very upset. When the bartender wasn't ignoring us she was arguing how to make our drinks. They turned off the baseball game we had been watching since the beginning at the bottom of the 9th. When we asked if they could put it back on (mind you it was the playoffs last season) they said no the game lasted to long and they had another game scheduled. So we asked for our check to try and catch it at another bar but it took so long for that we missed the end.   I emailed corporate about the issue and 2 months later I received an emailed staying to bring the email in for a few entrée. NOT EVEN AN APOLOGY! Their food sucks anyways. My loyalty is to the new native down the street. 3rd times a charm and you guys failed all the way from the top."}
{"text":"Love this place. I come here when craving wings. Yes their wings are not the biggest but they make up for that through a wide range of flavours!!"}
{"text":"Went tonight and had the worst experience with the server and meal. The food took a very long time to arrive.  When it did arrive the appetizer that I had ordered came out with my meal, not before.  We ordered drinks that did not arrive until after the food was served. The waitress was very annoying and constantly cut us off while trying to speak.  I dreaded the check coming because I knew I would have to talk to her."}
{"text":"Stephanie and other bartender (I'll edit name) were amazing to watch football with on Sundays. I love being able to watch all my fantasy guys going at once at the bar there. It's really the best viewing place and environment in the city for fantasy football."}
{"text":"The worst Buffalo Wild Wings hands down. The servers are all in their own world, completely ignoring their tables. Being in the service industry, I usually try and give people the benefit of the doubt. But for the past two years, they have never once came through with their service. The other day I went in, there was vomit in the parking lot and even after notifying the employees, they still didn't clean it up. If you're looking for a great Buffalo Wild Wings, go to the one on Indian bend & scottsdale."}
{"text":"Our server was great and the food came out quick and hot. The only thing that changed it from a great meal to a shitty meal was the mid meal opera performance from another member of staff. I was trying to hear the hockey but couldn't. They need to sort this out"}
{"text":"Roman was a good server but was more interested in the fight that was going on. Our empty glasses sat on the table for a good 30 minutes and after I was gonna hand them to another server he swooped by and picked them up only to continue to watch the fight Instead of bringing them back to the kitchen. He the. Handed them off to a waitress and continued to watch the fight. Clearly he was more concerned with what was on tv than actually doing his job.We will not visit this store again.  Food was AMAZING. This buffalo girl was happy to have a taste of home so far away from home! I'm happy that there are several Wild Wings around here, hoping that they actually play the Buffalo games when hockey season starts up again."}
{"text":"Came to restaurant couple of times with my boyfriend after work. We really enjoyed our first time experience we were there. Our servers was very nice and polite. She was very prompt with our service. The second time I went I was slightly disappointed with the service I came in about 50 mins before closing Expecting a quick bite to eat since just got off work. I simply ignore by the sever in my section she didn't even acknowledge us at all, Went to acknowledge a different table to ask for their drink when they came in 10 mins after me. I sat there with 15 mins waiting with no sever acknowledging me. I had to walk to the manger and just ask with 2 waters to start with. Their bartender had to walk over and ask what we wanted to drink if we were ready to order because he saw we had not been waited on. He was very polite and apologize. Took our drink order and food order. The manger was nice of to give us two different snack size boneless wings instead of the small in place of us waiting so long. Which was really nice. Overall it was a nice experience I debt if I want to come back"}
{"text":"I live right at this corner and go here all the time! Here's why. Consistency consistency consistency! I work overnights and this is a 24hr place, big plus for me. I'm not saying this is my favorite place to eat but I know what I like there and am never disappointed.  The cheese curds would be my appetizer if I was ever given one last meal. Yes that good! The wings are always hot and juicy and I order them wet as I like lots of sauce. No Ranch or blue cheese need for me. Just good bar food yes but the same every time, so nice not to be disappointed. This is specifically Durango and warm springs location, as I live right there. I go mostly overnights and always the same few people working, huge plus for me! My sample size is from when they opened to now. This is not just one good visit. I go often!"}
{"text":"For the record, my boyfriend and I usually order take out over the phone maybe twice a month from here, and they did a fine job. But tonight, we had ordered online to try it out. Big mistake! We got there at the time it had said, (7:40 on a Sunday night) and the take out girl said that the online orders weren't going through, so she put in our order as our order ticket was in her hand! Let me note that your address, phone number and e-mail have to be included when you order online. So we were confused as of why she hadn't called us to confirm our order.  Anyway, we wait for our order that she said would take 5 minutes, but ended up being ten. We get home and we had ordered two orders of boneless wings, one mild and the other being split flavors. My boyfriend had his boneless mild, and mine were traditional wings! Even our emailed receipt said boneless on both orders. I'm not a fan of their traditional wings because they are quite soggy to me. I'm not sure if we will be ordering take out from this location anymore..."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible,  TERRIBLE. We were seated quickly but it was all downhill from there. Took almost 15 minutes and me flagging someone down before our drink order was taken. Another 10 before our waiter finally appeared. Extremely long wait to get our food and then the order was wrong AND cold. Someone get me out of here.  The only redeeming thing that happened was the general manager eventually brought out our correct order, apologized profusely and discounted our bill for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"BW3 was a good place to catch all of the NCAA tournament action this weekend.  Our waitress was great and even put the Purdue game on one of the large TV's for us. Good beer specials and plenty of choices on tap.  They have a great app sampler... which just happens to be my favorite food group.  Like many NC restaurants there is smoking in the bar area, but good ventilation so it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"One of my hubby and I's favorite places to go any day  of the week! Matt.C. is an amazing waiter, whether he's ours or not, but his energy and eye for detail are to be applauded:) We love the variety of wing sauces and variety of types of wings are great.  Although this is a new franchise to this area, we are familiar with it from travelling in the U.S., but this is by far the best location.  The mozzarella sticks and marinara sauce are the best and all the staff seems to be happy working there.  The managers are also attentive and we got free dessert one night when we were wearing our Bruins jerseys (the manager was a Toronto fan and wanted to make a piece offering after the series we beat them in, lol).  We go often enough the servers know us and the drinks are always terrific.  Very good Caesar drinks with enough garnishes for an appetizer in itself...love the pickle!"}
{"text":"Service was TERRIBLE! Food is mediocre at best and over priced! . Manager came to our table and asked if we were enjoying ourselves.  I told him we needed drink refills. He said he'd take care of it and disappeared.  After waiting for quite awhile I went up to him and told him he had said he would take care of getting us drinks. He was kind of snippy and said she's right there.  Our server had finally showed up to get us refills! I told the manager that she had just now shown up. He came over and apologized. Then she brought us our check without checking to see if we needed boxes which we did. We had asked for separate checks which we did not receive! Then we waited and waited and waited for her to come pick up the check because we needed change. Had to flag the manager down once again! We will NEVER go back there!"}
{"text":"In comparison to like minded and styled sports bars and chicken wing joints BDubs is supreme.  Aside from the wings the fried mushrooms are delicious but the southwestern dippers are nothing to sneer at."}
{"text":"I can put away wings, in fact I offer to eat them dry with just a squeeze of lemon, this way I can fill up without burning my insides.  They have great specials, and as far as splats bars go, there isn't many out there that can compete with what they have going on.  Oh yea, the fried mushroom appetizer is my favorite item on the menu that doesn't \"Cluck\"..."}
{"text":"I did not have a good experience at this location.  Service was slow on a not so busy night.  Food was not at it's usual quality.  Have not been back to this location.  I prefer the one a few miles south."}
{"text":"Make sure you sit where you can see the game you want on a big screen  they will absolutely refuse to change a big screen to the home teams game. Will never come back here! Zero stars"}
{"text":"The worst customer service from MIKE! Unprofessional rude& completely just turned me off from this place wont be coming or Ordering here again!!!!!! Open 24 hours but if you call for a pick up after hours you get treated like garbage& lied to!"}
{"text":"Large Draft beer selection, talented bartenders, and a diminutive manager make for a happy night for me and my friends"}
{"text":"Stay away from this one, service was acceptable for a chain. Food was OK but extremely small portion. After complaint to manager (who was rude)... I was sent home hungry and out $12 for a 4 ounce chicken sandwich, side of onion rings and lemonade !!!"}
{"text":"This place is nasty. A have friends who recently contracted food poison from their bone in wings. Someone in that kitchen isn't cooking food right. I'll never go back. Drive to a different location."}
{"text":"Not a great place to have a meal or even a drink for that matter. Tried it a few times and have always been let down by service first and then the food. The last time the manager just kept trying to give me free wings.to make up for the problem of 12 wings taking 40 minutes. So he thought paying off was better than addressing the issue of their horrible service. (I didn't take the free wing coupons because I won't be going back.)"}
{"text":"Honey bbq wings and a ice cold blue moon is the most yummy thing in the world. I cant eat this every day but i will say that at least once a week. I love that they let you try all their sauces for the wings, im thinking of changing my honey bbq for something more spicy. Also try the fried pickles, Very good.  I have never encounter any problems with the service, always quick refills!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food is basic. Servers and management are very slack. Wont go here anymore."}
{"text":"I keep coming back here every three months or so, and each time it's worse. Ordered a snack of 5 wings, and two were just embarrassingly scrawny. Overpriced, long wait, drinks never refilled, marginal service.  It's me. It is. I'm an idiot for coming back here. [slapping self]. Stupid, stupid, stupid!!"}
{"text":"I would have liked to stay for a second beer to watch the steelers game but I never saw my server ( Amy). Had to track down other servers to get her to come over. Food was good and great sports atmosphere. But the service needs a major overhaul."}
{"text":"DON'T COME IN FOR LUNCH!!!! Came in on our lunch break because we work around the corner. After waiting 10 minutes for drinks. We finally got our order in and food didn't come for another 30 minutes. 45 minutes later, the manager tells us to call ahead next time.   They did discount our meal but that was after I complained to the manager, who told us to call in ahead of time."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!! This has been the worst service we have ever received in any restaurant in Glendale Westgate. The waiter only delivered half our order and then after asking three time to see the manager and complaining we NEVER got a manager table visit. We had to go hunt down a manager and plead our case. Another waiter admitted our waiter was on drugs and couldn't function. After 2 hours and 15 minutes we were finally served our missing orders. Then after some negotiations with management they agreed to comp the meal. Ugh!! What a disaster and frustrated experience. The food was good but good grief what a mess. If I could give a negative star I would."}
{"text":"Yuck. The food was terrible. The fries were cold, then microwaved. The waitress was nice enough but not very attentive. The atmosphere isn't very comfortable. I don't see a reason to go back."}
{"text":"Expensive for wings and a beer. Food was good service was poor. Friends from Australia were in town and wanted to have pub food. Wasn't impressed at all servers were very unfriendly made us feel unwelcome. Wouldn't go again find a local pub instead."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly staff!  I would swear by the Roasted Garlic Mushrooms - you definitely won't regret ordering this!!  Our server was very attentive and pleasant. The \"entres\" did take a little longer than expected to arrive; however, our appetizer (roasted garlic mushrooms!) came right away, and ultimately, it was worth the wait. 5 STARS!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, and the food doesn't taste fresh. I've ordered to-go meals a few times from this location, and the results have been mediocre to bad. The past couple times I've gotten there when they said the food would be ready, but ended up waiting fifteen to twenty minutes. Today, I had a really simple order, but they still screwed it up and gave me the wrong flavor of wings. I'd recommend going to Teakwoods on Ray Rd instead; they have better prices and better food."}
{"text":"Been to a few BWW's. The one by my house a few times a month. But this BWW is by far the best one I've been to. Matt behind the bar was awesome. Food was quick and good quality. Perfect amount of sauce on the wings. And what better place to save a buck and eat on the strip."}
{"text":"This review is about this particular BWW...I LOVE B-Dubs! I eat at B-Dubs all over the country as my job requires that I travel A LOT! This BWW is low on my list. The atmosphere is dark and drab probably because of the outdated giant projection screen over the bar... They are EXTREMELY conservative with the sauce on the wings. I even asked for extra because of some of the other posts here but still...almost dry. I did have a good experience with the staff. They were all very nice to me and made sure my drink stayed full. Food came out quickly and was still hot...If not for those 2 things I would have given this rating 1 star. This BWW just needs to brighten the place up and not be so stingy with the sauce..."}
{"text":"No matter if it's a good or bad experience my husband and I alway find ourselves talking about what a good manager this location has. He is always open to help his employees. Not sure of his name but he is tall and slim. Kudos Sr. We the regulars to this location notice everything!"}
{"text":"It's a BW3, what do you expect?  Often loud, especially when a game is on.  Not necessarily a bad thing.  Lots of TVs, and a trivia game if you want to be more interactive.  2 stand-up arcade games.  Full bar.  Limited taps, but always have the Capital Brewery seasonal.  Pretty good service.  Take out service too.  Plenty of parking.  The fried pickles are tasty.  Note: They also have SCVNGR challenges - download this app and it's super easy to get $5 off a $25 bill your next time there."}
{"text":"Came in here a couple nights ago and it was horrible!!! Worst customer service and the managers do not know how to deal with a problem their employees make instead they just charge the customer extra money!!! The manager lady with blonde hair was loosing her cool and couldn't even deal with the customers problem & I was talking to her nicely I could've been an asshole like her but I wasn't."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch after bad service over a year ago. Well some things never change. Few customers and numerous wait staff. We were seated promptly then watched two other booths seated after us. Next thing  we know, it's 10 min later and still no server yet the other 2 groups had drinks and servers. We asked twice for a server, the second time they all stood at the hostess station debating who was to wait on us. We got up went to manager who was about as slow as his servers. NEVER GOING BACK, No wonder they already failed once, this place SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"Your typical Buffalo Wild Wings franchise.  TV's are placed well, and no bad seat in the place.  Drink specials most of the time, and they show most UFC and boxing PPV's."}
{"text":"BWW is one of those places where you have to know what they are good at, and focus on that. BWW is good for: wings, bar food, beer, and the game. That's about it. If you're expecting gourmet burgers, look elsewhere. If you want a place to watch all of the games and get reliably decent wings, they hold up.   Are they the best? No. Still, I never have to guess about what I'm going to receive, and the quality of the product they do best is quite good. If you go for lunch, sit at the bar and get one of the specials. Not bad for under $10 with a drink."}
{"text":"It's a chain, so I'm not going to comment on the food.  I've been to other Buffalo Wild Wing locations, and they are fine.  Wings, sauce, beer...it's all good.  The only reason I am reviewing this place is because the bartenders and service were absolutely HORRID!!!     \"We are attitude!\"  There are plenty of great places in Uptown Charlotte...please help to put THIS one out of business!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. We had a party of 4 and we of course all ordered together. It started off bad and went to worse. We asked for sauce for the appetizers and after asking 3 times we finally got it. At that point they also delivered the main meal so 2 people were done with their meal and the other 2 hadn't even started their appetizers. We never were asked if we wanted dri k refills. When the other couple went to start their dinner it was wrong and had to be sent back. It came back a second time and was still wrong and had to go back again. On the third attempt they got it right but everyone was so frustrated that they asked to take it to go. A server came up and said to one of our party is shows your day going. He quietly said not too good and the server responded that maybe tomorrow will be better. Not us there anything wrong or anything I can do for you. After spending 100.00 you would expect decent service but it was terrible and they weren't even busy. I contacted the manager to let them know what kind of staff work there. Stay far far away. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Guys, free limo ride to and back from one of the best exotic clubs in Vegas. No cover - free limo anywhere within 10 miles of Vegas strip. Two drink minimum purchase! Contact me for more details! Bottle service specials! VIP! I got it all!"}
{"text":"Second online order. Great experience this time! Jordan  at the front desk counter who assisted with my order was very accommodating and made this experience a pleasure!"}
{"text":"We waited for about 20 minutes for a waiter, we were never served so decided to leave.  We did notice that there was staff looking at us but never attended worse service ever.  Would never go back this location!  Staff needs to be re trained for customer service!"}
{"text":"I have never eaten in this place and decided to give it a try last night. The first thing I want to commend is the service. Well, at least the person who took our order and kept our ice water and soda flowing.   I ordered the Mango Habanero wings and a basket of Salt and Vinegar fries. Incredible! The wings were delicious, cooked perfect and though hot very, very enjoyable. The fries actually were mixed with some lemon spice too, so they were lemon, salt and vinegar. Even though we actually ordered the spice on the side the kitchens mistake in mixing the spices made a very delicious basket of fries. Yum!!!!  I'd definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Just went there and it was pretty good.  Service was good, what you'd expect from a chain and on a friday night when it was busy.  Server missed my friends app order, but could've been his fault for not being too clear.  Other than that, the only con I have about the place is the beer price.  7 bucks for a tall Newcastle, I guess thats standard Vegas.  Bland Decor, but who cares, TV's for days...Probably gonna go there on sundays for NFL, should be great.  Oh yeah, and open 24hrs, pretty Sick imo, enjoy"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite before heading to watch the NFR. Sat down in the bar right away. The staff was super friendly and took our drink and food order. Food came super fast and the manager even came and talked to us for a bit. They were even nice enough to put the rodeo on the tv. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Avoid. Chicken is mediocre and service is horrible. Ordered at 2 PM for a 5 PM pick up. Didn't get out of there until 6 PM.  My order was incomplete. I had to wait 40 minutes for them to cook some additional chicken. How long does it take to fry chicken?  Then they forgot the sauce. That took another 10+ minutes for someone to go to the back and fill up two small tiny cups of sauce.  Seriously. When you mess up an order how about prioritizing the correction? This place is dead to me."}
{"text":"Food was gross. Wings were soft and barely had sauce. Threw 17/20 away. Didn't bother asking for another order. Horrible. Great service. Horrible chicken."}
{"text":"It's the second time I have had a terrible and horrible experience here. Never going back. The hostess was rude, took 25 minutes for my drinks to be ordered,  my appetizer never arrived, my food was cold, th e waiter was talking smack about other customers, my bill was overcharged for stuff I didn't order. I was there for about 3 hours, not enjoying,  just been patient. My alcoholic drink was nasty, the wings were cold and I was charged for the appetizer that never arrived. Horrible!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was a good place to watch the Super Bowl.   Our waitress was very nice and made the time to check in and chat with her customers.  Drawings for prizes was a nice touch as was playing music during the 35 minute extra intermission."}
{"text":"This particular BWW gets a solid 5-star from me, mostly for the bar staff here. I moved here in June and have gone at least once a week, every week since! The entire bar staff knows my name, my drink order(s) and how I like my wings prepared. My roommate and I are greeted with smiles from the bar as soon as we walk in the door. Even when we aren't drinking, we sit in the bar because we know we will always be taken care of. I'm not sure about the rest of the servers, but definitely make sure you ask for Jaymee, Sam, Staci, or sit at the bar top and talk to Mark. They're all awesome and the wings are never a disappointment. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants good wings and excellent service."}
{"text":"Very bad service. In fact worst I've ever had. Always missed food on my order and I've ordered many times. Kept trying and always the same. The food was good at first but went downhill. This could have been a great hangout."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Mentioned to our server Shannon that were heading out to a movie and she took care of us and made sure we had plenty of time to make our show. Wings were very meaty and delicious. Love the atmosphere of lots of sports and action. Great spot. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went there 3 times for lunch, twice for takeout and once eating in. All 3 times, I got food poisoning. The chicken was half cooked and didn't have all the toppings that it said it would on the menu. The service is so slow, even during their lunch hour. It took almost an hour for our food to finally come out!! Needless to say, I will not be returning to BW3."}
{"text":"If your namesake is wings, they should be awesome. And at BWW, the wings are merely mediocre. They do offer a wide range of sauces but nothing stood has stood out so far in my experience. They offer all-you-can-eat wings on Thursdays during lunch but their idea is to wait the customer out - we were there for 75 minutes with a very light crowd and we only got to re-fill our baskets (4 wings at a time) three times. That's barely passable service.  In terms of their drinking selection, BWW is really missing the mark. They understandably are catering to the sports fan crowd but to make it synonymous with only mass produced beer is terrible. There are so many craft options they could incorporate, especially local in Phoenix, and they really could do better if they aspire to be a go-to bar.  There is nothing wrong with BWW, there are just so many other good options, especially for their price point."}
{"text":"I ordered online for food to be ready by 12:20pm.  Arrived at 12:15pm and waited until 12:55 to recieve my order.  I was offered the 'food' for free, but I turned it down.  I do not go to a restaurant for free food, okay!  Get home only to find that the boneless wings have been wayyy over cooked and with barely any sauce on them.  Complete garbage.  Don't waste your TIME or MONEY with this restaurant, there are plenty of other options!  TWO BIG THUMBS DOWN!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this establishment. In fact, in the last 2 days I have had poor experiences with BWW's both times resulting in me taking my business elsewhere. This location specifically turned me, my wife, and children away because my children came in with frozen Yogurt from a neighboring yogurt spot. The manager said if he let us in with the FroYo he would have to allow everybody to bring their own food in. Really?! Is BWW not confident enough in their own food offerings they feel the need to have such a policy?! They should be supporting nearby businesses as they would want the same support in their direction! Plus, they don't sell FroYo so it's not like we tried bringing in \"the competitors\" food. What they fail to realize is we would have spent an easy $50+ dollars there as a family anyway because my kids bringing FroYo would have no affect on the business we would have given them. On the other hand, because they turned us away, they lost our business (again). I would not recommend this location and starting to rethink ever recommending BWW ever!!"}
{"text":"Went here one night with a date because I had the taste for wings.She wasn't really hungry so she ordered the fried mushrooms (not enough to curb appetite) i preceded to order my wings and I finally decided on the Mango/Habenero,while waiting for my wings I ordered a draft beer after finishing the first one the bartender didn't even acknowledge me to see if I needed a refill.So in my final thoughts the wings were awesome and the beer was cold,but the bartender was frigid..."}
{"text":"Was a busy night had no open tables but had self seating in bar area.  Was able to find a table fast had our drinks in 3 mins and food in 10 min.  Great for a busy Saturday night."}
{"text":"Want to give this place 0 stars but yelp wont let me..  Our waiter was a terrible host from the start with his greeting.. \"How are you guys? Im bleh eh bleh. He mumbled for some reason.  Next was how he gave us our food, he threw the bone trays in front of us like we were some kind of animals lol. Next we asked him for ranch, he told us about how it was 60 cents but we didn't mind and ordered it anyways. It took about 30mins to get five ranch dipping sauces. Are you serious ? Lol. And to end the service with a bang, two of my friends asked for a refill on their waters. He comes back with the check and their waters, HALF WAY FILLED AND WITH NO NEW ICE. This dude was out of his mind with that kinda service. Never going to this location again. On the receipt his name was Phoenix, so if you see him just ask for a new waiter. Have a good one and hope you guys take my advice."}
{"text":"Wings are my guilty pleasure, but don't bother ordering in person if you're not a drunk half-naked female. You won't hold their attention long enough to get it right. The guy taking my order could barely keep his eyes open, but every time a girl in just a bra walked by, he tuned me out entirely while his whole head followed her movements. We were missing some things but I didn't want to remove any clothing to make reordering worth my time."}
{"text":"I've had better wings and service elsewhere, but our friends wanted to meet here last night so we hoped our opinion would be changed. Unfortunately, it was worse than previous experiences. We had a large party and sat out on the patio. Our waitress basically informed us that it was \"crazy\" inside, so sorry if she neglects us. Some people at our table got their drinks and some of us waited and waited. Finally, the manager came out and apologized, and said that the fries and cheese curds were late but they were on the way! Funny enough, we already had the fries and cheese curds on the table but we were still waiting for all the rest of the food. Long story short, our food was never put in and we had to get it in to-go boxes because it had been so ridiculously long. We did get 1 drink taken off the bill but I didn't really feel like that did us justice for the totally unfortunate experience. I give it two stars because the chips and queso was pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Good service, and nice staff, when there are a lot of customers things can be a little slow, however good food, highly recommend"}
{"text":"Normally my experience is good here, but tonight I ordered a side of the fries/cheese and almost got sick. The plastic coating on the bottom if the box melted into the food and thankfully we caught it before eating too much."}
{"text":"Wings + Beer + Football = LOVE  I am such a girly girl 99% of the time but come fall, I sort of turn into a dude.....  This is not my most favorite place to catch the game, but a good alternative when I want to mix it up or my team is on a bye week. Good selection of boneless wing flavors.  Oh god, just writing this makes me yearn for the season to begin!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty mad this place wants me to try the new sauce only to be out of it. Come on BWW get your self together"}
{"text":"Liz, Jessica and Tara are the best bartenders.  They are very attentive and make sure you are happy.  I wish every restaurant had even close to the service they provide.  They set a very high bar that has yet to be passed."}
{"text":"Super cheap wing Tuesdays and Thursdays. I had always preferred traditional wings (Tuesday) over boneless wings (Thursday). Personally the boneless wings somehow do not feel like I'm having wings. Despite being easier to eat, I would like my wings experience to be messy, but that is just me =)  I have tried a huge variety from the non spicy Sweet BBQ  to the extremely spicy Wild.  Some favorites are Parmesan and Garlic, Honey BBQ, Asian Zing and Mango Habanero.  The Wing Tuesdays is the only reason for showing up. It's a great way to get cheap food."}
{"text":"I normally don't go to Buffalo Wild Wings but went in because Discount Tire would have my truck for over an hour.  I ordered an appetizer sampler, it took about 40 minutes to come out, it was cold. I started to eat it then realized how cold it was. I told the waiter and his response to me was \"since you ate half, would you like me to bring out another half?\" I said no, because his answer implied I was looking for a handout. I explained the situation to the manager and he empathized. I told the manager that if I was the owner I would hate for my customers to have this type of experience because they will not come back. He again empathized and I insisted on paying for my food.  I payed my full bill and left a normally good tip, however I will not return. I hope my experience is not indicative of everyone else's experience. All I can do is report what I experienced. I hope if you go your experience is better than mine... Roll the dice and good luck!"}
{"text":"Bdubs is an ok spot. Wings are great except on Tuesday. They are just ok. I think they use cheaper wings or something. This seem to be a pretty good franchise. Servers are always friendly. Food comes out quick. I come here often have not had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"My friend visiting from Texas was familiar with BWW, so we decided to give it a try. I had explained that I have had SEVERAL bad experiences there, but hadn't been in some time (6 months).  The staff was friendly, but totally didn't know the menu. I ordered a bottled beer (craft) and the waitress had never heard of it before.  I asked about the Beefy Burger (soooo totally named wrong) and whether or not it was made with the \"slider\" sized patties and she said \"Oh no, its the big patties. It's a huge burger\"! With that being said, I ordered it. SLIDER sized patties and the \"Shaved prime rib\" was non existent. I have had better burgers for half the price (the BEEFY Burger was $11)  Although friendly, the staff was lazy. They all seemed to huddle around the side of the bar and talk. The bartender even ignored his customers at the bar.  I will never visit this location again and suggest no one visit it either. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Came here with a girlfriend and we had the worst service! We waited at the front for a few minutes before we realized that there was no \"host\" so we wandered into the bar side.   The bartender was also serving and she seemed very rushed. She recommended a drink that we didn't end up liking. Our bartender/server never came back to see how we were doing, we found out later that she left for the day! Like what?! If you're leaving, at least come over and say you're leaving for the day and someone else is coming over to help us...  A different server came a little later and asked if we were okay and I asked her where the server was and she said she left... I told her we did not like our drinks so she said the manager would come over.   Manager ended up only taking one drink off and took another 5 mins to get our bill."}
{"text":"The best time to come here is late nights, when only the bar is open. The second best time is lunch hour to early dinner (before 6). Those times, service is amazing and the food is great.   Outside those times, service is lackluster. I've had servers deliver the food, ask if we need anything, and then vanish after we tell them what ... leaving us without utensils to actually eat the food, making is stop a waitress five minutes later to actually get those.   The bartender on most nights is amazing and always does a good job of keeping up on things, even at two in the morning. Hats off to a decent place for food at obscene hours."}
{"text":"Lots of TV's, Wings are great, but not a huge fan of all there food. Nacho's are similar to what you get at a ball game."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with my softball team you could tell things were a bit unorganized.. A few things were forgotten but they did a great job to take care of the problems. Also our server seemed to handle everything well despite the problems. Way to totally redeem themselves"}
{"text":"Horrible place to take kids to eat, very. Dirty and disgusting probably we will not ever come back again they need to focuss on the time of the food it takes too long, server was great but the kitchen needs some work on timing"}
{"text":"Got Absolutely NO Service!  On Saturday December 25th I arrived at this establishment just before 3:40PM.  I called ahead to ensure they would be open since it was Christmas Eve and they lady on the phone said they will be closing at 6PM.    As I walked in, the place had only one table occupied and one of the servers just stared at me as I walked in.  I said hello with a smile and she barely managed to respond to me.  I sat at the bar and there was only one other person sitting next to me.  There was a bartender and a manager on duty at the time.  The main dinning area had one table and the bar dinning area was completely empty.    It was my hope to catch of bit of football and have 2 lbs. of wings and 2 pints.  I literally sat at the bar for over 15 minutes and the bartender OR the manager could not even make time to take my order or even say hello.  The bartender was cleaning, walking around & chatting with the other customer.  I was blown away since i have never seen this behavior at any dinning establishment.  I drove over 10KM to have their wings and beer and was totally snubbed and ignored.  Not sure why they decide to open the doors to the public if they will NOT service their guests as they walk in."}
{"text":"so i'm watching the diamondbacks game on the big screen in the bar with other people, two people come in and i see them talking to the waitress before they sit down. seconds later the diamondbacks game is off  and the brewers game is on, are you kidding me, you walk into a milwaukee sports bar, tell them to change the brewers game to a diamondback game and you'll get laughed right out of there. Service is great, but remember what city this sports bar is in wild wings."}
{"text":"Consistently bad service regardless of the time of day... I have gone both for lunch (when not busy) and happy hour... horrible.  Totally horrible service :( Not unfriendly, just total lack of enthusiasm and VERY, VERY slow......be prepared to wait!!!!"}
{"text":"I was at the bar to watch the NBA finals at the bartender sucked! It took him forever to get me and my buddy refills and it wasn't even that busy. My friend started feeling sick so he wanted a water and it sick and just wanted a water and it took him seriously like 30 minutes just for a water. He's and older gentleman with slick back hair. He lied about comping our drinks when me and my friend were gambling and I also went to the bathroom and he ended up taking my drink assuming I left. Horrible experience! The food was great though!"}
{"text":"Negative stars! Went last night 11/18/15 for happy hour the waitress that attended us had short blond hair in a little pony tail Monroe piercing I believe anyways worst service of my life... She didn't let us know it was happy hour, didn't give us straws, didn't give us ranch like we asked and we couldn't even tell her because she would leave before we could tell her anything! Im polite and pretty easy to please and I noticed she was like that to only out table she was so friendly and flirty with the others it was ridiculous! She needs a new job"}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere ...service is ok but what do you expect haha. Went in last night at 10. No one seated us for 10 minutes we seated ourselves. No one greeted us. Tried to flag down the bartender but she didn't see us . We got up and went to apple bees and had a wonderful time. Won't be back for awhile. Bw3 you have some hospitality lessons to learn."}
{"text":"First time here and probably last. Service was poor, food was bad and it took forever on a Tuesday when the place was empty. It took 25 minutes for an order of 5 chicken wings - which is supposedly their signature item!!!  What happens when they are actually busy?    In a market that is saturated with sports bars, there are DEFINITELY better alternatives. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Review is for their takeout.  There are over 15 people in line to pick up their orders and only one person helping them in addition to answer the phones.  There is hardly anyone seated at the restaurant and staff is standing around.   Not sure what the manager is doing."}
{"text":"The food was just okay even though I really liked the jerk wings. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for it, but the music was too loud and there were too many TVs and hyper-stimulation. I was a little overwhelmed and underwhelmed at the exact same time."}
{"text":"Had to spent an extra half an hour and gas to drive back. Wanted traditional, and marked as traditional on receipt, but got boneless. Careful with take-outs..."}
{"text":"What a waist of time coming here tonight. I wanted to enjoy some wings and a couple of beers and watch da Blackhawk. Depending on who you talk to that works here, you get a lame ass excuse why they can't change a TV in here. The place is very quiet and no one is watching. I guess it's one beer and then home. Very disappointing BBWs!!"}
{"text":"I walked in and applied last Sunday. I am a highly experienced server and a valuble asset to any team. I talked to Carry and after glancing at my references and my previous employment he was impressed and scheduled an interview with me for Tuesday at 4pm. On that very Tuesday, whilst getting ready, I received a phone call. It was carry. He called to inform me he hired FOUR people the day before and that there were no more positions open. I was astonished. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Both of my parents are business professionals, and it blew us away that such a (previously believed) professional corporation would break a commitment three hours before my interview. I have a wife and children and I do not have time to be screwed around. If you are reputable in your business (which you are obviously not) you would have at least interviewed everyone you had scheduled appointments with before making your decision. I'm not upset I didn't get hired, I'm upset that such a widely known establishment would have the audacity to break a commitment made so close to the appointment. It seems you have forgotten but I am not only a working man, but me and my whole family were pretty loyal customers, \"were\", Being the keyword. I hope you treat hopefuls better in the future."}
{"text":"they have like 50 waiters.and no helped me, i ordred online and it said the food would be ready at 10:20  and i didnt get it until 11, i dont understand why it takes so long for wings, by the time i got home which i dont live but 5 mins down the street it was all cold, not worth the money. go to pizza hut"}
{"text":"It took over 45 minutes for our food and it sucked. hahahaha"}
{"text":"Never stepping foot in a BWW again. We had a large group, and I get that it's tough to keep 15 people straight, but this was awful. My food and my wife's came out 8 minutes before everyone else's. Then food sort of started trickling out for others. Three of our party waited 25 minutes after we had gotten our food to get theirs. After we were done, it took another 30 minutes for the hapless waiter to figure out our tabs. So service was really truly terrible.   And oh yes, the food. I wanted to try a number of sauces, so we got four. They were all either very sweet, or assaultively vinegared. I love fried pickles, but they were undercooked so the batter was still uncooked on the pickle side. Caesar salad mushy and just south of Meh. And you know how carrot sticks, if they've been out too long, start to get kind of ragged and fuzzy? Yeah, they were that.   The beer was good. Other than that, not so much."}
{"text":"Awesome service awesome food and an amazing time overall !!!!!! Went to watch the raptors game and it was packed but the waitress was still attentive and amazing! Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"This has been my 3rd visit (2nd since remodel) and the first time the pages of the menu weren't stuck together. Shockingly even the tables were clean. Was greeted at the door by the entire wait staff who proceeded to hang out by the front door and BS for almost the entire 10 mins we waited for someone to take our drink order. Needless to say we walked out. Not sure how this place stays in business. Would love to have another local choice for dining and hanging out. Sad to see the money spent on the remodel that didn't change much of the decor anyway. Soap and water, a wait staff attentive to customers, and a manager cracking the whip would have been a better way to improve the restaurant. Wish I had a better review to offer. Unfortunately, I've given the place 3 tries. Just thankful that my sleeves didn't stick to the goop on the table this last visit."}
{"text":"While attending an event at nascar hall of fame I thought I would stop in at BWW while in the area. Let me just start out by saying this... Don't go. Food is from the frozen section at the grocery store.... Go for the beer.  The end."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a friend because he wanted to go there I've never gotten this place the food was mediocre the atmosphere was your typical chain fried food beer spot again I don't get it I would never go myself and they're overpriced"}
{"text":"This is a good place to get together with friends, but nothing special to go alone. It can get loud at times, but what bar doesn't? My biggest pet peeve is that this is just a typical sports bar with a typical, sub-par, beer lineup. They have 25-35 taps (never really counted), and most of them are cliche beers. I never understood why they needed coors light, miller lite, bud light, bud, PBR, and Mich Ultra on the same lineup, due to the fact that they are virtually the same. Yes, I know they're going to be your top sellers with good margins and quick turnaround, but take 1 or 2 off and throw some better crafts on tap. Their crafts are just as cliche, with your typical Fat Tire, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, 312 Urban Wheat. I do like that they support local with some Four Peaks brews, but overall, the tap lineup is a let down, but tolerable. I've never eaten here, but I'm sure the food is just as good as any other sports bar restuarant. I wouldnt ever choose to go here, but if friends decided to meet there, I would join."}
{"text":"The customer service here is so terrible. I called and they didn't even say hello or anything they just put me on hold. This is the second time this has happened. The last time they kept me on hold just to tell me they weren't taking orders anymore and I had to come in to order. This would not have been a problem if I wasn't coming from work and would have missed the last call for food. They are very rude at this location."}
{"text":"First want to say this doesn't pertain to everyone that works at this location. I have been going to this location for a couple years and about once a month- 2 months. And I would say that I have had good service twice. The hostesses are great and bartenders but the waitresses we have had suck. This might not pertain to everyone but the ones that suck, you know who you are. We get food late, beers sit at the bar waiting for waitresses to go pick them up until I have to ask them to go get it. Also, when they finally show up, their excuse is \"sorry I was talking in the back and forgot\". I have given this place a ton of chances and I can guarantee we aren't coming back again. Stay away from this one. Other ones I am sure are better!!"}
{"text":"Nice place. A little too salty, but the Parmesan garlic is fantastic."}
{"text":"The service is great here! Our waitress, Alyssa, is always checking to see if we need anything. This type of service, I usually only experience at a fine dining restaurant. The location is great since its so close to ASU! Our wings and appetizers are amazing and hot!"}
{"text":"Seating hosts are horrible. We have come twice and they took 1 hour to seat down for party of 12 the first time. Then they took almost everyone's orders wrong & we had to complain to manager who offered a small discount.  We gave them a second chance so we come for a 2nd time, it was only 5 of us. The place was empty and 2 or 3 hostesses took more than 5 minutes just to find us a seat. They sat us on a very low lit area with the AC hitting our baby so we asked to move. When we did the hostess takes our menus away and disappear and never came back. We left and not ever going back. Place is big but service sucks!"}
{"text":"First time there last night and definitely will be back. Loved the service and friendliness of the staff. We were quite surprised when they brought over a couple tablets for the grandkids to play with while we waited for the food. Grandson didn't like the taste of the boneless wings he ordered so they made him plain ones instead and didn't charge us. Loved all the tv's having different games on. The food was very good, hard to select when it was our first time. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Waited forever for the order.  Got twenty wings (ten bone-in and ten boneless) with four different flavors. I have to say, that's the worse wings I have ever had in my entire life. None of the four flavors had any taste. You can't distinguish one from the other. The total we paid for just the wings were $30. I had better, more flavorful, and way cheaper wings with Domino's. Common' guys. That's just disappointing.  Will stick with wingstop from now on. So sorry that I dragged my friend to try this place. Won't return for sure."}
{"text":"This place is busy but yet the server still have time to come and tell you the specials and explain everything that's going on in the restaurant I thought that was pretty cool the happy hour menu is fabulous three bucks $$$$$ The bartender Is hooking it up! got to love her. I love some hot wings so this place is cool for dinner and drinks oh yeah cant Forget the games Macy and the buffalo wild wing team here in Scottsdale are an awesome group. Thank you all so much we had a blast."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Staff doesn't acknowledge you and if you try to get their attention, they'll give you an attitude. You bitches wanna make some money or nah?! I guess nottt"}
{"text":"Getting ID'd by a 20 year old when you're over 40 is just annoying. The drink special was 50 cents off regular price...not sure what's so special about that. Wings were good"}
{"text":"Big fan of BWW but this location has not been the best tried to call an order to go and got put on hold and forgot about three times. I understand its busy but this was just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Ordered food at 6:00 for pickup at 7:20 and food wasn't ready till 8 o'clock. Absolutely ridiculous, worst managed branch of B-Dubs I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with the guys.  Went tonight with the family.  The quality of all of the food is mediocre at best.  Wings are obviously the specialty - they were fine - however, not outstanding and over-priced.  I believe that I have been on half-priced Tuesday in the past and, at that price... it's about right.  My wife ordered Chicken Tenders and Shrimp - the tenders were about the quality you would get from the frozen food section at the grocery store... the shrimp, about the same.  And, for $13.99 - WAY over priced!  The kids meals small quantities and just okay.  Service was less than okay and the atmosphere was not great either.  Sorry to say... just not a good experience. :("}
{"text":"The restaurant is fine. Food was great, service was great. The incessant country music is AWFUL. Change it up."}
{"text":"Very dissapointed.  Thinking that this restaurant would be of the quality of the rest of the chain, I was extremely let down.   I don't know what the worst part of my dining experience was; the terrible service or obviously dirty setting.    Service was terribly slow.  It took at least 20 minutes to even get our orders taken.  While our sub-par appetizer came relatively quickly, our simple salads took FOREVER.  To make the situation worse, the place was no where near filled and there were employees simply standing around and talking.  There was no sense of urgency as evident by our 45 minute wait for salads. Our in and out dinner turned into an hour and twenty minute long waiting game once the check finally came.   The biggest reason I will never come back is the filth of the atmosphere.  Multiple tables were dirty and the floors were absolutely disgusting.  You could not turn your head without seeing wrappers or discarded food on the ground.  DO NOT COME HERE.  There are plenty of other restaurants in the area MUCH more fit for simple laid back dining than this one."}
{"text":"Wings were good nice and spicy but a little overcooked and they only gave us 6 napkins for a table of 6 people not enough if u eating wings.  Ordered couple beers and they were not that cold. Waitresses had nice attitudes though"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great atmosphere, great prices, excellent menu/selection. Service was top shelf as well. My boyfriend and I sat in the \"bar\" section. Lots of tvs so no awkward neck-turning. THE WINGS ARE (explicit) AMAZING. It was boneless night, 75 cents each. Their teriyaki sauce is BOMB. Lots of kick from ginger. Sweet BBQ and Hot BBQ both amazing as well. I HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was good and served quickly. The customer service was great. They have a nice collection of beer and the place was clean. I'll revisit this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live right around the corner from this place and for some reason we never come here. But tonight we decided to have our bi-monthly date night here.   We came in during the dinner time rush. The food was pretty good as always but the reason I'm writing this review is because our waitress, Samantha, was super awesome and provided us the best service we've had at a restaurant in a long time. I used to be a waitress and I can always tell when the wait staff if working their asses off. She was doing just that and still made time to keep checking up on us, talk to us for a bit about hockey (go Sharks!), making sure we were happy with our meals, bringing extra sauces and generally going above and beyond even though the restaurant was crazy busy. I always appreciate good service and she was definitely working hard to provide it, and made our experience here tonight great. We were both impressed and will be back more often."}
{"text":"I like this chain, but this location sucks. Food is average at best. The people are consistently rude or ignore you. One of the male staff sexually harassed my sister, being aggressive and commenting on her butt and chest. There were other staff around and they acted like it was normal. Had I been there with her I would have confronted the asshole and gotten the manager involved. If I ever get an itch for this chain I drive across town to another location.   If it were not for the reputation of the chain, this place would never get any traffic and close. Go to Boardwalk Billy's if you want some good wings in the area."}
{"text":"Food was good like most Buffalo Wild Wings chains. Restaurant was filthy especially for how new it is. Service was mediocre. It was a slow Tuesday night and it took a minute to get greeted. Ran by most 20-30 yr olds looking for a J.O.B. No real passion or care. Once we were seated we were told about there happy hour. After waiting maybe 10 minutes a gal came to let us know our server was \"pre-occupied\" but that she would get us started with something to drink. I have been to many Buffalo Wild Wings and know that chicken takes a while to cook however I don't think that time is the only factor to poor service of this franchise across the board. I'm starting to believe it is lack of training. Maybe coming from the corporates. Oh and the employee with the long pony tail and black glasses that wanted to belt out \"where the f*** is Robert. Ya that was a nice finishing touch."}
{"text":"Never, ever get a burger at BW3 - worst burger I have ever had in my life! Probably because you HAVE to have it well done, for $14 I would have been more satisfied with. $3 burger from DQ - also, make sure you confirm if you order boneless or regular wings because they will mess that up as well. Our server was very nice and handled stressful situations well; however, management at this location could use some work."}
{"text":"i need buffalo wild wings to move closer to home!!!  i live in Boston but my sister lives in Pittsburgh and bw3's (not sure why she calls it this) is one of the first stops when i go out there.  and i can be sure for Christmas and my birthday one of her gifts (and my favorite) is a 3 pk of sauces.  the food....the atmosphere....the service....i love it!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go, do not excuse the poor service given by employees. My husband and I stayed here last Monday, with the intention of having a good time, we hentered the place and everything seemed it would be a good night until we went to the bar, quickly attended to my husband was served a beer, I continue looking at the menu, my husband continued watching TV and drinking beer. I decided to order a drink, the girl asked for my id, and reuse to serve the drink because my ID was expired, I said, you want to know if I'm old enough there says I am 25 on my id . she answered, you can not be here, I understand she is doing her job, but why wait until this happened to ask my husband for his id"}
{"text":"The service is slower than usual at this location. Of course they are out of mac and cheese, so my kids were unhappy."}
{"text":"The boneless wings though tasty were all batter. I picked most of it off. The burger looks amazing and was huge. Could be a little more well lit during the day but the staff was wonderful and the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, they skipped our music we paid for and the manager lied about military discounts because I work for buffalo and we offer military along with their Blazin rewards. Our server slammed our waters down, no napkins, bad attitude. Very sad because I serve for Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"I really like BW3's. Lots of TVs and excellent seating. I had some of their boneless chicken wings. The chicken was ok, but I think they could have cut down on the breading. Service was good, nothing spectacular. Will go back on a wing night to see how well they do then."}
{"text":"WORST food and customer service ever! They started the bad experience as they took almost 30 minutes to get us the drinks, then almost 40 minutes to come with our food, and when they showed up with it, they messed up on my order. Then when I finally got my food, the Nachos chips were extremely salty and the meat had no flavor at all. The customer service was bad and I'm not saying the name of the server to not get her into trouble but they need to hire better people."}
{"text":"My family and I did not have a good experience here at this location. The one star is for the food. One of my family members had a drink spilled on them by the waitress, which we understand mistakes happen but the follow up was terrible we had to go get additional napkins from the restroom to clean up the mess in addition to her clothes being ruined by the Dr Pepper beverage. After that incident happened we waited for our food patiently and once we received our food one of our orders was missing, so we assumed that it was on the way, 15 minutes later we had to get the attention of our waitress to get our other order that was missing which took another 10min.  So we did not even eat our other order and just took it to go towards the end.  While we were eating our waitress never acknowledged us or asked how everything came out, all of our cups were empty and never asked to top them off. In fact we never saw the waiter until we were ready to leave and even then we had been waiting for a while and had to get her attention and asked for the check and boxes for the meals that we didn't eat. We also noticed the people behind us were also fed up on waiting on the waitress so they took it up themselves to get silverware and napkins from another table.  No manager or other employee ever gave us and explanation for the food being late and or apologized for the drink being spilled on my family member. By the end we were just fed up and ready to leave, I brought it up to the manager as we were leaving and he said that we are not the first to complain about the service and asked where we sat and that's about all he said.  Not and enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Wings were good (not better than others) Service was good except :::: Like the airlines they are nickle and dime you.  They ask :\"carrots or celery ranch or blue cheese\" . What they don\"t ask is you will pay for them.... $.60 each for 3 celery stocks and a small cup of dressing.  It add over $4.00 to our bill.  Sorry Buffalo, on to the next hunting grounds.   Did I add, too loud to talk."}
{"text":"BLUF, wings salty but .75 cents boneless wings Thursday can't go wrong. Santa Fe chicken was good, came with two tortillas which to me is pointless. Service was good especially for a party of 15 people."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Server forgot to put our order in. Came by after 30 minutes blaming the wait time on the big table, but we know she forgot to put the order in. 3 parties came in, ordered, and received their order before ours. We call the manager over (who clearly didn't want to tend to us by the look on his face) we asked how long the wait was going to be, he went to the back and NEVER came back out.   I understand 10000% that people make mistakes and that's fine, but as a customer, I would like to know what's going on with my food. If the server would've told us that she forgot to put the order in or the food was going to take a little bit longer, that's completely fine. But when you leave a table unattended and are not honest, then I have a problem with that."}
{"text":"This is my favourite stop when we are on the strip awesome service by Samuel their loaded ice cream is what I love THE MOST.. wings Thai curry n garlic spice are our favourite. Lots of TV with sports channel to keep you entertained"}
{"text":"This is my fave place for buffalo boneless wings, the food is good the service is mediocre, waiters always take too long to even bring drinks or take your order last visit the food made it to the table before the drinks tells you how long that took about 35 mins. The waiter seems went out of his way to avoid us it's def a hit or miss you never know how your experience will be since customer service is never consistent I will say I prefer female server. If they can get their customer service in check I would give them more stars"}
{"text":"The wings are always the highlight of my visit when I go here to eat. The selections on tv are very good and entertaining. Although it's a good food place it doesn't make for some visits with family. On a busy night it can get very loud, especially if there's a big event that night. However this is great for food and good times."}
{"text":"I come here time to time they have awesome chicken wings. I came in earlier today  and called ahead of time  and they said it takes 15 mins which is fine so when I got there  I was standing there good 5 min or so and this guy didn't even bother to ask if I need to place an order or even say hello so after 8 min  a lady helped me and went and check my order but she didn't come back  and I waited good 15 min again  and I ask this other lady if  my order is ready and she said she'll check  so total almost 25 min or more  before I got my order, when this customer order over the phone too and when he got there he got it right away..  When she gave my order I told her \" by the way your customer service is bad\" and she had attitude no apology for making me wait..  Overall the food is good but the people there needs skills dealing with customers seems HS students .  food is great  and find great workers  too"}
{"text":"After being blitzed with TV commercials about this chain, finally brought family. Huge disappointment. Worst nachos ever had. Skimpy on chips, hardly any cheese, and no real toppings on basic nachos. Even though wings their specialty, had better from home delivery options. Service was sketchy at best.  Worst is my 10 year old went to play one of the arcade games, which ate his money with no play. When he went up to the service area he was told that there was nothing wrong with the game and he should try again?! With more money?! He was upset, I followed up and he received quick refund. Should have been handled right first time."}
{"text":"This place us so filthy. The boneless chicken wings were tough and gross. The service was ok, but I just couldn't  get over how disgusting  this place was. The floor, tables and seats were so dirty. Makes me wonder what the kitchen really looks like. Who wants to eat in such a nasty mess?"}
{"text":"Food fine but the TV said wings were 60 cents and the girl said 65....when I asked about it I was told \"Oh that's  corporate.\" No that's false advertising according to weights and measures.....we sat at the bar and the bartender just seemed out of it.  No smile and she was slow....not being a boy seemed to affect us."}
{"text":"Meh....this place is okay. It's become way too Corporate America over the years in my opinion. Lots of competition out there now where the wings have a lot more meat on them."}
{"text":"Ordered off of postmates and of course BWW forgot the ranch, sweet BBQ, dry rub, and carrots!!   Leave it up the BWW to forget stuff!!!"}
{"text":"My family decided to go in for my birthday... We all came from different states and had four children under 5. From ordering to getting our dinner took an hour.. The waitress and management never came over and said one word. Finally I got up at the 50 minutes marker... And was told by manager that something broke in the kitchen.. And the kitchen was shut down... And our food would be out right away. All of sudden the kids had games to play with and the food showed up 10 minutes later. In between the waitress served a chocolate milk that was rancid... That was great one of the kids spit up chocolate milk on the table... I'm sorry at this point was not enough... Another manager show up and said, we will be talking 25% off your bill... Waiting an hour and being served rancid milk and no service.. Telling the paying customers what can we do... Well comp the whole bill... And we're sorry for the experience... Thats is the right answer... The food was just ok after an hour wait... And of course not one word about my birthday... Poor service and training on the company's part."}
{"text":"Plain and simple. The food suck badly everything was discusting, from appetizers to the beers. This is the third time this happens will never go back."}
{"text":"Great TV selection for football games. The wings were good but my wife and I disliked the burger and sides. Very nice staff though."}
{"text":"My experience was great. I work at a bank and once a month I get a weekday off so I can work a Saturday. Today I was off and it happened to be a daytime Pittsburgh Pirate baseball game. After getting my oil changed, at about 3:00 I met up with a friend at our usual sporting event location, buffalo wild wings. We had two GREAT bartenders. I want to say I do not know these bartenders personally but they have waited on me several times. We bought beers and food throughout the game. Overall, we spent about $120 together. My fiancée came to join us when she got out of work at about 5:30 and another couple joined us after they were out of work at about 6:00. At about 7:30 we were getting ready to leave. I asked the bartender for one more beer and my check. She informed me that I was \"cut off\" because the manager stated that I had been there \"since noon\". I was nothing but friendly and respectful the entire time I was there and I had not entered BWW until after 2:30. The manager that cut me off was Bobby. He claimed his \"associate\" said I was there too long. The bartender was very upset because she claimed that she did not feel I was intoxicated or causing a problem. She was also upset that this was happening to me when management does not cut off people who are obviously belligerent and are requested by bartenders to be cut off and their request is ignored. I am upset as a loyal buffalo wild wings customer. I am a frequent customer because I enjoy wings, beer, and sports. I will not go back to this franchise. I was a perfectly well-behaved paying customer tonight. I purchased over $40 in food and was in no way causing a problem. I am upset at the way I was treated. On my days off I like to watch sports and have a few drinks. I do not feel I was causing any sort of problem. My fiancée was there and would not have tolerated any inappropriate behavior from me. I believe this manager was wrong and needs corrected so that he does not have the same affect on other customers that he had on me. I also feel sorry for the bartender that she lost a tip because she was wonderful and she not have put up with actual belligerent customers that management refuses to address. I hope this shines some light on some issues at this location. I will not return to this particular location but my hopes are that your franchise can correct the manager issues and help out some awesome bartenders that you have working there.I gave a 5 for experience because my service was great but I am unbelievably disappointed in my experience. I have never been cut off at a bar and would have never expected that to happen to me at such a casual event."}
{"text":"As much as I'm not a fan of chains, I can't say anything bad about BWW.  The wings and selection of sauces is great.  They are always cooked appropriately and coated well in sauce.  The service has always been great, too!  If I had one criticism, it's that I wish they printed off a daily beer list.  Aside from the common drafts, the servers never seem to know what seasonal/craft beers are on tap."}
{"text":"Dining in is pretty straight-forward. If you order over-the-phone they usually only take 15-20 minutes to make your order and they're ready at the front. When it gets busy though, don't be surprised if you're placed on hold for upward of 10 minutes. The wing flavors are all really delicious, and so are appetizers. The staff is alight. In the years I've been coming here I haven't ever experienced truly terrible service, but I've experienced waiters forgetting orders, getting orders wrong, not checking on us enough, etc etc. Overall, if you come at the right time, the experience is really good. Sign up for rewards, you get free food! Also, they have wi-fi!"}
{"text":"Worst service at any Buffalo Wild Wings I have been to. I waited over 10 min before anyone came over to ask for drinks. We were worried the server wouldn't return so we ordered right away. We had to wave our server down to refill our drinks. When I finally received my food, the fries were barley warm, but the burger was good. Would not return to this location due to service."}
{"text":"we went few times for dinner we ordered BBQ chicken  wings and spicy wrap  it was great ! we love their food !"}
{"text":"The food is consistently excellent! The service is great and very friendly. The atmosphere is very warm."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to check out the newly renovated Kent Hotel in its new incarnation as BW's. Knowing what to expect from BW's I had no misconceptions regarding the food. The new location was what was going to set this place apart from the usual. It was a disappointment, the layout is like an obstacle course. When I did get to the bar I discovered it was really small. The projection screen located behind it, with the screens being washed in spot and flood lights, washing out the screens. So much for my plan of catching an inning or two of the Indians game, I couldn't elbow up to the bar. This place has some issue to work out. There is a second floor, I was hoping there was a bar up there too, like Ray's Place, but I asked and was told by the hostess it was just more seating.   I will return in a month or so and see what it's like when classes are back in session ,"}
{"text":"The service at this location is very slow. The food is great, but I hate going here for lunch during the work day because it takes way too long."}
{"text":"They ran out of boneless wings. So we asked them to substitute the boneless wings in the sampler with chicken tenders.  Manager, Brandon  said no......  We ended up staying, only because the kids were hungry. Otherwise, we were prepared to walk out..  Of course the food we did end up ordering tasted good. But we weren't happy with the experience."}
{"text":"Usually a fan of Buffalo Wild Wings, but ordered a to go order and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. Showed up 20 minutes later and the food was still not ready. Waited over 45 minutes at the restaurant for my to-go order. Funny how they made me pay first so obviously I tipped the girls and then had to wait 45 minutes for my food. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent adult beverages however service sucked and we would of ordered a lot more drinks but our Waitress was awful.  The waitress we had paid full attention to the men at the table only.  She should of realized that women ultimately decide if you go back and what your tip will be.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Over priced, small portioned crappy bar food with the slowest service in Ohio. Both this BW's and Akron's are horrible. ONLY go if you have some super coupon. It does fall victim to all the typical crappy chain restaurant faults.  The service is sad and bad, but the waitresses at least look good. Then again they're all KSU students so just about any other bar has the same.  If you are desperate and everything else is closed...and you have all night to wait for service. Yeah, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I just expect so much more in wings especially when the place is named after it. Can't really say anything about the food. Never impressed. The beer is cold and great for watching Football."}
{"text":"Was there several times for lunch but never really convinced. Today they saw me for the last time. I wanted the Jerk Chicken sandwich with the special sauce: \"Now stop snickering, it's really good\" says on the menu. But it was an awful mix of tastes (salty-cajun-cinnamon-bluechease) that collided in my mouth..I couldn't down it. They offered to replace it and I ordered another chicken sandwich which came very late (my buddy was done eating long ago) and I had a hard time to find the chicken (takes magnifier glasses to see it in the sandwich) and so I left hungry., grrrrh  In general the place is way overpriced for the food quality they offer. Even the beer is expensive and I assume the place lives from the people that work close buy and don't want to drive to far away."}
{"text":"I have been to this location at Metro Center several times. The bartenders have always been very attentive and friendly. So far up to this point I have not received bad service or food."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this \"Bdubz\". Took us 10 mins to even get asked if we would like a drink. Then we get moved to 3 different tables and were highly disrespected. Ordered food and it was thrown on the table and they walked away.  This is a place that I would expect to have avg customer service. There lucky I even paid the bill."}
{"text":"Bad service we walk in and were just sitting there they didnt even ask what we wanted to drink we tried reaching out to the waitress and manager and weren't even doing eye contact to try and help us. Left the place and no one bother to asked why. Bad customer service. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I go to this Buffalo Wild Wings with my buddy Chris every Tuesday around midnight. The graveyard waiter Cole is awesome! Dude always knows what we are gonna order! I love this place! BOGO Wings Tuesday and Thursday don't miss out!"}
{"text":"This is first review ever. I have to drive 25 mins to get here at least once a month just because my kids love asian style sweet spicy wings.  I don't like to write bad reviews but worst experienced in my life from our young gal crazy server at this place made me forced to sign in.  Major Management problems.  This place should not open for business.  PERIOD..."}
{"text":"I usually love BWW but I went in and it was the worst experience I've had in a long time. The chicken was over cooked and they skimped on the sauce. The manager even called the food terrible yet did nothing about it. I would recommend going, just not to this restaurant. We also received terrible service full of excuses."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times. The service is good. I enjoy the lunch deals. For the price, you get a lot.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Buffalo Wild Wings in Las Vegas. They have no problem bringing your bill but they have a problem with costumer request."}
{"text":"Man, I love this place! Admittedly, it took a few minutes to get us seated given that we required a high-chair. However, once seated the staff got our kids tablets to play with. That was the last time my kids made any noise. They were so glued to the tablets that dining out was stress free! The wait service was great! I'm planning on coming back again real soon!   My only complaint was the initial issues with seating, as well as a sampling of one of the sauces. It did not taste the same when I got my actual order (way spicier!). Aside from that, I plan on returning for another good time!"}
{"text":"Normally I go to the Westgate location, but decided to give this location a try given its proximity to my house. In hindsight, I wish I would have spent the extra 10-15 minutes and drove to Westgate.   Food-wise, the place is the same as the other locations. Wings are great! However, the waitstaff makes or breaks a place. This place's waitstaff fell below expectations. The only thing I was asked upon entering the place was, \"Have you been here before?\" I did not get any \"Hello\" or \"Hi.\" Rather, it seemed like I was bothering these girls. Again, the food was good, but the waitress just left me hanging pretty much the entire time. She'd appear here and there, but she really made any efforts to check on the table. It's one thing to see you walk by the table next to mine; it's another thing to have you actually ask me if there is anything I need.   All in all, I cut my stay and decided to go home and watch the game. For people that know me and how low maintenance and laid back that I am, it's pretty bad when I leave because of bad service. Do yourself a favor, hit the Westgate location or elsewhere. The waitstaff here have too many other things to worry about besides their customers."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night and expected a busy atmosphere but the overall experience fell far short of what we expect from BWW. We only had to wait five minutes to get seated but everything was delayed after that. Our server was great but we ordered the spinach artichoke dip and had to send it back because it was still ice cold. The second one we got was still cold but we just accepted it. We got 4 different kinds of wings and 2 of them were overcooked and extremely hard. Halfway through the meal, the speakers were turned up extremely loud to play ranchero music and although I'm usually a fan it's not what I expect from BWW. There was clearly an issue with the kitchen staff and the management leading to an ultimate breakdown in providing a quality experience. That location will have an endless stream of customers just from the stadium crowds alone but could easily be taken over by someone that knows what they're doing. A server shouldn't have to cover for the lack of effort with the other staff members. We love BWW but we won't be coming back to this location until management changes hands."}
{"text":"Came here on Thursday for lunch because they were having boneless wings for 75 cents. We arrived and were seated within minutes in our booth. The restaurant is a typical sports bar, nothing fancy or memorable.   The service had potential. Our server was extremely friendly, but unfortunately we found out she was not attentive at all. When we ordered our food, we had no plates and had to wait 10 minutes to flag her down. She was kind and when we needed something, she'll get... but it was quite exhausting catching the attention of our server. Drinks were also not replenished unless asked. It would of been nice if our server actually checked up on us. We were not checked on once.   The food on the other hand is decent. We ordered the sampler platter that can with tacos, quesadillas, and nachos which was pretty good. The wings are tasty as well, but not the best I had. We ordered the flavours hot, honey garlic, and blazing. Hot and honey garlic were my favourite.   Overall, not bad if you go on wing night since they have pretty good deals and their chicken wings are fairly decent. The service on the other hand needs quite a bit of touching up."}
{"text":"So this is the closest BWW to my house so I've been here several times,  if I'm not at the sports book, or Ale House.  The staff is friendly and the food is good and for the most part everything you would expect from a sports bar, I think that's why it only gets 3 stars, there is nothing that jumps out and makes it better than the other places.  Not to say I don't like the place, but there are several places I would rather go before I go here."}
{"text":"if I could give it zero I would  atmosphere: uninviting and cold Food: overpriced large order of wings for 18.99 SERVED IN A PAPER BASKET (for lack of a better word) why is my food.. food I put in my body presented to me in a paper type of basket????  unacceptable  wings were not edible. not even cooked all the way  we are in Phx and I cannot get the sound to the ASU game.. ARIZONA STATE, not ARKANSAS State until after an east cost game??? what give here  if you want a bad atmosphere, with no idea how to run a sports bar and really poorly prepared food.. go to this crap-hole!!!  I really think eating chicken not cooked all the way is dangerous to my health.. I did not eat it but I paid for it!!  oh, by the way, the TV's are everywhere... yea for B-dub as they market themselves...they will pay for a  500 dollar tv, but don't give a crap if they give you food poisoning!!  55\" tv about 500 TV mount from 69-89 dollars  my health and well being.. worth more than eating poorly prepared food!!"}
{"text":"My husband loves the food at BWW, but I cannot eat spicy food. Today I ordered a chicken caesar salad, and was dismayed to find red pepper flakes all over it-barely edible, and no notation on the menu about that. Don't plan a return trip anytime soon."}
{"text":"Though I really don't want to like national chains this is one that stands out. Not that it's super outstanding at anything because everything except cleaning could use a little improvement, but I leave smiling every visit. Why doesn't anyone rave about the spicy garlic sauce? I buy bottles of it to take home for my roasted vegetables and many other dishes (check the ingredients - J. Marzetti does not pump it with chemicals). What I'd like to applaud is the management & a surprise menu offering.  I recently spoke with servers, both on & off duty, who have been there for 3 years. This is a college campus location and they retain staff! No, they're not up to earning $300/evening in New York's foodie district, but they are loyal and they all stated that they can count on their manager. Therefore, their manager can count on them. My costs are reduced and investors' returns are improved by reducing training costs. Ask the president of SalesForce about his endorsement of appreciating the value of having a motivated staff! Now for the menu item. What on Earth is a campus wing joint doing offering pasta? Well, the \"Buffalo Mac & Cheese\" is spot on! I've worked for an Italian caterer so I understand al dente & the difference between spaghetti sauce and marinara. I grew up thinking that mac & chz was a baked entrée and BWW has taken this dish to an inconceivable level! Crispy broiled breadcrumbs top truly al dente pasta in an appropriate amount of wonderful cheese sauce and the tenders provide an unexpected texture and heat that certainly will make you sit back in your chair and say \"Wow\". Yeah, this place without trained chefs will do that to you. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place should just stick to beer and wings.  Both are great here with great service.  Nothing and I mean nothing else on the menu  is prepared well at all."}
{"text":"Expect to have to demand your change from the bartenders at this place. If it's for one drink you won't see the change for a five on a three dollar drink. If you order multiple drinks, the scam is for the bartender to ask if you want your change thus an attempt to shame you into asking for it. And I thought tip hustle was a casino issue. Management needs to put a stop to this."}
{"text":"The food was great. Boston Lager burger was awesome. Anthony was our server and he was incredible. Definitely will be going back"}
{"text":"The food was good. The fact that I could try the sauces before smothering my wings in them was awesome. The customer manager was a nice touch. The service was good. There is plenty of seating throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"service fast and efficient.  lots of drafts. staff friendly. bathrooms clean. food amazing.  thumbs up"}
{"text":"waited 2 HOURS to get sat down for a table for 6 people because the hostess' were playing \"favourites\" and letting friends go to the back and wait no time,would review a zero but you cant lol"}
{"text":"Each time I come here it's something else...waiting for an order for over 45 minutes...incorrect order (3 times!). Come on...let's get it together! You've been open for over 3 months! Geez..."}
{"text":"Tried the Buffalo Chicken Flat Bread, yum. then the Garlic infused Fried Mushrooms, breath not so great, but tummy and taste buds very happy"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, BW3 seems to be headed down.  While I didn't expect much, it was worse than that.  My salad had yucky brown lettuce and the boneless wings were meh at best."}
{"text":"I come here frequently and I was satisfied with all visits. However, the last 2 times I came, I received terrible service. It's a sports bar, so I asked politely if they could put a specific game on. I got eyes rolled at me and received terrible service after asking (even the manager was rude!). Don't get me wrong, I do love the food and the atmosphere here, but the service lately has been atrocious."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're in a rush. 30 minutes for a grilled piece of chicken? Had to take it back to staff meeting. Defeats the purpose of going to a restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food is great, if you have nothing else to do.  My wife and I arrived by 2:45 PM, and we were served wings, Caesar salad and a pulled pork sandwich nearly an hour later.  I'd hate to be here at rush hour."}
{"text":"Horrible! A group of 7 of us showed up after a football game. We all ordered, and after literally 25 minutes, 4 of the 7 items that came out were wrong. No offers of apology and then 30 minutes later 3 of the 4 items come out. No record of the 4ths lunch... At this point we wait 10 minutes for a beer to be poured that we have to ask for, and no refills of water.  We call over a manger and she offers our food free and says she'll get a round of drinks too. Bill comes, wings arent credited, which last I checked were food, and no free drink. We ask for her again and she said there was no problem with wings so those weren't credited, fine, and she can't actually credit is drinks, all she was going to do was \"rush our order of beer through\"  just poor management and service.    All in all, 2.5 hours later and our last friend finally finished eating.   Wasn't even a one of, last time a friend was there they screwed up the order too.    Never going back."}
{"text":"Some of the slowest service I've ever had. Nice server, who you'd think was totally in the weeds, yet the place was boringly quiet. I'll say half full.  When we came to pay, we did pay separately, I know, not something I normally recommend.  But then it took fifteen to twenty minutes to pay someone, anyone.  I'm not going to say its the worst service, or something like, \"I'll never be back.\"  Bit its not going to be a pick of mine.  Just try harder, actually, just try."}
{"text":"Food was terrible and always is, sadly my last visit. Took me and hour to locate my boneless wings under the pound of sauce that they were covered. Fries were good and hot, wings were maybe room temperature but I don't come for the fries."}
{"text":"I always love BWW. I had a great experience at this one. The waitress was friendly, on top of my order, let me watch the games and made sure my drink was full"}
{"text":"Always enjoy the wings, fries and beer! Great place."}
{"text":"Food sucked way not worth the price and the service was horrible. Waited an hour for our food!!! Not going back to that bdubs!"}
{"text":"First ever to BWW.  It wasn't very busy and we wanted to sit outside but people were smoking.  Yuck.  We sat inside and ordered mild wings and Parmesan garlic wings.  They were ok.  The carrots were just little pieces and not sticks.  Our server was nice.  No plates just little paper boats.  As we were leaving, several employees were sitting around playing the trivia game.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Right on the strip but without the Las Vegas strip price tag."}
{"text":"Wings are amazing!!!  Sauces are what make B-dubs the place to get quality, flavorful wings!  Generally good service, occasionally a little slow on thursday nights, but expected for boneless thursdays. Good atmosphere and of course, the best tasting wings compared to local competitors (i.e. quaker steak and lube, wing stop etc.)"}
{"text":"I am here to use the WiFi connection and hopefully to get some food.  The place is PACKED!  The football games are keeping the crowd in the store pumped up.  If you are looking for a quiet place to work this is NOT it...lol.  I was seated at a table near the register so I get a lot of foot traffic of servers.  It will be interesting to see if they can keep my drink refilled.  When I sat down my table was dirty.  It took a bit before my server was able to come back to me.  When she did I pointed out the dirty table.  She apologized and cleaned it.    I started off with an order of a side salad without the onion and tomato with dressing on the side.  My order came out quickly.  The salad looks ok but not overly fresh.  The lettuce in the  salad is a bit wilted.  The server was nice and said she would be back in a bit to give me time to start my salad.    I opened my silverware.  The silverware here has changed since I was last here (a long time ago).  It is thin and very cheap.  The silverware also had water spots on them.  Not bad but not appealing either.    I ordered Boneless Asia Zing wings.  They were good but a bit dry.  There were places on the wings that were not covered with sauce.  I later ordered mozzarella sticks.  They were ok.  I personally like them cooked darker so the cheese is nice and melted.  There was also not enough marrina sauce.  The little cup they brought out was only half full so the last two sticks of mozzarella were dry.    My waitress on the other hand was very pleasant.  She kept my drink refilled and was attentive without being a pest.  The best kind of waitress!  This is the first time I have every had my computer out writing a review as I was eating my meal.  The staff was nice in letting me plug my computer in but be warned.  There is internet access here but there are only one or two places where you could plug in your computer and work.  If you want to work I would suggest going North on Eastern and going to Starbucks.  Lots of plugs there and free internet but you will have to fight for a table.  The students from Touro Unviersity take that place over during the school year!"}
{"text":"Disaster from the word \"go\". When we got their several chairs and the table were dirty. The men's bathroom was not very clean, paper towels littered the floor. We waited what seemed like a long time for our main course. Horrible service, out of mozzarella cheese and food tasteless and cold. To top it off my son had a philly cheese steak and asked for a different sauce which we were charged $.60.  Will never, ever be back."}
{"text":"Bdubs, as many of you call it, or BWW is a great place to indulge yourself in for your typical Tuesday or Thursday Wing Night. You can't go wrong for 0.75/wing on Tuesday's bread night or Thursday's breaded boneless and with 23 flavours to choose from you can never go wrong!   Hey did you know every month there's a new flavour to try on your wings (or as a side sauce)?  Bdubs will always be my recommended number one go to for wing night, yes you can also go on other days but the best of the best customer service is always during their wing night when the staff are fast and efficient"}
{"text":"Very slow service with only a few customers. I had to question them about the bill twice because they basically charged me twice for everything. Go somewhere else the employees here are completely retarded."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Buffalo Wild Wings in years! Decided to go for Happy Hour last Sunday with a few former frat brothers and I was blown away.   They have since added to their flavor repertoire and I must say it is impressive.   Do not deny yourself some buffalo chips with cheese, whatever flavor wings you decide to order.   We hit the bar for a while after we ate and the service was great. All of the staff were pleasant, consistent, and clean (a must for me).  It wasn't too busy when we went although I've been told that it does get packed in there at times.   Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, took forever to get our food and the waitress never came back to ask if we needed refills or anything else. The food is overpriced and mediocre at best. Based on our experience we will never eat there again and especially not after seeing the sign that guns are not allowed."}
{"text":"I went a few weeks ago to meet girlfriends for drinks and dinner. The service was great to start but as we we're waiting for people our waitress stopped coming by. We could barely flag her down and then she passed us off to another waitress. The next waitress was better. The food was good for a chain. I had the naked tenders with Parmesan garlic.  Buffalo Wild Wings is what it is. It is an ok place to meet people and play trivia and drink. I only go to chains when other people choose them. I'd give it a 2.5 but since the second waitress was better and the food was pretty good I can give it a 3."}
{"text":"As a working mom of 4, I resort to take out at least 2 times per week.  This meal was very disappointing. It was relatively expensive for the quality of every single item we ordered.  This is essentially a McDonald's quality meal at TGIF prices."}
{"text":"I eat at B Dubs quite often but this experience just about ruined that for me.  My Husband and i came here last Saturday night around 9:30 it was still fairly busy since the fights were on but not crowded like usual. We were seated right away but once seated we were not greeted with a server we sat for about 15 -20 min, 5 employees walked by several times with no acknowledgement. Fed up we got up and left. The gentleman that seated us seen us leaving after we told him what happened he informed the manager who was nice enough to run out and catch us before we drove away and offered us $20 toward our meal,Tired and fed up my husband just ordered our food to go instead of sitting back down. But when we went back inside to order to go the waitress taking our order was rude...  When we got home and began eating out boneless wings 9 of them were nothing but breading...was not happy at all.... on top of that their new sauce we tried was awful. Tasted like week old tomato sauce with some pepper... HORRIBLE Customer Service  CRAPPY Food!!  Can say i will not be returning... ."}
{"text":"Service was great. Charlie and Alexis were awesome. Good and service were good. Great spot to hang out and watch the games. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"So I have been to this location 4 times now and have come to the conclusion that this is the only BWW that I will ever like. All the other locations have terrible service and the servers make you feel like an inconvenience but NOT this location. This location is always busy, which is not a big deal to me. The service I have experienced has always been great and the food (wings) is awesome! I will keep coming back with friends, great place to eat and have drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of BWW's and I have to say this was the worst.  I went with my husband and two kids at 3pm and there were about 6 tables sat in the entire restaurant.  The table next to us was covered with empty plates and cups the entire time we were there.  Not one staff member came to clean it.  Our server was nice.  We ordered mozz sticks and nachos to start.  The nachos were pretty gross.  My husbands first reaction was \"Wheres the cheese?\".  The lettuce was wilted and meat had no taste at all.  Mozz sticks were fine.  Next we all ordered wings.  They were over cooked, dry and just not good.  Not to mention the tap beers we ordered were warm!  By the time we were finished our table was covered in crap because again not one staff member cleared anything from our table.  I def wont be returning!"}
{"text":"I prefer this  Buffalo Wild Wings  location over the Fitchburg location as there tends to be less little kids having loud birthday party's here.  The buffalo ranch chicken wrap is always tasty as are the soft pretzels.  Good food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Friendly & informative staff.  Lots of T.V's with different sports to watch.  We had the fried pickle chips which are made in house. We found them super salty, I think they should reduce the salt in the batter and dip considering pickles are salty to begin with.  We also tried the traditional wings which are not frozen (the boneless ones are). We tried Blazin' it's the hottest sauce they have & we also tried honey BBQ. Blazin' is hot but not too hot to handle, both sauces were good! The veggies that accompany the wings were the freshest veggies I've ever had at a sports bar. Also, surprised to hear that they have 24 beers on tap!"}
{"text":"We wandered in because we thought this new location at the Norterra Shopping Center was open to the public, there were lots of cars and people going in and out. It turned out to be Friends and Family Day and this Buffalo Wild Wings wasn't officially opening until a few days later. We turned to leave but they told us to come on in and make ourselves at home which was a pleasant surprise.   There was alot of hustle and bustle going on and confusion (some friends and family can be pretty demanding) and I think some of the new servers were nervous but everyone was in a good mood, happy and the service was above and beyond what is usual at some places and quite efficient.   There was lots on the menu to choose from besides wings and the kids menu was extensive. We ordered a Black and Bleu burger, a grilled chicken sandwich, cheeseburger slammers, a Boca Burger, and of course, the wings.  There were so many wing sauces to choose from.and we decided to try the Caribbean Jerk sauce.   Everyone was satisfied with their food and we all tried each others (even me and I got the Boca Burger...I'm a can't-resist-the-temptation-of meat vegetarian). Often Boca burgers served at restaurants aren't very tasty even though they're all the same brand. I don't know what Buffalo Wild Wings does to theirs but it had a goof flavor and not that cardboard texture. The Black and Bleu burger had an interesting flavorful combination of bleu cheese and Cajun spices and the cheeseburger sliders were yummy. I've gotten in the habit at restaurants of testing out the burgers without all the condiments to see if the meat actually has a good taste. I've been so disappointed at several restaurants lately where the burgers are laden with extras but if you push those away and actually take a bite of the meat alone it's dull and flavorless. This is not the case at Buffalo Wild Wings, the beef is seasoned to perfection.   The chicken sandwich was juicy and had a good flavor. We really enjoyed the wings as well. I hate soggy wings and these were nice and crispy. The sauce was definitely tasty and not too sweet or spicy as some Jerk seasonings can be.  I was surprised that the french fries tasted just like McDonald's which is a good thing if you love them. I guess I was just expecting the fries to be different.   At the end of the meal we asked for the check and were told no check it was all on the house which was a pleasant and unexpected shock. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Thursday came and you know what that means! Boneless wings!!!!  We were serving and ready to devour a pound of wings each. The server comes to take our order. Some young dude who thinks he's way too cool, except for the fact that he's not. Whatever. I ignore it. Just give me mah beer and shot.   Drinks arrive. I'm happy.   Ten minutes pass. Where the fuck is Mr. Cool?  I want my wings!!!  Finally he decides to grace us with his presence and jokes. Takes our order. Go away now.   On to the wings. Delicious as usual. The vast array of sauces mixed with perfectly cooked wings. My only gripe? Why do I have to pay for ranch??? Whatevs. It's worth it!  Sidenote: This was the only sketchy experience I've had with a server here...hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered to go, was told 20 minutes. Got here a little after 20 minutes and still waited another 30 minutes on top of that. Many people also waiting were complaint about time and some walked out upset."}
{"text":"The beers tasted like cleaning product and the boneless wings were dry and chewy in the worst way"}
{"text":"So we had gotten there around 3am and it was a little busy so we sat down. We waited 20min and still after acknowledging we were there he still did not take our order or even ask what we wanted to drink. At 30 min I had asked if we could get some service he looked irritated and said just a minute. Now I would not be mad if we had to wait a little because it was a little busy but he was serving others that had arrived after us. He even helped the person behind us and turned his back as if he was ignoring us. After sitting for 45min and not even getting a drink order we left. The servers name was Keith. I will not be going back to this place."}
{"text":"got the beer and poutine combo. you can't choose the type of poutine so you're stuck with the original. which is fine but would be great if you could choose the other same priced ones. the beer seemed water down and the cheese from the poutine was terrible."}
{"text":"No stars Cuz of terrible service. My boyfriend ordered online and we paid with his credit card online.  Go to pick it up and they won't let me because I didn't have his ID...even though we were charged online for the order. I told him to make sure that the charge didn't go through and if it did I will be disputing it with out bank. They were so rude about their supposed \"policy\" even though I've been there multiple times and they've never had this policy until now. What a joke. Don't waste ur money and go to wingstop.  Better food and  better service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Good service and good food. Nicole was our server and kept drinks flowing. Never had to ask for a refill. The food was good, though slightly over priced. The decor of the restaurant was nice and featured wall decorations from local schools and city departments. I had the Mediterranean salad. It came with pita chips, chicken, blue cheese, olives, and other vegetables. The pita chips were great, as was the dressing. The menu said it came with hummus, although the there was no hummus. We also had boneless wings which were great. The other two people I was with also had salads and enjoyed them. We were able to stay and talk for over an hour and felt no pressure to rush. Nicole continued to bring us waters as we chatted."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time eating at this turd hole. Crappy service dry wings boneless wings had no sauce on them. Only positive is the tv's"}
{"text":"Food: Decent quantity and average quality. Wings were sauced well but could have been warmer. Perhaps they were sitting too long?   Service: Atrocious. The waitress had no clue what beers the store served (not everything on the menu was served) and no less than 3 times, provided incorrect information about their beer selections. (Aka - yes we have wood chuck cider, 5 min later - no we don't serve wood chuck cider\") Took forever to get our drinks. (15+ min for 5 of us) on a dead Monday evening. Food took forever too (30+ minute wait)   Environment: typical BWW's, fairly empty and appeared clean.   Overall I wouldn't recommend this location based on awful service, long wait times, and only average food at best."}
{"text":"We discovered that the one in University was closed down so we headed to this one.  It was our first time. The location and parking was not very convenient to start with. It was pretty dead for a Thursday evening.  They had about 15 staffs or more working with nothing to do.  Everyone was pretty much standing around. Our waiter was always rushing us on our orders. I guess because she wanted to get back to chit chatting in the back kitchen.  After we were done with our food, our waiter was nowhere in site for over 20 minutes or so. Two other  staff were chatting away so loud behind us like we didn't exist. At one point, one of the girls did take notice that we seem to be searching for our waiter, but did not offer to see if we needed anything.  She instead carried on her conversation with the other girl. We watched at least 10 staff including the manager walking around for at least 20 minutes or so before I finally told the waiter behind me if she could go find our waiter for us.   The wings also were not seasoned well and all mix in together. Needless to say,  we will probably not be going here anymore."}
{"text":"Went in to have a meal with my brother. Walked in and sat down in the bar where it was open seating. The manager and several staff walked by and never acknowledged our presence, nor offered to even grab a water or beverage for us. There was no service, if I could give a zero star rating I would. After 10 minutes of waiting we left and still we're not even acknowledged on our way out, or told to have a nice evening.  Will never return to this location again."}
{"text":"I am here at least once a week - rain or shine. I don't know if this is a good or a bad thing - probably good for my belly, bad for my heart.  I went to school in Buffalo and Wild Wings is the closest you are going to get to the authentic \"wings\" you can get in good ole' western NY.   They have a great atmosphere, great staff, and great food. Sports buffs can be found crowding both the bar and the dining area during games as there are screens galore throughout.   I honestly like this location better than the one on Hualapai & Flamingo, even though this location is slightly smaller.  If your new to \"B-dubs\", they even have a scale of how hot/spicy their different sauces are. And, if you're not in the mood for wings - they have other stuff on the menu too (from salads to burgers to a variety of appetizers).  Don't forget about the \"seasonings\" for the wings too. Essentially dry rubs, there's salt and vinegar, chipotle BBQ, buffalo, and desert heat.   And now I'm hungry. Good thing they're open 24 hours a day!"}
{"text":"Like the location on this venue. Plenty of tv's for the games and great place to enjoy some quality time..."}
{"text":"I called this Buffalo Wild Wings today at 3:05 PM, A girl answered, I told her that I wanted to place a take-out order and she said ok, that there was one person in front of me, and that she was going to put me on hold - which she did in the middle of me saying, \"ok thank you\"... then a girl gets back on the phone with me and say's it's going to be 25 minutes and I told her that it was ok, that I'd order from a different location, and thank you. She didn't say anything back to me, but she hung up on me before I could even say bye, she didn't say bye or anything - just hung up. She was pretty rude and a good example of poor customer service."}
{"text":"(my very first yelp review)... Took our 13u Club baseball team(Classic Baseball) there Friday night. We had a fundraiser going on. The wait was not too bad even being that is was during the world series. My table was in the middle, so we did get forgotten. The table next to us got sat after us, and got served food before we got our waiter. The sent someone over, I forgot her name, but she was very friendly, and cheerful, she made up for our wait on service. The food was good. my drink from the bar were perfect. All of the staff there got into our fundraiser, had fun with our raffle baskets, (even winning most of them). Which made me happy they were putting their own money in to help our boys! All of us parents had a great experience. and look forward to going there again!"}
{"text":"I thought it was pricey for the product. Service was slow and the server blamed the the bar staff? Many better chioces that are locally grown."}
{"text":"It was excellent service this time I came in. My waitress Alissa was very good! She was on top of things and constantly checking on us. My favorite waitress so far. Andrew was also very polite when he asked us to fill out papers. Great captain. I will definitely be coming more often."}
{"text":"I like the food at buffalo ww and our service had always been great. They serve coke zero which is a plus to me. They've let us sample sauces before ordering which leads me to trying new things although I always get naked wings with side salad. Surprisingly not too bad calorie wise.  The reason i don't go here more often is it is so loud. I understand its s sports bar so that's on me but it could come down a notch at least when its not a big game."}
{"text":"I am a big Buffalo wild wings fan. We tried this location for the first time and I will say it was just ok.  The wait for food was longer than any other visit at a buffalo wild wings location. It was not an overly busy night. In addition, the order was recorded incorrectly with multiple mistakes.  Service was subpar compared to other locations in my opinion."}
{"text":"Service isn't that great. The 3 times I've gone the waiter swipes my card for everyone else when my and friends got separate checks. There's too many young girls. They need more training. Very clueless waiters. Sorry. But I rather drive all the way to Tempe bww then go to Scottsdales even thou I live a few blocks away. Foods good. Just to eat there.NO!!!!"}
{"text":"Dear person who cooked fried pickles today at 1pm.  They were the best fried pickles ever  I love you."}
{"text":"Chain restaurant with a local sports bar feel.  Love the wings, great beer selections, and the staff are really cool.  Good for family, friends, or solo.  Great place to catch big sporting events or just a game."}
{"text":"I took my wife and son here and was very pleased. I was a bit concerned with it being a bar and grill about taking my son but was pleasantly surprised to find the despite the bar, the atmosphere was very appropriate for a child; they even had a kids menu.  The service was AMAZING.  Our waiter, (travis i think), was very helpful, polite, and most of all invisible unless our cups were empty or we needed something.  He didn't continually interrupt our conversation to ask if we needed something.  The food was even better than the service.  It may have been a bit pricey, but I would pay 11 bucks for the burger i ordered again.  The buffalo sauce is wonderful, the nachos are good, the onion rings tasted very fresh, and the burger i ate was the best burger i had ever eaten at a restaurant.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The worst service. Been here before and every time it is awful. No one cares about service. They ignore you and talk to each other. I only come back out of desperation. And always have awful service."}
{"text":"Was pretty disappointed... First time eating BWW chose take out. Food was dry , took an hour to get here(mind you I live 2 miles from this place) and they got my bf's order wrong.  Giving it two stars because I'll give it another shot hopefully the next time around it's better."}
{"text":"Sports Bar?  Nah, a Football bar, yes.  And thats American football at that.  poor excuse for a BW3, there are better ones just 30 minutes away in River!"}
{"text":"This will be the last time I ever eat at a BW3's. The quality of food has gone down, while the price has gone up. I paid over $70 for 2 adults and a 3 yr old. This is absolutely ridiculous. If this was a 4 Star establishment, then I wouldn't complain."}
{"text":"Food was better then the last time but still isn't great! Had better service this time, which is a positive! It is a place to drink and eat cheap bar food! However the bill was $40 for an early dinner for two, which is crazy considering the quality of the food! It is weird how the food at the same chain in Flagstaff is so much better."}
{"text":"OK so bufal wild winge attached to nascarhall of fam but didn't have NASCAR race on? Atalanta NASCAR race after Dontay 500 had to ask for TV to put on! Oh well Jim Johnson who cars but still! Get 4 tenders instead it comes with fries ands cheaper than the rest!"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????(??????10?????)?????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"So disappointed. The BWW that we normally go to is now closed, should have been this one. Tonight was the worst experience ever. Sat for over 10 minutes before being greeted, order was wrong and then they charged us for extra sauce when the wings were 50% covered in sauce. Many servers on duty standing around and not helping our server who claimed she had over 12 tables. I'm not one to post but am so disappointed of tonight's service and food. Don't plan on going back to that location."}
{"text":"The service was impeccable as was the food. We had a gluten allergy and it wasn't heard while ordering the days special. The order came and we couldn't have the one wings. They gave us the wings for free for the non gluten free persons and made us the proper wings. The manager, Jay, helped us and was especially helpful. I highly recommend eating at this location."}
{"text":"Morgan our server seemed miserable to be serving tables. She oh so happily took our order. Then showed up later to hand us a bill. Never check on our table after someone else brought us food or checked to see if we needed anything... wasn't busy to use that as excuse for shifty service"}
{"text":"I LOVE Buffalo Wild Wings (BWW). I believe there are two locations in the Charlotte area this one which is in the University area and the other one is located off of Sardis Rd close to Matthews.  I perfer the University area one compare to the other one. Even though this one draws in the college crowd. I love their chicken wings, my favorite flavors are asian zing and mango habnero.   I usually also get an order of their popcorn shrimp with the asian zing sauce. The rest of their menu is like many typical sports bar restaurant. Their drink menu is just okay. If you go on Tuesdays I think its .45 cent wings.  But only go here if you're looking to eat wings and watch sports!"}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday night and it was surprisingly empty, there were no good sports games being televised but it was surprising to see the place that empty. There are a lot of televisions so it is a great place to watch sports.  I ordered takeout, the food took about 12 minutes to prepare. What was surprising was the food was not that hot when I tasted it in the car. The wings and potato wedges seemed to be reheated. The wings were average due to the low temperature and wedges were little better because of the flavouring.  I will probably go back when I see the dining area busier in the hopes of getting a fresher meal.  At the moment I cannot recommend the place but this might change if I get a better experience next time."}
{"text":"Great selection of wing flavors; everything from plain to I can't believe this is so hot."}
{"text":"Honestly I've been here twice and received horrible service both times. As soon as I stepped in, I wanted to leave because of the very unfriendly welcome. Ordering the food was a hassle and not only did we have a long wait, but the food was completely cold. Our waiter seemed to be having a grand time ignoring us and talking to his co workers. Then when it came time to pay, my waiter decided to give me my cash, but keep the .81 cents from what I was supposed to get back. I assume he thought I wouldn't care. I hope enjoyed that tip. Never going back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good on to go orders, but I'm mostly writing this review cause of the good service. We had a problem with our order, and I spoke with Cassandra (server) and Craig (manager). Both were really helpful and took care of the issue right away. It's always nice when a chain restaurant treats their customers well. :)"}
{"text":"Food was great! Service a little above average. Fast and friendly. Only complaint is it's a little too loud to have a conversation."}
{"text":"While there are a ton of TV's to watch the game, they have a great beer list, and the service is okay, the food is simply not up to par.  For a restaurant with wings in the title, their wings are just, at best, average.  It's a great a great place to meet a crowd for the game and it is a decent place for kids, don't expect anything better than okay food."}
{"text":"Good wings. The atmoshere was friendly and they have a lot of TV's to watch games on."}
{"text":"I ate here for an early dinner with my daughter because she loves hot wings! We both ordered the medium size which is 15 wings apiece. I had a split order of Asian spicy and garlic Parmesan which were really good. My daughter loved hers as well. Very hot she said but again good. We also ordered 1 appetizer each chips and salsa and the garlic mushrooms. The chips were good according to my daughter ( I didn't try them) but I had the mushrooms and they were terrible, never again will I get them. The service was good and I tipped him well 18.5% but the floor under our booth was dirty with some straw wrappers and a lemon wedge. Yuk I hate messes but overall it was ok. The prices was pretty high the bill came out to be $45.43 before tip. That's 30 wings total, 2 appetizers and one soda and water.  I'll be back sooner or later."}
{"text":"Awesome wings! The best I had in any BWW. Parmesan Garlic and Hot wings are mouth watering!"}
{"text":"BW3, Buffalo Wild Wings and Weck, I recall the earlier names of this franchise. Seems with each name change, they've gone downhill. Chicken wings are bar food, and used to be free in many bars for drinking customers. Now they're quite expensive still mostly bone. Not only does Buffalo Wild Wings overcharge for average wings but the drinks are pricey, too, even for happy hour. Don't expect a nice, handcrafted cocktail here; it tastes like something from the 7-11  slushy machine only with LESS alcohol.   The waitress was nice, but brand new, so you can imagine some difficulties we ran into. The wing flavors themselves were the only bright spot on the menu.  Oh, while waiting for a long time we opted to play the trivia game on the greasy fingerprint laden tablets they loan customers. Twice I had to return it because of a dead battery.   Crowded, noisy, trashy bar atmosphere with average priced drinks, at best and mediocre wings (in relation to size, meatiness, overall quality), but, again sauce selection is above average."}
{"text":"We have been in this place a total of 3 times and I keep trying to give it a second chance every time because basically there are no other wing restaurants in Gastonia that I know of and my family & I like wings. First of all when we arrived the place was not crowded(a little after 5pm). Waitress took our drink orders right away. Brought the drinks and said she would be back shortly for our order; we were ready but she didn't ask. About 10 minutes later she came back and took our order. A little while later she came over and said it was going to be a while because 2 of their fryers had caught on fire earlier in the week and they had not received new ones yet. We were hungry so ordered chips & salsa to tied us over for the wait. When the wings did come out I asked about ranch dressing for dipping and was told on Tuesday nights that the dressing cost extra. Really you are a wing restaurant and you charge for ranch dressing ever is absurd. Anyway I was waiting for the dressing to eat my wings and finally brought it out after a wait(not sure how long, but we were waiting for it to eat). When she brought it out it was the bottled dressing-yuck!!. If they took the 10 minutes it would take to make homemade dressing then maybe they would not have to charge for it. Trust me it is better & cheaper. This is a wing place right? After finishing we waited yet again for our waitress to get a box and the check. Then waited again to pay!! I am normally very patient with waitresses as I was a waitress in college and I am a very good tipper, but our waitress lacked a lot to be desired. A little insight in the problem was she stood and talked with the table beside us for 15 minutes at one point."}
{"text":"not impressed and was hoping for more since its close to home with so many TV's..yey, but food has fell flat after a few tries. St. Louis has better bang for buck and flavorful wings."}
{"text":"We come to this place knowing in advance that our service isn't going to be the best even when it's slow. We have never wrote a review cause it was never so horrible that we had to. The food is good and affordable which is why we come back. However this time is by far the worst visit. So bad we asked for the check and a box before we were even finished eating. Forty five minutes later, she comes back and ask of we need anything with no box and no check, I am actually writing this now as we wait."}
{"text":"For the food they have to get 5 stars because I do love the wings.  For the gambling they get 1 star.  They have terrible comps.  You have to be playing max coins to get a free beer.  I guess that explains why whenever I go there no one is gambling.      Too much corporate culture there.  Will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of the food here.  I do like the traditional chicken wings and enjoy the variety of flavors to choose from.  Today was not a good experience.  I ordered the blue cheese sirloin wrap (new item).  The wrap tasted too salty and it was very small for the price- about $12.  I wouldn't recommend that to anyone.    The reason today for 2 stars was for the wait time.  It took too long to get our food.  I was getting so angry waiting.. I saw people who sat down 15 minutes after us get their orders first.  I was not happy at all.    Kids meals are a joke here. Portion size for a kids meal should read 2-5 years old.  Beware-  they are small.  The slider kids meal came with an over cooked hard little burger.  Not the best.  They need to step up their burgers.  I was not brave enough to complain but the food here isn't the best.  I would stick to chicken wings and maybe nachos.  Or-  go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Excellent place to watch football. Great food, good prices, great service."}
{"text":"We come to a BWW about once a week. Usually decent service and average quality food. This time we had decent service but we don't get silver wear unless we ask and our appetizer comes out different then ordered. Wait staff was friendly but when I asked for silver wear got a look like \"how dare I\" ask them for something. I don't love when you get multiple servers, it takes away the ambition for the server to earn his/her own tip."}
{"text":"So here I am to watch MMA as always.  It started off good with a new bartender. I was sitting are the bar. I ordered wings. So far so good. When the main card started I ordered a dbl bacon cheeseburger. 45 minutes later no food. Jokingly I stated to server SINCE IM NOT GETTING MY BURGER CAN I ORDER MORE WINGS. So I ordered split wild and BBQ. So the wild came out as garlic. My server took them back and as fast as she left she came back with the wild. All she did was put a wild label over the garlic label and poured wild sauce over the garlic and brought served them to me. I got the same non caring apology as when I didn't get my burger. I went and told the MOD whom I don't think gave a rats ass.  BWW you got problems at your restaurant!  Maybe corporate will give a rats ass."}
{"text":"The worse service!! We called to try and make a reservation because we had a party of 25 and they told us they don't do reservations. Well ok so we show up and wait around. The manager was rude and acted like he didn't want our business. When enough room freed up he tried to seat all of us in different parts of the restaurant. When we started moving tables by one another he he got all mad at us and told us we couldn't. When more people showed up to the almost empty  restaurant and took another table that would will the amount of people we had he told us we couldn't do that because they were reserved...but they don't take reservations we were told. Our order wasn't taken for about 20 mins till after we were seated just for our drinks and when we got the food it was cold. We have gone there before and haven't gotten good service but this was by far the worse and the manager was the worse of them all!"}
{"text":"Appetizer was awful. I'm reminded every time I go here that it was a mistake. Hoping writing a review will now remind me to never go back."}
{"text":"I think I may be addicted to this place. This location is a  bit out of my way, but after a terrible experience at the Superstition Springs Buffalo Wild Wings this became my go-to place. All of the servers are incredibly nice and efficient, and my order always comes exactly as I ordered. I've been here twice during the 2011 Stanley Cup finals and was happy that they had the sound on loud enough in the bar, but not too loud that you had to shout to the other people at the table. The food is consistently perfect, the atmosphere is great, and all of the employees I have encountered are friendly. The drink specials aren't too bad either. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"After shunning this place for over a year, I was dragged in by my family for my brother's birthday. Management must have read all the service complaints because it was a huge step up. Our waiter was great and I noticed the other servers were working fast and checking on other tables regularly. Hopefully it stays this way!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Ordered wing lunch. Took over 25 minutes to get. Waitress kept apologizing said they didn't have enough kitchen help. Well if you run a business get enough help. This is not a gourmet dinning. Wings were not good as well."}
{"text":"A really poor experience.  An almost empty place at 1 pm on a Monday should have been a clue.  Wait staff was slow, could not get orders correct, food took 25 minutes and then one of the dishes was inedible, which took another 15 minutes.  Do yourself a favor, skip this location of Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Love the food, BUT got here 45 min early to watch 1:25 steelers game and they had NO idea which TV it was on! Really?! Blue 32, Zipps, Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers always have the TV schedules done ahead of time!"}
{"text":"This location isnt cooperate owned, service was bad they sat us at our table it took ten minutes before we were visited by a server about drinks. The restaurant wasn t even that busy and our waitress was rude and impatient when asking about sauce selections. I asked for extra sides of ranch and they charge for every side even though its not tuesday or thursday. I also filled out a survey that gives $5 off and when i went to redem it at this location they said since they are not cooperate they only offer $4 off. On top of that they changed the wing prices to snack, small, medium, and large portions. Me and my son used to split 24 wings for $19.99 which is already alot but now the large portion is 21 wings for $19.99. While this isn t a big deal just feels like they make up there own rules."}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss but the wings are always good and happy hour has some good deals which makes it worth the trip. Tuesday's wings are 60 cents and Thursday's boneless wings are 60 cents, that alone keeps Ya coming back."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Never go this place. They probably will charge your card many times \"by mistake\".  Went there one night, and my card was charged for the correct amount. But the NEXT DAY, there was another charge appeared on the same card - for a different amount.   Called the manager, he said the waiter probably ran my card for the wrong table. But come on, how can the waiter ran my card the NEXT DAY, when I'm not in the restaurant?  Very shady."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, looking for some wings and a couple of beers and was not disappointed.  There's a long list of wing sauces and dry rubs, all of which can be tasted before deciding - a great touch, as it's sometimes hard to know how hot 'hot' is. We tried a few and picked 4 sauces for a large serving of wings, along with some fries on the side. Wings were 'naked' style and well-sauced.   Wait staff were attentive and cheerful (it was quiet, so we had pretty much undivided attention).  Lots of TVs around the place and they'll change channels as requested so that you can watch the sport you're most interested in.   All-in-all a good experience: not fancy, but tasty food and cold beer."}
{"text":"I wonder how long I will sit here before the bartender realizes I need another beer?! We are at 15 minutes now. Do they actually teach customer service anymore? Definitely the worst BWW I have been too. At least there are plenty of choices in LV, so I don't have to come back to this dumb."}
{"text":"I moved out in in January and it was still along the rives across from the trains. Kind of an old looking bar, but far from anything trashy. I enjoy going to watch the Penguins hockey games because I don't get them since I moved from home. They are able to get them at the bar and I usually have no problem with this. The staff is usually nice and helpful. I can understand it my be rough to get your drink order if you can't get the tender's attention when its packed.  My only qualm is with their move to next to Fraternity Row. Business plan that worked out, right?   Anyway, just go early enough so you can avoid the table of \"bros\" sitting next to you going into detail of his latest blowjob. Seriously, if these guys could use their storytelling talents when it comes to blowjobs.....then KSU would be pushing out Hemingway's and Oscar Wilde's in  record manor.  /rant"}
{"text":"Zero. 15 people in dinning room. Took half an hour for appetizers. Still waiting on the main course. N took 10 min to get a beer. Shouldn't half to wait an hour to get a burger. Never again."}
{"text":"Worst buffalo ever. The manager is a complete dick. On a college football Saturday in the middle of important games he turned all the tvs to a UFC fight and told us that it didn't matter what we were there to see that is what was going to be on. How can you run a restaurant with absolutely no customer service? we all walked out without paying, and I will never go back here or to any other Buffalo Wild Wings for that matter."}
{"text":"Service is HORRIBLE!! Waited at table for 15 min before i called manager over to tell him,.i watched employees shoot the breeze while i dat there,NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"I'm here right now and it smells like feet. This place could use a deep cleaning. Service was good though."}
{"text":"had a really good time her with this restraint I loved the food and the theme its adult and kid friendly some I would say come on down to buffalo wild wing and have a good time"}
{"text":"I like the chicken wings and the onion rings in hamburger. Haha."}
{"text":"I travel OH PA WV This is one of the best BW's for service I have been. Waitresses are awesome. Food is consistent and Marcy is the best! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'll make it short, service sucks at this location. Go to the one on Eastern or Sunset."}
{"text":"Food great. Service HORRIBLE!!!!! Be prepared to wait and wait for anybody to come by to acknowledge you."}
{"text":"I eat here fairly often during baseball season. The happy hour is a good deal, $3 tall beers and $3 appetizers. The wings are pretty tasty, but not as great as the name makes them out to be. Plenty of TV's to watch the games on. Service is quick, I've never waited long for a refill. The chili con queso is by far the best happy hour deal they have. I would stay away from the corn dog nuggets and the onion rings aren't very filling for the price."}
{"text":"I was working in the area and came across Cardello's. I had the Chicago style. It was awesome. The sauce complimented the cheese and the crust was real Chicago style. Not a dine in but delivery and pick up. Nice people and great service. I went back. No regrets."}
{"text":"Went to this location on a Tuesday. Very busy as it was Traditional Tuesday so half price wings. Unfortunately it seemed like the wings were also half size. Do they save all their small bits for Tuesday's? I've been to many BWW in my travels and have never been disappointed in the size of the wings until now."}
{"text":"my gf and i are avid bww patrons, i'd say every weekend we partake, however lately we've been experiencing a lot of problems with their pick-up / carry-out service which we often place orders through.  fairly recently we've been having issues with them getting the order right.  typically they forget utensils, missing orders of celery and / or ranch, give us the wrong flavor, etc - but the line was drawn for us when we placed a 24pc wing order only to see that there were 12 wings in a 24pc box and the other half of the order was not included after coming home, relaxing in front of the tv and getting ready to eat.  never had we really experienced a problem with dining in (with the exception of the occasional lag of service when it's a little crowded) but all of these mistakes with carry-out has started to rub us the wrong way.  when picking up an order, always always ALWAYS double-check right in front of them."}
{"text":"This is way overpriced, poor quality food! Gamey chicken....four lousy pieces with limp, lame fries for over $10. Yay for mediocrity! They blast all their stupid TVs so you'll be distracted from what your tasting. One plus...and they do deserve credit for this: the sauces ARE interesting and tasty."}
{"text":"good service. i never had to ask for a refill for my drink, she kept them coming! (that is what i really like in a waitress, one you don't have to keep asking for refills).  the food there is good overall. definitely a place i will come back too."}
{"text":"Your service sucks. Second time here after a trip to Zip City never again. Waiting an hour for food is unacceptable, especially st dinner time."}
{"text":"There was a bit of a mix up in my order. I had ordered 15 hot wings and only received 10 (but was charged for 15). I called up and told them about the mishap, saying I would arrive in person to correct the order.   When I arrived, the gentleman at the takeout station remembered what I had called about and immediately got a manager. When the manager, Scott, came to talk to me, he asked if I would like the wings. I said that would be fine and had a wonderful conversation with the takeout server.   When Scott came back out, he had the entire original order: 15 hot wings, wet, with carrots and ranch. I was absolutely amazed! I had expected just 5 hot wings! Exemplary customer service that went above and beyond my expectations!"}
{"text":"I wish I could comment on the food, but since we were never even waited on, I will just speak to the service.  Today,  my family and I wanted to take my uncle to eat before a movie.  He had just had major foot surgery and needed to eat before taking medication.   When we walked in, we were greeted fairly quickly by the hostess. However she was very difficult to communicate with as we could not hear her or understand her. She mumbled something and said it would be a few minutes. Confused by the low occupancy of the restaurant,  we had a seat in the waiting area. 5 minutes later we watched that same hostess enter the dining room and vacuum ice cubes for the next 10 minutes while 3 parties were seated in front of us. After dry vacuuming a handful of ice cubes and leaving many others, she went back into the kitchen without acknowledging us. 5 minutes later after 2 more parties seated in front of us, we confronted her and another hostess about the situation.  They exchanged some words between the two and then the other girl took us to the dirty table with the ice cubes everywhere. We sat for about ten more minutes without being greated. We looked at the time and decided we were going to miss our movie unless we left. So we walked out,  starving and all. There were no apologies, and no acknowledgment of our leaving. We will never return again. The hostess situation there is unfathomable and a great reminder for everyone to go to college."}
{"text":"I went to Buffalo Wild Wings when it first opened and I thought that all of the hick-ups I experienced while there were only because it was new. But now going back almost a year later - things still have not changed.   Friends and I were craving some pub food and we figured that this place was a natural choice. It may have been because it was in the afternoon (around 5) that there seemed to be an abundance of staff while there were hardly any people in the place. Even when working in a restaurant when there are no one there to fill the seats you should still look busy or be doing something. But we counted 6 staff members standing, talking, and just looking bored. With that many extra staff with nothing to do, it does not send a great message.   We started with soft pretzels and deep fried pickles, and right from the start the food was super salty. Granted pretzels should be but the batter on the pickles don't need that much seasoning.   I thought wings would be the saving grace, but those too were very salty. We tried Mild which were too hot for some, and then Parmesan Garlic which I pictured to be dry but was saucy - and again very salty. Considering it is a \"wing joint\" most pubs have more and better tasting flavours than here.   Since there were only 2 other tables in the place when we first arrived the server seemed always on top of us, and not in a good way. We were still enjoying drinks and talking and she kept coming back to ask for payment. She kept walking and stopping with the debit machine. It felt like she was rushing us out.   While in LA I was surprised to see so many Buffalo Wild Wings establishments but maybe it is better there than here?!  Either way this will be my last trip there."}
{"text":"Check your to go order before you leave. They have several people back there doing nothing and no common sense. So frustrating you can't rely on people to do their job."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Placed an order online for pick up and they messed up my order. I wasn't given what I ordered and I was still missing items . Manager only suggested $5 food credit lol. Did he really think I'd go back and eat at this location after I tasted the wings they gave me? Wing sauces was not true to its flavor or the flavor of other BWWs I've visited. I will not be returning nor ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"This review is for Dylan, the day shift bartender. Not only did he provide exceptional service for me and my mom, this guy starts identifying regulars coming into the bar on a first name basis, even recognizing a couple's drink orders as soon as they walked in. Despite the fact he forgot to give me and her trivia devices when I asked for them the first time, this guy apologized like he should have and came off as sincere when making conversation; the best kind of customer service. We will be back."}
{"text":"I always go back to this bdubs because they always are nice and never mess up anything. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible, you basically end up having to fish out your server and these wings are so expensive but there's BARELY any sauce on them! My wings need to be COATED  if I'm spending $25+ for 5 bare chicken wings.."}
{"text":"We came in as a 5 person group at 545, we didnt get seated till 630. There were multiple groups of people, some with more than 6, seated before us. This is Arizona in the summer and they offered to seat us outside, in the sun, with no air conditioning. Terrible service"}
{"text":"Food is always Amazing!! Service is almost always gGreat with friendly staff!  We went last night to eat we had a party of 8 and after being seated we were greeted with one of the Rudest waitress's ever...the service Lauren gave to our table was horrible from the minute she walked up to the minute we walked out.  Please request a different server to make sure you have the BEST experience ever!!"}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed with a place. I wish I talked to the manager. So after work I went with my boyfriend since it was my birthday. When we got there it was busy like usually we waited since we had four of my friends.   When we finally got a table we ordered. We waited for our food. My friends and boyfriend finally got their food but they forgot my order and made me wait for twenty minutes. My friends were annoyed because our waiter took forever.  After that my friends asked the waiter if they can sing me happy birthday but they said they couldn't since a football game was on. But after five minutes later they sang happy birthday for another person. I'm never going back in there"}
{"text":"Jessica is the best bartender.  Always a great time. Keep up the great work. Will tell everyone i know to come here on Tuesday night to see her."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get wings. It has a sports theme and is perfect for family or get together with friends. It has a wide variety of flavors and huge menu. You can watch sporting events, or play games of the tables tablet. I plan to come back here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday with the family. Service was super slow. Got our orders wrong. Got wings and they didn't give us any napkins. It's the little things that make a restaurant. Overall book such a great experience. Never coming back. Go to tailgators people. Way better establishment."}
{"text":"Went there for cheese curds and beers and ended up trying the new hickory smoked wing. Give them a try they are excellent. Hopefully they will make on the menu."}
{"text":"If you are willing to wait for more than an hour to get 10-piece chicken wings, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, waited 2 hours for our food..they kept saying it's coming out in 2 mins and when it came out it was cold. No refills on drinks... I Will never go back..if I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours!!!! Great happy hour from 10pm-6am!!!! Huge selection of beers on tap!!! Great friendly staff!!!!"}
{"text":"For a restaurant just opening Im impressed on the speed of service also the energy of the bar staff. I had a great time and enjoy the atmosphere will be goin back regularly. Oh and the outside patio was a great addition"}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by stating that I have visited a lot of Buffalo Wild Wings locations in many different states, and if I were reviewing this location strictly in comparison to other Buffalo Wild Wings locations, it would have only one star; however, the two star rating is in comparison with other sports bars.   My visit was on a big rival NFL game day. I was surprised to find there was no wait. The booths were the most uncomfortable I've sat in, being that they are completely wood, but whatever - I was there for the game (and lunch). Two or three of the screens were not working, one switched to a blue screen literally every five seconds, and several of the others were blurry or distorted due to a dying projector bulb or some other malfunction. Our waitress, Sarah, was nice, although she did seem more interested in primarily her male customers, even sitting with a group of guys for a bit, making it difficult to get her attention.  The orders were extremely slow coming out, especially for the restaurant not being completely packed - 25-30 minutes for a small order of wings? No apology or explanation for the wait. The food itself was pretty standard Buffalo Wild Wings, nothing amazing but no complaints either.  The culmination of poor maintenance of the screens/projectors, uncomfortable seating, and unexplainable wait for food is really what made this a pretty disappointing visit, particularly from what I have come to expect from Buffalo a Wild Wings. Next time in the area, I will definitely be choosing another location or a different sports bar altogether to watch a big sporting event."}
{"text":"Lemme just say, this is a great place for wings and sports, possibly one of the best combinations I know of. I ordered the Fried Pickles for appetizer, Honey BBQ Boneless wings, and Nachos and Salsa for the table to share. I would recommend the Fried Pickles. Let's just say it's not what you expect it to be, it's very delicious. This is my first time here, so I have no say on the Traditional Wings; But the boneless? Great! They're more like mini chicken fingers when you think about it, but they're wing-sized. The Nachos and Salsa are great. The Nachos come out warm, and the Salsa tastes authentic. As for the sports? Plenty of flat-screen TVs with different sports on almost every one of them. Bar looks great, also. I highly recommend this place, it's the best place to hang out with pals and watch sports, yet a great place to enjoy a family meal. This restaurant definitely gets my 5-star seal of approval."}
{"text":"I have never been impressed with there food. The service is hit or miss.  The last time I was here the waiter did not take away our plates and we had put them on the floor"}
{"text":"Got takeout, wings were ok but the nacho burger was pretty bad.   Looked like something you would get at McDonalds, frozen and tasteless.  I will probably not go back."}
{"text":"7 of us went here for a friend's birthday tonight and had possibly my worst-ever dining experience. We arrived at 5:30, well before any would-be crowds, ordered, and then SAT THERE FOR OVER AN HOUR before they finally brought our food. We had kids in the group who were really hungry by that time. There were many empty tables around us, but a huge line at the door; I'm not sure why they weren't seating people. Anyway, when the food did arrive, it was cold and not good...for example, the wings with barbeque sauce had sat out so long all the sauce had been absorbed. The fries were old and cold.   Our waitress did her best, and I don't blame her for the kitchen's shortcomings. When she came back after our food was served, she asked how it was and we were polite but honest. She asked if we'd like to talk to a manager, and we said yes. She came back minutes later to tell us it would be a while before the manager would get to us because in her exact words, \"Surprise, there are several others waiting to talk to the manager as well...\"  The place is very very loud, with far too many TVs, but I'd expect that from a sports bar (and sports bars aren't my kind of thing, so I'm not using these facts as any basis toward this 2-star review).  I'm giving it one extra star because the manager that we spoke to apologized and told us the meal was on him. Problem was, we did not come here for a free meal. We came for food we had heard was good. This was a very disappointing birthday for our friend."}
{"text":"By far the best BWW in the valley! Great location and the staff is extremely efficient and friendly. I've been a consistent customer here sporadically over a 7 year period, and have never left unhappy. The bartender that's been there during that period is Immaculate at his job extremely knowledgeable, just ask him to surprise you with a drink/shot....you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We literally waited 10 mins to even get a menu. There were plenty of waiters wandering around that kept walking by us and making eye contact and were ignoring us. Once we were acknowledged by the waiter that was in charge of this area, he came off with an attitude. We came on a Monday afternoon, so this place wasn't as busy. They gave us the wrong order and when we finally were able to track our waiter, which we asked another waiter to call him over, he literally rolled his eyes at us! WORST experience! I am never coming back to this location! Best location is on Peoria!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite wings place, but the service is top notch.  We always sit at the bar and they have the best bartenders in town.  They are always friendly, remember my wife and I, remember what we like to drink and even make fun of me because I order the same thing every time."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. Waiting so long for our food here. It seems complicated orders are parties of 3 or more people. Horrible service.  About an hour wait.  Why did we stay? There was nothing else open nearby and we were tired."}
{"text":"We ordered five things and three of them they were out of. The food server set an order of wedges down on our table and after we started eating them then our waiter said they were for another table and took them away to another table. We asked to speak to the manager but they were too busy watching the game. They said they were out of hot sauce for wings even though they sell it in bottles off the shelf.  They should have given me a free order of wings and I would go buy a bottle of hot sauce to pour on it. For being such a big chain, it is pretty pathetic that they can't order enough supplies for game day.  I will never go back here. These morons should not be allowed to operate a chain if they cannot use a computer to plan ahead."}
{"text":"The service was ok.. Food was good for w sports bar.. It was slow coming out though considering it was very slow when we all walked in. Took some time to get the check as well but sometimes that's a good thing. It's a good place to go watch games.. Oh they need to turn down music... Very loud music for a sports bar.."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar.. Server was good and cute.. Food was greasy but done well. They did mess up on the fried pickles but fixed it  I would recommend this place as a sports bar"}
{"text":"Not too bad of a place to watch games but don't expect too great of service especially when busy. The food is so so and they will charge you for extra sauces so use them wisely. Other then that it's a good sports bar to go to"}
{"text":"Sadly I will never eat at Buffalo Wild Wings ever again... I used to eat there a lot but the past 4 times they can't follow directions. Good thing I'm not allergic to the things I ask for them to leave off! I asked for No Tomato, there's a sticker that says \"No Tomato\" and there's tomato all over this salad :-( last time we came. We arrived 10 minutes before happy hour was over and sat for 10 minutes. The server that was standing at the computer watching us while chatting with another server, came over at 7:01 and said \"I hope you didn't want any happy hour items, because it's over.\" And took the Happy Hour paper off of our table. I thought I could go to another Buffalo Wild Wings and be treated better. Unfortunately I don't think I'll ever find one."}
{"text":"BBWs is THE BEST! This location has it's ups and downs, but i ALWAYS enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Has to be the worst experience I've ever had at wild wings, so to start out we decided to sit outside on the patio, 3 times later the host finally said inside or on the patio REALLY ?? So I walked out and sat myself, well not only are we on the patio and being the furthest table from the kitchen and on top of it I need to go inside to get condiments, the server tells me oh no big deal your my only table, so appetizer comes out, followed by 1/2 the order, now mind you we have been waiting for like 20-30 minutes for food the manager comes out to say we're out of shrimp really that is unexceptionable, we could've gone anywhere here and chose wild wings, and to top things off they're not even busy"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and the food is pretty good, my boyfriend loves it and I don't mind it either. The service is decent not horrible but not amazing either. I prefer this location because it is not jam packed and seems like more of a family place and is not so loud that you can't hear each other talk. I would definitely go again, probably when they are running their wing special on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment!   First... I'm not a beer/sports nut, so big downside there. I was impressed by their beer selection & prices seemed very reasonable.  The wings... you call yourself a wing place and serve up this slop??? It tasted like a bag of wings from the freezer section at Fry's!  Yea, the sauces have an ok variety, but it mostly seems to boost up the male testosterone by how hot you can order.  No presentation of food, mediocre service, uninspiring corporate wings... all in all, my impression was some corporate accountant put these places together... not a foodie.  VERY limited bar if you don't go for beer."}
{"text":"Worst service ever - Waitress told me I could not place an order since she was so unorganized. Waited 1/2 hour for her to come back to place an order."}
{"text":"Okay spot for late night eats. Everything closes at 10pm in northern Scottsdale, thus Buffalo Wild Wings is only decent sit down option. Food is not much to rave about, but the environment is a good (sports bar with lots of tv screens)."}
{"text":"Overpriced and got rid of the BOGO on the traditional wings on Tuesdays. Wtf. Lack of customer service, vet corporatized. Ordered a large  traditional wing order and got one little container of sauce but 5 containers of ranch???!!"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good.  Cheese curds were a great choice to start with.  All the staff was very friendly from the moment we arrived to the moment we left."}
{"text":"We went here a couple of months ago and it was horrible. We ordered chips and salsa and it was like they some ketchup in a bowl with some other stuff. It was disgusting. The hamburger did not taste good either.  It was made wrong and the waitress was absolutely horrible. Will never go back again"}
{"text":"A-OK.  I have actually never been much of a fan of BWW, but inevitably, I'll find myself in one at some point or another.  How come?  Well, like children from across the ages (pun intended), I can still succumb to peer pressure when grossly outnumbered.  In my personal opinion all previous BWWs have only amounted to maybe a 2-star experience.  This specific one earns a whole other star thanks to the awesome waitress, and the experience she facilitated single-handedly.  I have yet to think the food at any BWW is more than just meh; I just expect a little more for the price.  I guess the experience justifies the mark-up for some.  Here is no different in that aspect.  I think it goes without saying that if you didn't like something, they do offer quite a selection in order to at least get it to be passable.  Now for the awesomeness.  As per usual, I was experiencing the dilemma of which sauce to pick.  I at least make it a point to try something new along with something I know I'll like -- just in case.  Well our lovely waitress noticed my indecision and offered our table to try them all.  Disbelief and excitement must have prevented me from immediately jumping all over that idea.  She took that moment to explain that what BWW employees usually do to become familiar with all the sauces.  I finally managed the motor skills required to nod my head vigorously, and off she went.  I didn't know what to expect at this point as we haven't even ordered anything beyond our drinks; had I, we probably should have ordered a basket of plain fries for the endeavor.  What she returned with was a large tray full of small, individually labeled containers with a dollop of the appropriate sauce in each.  I'm in heaven at this point, just using my designated pinky finger to try each and every single one.  The rest of my group tries a choice few, but no, I must try them all.  Here are my few take-aways:  Buffalo is a sauce, not a seasoning, and their attempt at this twist failed miserably, horribly, etc.  Salt & vinegar is as good on a wing as it is on a chip.  What the hell is the point of Mild?  Parmesan Garlic succeeds in getting those flavors not to overpower each other.  I would put Chipotle BBQ and especially Desert Heat on something else too [e.g. fries or ribs] if you know what's a good idea.  Where's the garlic in Spicy Garlic?  Jammin Jalapeno and Caribbean Jerk could use a little more refinement in getting that flavor right.  Thai Curry has surprisingly no false advertising in its name.  Mango Habanero sneaks up on ya.  Both Wild and Blazin are just heat without much flavor.  Everything else wasn't noteworthy; therefore neither horrible nor any good.  This sort of thing is what I live for.  Unfortunately, what little interest BWW had from me is now satisfied, and I see even less in returning to one.  Oh yeah, we ordered food after this endeavor, and I couldn't care enough to remember what I even thought about it.  What did it for me was this one awesome waitress and her experiment.  Why I didn't hit on her is beyond me, but that's another story.  If I ever absolutely, positively had to go to another BWW, this would be the one, but I'm okay if I never do."}
{"text":"I came here with the family the day after Thanksgiving to watch some football. We ordered some boneless wings that were pretty good and Miller Lites that were on special for $3. The bartender/server seemed pretty annoyed to be working and wasn't very attentive, even though the place was empty. After we finished the wings we ordered some more food. This food was bad, a few burgers and some sort of soft taco plate. Nothing was good.  The televisions are very outdated as well, no HD, flat screens, plasmas, or LCDs. Just small 20 inchers and some very large projection screens. The video quality was very poor, the projection screens were very washed out, to where you could barely view. The small TVs didn't have a clear picture. I would think if you advertise so much as being a sports bar as they do, the TVs would be up-to-date. I was really disappointed in this place, I love hot wings and beer, I thought it would be a good spot."}
{"text":"not sure what has happened  here but the service has went south, at least this eveving. I have been waiting 10 plus minutes to get my gaming payout and my check. I'm now sitting right across from the register that is flashing my payout and no one is seeing this but me. oh wow now nearly 15 minutes later someone noticed. I have been coming here for years and service was really good, now it's more consistently on the bad side. I really loved this place at once but find it hard to come dine at the bar and receive  good service and I am not a picky guy. Once I did receive my payout I thought  I'd get a portion of my drinks comped just as my buddy sitting next to me did for playing, but nope I was charged the entire bill. I normally cash out so I can give a decent tip, but not this time. This bww is close to my house so want this to be a good place to hang out at and get good service. managers please get the store back to the way it was. I remember coming to the bar and the bartenders knew exactly what I was drinking and I saw the same with other customers. i showed the mamager my post and he offered me some free wings and I declined because all I want is good service not free food. I guess PTS is going to get my business if things don't change."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time we had ever been to a Buffalo Wild Wings and  we were pleasantly surprised. When we first walked in I was put off a little by the music. As another reviewer wrote about this location I will agree it is really loud. The greeters at the front are very warm and nice. Our server was extremely helpful and friendly. Since we had never been in before he took the time to point out everything on the menu and recommended a few of his favorites. My fiance, mother-in-law to be and I shared an appetizer of wings. We had the mild sauce on half and hot bbq on the other. The wings were BOMB! Then we had our meals. They said their burgers were to die for, and the onion rings were delicious as well. As for my build your own chicken sandwich, it was ok. I should have ordered a burger, but all in all we had an awesome experience. Music- a little too loud, food- friggin fantastic, service- damn good, atmosphere- typical sports bar. We will return again! :)"}
{"text":"Food is from a frozen bag. Beer specials good!"}
{"text":"First off George Michael and Carrie Fisher died and then Debbie Reynolds died, so my day was already bad, I showed up to Buffalo Wild Wings to cheer me up. I showed up with 3 of my associates and the service was fairly decent but after we ordered our drinks their drinks came out and my drink never came out, my drink came out an entire 60 seconds later. Absolutely ridiculous!!!!!!! Are you kidding me?!?!?!?!? I am never returning to this establishment. EVER!!!"}
{"text":"I always have a great experience here. I usually come in between classes at csn. The staff is always nice and friendly they keep the drinks comin and if the food comes out lookin like it has been sitting out for 3 days they take it back and no questions asked! The food is the standard BWW food but the service is what makes this location great."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this locaton since it was right up the street from my house but they either have changed the mgr or the cooks something! it just doesnt taste the same at all and they dont seem to coat the wings well bonless wings like wing stop.  I hate to say it but will not order wings from here for awhile til i actually hear good things and see a change."}
{"text":"Food is always great, but this location has hit an all time low. The Manager, Tony, is awful. There was a bat In the restaurant and he was nowhere to be found. There were kids crying and people screaming, and a customer finally got the bat out the door. We also had food that was wrong; we had food that never came. They comped a part of our bill, but he never came out to our table to apologize. The server was great, but he needs training in customer service. Actually, I never saw him the 2 hours we were there. When he finally came out at our request, he did not apologize. He even said that bats \"come out at dusk\"...an excuse that just made a bad experience worse. His staff seems to like him, but as a customer (fairly regular) I was appalled. I will not be back to this location for sure...good thing Madison has other options."}
{"text":"Ordered a pickup of traditional hot buffalo wings and french fries. I've had better wings they were okay not that great. French fries were great though."}
{"text":"I've been here three times over the past few years, and every experience has left me a little disappointed. On the most recent trip, I ordered boneless wings and fries. It was prime dinner time on a Saturday. Luckily, there was no wait. I was surprised that my fries were cold and dry. The wings also did not stay warm for very long."}
{"text":"The service by the bartender was good. I wasn't blown away by anyone's personality, but the service was proactive. Where I had serious issues was when a customer sat next to my friend and me. He professed to be a gang member, then tried to start a fight with my friend. My friend and I had no desire to fight anyone, and I thought the appropriate measure would be to inform management of what was going on so they could remove the individual starting a fight in their establishment. However, the guy starting the fight was a regular customer, and management decided he could stay because he said he would stop. I was beside myself. This guy had threatened to assault my friend and was allowed to stay. I wasn't okay with continuing to sit next to this guy. I told them that they need to ask him to leave. As they refused, I became irate and berated the manager for allowing this to happen. Because I was speaking loudly, we were asked to leave instead. This was over a month ago, and I'm still livid about the situation. The bottom line is that if one attends this establishment regularly, it's okay to threaten other customers. If you speak out about being threatened, you'll get thrown out."}
{"text":"Had a Great Lakes Ocktoberfest from the tap.  The beer smelled and tasted terrible.  Cleanliness of their taps are an issue here.  Food quality was typical of a chain restaurant.  Wings were hot; potatoes wedges were cold.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Having eaten at a Buffalo Wild Wings in Philadelphia, I just assumed that the quality would be the same here in Arizona. The food in Philly was pretty good for a sports themed restaurant. Unfortunately, it is not nearly as good here in Scottsdale. My wife and I decided to stop in and watch the World Cup and have lunch. The quality of the television picture was good the food not so much. We ordered the Ultimate Nachos with chicken and an order of fries. The server asked if we wanted the one pound or three pound basket of fries. I said one pound is more than enough. Again, you just can't assume things. The food came and the fries were in a small cardboard tray. If they were a pound, I am going to be the next King of England. Now on to the nachos. The chicken which there wasn't much of was small colorless tasteless pieces sparsely spread on top of the chips. The chips had some cheese on top and very little to none on the chips toward the bottom of the dish. There was no chili to be found. After a taste or two each we sent the nachos back. We asked for our check as we didn't feel like doing any further sampling of this location's menu. We came, we sampled, we won't be back."}
{"text":"BWW has always been one of my favorite places but this visit was a bust. The drinks came out quick but then it took forever to get our order taken. Then the onion rings came they were very good hot and fresh however when the wings got there they were barely room temp. After we ate we were going to have a couple drinks but the waiter brought the check before we were done eating! Oh well we will go have drinks were we are wanted. Granted we did get a good portion of the bill comped so I will give them another chance but this visit is a 2 at best"}
{"text":"Should have gone to a place that I know is consistent(will write a separate review for that place). Sat for 20 minutes without even a nod from a server. They all looked confused. Had a table of six so one work of think \" cha ching!\" but after begging to have someone take an order the manager had to come over to tell us the beer we ordered just ran out (What???? Thursday at 5?? Poor planning maybe?). Anyway got our food which included ONE ranch for 20 wings. Asked for more and after most of the wings were gone several cups of ranch showed up. Could have kept eating but we couldn't get refills on water or tea and heaven forbid we get a second beer.  Pretty pathetic restaurant management. By the way it wasn't just our table. Table next to us was just as unhappy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The late night service is gret and the wings are just as good."}
{"text":"The staff here is super, super, super unprofessional.  I honestly don't even know why 99% of the staff have not been fired yet.  If you're the manager reading this, here's my 2 cents. HIRE A NEW STAFF. Read what the community and public is writing on YOUR restaurant. Take pride and fire those lazy workers. They are useless and an embarrassment. SO LAZY.     My boyfriend and I walked in and nobody even acknowledged us. It took about 4-5 minutes for the talking hostess to stop talking to other employees to even say anything to us and the worse part?, she was standing right in front of the hostess stand.   So at this point I'm already super annoyed!  We told them we were going to have 6 people altogether so they sat us outside. After getting a phone call that two people were no longer joining us, we went inside to ask them if we could get a table inside for a 4 top now. They had no idea what the word \"Top\" meant. If you're going to be working at a restaurant, please learn some restaurant terminology!!!!!! So after giving me blank stares, I kindly say ...\"We no longer have 2 people coming in, may we have a seat inside for 4 people?\" and the guy looks at the other 5 talking hostesses and says \"Uh, I thought you said you wanted 6 people??\". Like.... what the hell?? I am literally telling you that two people are no longer coming, don't come back at me and say that to me. I, the customer, am telling you, the server, what I want. Don't say \"I thought ..\" like, that is super unprofessional.  And to top it all off, my wings were super dry and old. I've worked in a kitchen for the past couple of years so I DEFINITELY  know they're old so please, don't tell me they weren't old! Plus, it was Football Sunday so I KNOW the fryer guy had extra wings just sitting in a bowl waiting to be coated with whatever sauces he needed. Like, I get that it's going to be super busy for Football Sunday, but you never know who you're going to serve. Like, ew.  HORRIBLE STAFF, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE. I hope everyone gets fired."}
{"text":"Walked in about 5, had to be at work at 6:15 so I wanted something quick. Walked in was greeted by the hostess very polite. Went straight to the bar because it was empty and I wanted to watch ESPN. However I did more of watching tv than anything else. After sitting for about 8 minutes me and my girlfriend received zero attention from the bartender. We sat for the first few minutes and waited because I saw that he was counting cash, me being a bartender as well I thought he's counting his bank cool. However I usually look around HE DID NOT, not even give me a \" Hey I'll be right with you.\" So after he finished he then walked over to a lady who had literally just sat right in front on him. He asked her if she wanted anything she said no. He then walked over poured himself a soda and looked Directly At ME !!! Still nothing. I'm pretty patient, however when you continue to get ignored and don't even get a \" Hey I'm sorry, what can I get you.\" I've walked out before from this place but heard that they had redone the inside and tried to get more of the locals back. Yea it actually looked really cool inside now, but the bartender on this shift May 29 to be exact was horrible."}
{"text":"The service is up there with the worst i have ever had. Walked out after 2 hours of waiting with paying my full bill for the 3 drinks we were served in 2 hours. Went to noodles across parking lot and got on our way. Manager was no help bad attitude to go along with it."}
{"text":"Acey was incredible, was very welcoming and kept the energy flowing in a great way. This is someone that adds to the experience and brings value to the restaurant. People like her is why loyalty exist in restaurants!"}
{"text":"Waitresses are awesome.  Waiters....not so much. One guy we have had wasn't very friendly, didn't get our drinks for almost 30min. I come here often and every single time it takes wayyyyyy to long to get our food.  Especially when there are maybe 4 other tables with people at them, it would be understandable if they were packed.  Waitress service is always excellent ontop of drinks and all that. Food takes way too long so if you're starving might wanna pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends. Wings were small and served on paper cartons to save on dish washing? Needless to say, they messed up presentation probably the only way you could with wings. Service was mediocre and the seating arrangement was annoying and leads to a loud environment, which can be fun but combined with the bad food just made me want to leave. Never went back, don't plan on it either."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!! I decided to visit the local Buffalo Wild Wings while here in North Las Vegas visiting my daughter. The wings were less than desirable. A portion were missing their sauce/flavor that I requested and the others were just too hard to eat. When I called to speak with a manager a man came on the phone, questioned me ask if I was lying and then said hold on let me pull up your order but never came back on the phone."}
{"text":"Excellent wings. Will definitely come back. We took 10 Boneless & Double portion wings. We picked 6 flavours in total: lemon/pepper + asian + mild + cajun bbq + honey bbq + garlic parmesan. They were all delicious! Highly recommend to try all the flavours. This was my first time at Buffalo Wild Wings and I was pleasantly surprised. Great food & great service. Two thumbs UP!"}
{"text":"Came for a quick lunch and had the best time! Food and drinks were perfect, as was the company...Blake was entertaining and attentive, definitely loves his job ;) Thanks, Blake, for such a great experience!"}
{"text":"I walked in to the female manager reprmanding the clealy new host in front of customers. ALL THE SERVERS SEEM MISERABLE HERE.   Nacho chips are stale and gross Oven is BROKEN and everything I want needs the oven :( Buffalo wrap had good flavor but the chicken was so over fried and hard I hurt my tooth!  French fries were good Black cherry limeade was good BUT 3.19 no refill  Oh hahaha and they switch the TV to Jeopardy in the middle of a game WTF?"}
{"text":"So glad that this location decided to start showing UFC pay-per-view then suddenly stop featuring it with no notice.  Standing at the Warrensville BW3 entrance, confronted with adverse conditions of their inconsistent policies, I told the manager I was scratching them off my list and went up to the BW3 on Mayfield and was so happy there:  UFC, friendly staff, good beers on tap.  Thanks for unintentionally directing me to a much better-run BW3!"}
{"text":"Bdubz's happy hour was the saddest part of my day. This location has a minimal selection of \"specials\". You're better off buying frozen appetizers from the grocery store than spending $3 on their extremely small and unappealing starters. The parmesan garlic boneless wings I ordered looked like they were thrown into a pan of somebody else's leftover sauce, so I might as well have just been eating popcorn chicken. Again, I'd be better off buying my own frozen food. At least if I made my own appetizers and wings, they would be served hot.  The service here was just as terrible as the food. Four different servers came by my table, and I swear that not one of them smiled or even attempted to be friendly. They took forever to get anything done, and they were unapologetic about it. My table didn't have many requests, but the servers either forgot or ignored them. It wasn't busy at all, so I've just come to the conclusion that they suck."}
{"text":"Went if for lunch and ordered the buffalo ranch sandwich grilled and a snack size of wings (curry flavored).  This place is what it is, a wing and bar food joint!  The wings were good as was the sandwich despite it coming out fried.  Great place for bar food and wings!"}
{"text":"We took a break from the strip and had a nice, relaxing meal at Buffalo Wild Wings the food was good, the service was good the experience was good."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the service was terrible. Cassandra was extremely rude to me. After I received my bill I let her know I ordered a snack and not a small. She grabbed my plate without asking and pointed out that I received a small. I again, told her that I ordered a snack and she said that's why I read the order back to you. I told her I am such a loyal customer, I come here at least once a week and I always order a snack. She cut me off and said okay so you want me to take it off, and I said yes. She stormed off and when she came back she said, do you still want these to go, I said yes, and she slammed the ticket on the table. She walked away and started arguing with her co- worker right in front of our table as if I didn't know she was talking about our table. I am not looking for anything out of this just a place where I can go to enjoy some amazing wings. I am such a loyal customer, please look me up!!! It's very hard for me to go somewhere where I do not feel comfortable."}
{"text":"The wings are ok....mango habenero and jammin jalapeno are amoung my favs...service can be on point some days and then some days not so much   J.R. is def my favorite and most out going and personable server this location has..."}
{"text":"Sat the bar and received very good service from Bethany and she also had very good recommendations on items on the menu. She was very knowledgeable and friendly. Next time I'm in surprise I'll definitely stop back there and grab the jammin jalapeno hot wings extra crispy. I am a hot wing connoisseur and I won hot wings competition... Don't get me wrong there wings are good but they don't compare to Wingstop. The flavor on the jammin jalapeno was actually extremely satisfying like I said I just wish they had been a little bit more crispy"}
{"text":"I used to like Buffalo Wild Wings until I went there this past weekend and was served wings that were not fully cooked and spent the following day throwing up and in the bathroom constantly from food poisoning."}
{"text":"usually have good experiences here but today i went and my boneless chicken was purple and brown inside very disgusting. i told the waiter and he brought me back ONE new boneless wing and walked away. horrible horrible horrible. i will never come back."}
{"text":"I love to come here for chicken wings it's the best place for me can get enough of those mild Buffalo sauce wings. The best thing of all thought is the potato wedges ugh they are amazing this place is also really clean and sanitary really nice people"}
{"text":"I am amazed to see such negative comments.  I have eaten there a few times.  Since I go there for wings that is all I can review but I have never had a bad wing served to me.  I found the servers to be friendly and I really like the idea of letting you sample the sauces.  The manager came to the table and asked how the food was as well as my service.  I have nothing negative to say about this place."}
{"text":"This place smells horrible. I've never walked into a place and walked right back out. If you're looking for a somewhere to lose your appetite, this is it. Can't comment on service, didn't make it that far. Enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"Saturday night around 6:30, nearly full restaurant...had appetizers and entrees. Everything came out on time and well prepared. The kitchen made a couple of minor errors but our waitress corrected them quickly.  Great service!  Will definitely go back in the near future!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time coming to this location and they have screwed my order up all 3 times. They also charge me for ranch every time. No wonder this location is never busy."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few BWW's in the midwest; this was my first time to one out here in Vegas. When I walked in, I've never seen one an unattractive as this one. Basically a dark, crowded boring room. That's part of the reason I'm giving it one star, but the main reason is our server. He was friendly and upbeat, however he spilled an ENTIRE Pepsi on me-- It got me head to toe, not joking. It was in my hair, on my face, on my arm, jeans and even in my shoes. It tipped over on his tray and right into me. And as I'm sure anyone knows, when that stuff dries, it's sticky! So the rest of the day wasn't my best.   He felt terrible, apologized profusely and was clearly embarrassed, so I wasn't upset with him- I told him it was an accident. We were all even joking about it to make him comfortable. I'm surprised, however, that when it came time to order my food, he told me if I wanted anything other than french fries with my wrap, there would be an upcharge. REALLY? I'm eating lunch sitting on a towel because you spilled a drink on me and you're going to charge me an upcharge??? When our bill came, he only comped the drinks, which surprised us all. I'm not the type of person to ask for free things, so we just didn't tip him as well as we would have if he did what we felt would be the right thing and give a percent discount or comp my lunch. He was a nice guy so it's just sad that he left that kind of impression on us with how gracious I was about the whole thing."}
{"text":"My family of 5, as well as multiple other families were waiting for, what we were told would be, 30-45minutes. We patiently waited as it was a playoff night for NBA and many large tables were being held by 1-2 people for their party to show up. Fine. It's a big night for NBA playoffs.   The manager assured we'd be sat soon despite the rush. A waitress also came over and let us know they were cleaning off the booth for us, a family of 5 that was willing to squeeze in. As we are watching them clean the table, two young gentleman walk in, who expressed sitting in the bar. As they were walking towards the bar area, \"Kassondra\" greeted the gentleman, as if it were common occurrence, as they walked by and she proceeded to ask how many was with their group. The kid responded with \"2\" and she goes \"okay, let me see what I can do\". She struts over to the booth they were cleaning for us and she starts to clean it as all the other waitresses turn and look and ask what she is doing. She claims that she's giving the booth to the other two gentleman who just walked in. The waitress who told us that they were getting it ready fought her case and said it was for us. Kassondra shrugged her shoulders and said she is giving it to the two young kids that just walked in.  The waitress turned around rolled her eyes and had to be the one to explain to the other hostess and manager what Kassondra was doing as they all looked confused as to why.  This was so ridiculous that we just left as the manager claims these two kids were just waiting outside, which is a blatant lie considering the conversation I just heard between all of them. Not only is it ridiculous how unorganized this place has become over the last year, but then the manager treats his customers like they're stupid, even when the customers were standing 2 feet away from the conversation with all the facts.   What an embarrassment for Buffalo Wild Wings, and what a embarrassment for Chandler Mall. This will be the 2nd or 3rd bad review I've had to leave for this Buffalo Wild Wings specifically and I've been to plenty all over the country. Save your time and effort. Marjeles, Zipps, Teakwoods. Any other place really. This will be the last go for my family and friends at this Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"This is the worst Buffalo Wild Wings location in the area. 2 stars isn't even fair. 90% of the employees there are very rude. They're not welcoming at all. Especially the ones who are at the cashier counter, they will turn their backs and laugh at you if you ask a question. I normally dine in and rarely take out. Don't even bother taking out if you're going to get multiple items because they tend to most of the time mess up on your orders. Also when they hand you your food, it's like they're throwing it at you. Dinning in is great because they serve you hot wings for sure, but the only bad things are the waitresses. They're really rude. They spend more time standing talking to other servers there than really doing their job. If you ask them a question because you're curious about an item on the menu, they will literally laugh at you in your face. If you have an issue, the manager is always willing to help, that's the great part about this place. However, it would be nice if the employees would do their job right and not laugh at your face or (not literally) throw food at you. I came here to pay for my food, not beg for it."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER. I've came to this location twice and the same thing happened both times. I've been seated very quickly, but once seated, servers avoid you and do not acknowledge you whatsoever. The first time I went there, got to the point of getting only two drinks out of 5 people. Second time, we sat there for forty minutes without being asked if we wanted anything to drink. It wasn't even that busy. The servers would look right at us and walk right pass us! So annoying. Walked out both times. Please save yourself a trip."}
{"text":"I Love the B-Dubs just not this one. There service is a little slow. There wasn't a big game going on and hardly anyone there so i was expecting the service to be faster than normal. The wings at this location seemed less than satisfactory and too small. maybe its because i went for boneless instead of my usual traditional wings. They also have U of A stuff not appealing when you're in ASU territory. I don't mind seeing a small pendent in the back but its not the first one i want to see when i sit down."}
{"text":"My son picked Buffalo Wild Wings last minute 6pm on Saturday to have his birthday dinner with his baseball team (we were in town for a tournament ).  We didn't know how many friends to expect but there ended up being about 30 of us. Our server Britny was super! She tried so hard to keep us together and accommodate everyone even though they kept trickling in over a time. She was very friendly and helpful, great with kids and catered to us all so nicely. She was able to remember what kids went with who and was accurate with all the orders and bills! Thanks Britny for making it possible to celebrate my son's  birthday with his buddies- it was special! And thanks for making it fun for the parents and grandparents! It was a great night and we will be back! Food and drinks were excellent too!"}
{"text":"I went to this location with a friend after church we basically wanted a place to hang out. we weren't going to spend much money; it was late we would probably even split a meal. It was a  mad house, with an hour wait, when we got there on a Tuesday night due to TMobile Tuesday's Free wings! (which we had planned on using as well.   The crowed was much younger than us lol we just wanted to sit down and hang out. feeling frustrated and overwhelmed we approached the manager for help. The manager, Jarrod personally cleaned a table off for us we were seated in about 10 minutes. Our server Amanda took great care of us even knowing we weren't ordering much. We had a nice evening and when we went to get up and leave Jarrod met us at our table asked how our dinner was and was very sweet he walked us all the way to the front doors. We had a great visit, even though it may be busy and there is open seating just ask for help, the serve is great!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Friendliest staff, great managers, and great food.   I see many regulars at who are very nice. Will def keep coming back."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place.  It is a chain and it is consistent.  The wings were good - and plenty of them -  the price is reasonable and the service was good.  If you are looking for wings - this is the place!"}
{"text":"Smoking is allowed in the patio. Eating here cost me an extra $20 since I have to take in my dry-clean-only jacket to the dry cleaner. Wow. 2016 and smoking is still allowed. Crazy."}
{"text":"We eat at BW3's on occasion. I like the food but my only issue is it seems no mater what I order everything starts to taste the same. I assume it has to do with the oil they are frying it in has a very distinct \"twang\" to it. I like it ok, but just cannot eat here too often or I'd get burned out quickly."}
{"text":"I had heard many good things about Buffalo Wild Wings so decided to try it out. We visited the Chandler Mall location. The service was bad. None of the staff had smiles on their faces. Even the manager looked miserable. The service we received was terrible. You would think that at a place that mainly sells chicken wings (a rather messy food), would have napkins readily available, maybe already on the table in a bucket or something. Not just the ONE that the silverware is wrapped in. But we had to stop our server and ASK for more napkins, which i found absurd. I won't be coming back. At least not to this location ever again."}
{"text":"It was overpriced and gross I will never go again. Didn't even finish my food half way none of us did. Our drinks were hot like literally hot my burger smelled and the bread was hard as a rock!!!!!  and their wings were dry she didn't bring the dip for the fried pickles until we were done with them. I was still starving when I left. We all were. wingstop is better and even the fried zucchini from Carl's Jr was better then their pickles. Very disappointed in the quality of the food and drinks."}
{"text":"I come here very frequently with my family since we live in the area. Service is spotty at best. Plan on spending and hour here to get drinks and food. Not someplace to come to if you're in a hurry or have a schedule.   They did a major facelift on this place. Looks much nicer, however, while I appreciate putting lipstick on this particular hog, I hope the service is better."}
{"text":"I went in, had to wait 15 minute to be seated (on a Tuesday night). They seat my son, wife, and I beat a very LOUD table. The food was amazing, \"10/10 Mac n cheese\" - my son. The wings were fire!!! This is when it all goes bad, when I told the waitress that it was my son's birthday she said \"cool\" then walked away, there was no singing. If you want good food I would highly recommend this place, but not for a birthday dinner.  Food 10/10  Service 8/10 Birthday 0/10"}
{"text":"My favorite BWW location!!! I always order Well wings, and extra wet.  I have been to other BWW, and this is the only location that gives you what you ask for! The cooks are always on point! Whether you dine in or order food to go, it is always perfect."}
{"text":"I guess I should have read the reviews first. Service sucked. Sat down and waited 20+ min and was not even greeted by a server. The girl that seated us walked by multiple times and didn't care that no one was taking care of us. Walked up to the manager and asked him, \"are you the manager?\" He replied, \"I could be why?\" I told him we just waited 20+ min and got no service so we were leaving. He said sorry and seemed like our complaint was putting him out. If you want Buffalo Wild Wings drive 5 more min to one that will be happy for the opportunity for your patronage."}
{"text":"If no stars was an option they would get none. I can eat just about anything and not complain. The food here is disgusting. The boneless wings tastes like a freezer burnt bag of chicken was dumped into a deep fryer from a grocery store! They need to seriously revamp their menu. This place makes Zipps looks like a 5 star restaurant avoid at all costs unless you're a hood rat of course then Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! I just moved out to East Mesa and will miss it. The wings and service are great. Back when I lived in Cleveland we called it BW3'S BABY!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience, ask  for Julia... best server I've had in a long long time."}
{"text":"Continued from my last review. I just want to add that was just one person at this establishment. The only reason why my girlfriend and I continue to come is for the GEC Donte. He is great at what he does, he's funny, communicative, and really makes coming here a fun experience. Hence the 5 stars. I would give him more if that was an option. So I suggest if you've had a bad experience give this location another try and hope he is here and you won't be disappointed at all."}
{"text":"There is two things I love in life, beer and sports (but don't tell my wife that LOL). Buffalo Wild Wings or as my grandkids call it \"B-Dubs\" is a perfect combo of what matters most to me (again don't tell my family). I went in there with some old college buds to watch some football and get some beers and I was impressed. It was football sunday so it was busy as expected but the service was great and the food and beer was what I needed after a hard week or work (just kidding i'm retired) but still great place!"}
{"text":"Came by tonight after the horrific night I had last time, decided to sit in the dining room where \"Josh\" was serving. He did a great job checking in on us and making sure we had everything perfect. I gladly appreciate his help tonight. Got some juicy wings and celery and carrots with ranch, also got refills without asking. Josh is a well mannered waiter and provoded excellent service. Props to JOSH! Me and my fiancé enjoyed our wings and came home satisfied  Will definitely come again based on our service, again thanks a lot!!! ? Much appreciated the service from Josh tonight. Great guy and also took care of us !"}
{"text":"Best place to come and watch college football while eating some spicy buffalo wings or any of the other buffalo wing sauce combos . They have a great variety of wings which are all really good and they have some good beer on top plus they show pretty much every college or professional sporting game taking place around the nation on their dozens of plasma TVs. They even have plasmas  over the urinals in the bathroom so u won't miss out on any of the action."}
{"text":"This is a pretty busy place. Especially being near the strip. I love doing to go. The short cashier is usually right on point makes sure to repeat our order and tries to up sell me (usually works) & makes sure my order is correct before leaving. I go here every week just do get food and always make sure she is working because that's when I know I'll get taken care of."}
{"text":"I went to this location today and waited 10mins before I was even acknowledged. I was sitting at the end of the bar clearly visible to the bar staff. (2 bartenders) both passed me a few times each. As a bartender/manager the bar didn't seem that busy for 2 bartenders to miss one guest. Finally, I was approached by by one of the bartenders  and then by the 2nd one. The 2nd bartender was very rude. No apologies for not acknowledging my presence. NOTHING! It's kind of seemed like I was a burden just making a Togo order! I usually get amazing service by the others who attend bar. I probably won't return. I rather drive the extra 2 miles and get amazing service at the Las Vegas blvd location."}
{"text":"When we first arrived there was no hostess, we waited about 10 minutes, then a hostess showed up an gave us a table. Service was awful. Waited over 1 hour for our food. The food was ok once we got it, but you should never have to wait that long for food. I will not be going back. The worst part was I actually had to pay for all of this. I could have probably bought a small chicken, fed it for several months, and then made my on wings and it would have actually been much quicker and cheaper than eating here."}
{"text":"Excellent wings and good beer selection! Perfect place to watch the local sports team game with the family or friends (not both). Decently sized place and good patio! Let's go Brownies! (Maybe next year)"}
{"text":"I love wings and this place is only a block from my house! Too bad they have terrible service and gave me food poisoning."}
{"text":"I have been coming here a long time.  However in the last year the food and service has gotten worse. We get take out from there sometimes. I have called the order in and done it online.  It has not been right once in a over a year.  Not only that the food quality has gotten much worse.  Had takeout on New Years Eve day, it was basically inedible. I called was apologized to, told the owner would call, still waiting. My family will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"No phone number can't even call the restaurant?  I had to call another Bww and they didn't have information.  So how can I get a hold of someone there? What a circus trying to get information."}
{"text":"My local Bdubs. Great service and excellent food. Never had a problem at this location and always got great service. Coming from Ohio where BW3'S was started, this place is my favorite restaurant/bar!"}
{"text":"The franchise owner reached out to me and gave me a store credit for my next visit. My fiance and I went today after work since he hasn't had it in a few months. We ordered to go again since we had errands to run after we ate. I explained to the store manager (a different one than I spoke to on the phone) and showed her the messages, let and she was very accommodating and polite. This time around they made sure to tell me that they cannot ensure fully gluten free as they don't have enough room to have a gluten free fryer. I am fine with that as long as they take precautions.  My fiance loved his meal and had 5 mild flats, while I had 5 honey bbq drumsticks. I ate the first one with no problem, but when I got to the second one I had a problem. I found a feather still attached to the wing. I called up the store to let her know and she was very apologetic. I actually had to laugh at my luck. I told her that I still didn't want free things and she told me that the cooks sort through the wings to try to catch those problems, but sometimes they slip through. I assured her it wasn't a problem and I just thought she should know. I ate every wing besides that one which seemed to pretty much fill me up.   While I can't give this location 100% yet due to the issues I've had back to back, I feel as though 3 stars is a whole lot better than 1.   I will be giving them another try in a few months to try my luck again."}
{"text":"Lots of TVs.  Every seat in the place you can view a TV. The food is very good.  I am from CA so, I visit this place whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"They have good deals, and pretty much any flavor of sauce you could ask for. Traditional Tuesday's and boneless Thursday's are the time to go. They recently added a bunch of appetizers to the menu, and if your not feeling like wings, there's tons of burgers and wraps to choose from. They are pretty quick for the amount of people that are always there and the servers are always nice. Also has always has the big fights and games playing. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went to this location, and ended up with horrible service. Food was cold, and didn't get acknowledged by server, but in the end we had an amazing manager come by and totally took care of me and my family, and made us feel taken care of and mattered! You might get a bad server but at least you know management knows what they are doing and is there to totally take care of you!"}
{"text":"The food is just so over cooked.  Why can't this location get it right.  Better off with a frozen bag of tyson and a 6 pack of beer at home.    Please send a new manager."}
{"text":"I would give them no stars if I could! This place is horrible! Had family in from out of town, there was about 10 of us. After about 10 minutes that we came in, there was a group of 20 baseball players. They sat us down before they sat the other big group. We ordered fairly quickly and after about half hour to 45 minutes of ordering, we still didnt have our appetizers but the table with 20 people all had their food and were ptactically finishing! When we tried to speak w the hostess about it, she rolled her eyes and walked away ! Then as we were speaking with the manager on duty, that SAME girl kept looking our way rolling her eyes and giving a nasty ass attitude ! It was horrible customer service and we will never be back !"}
{"text":"When I go to a large chain establishment, I usually expect the food to be sub par and the service to be ok but not great. This afternoon Buffalo Wild Wings took it to a new low. Barely dressed wings, cold food, a waitress who was MIA. It doesn't surprise me that this place is pretty dead. I can't imagine I would go back, I'd rather use my calories and money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Have been in twice since my last review. Its a like a COMPLETELY new atmosphere!! And sorry to say this is not in a good way. Service was terrible and I was emberassed that I actually brought some new people with me to try it out. Just went for this saturdays last ufc fight! They were like natzi's with the seating you have to have 75% of your party with you to get a seat even though my boys were parking and in the parking lot they gave our table away so after getting the tenth degree abou there seating rules we were finally sat all had to sit speraticly through out the bar. We should've just turned around right then but decided to stay... then on top of that we were sat next to some drunk beligerent people spilling and flirting with there server (wich you could tell made her uncomfotable) that table were continuosly getting over served beers. Since there was not one mgr in sight the little time we were one of my boys stepped in and there was almost a fight right then and there.. putting that aside our service was horrible some dude was our server and we went without seeing him for like 30 min and not so cold beers. At that point after one round of drinks we decided not to order food and the table next to us was gripeing about there food so that was another sign to get the F out of there so we paid (once the server got back) then bolted. I wasn't going to yelp anything BUT I just received my checking statement and the dude added 5 to his 3 dollar tip. I gave the guy 3 on $12 he was lucky to have even gotten that. I'm going to find out the guys name and go to upper mgmt because this is not the first time i've heard of this happening there. With that said.. I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN! This place has gone down hill!! . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE !! Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Wings were good but the service was not good at all. Walked in the front door and waited with 2 other guys and had to get a server's attention to be seated. Our server was ok bit we asked for dipping sauces and refills before we got them."}
{"text":"Wow talk about pricy place beers are like 5 and wings are over priced  ......half star"}
{"text":"More than $1.00 per wing. PER WING! This place is retarded. Yes, I just used the\"r-word\"."}
{"text":"Had a blast! Great fried pickles! Best of the best,  local buffalo wild wings's!  Great atmospheregames too! Full service restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love the desert heat wings. Lots of TV's for your sports viewing. The service is generally good the last couple times we have had to return the queso dip as it came to the table lukewarm. Each time the server was very apologetic."}
{"text":"This used to be a great spot for a quick meal or dinner with the kids. Unfortunately everything that our family liked, they changed and ruined it. First the salad went to gross. Then they got rid of the grill that made the chicken wings special beyond just wings. Asking for the wings grilled gave them a nice extra flavor. Then they added too much salt to almost everything. Yuk, we haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time at this Wild Wild Wings, we got great service and the food was very good.  We will return.   Thank You"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Good food,beer and great employees. Great for just hanging out with friends and or lunch/dinner with family. Hey you can catch a game there too. Perfect!"}
{"text":"I loved this place, good service and everything. I came here with my family and they changed the menu. They took out almost everything I liked! The great sliders and the chicken sandwich. Those were one of the only reasons I came here. Now it is worthless..."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, amazing place. Every waiter and waitress i've had have been really nice, the food can sometimes take a while but its worth it.    This is by far one of the best wings i've had. I suggest the cheeseburger mini sliders,  they are great! The wings are cooked properly, the sliders might be my favorite thing on the menu. Every time I bit into a slider my taste buds exploded with joy and wonderful taste.  4 stars would be to low for my rating but i think its a 4 1/2, but i chose 5 , Because it was closest to what i really wanted to rate it.                                   -George"}
{"text":"Last night I went to grab a bit to eat at this location with two of my friends. We were greeted by the hostess of the hour Mackenzie. My friends and I were then introduced to one of the best servers Sydney I have ever came across. She had the most upbeat, smiling personality and AWESOME attentive skills around. The food was decent as always but I would come back just for that awesome service. I have had bad experiences at this location in the past with the  service skills and attentiveness. My point is that Sydney was awesome and very ON POINT with her serving skills. She definitely deserves this awesome shout out. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Placed order at 7 came here at 8 and still waiting for our order...when asked everytime we are told our order is next but it never comes out...so annoying"}
{"text":"SUNDAY AFTERNOON BARTENDERS ARE SOME OF THE WORST IN LAS VEGAS!!!!!!! This used to be my go-to hangout...but I will never go back!!!! :( Last Sunday I went in during the first quarter of the Bears game. I sat at the bar and it took nearly 15 minutes for a bartender to acknowledge me, even tho they were only about 1/2 full. I am a pretty big gamer, and needed my players card. Ten minutes after the girl bartender (never got either of the bartenders names, they barely acknowledged me let alone introduce themselves,) took my ID I asked what the hold up was, she told me she could not find my card and had to print a new one. This is now 25 minutes into sitting here, nothing in front of me and not gaming either. I finally got my card and started to play. Guy bartender brought me the bottle of water I asked him for and took my order. It was the end of the halftime, beginning of THIRD quarter before I got my food. By now I had gambled quite a bit, I had the empty bottle of water on the ledge and no one replaced it. I had to flag down a bartender to get another. When I was done, I went to front and asked for a manager. When AGM came up I explained how ignored I had been. She never even asked for my name, and didn't seem to care that I had lost a great deal of money (which was not her problem, but a gamer should be treated with the utmost respect) and had terrible service. She gave me the GM's card and walked away. I called the next day and left a message with whomever answered phone. I never got a call back.  I will never go back, and at one point in the last year or two, I was one of this establishments biggest gamers and better customers. *shakes my head in disgust.*"}
{"text":"overall short and sweet.   dirty, poor food quality, over priced.  the boneless looked like dehydrated over deep fried and little taste.  They could of been on any drive up windows value meal menu.   The bone in were that all bone little meat.  I looked at them and thought they looked liked they had been found in king Tut's tomb. This was my 4th trip to this location and I'm not impressed and will not be back unless someone wants to meet up there and I can't change their mind to go elsewhere.     I do agree with other posts lack of management, and oversite of daily operations is the key other than massed produced low quality food."}
{"text":"Once again very disappointed.  The fries are great, however the wings are dry almost mummified.  Quality is lacking, not worth the price, I have beter at work from a vending machine."}
{"text":"Awful service!!! Every time I go there it takes forever. Went in last night, waited 30 minutes, and nobody even came to our table! The waitress walked by us multiple times and didn't even say anything. Walked up and explained what happened...they said \"oh sorry\" and took our menus! We left and went somewhere else instead...."}
{"text":"I love me some B-Dubs but this location is just meh.  Been to this location a few times but I've found that the service is hit or miss.  Sometimes it seems that it takes FOR-EV-ERRRR (if you're a 90's kid like me, you read that like Squints from the Sandlot) to get something from the waiters/waitresses.  I swear, one time, we had to ask 3 different people to get us some silverware because the people we asked before never gave us any.  The same thing happened when we asked for ranch.  Then we ended up getting ranch from a bunch of different people like 15 minutes after we asked for it.  Kind of annoying.  If you come at dinner time, there always seems to be a long wait.  Like at least 30 mins...but there always seems to be a bunch of tables open.  Hmmm..not sure what's up with that but whatever.  My husband and I try to just head over to the bar area to see if we can find some open seats or tables so we don't have to wait.  We have always found a spot to sit there so far, so, if you're over 21, head to the bar instead as that seems to be the quicker option.  As far as the food, I love their queso chili fries!  So addicting!  I usually order the boneless wings with medium sauce or the buffalo ranch chicken wrap.  I like both although I wish they would melt the cheese in the wrap.  The cheese is always cold so it's a little weird.  Doesn't taste bad, just would be better with cheese that didn't come right out of the fridge."}
{"text":"Hello sports fan:  At this location it's a great bar, when it's packed it's pack when it comes to sports. I approach the location late. I understand its late for the fight. It's too pack. From the outside lots of people standing watching the fight...lots of people..: there is a two foot brick wall... Wouldn't it be cool to have them sell you wings and take it to you? Mikayala the waitress says \" are you sitting to the restraint\"..I said \"no\" she says sorry I can't get you some wings.. Bad business...  I feel they should sell you wings even if your watching the fight from outside!!"}
{"text":"my fav spot to chill and drink. All the waitress' are awesome.   1 thing though. Women....you don't know what sports are....please stop ruining the games for men. stay home. And keep your children at home too. Thhhaaannkkksss!"}
{"text":"Ordered via the app. Was given a pick up time of 6pm. 30 mins after I placed the order. Showed up and still waited an additional 40 mins. People had come in and order received there food before mine was done. Pointless to order through the app when I can just walk in and order and get out faster."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before preordering wings before the Super Bowl. Don't waste your time at this place. Those who preordered had to stand in line to pay for wing orders that had been sitting on a counter for a long time. I could see my order for 10 minutes before they would allow me to pay for it. I asked if I could pay at the bar or at the normal take out window. Nope, I was only able to pay at the cash register with 30 people waiting. This did not happen to me last year at a BWW in Houston. I asked to speak to the manager before posting this review. She did not appear so I left. Do not waste your time with these yahoos."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with this place. The food has little to be desired. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and it barely had any sauce on it. It was accompanied by lettuce and cheddar cheese (which was weird-expected ranch or blue cheese) there was a lot of lettuce and barely any chicken. Additionally, I ordered the potato wedges thinking they would have so good seasoning on them and they didn't. The service wasn't horrible but it was midday during the week so it wasn't busy. Go to Zipps, much better food and just as good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our first time here.  The food was actually worthwhile, but the service was poor.  The waitress was friendly, but it took about 40 to 45 minutes for our food to arrive and we never even heard a peep from her until it came out.  I would have thought maybe a sorry it's taking so long or something...maybe I'm expecting too much.  Once it did arrive, she instantly asked us if everything looked good.  Being our first time, I wasn't really sure what it was supposed to even look like, so of course I responded with a customary \"yes\".  It wasn't until after she left and I went to put a tomato slice on my burger that I noticed they had left off the restaurants claim to fame, sauce.  Had to wait for her to walk by and ask her and she said she would bring some out which she did.  She never came back by to check on us until we were done and asked for boxes and the check.  Again, she was nice, but just wasn't great at service...maybe poor management?  We were disappointed as well with the lack of enforcement on the no smoking policy on the patio.  The signs clearly say no smoking, but that didn't stop two customers from lighting up right next to us.  We moved inside and pointed it out, but they did nothing about it.  We watched them smoke once more about 30 minutes later as well.  Pretty cold inside too but it's hard to count that against them as I always seem to be cold anyway.  We actually would return because we thought the food was good (the wings were fantastic), we just will be better prepared for bad service, won't sit on the patio (or will confirm the smoking policy ahead of time), and will bring a sweatshirt."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since i was 1yrs. old, and I absolutely love this place. DON'T order Sweet BBQ with ANY hot wing/boneless wings, you will be highly disappointed. But this place ALWAYS rocks my socks =]"}
{"text":"Great place to watch football on Sundays as they have tons of screens and all the feeds. Food is low end bar food. Wings are ehh. Nachos are skimpy. Platter was gross. Go here to watch the games and have pints. Tons of servers."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. Location is great but with that being said, it's always pushy and noisy.  Food in General is good. You might want try the lemon pepper flavored wings. Not a lot of people knew the flavor existed, but it's good.  Also the cheese burgers and mac n cheese are good. Onion rings are good starters as well.  Oh one more thing, good place to be at when there are games going on."}
{"text":"Very very bad service,I visited monady evening the bartender service was very poor and she( Kyle)  is a racist. I ordered wings and chicken sandwich she throwed at me. Advice  to management please give her  bartender training .very very disappointed.my suggestion to other customers please don't sit at the bar while Kyle is servicing.i visited so many places but this was very disappointing"}
{"text":"Barely one star. After years of buying 4 and 5 meals at a time it comes time to split ways with the Mega Behemoth Buffalo Wild Wings. I understand my 400 bucks a year is just a minuscule drip in their revenue but I'm DUN done with them.   Last evening we ordered our normal 4 meals and had it picked up by Postmates. It was delivered. My son and I enjoyed our crispy tender meals but my wife was still at work.   When she got home she was tired and ready for a meal and I had ordered her the naked tender meal. She has always been finicky about chicken but she had great luck with Buffalo WW in the past. When she cut into the tender last night there was a green color in the tender. It turned her stomach and said get your money back.    I wrote an email requesting a gift card for the amount of her meal or refund for that meal the person on the other end asked for photos and I sent them. He then asked for a receipt and I explained that I had ordered through Postmates and they had forgotten the receipt but my order consisted of such and such. He then said you will need to get a refund from Postmates."}
{"text":"This is one of the few chain restaurants that I enjoy coming to on a semi-regular basis. I tend to stick with the classics -- traditional wings and beer. However, there's something in the Wild sauce that's simply addicting. Kind of a legal crack. Show up on Tuesday and it's really budget friendly. Like all big chains, they have constant turnover in staff and some visits are better than others, but I've certainly had more 'betters' than 'others' over the years. But let's be honest, it's wings and draft beer, not haute cuisine and I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Love it here. They have a great wing selection and a fun environment. However the waiters are a tad snobby other then that the foods great."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to stop in since we haven't been to a BWW in quite a long time.  We were greeted immediately and seated where we asked.  The booth we sat at was quite difficult to get in and out; the table had to be moved back and forth to get in and I'm a size 8!  The servers were all very nice and pleasant and the Buffalo Sauce was good.  What was NOT pleasant was the food.  My chicken tenders were not tender- they were dry and it hurt to bite into them.  My husband's Southwest Philly was OK but he asked for the toppings on the side- they were on top of the sandwich.  The TVs were OK - I'm sure it's too expensive to upgrade to newer large screens but what would have been nice is if I didn't have to watch several screens with the same sports talk show on them.  Staring at the same coach talking and not being able to hear/read what he was saying was boring.  I'm surprised so many parents are bringing their babies here.  The place has a large bar and the restaurant has a party atmosphere.  That means there is loud music going on.  I have an app on my phone that senses how loud a place is - it read 70-80 dB while we were there - that can't be good for little ears.  (Constant exposure to 85dB can lead to hearing loss)  With so many other restaurants offering good fare at about the same price, I'd recommend go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is my occasional go to place when I'm making big carry out orders for multiple people. Me and the people I'm with like our wings very crispy. We've had way too many instances where the wings are just big and slimy do to lack of frying. I used order from the one on Savoy and wing would almost always come out big and slimy even when I would request for them to be extra crispy. This location, however, is almost always up to par with my request for crispness. But even in the times where it wasn't to my liking I would speak to the manager and he would always do his best to make it right. All they have to do is keep it up and I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"My 5 o'clock dinner was proving to be too light and too early, and come 11:45 pm, I was starving.  I saw that they were open until 1 am Sunday-Friday, this being a Tuesday, I was thrilled.  I go over there right around 12:05. Doors are locked.  I see an employee talking to a group of customers by the door.  I knock and I see the guy mouth \"we're closed!\".  The door I knocked on literally said it was open until 1.  I might understand if this was 10 minutes until closing, but it's blatantly false advertising to say you're open that late and waste people's time trying to go grab something to eat during your \"hours\"."}
{"text":"We were in Mesa for Spring Training and stopped by . They have a large selection of draft beer and full cocktail service . Most of the time they have a beer on special but you have to ask for it . Wings and food we ordered were o.k. and service quick . Several TV's in great locations so you can catch the action . From the outside the venue looks small it is not . ( This is really a big sports bar ) Yes we will stop back next March ....."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Buffalo Wild Wings, however this location has terrible service. Came in on a Monday at 3:30 there was literally 2 other tables in the entire restaurant. Waited 15 minutes and no one assisted us. Take your business somewhere else."}
{"text":"I attempted to go back to BWW y with my Brother in law who wanted some good wings. We showed up and the location is now closed! WTF? FAIL!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great location to watch sports.they have numerous tvs and can change them depending on your seating.staff is super friendly and attentive.food comes out hot and fresh.beer is ice cold.there isnt a better place to go no matter if you live here or are visiting from elsewhere.management at this location is superb and really cares about the guest."}
{"text":"Fun place. Consistent as chain restaurants go. One problem: I was in there late one night with a friend and we both asked if they had any hot wing challenges. We were just curious ya know. Turns out there is. 12 blazing traditional in under six minutes. So we tried it. I completed the challenge and was told that I would get a free shirt. I left my address and contact info expecting my shirt in the coming weeks. Two months later and no shirt. And that is my only complaint. That won't stop me from frequenting this establishment though. It is always clean, the food is good, and most of all the staff is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I usually come here regularly but today was my first negative experience. We ordered an appetizer and we got it minutes after our \"entrée\"... so I told the lady that i didnt want the appetizer anymore(an appetizer is an appetizer) and that i will not pay for it. At this point, it had been four times ive asked for blue cheese for my wings. Did i get the blue cheese? No. Something so simple to get i didnt get. Its not like i was requesting a well done steak right away, it was just a blue cheese. At this point my wings are really cold and i told the lady that i was not going to pay to eat cold wings. They ended up taking the wings off my tab after arguing with the manager for a few minutes. To put the icing on the cake, my tab ended up being $26 and some change. I gave the lady $27 cash. One 20 dollar bill, seven 1 dollar bills. She came back and gave me two dollars. This chick cant count to seven. Very concerning to say the least."}
{"text":"I don't normally do this, but I finally stopped being sick after eating here last night.   I'd like to preface this by saying this is not a service review. The service was not the problem, although if she would have told me the Blue Moon was almost 7 dollars, I would have bought a six-pack of it on my way home instead. $5 would have been reasonable.  The real problem what what I ate. We ordered the soft pretzels and cheese as an appetizer - they were fine. As a Canadian, when I saw they added a special - Poutine - I had a nostalgia moment and ordered it. It was a long way from the delicious, savory poutine from my homeland. For those of you who have never eaten poutine, it would fit right in with southern style cooking. Take french fries, add creamy cheese curds (or if you're not sure where to buy those, chopped up braided mozzarella works well too), top with fresh, steamy brown gravy. The gravy and heat from the fries melts the cheese into a melty mountain of yum.  This was not what I experienced. First of all, the cheese curds were breaded and deep fried (another special appetizer they had). Instead of the poutine effect of creamy, melty, cheesy goodness, it was more like soggy clumps. I made due, it's been a while since I've had poutine. I asked for no pico de gailo, because I had no idea why it was included in their poutine. I didn't get any as part of the order, so once again, i praise the server for taking a proper order. There was enough gravy, but there was just something...off about it. It was very subtle, but there was a peculiar sourness to it that was enough for me to catch on my palette, but not enough for me to expect anything was wrong other than an odd recipe for one of my all-time favorite meals.   The abdominal pain started at 2 am, about 4 hours after consuming the meal. I'm a tall guy so things take their time digesting...usually. I was not prepared for the razor like purge that followed. Without sharing too many details of the horror stories that went on in that room, I will say that finally, at 12 pm today, I stopped feeling sick.  Now I don't know if it was the cheese curds or the gravy (leaning towards the gravy), but I feel like there were some definite corners cut in the kitchen. If you're going to be serving food to people, what's coming out of the kitchen is a reflection on both the chef staff and the management. You need to have standards. Taste your food. Keep it consistent.   This is the only location that I've ever had such an experience. I hope this criticism serves as constructive, to prevent others from getting sick from the food. Please be conscious of the freshness of ingredients!"}
{"text":"Love this location before spring training games at salt river fields. Awesome beer selection and friendly staff. For some odd reason, not crazy about the wings. Just can't get into them. However the ultimate nachos are awesome."}
{"text":"Just got done working a long day, come to buffalo wild wings to get a drink after a hard days work. Being tired I walk up to the bar and the bar tender refuses to serve me a beverage because I look intoxicated. What the fuck kinda service is this?!"}
{"text":"Never be seated by a waitress named Kimberly. She would never pay attention to you. She would set our food down on the table rudely; Never refill drinks; Never checked up on us. Take our orders wrong. Very disrespectful."}
{"text":"Change the manager!  Service is bad took forever to have our order taken the server's work station was a mess and they were talking to each other, I would think your costumer come first, food was good but overall you costumer service is bad fix it."}
{"text":"Poor service. Took 60 min to get food. When inquired about how much longer our food would be we were told our food was served to someone else. Received a $5 discount.  2  other tables sat after us were served before us. Had to ask for napkins and utensils. Beer took 20 min to get. Was told bar was busy. Gate on patio went off 5 times. Wait staff passed by and nothing was done about it. Won't go back to this place at Westgate."}
{"text":"Why does the music have to be so loud you can't even hear yourself talk? I feel like I am at a dance club!!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch games. Went early to watch the Browns on a Sunday afternoon and get some tables for a group of ten but it did not get full even at game time. Good bloody Mary's and fried pickles! All staff was very friendly and our server Jackie was awesome!"}
{"text":"Best place to go for a beer,  wings or to watch sports."}
{"text":"I love this location. I find myself constantly coming back for the great service I always get from Jessica! She's the greatest."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service. It took forever to even ask for drinks and appetizers,  and once we did, they messed up the order. It was about 15 minutes later that they finally asked if we wanted to order anything else, as if all we wanted was water and appetizers. Our server was nice, but she took way too long."}
{"text":"Sat at an un crowded bar on an un crowded night and waited twenty minutes to order and twenty minutes to get my second beer. It was an hour before my food arrived."}
{"text":"i went here today and I understand it was busy for game time. However, they told my friend she didn't need to come as early as she was going to. Then she got there and it was packed. They should know about the patterns of their own restaurant better. Then, when I got there, the hostess was rude, seemingly because she was so overwhelmed. They need to learn to employ people who can handle pressure, because that's life in the restaurant business. She also didn't seem to even understand what I was saying, so either she was thickheaded or not listening. I'm personally in the industry, and the way she handled it was so ridiculously unprofessional. I've never been to one of these places, but I walked right back out the door and will never come back."}
{"text":"I'm a server, so I have plenty of sympathy for other servers who are busy. On the other hand, I do have a level of expectations. I came here with a group of ten people this past weekend. It took a very long time to get drinks. Additionally, my friend had to ask for her fries three times, and it was obvious it was completely overlooked and had to be cooked right then. Additionally, I tried to get the server's attention to get us a second drink close to ten times, literally. He needs to actually look at his tables and be attentive to his customers instead of just walking by. We would've bought more stuff if it didn't take so long and if it didn't take five tries to flag him down. It was my friend's birthday, which is why we were there, and she almost walked out and didn't pay because it took so long for our waiter to take payment from her. We were just trying to pay and go. I finally spoke to a manager, who really wasn't all that helpful or apologetic. He finally got the server to run our cards (after the server separated the checks wrong 3 times), and that was it. I was merely told this server was new, which is fine. I am plenty patient, but in his second week he should at least be attentive to his customers, and the manager should certainly do more to rectify the situation. I'm also a manager, so I was surprised at the lack of level of customer service overall."}
{"text":"I've been to this B Dubs before and the service was better than my experience today. My server was Doris and she was nice but I honestly felt like our table wasn't taken care of as much as we should have been such as refills and when we we trying to taste test the sauces, we were given sauces we didn't want to taste. It's something small but I feel like it shouldn't have been something to slip up on.  The wings here are pretty good. I got the Asian zing and Parmesan garlic on my wings. The food took a really long time for it to come out tho so it kind of made me irritated. And we didn't even order that much nor was it that busy.   Anyways, I gave it 3 stars because I thought the service could have been way better but since the food was pretty satisfying, I don't want to rate it as if it's a place to not go to. I would go here again but I would definitely like a different server next time. No offense to Doris if that's how she does her customer service but it wasn't to my liking."}
{"text":"If you have your heart set on a game (albeit a preseason, east cost game) & you call ahead to ensure that it will be played at this location, then discover that it's not being played, nor is it able to be played (allegedly), what's the appropriate star rating for such an establishment?   Preseason football isn't a hot ticket, I know, but most people have to venture out into the world of restaurants such as Buffalo Wild Wings in order to catch their favorite teams play. Especially in Las Vegas, where most people are transplants. In order to avoid the disappointment of driving across town to meet a friend to watch a game, I called ahead to specifically ask about which preseason games would be shown & to my delight, was told the Giants-Bengals game would be on. So I headed on down to BDubs...no game. I inquired, mentioning the person I spoke to by name (she was lovely on the phone) & after some back & forth between managers & \"captains\" was told that the game in question was not being shown because they were unable to play it...it wasn't local, but that Broncos-Seahawks game would be on at 7! Well it was 4:50pm, & the Titans-Falcons game was playing on all of the big screens...they're not local either. Naturally, I was disappointed, as was the man at my neighboring table who wore my team's opponent's jersey, but I wasn't truly annoyed until the \"Captain\" questioned my football knowledge. He, being the typically semi-sexist male employee at a \"sports bar,\" assumed I didn't know the difference between preseason & regular season games, & that I was definitely mistaken when I said that the Eastern/St Rose location gladly showed Giants preseason games for me last year. Yeah. You're right, I've completely lost all control of my memory dude. In the end, I was given misinformation & false hope, then I was argued with pretty profusely, but because the waitress was a nice girl & we already ordered drinks, we stayed & ate our ever-mediocre boneless wings. Thanks BDubs, for reminding me why I will watch regular season football anywhere else. Which is a shame, because I do like to see every game."}
{"text":"Everything about this place puts you in a good mood!   We ice cold brews on the deck,  a fantastic,  vibrant waitress and amazing food!  While we were enjoying the beer and phenomenal fried cheesecake nuggets with caramel sauce... (Oooh yeah,  so good!!) the manager checked in on us and let us know of the upcoming game nights and events.   reat service, great food and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Classic b-dubs experience. Buffalo wild wings can be very inconsistent based on where you are but this is a great one. There are great wings and fast service there is nothing more you could ask for."}
{"text":"Worse BWW I've ever been too. Food came cold and my appetizers came after main food. First and last time I will come to this location!!"}
{"text":"Server was okay a bit snooty, food was horrible the burgers were extremely dry! And when I asked for 3 different drink they were out of each liquor! They forgot to give us silverware and the menus were very sticky not a very good experience"}
{"text":"I am writing a review to make sure to improve the quality of foods. It was couple of hours ago(5/23/2017), I went to this location to dine-in but the place quite busy because of Tuesday promotion which I didn't even noticed. I was too tired to wait and make an take out order. cashier Mechanzie was really sweet and didn't take that long to wait for pick up. Everything was so good by then. I came home and open the box and start eating. After couple of wings, I noticed one of the wing is extremely stringy. I felt something different. and pulled away and found clump of feathers. I was so embarrassed and start throwing up since I ate one of them. It was horrible and really disgusting.  (I attached a picture which might hard to figure out since sauce is all over and feather does not look as we know. BUT this is FEATHERS!!!!! )After that, I called into location and same cashier forward to manager Daniel( I am not sure of his name) He said he will give me credit of 5 wings for next time but it is not what I wanted LOL. I do not want that experience at all!!!!!! I don't know if human can eats feathers but for me, I never heard of it. I also googled and figure out it was not only me and hopefully no one could experience no more. It was terrible experience and no one wants to have that experience I believe.  I don't think I can go back but just want to make sure that the company knows what is going on their foods."}
{"text":"Angry Orchard Fiery Apple wild wings!!! Just Wow!  Ya gotta try these.  Our server Chyanne was great and let us move to a better table. Al bit noisy but to be expected at 7pm on a friday. Deliciously worth it."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I have been here.  My daughter (who loves wings) wanted to try it.  We arrived at about 4:20 in the afternoon and were seated right away.  Our server took the drink orders quickly and by 4:30 we had ordered our food.  That was the last we saw of our server for another 30 minutes!  All around servers and kitchen staff were having wonderful chat time at the expense of the diners.  When the server came to ask if we wanted refills, I asked about our food (boneless wings and spinach artichoke flatbread) and was told that it should be done shortly, but the flatbread takes a little longer in the oven.  My refill and our meal arrived at the same time, another 15 minutes later.  I'm sorry, but if the flatbread takes over 40 minutes to make, there should really be a warning in the menu.  Was the food good- yeah.  Was it 45 minutes good- nope, nothing really is, especially an appetizer!"}
{"text":"Was on hold for 20 minutes. Had to show up physically to place my order. Then when I brought up the fact that I was on hold for too long, Yomileen responded with \"okay\".   She seemed like she was busy, so I don't blame her. I blame management here. Quit cutting people to thin and delegate better so they can perform better.  Bad experience."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, Loads of Fun, & good Beer.  :) Friday night however the food took a little long for just 12 wngs.  Other than that A-OK"}
{"text":"I've been to this buffalo wild wings a few times trying to give them the benefit of the doubt but they let me down every time. The staff members are the most rude I've ever met. They take forever even though they have the 15 minute or less timers which they conveniently always forget to give me. \"Selene\" was the worst."}
{"text":"Very slow service, we came in and placed our orders at 733 pm and our food was not delivered till 8pm. This place is not even busy can you imagine if they are busy? No way I would come back here."}
{"text":"The kids the sliders and french fries.  We loved the appetizers and drinks!"}
{"text":"I went with my dad to watch some of the NCAA tournament games on a Saturday around dinner time. The restaurant and bar were crowded but we were seated promptly at a high-top table and the waitress was able to put our game on the TV right by us. Our waitress was great...very friendly and continued to check on us.   The food is BWW food...you know what you are getting. Personally, I love their wings. It is not fine dining but solid sports bar food.   The restaurant seemed cleaned and full of college students, families and sports fans. I will definitely return to watch a game."}
{"text":"Visited this place on 2011-07-08.  I'm a fan of wings, so how can I not visit a place called Buffalo Wild wings?   It's the middle of summer, so we chose to sit inside.  We don't need to fry ourselves in 115 degree heat while eating wings... Place is busy...that's a good sign... and a 15 minute wait was somewhat tolerable. What else would you order at a place called Buffalo Wild Wings?  Buffalo wings, of course!  If only it was that simple..... The \"wild\" part... they have a ton of different flavors/options to choose with your wings - mild to hot, sweet to savory, sauced to dry-rub....  and some none-wing appetizers as well.  We settled for 6 different preparations over 36 wings (6 of each).... and added some appetizers as well (hey, it was happy-hour - 1/2 price on appetizers!). The chicken natchos were good - maybe we were just hungry.  The mushrooms not as successful... oh well.  It's all about the wings, right? Wings arrive... not impressed.  Sauces are hit-and-miss; some were good, some could be better, but the wings... small, dry, brittle bones, and many were not cut cleanly at the joints, leaving sharp shards of bones sticking out - had to pick at them carefully to not cut-up the inside of your mouth.  This is typical of wings that appear to have been frozen then deep-fried.  In focusing on their sauces, they forgot about maintaining the quality of the wings.  Very disappointed...  Not even close to some better wings I've eaten around the globe (see my review of Elephant & Castle in Dublin, Ireland). Ambiance wise, not too bad; it's a sports bar with lots of screens, trivia games non-stop, and a boisterous crowd.  Not a place for a quiet, romantic date, however. I'd give it a 2-1/2 star but upping it to 3 star  since we can't give 1/2 stars - and for the ambiance."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and each time the food was excellent!.  60 cents wing Tuesdays are awesome but be prepared for a packed atmosphere.  Service could be better but they made up for it because they were able to put my game on one of the T.Vs otherwise I would have been very disappointed. I shall return for football season."}
{"text":"Grumble. I would hate to be measured by my worst day at work, but come on \"B-Dubs\" I had a horrible lunch, errrr, almost lunch. I arrived at 11:45AM, before the rush, placed a simple order, only to have you forget it and not even realize it. I walked out after 35 minutes waiting for a chicken sandwich. Give me a break.  The only reason I would come back is that I've had good Happy Hour experiences with y'all. $2.00 drafts."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house. So we go here frequently - especially on cheap wing nights. So here's the deal - we stopped going for a while because the service was terrible and our order was always messed up. We gave them another chance because ... convenience, you know? They've gotten much better with service. We normally order to go and they haven't messed up an order in quite some time.   I know this is an odd thing to notice but they list their sauces in order of spiciness and I definitely think the Spicy Garlic is significantly hotter than the Asian Zing - which by the way is my favorite sauce.   The food is fine - it's a chain so I kind of rate them on another level. The food is basic, nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary and it's good enough.   If you're looking for a quiet meal, this is not the place. When we have eaten here in the past, we spend a lot of the time yelling at each other because it's very loud. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Food bland, service horrendous, inside dull. Avoid."}
{"text":"They are okay wings restaurant except Asian Zing sauce   Wish we have a bonchon chicken in Cleveland like Boston and new York my favorite wings all time number 1"}
{"text":"I like this place. Service is usually good and so is the food. I will say though, they changed the wings within the last couple of heats and they're just not as good. They used to be great, now they're just good. This particular location has a pretty good beer selection as well."}
{"text":"I am not surprised to find this location only has two yelp stars. I think two is extremely generous. The staff is ill mannered and unprepared. The entire dining experience here is severely mediocre. From lifeless French fries, to frozen chicken meat in the quesadillas this location is an embarrassment to the BWW brand. The atmosphere is dead, however the employees run around ignoring customers as if they are working a dinner or happy hour rush. Management is lackluster as well. My waitress was uninformed, and eagerly overcharged and underserved my table. I will NEVVERRRRRR visit another BWW in the state of NC."}
{"text":"I thought I had been to the worst bww here in socal...move over this spot took its place. We walked in and where seated.(it was pretty empty) we waited about 10-15 minutes for our server to come out and take our order just for drinks. She later took our order. I had this feeling that food was not going to be up to par and sure enough I was right.  I ordered a sampler to start the portions givin where small compared to other times I've gotten this. The onion rings made me sad soggy and small. Cold cheese sticks and wings along side a soggy side of nachos. Then the dipping sauces where barly half full not enough imo. Lucky I just passed through and won't have to visit this place agian I feel bad for the locals i feel they won't the the true bww experience."}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes for food at the bar and still nothing has come out. It's not like my friend and I ordered a feast either. It's not rush hour, not a lot of people are in. It's 2pm on a Tuesday..."}
{"text":"Wow! The staff was all very friendly and welcoming when I entered! I ordered to go and it wasn't quite ready yet. The server offered me some water while I waited. So nice! Thanks BWW! A+ from this teacher!"}
{"text":"I love the food here and will always come back. But this time the chicken was under cooked so naturally I brought it to the attention of our server and she did the best she could took it off the check and got me a new one so all is well. it took a long time but was taken care of correctly. It was after I was leaving when a silver maxima  flew up from behind the building and illegally passed my car and blew a stop sign. At the end of the day front of house is good back of house needs some help... And some anger management!"}
{"text":"This place has gone way downhill, the seats are falling apart, we asked the manager to move booths and he just told us to go to another one and didn't apologize. The service was bad.. our young girl waitress was hanging all over her boy coworker in the back right next to the manager and he didn't care. I don't know what's worse.. the price of the food or the food itself :( the garlic Parmesan flavor tasted like Italian dressing and the majority of our boneless wings were breading. I couldn't even finish eating it. Will not be back again."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place, we tried to like it, we just couldn't. As ordinary as the wings were, the service was even worse. The servers either travelled in herds or were invisible, but either way they seemed to ignore us.   Some of the other food was pretty good, but when wings are in your name, you expect a lot."}
{"text":"If I can give this place a negative 10 I will. Rude ass freaking servers. This lady saw us waiting to be seated and she just freaking walk pass us. The hell no wonder they have low rating. Who ever the manager in this place she need to re train her employees. Customers service damn sucks. Guys and gals don't come over here. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have been to many of the BWW locations around the state and all seem to have very similar service and food.  Its too bad their service is not good, because this place can have some great specials and good wings.  BWW also has a decent selection of beer, although there have been a couple of times where the waitress doesn't know anything about beer.  Here is an example:  Me: Do you have Kiltlifter on tap? Waitress: No. (I order something else and she takes everyones else's order)  Waitress:  Well wait a minute, do you mean Four Peaks?  Because we have Four Peaks? Me:  Four Peaks Kiltlifter? Waitress: Yes.....  In summary I would have given this place 4 stars for the food, but the sometimes long waits and the unknowledgeable staff make it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Think twice when coming to this place. Staff will clone your credit card and steal your money. This happened to three friends of mine."}
{"text":"used to have decent service, but gone all the way down hill.  Was seated for almost 30 minutes without ANYONE stopping at our table (the table right next to us had the server there 4 or 5 times and we were seated RIGHT NEXT TO the hostess table and the drink station).  After yelling at 3 servers and them walking past us completely oblivious, we finally reached out to grab the last one that passed to get her attention.  Turns out the whole staff was too busy training on a Friday evening to take care of customers and they can't figure out why folks are mad."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I've had in Charlotte. Came in around 4:00 pm on a Saturday with almost no one there. Took about 5 minutes to get seated. About 10 minutes for the waitress to take our drink order. Another 15 minutes to finally get our beers. I forgot to mention the entire time we are waiting nearly the entire staff was standing near the entrance socializing. Our group was pretty upset with the service at this point. We ended up not even ordering food and took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to come if you absolutely love sports and wings. I'm not that into sports, but their wings are decent. I've come here with friends to play cards before and had a fun time. However, sometimes it takes awhile for the food, and the waitstaff is hit or miss. Also, depending on the flavor of the wings you order, you might want to prepare for flaming diarrhea."}
{"text":"Was upcharged for ordering traditional instead of boneless wings. Several details of our order were not correct. Dressing was supposed to be on the side. Food was almost cold, seemed like it was sitting for a long time before we got it.  Overall bland, underwhelming food. Overpriced for the quality. Felt sick after eating."}
{"text":"First time here and I was not disappointed. Wings were crispy and delicious. Had the onion rings which where also very good. Service great!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had. The bartender (white guy, shaved head, tattoos) was beyond rude the entire time my friends and I were there. He was more concerned about his golf game then serving drinks or food. I had gambled $80 bucks and had 2 Stella's, when I received my bill the drinks were still on it. I asked if they compd drinks for gambling he looked at me rolled his eyes and didn't respond. So I asked again, he told me to chill out and calm down. I just asked the guy if they were compd or not, didn't yell or do anything to deserve that response. When he gives me new bill I payed and he threw the change on the machine I was sitting at then walks off back to his golf game. I come to this location often due to it being close to home. I will not be returning here or encouraging anyone else I know to come and receive shit service. This guy is a scum bag and would prob be making better tips and selling more for the company if he didn't have his head shoved up his ass. Only Thing decent was the food, so props to the chef. The bartender on the other hand should be fired. I'll be calling tomorrow to speak to a Mang and follow up on this BS that was called service."}
{"text":"If you want to be ignored when you walk in and then get served average food, this is the place for you!  The first time I walked in, I waited at the door and one of the employees finally came up to me and told me to seat myself. Okay then. So I sat down and was ignored for ten minutes. Could of been because I was by myself and a female (you know the assumption...woman-cheap tippers which is not the case with me) the place was basically empty...a few guys at the bar and one other customer in the dining room. After ten minutes a server came over and took my order, a beer plus chicken wings. Waited ten minutes for the drink. Fifteen minutes later the wings came out....average food. (This was lunch time so it wasn't like it was a few minutes to closing). I paid and left.  I figured I would give it one more chance and went in on a Sunday after a Browns game...the place was not all the busy (Browns lost that game I guess) I went in and knew to seat myself. There were three servers sweeping the floor and bussing tables. i sat there for for fifteen minutes and after smiling at servers who were too busy chatting amongst themselves or sweeping the floor with no one coming to the table I left.  It is a shame as the location is prime. They need to can the current staff and start fresh, manager included I think."}
{"text":"Very upset that this location does not inform you that you have to be 21 or over to enter past 11. Tried to stop by for a quick bite and left back to my hotel room disapointed. Staff were rude about the situation too."}
{"text":"Love coming back to this location, one of the best ones I've been to. Have tried other buffalo's and they don't top the service from the metro center store. We always get helped out by Chelsea and she is awesome always has a smile and makes us feel at home, also the team captains are always checking to see if we are good with our orders and drinks"}
{"text":"Beautiful place. Came at Lunch with a friend and very disappointed. Quesadilla was cold and I have had better chicken out of a microwave dinner.  We were so excited to come here and the food really disappointed us."}
{"text":"Do not eat at this location! My friends and I used to go to this place all the time and it was great until they had the remodel. The service became lazy and the food took a turn for the worst. We ordered takeout back in March and we all had food poisoning the next day. We didn't go back for awhile for obvious reasons, but last night we decided to give it another try since it is the closest BWW to us. The results were disappointing. We ordered the chicken nachos, a nacho burger, and a chicken salad. We got nachos without chicken.. or cheese, a soggy burger, and the most disgusting lettuce I have ever seen. It shocks me that an established restaurant would send food out looking like that. I'm sad to say that we will never be eating from here again. Find another BWW and avoid this dump!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of buffalo wild wings, It was obvious I searched for it in our Vegas trip. We placed the order and waited for our yummy time. It felt its going to take forever to get us served and kinda pissed off when we observed that the ones who came later than us were being served already and with no sign of our waitress . After almost a 50 min wait, we called another waiter and there turned up our waitress with half of the order. Its commendable that she came out with a reason and apology and the manager himself appeared with the delayed order.I appreciate their courtesy for not charging for it and the taste stays authentic and awesome as always."}
{"text":"I had the traditional wings with parmesan garlic and teriyaki sauce. I feel like it tasted ordinary. The wings weren't that juicy. I think Hooters is better. Their naked wings are the best!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's always very clean, the staff is very friendly, and the food comes out quick and accurate. Today Lauren was or server and she did a great job. She was at our table within 5 minutes of us being seated, with a fantastic attitude, despite that it's a busy night. We ordered The beers came out very shortly after we ordered. The food was great as usual, no complaints on my end. I'll be back next week, same time!"}
{"text":"wish they had a -1 and that is where I would score them. I went to Buffalo Wild Wings with my co-workers, we were the first to get in at lunch, arriving at 11:07am. we were seated right away, our waitress Stefanie assured us that we would be taken care of right away, THAT NEVER HAPPEND!! We ordered 15 mins later. Food never came. we only had an hour lunch. at 11:45am we paid for our food THAT WE STILL DIDN'T HAVE!!! even after the store manager came out, we still never got our food. and when it did come out, she had no clue of who had what, and the food was cold. She then goes on trying to blame the cook. All the other staff and customers had there food and no problem with service. What an AWFUL expereince and I would never go back to that location EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"I keep coming to this BBW because it's close to my work and time and time again I regret it. I will not be coming back again for sure this time! We always order take out which I understand is not as desired for them as dine in, but they have to understand it is a huge part of their revenue still. They always short us on the wings, they always give us an incomplete order, and I think the worst part is they always give you attitude when you talk to them. The only passable person is the manager David (I believe is his name.) He was helpful but I still got back with missing pieces and he did not really help me look if the order was complete. Please save time and effort and don't waste your time. I have given them multiple chances and I am done for good."}
{"text":"I usually can trust Buffalo Wild Wings to deliver a tasty black bean burger no matter where I am at the country. I have been to many Buffalo Wild Wings from the Pacific Northwest all the way down to the Southwest. This by far was my worst experience.  When our food was brought out my nine-year-old daughter noticed that her macaroni and cheese was cold. So we promptly brought this to the attention of the waiter. He was a great waiter and brought the food back to the kitchen. He returned shortly with the new bowl of macaroni and cheese. My daughter took a bite and again the macaroni and cheese was cold. So we sent the dish back to the kitchen and shortly he returned with a new bowl of macaroni. The third and final bowl of macaroni and cheese was adequately warm. It's a shame that it took three attempts to make one dish. He explained that the second bowl of macaroni and cheese was really for a different kid but they just took that bowl and give it to my daughter. So it wasn't even really prepared for her. The fact that they were going to serve a different child cold macaroni and cheese only hints at the idea that they are preheating all of their food and letting it sit out before anything is actually ordered.   I took a bite of my black bean burger and instantly noticed I could not chew it. So I took the bun off of the burger and got out my knife and fork and tried to cut it. It was literally harder than a rock. The knife I was given would not cut through the black bean burger. I'm not even sure how that's possible. The middle of the burger was the only edible part.   My fiancé ordered wings and a salad. The wings were completely oversalted. The salad was scary. It was brown and looked like the lettuce had been sitting on the counter for two or three weeks in the heat of Las Vegas. Needless to say he did not eat the salad.  I have to say that our waiter and the manager did try  to resolve the issue with the macaroni and cheese. Because it took us three attempts to get that dish resolved so that she could eat her meal we decided to just deal with our own bad food and we did not complain about what was going on with my burger or the salad that my fiancé was eating. The manager comped the macaroni and cheese from our receipt. However we still had a $40 bill for inadequately prepared and inedible food. The problem at this restaurant is not the management or the waitstaff. The problem is in the kitchen where the cooks obviously don't really care about what they're putting out of the kitchen. Serving cold food, rock like blackbean burgers, and old brown lettuce is inexcusable."}
{"text":"Hang out after work tonight,  we had couple beers and watched TV.  Our waitress was very nice ! We had some wings, burger and salad. Wings were really tasty , the fish that you made by your own has a really good size. But I order a chicken ceasar salad, and actually for the first time it was \"spicy\" ! My mouth was on fire, I have no idea what they put on , they were nothing wrote on the menu. I just wanted a regular ceasar salad, little sad.. it's a good place for beers, watching TV and eat wings!   And it's also good that they serving late so I can come after work!!"}
{"text":"We love this BWW so much & Katrina is one of the best servers ever! Really fun location with great food & drinks & fantastic staff! Go to spot for gr8 Sports & Munchies & Decadent Desserts!!! Thanks BWW!"}
{"text":"This review is about the location on Cedar Rd,Cleveland Hts,OH  Service is terrible.I waited over 40 minutes to get a snack (5 wings), only to know it had the wrong sauce in it.This wasn't even on a busy day.Had to finally leave the place because it was close to 12:00 AM.The server didn't even apologize"}
{"text":"Incorrect order every single time we give them a try....poor management. Gave them a shot today ordered a total of thirty two wings....12 were supposed to be all flat and extra extra wet. Look for yourself what we received...all flat and extra dry. Gave them a call and manager says,\" well someone signed for it\". You've gotta be kidding me...if the receipt and box shows what I asked for how do you manage to ruin it??????"}
{"text":"Every other time I go in there something happens to the order. Tonight I went in there with 3 other people and after sitting there for 40 minutes the waitress tells us there was a mix up and our food will be right up. Of course it came up 5 minutes later and everything was ice cold. Then i tell the waitress we dont even want the food at this point and she says she will send the manager over which took another 5 minutes. We didnt pay for anything and left which was fine but Ive also had a similar experience going in there in the middle of the day when we were the only people in the place. Cookings wings isnt rocket science and this BWW is now equally as bad as the one on Craig. I guess I will try the Galleria Mall location if I want to go to one again."}
{"text":"We started with the tacos that were tiny and just average in flavor. I had the shrimp po'boy and it was ok my friend had a steak wrap that ended up being steak umms not good at all. Probably won't be going back. It was disappointing at best."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. The service was awful! We were seated and then waited for almost 20 minutes to be acknowledged. We had to flag down a host for someone to come to our table. Other tables around us were seated, placed drink and food orders and we still were not acknowledged. The waiter was very short and he didn't tend to our table at all. We had to flag down other waiters to fill out water. By the time we got our food, we were already irritated and the food was cold and didn't even taste that great. Other tables around us were disgusting and had not been bussed the entire time we were there. Buffalo wild wings lost some long time customers. We will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Wow this place needs help. Last weekend was my second visit and both times have been horrendous. My wife and I walked in and waited for the two hostess at the front to finish their conversation. I had to walk up and ask for a table. One girl rudely told us to sit where we want and someone would bring us menus. We waited about 5 mins for the waitress to walk up and ask us what we want to drink. She didn't know the drink specials so we both ordered water. We both ordered wings and they were small with little to no sauce-not to mention cold, like they had been made the day before. I would have let our waitress know, but she never came back to the table. We asked for extra napkins when the food was dropped off- never got them. With mediocre food and empty waters we were just ready to leave. I found our waitress by the bar and asked for our check. She said she would bring it right over. We waited for about 10 mins, left cash on the table and left. Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Wow I wish I would've checkout out this location before going to watch a game there with a buddy. I have to agree with all of the other 1-star reviewers on here. The service sucked big time, and I could have made food just as good at my house. I've never had wings with BWW, maybe my review would be a little higher. Definitely not the best food from the 3 or 4 times I've been, and this location had the worst service....our waitress seemed like she was having a bad night, and seemed to have an attitude. She left half way through the 3.5 hours we were there, and not a single person even checked on us for 2.5 of those hours (it wasn't even remotely busy!!!). The only reason I gave it  second star was because it is a good place to watch a game (tvs everywhere). Listen to the majority: DON'T GO!"}
{"text":"Slow service it 45 min to our food and they wing were not even properly rolled in sauce! Terrible"}
{"text":"Getting better, and it seems the cooks have changed as the food just seems a higher quality"}
{"text":"I went to one Buffalo Wild Wings about 6-7 years ago and wasn't a huge fan. Every time family or friends wanted to go, I said no thanks. If I did go, I got a child's meal. Well today I decide to try something new. I was so glad I did. It was perfect! We got the $4 mozzarella's sticks as an appetizer and the marinara was amazing!  If you haven't been in a while - try it again, either they are mixing things up or my taste buds changed!"}
{"text":"Consistently the worst buffalo wild wings in town. No one answered the phone i come in and no one is even at the take out window. They always have bad service here.    Go to durango and warm springs. Dont waste your time"}
{"text":"The basis for the three stars in this case is the happy hour and Thursday specials.  Generally I think Buffalo Wild Wings aka BW3 (although the T-Mobile salesman pointed out to me that no one  calls it that anymore) is well OK, not great, but I would normally put this in the \"meh\" category as I feel like they are over priced for what you get on any day but for their specials. Normally, they charge extra for extra ranch/blue cheese and carrots/celery - really? Always a pet peeve, it costs them mere cents so they should just give it to the customer for free and factor that in to their already high mark up for wings. OK off my soap box - Thursday night - 60 cent boneless wing night (mini chicken fingers). For 60 cents I can justify paying 60 cents to get blue cheese. The mini chicken fingers were small but crisp, my only complaint was that they didn't toss them in the sauce that well so only have of each mini chicken finger (MCF) was coated. I got medium heat - which was plenty 'o' heat for me. Also, ordered the Chili Con Queso with chips for $3 on happy hour and the onion rings. Onion rings were super hot (in temperature) the chili con queso I wouldn't order again, I realize it was only $3 but it was just a small cup of the nacho cheese you can get in a can with a small dollop of their house bean chili on top - \"meh\".  Anyway, happy hour goes until 6 (I think) with $3 app specials and $3 domestic drafts and several $3 spirit drinks (Jack and Coke, Absolut etc). They have the normal bar fare on the $3 happy hour list - fried mozz, chips & salsa, onion rings, chili con queso and a couple of others. But for $3 you can't really beat it. It was plenty loud in there but I assume it was busier because of 60 cent wing night and if you want to see a lot of sports TV and not be in a sports book then this is a good alternative."}
{"text":"I was with a group of eight people that went to Buffalo wild wings in Medina, Ohio our service was the worst I have ever experienced. When we arrived I informed the hostess that we were with a bus tour group and we had one hour to eat could old they accommodate us, she said they could. We were seated and waited 30 minutes for the waitress to take our order. When we tried to get the waitress's attention she at us \"what\" we tried to explain the need for someone to take our order she was rude. After someone took our order we waited another 20 minutes and still had not received our food. We complained to the Mgr which he offered a 25% off the bill but by then it was to late because we did not have time to wait any longer. While all this was happening  other people came in and we're served."}
{"text":"Have no ac  for 2 weeks. Very hot in side and was told will not be fix for 3 to 4 weeks. Serves was ok. Food was fast to table. Management needs wake up  and  take care there  workers and customers."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst BWW!  Several of the other reviews spotlight my issues as well service is horrible and often very stingy with sauce.  I will not be going back to this BWW"}
{"text":"This place had horrible service. I paid for baskets for the fundraiser and they made me wait 40 minutes for my table of 4. They also got my orders mixed up and refills as well. We also added a chair to our table and they told us it was a fire hazard, and mixed up our orders. I would come back but only for take out."}
{"text":"We are VERY frequent BWW customers (3x a week), but every time we take out from this location, something or everything goes wrong.  Another location I frequent is always on point, but this location just can never seem to get it right.  I wish they would take a few more seconds to put some pride in their food prep so that we can have the yummy food that is BWW's standard.   On a lighter note, whenever we dine in, our server Dave is always awesome and friendly.  He makes sure our food/drinks are up to the standard they should be.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is very busy. They pack it in and the tables are right up close to each other. The dining area is cluttered without any room to move around lol.   The hostesses are friendly and ask if you'd like to be at the bar or in the dining area. On a hot day, everyone is inside.   The service is fast and friendly. The food is good."}
{"text":"Not bad, have seen them in the states but never made it in. Service was on par for calgary, wings big and well cooked. Hot sauce was actually hot which I downed with a bottle of pepto lol."}
{"text":"Horrible service from start to finish. The waitress was rude taking our order. Not friendly or welcoming at all."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for several years. I used to come almost once a week after work, when the late night specials were great. Now I remember why I don't come anymore. The late night food specials suck compared to what they used to be here and suck compared to any other late night dining option. Service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and wings galore.  The wings are deep fried and not breaded.  Gluten free. The staff are really friendly and they will cook your wings to order. Sauce on the side? Extra crispy? Drummers only? No problem.   If you are looking for a great wine selection or cheese plates them this is not your place.  Kids are welcome during the day but i do not see any after 9pm.  They are open late.  They have a fabulous selection of craft ales and micro brews.  Cheers!!!!"}
{"text":"Wings are super tiny and not saucy enough.... I rather take my lonely elsewhere for wings like real sports bar and grill..."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place,  but today the service was terrible. We had to wait forever for our meal, (and no they weren't busy, as a matter of fact there weren't that many people there),  then we couldn't get refill, no one came back to our table. When we asked about our food it still took a while and then the order was incomplete,  I had to go up and ask for the remainder of the order (ranch and carrot sticks) they said ok and we never got it. Grrr"}
{"text":"Today we stopped in Buffalo Wild Wings for lunch. We were immediately sat, by a very friendly's server, someone greeted us immediately and took our drink order.  Our server was very schooled on your menu and made suggestions. One thing though that we did not like is during our 40 minute lunch we were interrupted at least 10 times by different personnel at the restaurant asking us how things were going this in our mind this overcompensation.  Shared an order of chicken wings, and we were only brought two little paper containers, we had to ask for more.  I think it would be nice if they had paper plates are some kind of a plate for their bones and such, if  they want to share other things on the plate like fries or Appetizers."}
{"text":"Always have a good time when I come here.  Jessica makes Tuesday nights fun.  Would recommend to a friend. Don't leave without trying the pumpkin porter.   It's Amazing!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Waited for 10 minutes before anyone came to our table and that was only after we asked the hostess.... Order was wrong when it came out, wings were luke warm, servers were oblivious. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Enjoying a refreshing Strawberry Mojito, watching football before heading into the Phoenix Coyotes preseason opener against  the Kings. Couldn't be happier about a BWW in the Glendale entertainment district. Crowded and loud but that just enhances the excitement of Sunday football."}
{"text":"good wings and great saucy choices.  what you expect from a BW3.  service was ok to good, setting is a bit open an not really inviting...like a big box.  The monitors on teh booths are a bit annoyuing, I only sit at a booth without one..."}
{"text":"I have never been so upset and turned off at a restaraunt before.  Went out for a night with my friends and it took over an hour to get out food! The waitress NEVER bothered to let us know or offer us a drink on the house...something. After all that wait I get my popcorn shrimp only to find the most pathetic looking shrimp that were not deceived.  I was so disgusted.   Never going back to this Madison location."}
{"text":"A terrible lunch that ended in physical pain.   Wait time for lunch - A   no wait Waitress - B - smiled, friendly, good drink refills, the problem is that she brought me the food.... see below. Food - F - as others noted, cold and wrong, literally made me sick within an hour -   boneless wings with cheese fries. The fries had so little cheese sprinkled on them, and the wrong kind of cheese, that we sent them back. Second time around they didnt have much more cheese than before. Wings did not taste very good. I only ate half.  The unforgivable sin is that I am now spending my afternoon running to the boys room due to mild food poisoning. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We will start with a positive.  Service is good.  Now the not good!  Went to use the restroom.  There was a female staff member holding the door open and a male staff member holding a soap refill.  Stood there for over 5 min for the the bathroom to clear out.  All the time I'm thinking \"they don't have a female that knows how to change to the soap refill so they are not closing off the bathroom!  Then it's the matter of cleanliness!  The sink in the bathroom was plugged and it looked like someone had vomited in the sink.  For all the time the employee stood at the door you'd think she would have noticed.  The fans on the patio are so filthy you wonder if the dust build-up is going to fall off on your food.  And lastly the floor in the restaurant is terrible.  It was only 5:00 o'clock and there were so many crumbs, straw wrappers, and other garbage on the floor I have to think nothing had been cleaned since they opened.  I really like Buffalo Wild Wings but I think this location needs new management or something!"}
{"text":"First impressions go a long way most of the time and my first impression of this place is bad.  I'll start with seating. When my friends arrived with our party of seven, we waited a good 40 minutes to get a table. After what seemed like an eternity, they offered us a booth. The only problem was that we had a couple stockier guys in the group and a booth would be less than comfortable.  After another 40 minutes we were finally seated.  After we were seated, I noticed the only good thing that this establishment has going for them. Wall to wall TV's. That was not enough to keep me happy. I opened up the menu and saw the prices. This place was way overpriced for the quality of food they had. In other words, crappy food at an unbelievably high price.   Our waiter took our drink orders, which was efficiently done, but after that I would only see him two more times that night. He refilled our drinks once and brought our orders. After we were done and he took our stuff, we waited a half an hour for the check. Needless to say he did not get a great tip.  In summary, this restaurant is the exact opposite of what a good restaurant should be. Don't eat there!"}
{"text":"Went here a few times while scouting out the Medina area.  A little outside the downtown Medina area, but convenient to 71 & 18, so easy to get to.  Lots of TV's and a great beer selection.  Food was decent and the staff was friendly.  Will go back again to watch sports and enjoy some at food."}
{"text":"Before we moved to Vegas, BWW's was one of our fave places to go sit, eat, drink, and play super fun trivia. We were soo excited to see one so close to our home. Unfortunately this Bdub's has the worst service I've every had in any resturaunt. We tried this location three times...Not on one, but TWO occasions in an almost empty resturaunt  I had to get up and get our order after we watched it sit in a window under the heat lamps for around 20 minutes without a single server in sight... On our last visit after waiting for a half hour for the server to bring our check just to dissapear into thin air again, after another 20 or so minutes we paid our bill with the bartender and left... After we were out the door our waitress suddenly appeared and yelled that we forgot to leave her tip at the bar... SERIOUSLY.. So as sad as we were we admitted defeat and our wing cravings will have to fufilled somewhere further from home."}
{"text":"Love this place. This is the second time I've came here with my family. It was my husband,my 4 sons,who  are ages 18,14,3 and 1 and myself. We got the best customer service and greeted by 2 smiling hostesses. We had the luck to have the same server both times.Luis was very attentive,sweet and patient. When it comes to servers I was very happy with our Luis. One of the best server Ive ever had in all my dining experiences.Food was great and served in a reasonable time. I definitely would recommend you guys to many others."}
{"text":"Over priced.....the wings are tiny.....everything is a la carte......and the portions small. Wild Wings are much better."}
{"text":"Food is what you expect from this place. I really enjoy all the games in tv and the chicken fingers and cheese curds are delicious. However the service at most if the Buffalo Wild Wings I have been to lately has been sub par. Especially his one here in Scottsdale. Last time I was here I left because I was dining alone they said I could only sit in the bar"}
{"text":"The boneless wings are the most terrible wings I have ever eaten, there is more crust on the wings than the meat itself. I am pretty sure they get an ounce of meat and deep fry it 5 times over. Definitely not worth 13 dollars. At this point, I'm not really sure if I'm really full or my stomach just hurts. But the service was good."}
{"text":"Every time my girlfriend and I go into this restaurant we get interrupted constantly by at least 5 different servers asking if everything is ok. Literally one will walk away and immediately another server walks up to our table."}
{"text":"Went up to this location (which is closest to our home 91st Ave & T-Bird) specifically because you can get a black bean burger made like any of their burgers.  Placed an order online.  When we got there, asked if we could take a table and eat there.  The staff was very accommodating, but after waiting about 15 minutes, our server informed us that they were out of black bean burgers.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement. However, the manager picked up the tab for our lunch.  That was doing as much as he possibly could in my book.  My chicken wrap was ok.  Husband's burger was great according to him.  Noisy!  But, it's a sports bar/restaurant.  All in all disappointing, but it is what it is and management stepped up."}
{"text":"We are a family that loves wings....we were not disappointed. The food options are great. It is on the pricier end but worth it. Service was great....drinks never went empty...was check on multiple times. Great place."}
{"text":"Food was good expect i think they gave my bf the same thing as me even tho he didnt order that but we didnt say anything  Waitress was nice and helpful It was fun. Love the tvs, the trivia, the crowd and i think was so good (get the buffalo chicken wrap)  Ill be back very soon:-)"}
{"text":"The food at buffalo wild wings is awesome. The only problem with this particular one, is the service. The only times we have been there, which are a handful of times, it either took forever to get our food...or they forgot us. We don't order anything special, it's famous for wings, so we order wings. The two times that were the worst go like this. First, it took 1 1/2 his to get our food. People that came in after us had come and gone. Second, the waitress didn't even put in our order. We sat there waiting for an hour, seeing others get their food, and finally asking what is taking so long. The waitress told us that she hadn't even put in our order. She apologized, which is fine, it happens...but to have such bad customer service multiple times at the same facility is very bad for any company."}
{"text":"The most disgusting Wings I've ever eaten in my life. The wings in my opinion were raw but the manger claims that they're cooked to a science, all I can say is my wings were bloody, absolutely no flavor, and they put very little suace on the wings. Oh ya, way over priced!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:30pm on saturday. Waited 15 minutes no one showed up. Only had 3 creepy people at the bar just hanging out. They did not have any food or drink just on their phones.  It was like a children of the corn moment. The chairs in the dining room were all put away... I thought this place opened until 2am.   We each took a mint and left. Went buffalo wild wings and got tater tots."}
{"text":"My family and I visiting Phoenix went there for dinner on July 14th after the Diamondbacks game. As the place had just opened, it was swamped and there was quite a long wait. However, I think it was worth the 30 minute wait. For appies, we  tried the buffalo chips (okay, but not as crispy as advertised), and onion rings (outstanding). The beer selection was excellent and the kids enjoyed the non-alcoholic drinks too. Most everyone had the wings and we all enjoyed those. Basic buffalo was excellent and so were the lemon pepper wings. One person in our group had the boneless wings and said they were very good. Popcorn chicken was great too. Service was very attentive but you could tell it was a new restaurant. We were a party of nine and one order was completely missed but after it was brought they offered to take it off the bill. Of course the room itself with all the screens and sports events going on was awesome, although my youngest daughter faced a wall that was featuring UFC fighting which upset her so we had to move her. So be aware if going with younger children. All in all, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Food comes out the same as any other BDubbs. However, the service isn't too fast. I feel like they are always short on waiters and the same ones are serving more tables than they should be to provide adequate service.   This is the place I would order out from."}
{"text":"Edit: I gave this place another chance and the service is really good. As long as you order a carry out when it's not busy af then its a great experience. This is a good b dubs location. Will come again."}
{"text":"WINGS BEER SPORTs, Iove that they Newcastle on tap. BWW has nba league pass so u can watch ur fave basketball team play, just ask the captain. Try mango habanero flavor wings, chili con quest for appetizer. Then if u have the balls do the blazin challenge. The only thing I don' like is how small the men's restrooms r. Almost 11every dude is drinking . That means they need more than two urinals and one stall. Hence four stars not five prefer bww than native and hooters."}
{"text":"Wings are good. Best to go on a Tuesday or Thursday for the specials, otherwise is a little pricy for what you get.   The service can be hit or miss. But I find if you are pleasant and chat them up a bit it helps with the service."}
{"text":"Disappointing compared to the US BWW I've been to.  The price was very high for how many wings I received.  I did like the medium sauce, but the fries for a side were very disappointing - needs to be something more exciting like house breaded onion rings.  May try again on a cheap wing night."}
{"text":"When you base your business on doing one thing, you should do that one thing well.  These were not world-class chicken wings - they were simply mediocre.  Service was okay, but slow and inconsistent.  Patio was great, and the beer was cold, so I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We went in to watch the World Series and have some wings.  The wings are good, but the time it took for the food was excessive.  In addition, the wings are small and slightly overpriced.  I will return, mainly for the atmosphere and beer selection, and not the overall menu."}
{"text":"Food was awful. Cheeseburger was so dry, burnt and over cooked. Wings were not tossed in sauce enough, they were dry as well. The service was good though. Waitress was very nice and tended to all of our needs."}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I stopped in for lunch while walking around the city. They were slow so we were seated quickly & our food came out fast as well. Although they were slow, our server checked on us infrequently. However, the mild boneless wings my girlfriend ordered were soggy & a bit chewy. When we asked if we could get her wings replaced, the server said \"Well that's how they come, but if you want I can get a new order for you that's extra crispy.\" Seriously? Who wants soggy, rubbery chicken wings? This is not how they are supposed to come. We did get a new order, though, which was better. I almost always get the dry rub sauces & there was hardly any on my wings. The amount of sauce you get seems to differ from place to place which seems like a problem with training. The point of a chain restaurant is consistency & it's been very inconsistent for us lately. BWW is one of our staple restaurants and it's unfortunate that we had an experience like this here."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! They closed half the restaurant at the start of a football game and told us they couldn't accommodate a party of 10! The bald bartender was such a extremely rude to my friend when she asked how she could get service. I will never come back here, not even if I was starved for 30 days."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for dinner,  and one star overrates our experience. We were seated right away, but after 15 minutes of waiting we had to go ask for a waitress to serve us. We waited a long time for our food and had to ask for silverware. Finally, we were overcharged. The waitress double charged us for the wings we ordered. So, we had to wait another 30 minutes to get our bill corrected. The icing on the cake was cold food."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Buffalo Wild Wings before but I don't remember the food being this good! We started out with nachos with chicken for an appetizer was super yummy! The cheese and chicken was fresh. The tortilla chips fresh and thin! I had the buffalo child ranch wrap! It was great and super fresh as well! The waiter was prompt and overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"I went here the other day because it was a Tuesday night, and my friends were a bit bored. Their Tuesday special is now 65 cents. I remember when it was 40 cents. That was only about 4 or 5 years ago. The price just seems to keep rising.   I read that they offered an happy hour. I was unsure of what the time, and I asked when there hh was over. The server said, I don't know what time it is. uh.... okay. HH is 3-7. The appetizers include mozzarella sticks, onion rings, roasted garlic deep fried mushrooms among other things.   They also have a limit of 20 guaranteed flats per table. The wings tasted normal. The service was okay. Nothing exceptional. She did check up on his a few times. Before I got there, my friends wanted to try the buttery maple flavor. Another server brought us a sample of the sauce with fries to dip it in. The fries were awesome, not the flavor though.   Nothing special about my visit and nothing special about the visit. Slight irritation about my hh question. Isn't point to promote business?"}
{"text":"The 3 stars are for the food ONLY! Get it to-go or suffer through the wait lines on any sporting event day because they don't take reservations ahead of time, and the shoddy excuse for service.  Oh did I mention you REALLY shouldn't order water because it takes like dirt and smells like chemicals."}

{"text":"I thought we would go out to eat and our daughter choose wings! We all got wings. Mine tasted like soap gross I still have that taste in my mouth.  Wont be going back there ever!"}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings has the worse customer service.  I have been to other locations and never experienced this bad of customer service anywhere else. Our waitress only came to take our order and never came back to see if our orders were correct or refill our drinks. The guy that dropped our food off said he was coming back with more ranch and never did.   We never received boats for the bones from our wings so resorted to putting them on the table. When we had asked someone else to assist is she rolled her eyes and with attitude asked if there was anything else we needed. I would go to any other location except this one."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I kind of like this place and how convenient it is to go here after visiting the mall. The people that work there are always smiling and willing to give you ideas about good food on the menu. However, this place could work on being a bit cleaner. Especially on the floors in the dining area and the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Bad management & bad leadership!! Tables don't get cleared & sit dirty & unavailable even when there are a lot of customers waiting for a table. Even the manger walks by the dirty tables & doesn't do anything about it. You would think that at the very least he would tell somebody to clear the dirty tables. We witnessed a table sit dirty for over 25 minutes....... Wow! Will not be back to this spot."}
{"text":"Wow what a bad night out at Buffalo Wild Wings. We had a large group outing and called ahead to see if they could accommodate us and the answer was yes. When we arrived they seemed confused about our reservation.   Regardless, they were able to seat us fairly quickly. We ordered drinks and they arrived about 15 minutes later. Our server was kind but a bit frazzled at the prospect of managing our large party. She did let us know that she would be having another server assist her. The other server never showed. After another 15 minutes our meal orders were placed.   Our dinners took between an hour to two hours to arrive at our table. The kitchen staff produced our orders in the order that each check was put in but instead of them all being served at once to our group they were staggered in fifteen minute to thirty minute increments.   It was awful to sit there waiting for friends to be served. Finally, some of the group ate their meals while others waited for an hour for their meals. The kids were starving, the parents were irritated but patient, the server was apologetic and kind... And then there was the manager who was put off by having to deal with my concerns, making excuses about how busy they were and telling me she didn't realize how busy they would be this evening. It is Saturday night during basketball season. It's a sports bar.   They kept seating our servers section while she was supposed to be handling a 20 person party. Most restaurants will stop adding to a server's section in order to keep from overwhelming their employee. The kitchen was terribly overwhelmed and disorganized. Based on the number of staff I saw, it's not an issue of understaffing, it's an issue of poor training, poor organization and poor management."}
{"text":"The only reason I come here is just to fix my craving on wings, other than that I try to avoid this place. They have Terrible costumer service! Food always takes a long time to come to our table and the servers seem to hate their jobs. When we complained why the food took so long the manager came to our table to \"apologize\" but instead he was RUDE!!! No wonder why the servers seem miserable"}
{"text":"Went for the half and half. Caribbean jerk with a dry rub. Super satisfied, I finished off my sauce on my napkin. After I was done I tipped the bartender and told him I'd be back again for some jerk. Lovely."}
{"text":"BW3 is not fine dining and I pretty much know what to expect but I am sad to say this experience fell really really short.  Arrived @ 8 pm w/kids ready to have a beer, wings, watch a pre-season game - sat outside to avoid the 'bar'.   Waiter took a bit to come over.  Ordered our drinks (took a while), ordered our food and waited... (OMG, I could have raised chickens myself, slaughtered and cleaned them, and them cooked them up faster). Food came - luke warm but edible - waited for refills - waited to express the need for a side of sauce - waited...waited...waited... Meanwhile, our waiter was enjoying what appeared to be a birthday party with friends or family and paying ALOT of attention to this large table of personal guests...and the other waitress on the patio was enjoying the attention of a crowded table of high school boys who referred to themselves as fallices (I may need to explain to my kids why thick di@* and big d$#k are not appropriate nicknames) and messing around on her cellphone (which she admitted to the boys she shouldn't have out).  A credit to her - she held her own with the heckling boys and all in all she proved to be the saving grace in this experience.  Skipping to the end, our waiter asked about boxes (my daughter needed one), and then disappeared for about thirty minutes.  The next time we saw him, he was saying goodbyes to his family and friends, forgetting that we were still waiting.  The girl recognized the disgruntled table and made eye contact with us as she was attending to her customers.  She knew that there was an issue. At that point, my husband left me at the table and took the kids to the car at my request.  It was close to 10 PM, they lost all patience, and they roudy boys were getting worse (while funny to me, my daughter was feeling intimidated) and language became more colorful. The waiter came back with the box and check, asking if we needed anything and I said no, my family is waiting in the car.  I honestly think it took a second for him to process what went wrong.  He apologized as he handed me my $68 bill then walked away. I was ready for change in seconds...no surprise that I waited.  Until, the young lady came up and asked me if I was ok.  She kindly took the bill to get change for me (ironically, our waiter came shortly after) and promptly returned.   In a situation such as this, I probably shouldn't have tipped close to 20%, after all the service was worse than awful, but I hope that our server realizes that he is lucky that the worst I will do is write a poor review rather than compromise his income.  Many others wouldn't have tipped at all - in hindsight, I wish I had thanked and tipped the young lady who I initially thought wasn't any better than our waiter but saved the evening in the end. This is the first and last time I visit this BW3."}
{"text":"The wing flavors are good although I have had better. Expensive for bar food. A great sports bar atmosphere that is for sure."}
{"text":"The one star was for the food which was pretty solid.   I've been to this location multiple times and one thing is consistent: poor service. Actually, the service is awful.   Side note; on one occasion we ordered wings and they charged us $0.65/ea for ranch/bleu cheese...who does that with wings?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was seated immediately.  I waited for a full 10 minutes and not one server took my drink or food order.   I left and will not return to this location--they weren't even that busy. I am a fan of BBW, but this location isn't good."}
{"text":"I would have rated this place five stars if I really enjoyed the food. I was not in love with the chicken sandwich I ordered, however my girlfriend enjoyed her wrap. I have to give a lot of credit to the staff of this place for keeping up with the black friday crowds, keeping a clean restaurant, while making sure that the food came out quick!"}
{"text":"Great food horrible service . Make sure you have a lot of time when going in"}
{"text":"Ashley I. is THE best waitress! So glad she came over from the Elliott location by McQueen  Park, after it closed down. Always has great recommendations. Always makes sure you're having a fun time. The staff makes sure you get the game you want, anytime you ask, even for Canadian Hockey Leagues. :) P.S. Try the dessert nachos!!!!!!"}
{"text":"GO ELSEWHERE!  Trust me.  We were a 7-top.  After putting our group name in and waiting, come to find our they \"lost\" our reservation while we stood at the podium with their pager in hand.  Unmanaged teens couldn't seem to handle seating.  Our waitress started off friendly, but her efforts soon became very lackadaisical.  Our food arrived 29 minutes after ordering and only one plate was warm, the rest were  room temp or colder.  Cold onion rings have little appeal.   Good thing we ordered finger food because the whole time we had one set of silverware, even after mentioning this to the server.  No manager to be found.  One of us managed to get one drink refilled.  We mentioned our issues to our server, but her response was merely defensive and excuse-laden.  No apology or offer to correct at all.  Their boneless wings are awful.  Even our hungry teen wouldn't eat them.    Should have gone to Smashburger instead.  There are plenty of choices for restaurants within steps of here."}
{"text":"Jay Jay is AWESOME!!! We're a giant crew (10) and she was able to handle all of our rapid- fire questions and needs. She was super fun and very helpful."}
{"text":"WAY TOO LOUD!!!!!   Tuesday Night at 6:30pm.   Children are permitted.. not sure if it is just for dinner hour or all hours.   Food is A++    Very reasonably priced. We had boneless wings, mozza sticks, nachos, onion rings and FRIED PICKLES mmmm.   Atmosphere .... was a bit too loud. I am not sure if it is the way the room is designed, but the volume of the space was just unbearable. They blared the music, and yelled on a mic. I am all for a fun place but I felt alone at the table with my friend. We couldn't hear each other it was painful to try and have a conversation.    I will never suggest this place for a group of friends - we like to be able to have conversation not just eat and awkwardly stare at each other or pretend to be watching a tv.  I will go back. I will go for the food. Actually looking forward to trying one of their burgers."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. It is my favorite place to grab great wings in a great friendly atmosphere. Service is always fast and the beer is always cold. Food comes out to the table in a reasonable time. Never have I had a bad experience. Servers are super friendly.  Friday nights are usually busy and there is quite a wait for table seating. But since I  am lucky enough not to have kids I am able to skip the long wait time and head straight to the bar area for immediate service."}
{"text":"One star review for their response to my phone call. Almost 6:00 on a Saturday called to ask if there was a long wait and the girl on the phone said she was NOT ALLOWED to answer that question. What the heck is that?  You can't tell me if it's a 20 minute or 40 minute or no wait at all. Makes me just assume there is a very long wait (otherwise why wouldn't you want me to come right in), so I won't be bothering to try."}
{"text":"Worst BWW I've been to. The cooler behind the bar was making a loud grinding noise that no one could do anything about so they cranked up the music to drown it out. Bartender complained about being hung over. Food was good but every other BWW I have gone to was a far better experience than this one."}
{"text":"We went for dinner about 8:30pm and it wasn't crowded. We sat at a booth and requested the game system. Food was good. I had the sliders and my friend had the wings. He ate them so they must have been good. We played the silly trivia game on the handheld players and had a great time. The service was good. It was noisy but lots of tv to see sports and more all around you. Fun date night"}
{"text":"I am going to start off by saying that I am a fan of BWW, but this location is lacking bigtime in the service department. I love the wings, and I always have...but the other food was bland.  The service was HORRIBLE. The waitstaff were very unprofessional...even for a bar setting. The host, Craig...I think his name was...told us that if our server wasn't good that he would \"Strip her and stretch her out\"...how disgusting is that? Oh, and we didn't go at night...we went for a BUSINESS LUNCH.  We weren't given menus.  The people who brought our food carried on conversations with one another that were of the sexual nature that I really didn't want to hear...one server with blonde hair and too much eyemakeup was very vulgar and too PDA-y with her coworkers.  There was also another server texting on her cell phone.  I wish this place had better service, we will never be going here again!"}
{"text":"I come here for boneless wing Thursday. Service is quick at 11am, food is good if you like bar type food and reasonably priced ( on Thursday )."}
{"text":"This place is AWWWWWEEEEESSSEOOOMMMMEEE!!! I'm so happy to have found it.  I'm not here to review the rest of the menu because I don't think it matters...all that matters is how are the darn wings right?  Well let me tell ya! They are stupendous!  They are just the right bite size (I hate those HUGE wings) and they are steaming hot and juicy.  They have a large variety of sauces from mild to their famous \"Blazin'\".  Well I eat super hot so I went staight to the \"Blazin\".  I was so afraid that it wouldn't live up to the hotness level that it claimed but NOPE...it was HOT.  I was sweating all over and fidgeting in my seat from the spicyness  but it was also deeelicious too.  So if you like super hot wings that actually taste good too...you have come to the right place."}
{"text":"First time I ordered carry-out from this BWW.  Bad news.  I ordered boneless wings...but what I got was a bizarre assortment of pieces of chicken some the size of a cheese cube (like you'd find on an appetizer tray) and others the size of a slightly flattened C battery...lousy comparison, I know. But nothing was the size of a chicken wing. Regardless of size, each piece was chewy tough...and the smaller pieces were hard, almost crunchy.  I ordered a mild sauce and the Caribbean jerk sauce -- because I like spicy -- but these two were lava-like!   I've been an in-house customer and never encountered such terrible food at a BWW.  Perhaps it was ordering carry-out at 8 pm on a Sunday night that was the culprit.  /Regardless, I will not order carry out here again...and will approach a sit-down with some apprehension."}
{"text":"Love this place. I go to this one and the Gilbert Rd location frequently. Love the beer, especially at happy hour or Thirsty Thursday. Love the boneless wings especially the Caribbean Jerk and the Asian Zing. They make an awesome burger too. Don't forget to get a basket of buffalo chips with that burger."}
{"text":"So the GM here got fired for being a scum bag (my best guess, but he is), so now I can return to liking it. The staff was always cool, and servers like Kat and the bartender Amanda are great. Mango habanero is the best sauce around, just be ready for a burn if you try it."}
{"text":"I almost didn't go because of the bad reviews. I am very glad I did because it was a great experience. The waitress was a delight and the service was perfect, the food was wonderful. Don't let some bad reviews stop you from giving a try."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Expect a long wait to be seated, to get service, to get your order/drinks, your check. It's like they hate return business and want the wait staff to get poor tips. The only thing fast about BWW's is the diarrhea that comes after eating the food.  The wings are SMALL.... if you like eating bone then this is the place. The other \"food\" on the menu tastes like something cheap from the frozen food aisle at Giant Eagle that they deep fried for a 3x mark up. Try another place if you want the \"sports bar with wings\" experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been going to this particular B-dubs for about 3 years and have no notable complaints. The food has always been fantastic and exactly what we ordered, the service has always been welcoming and friendly but not over attentive, and the atmosphere is fun. Although our favorite waiter has recently left, the others have all been awesome. The downsides would be that the place gets packed when the fights are playing and it is sometimes hard to get a table, and also when it is that busy the food comes a little slower. But that is to be expected and it is no fault of the staff. I highly recommend t this location, love this place."}
{"text":"The late night bartender MIKE is horrendous... He was racist to the African American couple sitting next to us... I heard him tell a coworker they were \"coons and didn't belong\".  Family guy with sound was blaring on all of the screens and sound.  Food was cold and the experience was not up to buffalo wild wing standards.  If choosing Buffalo Wild Wings I suggest going anywhere but this location."}
{"text":"Server was josh sat in the lounge area.. waited at least 50 min for our food a table sitting in front of us that came in after us.ate paid and left before our food was out... had to ask for refills service sucked the cook in the back that brought out food gave us more attention then our own service... sad"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of their wings and,of course, their cold beer. Last night was louder than usual but still a fun sports atmosphere."}
{"text":"Before coming here, I had pretty low expectations. An American chain coming to Canada can be really hit or miss (I'm looking at you IHOP!), but I was craving some good wings and this place wasn't too far from my place. I met my friend here on a Friday and it was already quite busy. They definitely cater to a wide range of people, from families to bros that want to watch the game. Speaking of that, in the lounge there are TVs EVERYWHERE so you are bound to find a game you want to watch there.   We didn't have to wait long for a table. Bonus! Our waitress was really sweet and made good recommendations. The wings were pretty decent. I wouldn't say they were the best wings I've ever had, but they passed the test. I had medium heat wings (not too much sauce, which I actually liked as I hate when wings are literally swimming in sauce) and I also had the Kickin' Honey Garlic. I didn't like that flavor as much, it was pretty basic and didn't have the 'kick' it promised.   Overall, I think this place is perfect for young families or just watching the game. Their wings weren't mind blowing (which is interesting, considering they have 'wings' in their name), but they were decent and were perfect with an ice cold beer. Not a place I would frequent regularly, but if I want some wings, I'll stop by."}
{"text":"Ok well i stopped by for a to go order and this chick that took my order was awesome not only did she ask my questions she also hooked me up with extra blue cheese so im so used to getting my order screwed up at other places she had it correct and when i said thank you and tipped her she was like thanks alot i really appreciate it....  She had an awesome personality sorry i didnt get her name only downside to this thurs was they took 20 mins but the carryout girl at noon was great!"}
{"text":"It's always hit or miss at this location . Some of the servers are super nice and friendly, while others are horrible, and really rude. I still come to this location because it's the closest to me. * insert big sigh here*"}
{"text":"A virgin to buffalo wild wings till tonight! I found my new favorite hangout! Great atmosphere with a \"live\" attitude! Came in after midnight to a handful of people. Told the bartender i was a first timer and that spicy wasn't my thing and he recommended the Buffalo mac n cheese with the spicy garlic and it was delicious! ! Drink was never empty!! I'm in the service industry myself, and it's official,  DREW is officially the most awesome bartender in Vegas... kudos to the hot guy doing his thing right behind the bar!!"}
{"text":"I tended to come here with my friends during the day, so it wasn't very busy and service was fast. The only problem I've had was visiting once at night where they'd run out of silverware(they were understaffed and looking to hire at that time) and we had to use plasticware, but the manager apologized profusely for this and was very polite.  Never had an issue with service, everyone tends to be friendly and attentive. The food is tasty and filling, though sometimes their boneless wings don't have quite enough sauce on them. I've tried about 6 of their sauces and they're all delicious, same with their appetizers. I suggest exercising caution if you ever order the dessert nachos, from the menu picture my friends and I got the impression that they were much smaller than they really were, and couldn't finish them all because it was so large. All in all though, it is a good place for reasonably priced food and good deals on wings."}
{"text":"Me, my buddies and family and buddy's daughters come in and eat here about twice a week. We all have only decided to come in when server Gavin is on shift. He is always on point with our orders and has a great attitude when we are picky about what we want! We will definitely be back to see Gavin and bring all of our friends! Thank you for great service and positive attitude!"}
{"text":"If i could give this 0 stars i would! This place is a joke i go here 4 times a week n they probably get my order right maybe once! Not only do they tell you 15-20 min and you end up there waiting another 30 mins on top of your 15-20! Even the manager is pathetic Lee Lund is her name and if you have worked in this business like i do you realize your customers come first! She has a terrible attitude and her employees match just that. It sucks i have to go here so much but i love the wings at any bww despite the service! Ive lived by this bww for 3 years now and this by far is the WORST YEAR!"}
{"text":"Had the best experience ever the server name was Nicole she was so energetic and sparkly she came by and made sure that are we were enjoying our meal and that we had everything we needed she was very helpful we were asking her questions about places to go by we were visiting Las Vegas and she was just all around helpful and enjoyable and the meal was wonderful we give your restaurant and the server and Nicole Kens Kars if we could thank you Buffalo Wild Wings and thank you to the server Nicole"}
{"text":"Okay I guess the spot is alright for someone wanting to watch endless sports.  MEN, right...men!! But those overpriced chicken nuggets leaves more to be desired!!  I feel sorry for the men that don't get to watch their sports at home, because if they go there to eat, drink and watch the games.  They are being ripped off!  I was disappointed in the chicken, and could've bought some nuggets at McDonalds and poured sauce over them myself for cheaper.  I guess it's something to do, for a bachelor that don't got nothing else better to do with his money!"}
{"text":"RJ is the shizzzznit!!!! Drinks are always prompt.... And delish!!! Bartender Joe is funny and entertaining!!!!  Always good service!!!"}
{"text":"Don't order a burger!  Maybe it was Buffalo because it wasn't good.   My fault .. they are known for Wings and I order burger."}
{"text":"They just reopened.  Tons of TV's, lots of waitstaff, nice clean place.  Wings and beer are relatively pricey (best is 60 cent wing Tues with $5 22 oz drafts).    Native New Yorker actually has better wings but this is a newer restaurant with a lot more HD TV's and room to move around in."}
{"text":"We had the best waitress ever here!! I don't remember her name but she had braided long hair. Literally the best waitress I've had in years"}
{"text":"Definitely coming here more often! Great customer service. I ordered about $50 worth of food for pickup. They told me it would be about 30-35 minutes. Well not realizing the time, I came over an hour later to pick up my food, which had been sitting out at that point for about 30 minutes. Needless to say nothing was hot anymore. Knowing it was my own fault I asked what was the best way to reheat the food to make it hot again. She told me to hold on and got a manager. She told the manager what happened, he asked if I had been waiting in line for the food the entire time and she told him I just got there. He said okay, put the order in again and told me it would be a little bit since they had to re-make the order. I definitely wasn't expecting them to remake it again. Especially since it was such a big order and I'm the one that came late. Very impressed with the quality of service and food! I will be more than happy to come here more often for food! It's rare to find that quality of service! Thank you BWW for the great service and hot food! :)"}
{"text":"Worst place ever Asked to sit in front of tv that had game on after 1st quarter changed channel Manager said someone asked to change station no one else sat where they could see tv"}
{"text":"The wings are bomb. The fries are the best i loved the chicken wingsthank you. Amazing fries!!! The food was incredible the service was amazing I will recommend it to my friends and family will be coming here again again and again and again and again and again!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered veggie burgers, fries, onion rings, other fried foods. We explained several times we were vegetarians. We later learned that they use beef fat to fry their food."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here a few times and I dont know why I go back? The food is average at best and the service most of the time is slow. Seems over priced too. I guess I wouldnt mind the food if it was a better value because the aptmosphere is fun. They should have better beer specials or something."}
{"text":"I am not going to say that I receive excellent service always.  I think it really depends on the mood you show up in.  I have been to this restaurant at least 50 times.  Super Bowl Sunday and Playoffs is one of the servers hardest days/nights.  They are working double the volume of service.  I have had excellent and poor service.  But, out of 50 times, I have only been disappointed once.  Unfortunately the poor service is the part people always want to write about.  I think the food has always been great.  I usually get my wings, original, naked, zing-sauce on the side.   Because the chicken really has great flavor and the sauce is a little much if they serve it wet..   This place is known for bar food munchies and not elegant dinning...  So, with that in mind the service is always fast, cheap, and food is great.  Well, tonight was a little different.  The bartender has. 1/4 holes in her ears (from plugs I assume).  She was rude, and made rude comments  at least 4 times to different customers that had been paying a tab for 2.5 hours.   I wasn't offended because I wasn't directly involved.  But, I could tell that the comment offended the buyer.  Here is what the guy said innocently to the punk rock bartender with gapping ear lobes.   \"So  that's a cool tatoo, is that Harry potter?\"  No answer.  The customer then asked.  \"I'm sorry did that offend you?  \". Bartender \"your face and presence offends me\".   And there was no laughter.    If you alter your body and society asks a question.  Isn't there an appropriate answer? Or at least a comical outcome for the sake of bar-tending?   I have lost a little respect for bw's.  And I'm just observing..     Beginning this review I initially punches 5 stars.  After tonight's visit to champaign Buffalo Wild Wings, I have lowered it to 3.."}
{"text":"Food tastes old. Bland food on a Sunday night served with terrible service. No water refills. No prebussing. No manager in sight. Can't wait to pay and leave."}
{"text":"had a great experience for late lunch today. Service was awesome and food was excellent... hasn't always been that way. Today was a great day!"}
{"text":"Tonight we not only had delicious food but we had outstanding service! Kudos! Well trained, polite, & timely staff. Two \"captains\" checked in to see how our meal was going - offering refills & additional beers. We will be going back for sure!!! It's great to have another yummy family friendly restaurant close to home."}
{"text":"Its getting there. Food and service was terrible when they first came around a couple years ago. Its much better now but the staff could be quicker with seating and could come around to the tables a little more often. I appreciate that they want me to get my food as soon as it comes out but many times i can never find my server. For the price i expect a little more effort for 20%"}
{"text":"Where to start? It's probably going to be the last time I eat Buffalo Wild Wings. It is extremely over priced for the product. I go about every other month. But today I realized that the food is no longer worth it. I got an order to go, wing and fries. The fries were cold and I live .5 miles away. As far as the wings go, I used to get a large order of traditional wings, which consisted of 20 wings. Now they claim that the wings are larger than they used to be, so you only get 18 wing with a large order.The wings are the same size as the were a few years ago. Yet they claim that they are bigger, so they can justify the ridiculous price, which is the same as it was with the 20 wings. The flavor has steadily declined, and today I found 2 small feathers stuck to one of the wings. I first tried buffalo wild wing in 2006 at Witchita Falls TX, during air force training. Shortly after in got stationed over seas for 4 year. Finally in 2009, I made it back to the states. I was surprised to see that Vegas, my new home had BW's. Since then I have witnesses the corporate greed destroy a good restaurant. I hope some day they reinvent themselves or fire the top brass, so that they can get back to what they once where. If I could give this place no stars I would. Unfortunately I don't know how."}
{"text":"Folks are nice... food is mediocre... timeliness of service is terrible. Wing King in Fort Mill for me."}
{"text":"I ordered to take out. They forgot to include an order of mozzarella sticks (still charged me) and the side salad I ordered was placed in the same bag as the hot food that it was all limp and warm     I attempted to call them to tell them they got my order wrong and it's busy  Hopefully they fix this and respond to this review on a good time to call to get them to fix it"}
{"text":"Sat there for 15 minutes and was not served. Not even drinks. They really don't deserve 1 star because they did absolutely nothing for us."}
{"text":"The sauces are good but the wings are the size of a childs thumb. not worth the price."}
{"text":"Great service from Alexis and Charlie really took care of us. Great experience. We were traveling for work with ten people and will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service! Even though the manager tried to make things right by apologizing and giving us a discount, we will never return to this location."}
{"text":"First visit. Amazing service! Everyone has a terrific attitude. I love the captain idea! Sauce samples by request.I would visit again. Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"We found a mouse, scurrying through the main eating hall. No joke. Told the manager and walked out. Didn't seem like she cared. I think this is plenty for a review."}
{"text":"Gave it at least one star because the food was as expected but the service was absolutely atrocious.  Waited 30 minutes for a small cup of ranch.  Waitress came by 3 times to ask if we needed anything.  We would ask for the same things every time and she would not bring it.  Asked for our check and that never came.  Went to the front desk to ask for the check and they had to get our waitress.  She finally brought our check and then she left. I tried to pay at the front desk and they said I had to pay with the waitress. By that time she was already gone and I had to go find her. I finally just left cash on the table and left. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Bad experience here today. Service was extremely slow and food came out cold. Whatever, no big, just another unsatisfactory restaurant experience that would go without a review or comment from me. But then it was time to pay, and the waitress DIDN'T BRING MY CREDIT CARD BACK. I tried to get her attention multiple times but she ignored us, along with every other server around. I decided to walk up to the counter to find the manager myself, and happened to glance to my left at the waitress station where the computer was.... And saw my credit card sitting out in the open where anyone could take it, completely unattended. I was LIVID. I looked around for a server or manager or someone to talk to about it but there was absolutely no one to be found. I will be checking my credit card statements quite frequently for the foreseeable future. Buffalo Wild Wings in Rivergate, the poor service was one thing but the complete disregard for people's credit cards and financial security and privacy is absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Took forever to get our food. Food was lukewarm, Fries were cold. Asked for two new orders of fries, one delivered (they did take one off our bill). Women's bathroom totally closed, mens restroom was 1/2 functional. I ordered a beer, not knowing restrooms were not usable and I have a weak bladder(mind you, I am a woman and cannot use a restroom here). Had dirty silverware, was told dishwasher was broken. We were told the owner was asked to close restaurant for the night and he refused. Very terrible experience.  I really don't even want to give it one star. I will never return. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hold. Up. I've been to many Buffalo Wild Wings in my life time... smh. Worst service I ever got. What's sad? I know some employees here (they weren't there that night) but it's sad that their \"coworker\" (not gonna blast her cuz she might of had a bad day) and manager (bald head semi heavyset guy) had no decency. Let me explain...  Everything was straight. Got our drinks. WATER. Ice Water. We're still great. Ordered our food about 10 minutes into sitting (8:15p). We're still great. My family and I were conversing, everyone's having a great time. We're still great. (9:00p) Waiter comes over and basically and blames another table for the order taking a while aka she never put the order in. (9:15p) I ask the manager how long it will take. This dude NEVER came back out! Hahah HE knew they fucked up. (9:25p) food comes out. We're half way out the door. We get the food. Didn't get a few orders we ordered. We're like fuck it let's just eat. It wasn't even enjoyable at this point. Manager still didn't come out. No sorry from the manager. No sorry from the waitress. She still making it seem like we rushed her. Ge the ticket. She adds sodas to our ticket. We only got water. We dipped out after paying. She says \"You guy's are awesome!\". Like we passed the test of getting the worst service and still paid y'all whack asses.    All they had to do was be upfront and let us know they fucked up or that shit was taking longer than normal. Easy. But I guess they thought THAT would make us mad. B-Dubs Insecurities.   Shouts to my friends who work there tho. They never served me personally but I can tell by your customer interaction that they appreciate you for serving them. One love to y'all. But the manager? Seems like the guy to manage a police department and blame a police shooting on the body cam not working."}
{"text":"I had an exceptional experience at this location. We had a large party that had a venue fall through at the last minute and with Hurricane Joaquin upon us which didn't help things. Not only did this location give us a great outdoor covered area but it was well heated against the storm.  Our servers were Sarah (blonde) and her server in training. They were on top of everything from the minute we walked in, and with a smile. They gave great drink suggestions and even when our party was moving and mingling they made sure no one was with an empty drink. Thank you for making what could've been a rough night a memoriable night with family, friends, and great service!!"}
{"text":"This place is garbage. I've tried it multiple times and every single time is a disappointment. Servers are awful, terrible attitudes, management is a joke, the wings are hard on the outside and cold on the inside, and have barely any sauce on them. Every single time. I've been to several locations in Vegas and California and I'm seeing a terrible pattern. Every single location is bad but this one is by far the worst. How this place is still in business is beyond me."}
{"text":"Thursday night,  before an anticipated Guns N' Roses concert and they run out of: limes and ranch dressing?  At 6 pm?? What a joke!!!  I'd give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Yuck. I hardly call their food \"food\". The wings taste frozen and severely over-breaded, the sauces are alright, but everything is WAY overpriced. I'm getting wings, not a steak. If I'm going to spend $15 a meal with a beer, I'm going to Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"We have never had a bad experience here. Great wings, ice cold beer, and fantastic staff.  Much better than other BWs we have been to."}
{"text":"omg! The music sucks! Can't enjoy delicious wings with Dance Music ringing in my ears!"}
{"text":"This location \"participates\" in the 15 minute fast break lunch deal. Basically that means they give you a timer after you order your food and if the timer reaches 15 minutes your food is supposed to be free. The past two times I've been here the timer has been long past 15 minutes and both times they came up with piss poor excuses not to give my table free food. The manager is an asshole and the waiters are some of the stupidest people I've ever encountered. Do not come here to eat."}
{"text":"I don't have anything bad to say about the food... Graveyard service is terrible and the bartender shouldn't be allowed to be the only person there to help customers(white guy, bald head) since he's rude and unprofessional.. he also shouldn't be allowed to have his friends there since he's more interested in serving them and himself instead of the other paying customers.. hope you enjoyed the tip last time cuz if I ever see you again, I'll be damned if I give you one cent of my hard earned money."}
{"text":"Used to go there often but haven't returned in almost a year.   The wings are small. The service is tolerable. The management is horrible. The music too loud.   Just to name a few. You can see for yourself."}
{"text":"you can't go wrong with the wings ... my wife and i come here a lot an we've never had any issues with customer service either.  Service is always fast and efficient and haven't had any issues.  We definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wild Wings and used to go to the one in Afton ridge a few times a week. This place, however, is horrible. I am 27 and my girlfriend is 31. We said \"we will just sit at the bar\". The host stopped us and asked \"uh...are you guys 18 and everything\"? I laughed it off, answered yes, and walked to the bar. Here, me and my girlfriends IDs were both taken and held under black lights.   All of this is laughable and I can look past. However, the service was also horrible. I ordered a salad which came out with my wings. When the server brought the food she said \"here you go\" and walked away. 10 minutes later she came over to peter us about some rewards thing that no one cares about. Didn't take no for an answer twice and left the stupid thing by us.   She is currently moving back and forth between  slurping whipped cream or some thick white substance out of a cup and counting her tip money with a disdained look on her face. With the occasional gossip at the table 25 feet away from us. What is actually going on in this place though?? I waited tables for 8 years and never saw anything like this.   And the wings were gross."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, it took 15 minutes just to be able to place our order. (Mind you this is our lunch break). Even though the cheeseburger sliders were the same price as the pulled pork sliders they would not do one of each style on a plate, that just couldn't be done. Then it took 25 minutes to get our food. I was not impressed by the service and disappointed by their lack of flexibility in changing up my order so I could try two of their menu items. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Do you want stale half-made nachos? Come to Buffalo Wild Wings. Want a rude waitress? Buffalo Wild Wings is your place!  The waitress will tell you to eat with your fingers (if you ask for silverware) and the manager will tell you the kitchen forgot to finish making your food. I'll never come here again."}
{"text":"I put my order ahead of time because I live  20 minutes away my husband got there bartender  didn't put the order  is always something when we ordered  from this location  he told my husband he was busy jajaa  is was 4 people only blah blah  .. 2:30 am Wednesday  ."}
{"text":"Me and my buddies came in for a Monday football and our server Justine was on point whole night even though she was slammed with orders from other customers. I work in nightlife and I know how hectic situations like that can be, she handled herself perfectly! Thank you Justine"}
{"text":"Vacuuming floor literally 5 feet away from my table wtf....lots of TVs, good food and friendly service..  Im not the type to write a book on my experience...if I go back it will be because friends invited us to come along"}
{"text":"Family and I went out for something we thought would be a meal we cant make at home but were we wrong. Chicken tenders were COLD! Waitress took them back to the kitchen for maybe 3 minutes and they were unevenly warm and i assume because all that they did was put them in a microwave. Sauce was slathered unevenly and everything else on the table has gotten cold by this point. Refills are hard to come by but the worst disappointment was the food that should represent BWW. Frozen, out of my own fridge would at least be cooked to health code regulations and i wouldn't at least have to worry about that. Will not return!"}
{"text":"I went to your restaurant on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd in Scottsdale tonight just after midnight MST, and I was served several items for which there was apparently an \"upcharge\" of which we were not informed.  We asked for these items to be removed, upon which first the waitress argued with us, then the Manager (Steve) first told us it was \"our fault for not reading the menu more carefully\" and then agreed to remove the charge because he was going to \"bill back the waitress for her mistake.\"  In other words, he was trying to guilt us into paying for her mistake because otherwise I was taking money out of the pocket of a waitress presumably making less than minimum wage."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been there twice and each time the kitchen has gotten our order wrong. The first time I figured it was because the restaurant had just opened and the kitchen was new. Now this second time they got our order  (6 Asain Zing 6 BBQ traditional) wrong (they gave me 12 zing) and we got the mis-ordered wings free. Also we got the wings (the BBQ) that came out free because it took a long time. Now to top this experience off when I started eating I found a hair beneath the sauce of my BBQ wings and no it was not mine. The only bright side I can say are the servers are excellent the kitchen it just a sorry excuse. Until I hear the kitchen has gotten their act together I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I've visited this location a couple times now, and overall I'm really not impressed.  Food I found to be tasty, however as other's have noted, wings were on the VERY TINY side!  The pretzel and dip appetizer was great though!  Service is friendly, however not your \"typical\" sports bar type of staff....if that's what you're looking for.  In my opinion, the only reason to visit this place is if you want a place to watch the UFC site, which isn't crowded and has large screens.  Otherwise, there's much better options out there."}
{"text":"The only reason this place got one star is 1) because I couldn't give it zero and 2) because the food was good. At 5:00, we walk in to an empty hostess station.  We stand there for a solid 5 minutes.  I'm looking around for someone to notice us but no one comes (btw, there was more than enough staff there just standing/walking around).  While we are standing there, we notice there is a till (cash register) just sitting on the counter with money in it...yep.  We should've left then. We finally get seated at a wet, still sticky table.  Sit for another 10 minutes waiting on a waitress to come get our drink order.  Finally gets us our drinks, gives my 7 year old sweet tea when we asked for Sierra Mist. She finally comes back around for our food order around 5:30.  And we wait, and wait, and wait.  6:15...we get our food!  Yes, 45 minutes later!  We have been in this restaurant for over an hour!!!  Oh, btw, the restaurant was not busy at all and like I previously stated, there were more than enough people working. We get an apology from the waitress but no visit from the manager, nothing done to try to \"make it right\". We will NEVER go here again!  Just as a side note, every BWW I've been to in various states and cities has horrible service and long wait times....this however, was a whole different story!"}
{"text":"Not bad. One problem... Ya serve beer. Ya serve wings. Booze and hot n spicy food. That's fine and all but ONE bathroom stall in the mens room ?? Really. BAD idea. BAD"}
{"text":"Horrible service! We arrived at 10pm were seated and weren't offered at least water or a drink. Well 15 minutes went by and nobody hadn't approached us. We asked to people across from us and they were waiting for a long time and they were there before us. So we just up and left! And from other friend that were with us said this place takes a long time to serve!"}
{"text":"enjoy the food, service is good, and the beer isnt expensive...enjoy sitting in the bar area, because service is faster"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Sat there for 10 minutes with my 3 year old son and no one came to the table. 2 groups of people got helped who walked in after us. So worst service ever. Need to work on greeting people. The place wasn't even busy. I give this place a zero"}
{"text":"I am a regular! My boyfriend and I come to BWW AT LEAST 3 TIMES A WEEK! We LOVE IT! However this is my 3rd CONFLICT with a server Amoora I believe it is. In the past she has given me serious attitude, does not go over the menu, or list ANY specials, she does not fill up or water, we walk up to the soda machine and ASK for water. PATHETIC! We received a discount the last time we had her but this time is completely unreal! How in the right mind do you come up to a customer and ask why I didn't tip you enough?!?! We came to watch the NBA Finals. There were 7 of us, we all ate around 6 and and didn't leave until 9pm. Someone from our party left without paying which tends to happen sometimes when you stay for a long period of time. I had contacted my friend and she was on her way back before we even got our tabs! Amoora came up to us, talking with her hand on her hip being rude as can be telling us we can't leave until they come back. Which is totally understandable for her to say IF WE WERE READY TO LEAVE! WE WERE STILL SITTING AND TALKING AND HAVE NOT PAID OURSELVES! I didn't say anything after her being rude. But for a waitress to come up to a guest and ask for a good tip?!?!? I could NOT BELIEVE THIS! I have never had a problem with anyone else! She is just not fit compared to the rest of the amazing workers there. SO DISAPPOINTED!!"}
{"text":"We've given this BWW franchise several tries and each time they've bombed. Very disappointing considering the other Buffalo Wild Wings in the valley are good. Mismanagement plays a huge part - the staff seems unhappy, management is defensive and rude. The atmosphere at this location is lousy. The wings are tiny sample sizes compared to other BWW locations (and overcooked every time), salads are smaller too. Five out of five times they've messed up our orders - both dine-in and takeout. We won't be back. Worst review I've ever given and unfortunately well deserved! :("}
{"text":"I always get the same thing it never fails. Caribbean Jerk Chicken I love it. I sit play poker and drink beer. There are plenty of TVs to watch the game. Great place to bring the kids variety so everyone can have what they want. The poker game is digital now and has more games the people are always friendly"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings (B-Dubs, to those of us in the know) is my go-to place for wings. Yeah yeah, don't tell me about the hipster joint you frequent that has way better wings - I'm not interested. B-Dubs has consistency, and they have over a dozen sauces. Add to that Tuesday wing nights, and Boneless Thursdays, and you've got a pretty good setup.  This location is at the mall, which is convenient if you want to swing by before or after shopping, and they have a nice outdoor seating area. The restaurant is clean, and service is pretty fast. The last time I went here was with a group of 12, and I thought for sure that would be a disaster, but it was actually very fast and there were no issues.  If you're into sports, they have a ton of televisions, so enjoy that, and if you're not into sports, try to avoid nights with sporting events, because the place will be packed."}
{"text":"The customer service at this b-dubs is unreasonably good.  They're quick, friendly, and frequently check to make sure you don't need more wings or drinks.  From any seat in the house you can see at least a dozen TV's.  Unfortunately, they're all showing various types of sportsball, so there's not much to watch."}
{"text":"I placed a to go order when the restaurant was extremely busy.  Katie was very knowledgeable and helpful in placing my large order.  She was also very polite and friendly.  She did a great job during a very busy time"}
{"text":"Let's face it... it's Buffalo Wild Wings which is pretty much standard when it comes to BWW food you'll find at any BWW. Visited this particular BWW about 5 times to visit with friends to watch some games. Been to several of them across the nation and honestly.... not my first choice of places to go in Las Vegas (or even in my top 20 places for that matter) with so many GREAT places to go.  Food isn't bad but nothing to rave about. Mixed drinks are pretty weak. Do anything more than your typical drafts and you'll be paying the price.  Never really worth reviewing this place in the past but the following incident earned this place a fantastic 2 star rating.  Met up with several people that love to go there to watch a game. Ended up at the bar and a couple of people were sitting at the bar next to us as we played the machines and we chit chatted a little. The girl I was with easily put over a couple of hundred dollars in the machines and I also put in some money and played. Ended up with a tab (yeah.. it's one of those places) which I paid. The people sitting next to us were also playing the machines and ended up leaving. Guess one of them did not pay their tab.  Right after they leave... I have a Bartender ask me in front of the lady I am with: \" Are you going to take care of his tab?\"  I asked him why that was my problem and he went off on me. Next thing he says is: \"I'm tired of you guys coming in and not tipping me\"... SERIOUSLY??? The few times I've been in there I've always tipped over 20% so I got a little upset to say the least.  But it gets better....  We leave to go somewhere else and then eventually end up at a bar down the street. Low and behold there are some employees wearing their BWW uniforms and one of them starts screaming and yelling at me across the bar that he's going to kick my a** and everything else because some person that I happened to talk to did not pay his tab and I was responsible for it???  What fun.....  Needless to say, I'll NEVER, EVER go back to this particular Buffalo Wild Wings. Too many other bars in Las Vegas to waste my time and money where the employees understand service and taking care of people. Especially customers that plop money into the machines.  I prefer to rave about good service / places but this negative review is certainly well deserved. Not just because of the above incident but from my experience, the bartenders there on swing shift seem to be miserable every time I've been there, rarely smile and their customer service skills are shoddy compared to other places I go.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"The good: Friendly waiters.  The bad: Slow service, smells a bit funny inside, cold dry overcooked vege burger, small portions, have to pay for every tiny add on, they got my custom burger wrong.  This place I'd say is okay, but there are definitely better options around"}
{"text":"I ate here about a year ago and remembered that the food was just ok.  I previously ordered the popcorn shrimp and the wedge potatoes and like I said before, it was just ok.  Well, today, my co-worker was raving about the boneless wings and the sauce and I decided to give it another try.  I ordered the boneless wings with honey bbq sauce and onion rings. Both were delicious.    I would recommend ordering ahead, since I waited 20 minutes for my food.  At least you know that its made to order and not sitting under a heat lamp somewhere."}
{"text":"I must have been to this place over 50 times since I've lived in Vegas. It was almost a weekly ritual for me. It sucks to leave such a bad review, but my blood was boiling after what happened to me last night.   I manage a team of over-night workers in North Vegas and I wanted to buy them all lunch. I called in a large to-go order at about 11pm on 6-11-2017. The person on the phone was very helpful and got my order going. When I showed up, there were a few people outside of the front door waiting to get in. We all buzzed the door and called the phone number, but no one came to open the door. The other customers ended up leaving, but I couldn't because I had placed my order already and didn't want to walk out on food that they already prepared for me. 20 minutes go by and I'm still outside in the wind and cold, seemingly being ignored by the 4-5 people working at the time. I decided to knock on the side door in the smoking patio area. Still nothing....   That is until one of the workers decides to angrily confront me. He told me that the patio entrance is not the entrance and then raised his voice telling me to leave the premises \"NOW\" I wanted to explain to him that I had an order that was already placed, but he kept cutting me off and yelling at me to \"LEAVE NOW\". I don't think I've been so infuriated at a business and it's employees in my life.   I called the business number after the employee went back inside and asked to speak to a manager. The person on the other line literally hung up on me. OMG!!!  I called again about 5 minutes later and finally spoke with someone who knew what I was there to do. I was finally let in and given my food. I was apologized to several times by what seemed to be the supervisor or shift lead. The server who told me off outside didn't have the guts to even look at me. Coward.   I've been a manager for most of my professional life and I know garbage when I see it. It's not the rude employees fault for being the way he is. It's the managers fault for hiring him. That guy should be unloading trucks or sweeping floors, not serving customers.   I love this place, but I swear on everything that I love that I will NEVER return here again. I will also NEVER use this business to cater events for my employees."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Expect it to be busy on their Tuesday/Thursday wing specials. Not the biggest dining room and parking can be frustrating. The food is really good though. I'd recommend their Parmesan Garlic wings and iced tea! Or Nacho Burger!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I both got food poisoning from here :( I loved Buffalo Wild Wings & it was my favorite spot for years but after getting that sick I won't be back. The server we had was great! It's just not worth spending 14 hours sick after eating & almost going to the er for."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Entire family found something they liked.  Wings, wraps, burgers and more.  Will return."}
{"text":"The customer service continues to get worse here at Pearl Road. I have been ordering wings here for a few years on wing tuesdays. Now they will not allow you to order them cooked well done, unless you buy them on a normal night and pay $1 a wing! What a joke!! They undercook there wings to begin with so you need to order them well done. Make sure you count your wings on tuesday also, they tend to give you less than the number you order. They lost this long time customer !!"}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. Waited to be seated for about 10 minutes on a saturday afternoon. The restaurant was not busy and couldn't locate the hostess anywhere. Finally got seated and waited to order drinks and it took awhile. It took even longer to order our food since they seemed confused about who was suppose to wait on us. Not to mention the food even took much longer and we only ordered chicken wings. Can't believe this place! Will not come here again. If you have a lot of time to waste then this is the place for you, if not, go elsewhere. I only gave a two stars is because our waiter was nice."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst Buffalo Wild Wings location I have been to. I've tried and tried again to come here (over 5 times) to see if the service gets better, and it doesn't. I love the food do not get me wrong, but that is the only thing that has me coming back to this location. When you first walk in, it is mostly busy, but even when it is not, the Hostess just stares at you and doesn't say anything. I sat there the first time and 3 people walked in after me and were seated while I wasn't. I finally went up to them and told them and all they did was say \"Okay\" and we had to wait to be seated. I usually brush this off but after we were seated, we didn't get drinks and had to ask to order and flag someone down after 10-15 minutes. After we got our food, which took a while but I didn't mind, we wait 30 minutes after we had asked for the check and To-go boxes over 5 times. The check came, and the to-go boxes never did. After 2 more times of asking, we gave up and left. I still left tip thinking they were just understaffed. As we were leaving, I saw 5 girl workers standing in the corner just talking while it was crazy busy. Then, their manager came out and they all split up pretending to work. I left very annoyed and this was just one experience. I have had 4 other bad experiences at this location which finally put me over the edge to write a review and never go there again. I normally do not give places one star reviews because I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but after this many times, there is obviously a bigger problem. The service."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. We sat at a table in the bar area. No one came to our table for 5 minutes. We had to raise our hand to get service. Tera didn't introduce herself. We had to ask her for her name. We had to wait over 20 minutes for our food (Naked chicked and lepper pepper wings). When we finally got our food, the fries were luke warm and the wings were over cooked. The manager Todd came over and asked what was wrong. The only he did was bring us fresh fries and asked how the wings were. He never apologized nor did give us any dicount for our inconvenience. Never coming here again! Place was very noisey and cold. Very dirty in dining area and restrooms.  0 stars but i have to post 1."}
{"text":"Me and a select group of friends come here every single Tuesday for \"Traditional Tuesday\" where they have 60 cent wings. (We call it Wang Tuesday.) I feel it's the best day of the week. The atmosphere with all the sports on, which is always my favorite sports, and the friendly demeanor of the waiters/waitresses is very impressive! They always remember my group, and how we prefer a booth over a table, and our beverage orders. Heather specifically is very kind and funny, but that seems to be the personality of everyone there.  I always get the Huckleberry lemonade, and I actually don't know what it's supposed to taste like, because it always tastes different to me, but it's still a sweet yummy beverage nonetheless.  As for the wings, I usually get either salt and vinegar or lemon pepper, which go fantastically together, but when I try other wings (mild, Caribbean jerk, etc.) I've never tasted one that was less than great. They have so many different flavors it's hard to pick!  All in all, no matter what kind of week I'm having, I can count on the welcoming crew at bdubs to make it a little better."}
{"text":"Inexperienced wait staff that lacks knowledge on customer service. Food lacks flavor for the price. Numerous wing sauce to chose from not 1 i find impressed me."}
{"text":"Good place to come watch some football have some wings maybe a few drinks and enjoy the game."}
{"text":"I hate this particular restaurant. I was there three years ago and they nickel and dime'd me then and they're doing it still now. The service is awful, they have their own set of rules that are different from ALL OTHER BW3's I've been at, and it takes forever to get anything. I walked out before and I did it again recently. Awful. Horrible. Worst restaurant I have ever been.  They wouldn't let me have a tall Great Lakes Christmas Ale because the waitress said \"Its too potent.' Then I over heard a waiter ask the manager why they can't sell the large Christmas Ales and he said \"Because its 75 cents more and we make more money this way.\" Smart as a business option that is, they are the ONLY BW3's  WHO DO THAT.  Every time my glass was empty I had to scream down the bartender who was too busy talking to all his buddies instead of helping the other bartender who was taking care of tables behind the bar.  I tried to order some wings, but I could only get batches of 6 when I have been able to get batches of 5 at EVERY OTHER BW3's on their Boneless and Regular wing nights. Plus, for them to be 'wet' (saucier) would cost me extra. Bleu cheese? Extra. Celery? EXTRA.  Do not support this monstrosity of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Came to pick up my food and walked up to the host and said I was picking up food. She then pointed and rolled her eyes. Was super annoyed and didn't want to be working. Then I sat down and waited for my food and she didn't talk to anyone who walked in the door. Just grabbed menus and walked to a table. Wings were good. Fucking expensive!!!! Get the bone in extra crispy. Yum. We will be back. But not often."}
{"text":"I try enjoy their food, and their drinks are good as well. You should totally try their cherry mojito, it's great.  Unfortunately, their service is awful. I went there with some friends tonight and the experience left a horrible taste in my mouth. Our server was impossible to understand, she kept talking to us in a combination of mumbling and slurring so we got about every fourth word. She took forever to do anything; one of my friends ordered a beer and it took 20 minutes.  Our food took twice as long, the order was incomplete and we kept having to ask for the rest of it. It them took 15 minutes to get our check and to get a to go box.  Overall, I think we'll try another spot for wings next time, bad service will always win over good food."}
{"text":"When you're in the mood to watch some sports and eat some hot wings you can't really do better in surprise. It's a chain and thus it tastes like every other location, but it fulfills it's purpose well and is slightly above average in this way."}
{"text":"WARNING CREDIT CARD FRAUD - This was our first time dining at a Buffalo Wild Wings and could not believe how awful our service was. The waitress was never around, drinks not refilled,  we had our basket of fries come out after we finished our dinner and staff was not friendly all. The service was so bad that I wrote a note on the receipt how awful the service was and this was the first time in my life I was not leaving a tip. Normally I tip 20% + because I have waited tables and know what's it's all about. The unbelievable thing was when I received my credit card statement I say that the waitress added a $4 tip to my receipt! When I called to speak to a manager there was no sincere apologies bit I was  told that my $4 would be credited to my card. This was theft and fraud and I warn everyone to check your receipt if you still choose to dine here. Fyi- emailed my experience to the corporate office and received no response from them. Truly the worst dining experience I have ever had!"}
{"text":"So great service. My pulled pork sandwich and fries were not hot but the front of the house manager and our server went above and beyond. They comped everything plus gave us 4 gift cards! Yay! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The whole place seems filthy and sticky and smells like dirty bathrooms. It's like a nasty chuck e cheese but for bros. The food is so overpriced too and just not very good. I left feeling sick and like I needed to take a shower in antibacterial soap. Two stars because the servers were okay and I don't think it's their fault this place is gross, sorry ladies."}
{"text":"We had lunch there.  It wasn't busy but it took a long time to get our food. We told the waitress we were in a hurry. It wasn't her fault that the food took so long. We had a chicken wrap. The chicken was dry. We learned that the chicken is pre-cooked and kept under heating lamps all day.  The manager reduced the bill, but this is the last visit for us."}
{"text":"Good cold beer but pricy.. Total bill $30 for 2 beers, Morningstar Farms black bean burger and frozen French fries. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Worst experience I ever had. It took 25 minutes to get a drink and our food was cold. Horrible service as well. They complained their manager was horrible."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours ! With a great happy hour! The cheese sticks were great... we got them for  $4 during happy hour..service was great and this place is huge. You get a lot of food for your money."}
{"text":"Pretty bad service . Waited 10 minutes for a server that never showed, finally went to the bar and brought drinks back to our table. Server finally showed up 10 minutes later and gave attitude because we snagged the first round from the bar. Server never returned, bought the rest of the drinks and food from the bar.   Food is decent, its wings and fried stuff. Fifteen years ago bw3 was the place to go. Now there are so many other better options. Hit up winking lizard, quaker steak or even the Boneyard further down mayfield.   This location is newly remodeled. It doesn't matter, it's still a hole with employees who act like you are inconveniencing them because you sat down."}
{"text":"We stopped here the other night after the movies for a quick bite. We sat at the bar, expecting faster service. I am pretty sure the bar tender has worked there for several years; but I don't know how she has managed to keep her job because her service was absolutely horrible. At first she ignored us and waited on what I would assume was a regular. Luckily we were finally acknowledged, and she was about as friendly as a post. I ordered a beer and Dave a glass a wine. She had no wine knowledge, which was very apparent.   On top of the crappy service came the same mediocre food we have come to expect from chain restaurants - if it isn't deep fried and smothered in sauce - then it comes from a bag and has no flavor. We had chicken wings, of course there was hardley any meat on the wings and we asked for Blue Cheese. We got one ranch and one blue cheese.  I am not sure what she didn't understand about the statement, \"I am from NY, I want blue cheese, not ranch.\"  But then again...  Will I come back - probably not. I can go to other chain restaurants for the same mediocre food with way better service."}

It was EXTREMELY crowded, in fact, we got the last available table and throughout the visit there was standing room only. This would lead you to believe that the food is really amazing, NOT the case! I ordered the nachos and had to give them away due to the fact that they were sooo bad! I literally could have gone ANYWHERE ELSE and gotten better. They were so bad that my buddy could not eat them and ended up taking them home to his wife (he's probably still sleeping on the couch) lol.  I also had two different types of wings that were OK, but nothing to brag about. I just liked the many choices of flavor. The service was Excellent so I am leaving 2 stars.. I also really enjoyed the beer and my team won! I was very pleasantly surprised at the customer service considering the place was so Jammed. I have been to so many other places that weren't at all busy and the service was HORRIBLE! They get an A for effort as my beer was never empty.. If you go here STAY AWAY from the NACHOS!"}
{"text":"Jamie was an awesome server and Captain Jake brought us samples of beer and mixed sauces. Best wild wings!!!!"}
{"text":"BWW's is a place I always want to go. When the food is fresh and accurate you can forgive the place's natural shortfalls. The problem is that this location is possibly the worst run BWW's I've ever been to.  Not once, not twice, but THREE times I've been burned by terrible service and disgustingly cold food. I've come back because other franchises have proved that the formula is workable. I had one good lunch experience a couple months ago, but as far as I'm concerned this place is dead to me. There are multiple places within 3 blocks that can do wings but cheaper and without sullen, lazy servers.  Not only that, but there's a guy with a pic of their wings who's left not one but two 5-star reviews and nothing else? Give me a break. Get it together, Yelp."}
{"text":"45-cent Wings Night every Tuesday: That's the only time we go there. And the only food we would: bone-in wings (we tried their breaded...mehhhh, a little too \"synthetic\" tasting) and their potato wedges.  Their potato wedges are just the perfect size... one biters! And they are crunchy outside but soft inside...delish.  The only flavours that set them apart from the other wing places are the Mango Habanero and Asian Zing. Other than that, their wings are just about the same as the other places.   A special shout-out to the Asian-American server who works there. He is definitely the NICEST and most helpful BWW server in the Valley. Give him a raise or a promotion!  Oh, and lastly, $1.20 for two little dinky containers of ranch on Tues? Come on, for that price I could get a biggle bottle of ranch from Fry's and feed the whole table AND take it home."}
{"text":"BEST BUFFALO WILD WINGS EVER. Super nice bathrooms too, they are located under the Coors Light sign by the front entrance :)"}
{"text":"New place in Vaughan,  first of all this place is loud very so much so you cannot have a conversation with someone sitting next to you. The food is  simple and overpriced.  This is not a family restaurant at all.  I will not be back.  When I have a cravin for beer and wings I will go back to my fav st.louis wings on Jane st."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. It's close, the kids like it, I like the food. I can even tolerate the stupid anti - 2nd amendment thing. What I can't do is go to an Arizona sports bar that consistently has the AZ teams relegated to the distant corner screens. Sometimes they will switch it, sometimes they won't.  I am here once a week - sometimes with just me and my 16yr old son, sometimes all 6 of the family. $50 to $150 every week.  One more chance, then I find somewhere else. It's AZ - I love it here. Show the local teams first and foremost. Out of town games should be the ones relegated to the far away TV's."}
{"text":"The food was only okay. I had appetizers: boneless wings and slammers etc. The meat on the slammers were flavorless. The options on sauces were a plus. The service was not great. Our waitress was not attentive and took long to check us out. I never complain to managers about waiters but I actually contemplated this one. The service alone was not enough to make me return."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The service and food, top to bottom is the worst. I feel sick from eating there. It's greasy and disgusting food and the terrible service all together deserves 1 star only because I couldn't give zero. Do yourself a favor and don't eat there."}
{"text":"Great service!  We were in a hurry to catch a plane and conveyed that to the hostess and waitress so we got speedy service.  The wings and drinks were good but a bit pricier than I expected."}
{"text":"Wasn't even busy and had the worst service by the waitress named Phoenix- no joke.  Took forever to get refills, messed up orders in several different ways. Will def never go back to that that location, and prob avoid going to bdubs altogether"}
{"text":"Can't believe I never reviewed this particular B Dubs! Being right across the street from my work, I spent many lunch hours here eating Buffalitos or wings, playing trivia and catching up on the previous night's games.  Quite a few Sundays as well since I'm a Bears fan, and my girlfriend loves the Steelers, so we had to end up somewhere we could both catch our games.  Love the Buffalitos! They are tacos, except with grilled chicken and your favorite wing sauce! I usually went with hot, but you almost couldn't go wrong with any flavor.  Served with chips and salsa, it made a great lunch when you didn't feel like gettin messy with the wings.  Now that I have moved to the Chicago area, I'm really gonna miss this place.  Good thing there are B Dubs all over around here as well!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't very good, service wasn't very good. All in all a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"They have a really good veggie burger and I loved their roasted garlic mushrooms! I did not like their fried pickles though since it was very salty and just didn't taste good."}
{"text":"Wanted to mention that this location is run by great team of managers and customer service is great. Manager Connie is truly a class act... Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Food is \"meh\" however love the bar, reasonably priced drinks AND they show the UFC fights. Fun environment and the bartenders are friendly."}
{"text":"After a few fellow New Yorkers raved about how good Buffalo Wild Wings is, my friends and I decided to give this location a shot.   Service was mediocre, to say the least.   We ordered one batch of wings, side wings and two salads (lesson learned - never order a salad at a wing place).  Our food took over 25-30 min to come because there was an event in the bar. Last time I checked, a restaurant should be able to manage an event and its regular customers - without playing favourites.   Once the food did arrive, the orders were completely messed up. We received two side orders of wings, a wrong salad and missing parts to our meals. By the time our orders were fixed, we were shocked to see how incredibly sad looking and small the wings were. The 'blackened chicken' salad was inedible - the manager claims that its supposed to be overseasoned. If by overseasoned he means salty to the point you feel like you're eating pure salt...they need to reconsider their recipe altogether.   Management ended up giving us the main courses for free and we left paying for one side order of wings and drinks.   Long story short - NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN!  To all you wing lovers, try Duffs Wings, St. Louis, All Stars, Big Bone Wings or really just anything else."}
{"text":"I normally love Buffalo wild wings. Tonight I switched up my usual order and decided on a salad. The food was very disappointing. There were only 4 slices on chicken on the salad. I do not think it was cooked fresh... It was rubbery, difficult to cut and hard to chew. Very unhappy. I will not return to this location.  Bright side is the service was great!!!"}
{"text":"Love this Buffalo Wild Wings! I get a take out order for co workers and myself once a week and it's always delicious!  Definitely stop by if you're at the mall shopping and looking for some tasty, great priced food!  Their honey bbq sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"This is an ok sports bar. Lots of TV's viewable from any seat.  If go there stick to chicken wings, burgers and salads are terrible. Old Lettuce and a dry processed burger. Our waitress was trying so hard to be cute that she forgot to be a waitress. Remember, stick to beer and chicken wings."}
{"text":"Love Buffalo Wild wings, but not this location. Went there with my boyfriend and his friend and a server took us to our table and it took them 10-15 min to get someone  aka the manager over to our table to greet us and give us all water and get our drink order. I normally get the honey bbq wings and when they came out they had absloutely no sauce on them. never will go back here again, kinda disappointed cause its close to home."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews at all...but I went to this place with my family...however I got a strawberry virgin daiquiri because im 9 months pregnant...i ended up swallowing glass that was blended in the drink with the ice...a manager came over not acting too concerned...I explained to the waitress and she stated this was the second time it happened to her...while the manager lied and said this is the first time this has happened at this location...the only thing they did was took the drink off...I will never eat here again...that can very well get into my babies system!"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger with blue cheese, he brought the wrong burger. Had to wait at least 15 minutes more...  No one was offered a pop refill or asked how their food was.  An apology wasn't offered for the delay or any compensation."}
{"text":"Went there last night. Ordered the boneless wings as appetizer.  They took 30 min to arrive and arrived the same time as the burger we ordered.  Food was Luke warm after waiting so long. The waitress was not concerned.  We won't be back.  This place needs some management that pays attention to what's going on."}
{"text":"Tried calling in a order and was on hold for 15 min. Called back 10 times and line was busy. FAIL FAIL FAIL"}
{"text":"SUCH atrocious customer service. It's a shame because their wings can be good... Sometimes. But this place is just completely substandard. Wish another Wing Zone would open up in my area."}
{"text":"This BWW is easily the worst in town.  Went for Thursday night football and the bar was packed. Good atmosphere is great... 2 inexperienced waitresses = AWFUL.   The service was terrible, the computers have gone down the last two times I've come here and it literally takes 2 hours for them to hand write your check.  You want forks? Ranch? Another beer? Expect to get up and ask one of the 16 yr old staff members.  Lets face it... If you want good bar food for far less money, go to Timbers."}
{"text":"I was there Sunday night around 12 the place was almost empty few people I order Chicken wings and wait 40 minutes to the wings came out   And the service slow and I don't wait cuz the place was empty."}
{"text":"I love BWW for the plenty options I get in wings. But when ever I do a call in order some how they miss something or the other, today they missed giving me carrots n celery which would have made my wings taste more better."}
{"text":"So I ordered 80 wings they put all the sauce on the side but they literally only gave me 3 sauces and they weren't even the right sauces! What the heck am I going to do with 3 sauces? Let alone the wrong ones? I called them to let them the know the manager didn't even care about my problem! Basically she said their is nothing she will do about it. I was so upset because I really had wanted buffalo wild wings for a long time and I finally convinced my husband to go back there and we didn't even get the right stuff! Never will go back!"}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon, I decided to make a stop at Buffalo Wild Wings. I walked into a fairly crowded restaurant with an empty stomach. There were several games on TV during the time of the visit - the reason for the crowdedness. Despite the seemingly busy restaurant, we were seated quickly. The chicken tenders I ordered were above average for tenders and the fries were also pretty good. The waitress frequented our table often, which was a plus. Overall a quality visit."}
{"text":"Manager was very accommodating, despite the fact that I called the day before to book a family gathering for my mom and dad for about 16 people.  I booked for a Tuesday lunch before my dad had to have his procedure done on Thursday so that he could have something in his belly before his 24 hour fasting.  They were pretty packed for lunch but still managed to fit us in."}
{"text":"DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS BUFFALO WILD WINGS!  I am amazed that after spending $60 gambling (in 30 min) that I wasn't comp'ed 2 miller lites... and they weren't even the big ones.  I don't expect my food to be comp'ed, but 2 drinks?  They made $60 extra bucks off of me... why not just comp 2 beers?  I also ate, so I expected a bill, but lo and behold... 9 extra dollars on the tab.  Well, that's a nice way to get your customers to think twice about tipping their bartenders!"}
{"text":"We are BWW regulars (the one at the Galleria Mall) and love that place. Tried this once before and wasn't impressed- this visit is the same. Got drinks and appetizers quickly but our food order took awhile. Place wasn't crowded so not sure what took so long. Sorry we cheated on our regular BWW's"}
{"text":"Customer service is very lackluster.  We got our food before we got our water.  Food was good though."}
{"text":"went on a non busy monday night, server was not familiar with menu, I asked for no spicy or hot sauce on my tacos,waited 25 mins. for them and did not get them how I wanted, sent back and waited another 25 min. for the correction, the people I was with had to wait for  me to finish.  will not go there again."}
{"text":"Called in for a pick up and when I got there, they had no record of my order. At first I was a little irritated, but the girl that helped me couldn't have been nicer. She was so kind and also gave me my drink for free. And to make the situation a little better, when I received my food I noticed that there were extra boneless wings inside. Then I asked for ranch and they gave me two for free as well. Very please with how they handled the situation. Mistakes do happen, but the way they handled it was just great to me."}
{"text":"I sat in a place where I could see into the kitchen a bit . First of all I see my basket of onion rings were up on the counter for ten minutes getting cold. Then the male server puts his bare hand in my basket and eats one of the onion rings and proceeds to bring the same basket to my table.  Then manager was very unhelpful. Will never go to sardis rd location again."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was God awful. Our server was the blonde girl with the tattoo behind her ear. She never came to check on us, said the kitchen never dropped my wings and that it'd take six more minutes. I never got my wings until maybe fifteen or twenty minutes later. We were waiting another twenty minutes for her to come back so we could ask for our check and some boxes. She was laughing up at the bar with other people, and said she completely forgot about us. Completely unprofessional and a waste of $40."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings typically has horrible service, so I wasn't expecting much. Our waiter/server was very friendly. Our drinks were never empty. Food came out fast. I've never been graced with that luxury at other Buffalo Wild Wings locations. Our order was messed up once, but it was fixed immediately. There's also double the amount of TV's on the wall than any location I've been to, so you don't have to ask to be seated in a certain spot, or constantly turn around to see the different games. Also has more seating than the other locations. If you are heading to Buffalo Wild Wings to catch a game, pick this one."}
{"text":"Horrible General Manager, horrible managers, horrible staff! Can care less about customer service. Never bring my money anywhere near this place ever again."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely terrible. I have yet to be corrected on this...Plan on waiting a long time to be greeted and plan on ordering right away...  Food is typical BWW so at least that's consistent! Love the cheese fries. I'll still continue to visit because it's in a great location but come on BWW get it together. You have the Winking Lizard to compete with."}
{"text":"Every time we come we leave satisfied! We get the same hostess Tara, every time we go and she is soooo sweet and friendly. The waitress's are always on their game, the place is clean and the food is always 100%. Tonight I had the Mediterranean salad and I'll be honest I never thought of getting a salad at a place like this just cause the chicken n burgers are always so tempting! But my salad was so amazing! My hubby had the nacho burger and our daughter got the buffalo blue cheese burger which has become their usuals! We love this place!"}
{"text":"The one big drawback to this location is the amount of children in the place.  I have never been there in the evening where the adult count exceeded the kid count.  And for the most part, the kids do run wild and unchecked.  That being said, I've never had a bad meal and the staff is pretty attentive.  I ordered take out one Friday night and when I went to pick up it was extremely busy; I gave them my name and by the look on the counter clerk's face, I knew something was wrong.  I was told that it would be just a 20 minute wait but I deferred, telling her it was OK and not a big deal.  So I went across the street to Taco Bell.  When I got home the phone rang and it was the BW Manager apologizing profusely and offering to deliver my order.  In the end extended $25 worth of free food on my next visit.  I thought it was a cool thing to do."}
{"text":"The waitress was rude to me for not even asking. That's what I put on receipt and left no tip.  Here at Buffalo Wild Wings (Chandler) to eat before movie.  Choose spot at bar to watch baseball game. While eating this old couple come in two stools over. So I'm eating and the channel was changed to golf. Now I watch golf but I was watching the game. Pissed me off wasn't even asked. She changed for old couple who came in 25 minutes after I did!!!! No tip for you!!! Plus it's the junior league, Web.com crap.  Cheese Burger was good"}
{"text":"Last time I was here (almost 2 years ago). The service sucked tried again. Now I remember why I stopped coming here. No service at the bar.  Why would you have seating around the bar an not have anyone service them.  I will never go back again.  last chance!"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing wings!! Garloc parm, Lemon pepper and mango habanero are so tasty. Tuesday wings are the best discount around .. We always look forward to date night once a month here."}
{"text":"Love the wings! Go for the spicy garlic, chipotle dry hub, and the hot."}
{"text":"Good wings.  But 3/4 of people want to watch and hear the sound of ufc....but they won't switch the sound till baseball over.... Or else I'd give them 5 stars.    Not coming back here to watch any sporting events"}
{"text":"Went to BWW last night, Saturday Oct 18th, for my hubby's birthday dinner. Our daughter picked the spot and hubby gave the okay due to the great food and amazing experience we had at the BWW off north ln prior. Well...our experience here was CRAP compared to their other location. Will NEVER go back here.  We had over a 30 min wait to sit, which was explainable for a Saturday night. Once we finally get sat  it takes about 10 mins to get our sodas, which was \"okay\" since the server did seem busy and took the time to acknowledge that she would be right with us. However the main complaint is once we ordered our food, 2  chicken meals and a burger it took over 45 mins to arrive, granted it was a Saturday it still should NEVER take this long to get food. Once it did arrive hubby's hamburger and fries were COLD, its one thing to wait long for food to come out hot but to come out cold is not okay. Finally the manager comes over and says he understands our frustration and offers to take his UNTOUCHED food off the bill as he takes his plate (um, ya think?) and gives us a 15% discount for the NEXT visit...wow.    Bottom line HORRIBLE customer service here and won't be going back."}
{"text":"This BWW is wack. Their service is the worst. I placed a picked order with Pablo and he said it would be ready in 25-30. Twenty minutes later he was calling me saying my order was ready. I said well you said 25-30 minutes 20 minutes ago. He says well it will coming out soon. I was like what? Because in the past they have said 20 minutes and I get there and wait another 20 minutes. I get there and ask the girl us this standard practice.....she gives the kanye shrug and keeps moving. I asked the lady next to her was she the manager, she said yes and kept it moving. I was like wow nobody gives a shit to answer my question. I got the manager's name, Melanie, and that's when she decided she wanted to pay attention. The service here is shitty. I WILL be going to Wing Stop next time!!"}
{"text":"The food at this location is usually decent, but if you're ordering for multiple people, or are ordering for take out, just expect your order to be totally screwed up.  I live right across the street, and have ordered fairly often. The gals on the phone taking your order are always so impatient, rushing you through things, barely paying attention. And then when you get there and point out all of the errors in their order, they act as if it is your fault, and that it's such a huge hassle for them to give you what you ordered.   Super frustrating when ordering for multiple people, with multiple flavors chosen to fit their palates.   Also, \"your order will be ready in 20 minutes!\" ALWAYS really means \"your order will be out in around 45 minutes, cold as hell, and with some boxes of wings drowning in sauce, and some with hardly any sauce at all\".   Try other locations, as others have said."}
{"text":"This has to be the fastest bww I have ever been to. 50 wings, all hot, all crispy, all in under 10 min."}
{"text":"Quest for Wing Perfection   In the mess of pizza delivery joints, dive bars, fast food drive-thrus, and chain restaurants, the search for a quality chicken wing can be arduous, fruitless, and downright frustrating at times. Something about delivering a high-grade hot wing poses a curveball to many respectable establishments. In the greater Phoenix area, restaurants that make an admirable chicken wing are few and far between. Buffalo Wild Wings stands out from the crowd in this age of chicken wing mediocrity as it provides customers with first-rate service, inviting atmosphere, delicious food, and most importantly the best chicken wings offered in the state. Whether it be a family gathering, business oriented lunch date, solo outing, or a meet-up spot to watch the game, Buffalo Wild Wings is always the right call. Food is not the only great thing at Buffalo Wild Wings, the service and atmosphere is awesome as well. Inside the restaurant you will find a friendly waitstaff ready to guide you on your American cuisine endeavor. Upon entering the restaurant I was greeted by a friendly hostess who quickly escorted me to a booth while handing me a menu and rattling off the daily specials. Shortly after being seated, our waiter arrived and introduced himself as James. With a quick greeting and friendly smile he took our drink orders and hustled off to fulfill them. Throughout the meal he was there to refill the beverages, grab sides of ranch, and drop off extra napkins. He even made a point to continuously check on my table and assist any others needs necessary. James provided the perfect balance of service without lingering or disrupting the ongoing conversation.  The surroundings in the restaurant are just as good as the food and service. The booth my girlfriend and I sat in was very comfortable and private, which was a pleasant surprise. From my seat I counted over 30 televisions I could watch comfortably, making Buffalo Wild Wings the perfect spot so settle down and watch the sporting event of your choosing. The great staff and impressive atmosphere make Buffalo Wild Wings a great place to relax and spend a couple hours inside.  When it came time to order my girlfriend and I chose to split an order of jalapeo poppers and a large order of wings. We elected to order half of the wings medium buffalo and half parmesan garlic. The poppers arrived relatively quickly and were very tasty indeed. The crisp breading coupled with the cheddar-stuffed jalapeno made for a flavorful combination that left me wanting more.  The poppers were a great way to start the meal off right and whet my appetite. When the star of the show arrived things seemed to get quiet for a moment as James set down the two heaping baskets of delicious chicken wings. The parmesan garlic wings had a creamy and rich flavor that reminded me of an Italian pasta dish. The parmesan garlic wings were very flavorful and a nice break when the heat of the medium buffalo became unbearable. The real star of the show, the medium buffalo wings, outshined all other aspects of the meal.  Making a truly great buffalo wing is quite the tall order. The perfect hot wing is an often replicated but rarely duplicated American classic that is appropriate for almost any occasion. An ideal buffalo wing has a tangy sauce with a nice amount of spice, but not a mind-blowing, taste bud incinerating level of heat. It has to be meaty and cooked to perfection, which means no dry or uncooked regions of the wing.  It must have a crispy outer coating without feeling like it was battered and deep-fried or drenched in flour.  Lastly, the wing must be sweet without leaving the consumer with a sugary aftertaste in their mouth like they just ate a piece of candy. I'm not sure if this was the criteria that Buffalo Wild Wings set forth to meet, but I do know their wings are all of these things and so much more. They are unquestionably the best wings I have ever eaten at a restaurant. I left Buffalo Wild Wings with a full stomach and feeling of content. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great place to enjoy some terrific food. Buffalo Wild Wings is truly one of my favorite restaurants in the valley and I plan on returning in the near future."}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience at this location. It was our first visit ever to Buffalo Wild Wings and we had heard such great things about the food and vibe there. The restaurant was packed but the front of the house manager said it was twenty minute wait, we figured ok not bad. I gave him my name and we proceeded outside to wait because the sitting area was crowded. We waited for about twenty minutes in 110 degree weather with a toddler in tow, my husband went inside to ask how much longer the wait would be, the hostess at the podium said we were next. Due to the heat we ventured inside to wait. We waited another ten minutes and I went up the front of the house manager and told him his hostess told us we were next and I just saw you pull up quite a few families before us. He asked me mine name and I pointed to it on his clipboard, there was my name in between about a dozen crossed off names...he skipped us! I think he realized what happened because he said \"we'll seat you right away at table 40\". To add insult to injury we were seated at a table directly next to the bathrooms...really! Not only did we skip and ignore you and your family, but here's the shittiest table for ya!!! Not a good first impression Centennial Buffalo Wild Wings! Needless to say we will probably not be going to that location again!"}
{"text":"Until they ban the men that left a waitress a note on the tab that \"she is worthless\" this business is worthless. This company should defend their employees in abusive situations. Instead, they fired her. A written warning or a day suspension for her getting upset would have been sufficient. Everyone has a breaking point! With social media things can be brought to the public's attention much greater. I hope the military base officers reprimand the soldiers responsible for making them look like fools"}
{"text":"Horrible service.   Took 10 mins to even get a host to acknowledge our family.  The once seated the service was very slow. What made it worse was after a mistake was made on one food order it took over 20 mins and it still wasn't corrected.  My entire family ate their dinner and I still didn't have mine.  We eventually decided to leave without getting the meal, without any discount or apology.  Had to even request to have the side I didn't eat removed from the bill  On a positive side - they do have game stations for the kids which really kept them entertained.   That said we won't be back"}
{"text":"Great wings and great atmosphere to watch the big game.  Their food, aside from their wings, is average and a little bland, though.  But who goes there for a great meal?  They go for a beer and some high definition sports watchin'."}
{"text":"This place serves great wings, I'd recommend the terriyaki sauce ones."}
{"text":"Went in for my lunch and Stefanie was the bartender. She was very fun  and remembered me from my last visit, I thought that was great! Good suggestions and samples of new beers I wouldn't have tried on my own, and I was impressed with her knowledge of the beers themselves. My food came out quick and accurate. I left very satisfied."}
{"text":"I went here tonight to watch the Kansas vs Western Kentucky game. I knew it would be busy so I showed up early and patiently waited for a high top in the bar since I was alone. After I got a table my waiter was right there but it took awhile to get my beer, at least he took my wing order. When he delivered my beer and wings he didn't come back till my glass was empty. It took 15 minutes to get my new beer. According to my waiter it was because the tap had bown, but I saw the bartender pouring the same beer.   As I am getting ready for the game I notice that the two big screens in the bar are on different games. Mind you I didn't expect both but 1 was on a lower seed game and the other was on a game that didn't star for 20 min. I asked for the channel to be changed and was told they don't change channels. I was shocked that a #1 team was going to only be on small TVs and started looking for my waiter to cash out, but he was nowhere to be found. Thankfully a nice waitress got me my tab but I had to go give it to my waiter. He took his own sweet time even though I was trying to leave to miss as little as the game as possible. He was a bad waiter and whoever the young girl in the white worker shirt was that said she wouldn't change the channel is an idiot.  They get two stars for 2 reasons: the waitress that helped me get out of there faster and the manager who valiantly tried to keep me there. By that time I was shocked, pissed and I had tabbed out but at least he tried. bad service, and idiotic game scheduling will keep me out of this location for a long while."}
{"text":"I was so excited when they opened a b dubs in the area and wow was I let down. The wings are good of course, but the service as never been good and we have tried coming back several times hoping it would improve. This last time was the worst we went for happy hour and 20mins past happy hour time was told we would still be charged full price because the computer wasnt showing happy hour yet. Okay I get that things happen, but then we received our order and no bowls no napkins I had to flag another server down. I didn't receive a single refill on my water and even asked my server. I just cant believe that in such a busy area you wouldn't be able to find a few good servers."}
{"text":"Went into this location around 11:00pm with a larger group of friends. Seating didn't take long because the place wasn't busy. Service was good. Ordered my food by building my own burger. I got chili on my burger and when it arrived, it looked like my chili had been sitting out all day long. Looked like it had dried a bit. However to the lack of my better judgement I still ate the burger. Well, I'm sick this morning and I believe it is all out of my system by now. Not returning to this location."}
{"text":"horrible restaurant in the phoenix area, cassandra was the rudest waitress i had dealt with due to her giving us the wrong check with major attitude and obviously hates her job... a huge let down!!!"}
{"text":"The service was slow as molasses and the bar was dead... More servers in the place than customers..  Our server had extremely bad BO."}
{"text":"Nick is an AMAZING waiter! We enjoyed his company and hospitality. Constantly attentive and genuine. We'll definitely be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Normally I have to give BWW a good review, but today was another story.  I met a group of friends to watch the Cardinals play and to have lunch and libations.  I meet here regularly with a group of 6-10 friends and we usually experience good service.  Today, as usual, we had good service, but ther was a twist.  I THOUGT we were leaving and my ride wanted to run an errand, so I stayed behind with a couple of friends while the errand was completed.  Over the period of 1 1/2 hours, I ordered 3 beers.  When I requested my (2nd) check, I was charged for 5.  I informed the server of the discrepancy and was told that \"the video would be reviewed and my ordeer would be revised, if necessary\".  I was later advised that management didn't have time to review the video and that 2 beers had been \"comped\" and that from now on, I would have to \"pay as I go\".  Well, that's all fine and good...except that I only ordered 3 beers and I wasn't \"comped\" anything.  I asked to speak to the manager.  He showed up, was polite and cordial, but insisted that because I was the only one ordering Michelob Ultra (in the entire establishment), that I had ordered 5 and was being comped...further, he stated that \"we can't be comping beers for everyone, so you'll have to pay as you go from now on\".    I've been a BWW customer since 2009...this is the FIRST time this sort of thing has come up, so I'm hardly a scammer.  I would think they would take my record into account when making such judgements into account, but evidently not.  Our group participates in happy hours and sporting events on a regular basis and we enjoy an atmosphere where good service and value are are a must.  Moving forward, I will not be patronizing BWW for these activities."}
{"text":"Ok so I recently had some beers and food @ the bdubs in the north valley. To start and be fair that type of restaurant isn't exactly my place so to speak, but that's not saying my experience wasn't all that bad. Some friends of mine had planned on getting together to watch a basketball game, I did not expect the amount of people that were to be flooding the whole place!  I only waited about 20-25 minutes for a table for 5, which considering the flood of people in the restaurant was a not too unreasonable wait time considering. I waited in the bar area and ordered a beer from their descent sized draft beer selection. Being a strongly committed craft beer drinker, I was happy to see a few select drafts that I like, all of them being from local breweries.   Once my friends and I were seated, I naturally ordered a plate of different flavored wings, all really well tasting. The waitress was extremely helpful in making our experience there a good one, even turing up the volume on a closeby television, which we all I know in a crowded bar is asking alot."}
{"text":"Normally we like Buffalo Wild Wings for the atmosphere, sports, trivia etc. We went to BW3's on the East Side and were shooing flies and gnats from our food the entire time. After not being able to finish our food we told the manager about it and he said, \"yeah, we've been having a fly issue.\" We will not go back."}
{"text":"Terrible service! The food was below average and the service was atrocious! I've never experienced such poor service before. The entire establishment was filthy. Strongly recommend avoiding this location."}
{"text":"Too noisy...they are fighting over parking with Uhaul...menu isn't the best...but I finally after many request I got the Mgr to get Wifi for customers! Limited on what drinks they can make..mostly a beer joint for sports fans!"}
{"text":"Poor service...waitress needs to be more attentive to all customer instead of just the usual people. What does it take to get proper service here?"}
{"text":"I passed this place dozens of times before going in. From the outside it looked like just another fast food chicken place, boy was I wrong. The inside is much larger than the building's outer appearance with plenty of sit down tables and a decently stocked bar. They have a tasty menu of choice eatings for you to munch on as you enjoy your company or one of the many LCD screens. It has the feel of a sports bar that just happens to focus on wings...and do they have great wings. These are quality chicken wings with a good variety of sauces. The skinny little fries and my regular lemonade were great too. Our waitress was regularly checking on us and the prices were not unreasonable. I definitely recommend this place for a casual lunch or a fun night out. This may actually be a 5 star as far as chicken places, may be due to upgrade in the future."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. Where do I begin? As the owner of a restaurant I am willing to eat a huuuge shit sandwich before saying anything to anyone, but this place deserves to be noticed. Here's the jist of it. Food ,and drink orders took a long time to take, they came out reallly late (1 1/2 hr) it was brought to the attention of the GM \"Todd\" he could have cared less. I was really surprised that nothing was done to turn our bad experience around..... Nothing... We had a party of 23 ( including kids) so we were willing to accept a little bit of confusion, and wait time, but it was like they never worked in a restaurant before?? Too many options I Westgate to waste my money there again. That corporate GM is collecting his paycheck, and can give 2 shits about your customer service. I'll stick to the mom n pop joints that makes things right when they make a mistake"}
{"text":"Brian in the bar was awesome. Never forgot anything even though we know he was busy. Most of us work at yard house and we feel we got great service. We had a great time."}
{"text":"Will never go back again .... Happy Hour Boneless wings were awful, Garlic mushrooms were worse. Everyone in our group of 50+ guests agree not to come back. Our group, ranging from 50 to 70 people, usually spend a lot of money on drinks, appetizers, and dinner. We couldn't wait to get out. We crossed them off as potential venue for future Happy Hours."}
{"text":"Look I know a lot of people like this restaurant. I mean big screen TV. Big game. You can drink beer. Wings wings and wings. But to be honest with you I have a major concern about Buffalo Wild Wings. Its because I used to work there.  The people who serve those wings to you guys only make minimum wage.... That's wrong! Because they are doing a servers job along with a lot more responsibilities than just a normal waiter or waitress would. So, why in heck don't the customers think that the servers deserve tips? They not only bring your food to your table they also bus your table when you leave. And when the restaurant closes they act as janitorial staff. They also have so many more responsibilities than just what i mentioned. They are given no discount on food or drinks and no free meals or bonus pay of any type. They get no sick leave no vacation days and no personal days either. Please show these poor serves some respect and start tipping!  They are working really hard! And deserve some gratitude."}
{"text":"So the two-star rating on here says it all: Meh, I've experienced better. So true of the BBW in Tempe.  Everytime I go there it's practically empty - which I guess doesn't ALWAYS signify a bad establishment - but in this case I think it may.    The wing Tuesdays are nice and cheap, and as long as you're drinking domestic beers (crappy domestics...) then your bill won't be so high. I was really P-O'd when I found out that local beers didn't count as $3 domestics!!! Hello, Four Peaks is right down the road and you're gonna charge me 6.50 for a pint during HAPPY HOUR?!  Please.  Also, skip the boneless wings. They are just glorified, over breaded chicken nuggets. Ick."}
{"text":"Food, good!  Service, a lot better than it used to be. Price is over what it should be. Beer and liquor is over priced, and $15 for 15 wings is ridiculous."}
{"text":"My husband, friend and I visited BWW on Super Bowl and it was packed! We were able to get one of their last tables before the game began. The staff was so friendly and made great suggestions! Our servers were Cori and trainee Chris. They were great and we had lots of laughs! I have a medical issue with my stomach and Cori had no problems accommodating my needs. The food was actually pretty good for fried food. Cori and Chris were great checking on us and making superb recommendations. Wish we lived in the area, I could totally see us making this our local hang out. Until next year my friends..."}
{"text":"Thoroughly underwhelming. Overprice and tiny sized wings and portions. Slow service too. No idea how this franchise got so big given their sub mediocre offering."}
{"text":"This place gets worse by the day. There are two staff members who are AWESOME!  The foid is okay, usually cold. The management  (and I mean all the managers) are horrible.  Don't bother complaining because they don't give a crap and will do NOTHING to make it right. In addition,  don't fill out the survey on the receipt.  I come here 4-6 times a month. I have filled out all the surveys and when asked if I want someone to contact me, they dont!"}
{"text":"Went for a Wild Card NFL playoff game on a Saturday night with a friend. We both ordered beers, I got a Troegs (can't believe bw3 had such a non mainstream beer) and friend got an ipa. Server said friend had to get his beer in a sniffer due to its high abv. I got mine in a pint glass. Later we compare notes and figure out both our beers have the same abv. Not only did friend not get what he ordered, he got the wrong beer in a smaller glass, losing valuable liquid gold. He would have sent it back but our server was awol for quite awhile. Later on I ordered the garden something app with hummus. It was served w/o hummus and I was told it'd be out in 30 seconds. Then told they were out. Server looked shocked when I refused it. Thankfully they did have hot pretzels in stock. Bathroom was dirty. BW3 is America's super generic sports bar.  Also the place was filled with destitute Steeler fans and their terrible towels that they also use for hankeys."}
{"text":"Over the past few times I've been here the experience has taken a 180 the staff is great and the wings are finally what I expect. I'm happy I can enjoy some wings close to home again"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Tender salad with jerk and 2 italian dressings is a must have"}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere reliable to eat this particular afternoon. Half of our party needed to eat and run as they had an appointment. We walked in and the place wasn't very busy. Open tables everywhere. Great we thought, not busy we'll be in an out fairly quickly. Wrong! I walked in said hello to the woman behind the counter and told her a party of 9 plus a highchair. She quickly told me \"no they can help you over there.\" Not welcome or here let me show you where to go. More of you fool I don't deal with this, that's not my job.  So we go to the correct person. Two people actually. They acknowledge us and say just give us a minute to pull the tables together. Keep in mind the whole center of the dining room was nearly empty so we weren't waiting for customers to leave or anything to be bussed. Simply pulling the tables together and voila. There was 3 women up front but 2 stood and watched as their colleague tried to ready the tables. I believe the employee readying the table maybe have had some special needs or developmental delays and was being very particular about laying things out and perhaps taking longer than needed to arrange each menu in front of each chair. This wasn't the issue. I applaud this young woman for being out in the work force and taking pride in her job. However two of her colleagues stood there and just watched her. Didn't offer her any help to set the table as needed. They weren't busy. They were literally standing leaning against the wall and counter. This young lady setting the table walked around the table no less than 5 times adjusting and arranging. Then had to return to the podium to get the correct menu and menu inserts twice. Again the other 2 women stood and watched. We stood there 15 minutes waiting. Once we finally got to the table and waited on the waitress we realized there was no way the half of our party with an appointment would be able to eat in time. So they had to get up and leave.  This left the table with 6 people.  BWW had a menu insert for a 15 minute or less lunch or it's free. Of the 6 remaining 3 of us ordered off that minute. One of the younger girls in our party wanted to time the kitchen to see how they did. Innocent enough. 21 minutes roll around and finally the food came out.  The bill came and the 3 menu items that were suppose to be free were still on the bill. The waitress explained that the special wasn't valid on parties of 6 or bigger and we didn't ask her to bring it out before the 15 minutes. First of all the fine print reads 6 or less. So we met that requirement and you're going to tell me that I have to let You know that \"hey I ordered off the 15 minute lunch menu and yes that means I would like it in that time.\" It's not like this was our idea, this was the restaurants promotion. I shouldn't have to tell you hey I'm ordering off this special menu and yes I want it in 15 minutes? Now the waitress attempted to rectify the situation by asking if we wanted to see the manager. We declined but let her know we wouldn't be return customers. However that manger should've been at our table the second they knew we were displease. We let them know soon after we sat down that the reason half our party left was because it took 15 minutes to get a table in a half empty restaurant. And then when we had to ask why the promotion as advertised isn't applied and we're clearly annoyed, that manger should've come out without us needing to request them. She removed an appetizer from the bill and left it at that.  Super frustrated with the lack of team work and a manger without a back bone. Come to the table maybe explain your policy. Help us understand. Don't stay in the back as some mysterious person relaying messages through an employee.  Also the young lady came to the table to apologize. They must have let her knew we weren't pleased. It wasn't her fault, it was her lazy coworkers that couldn't be bothered to give her a hand.  Also on top of this the place was dirty. The tables had a film. They set up our larger table by combining a square table and 2 round tables. The round table had drop down sides so it could be square. One person in our party felt weird sitting back from the table and the rounded portion so she dropped the side of the table. Big mistake. We then knew why they left them in that odd configuration. They were to lazy to clean the tables in the first place. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Always a good place to meet up with friends for great tasting wings."}
{"text":"i've worked in the service industry for over a combined 10 years. i've never been told that i couldn't seat and eat at a table in a bar that servers food because i was only 20. last i knew, if you served food and had tables you could serve guests under 21. it's the same as a restaurant that servers beer. long as you're not a a bar and ordering food, you're ok. so for me to come in with my girlfriend and be denied service because she was 20 and me being over 21. we sat at a table, both ordered water to drink. you might want to put up a sign, no one under 21 after 11pm since your dining room closes then."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Buffalo  Wild Wings  I'm sad to report that the employees have decided to steal/short on food.  What happened you ask.     So I choose to order take out and ordered 20 wings and burger.   When I got home and divided up the food there wasn't enough to go around.    How disappointing.     Do I really have to count from now on or do you think owners will fix this issue.   How embarrassing it will be to count the wings at the restaurants.   Just think.      Four wings times sixty take out orders.    240 wings paid for but not delivered.     Is it worth losing customers."}
{"text":"Went for Tuesday lunch about 11:15, very few customers. No game was on, but TV volume was enough to rattle the windows. Asked the server to please reduce volume, he did, but manager turned it back up without a word to us. We ate quickly, paid, left, won't go back. What happened to 'the customer is king'?"}
{"text":"I went there on a saturday game night with a very large party (around 30 people) so I don't want to tarnish anyone's views without people knowing these details. I ordered the \"big jack daddy Burger with a side of sweet potato fries\" and the burger was absolutely delicious, the fries however tasted undercooked on the inside giving them a crispy outside but a soggy inside texture. I'd recommend that to any burger lover out there. My girlfriend ordered a double of wings flavoured in teriyaki and honey garlic (a double is priced for 2lb worth of wings, and we got actual wings... not the boneless). I'm not sure if it was the day of the week or the large party size but our wings were absolutely terrible. You only get 8 wings per single (so in our case we only got 16 wings)  and there was barely any sauce on them. If I wanted to eat wings like this I would have gone to the grocery store and picked up a box of compliments cardboard flavoured honey garlic. With taxes and tips in (15% tip) it rounded up to a $50 bill. For the kind of money I spent I should have been stuffed but I was still hungry.   On a positive note, their TV arrangement is fantastic. You can sit almost anywhere and get a comfortable view of the game. The ambient volume was perfect in my opinion. I was able to comfortably talk to anyone at my table without screaming to them (and remember this place was packed being a Saturday night game night). The service was really good, our waitress was friendly and on the ball when it came to drink refills.   Atmosphere 9/10 Service 9/10 Wings 3/10 Big jack daddy burger 9/10 Sweet potato Fries 5/10"}
{"text":"Best wings / just ok service ! But who needs the best service with wings so good . I stood at the door ten minutes no one stopped to greet me or help me order so I made my way to the back and the bartender was really nice and helpful so he made up for the service or lack there of . Long story short come for the wings if u want 5 star service go elsewhere but if u want good food and don't mind mediocre service from a sports bar then come here :)"}
{"text":"Terrible! Check out the first picture in my profile of staff and management standing around watching tv! Shameful lazy!  1. Slow service  2. Cold food (wings covered in cold sauce) (burgers and fries cold) burgers dry thin party terrible!  3. MANAGEMENT AWFUL - the two hours we were stuck at this horrible location we watched management along with several other staff just stand at the entrance area watching varies sports on TV. No help to staff - never checked on any tables. Clearly not managing the food coming out of the kitchen. Just standing there watching TV.   This is the second experience at this location and certainly the last. Place is not busy if you feel like sitting alone but that will not speed up service or quality of food.   Corporate compare your revenues to that of other locations. I'm sure the numbers match this poor review."}
{"text":"I wish I could score this as 4 or 5, but the lack of service keeps it at a 2. Enjoy the food and drinks, but get the feeling your a hassle to the staff."}
{"text":"Haven't been in in a long time, but BW3 still has it going on.  Only issue was a guy smoking at the bar.  Wings were great as usual and bartender (Jose?  Juan?) was friendly and taking care of everyone - bar and tables alike.  Also happy with beer selections, just wish they'd get Longboard Lager back again (though that was years ago!)"}
{"text":"If you have a special sauce promotion for a given amount of time, how are you going to just not have it anymore 2 weeks before the end date? We came here specifically for that sauce and it was unavailable. I love bdubs, but c'mon."}
{"text":"Talk about a great way to watch the game. Went to BWW to watch the World Cup and couldn't have asked for a better experience. TV's everywhere airing the World Cup in addition to key baseball games! Great service, wings and Beer! The waitress was extremely personable and fast, even with all the tables she had to wait on. The wings (boneless) were tasty, and the blue moon beer I had made t the perfect combo.  I recommend trying the fried pickles as an appetizer....on point!  -Joe"}
{"text":"Wanted to watch the Jays vs Yankees on a monday night during the pennant race. Had the sound on a preseason football game. Just another American chain and a no brains manager following the rules to the letter."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Ordered hot wings but they were way too hot. Atmoshohere was nice but place was packed and service took forever.   Not a big fan but not the worse place in the world either."}
{"text":"Well I don't typically drag my buddy places with me since he is not of legal drinking age yet, however, I wanted wings and a beer.   We went on an off time hour and the staff was more than friendly and quite easy on the eyes. ;)   Needless to say, the wings were great as usual, tons of tvs and no need of bumping into others. Our server wasn't very attentive and the drinks were a little on the polite side. I guess it pays to befriend the bartender!"}
{"text":"I have visited differnt bww in town and i could say this is the best one! Aaron is awesome he always makes sure our food comes out right and hes always attentive for anything we need, i would give this place more stars if i could!"}
{"text":"After a late night out, I decided to give this location one more try. As soon as I walked in, the bartender wasn't as friendly as bartenders at other locations. My friend and I sat down, and asked for waters. The bar tender just kind of sat them down. I started a conversation with him after about 3 minutes and asked how he was doing. He was in a very negative mood and explained to me that he was tired and was going to be working a very long shift soon.  After about 5 minutes he finally approached us and asked if we wanted to order food. I ordered buffalo Mac and cheese. There weren't many customers in at this point  (3 of us all together) so I didn't expect a 40 minute wait for buffalo Mac and cheese!!!!! When my food finally arrived  (after being ignored for 40 minutes with no words except \"your food should be ready soon\") my buffalo Mac and cheese was placed in front of me....without the chicken... The bartender was very unapologetic about the whole situation. I will NEVER come to this establishment again. This buffalo wild wings has TERRIBLE customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Heed the warnings: STAY AWAY. This by far sets the bar for worst food experience I've had in 2014.   This BDubs is close to my house on my way home from work so i figured I would treat myself to some wings. It appears that since my last time at a BDubs thy have changed the menu to a small, medium, large operation that costs infinitely more of your money for a nebulous amount of chicken.  Knowing this I waited for their $0.60 boneless night on Thursday and called in my order after I left work.   Upon arriving at the restaurant there was a crowd of people around the host podium and the take out counter.  After idling around for a few minutes I built up the courage to ask some of the other people standing their if they were in line for a table or in line to place an order. Most it seemed were waiting for a order but not all. Finally finding my way up to counter checking in with a handful of people to make sure I was not cutting in line I had made it to a register. Feeling a sense of accomplishment I stood there with a smile on my face and waited to be acknowledged by one of the 6 girls behind the counter. It never happened. I had to speak up. \"Excuse me, I'm here to pick up an order.\" Lo and behold one of the girls checked the computer, another assisted and confirmed- there was no order for Matt. As it turns out there were only 2 other orders in the computer (which makes me wonder if all those other people mingling around the counter had orders in their system too).   20 minutes later I had my order and feeling bad for the gals behind the counter who were clearly unprepared to perform their duties I thought I would kill em with kindness and thank them very much for their assistance and wished them a pleasant rest of the evening. They however found it appropriate to not even look up from the computer or acknowledge me for the second time that evening.   MEAL TIME- I brought my boneless wings home and opened up the boxes only to be utterly underwhelmed by both the size and sauce coverage. These wings more closely resembled tater tots than boneless wings. Dry. Cold. And nearly chickenless. What more can I possibly say than it was a total let down and feel that this trip marks the last time I'll ever patronize THIS Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Slow service, crowded, and pricey. It was not tasty, either.  Why people like this place?? There are so many better places to go in Vegas."}
{"text":"After just 2 visits, I'm done with this location! To- go meals were sloppy and wait time was much longer then what I was quoted. Both times felt like I was being an inconvenience going there. This place is just not well put back together."}
{"text":"Went to Buffalo Wings to watch Women's World Cup game. They changed the station on the TV near me so that it was on the station carrying the game.  Food was great.  But more importantly, my waitress Julia was super.  She kept my soda refills flowing.  I never had to ask for anything.  I can honestly say that I felt  \"cared for\"."}
{"text":"Why is that this place has the most incredibly incompetent servers. Don't lie and tell me the kitchen is backed up when three tables, including one with 19 people were sat, order taken, and food arrived, BEFORE ours. You forgot to enter it. Plain and simple. (Wo)man up and admit it. This place is horrible with service."}
{"text":"Went in tonight with my wife and 2 kids. Hostess seated us in the approximately 60% full restaurant area and gave us menu. We sat and watched the wait staff make multiple stops at other tables patiently waiting for someone to stop at our table. After 15 minutes without a single server acknowledging we decided it was enough. We politely got up and made our way back to the hostess stand and informed them that no one even stopped by the table let alone take a drink order or talk about food. The hostess response was \"Oh, OK\" and took our game boards and watched us walk out.  We got in our car and drove to another nearby restaurant for dinner. My wife and kids went in to get a table while I decided to call and talk to the manager to inform them of the opportunity for improvement in their dining area. The manager was nice and apologized and wished me a good evening after I told him we went to a different restaurant for dinner. 3 minutes later when I joined my family inside the they were seated and already had drinks for the table.   It's a pity. The previous visit to BWW with the family also resulted in us waiting an extended period of time for service after the initial order was taken which resulted in us not returning for months. Tonight we decided to give them another shot and received the same deplorable service. No idea on when/if we will return, which is a shame as I am a big fan of their Caribbean Jerk wings."}
{"text":"We came in at 10:30 and the guy at the front told us that the dinning room was closed but the bar was open. When we sat at the bar I realized I forgot my ID at home and the bartender told us that the dinning room wasn't closed til 11 but as a waitress myself I knew that if we sat in her section she'd have to stay later to take care of us. Our waitress Vanessa insisted that we stay and she didn't mind. She was so sweet and very attentive. It's rare to find servers that are still sincere even when they're so close to being off.   Too many people write bad reviews and not enough about that good and hardworking people. She even added military on our checks because she saw my bf's ID in his wallet when he opened it.  Vanessa is a good one!   She deserves some praise(:"}
{"text":"Not bad food, cold beers and a great happy hour. Nice bar to watch games at with the many tv's they have."}
{"text":"Symbolic of the rapid decline of this brand  You know a chain is in dire financial shape when the wait staff are berating you to order an appetizer before you've even settled in your chair.  The desperation hangs in the air.  If you've even glanced at a newspaper business section then you know that chicken prices have increased and that Buffalo Wild Wings management spend plenty of time moaning about it.  Oddly enough, you don't hear McDonald's management moaning about beef prices - they talk about ways to improve service and retain and/or attract customers.  BWW have decided to play three-card monte and change traditional, easy-to-understand order sizes of a half-dozen or a dozen wings to nonsensical quantities of 10 or 15.  The bartenders (I use the term loosely) were apparently suffering from some group form of ADHD.  I can confirm that they wear jersey #82 (the year of BWW founding) as a uniform because their backs were turned to me 90% of the time.  The rest of the time they were elsewhere, er, serving tables.  Hang on - isn't that what the numerous wait staff on duty are supposed to be doing?  The lonely beer drinker could only stare balefully at his empty glass while the bartenders were - no joke -busying themselves pouring glasses of ice water to serve to toddlers seated in the bar area.  Priorities!  I hear two year olds tip well!  The Rube Goldberg-esque insanity was unending.  Wait staff would deliver food to the end of the bar and the bartenders would take the trays to the table.  Why?!?!  Isn't this a misuse of both parties' time and a contradiction, considering the wait staff are already on the restaurant floor?  In addition to a beer, I ordered club soda.  I got ice water.  When I was asked if I wanted a refill,  I declined since they had failed the first time around.  The glass, only half-empty at that point, was snatched away and dumped, along with any thought of finishing it.  Printed, updated bar tabs are always kept in a small glass in front of the customer, therefore there is no need to ask for the check.  Knowing this, I placed my credit card on top of the tab in plain sight...where it sat for 15 full minutes, ignored as studiously as its owner.  Half the bar seats were empty on a Saturday evening i.e. peak hours.  Either people have given up on this location, on this chain, or both.  I've been a loyal customer in multiple states but experienced enough apathy in one night to put me off for good."}

Appreciate the managers gesture of offering chips & salsa.  Otherwise everything else was all good."}
{"text":"Good place to watch sports events and lots of tv screen only cons is they close at 1am."}
{"text":"I like the menu here. The food gets the three stars. There are better wings, burgers and beers in town, but BWW has trivia and lots of TVs. It's safe and comfortable, but by no means extraordinary.    The service here however, is terrible. I've sat in the restaurant and had no problems,  but if you're in the bar, I hope for your sake you know the bartender. Otherwise, you'll wait to be acknowledged, wait moee to order, wait longer to get your drinks and wait forever to get your food. Sorry I'm not a regular, but that's the reason why."}
{"text":"Very good! An American friend of mine took me to BWW down in Minneapolis once and I could not wait for the franchise to come here. When they opened I was not disappointed. The wings were great! The service friendly, markedly friendlier than other pubs I've been to in the city. Service has been slow on occasion but with customers stacked to the rafters it was in reason. Great for wing nights with the guys or if you want to catch the game and gorge on high sodium, high protein, deliciousness."}

{"text":"Rude ass bartender - \"Michelle\" We came in exhausted and tired from work (so to her we probably look like we were broke lol. ) She first asked if we wanted something to drink but we asked to order food first. After she served our food she did not check back and after those hot wings we were thirsty, and needed some more water. Throat was on fire and we were slurping on ice! I turned around to ask another server and as the other server brought the water back around to us, Michelle states \" OH! Now you want something?! \"  I was like \" uh we've been needing some water.\"  She says, \"Well YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED!\"  (Oh hell nah! Who are we suppose to ask?! It's not even busy around here.)   So, anyway she turns to the customers three seats away from us and has the nerve to talk crap about us in front of them!!   WTF DID WE DO? We just needed some water. She continued with the side eye. So I'll leave her a nice \"Tip\" : NEXT TIME INSTEAD OF TURNING TO THE LEFT TO TALK SHIT, just be more attentive to your customers.   Overall, food was BWW. SERVER was a beeotch. Lol"}
{"text":"Brought the family in for an early dinner. Mediocre at best experience.... Staff was on auto-pilot...drafts were warm (bc they sat at the bar for 3 minutes)....no flatware with dinner( hard to eat a salad this way... Salad was VERY old and wilted....see posted pic....  Mediocre experience and gross food. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Very bad service, had to wait an hour and 30 minutes to get my food after i order. The waiter was very rude."}
{"text":"back when buffalo, roamed this land before cowboys & Indians the west back then, was truly wild open range, mile after mile that's when, I guess, buffalo had wings long before the hooters' thing and i thought them, long extinct at least that's what most folks would think but on the outskirts, all around the mesa, gilbert, chandler towns buffalo with wild wings those feathered, furry, horny things started landing in strip centers along with all the other renters cookie cutter, propagate i don't dig, this kind of place suppose, for some, they're a-ok just glad they build them far away from my house, they're not my thing bacon burgers, wings and rings fried mozzarella....everything  next generation, burger kings run of the mill, you know the game jilly's, chilis, all the same sysco truck stops, drops food off  thaw 'em out and heat em up served in baskets, side of fries and that, i guess, the reason why i'm glad that you are out that way with all the other 'burban chains and all this time, thought you extinct brought back i guess, from the brink outskirts of phoenix,  it's all good just please don't put one, in my 'hood"}
{"text":"Great service good people our server was Dave on top of his game would definetley recommend COMING to this BDUBS great service even on a traditional wing day .... Always a great experience and the food is fast and always perfect from my point if view ......"}
{"text":"Used to come a couple times a week; they're losing me. Today ordered chips/queso at the bar; comes out with about a third stale chips and lukewarm cheese.  Bartender takes it back, comes out better but still pretty lukewarm. Amount of chips was okay but not enough queso, took the chance and reordered and out comes the original problem again, you literally roll some of the chips they were so soggy on the bottom.  To compound the ridiculousness, I get charged 6.95 (something like that) twice when my recollection, in fact experience, was refills were only a buck or two. This store has deteriorated alot in the last year, I've heard it from ppl I work with who used to gotthere - and today's experience has shown them to be right.  Staff are nice but there are other places to go and BW3 doesn't seem to care."}
{"text":"One star because i had to give a star. Walked in, was seated outside...looked through the menu (which took no more than 10 minutes ) Thats it! No one came to take our order...the waitress helped a group of people and didnt even acknowledge us. After waiting 40 minutes we decided to leave."}
{"text":"So... the boyfriend decided we could splurge on the healthy eating plan and hit up buffalo wild wings.  Apparently he had a hankering for COMFORT FOOD. Normally when we go to this location we get RODNEY as our server. We really enjoy him as he is funny, and makes sure that our orders are perfect.  We have had poor service in the past but .. that is in the past.  This particular evening we had a different server and she was nice .. Refills were prompt and we got our Nachos first.  It was a big portion and completely yummy.  The chips are really fresh and they top them with queso, chili , lettuce , pico... so good. She brought us extra sour cream and salsa which was nice. We also ordered some garlic parm wings traditional bone in extra crispy ... we got them extra saucy rather than extra crispy . but no matter it was still delicious. I took one star away for the mishap .. but notice still 4 stars. Really really good. But next time we will make sure that we get Rodney. He really is the best server and he actually seems to enjoy his job. Which is a bonus :)"}
{"text":"Ate here today for the first time. They have happy hour at 2 which is nice! The service was okay.. Could have been better. But the food was fantastic! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The service has been inconsistent. Last week we went there and we were absolutely disappointed. We were seated on a table and for 20 minutes nobody looked at us. We got our own drinks at the bar after waiting for 20 minutes. Then we waited for another 15 minutes to order food. Then we stopped a waitress to help us to order food. She helped us to order food but it took another 15 minutes to arrive and she never showed up again for a long long time. We didn't get water, plates or napkins. We went and got our own drinks at the bar again. We got napkins from the bar.  There were very few people in the restaurant and the service is completely unacceptable!!. There was no manager on duty or the manager was watching a game probably with some drinks.  The waitress show up when it is time for check. She told us that we don't need to pay for drinks and she apologized us for poor service. We paid the check and ready to leave then the Bartender came with a check and our main waitress vanished. There was no training or minimal training provided to the staff here. Come on BWLD you can do much better. I have experienced much better service before here. I am giving 2 stars for the service I got previously but for this service I give zero stars."}
{"text":"Disgusting! One word sums up the quality of this place.... I seldom write reviews unless I truly feel it's needed for better or worse. Do not eat here the place is filthy. As we walked it every table and not even joking when j say EVERY table had food and trash on it... The floor was trashed and when walking by the kitchen area I looked in (open view when walking to table)  it was no better... I tried to find a health card to see this locations rating but sure enough it wasn't posted. When I told the manager she seems to brush it off... We didn't even order or sit down once we got to the table because food was all over our seats.... So can't say much on the food. Hope it's better then the hygiene of this place"}
{"text":"Hm well. Hubbs & I came in a couple of weeks ago because I had a gift card. We were seated fairly quickly but it took about 10 min or more for someone to come and take our drink order. Seemed like the staff was more interested in chit-chatting and giggling than actually working. The food was pretty disappointing. I ordered asian zing boneless wings which seemed to be banquet popcorn chicken rolled around in a little bit of sauce. They were very dry like a teenager left them in the oven too long. They brought my food out in very small little paper baskets, like really? You couldn't put both the wings and the fries in one larger basket so I had a place for my ketchup. :/ Hubbs food was about the same quality. He had bone-in wings and they were dry as well. Must have been lunch leftovers.  I'm just glad I spent a gift card and not my money on the meal!! Next time someone gives me a gift card there I plan to find one of the machines and trade it for cash!"}
{"text":"We visited this location after a tour of the NASCAR Hall of Fame on the Friday during winter storm Jonas and it was obvious that they had very few staff that showed up for work which was confirmed by our waitress. They did a fabulous job at compensating for lack of employees and were very pleasant and apologetic as well. I thought the food was fine but the fact that they really wanted to continue excellent service despite the challenge was what won me over. Good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"OMG, drove up to the 101 location today for my salt and vinegar fix, and it is just gone with a dumb sign saying it had to close immediately for \"business reasons\" and to try one of the other locations that are all like an hour away!!! I am devastated. If they don't open a new one around here soon, I am starting a petition!!!"}
{"text":"Worst BWW I've been to. Took my parents here while we were in the area running errands and it was awful. Three tables were sat after us and got their food first. Waitress told me they \"lost our order\" but then put it in and they were bringing it out soon. 1.5 hours for wings... no apology, no discount. Would not see myself ever going back"}
{"text":"Warm Springs & Durango location- 14 wings so dried out the only thing missing was the eyelets for laces, order of fried and 2 waters $22. Server was great!! management- if you forgot what the place was named for maybe consider a more appropriate name like \"Alzheimer's\". Also BWWs DOESN'T promote free range or non-antibiotic chickens- it's all about the money. Are there any better reasons to STAY AWAY?!"}
{"text":"Save your money!  Warm beer, and you can bet even money on receiving  the wrong order.  Bartender in constant state of distraction."}
{"text":"i wish i could give them 0 stars this place is horrible the service is so bad ! i asked for 10 lemon peper they only brought me 5 then i asked for ranch they never got it for me the waiter never asked if i wanted more water or another beer ! i only saw her once when she took my order and didnt even took the oder correct got everything wrong im never coming back to this place !"}
{"text":"Don't bother unless you enjoy watching waitresses wandering around chatting to each other and do anything but their actual job.  Is it  too much to ask for someone to come and take your order.  Oh and when the place is half empty that's right try sitting me next to a baby in a carseat who is practically on the table; yep that's what I want.  We stopped going there because the service was crappy but now they managed to take it to a whole new low."}
{"text":"I went to this location for lunch with my husband and 15 month old son. My son was extremely fussy waiting for food (which didn't take long to arrive) and even after we got the food. Our server encouraged me to go ahead and nurse him and got the check and to go boxes in case we needed to make a fast exit. Words can not describe how amazing this experience was.   The food was delicious and service was wonderful!  I've also ordered take out from this location several times and have always been satisfied."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING  on 1/3/16 ate the wings, got horrible food poisoning. I would not wish on my worst enemy.  I alerted Health Department. Called manager to file report. Didn't hear back from BWW corporate for 4 days. Run away as far and fast from this place as you can go! If you got food poisoning from here also please come forward!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of breading on the Buffalo Dry Rub. Tasted good, but needed more breading. I'm guessing they are made this way, where skin is deep fried with no breading."}
{"text":"Slow service, manager was nice. Half the waitresses did their job, the other half stood around and did nothing. Food was great."}
{"text":"I love their wings, and their bloody marys are pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Buffalo Wild Wings location in a very long time. Me and fiancé went during the day on a Sunday and there hardly anyone there. We sat the bar and the waiter was nice but she moved too slow. She was slow serving us, slow making our drinks, slow asking us for our order. Just overall Slow! We were the only people at the bar and we couldn't understand why she was serving us at a slow pace. Other than that the food was awesome as always."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic solid wings and a great selection of flavors. Ranging from mild honey BBQ to sweet with lingering heat mango habanero to the outrageously scorching blazing hot wings, this place has a flavor for everybody and their dog. Also, wings are 50 cents on Tuesdays which is a pretty awesome deal.  My go-to 3 wing flavors are Asian zing, Caribbean jerk, and mango habanero. All of them have a different kind of kick but it's all delicious. But if spicy isn't your thing, honey BBQ and parmesan garlic are other popular favorites.  This place also has a good variety of beer taps. From generic bud lights, light blue moons, and the bitter IPA's, they'll have something to complement your wings!  Good ambience. Often super crowded on a Tuesday night because of happy hour. But the trivia is fun and the walls are adorned with flatscreens on which to cheer for your favorite team if they're playing that night! Fantastic wings, good company, sports, good beer, all combine to create an experience that is greater than the sum of its parts. What's not to like?? =D"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings seems to have a monopoly on wings in the area, which is unfortunate.  The beer selection is decent, and the variety of wing sauces is adequate.  My issue with BWW is their execution.   The wings are small and tend to be oversauced.   I mean, if you have \"Wings\" in your name, then the wings you serve should be exceptional.  The service is so so.  For some reason they put huge gaming machines on every other booth to serve as an unnecessary distraction (unplugging them seems to fix that).   For what you get the food is overpriced, but like I said, they have a monopoly, so I'll probably continue to go back."}
{"text":"@BWWSteeleCreek I wish I had a way to give you less then one star, I ordered for a BOGO offer and your team messed up and asked us to come back and get the other order which we denied because we live good 11 miles from your store and i was not wanting to travel 11 miles one way to get food again. I received only half of my order because of which after reaching home I had to order some more food as the incomplete order we got was not enough. The person on phone told us come any day and get the order back. I called up today to get the order and the way manager talked was as if I am asking for a favor, i just told it was your fault and it was your teams commitment to give me the same order back, however insted of honoring the word given by the team he made me feel as if I am asking a favor for more food which I was not hence i told thanks to him and did not order anything.... is this what you call service that because of your fault your customer should bear the cost..... Worst experience.!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it here! I was excited when bw3 came to this area, because it was needed! Great environment and very neat! Food was amazing and hot! Loved our waitress, she was great! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I love this bdubs I go here all the time the service and the bartenders are always nice I can't complain not one bit."}
{"text":"I'll be honest and say I didn't expect much after reading reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised after my first visit. It was as dinner with several guests, but the server handled the orders and himself very well. I wish I had gotten his name. Very polite and the atmosphere was pretty cool, too. I did not go to the bar area, but will check that out the next time I'm there!"}
{"text":"I have gotten food poisoning DOS, TWO, DWA, TWEE, 2 times from this place!!! Both from pick up and the first time was 6 months ago!! I thought I was safe going back since it was half a year ago! Take my advice stay away."}
{"text":"So upset at this place. Asked about viewing the canelo fight and was told one thing and when I went there to check it out they were sold out. They don't have a clue on how to run a business."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday evening for a meeting with 6 other people. We were seated outside which was fine as it was a nice evening, however the hostess failed to mention there was a private party occupying the outdoor patio. We were seated, order drinks &, appetizers. Drinks came & we began our meeting. 1 hr later no appetizers & no waitress to even place our food order. We found manager and complained he said he'd send server right out. She never came 20 min later we found manager &, told him we were leaving to go to On Tap. He didn't even apologize. Just let us walk out.  We had a great meal at On Tap........we have monthly meetings in Medina sadly we will no longer be taking our business to BW3. The manager should have picked up servers slack & filled in for her if she couldn't keep up. What poor customer service"}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings was OK. There are better BWWs. When we walked in the hostest was preoccupied talking with other wait staff. She acted as if we were disturbing her. Our waitress was better. She was very nice. We were seated by the front. The hostest and other wait staff were very loud. All and all the wings were OK. I've had better. If it wasn't for our waitress I would have walked out."}
{"text":"We visited twice in a week, the first time was fight night so it was busy and loud. Overall it was positive, food was good, Mariah served us and did a great job. The only negative would be the front door hostess isn't the fastest at acknowledging you when you come in.  Second time was a Friday about 4 it wasn't to bust yet, but the food was good, Jess served us and did a great job as well, manager walking about asking of everything was good, which is always good. The only negative again is the front door greeting or hostess just isn't what it could be.   I would visit again."}
{"text":"The place was great. Lots of screens. Sports everywhere. Good wings. Blazing hot was too hot, couldn't finish. Nachos were great. Beer was amazing. Service was a bit slow. But it was a busy afternoon. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Seems like the service has been getting better as of recently. My boyfriend and I visited BWW last month and we were surprised at how much the service improved (although this is only based on our most recent visit). Our server was very attentive and didn't have to ask for refills of water. And even the manager was walking around and asking around to make sure the customers where happy with the service they were receiving."}
{"text":"I decided to give them a second chance, not because of the service but mainly the food. We arrived there was no wait however it did bother me that the to go cashiers couldn't even greet me. Like I understand they might not have to seat me, but all they had to say was, \"hello welcome to Bdubs, someone will be with you shortly.\" Whatever, we got seated eventually by a nice male host. He had mentioned that Drew would be our server, however a very nice server came. Well finally someone who knows about good customer service ! (( : Her name is Ashley. Totally hit my expectations. She didn't care that it was 2 young ladies and 2 teens. She still treated us equally like a regular customer. Which we are, but some servers have the misconception  that younger peeps are bad tippers. Not always the case. Anyways this time I came in a lot changed since my last visit. For the most part I saw every employee actually working for once. The floor was not dirty! I'm glad I gave them a second chance."}
{"text":"Horrible service, if you can call it that. I was seated in two minutes, before 6:45pm. At 6:55pm after trying to speak with a manager a server (not my server!) told my group they were so sorry and my server would be with us in a moment. At 7pm we left. I've been here when it was much busier (on football days/nights) and never had such lousy service - although it was my first time not sitting in the bar."}
{"text":"In comparisons to other B Dubs I've visited this one is better than most. I've never had a bad experience at this location. Service can be slow sometimes but the food is always hot and tasty. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER x2 experiences.  I'm sitting here now at 10:49 pm been waiting since 10 for my pick up that I called in at 945!!  This is ridiculous and when I finally received my food the order was wrong. There was a group of people that walked in and put in an order and got it within maybe 15 min and left. As to why I'm still sitting here I am wondering. On top of that they put me on hold 10 times with about 5-10 min hold intervals. This place has really bad customer service. The waitresses take forever and a minute. I have to admit the young lady at the cash out was very sweet didn't catch her name though. It is now 10:55 pm and I am now leaving. And not returning."}
{"text":"Came in for a pick up order and waited around for a while before someone came over. I thought they were going to help me but they didn't even acknowledge me and I had to stop and ask and they said someone will be coming. Granted it was pretty busy for a Thursday night, there were still three workers rolling silverware or more so they were just chatting it up and on their phone who didn't even look up to even ask me if I needed help. Didnt know I could get paid to just sit there and be on my phone.   When I finally got my order I didn't even get any napkins or utensils. I asked the girl who was rolling silverware if I could get some napkins from her stack and she gave me an annoyed look. Like excuse you, doesn't look like you were using those napkins anyways.   Gave it three stars because I have gone here for dine in and my servers have been nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I love coming to  Buffalo Wild Wings especially during lunch time. They have great lunch deals and I've been pretty happy with my food and service overall. One bad experience I had was at the Westgate one!"}
{"text":"Hands down the WORST service I've ever received. I recommend staying far away from this location. I spoke to the MANAGER who didn't tell me my total and hung up before I was done ordering my food over the phone. Then I waited 15 minutes there for my food after I called 25 minutes prior to my arrival when I was told it would be done in 15-20 minutes. Then I talked to a different manager about why I was upset in the restaurant and he also didn't care about anything I had to say so in turn I left with no food and very, very angry."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings, B-Dubs or BWW how ever you say it all means the same!    Buffalo Wild Wings always delivers!  The food is always pretty consistent and the service most of the time is pretty good.  This time though I have to send a shout out our server Christina.  We have had her several times.  She remembers us even though we don't come in that often.  She is so cute with a great personality.  She always offers suggestions and displays an over and beyond attitude no matter how busy she is.  She even got the BF hooked on the LA Water.  *its one of the bartender's specialties not on the menu.  Be sure to order one. Its tasty and leaves ya loopy. LOL  We ordered the pretzels with the spicy honey mustard and queso.  The queso is not that great but I do love the mustard.  The pretzels are soft on the inside...always delicious.  BF ordered the traditional wings (6 mild sauce and 6 with desert heat rub).  The desert heat rub is really good.  We have actually bought the rub for grillin at home.  Its a little on the spicy side so I wouldn't suggest it for the fragile peeps.  I ordered the naked tenders (naked tenders are grilled white meat strips and not fried) tossed in the desert heat and they were good as always.  I ordered with Caribbean Jerk on the side with Fat Free Ranch.  The Jerk sauce is pretty spicy but it is by far my fave!  We also ordered the wedges to share.  Those are yummy dipped in any kind of sauce.  Lagundo brought our food out.  Lagundo, Gondo, G or God's Gift to B-Dubs is how he introduced himself when we asked his name. LOL  Each time this guy has come to our table he is one of the most pleasant, smily, kind hearted young people I have ever come across.  I was astonished to find out he was only 17.  I had to mention to him how pleasant we thought he was each time we go there and that we thought he really has a special quality in customer service. This guy really has a presence about him.  What a great quality to have at such a young age.  I hope his manager notices what a benefit he is and could be!   What can I say? We are total suckers for excellent service and in this city and this day in age it comes few and far between unfortunately.  So shout outs to SUPERB CUSTOMER SERVICE is necessary to Yelp I believe  Christina and Lagundo will be the deciding factor on our quick return back for sure....and the food a quick second factor or course."}
{"text":"We met up with some friends here on a Saturday night.  The place was pretty busy being there were baseball games and the UFC going on.  We were seated towards the back right next to all the kids games.  For some reason parents think its okay to let their kids hang around them even if they aren't really playing them.  Quite rude I must say.  However, that is besides the point.  Brian was our server.  The place was busy but he was all over making sure we were well taken care of.  I love that.  All the food was good from what I saw that everyone ordered.  However the \"rub\" on whoever ordered it was not obvious to taste.  One person had the vinagar salt on their chicken-you couldnt taste it at all, and another had the desert heat and same outcome.  I did have the desert heat on my naked tenders and it was perfect so I must have gotten the right \"rub-chef\". LOL  Other than that...everything ordered minus the \"rub\" issues was great.  On the way out the manager greeted us to make sure all was good and we gave our kudos to Brian the waiter!  I hope that got back to him.  Love great customer service!"}
{"text":"Long story short, I arrived one hour early for a get-together to set up for party of 16. After one hour of waiting, no table was given to us with lack of communication to us. We did not know that the table was already set up, and we did not know of any \"rules\" they had about 30 minute wait time and having half the party in order to be seated and all other things they mentioned AFTER all of the party was present. Even the manager seemed careless.  I understand it's near the Strip so it's more crowded than other locations. It's still not okay to act on your own without informing the customers of your decisions."}
{"text":"Typical place for us to ride our motorcycles too. Always can find parking and a seat inside. Usually we go during the day and the service is always very attentive and quick. Great wings and quick menu options. Good prices on beers. Every time we are in here the manager always makes his rounds to make sure we, and other guests around us, are enjoying everything. It makes you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"9 wings instead of 10? Really? Are they that desperate to turn a profit? Wish i could upload pictures of my anorexic wings.I would be embarrassed to serve these to my friends at home let a lone a business. Can they play the music any louder? I guess talking to your friends isn't allowed and I could hardly hear the waiter. I had $45 in gift cards and when i walked out I gave them away guy living on the street. I don't have a use for them anymore. Do yourself a favor and head across the parking lot to Canes!"}
{"text":"I've came here too many times to count,but as always I leave satisfied. The service is decent when ultra busy but understandable and the food always gives ya a kick with new surprises of flavor. My personal favorite!!! Getting a 8 piece boneless (don't judge me lol) mango habanero with cheese wedges and an ice cold Stella Artois served in its proper chalice glass. The flavor that explode when biting into the wings are sweet yet real spicy,sometimes too spicey too bare but that's what the brew is for haha!! But place is great for sports watching and chilling with friends as well."}
{"text":"Service is great. The food is good, but usually on the cold side. It seems like every time I go my food is cold. But I keep going back so I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"Food was excellent today however service was not.  It's disappointing that great customer service is something of the past. After waiting more than 10 minutes for a server we finally ordered food and drinks. The food was great however you would have thought I was ripping the place off when I asked for a third cup of ranch. (15 wings)   It took me asking for a manager for them to waive the $.60. My wife and I have been coming here since they opened weekly and have never had that experience.   The Assistant GM they sent to the table after I asked to speak with a manager was not friendly and only restated some policy I have never heard of and never has been enforced before.   There are too many places to choose from in Surprise than to put up with straight out poor customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped  in after the pirates game and it wasn't to crowded and had a great atmosphere. Our group of 11 was seated immediately and we were provided with  quick drink service.  One of the ordered appetizers never came out once we had ordered though. The wait time on the food was the major problem.  60 plus minutes  for food is tough to handle when the tables around you come  in later order wings and get them fairly quickly (15 to 20 min). Food was good but the wait was brutal.  I'll return again because  the atmosphere  and food quality  but if waits like this continue to happen I will look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre, some times I'm asked for a drink before ten minutes I'm being seated. Otherwise the food is mostly good, the wings are pretty awesome as the standard for BWW is in most states. I get the buffalo mac n cheese with Honey BBQ and it is GREAT. My 3 star rating is only due to the lazy service."}
{"text":"Our drinks were empty the majority of the time - through the four quarter Cavs game the waitress came by our table about three times until we asked for the check. The wings are ok, about what you'd expect from a place like this.   However, the worst thing about this place is that they were playing Fox News on a good quarter of the TVs up until 8:30 pm. If I'm eating dinner and catching up with friends. I don't want to be surrounded by tvs showing bombed out cars, the aftermath of disasters, and social strife. No matter what your politics this makes for a very unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"I'm getting played. I went there tonight (3/21/16) and my order included french fries. I made another order not too long after, ordering another french fries the same size, both of them to-go. When I got home, I opened them both and one had WAY less than the other. I honestly could have counted them. I love BWW but this specific one needs to pay more attention to their serving sizes, because I'm sure careless mistakes like this happen more than often."}
{"text":"Huge spot! We had a great waitress! Very friendly! Plenty of big screen tvs! Played trivia games and live poker electronically on the screens against other customers. It was extremely fun and highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you are looking for mediocre food and an average dining experience this place is for you.  Lots of TVs, I have to be honest this is why we went.  Had the buffalo chicken salad which was decent.  Burger was dry and rather bland, but is was $6 burger Monday so it was only $6.  Fries are average.  Wings were a little light on the sauce, .70 if you ask for extra sauce.  The service was irritating. They made it difficult to use the yelp discount.  So pluses for the salad and TVs. Negatives on everything else.  Much better sports bars in the local area that will get my business in the future instead."}
{"text":"Walked into Buffalo wild wings one night on the graveyard shift and there was a Caucasian baldheaded full sleeved tattooed bartender there who had the worst attitude on the planet. This guy thought he was the king sh*t of all bartenders. Needless to say, half way during my service with this moron I walked out. I will never go to this Buffalo wild wing ever again. This is not the first and last time I've had bad experiences with the bartenders at this particular restaurant/bar. Whoever does the hiring there has no clue how to run a business."}
{"text":"Food is good but let me tell you the tables arrangement suck. It looks like a speed date set up. I can hear everything my neighbor is saying and not because they are speaking loud because the tables are 5 inches apart. I feel bad for the waiters struggling to carry the drink and stuff without knocking over someone's drink."}
{"text":"Each time I go to BWW which is once a year I am reminded why I dislike it so much. The food is not appealing nor eatable. The atmosphere seems dirty even for a sports bar. During my last visit flies were flying around and trash remained on the floor even after the tables were \"bussed\" by the workers."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and while it's not the worst BWW I've been too is by far not the best.  The good: lots of TV's and miss of drinks specials.  The bad: I had my post screwed up twice in one visit and hardly an apology to go with it.  The place is kinda cramped compared to a lot of the other BWW's I've been to. The angling is weird and even though there's a lot of TV's not all of them address very easy to see because it's just not very open.  The staff is nice but again they have messed up my order more than any other BWW so that leaves an impression."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst service and food I've ever had in my entire life. I knew it was going to be a nightmare as soon as we walked into the place if we wouldn't have had a gift card we would've turned around and left. As soon as we stepped in the door it smelled terrible like the carpets haven't been cleaned since the place opened. I asked if a booth was available and the two ditzy hostesses looked at eachother and barely shook their heads no towards one another. They then said we could sit on the patio but I didn't feel like doing that because it was about 45-50 degrees. They said we could sit at a high table but didn't walk us to the table. After finally finding a place to sit we waited for a good 10-15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our presence, when our waitress (Anna) finally came over to us she said \"someone has waited on you right!?\" Once our food came to the table 20 minutes later my fries were ice cold and we had no silverware. My wife didn't get one refill on her drink I only got one and I got it when my first drink was still completely full. Our bill came to $25.85 which was good because my gift card was $25.00 when I handed he card over she says we couldn't give the debit card to cover the remaining .85, seems stupid to me, I'm pretty sure any other place in America would do it that way. But whatever, I gave her the card and she says \"oh I messed up because I was going so fast I rang up the full $25.00 so you still owe .85 if you have a dollar I will take it.\" I give her a buck and never got the change, needless to say she got a $1.00 and that was too much. I won't be going back to any BWW this one and the service ruined it for me for life! This hell hole doesn't even deserve 1 star. When we left the restaurant I was scanning for a manager and naturally I didn't see one anywhere. The only good thing about this evening was having a gift card so I didn't have to use my money."}
{"text":"BW3 (as it used to be called) is a solid sports bar that I try to frequent maybe once a month or so.  It doesn't get five stars due to the fact that sometimes the bathrooms are a bit dirty and the prices are only average, not really a steal.  One thing that I don't see mentioned in these reviews is their stance on smoking.  I only go to this one location but I hope ALL BW3 locations in the Vegas area are like this one on Eastern.  There is NO SMOKING!!!  Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't an indoor non-smoking ordinance pass for Clark County??  Why then do I have to breath in dirty smoker's 2nd-hand smoke when visiting some of BW3's competitors......most notably PT's!?!?  Kudos to Buffalo Wild Wings for enforcing the non-smoking rules, unlike those spineless idiot managers at PT's!!!  I'm slowly turning my friend's toward Buffalo Wild Wings even though they've been fans of PT's for years.  The bottom line is that as long BW3's does the right thing and keeps the place completely non-smoking, they have a customer in me!  Also, I think for the summer, they have an all-you-can-eat lunch wing special that I would recommend trying out.  My friend and I did the boneless unlimited special last week and I was able to eat 24 boneless wings for what essentially was the price of approximately 14!!  After your initial order of 12, they bring them out 6 at a time so you can get everything fresh, try multiple flavors and don't accidentally over-order!  It worked out awesome and my drink was never empty either.  The very first BW3 location was across the street from the Ohio State University, which was a favorite college hang-out for me.  Now that I've moved to Nevada, its nice to be able to keep going back to this place and, once again, enjoy good food in a 100% smoke-free environment!"}
{"text":"Great servers yet the kitchen and managers are awful! Food takes entirely too long and it's overpriced. Too many great Scottsdale restaurants to frequent to waste your time on this place. Avoid! Check out the other places around here"}
{"text":"Finally got the family together for dinner.  The host greeted us promptly, told us about 10 minutes, no problem.  20 minutes later and 6 empty tables they finally decided to seat the 4 of us.  If you are the kind of person that likes a drink with your meal, my suggestion, get it yourself from the bar.  Thats what my husband ended up doing.  I asked the waitress for some mayo for my burger...she brought it to me about 10 minutes later...after she cleaned the table next to us.  The service is usually so-so but last night was horrible.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the food is decent and we can play buzztime."}
{"text":"It's 3am and I can't sleep so I decided to write a review lol. Me and my significant other ate here tn and we had a good experience. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is , we were standing in the seating area for a while before asking why we were there. Not sure why it takes 2 ppl to take care of a take out order , but it did. And when we were finally seated it took another 15 minutes before anyone came to our table and took our drink order. But after that it was smooth sailing. Our server was very nice and helpful. She made sure we were doing ok quite often. Our food came out pretty quick and it was very delish. It's very clean , inviting and the temperature was also very comfortable. Our bill was reasonable for the amount of food and drinks we ordered , we both left satisfied. Overall it was a good experience. Thank you for reading. :)"}
{"text":"I love chicken wings but the wings they use here are a bit too small. The boneless chicken wings is the best way to go even though it looks like chicken nuggets. The variety of sauces are pretty good. This may be the only thing that redeems this place. Everything is ala carte which means expensive for bar food. For the price...not worth it for me . Just buy your favorite  sauces and cook your own wings at home."}
{"text":"Bad service. Screwed up multiple times. No napkins. No silverware. Forgot to take one persons order. Wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"The wings here are decent, but not great by any means.  If you're there to drink they make a strong drink called the Buffalo Zoo.  The drink is essentially their version of the Long Island Iced Tea.  The real reason I even feel like writing this review is to tip anyone reading this off to a better place for wings.  The Orpheum up the street has a happy hour that includes free chicken wings if you're drinking.  The wings at the Orpheum are so much better than the wings BW3 makes.  The Orpheum has it's happy hour 4-7 Tuesday through either Thursday or Friday, not sure which."}
{"text":"My wife called for a carry-out, ordered traditional wings and salad for carry-out, and then she specifically mentioned, not to forget the celery sticks and carrots and especially the ranch dressing.  I went and picked it up, received the order and went home.  Got home, and guess what's missing?? the celery sticks, carrots and ranch dressing.  I mean c'mon, those items should be automatic for carry out.  And this is the 2nd time that happened to us, this servers on the carry out section needs to be trained.  It gets irritating when you get home, and you don't have everything that you ordered, especially the items that should be standard for pickup and what mentioned in the first place to not forget.  If a manager on this establishment is reading this, could you please address this issue and train your staff?  Thank you."}
{"text":"Worst buffalo buffalo wild wings location ! Arived with a party of 16 and was asked to build our own section. When sat the server threw the menu on the table! If you are planing to come here I suggest you go to another location."}
{"text":"Terrible service,  messed up multiple orders and wasn't able to get a complete refund for godawful experience.  Will not recommend to my greatest enemy."}
{"text":"Came here a second time and the service was much better. There were two servers that attended to us and were constantly asking if we needed anything else like drink refills or food. It wasn't too busy on a Sunday afternoon, but that was likely because the Bears game wasn't on at the time."}
{"text":"Place is nice. Music may be a tad too loud. But the wings taste great and the size is good. To expect giant chicken wings is just asking to be fed steroid meat. Lol. The staff are young kids, so they horse around sometimes in front of customers but thats all coachable. Ive been there twice and have yet to be disappointed with the food. Dessert is fantastic too"}
{"text":"Worst B Dub's ever........  So it began when the guy at the host counter sat us all the way in the back of the restaraunt.  Not a big deal usually, but this trip to B dub was to get my buddy out of the house.  He had a broken pelvis and could barely walk.  He had to hobble past several empty tables while he was put on display for all of the partons and staff to see.  There was an empty table right next to the door.  Why couldn't we be seated there.  Piss poor customer service.  It gets worse.  After what seemed to be an eternity. our order showed up.  No plates, utencils, just a bowl full of wings.  When we asked for plates and utincels, the waitress scouled and shook her head in discust.  Wow, excellent example of how to treat your guests.  By this time, we had enough.  We asked to see the manager, who came over and blew off the fact they made a crippled man walk across the restaraunt (took 5 minutes) to be seated, and then he made excuses as to why his staff was angry.  Then he offered to reduce the bill, but when the bill came we were charged full price.    As we left, none of the staff offered to help my buddy with the door.  As I pulled the car up for him, I noticed him fighting with the door and his walker, while the staff stood at the host desk and watched.  What a bunch of d-bags.  I called in to the restaraunt after we left and asked to speak to the general manager.  He was out, but was assured he would return the call.  7 days later still no word.  Dear Mr. GM, here's your Yelp review.  Choke on it.  Not that you give a turkey anyway.  I'd rather lick the floor of a KFC than visit this B Dub ever again."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a zero to this damn place only because of the bullshit customer service. I had to ask several times for the drink I already paid for. Isn't this weird? She handed me the drink without a lid on it and with no straw. I had to refill the drink by myself, find a straw by myself, and even clean the table by myself!!! Me and my friend received no service from the beginning we sat down to the end we left except a nice cleaning guy asked us if we need a water... No more .... I will definitely not go this place! How could this kind of rude person be ever employed to work in a restaurant??!"}
{"text":"The food was good but I asked for 3 blue cheese and only got 1 and 2 ranch which I can't stand ranch  I ordered fries and then they come out with lemon pepper fries like uh NO thank you. They gave my only carrots no celery. I know for sure I am going to another BWW even if I have to drive out further."}
{"text":"If you wanna wait 15min while the young teens are in the back fuckin around before they bring u your fresh order which will be cold when u get it! then come here & wait if u have nothin else better to do with your precious time u can not get back!"}
{"text":"On Sunday July 10, my family and friends were so excited to see the euro cup so we decided to go to buffalo wings  restaurant and watch the game. Once we got there,the waitress came up to us to ask what we would like to drink half an hour after we sat.  We finally started to order the food the waitress took almost forever to take.  We finally got the food almost an hour after we placed the order and some got their food while others didn't and we had to ask so many times for the rest of the order. The waitress still didn't get the order right and we had to wait for another half an hour for her to get the right order. Finally our wings came but they were cold,we told the waitress that the wings are cold and we were missing a basket of fries all she did is say sorry and walked away.  We waited for so long and we just ate the cold food,there were 14 people on our table and we all finished the wings and food but the fries still didn't   It's the worst experience I have ever had in any restaurant . I will never come back..."}
{"text":"Disgusting food/Family Sick - Absolutely disgusting food that made my wife and two little girls sick. BWW used to be a good place to go but they have gone downhill fast. I called to tell the manager that next day that the food was bad and it made my family sick. The manager refused to help with the situation and was promptly forwarded to the Risk Management bureaucracy. I was told I should get a call in 2 days to deal with the situation. Nothing... Two weeks later I called the corporate office on my own and was basically told that my family's' illness was not due to their food and none of their concern. Thank God my wife and kids are better now but I would not suggest going to this restaurant unless you wan to get sick. Stay Away!"}
{"text":"Two stars for the beers. Prosperity on tap which was awesome. Unfortunately that was the only good thing here. To get a table took 10 minutes before anyone said hello. Server was pleasant. Food was not fresh. Water was questionable."}
{"text":"Was craving wings and needed a kid-friendly, low key environment. Being that it was a Friday at 6 PM, we figured it would be crowded but were surprised to see only a few tables with people at them. In hindsight, we should have taken the clue and walked out.   We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer and a variety of wings. The dip came out in a CARDBOARD bowl and the chips were stale. The was a brown crust along the top of the dip as if it had been sitting awhile after coming out of the microwave (probably!). No surprise, it was not good. Definitely not fresh!  As for the wings, they were edible. Decent I guess. The sauce was weird, questionable on freshness.   Bottom line, there's really no enduring qualities to this place and I would skip it. We definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"I want to like this place so bad. I've been a fan of Bdubs all over the place for years and so excited we finally have one downtown. But my first two times were terrible service at the bar because the same woman was just plain lost. Now I order a cocktail and they served it in basically a shot glass, and it was weak! I hate to see a place downtown fail, especially because I live here. Unless they step it up it's time to go."}
{"text":"Went in to try this place 35 minutes before close on a Thursday night. and bartender screams I am getting ready to call last call.  She hadn't. Then said I can serve you but it will only be a short. Drank my beer and then same bartender asks if I want anything to eat. Hmmmmmm without a drink and feeling like she cared more about getting out on time than she did the customers paying her wages. I opted not to order and will spend my dollars on someplace that values customers. Save your time and go to  friendlier place to eat and drink."}
{"text":"I want to echo what Rob L. said about this place ... I usually LOVE BWW, but this last time was horrible! From the moment we walked in we sensed something was off. There was nobody there to seat us, which is no big deal, but the place was pretty slow and we waited about 5 min before anyone even acknowledged we were there. Once the girl finally came by, she was clueless and said somebody will be with us ... 10 min later someone finally sat us.  The server was probably the worst server I have ever had! disinterested and seemed like he'd rather be flirting with the other female servers or horsing around with him friends than paying attention to his tables. I had to have him flagged down by other servers a couple times and then finally talked to the manger. Bad experience all around and it saddens me because as i said I like this place and usually have a ood time, but the BWW on Mcdowell in Goodyear is going downhill real fast if they let servers like Sean continue to work there."}
{"text":"Ive been here for multiple occasions and usually always have a good experience. It is loud and the food is good. I do like how they separate my wing order so the flavors do not mix.   The atmosphere is casual and it can get busy if a sporting event is going on. There is also a bar. The great thing about this place is that it is open late. I used to order in all the time when i would get off of work super late and not want to go through a drive through. You pick it up at the bar but you do have to be 21 to do so after eleven oclock i believe."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. My brother and I went for a after work dinner with a bunch of coworkers, and ended up not eating at all. The waitress was very unprofessional. Everyone else has received their food yet my brother and I didn't. We orders a plain burger with fries, that's it. She claimed she put it in but the order fell through with the kitchen, (this was now over an hour after we ordered) she offered to get us our food and box it up for us to go with an attitude like it was our fault.. No discounts or anything. We then asked for a manager, she came back and said if we wanted to talk to a manager we would have to find one ourselves because the manager refused to come outside (were we were seated). That was not true because we went to find another waiter who indeed brought us the manager who then confirmed she was never aware of our situation. Don't go here. Ever."}
{"text":"The food came really late and when it finally arrived it was cold. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Jimmie is the best grave bartender in the southwest las Vegas.place is awesome on graveyard, best bar to hang out at luv this place"}
{"text":"The food takes forever to be served. The sauces on the side never come and most of the time you need to ask for them again. The staff is rude, especially at the bar. Went there a couple of times cuz its really close to home. Never went home satisfied."}
{"text":"I typically find BW3s tolerable.  Not my favorite place, but OK for a quick beer.  The Avon Lake location is just completely unacceptable, however.  I ordered one of the  flatbreads with chicken.  I started to eat the flatbread and I thought the meat had an odd texture, so I started picking through the cheese to get to the chicken underneath.  Once I did this, I found that the chicken was almost completely raw.  It's not like this was a fried chicken finger where the inside was not visible to a cook (an honest mistake).  The cook in the kitchen cut this meat and placed it on the flatbread.  Ummm...you don't notice it was bright pink?  It could not have been on the grill more than 1-2 minutes.  I worked in restuarants for many years, so I know what happens (usually) when someone gets raw chicken.  The entire check is usually comped and you get a gift certificate for a future visit along with profuse, sincere apologies.  Here...management was oblivious.  This guy should have retired years ago...he clearly has no interest in working or providing good customer service.  Moving around the restaurant seemed like a chore to him.  He acted like it was no big deal and took the flatbread off of my bill.  Oh geez, thanks!  That really makes up for getting sick the next morning.  I sent two \"emails\" to corporate and it's been well over a month.  No one has responded to me.  If that's how this company handles an issue as serious as this, well...I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here a few nights ago with my 10 month old and my husband. Service was great. Our server was Jake and we were so pleased. He was always checking in. He had our sons food out almost immediately, and was extremely kind. Food was great as always"}
{"text":"My family and I went there tonight for dinner. My daughter requested it for her 7th birthday dinner because she knows they give out crowns for kids birthdays! We chose to eat in the bar area. At the first table we chose (the only open one) we waited for someone to come clean it. After 5-7min of waiting we moved to another table that had opened up and had been cleaned. Now it took our waitress 10 min to come over and introduce herself. We ended up placing our drink, appetizer and meal order all at once. When the food did come out, it came out all at once instead of appetizers and then our meal. I ordered the chicken chop salad. It came to me with no dressing. Our waitress didn't come ask us how everything was for at least 7-10 min. It was at this time I was able to tell her about my salad dressing missing, but everyone else in my party was done eating, so I just asked for everything to go.  My husband had ordered a beer. His cup sat empty for about 15 min. No one ever asked if he wanted another or even showed up at the table so he could at least get a water. Because of this, he was unable to finish his food because of the spice associated with eating.  My daughter never did get her crown...it was a disappointing evening. This review is coming from someone who used to eat there almost weekly during football season..."}
{"text":"Went to BWW last night and can't imagine returning any time soon.  The food is what it always is, which is very good, but the service was beyond slow and the atmosphere horrible.  TV's were crazy loud, prohibiting any kind of conversation.  Had to scream our order to our server.  It was freezing too.  We were shivering while eating our food.  When I complained to our server about it, I was told that the thermostat was controlled someplace else and there was nothing they could do about it.  Lastly, in the middle of our meal we were solicited to make a donation to some charity.  The cause may be a good one, and I'm not opposed to the solicitation, but the timing of it was awful.  I'm not going to stop eating, clean my hands and get into my purse.  Ask when I'm seated or ask when I'm paying (the better option) but not in the middle of my meal. The one star was for the meal.  I do like the wings and the spicy garlic sauce.  Everything else was a major fail last night."}
{"text":"Buzztime champ of the night, well only one round out of three. Some guy killed me the other rounds. If you do not know what that is, it is the trivia game you can play while you eat and I do it every time. At least at this BWW's they gave me a device that works! Yay!   Also the food is usually good, however I had tried their grilled chicken sandwich and did not really care for that. Fries are always good though. We did go on wing Thursday so my friends got 3 orders of 5 different flavored wings. Got to love that. I still have not found a sauce to my liking, but I will try again soon maybe.   The waitress was really nice at this one. She really got involved with us in a conversation about random things and it was pretty cool. She remembered the RANCH! Yes!   Also my Peach Tea (alcoholic) was amazing. I shall be back to this one in the future only because its the closet one. I mean usually all BWW's are the same, but this was my first trip to one in Vegas and it was really the same as always. They have good drinks, wings, and fries, everything else not so great."}
{"text":"I went on a Monday night. It wasn't very busy. Our waitress was great however the food was not. I got boneless wings and those were hard. A friend of mine ordered the chicken/bacon sandwich and her burger came cold and they served our entire table cold French fries. I'd rather go to All Stars on Rutherford."}
{"text":"Wings. Tasty wings. It's in the name, and it's what BDubs is all about. As someone who doesn't give a crap about sports, it's still a great place to go, and mainly for the wings.  Since May I think I've been to this location 5 times, and have had some minimal ups and downs.  Getting seated and situated is never problem, and neither is ordering, but once you get your food (which  takes longer then it should), it seems as though the waiter/tress just forgets about you and never stops by (and this as happened on a couple occasions).  As for the food - the wings are where it's at. They're delicious, and the sauces make them reach a level no other wing has reached. 14 delicious sauces, and they can also be used with chicken tenders, sandwiches and so on.  So besides wings (and chicken tenders), I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which I was really excited about, as I love pulled pork, and it came with the hot bbq sauce as well. But when I got it, it was a disappointment. The bread seemed dry, the sauce wasn't up to par, and even the pulled pork seemed dry! I learned my lesson, stick with wings!  And for those planning on doing the Blazin Challenge, if you pass, you still have to pay $5 for the shirt, it's no longer free."}
{"text":"Boneless wings are the deal on Thursday. Travis struggled a bit but the TV kept us entertained.  The mac and cheese really was cheap and good."}
{"text":"Everytime I go watch a game at this place I have a poor experience.  The service is a lil overkill.  If your a sports fan, this is not the place to watch a game.  The service staff has no clue that your zoned in and wanna be left alone after ordering.  They keep nagging asking u if everything's OK.  They also lack in courtesy by constantly breaking the plane in front of your screen and interrupting your view.  In addition the food is not that good either; the wings are too fatty and undercooked.  I don't recommend watching a sporting event there ever!!  I will never go back..."}
{"text":"Wing Tuesdays are the way to go! They have a promotion on Tuesdays where you can get traditional wings at a discount. The wings here blow everyone else out of the water. They have a variety of flavors that cater to everyone! I really like how they have their flavors on a spicy meter so you know what level of spice you're getting yourself into.  My favs: -Salt and Vinegar (dry rub that has a punch of flavor) -Mango Habanero (a must try if you like spicy) -Asian Zing (mildly spicy, but full of flavor) -Parmesan Garlic -Spicy Garlic  I've had a few others that were good, but these are the ones that have stood out to me."}
{"text":"Decided to watch the games here on Sunday, asked for a snack sized wings they gave me a small no biggie didn't complain and just paid for it. Went to the bathroom they poured out my 1/4 of beer with the napkin/coaster on the top of it the first bar tender apologized and poured me a half to make up for it. After the first games were done went out to smoke and my seat was taken and my nearly full was beer gone, I cleared the tab for the first bar tender cause she was going off shift and was about to start a new one."}
{"text":"I love coming to Buffalo Wild Wings! I have never had a problem with my food, great taste, and a good spot to hangout with friends. The servers have always been very kind towards me! :)"}
{"text":"Bww is right by our house. Stopped in for wings and beer. We had the wing combo. Half boneless half traditional comes with fries. Perfect for sharing. We always like sitting at the bar. They have gaming if your into that. There's two bartenders we like helping us. Last night we had Shane. He's always super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"My wife and I met there for lunch. We started with an order of fried pickles which were horrible. The batter was grainy like it consisted only of cornmeal. We each ordered fish tacos which arrived luke warm. Our waiter was running all over the place and seemed really behind...this would explain why our food arrived late. The fish was heavily battered and heavily deep fried.....like a big, greasy sponge. I know some of you are thinking \"why did this guy go to a wings place and get fish tacos\". Well folks, once I got a look at their wings I decided the fish tacos were probably a safer bet. I make delicious fish tacos at home and figured they couldn't screw them up. I thought wrong.  So $30 and a gut-ache later I find myself wondering why I thought this place would be any good at all. Do yourself a favor and avoid BWW at all costs. Where did I put that Maalox again?"}
{"text":"The last time my husband and I went to this location our service was horrible. We sat in the bar section and the waiter we had was not attentive at all. Than we sat there waiting to give our order and we had to go to the bar to ask for our waiter to come back. He was more interested in the bigger groups in the area than us and the other smaller tables.   We are also very unhappy with the fact that the sizes for the wings have changed but the prices have not. So now you get five wings for the price you would have gotten six. Very unhappy with that. We love Buffalo Wild Wings but don't like the changes that have been made!"}
{"text":"I ordered online and the female who answered the phone was not helpful at all. My mozzarella sticks were not cooked all the way and my wings were basically just breaded fat with way too much sauce. Definitely will not be going back to this particular Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"This location is just horrid. My husband and I love bww but we will be taking our business to one of their other locations because after giving this one multiple attempts, they have failed us each and every time. Every time that we Have been here they have only had a few tables worth of people, and yet the service has been ridiculously slow. Our food has come out still partially frozen and we have received the wrong meals several times. If you want your check, you should just ask for it as soon as you order because they typically take 20-30 minutes to bring you your tab once you've asked for it. Last time we were there, we overheard a very rude child hating waitress complaining  to a fellow waitress about our son (who is 1 and was just making happy noises) being too loud, even though the noise level in the entire building was loud. Management is very sweet and does try to correct the situation every time, but the situations shouldn't arise repeatedly in the first place. So many things go wrong every time that it just destroys the dining experience. I recommend driving the extra distance to go to a different location."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. The restaurant wasn't crowded and it took FOREVER to get our food. The parm garlic wings were not good. The burger and wings the others in my group had weren't good either. I was so disappointed and will never ever go back.  Oh and there was a glob of goo on the entry floor and it was still there when we left. Tons of people working, and no one cleaned it up."}
{"text":"Could maybe be the worst service I've ever had at any place.   Ignored by everyone here.   Good food however.   5stars for food 1 star for service.  So B dubs gets a 3.  However if you want great service just prefer it togo and get beers from your Fridge. Cause this chick bartender won't get you a drink EVER!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to at least 20 different locations across a few states and this one was my favorite of them all. Our waitress was wonderful, as was our overall experience. She was my super friendly and efficient, my appetizer and wings came out really hot and really fast, love it. I asked the waitress to put on the Rockets game for me and within a  few seconds, it was playing on three or four Tv's surrounding us. Dark haired waitress  (whose name I can't remember) great job, great service."}
{"text":"They should have stayed closed. Food was not very good, portion sizes were very small and it was overpriced. Plus, our waiter stunk. Literally, the man needed a shower so badly, I held my breath whenever he came to the table. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Five stars for one outstanding service, Kailee was an awesome server. She was a delight! I can't really stand BWW's food, but her service made the entire experience. If the managers are reading this they need to reward her!"}
{"text":"Just like all over Buffalo wild wings are pretty consistent. This bww had the cheesesteak sandwich the eluded me in NYC. They had my beer type, cider on tap."}
{"text":"I really liked their boneless wings especially with Mango habanero sauce.place is pretty good to hangout at a decent price."}
{"text":"I am there every Monday for MNF and Stephanie is always our waitress. She totally takes care of us like we're kings! I would give it more stars, but it's just a BWW...."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner a little later in the evening and were seated in the dining area and then waited, and watched other tables seated after us get service, and waited...  Just about the time we were about to go to the host stand and let them know we hadn't gotten any service, we noticed one of the servers who clearly wasn't even on the clock anymore go nudge another server and point to our table.  The one that wasn't working walked past our table and told us our server would be right with us before continuing on with whatever sidework she was doing.  We then watched our server finish bussing a dirty table, and then go to the bar to get drinks for another table, before finally coming over to take our drink order.  She never apologized for the wait, just took our order and walked away.  The food also was not very good.  I got a buffalo chicken wrap which was pretty bland.  That kind of surprised me for a restaurant with \"Buffalo\" in the name.  My girlfriend got one of their burgers that was on special.  It was slathered in beer cheese which had soaked through one of the buns.  She ended up just discarding that bun and eating the burger and other bun with a fork and knife.  I can't see us going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This location is by far Top 3 in Las Vegas! It is always fully staffed and I'm greeted by the friendliest servers, like Vicky. The only complaint I have is the lighting. It is VERY dark in there but still gets 5 stars from me. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Bartender was very rude, management came out very unprofessional when I asked to speak to him. I spend at least $200.00 every week at this BWW. Workers know my family and I by name from how often we go there. My first bar experience at BWW  bar was a horrific experience and I will NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!   That Being Said You Lost A Regular Customer"}
{"text":"Thank you corporate for resolving the issues with the happy hour segregation, we enjoyed ourselves and the food was excellent, our server bailey was very helpful, polite, and professional and kept a smile on our faces the whole time incredible service she's a true asset to the company. We Shall return."}
{"text":"we have been going here for over 3 yrs for football sunday!!! now due to a few, my group has been told that the regular rules of first come first option for sound and tv are now being changed to some kins of ticket game, we are no longer going there. they have pushed us out and lost a $500 a week check. plus!!! last time a friend of ours was in they didnt even get a ticket for the drawing at all!!!!   i really believe that shawna the manager is behind this and she really needs a better customer service persona.  good bye bww's"}
{"text":"Last weekend I placed my order online. If I didn't have a gift card I'm not sure I would ever go there. The service pretty much is all the reason not to go back. I was having friends over for the football game and figured ordering at 11:30 would have me back In time. Order was said to be ready at 12:20. I got there, order wasn't ready after 40 minutes they handed me some random bag, I got to my car to check and sure enough wrong order. I went back inside and waited another 20 minutes, order was there the entire time in their \"heater\". No apologies, nothing. Somethings are beyond people's control sometimes, but this time it was clear employee just didn't care. It was consistent, I tweeted them because many times when customers who have bad service and they bring it to the attention of the corporation you're at least issued an apology. Not this time. If you're really hard up for Wings, be my guest. The service will be bad, and they won't care, you can't say you weren't warned. If you get bad service you were kind of asking for it. It's much like dicks last resort except when you go to dicks at least the rude behavior is funny."}
{"text":"There are many other restaurants around Chandler Mall, avoid this one. We had the Sampler platter and an entree, one beer and water, over $27 with tax. It wasn't busy for obvious reasons. Wings were rubbery, service was slow. I should have yelped before I chose."}
{"text":"We love this bww on Indian Bend. The staff is super awesome. We have kids and they get treated like royalty here which always makes a parent feel good. Everytime we come everyone is so nice and you get that personal touch feeling. The service is more than you could ask for. Brought grandma once while she was visiting, she had the hh tacos. Loved them so much we had to come back the next day. Always get the wings extra crispy and all flats, not many places will do all flats. Bonus points for that. Union Jack on tap, sweet. If ur into sports, big big screens everywhere. We came here once on a whim because it was close to house and now we are regulars."}
{"text":"I was debating between 1 and 2 stars; I'm trying to find some reason not to down-grade it.    Service was terrible!  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  It seemed like that's what we did for the entire 1 and 1/2 hours we were there.  Waited to get our orders in, waited to get drinks, waited (1/2 hour) for food to arrive, waited to complain about the order not being right, waited (12 minutes) for a missing order of french fries, waited another 15 minutes for our check.  I couldn't wait to get out of there.  It's not like it's gourmet food served with fine linens.  It's fried chicken served in small cardboard trays, for crying out loud!  The food was good (when it arrived) but it was way overpriced for what you get.  It was like fancy Chicken McNuggets with \"Special\" BBQ sauce... Won't go back."}
{"text":"My server was Kyle he was awesome checked on us frequently, I ordered traditional wings and I expressed to please make them extra extra crispy. Once they came out I bit into one long and behold the wing was still alive. I expressed my concerned to kyle and he was very apologetic even tried to get them remade for me, at this point I was discussed. Manager NEVER made an attempt to come over and apologize for the issue will NEVER come to this location again."}
{"text":"The bartender was horrible. I got the wrong wings. It was whatever I let it go. She hasn't checked up on me at all. She was busy talking to her friends. I had to ask a waitress for a to go box since she was so busy talking to her friends. Thank you to the waitress but I won't come back to this location."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a hand full of times, and I always walk out of the restaurant not very pleased. I do enjoy the taste of the boneless wings, but sometimes they don't have enough sauce on them. I enjoy the atmosphere, but here is the main reason I give it only one star this last visit.  It seems their policy is to have the customer pay for every extra thing requested. We ordered Chile con queso for the appetizer. But my kids wanted a little salsa on the side. That was $1 charge. They didn't give us enough chips to finish the queso, so for refill of chips =$1. Refill of milk =$1. My son ordered kids meal of wings... But wanted ranch with it =  +$.69. Want more ranch than they give you? = $.69 extra for each. (They don't even fill the very small cups of ranch to the top.) There menu items are over priced making the extra stuff not work the price.  So overall, we will be getting our wings at their competitor from now on (Unless we get coupons or gift cards). It is a shame as this \"was\" my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is one of our favorite places to eat. The atmosphere is perfect and the food is always good, but we had lunch there and they set a timer to have our lunch ready in 15 minutes if we ordered from the timer, I did. My lunch came out way before my families to ensure that they served my lunch before that 15 minutes and I found myself with my food before my families and it sucked. I would suggest getting rid of the timers, when your food is ready it's ready. I would have rather waited to get my food with my family and all eat together. I know not to eat there for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was Buffalo Wild Wings for dinner and everyone was so happy! I'd never ordered to-go before and the hostess was so helpful with helping me figure out how much to order, making suggestions of menu items to try and just overall having a great, positive attitude! I was surprised that they offered healthy menu items like salads and just loved our food!! Will definitely be coming back!! Thank you for the excellent for and great service!!"}
{"text":"ok food....but way to much bbq sauce!! service was ok...but only as long as your having food! went on the patio, to finish our drinks, and asked waitresses walking by really fast, not even looking at us,  asked , too find out why we had been served for over 35 plus minutes. no one came by...ever!! funny..it was ok if we went up to the bar, they would fill individual drink orders. some how, some where, some body, made the decision that \"we\" had enough. as \"we\" left, I tried to speak to the manager,  but no one would step forward, and assume any responsibilty  for the (s-word-ee) service!! it should not be a big deal, to ask for the manager on duty!! I tried to REALLY give this place a chance!! But the 1 star reviews really match MY EXPERIENCE!!  If we were alittle loud, and we may have beenm they failed miserablly in doing their job!!! All they had to do was to come by, and mention something to us..BUT THEY DIDN'T EVEN DO THAT!!   Didn't deliver additional napkins the 1st time...etc...YOU NAME IT...IT WAS A 1 !!! IF I COULD GO NEGATIVE  I WOULD!!  I am 66 years old!! I had 2 beers..!! .REALLY WEAK BEERS..IN 3 HOURS!! and it has been the worst service i've ever had. The same kind of service that closed \"Margueritaville\" DOWN AS WELLl. hey!!! h e l l o....BWW  !! you can learn alot from hot n juicy...across the way!!  they will end up closing you down!!   AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!! IF YOU HAVE OUT OF TOWN GUESTS??  IT IS A MUST!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could write a review for the food, but I never received mine. We were with a somewhat large party and they only gave us one server. I ordered with everyone else and never received my meal. When the manager asked if I needed anything, I told him \"yes, my lunch.\" He laughed it off and said that it probably never got put in and walked away, like he thought it was funny and didn't really give a crap. Then he came back later and asked what my favorite flavor was. Not sure what he was getting at, but too late pal, the rest of my party was already finished and trying to leave. It took them almost an hour to get my husband the bill (fortunately, the food I ordered and the pepsi I received wasn't on there). I'm not coming back to this location. The parking SUCKS and the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Stopped by here recently with a friend.  We wanted to get some beers and Brew Kettle was closed (even though it was 11:30 pm on a Friday??).  We both got some drinks and split 15 wings.  The place seemed almost TOO clean... if that makes sense.  It felt like it was just built and hadn't been \"broken in\" yet as a bar... like everything was just constructed and unwrapped yesterday.  It is a chain though, and all chains are like that to some extent.  No actual complaints though.  Good service.  Wings did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Each time I've ordered food from Buffalo Wild Wings in Strongsville OH in the last month, I've gotten ROTTEN celery!  And minimal sauce on my wings!!!! Seriously can't they see they are giving out garbage?!?!"}
{"text":"The lunch bartender \"robin\" is a very rude person I asked for a menu and she told me to fetch one from the hostess mind you she wasn't busy or anything and then ignores me for over 20 mins I finally decide to just go order at the takeout then once I return to the bar area she comes up to me and makes a rude comment about me ordering there she has been rude to me on multiple occasions I finally left a review because enough is enough I will be complaining to management"}
{"text":"Very slow service(50 minute wait).  Did not get us kids menus.   Salad had brown lettuce.    This is not a good place to take kids."}
{"text":"Sports bar with a focus on wings.  There's a crazy amount of TVs here so its good for watching the game and they promote what they call a \"table-gate\" experience but I've not been there during a live football game so I can't comment to that.  I kind of wish I could give this place 3.5 stars because while the meat quality isn't anything to write home about, they do sport quite a good variety of flavors as well as dry rub flavors with both bone in and boneless styles.  *Serves coke products"}
{"text":"Bartender needs an attitude adjustment. Instead of treating customers like an inconvenience. She didn't even say thanks, have a nice night, or thanks for coming in...etc. worst customer service I have ever experienced, from beginning to end. We would have had more than one drink if we weren't treated this way. We will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I'm a huge BWW fan but this is the only location where I receive great service every visit! The blazin wings and fries are my fav! The servers are always generous to me, wish the food wait wasn't so long but it's worth the wait (:"}
{"text":"Never fails for something to go wrong at this location. I love the food but there has not been one time when I have came here & something has not gone wrong. The staff never brings me my veggies, out of  all the 4 times I've gone to this location. The veggies are supposed to come with the wings unless it's a \"wing day\" from what I know.  The staff takes forever to check if you need a refill. One time they brought me 4 wings when I ordered 5 and accidentally charged me for extra wings. Another time they  gave me a completely different order from my original order and the food was cold. If I do come to this location it's not by choice it's with my friends but I warn them and they witness it every time."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I ever paid for. Nothing special here.  Loud, over  the top foul language at the bar seems to be just fine and acceptable by management. I know it is a bar but this was in the afternoon with families present. Not cool.  Staff seemed nice enough but under trained and not so happy. Save your time and money."}
{"text":"Today was not a good day for this BWW. Final update: After the 55 minute wait, I was informed the order I placed didn't reach the kitchen until I got there. This is in spite of my initial call to the restaurant to make sure it was confirmed. The manager (A.J)never spoke to me, even after my return visit because they'd forgotten my wings. Cashier (Cheryl?)did her best to apologize but she's hardly the one at fault. Very disappointing. 2 hours of failure.  Waited an extra 40 minutes so far for my online order to be complete. Offered drinks by the cashier during the wait but manager hasn't spoken to me once. Slight disappointment on an otherwise solid streak of service."}
{"text":"I remember the first time I went to Las Vegas (circa 2004) and started my 'career' as a live boxing fan, my friend Steve would take me here when I came in on Fri nights.   I'm not going to repeat what the previous reviewers have said, but I think the biggest gimmick for me was the hot sauces that had a rating from 1 to 10. Naturally being an egomaniac, I asked them to give me a 10. I just remember after eating those wings, sweat was starting to build on my forehead. The funniest part though was that I had an instinct wipe my eyes off, but I had the damn hot sauce on my fingers so it was a hilarious scene as I got up blind and attempted to walk myself into the employee's area and grab ice to put on my eye.  I found the service to be better than what the others have said. They were fast enough for my moderate attitude. You usually know when I want to be served when I get my own drinks in the back area anyways.  The food? Nothing spectacular, but it's filling and I usually had a good night after eating there. That isn't to say there were other 'resources' making it a better night ;-)"}
{"text":"*BEWARE*  This was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I ordered takeout. I ordered fried pickles with extra Chipotle ranch. I also wanted potato wedges, 5 boneless wings honey barbecue and 5 boneless parm garlic. I also ordered a sweet tea when I arrived. The cashier asked me twice if my tea was sweetened or unsweetened and after saying sweetened, he hands me my tea.  The manager was very nice and asked if I wanted to check my wings before leaving. I said no because they were crazy busy and I didn't want to be a burden. She also read back my order, so I trusted her and trusted my order was correct.  When I arrived at my apartment, I realized my tea was unsweetened. Whatever, I thought and I added my own sugar. I also realized I had 5 traditional garlic parm wings instead on boneless. This made me sad and disappointed I did not accept the offer of looking at my food before leaving. Besides that everything was great. Nothing tasted out of the ordinary.  About 4 hours later, I'm woken up by horrible stomach pains. I mean, worse than menstrual cramps, gas pains, worse than someone stabbing my uterus and lower stomach over and over with a dull knife pain. I try to go back to sleep, but suddenly my stomach is so upset. I lay still, hoping it'll pass. Suddenly, I'm running to the bathroom with painful diarrhea, worsening cramps, and I'm vomiting at the same time. This cycle continued for the next 38 hours. I had to call off work. The DAY of, because I was still vomiting and could not leave the bathroom. They owe me 13 hours at $12 an hour because that's the shift I missed out on. I'll never feel the same way about this restaurant or wings ever again. I've never had food poisoning before, but after researching the symptoms and knowing the wings were the only thing I had eaten in over 24 hours, I know this location gave me food poisoning. It was a horrible experience that still sickens me to think about. I did not feel 100 percent okay, normal, healthy for 3 full days.  *BEWARE*"}
{"text":"We went on Friday Sept 2. Tony was our server. He was awesome. Friendly, great customer service and overall fun.  It was out third time ever at BWW and the food for the first time was great. Tony offered great customer service and ideas on food and beer. We left beyond satisfied and happy. The manager, a male, Was also really cool.   We had a great time with Tony. Wish we had servers like him in California. Thank you Tony"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service of any BWW I've ever been to.  Took over 40 mins to get lunch wings from \"fast break\" menu on a slow Monday, and the bartender couldn't have cared less when we asked what was taking so long.  Unless you like overpriced wings and being ignored, stay away from this location!"}
{"text":"When we first got there we were told we would be seated in a small both contingent on another spot opening soon so we could see our game... when a spot opened the waitress told us to move. Soon after the manager told us to move again because he had another party coming. The manager was very rude and stand offish....made NO attempt to accommodate us, we felt totally bullied. Will never give them my business again"}
{"text":"Selection of sauces for the wings...excellent.  Service staff a little pushy on try this or try this.  This visit the server was pushing French fries that can be made with any of the wings sauces.  Would be okay for those who eat fries...I do not.  I have this thing about food joints with napkin rolled silverware.  When there are no other napkins available you have a choice of placing your silverware on a table wiped with a dish towel of unknown cleanliness or going without a napkin so your silverware can rest on it.  Had to ask for extra napkins so BWW doesn't get it.  Food is quite good."}
{"text":"This location might actually have had the best service of the Charlotte area stores but it's in the proverbial transitional area.  My car, sitting within 25 feet of the front door on a busy Monday night (football game etc.), was broken into.  Perhaps not their fault but the risk outweighs the reward for returning."}
{"text":"Heard that the wings here were super delish, so had to give it a try.  I ordered like some sort of honey hot, and they were scorching, which is exactly how i like em!!  So kudos on the wings...umm the service was great when we frist got there.  Our server was super sarcastic and funny and really had us going.  Then she's like \"I'm gonna be off now, so Kristen is gonna take care of you\"  Boo!  I hate when you switch servers, it's almost never as good.  You can pretty much expect to be ignored.  So we get \"Kristen\" or \"Christine\" I dont remember or care to since she never came over to say hi.  We had to wave her down to order some more beer.  She was very quiet and no fun at all.  I wish our server wasn't going home!!!  So then I notice that the table next to us is the one that all the employees sit at to eat their food and drink at when their off.  Awkward.  Don't really want to hear about how much money you did or didn't make and how many dousche bags you served tonight.  The manager was nice though.  He came over and said hi.   I'd say it was only great cuz of the first server and the  wings, after that, it was kinda just ok.  I would go back though and hope the first server was there."}
{"text":"What is it about BWW? I love their wings, but the service SUCKS at very one I've ever been to. This one fits that same mo,d; good food, SLOW service."}
{"text":"Here's the deal  After work we stopped in for some drinks well my boss was paying as he went & the rest of us had a tab. Well after about 1 1/2hrs. It was time to go. So the bartender brings everyone's bill including a bill for my boss, who has been paying as he went.  So he says to her that he shouldn't even have a bill that he's been paying right along. She basically tells him he's full of shit. So the so called manager comes over & all he does is count the beers in the cooler & didn't have a clue what to do. I was ready to rip the place apart but he didn't want no trouble if the cops came. (Maybe a dui when we leave) so he payed twice. And my other coworker said their was an extra beer on his tap & once again she basically said she was right & he was wrong. So I guess if you want to take a chance on getting ripped off go there if not stay clear!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a single salad and an order of wings online.  The order was supposed to be picked up at 9:40.  35 minutes past my pickup time, my food was finally ready.  I asked why it took so long and they said they prioritized seated patrons before me.  A manager couldn't even be bothered to come talk to me.  She came out talked to the server helping me and then disappeared back in to the kitchen again without so much as a \"sorry we are behind.\"  Update:  Tried going back one more time and they messed up my order.  I asked for a burger with no onions (allergy) and it had them.  I showed them and the waitress said \"One moment, they had another one they were making already.\"  When they brought it out, it was the same burger with some (not all) of the onions scraped off.  They may end up killing someone with a more severe allergy.  Manager never bothered calling me back.  Done.  PS. The kiosks have a security vulnerability that they won't fix.  Only use cash if you do end up going there."}
{"text":"It looks like I'm not the only one writing a poor review. Almost 20 minutes for all of our drinks to arrive, we had to suggest she put our appetizer order in (cheese curds, they are bomb) then we waited so long for our main course (wings) we had to ask if we could just get them to go. The server mentioned that the food was in the window so she packaged it herself. Of course some of the food was cold and part of the order messed up which we did not notice until we were heading out the parking lot running late to get home. This was last Sunday, it was busy, but well staffed. We just had a lousy server. The two others I was with love the place, yet it was my first visit. 2 adults, 1 kid, plus 3 drinks was over $100 with the tip. I expected more."}
{"text":"This BDUBS is amazing! Go in there all the time. The staff and the food are excellent. Going in this saturday for UFC 200 which they show now and they have no cover which you can't beat."}
{"text":"Not quite the good experience I've had at other BWW's, but it was OK.  Kitchen sent me two wilted salads in a row.  As usual the wings were pretty tasty, the carrot sticks and celery were super crispy-fresh.  Their bleu cheese dressing is some of the worst I've tasted.   But I really do like their wings, and the server and manager were friendly.  Not a bad gamble coming here, but don't expect wonderful, they have quality control issues at this store."}
{"text":"Did not have a great experience.  This was our first time at any Buffalo Wild Wings and will be the last.  First, We asked the waitress if the wings are naked and she did not know and had to go ask and did not come back for a very long time.  There is a flavor we eat at other places quite often so we went with that one.  It was so awful we could not eat it, we told her and she sent over a manager and he said \"well we are different\".  I asked is there a sauce you could bring so we could try and eat our wings he replied \"like what\"? I said how about BBQ. He brought over some BBQ, no one ever came and asked again if it helped or anything.  I understand we chose the item but it was our first time and they were just rude about it."}
{"text":"Theres always great food and drink specials. Great atmosphere for girls night out or for friends to come together for the big game or big fight. Wings are awesome of course, and I love how they will bring you any kind of sauce you want to try! Service has been good to me so far, except for one occasion where the waitress literally had us get our drinks from the bar instead of bringing them to us :/ kinda rude!"}
{"text":"me and my girls are here all the time. The food specials are great and the service is good too. The wings of course are the main attraction here and they are as delicious as they seem. Tip: if you like your wings drenched in sauce, you have to let them know that! the atmosphere is very casual, and nice to have dinner with friends to watch the big game or the big fight."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and the food is usually good with good service.  We took a chance today and came on New Years Day, knowing it would be busy.  When we got there the front area was packed with people waiting to put their name on the list to be seated.  We waited for 5 minutes and never got acknowledged.  The hostess seemed more concerned about cleaning tables than taking names.  The worst part was when a person walked in and went to the \"to go\" cashier and asked about the wait.  The hostess then took his name and still didn't even take the names of the people waiting in her line.  Needless to say a couple of us walked out at that point.  This used to be a BW3 we came to, but I'll go to one with better customer service."}
{"text":"I'll take a systematic approach here:  Clean..friendly atmosphere. Service: Could use some improvement. Took the server 20 minutes before coming over to our table to take our order. A little slow with the drink. 15 minutes before our alcoholic beverages were serve.  Another 20 minutes before food is brought out.  Total time from being seated and eating: approximately 55 minutes. Lets just call it an hour.  Fries: A little soggy. Wings: Acceptable,. Nothing out of the ordinary.  Overall, I've had a better experience at other BWW.....    The only thing that saved it from getting a 2-star: Good wings.   Cheers"}
{"text":"HUUUGE FAN of BDUBS however this experience was terrible. Wife and I just came from buying a house and COULDN'T BE HAPPIER, LITERALLY! Needs improvement on service. Waited an abnormally long time for drinks(OK, no big deal, lets see what happens) and then the same just to take the food order(ok we're psyched we just bought a house and we have a BDUBS around the corner)!Waitress had a HORRIBLE attitude and couldn't wait to get her tip. She was extremely rude and more attentive after bill was paid and cleared off the table one dish at a time on purpose to see if she could grab the signed bill. I was just trying to finish my beer while my wife got our son ready to put in the car seat. I would never use a waitress' name to \"out her\" as this is their livelihood. I wouldn't like someone to get fired but I hope this would be addressed in a pre-Shift meeting. I have never been so disappointed and  angry as I was at that moment. I even gave it a week to decide to write this or not so my emotions wouldn't dictate what I write. Come on BWW lets get this right!"}
{"text":"I love B-Dubs! That is Buffalo Wild Wings for those of you from the west coast. Being originally from Michigan this place use to be called BW-3's in the late 90's, and was always referred to as BDubs. At some point in time it changed to Buffalo Wild Wings and blew up around the country! When I first moved to Arizona there was only one BDubs, now we have about 10, thank god! I moved out to the westside and frequent this place often. The atmosphere is excellent especially for all sports enthusiasts. I have only had the wings and a few appetizers, so I cannot comment on the menu. To be honest the wings is all you need. They have so many flavors about 14, I've tried and enjoyed them all. I usually sit in the bar area which is filled with pretty much any liquor you want along with a nice assortment of tap beers about 15-20 kinds. They have a killer deals throughout the week, my favorite is on tuesdays with 40 cent wings. To wrap it up... If you like sports, beers, and wings, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely experience here last evening. We were seated at a table, and when we asked to be moved to a booth, they were very accommodating.  Dinner was hot and exactly as we ordered it. The waitress was kind and always got us what we needed."}
{"text":"Thursday around 230 PM, I pick my girlfriend up from work and we head over here to try this place out after mulling it over for a few weeks. The parking lot seemed decently filled but when we walk in, there were 4-5 employees hanging out at the front counter with a relatively empty seating area.   We smile upon entry and all employees at the front stare at us blankly until one asks if we are here for pick up. We decline and say we would like to dine in. They talk about available booths before one goes to check on one. Meanwhile a group comes in and crams their way in between us and the employee that was going to seat us (we were about a foot and a half away from the server, by the way) and they have some confusion about a seating arrangement. We get seated after they decide to figure out the other customers afterward.   We sit for a moment before our server comes to ask us what we want to drink and if we are ready to order. We order some iced teas and then state we need a few minutes. My girlfriend started to speak up for her order when another employee interrupts to tell our server to do something whenever he finished with us. While I was ordering -mind you I've never been here- I wasn't sure how the process went. I got the naked tenders and I was waiting for the server to maybe prompt me to pick a sauce but he just kinda stared at me.   Three times I saw servers bring tables the wrong food, including once to our table. Our food finally gets to us and my first bite of these naked tenders is one of those bites where you instantly question if your food is cooked. I moved on to another piece of chicken and the rest were pretty cooked. My girlfriend and I both liked her wing choice.   We ate pretty fast and got our bill, then sat there at the table for ten min or longer before the server picked it up to process. Once we got the receipt back to sign, we were given a red pen to sign with.  All in all, we probably should have left before we even ordered our drinks because our initial gut feeling wasn't promising. Our server was decently nice and he still got a good tip, but there was no sincerity or connections made at all, let alone a lack of customer service."}
{"text":"My family and I come here a lot!! Tony has served us a few times and he is always on top of it!! He's nice, knows the menu and always offers good suggestions!! Also he's the only server so far to get my fiancé another beer before it's empty lol"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would . We've been waiting over an hour for our lunch and the waitresses excuse is that it was due to my wings needing to be well done . I'm very disappointed . I will no longer be coming here and would never recommend anyone to come here ."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the sauces that I get at Buffalo Wild Wings.  I usually do their Tuesday special for traditional wings.  I wanted to try the new sauce but wasn't sure I wanted to commit to having wings with the new sauce.  My service brought out some fries and the new sauce to see if I wanted to have it.  I decided against it, but I thought it was a really nice gesture to let me sample it.   The service was nice, it wasn't busy, and the food was good.  All things I have come to expect from Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE.  Couldn't get the order correct and had to go back to correct THEIR error.  When I requested to speak to the manager, I was not directed to him/her.  My fault for not heeding the terrible Yelp warning."}
{"text":"Great Wings, great service.  The servers are very helpful and will let you try sauces before hand to help you decide.  The service is fast and efficient. And, they have cold Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale on tap.  I don't, as a rule, like chains, but this is an exception.  I'm rating it hghly because no chain I've ever been in is anywhere near this good."}
{"text":"If you're crazy for wings like I am then this place is the right place for you!! They have really good variety of flavors, their fries are delicious & so is their ranch and their other sauces."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time to this location and it's gone from bad to worse. I can't believe the servers and hosts stand around talking knowing people are waiting to be seated or served.  Tonight was the best! We got the \"we're waiting for a table to be cleaned\" excuse, but they were all clean the hostess was just trying to finish her conversation.  We finally get seated and order. Someone tries to bring us another tables appetizer TWICE. Might I mention we never got the appetizer we ordered (probably ended up at another table). Wings came out cold-seriously! The only good thing was the onion rings which is just sad and the only reason I gave them one star. The best part...my husband asks for the check and is signing the receipt when the server throws a used paper towel into my husbands beer glass (which was a little less then half full). When he saw the look on my husband face he asked \"sorry we're you done with that\"? Yeah buddy we're done with this place all together.  I'll drive the extra miles to another BWW any day!"}
{"text":"The service is utterly terrible. It's dirty, service again is terrible, wait times to even get a sweet tea took 20 minutes. And it was super slow...Our waitress checked on us maybe 2. MAYBE. Our silverware also had dry chili stuck. And my sweet tea had a piece of dirty  plastic. Never again will I come here. All I wanted was some wings and I got plastic in my drink and dried chili on my silverware."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst bww I have ever been to. Lazy late night bartender was more interested in flirting with other dudes than paying attention to our party. Took about 30 min to get a drink order then he  messed up the food order. Terrible"}
{"text":"VERY LOUD!! Don't come here for a first date, or with a bunch of friends, if you're a chatty group. It's damn near impossible to hear each other, let alone the waitresses.   Food is good--expensive, but yummy. The wings are on a scale of \"hotness\", but as a lightweight in the spicy department, I found their hot wings were mild.   Expect to pay around .45 cents for extra ranch, which comes in a tiny container."}
{"text":"I'll give it two stars because my chicken soft tacos were pretty good. Unfortunately:    - They brought out everyone's food except one person. It was at least 10 minutes before her food came. The waitress never came to the table one time during that 10 minutes. - Waitress was overhead by someone in our party, while walking to the bathroom, saying how she didn't care if we thought it was bad service.  - Most people ordered boneless chicken wings. They came out in tiny little paper trays like you'd see at a state fair. No extras, no real plate, just soggy wings piled into a paper tray.  - Other waitresses walked by and finally one offered to get two of us water. We were waiting for about 15 minutes with empty glasses. - The food took about half an hour to come out, despite the place being nearly empty on a Thursday night.  - Their beer \"specials\" were $5.75 for a Dos Equis, $3.75 for a Bud Lite. I asked how much for a Sam Adams and she told me $4.50. It was $6.50.  I can't say we'll ever be back again. There are so many other places to get wings."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have had at a restaurant  By far ! Got to the the restaurant beyond packed football game no surprise was told it would be 15 to 20 min after waiting for nearly 40 sat down for 15 min till our waitress came along for the first time Nicole was the worst person I have ever had note that I go to buffalo wild wing at least 1 to 2 times a month great food but the service was absolutely terrible today ended with her hovering over us until we gave her a tip which she basically grabbed out of our hands some friendly advice if you get her simply ask for a different server save yourself the disappointment she brings not coming back to this location"}
{"text":"It took 7 minutes to even greet us at the table. All the servers and hospos were up at the front looking at us while we were looking around for a server. To make matters worse during this 7 minutes the manager was check in with all the tables to see how everything was going and skipped our table completely."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy B-dubs on Thursday for boneless wings but not today. They were all breaded with hardly any meat and they were very dry and crunchy. Not my favorite thing. And they upped the price."}
{"text":"Just sitting here for about 15 minutes waiting for another beer....maybe clear the dirty dishes off the table.... come by and just see how we are doing. Ya know all the things you expect that 20% tip for but will call me a dick when yon dont get it.... its been a long time since I've set foot in a BWW for this very reason. Great to see somethings don't change."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. It seems that both times the service has been really poor. We wait way too long and the wait staff seems very rushed even though I see them standing around talking. its frustrating when I have to wave someone down to get a water refill. my favorite sauces are the original hot and asian zing. I tasted the difference between the honey BBQ and sweet BBQ I definitely prefer the honey BBQ. It has this extra little something to it that I like. If the service was better I would come back but for now I'll be looking for a different location."}
{"text":"I enjoy grabbing some wings after a hard days work. Usually, I go to the premium south outlets but I heard that this one opened at PH and thought I would save myself the drive and walk over. It's huge. I'm not 100% sure but I think it's a little more expensive by a couple of dollars. My waitress, Shay, was very friendly and informative. She had lots of suggestions in case you don't know what you want and has an understanding of the full menu. As someone who works in customer service I appreciate when I receive good service. She was very professional and was very prompt to taking care of our needs. The food was hot and fresh. It couldn't have come out any better. I will probably come more often."}
{"text":"The reason for my  3 stars is because of the past 3 experiences smh... We have ordered our family dinners 3x in a row now an the orders haven't been to bad, but the service was terrible. Every time we ordered an paid for extra ranch we only recieved 1 every time. If it weren't for my fiance I wouldn't come back due to the last time today. We ordered online an when we got there we ordered 4 extra ranches... Why i didnt check I do not know but i wish i did because we only have ONE once again!!!! I don't feel to bad cause the dude in front of us his order was wrong to which makes me wish i would have checked mines cause i would have turned around to. Wish this place had better staff."}
{"text":"I lOoOOove Buffalo wings! I crave them, especially if they are crispy and spicy! They have so many different sauces here. If you like Hot HOT HOTTTT but deliciously sweet & then spicy, try the mango habanero sauce. Don't order too many like I did my first time because you may not be able to finish them all.  We went on a night where they had 49 cent discount wings so the price was pretty good and we split 50 amongst the 4 of us, which was more than enough. The potato cheese wedges were good too. There are a million TVs galore plus huge screens there to watch sports on everywhere you look. I counted 8 in one corner! I'm not a sports fan but if you are, I guess this is a good place to go. Service was good but maybe a tad bit slow. It was pretty packed though when I went. The wings are definitely worth the blaring TVs and slower service though."}
{"text":"Went to B-Dubs to watch Kobe's last game. Had the Pulled pork and fries with a Stella. Great sandwich very moist and flavorful. The atmosphere was good but service was slow. Waitress was friendly but more interested in closing duties then providing a high level of service. If you are looking for a good sports environment BW's is a decent choice. Not great but good!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great beer selection and the salt & vinegar wings are amazing. Staff is really friendly too. Nice to have TVs where they change to something different if you ask."}
{"text":"always a good time here.and it can bring back the memory i had in ohio...and happy hour is def an A+.....3 dollar for any domestic draft and 3 dollars for quite a few selections on the appetizers,also wings are 50 cents each...hell ya"}
{"text":"Ordered burger. Waitress said that they couldn't do the burger well done. Had to be med. What kind of place can't make a burger well done? Ordered the cheesesteak instead. Not good at all. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Why did I keep eating??  Basically, you come here for those deep fried delicacies known as boneless wings.  I've tried the potato wedges, burgers, wraps, and salads, and all are average at best.  Don't waste the stomach space.  There are many sauces to choose from, my favorite being the spicy Mango Habanero sauce.    Here's what you do:    Call in an order of about 20 boneless wings just for yourself on a football Sunday.  Make sure nobody is home of course, this is going to be a shamefeast.  When you return with your saucy bounty, close the curtains, lock the doors, and get carnivorous.  Nobody likes a quitter, so just like a marathon runner you'll have to push through.  Yep, I just compared running a marathon to stuffing your face with boneless wings.  SHAZAM!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch any sporting event or UFC.  The food always comes out fast and hot!  They have a very friendly staff and always make you feel welcome!  Great job Bdubs!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! I don't mind the food here but when you have a nasty miserable server it really ruins your experience ........."}
{"text":"I will echo the other reviews that service is slow and painful here. We waited about 35-40 minutes for an order that would have taken 10 at any other Bdubs. The poor waiter was not even apologetic until we handed him payment. Food was as good as any other location, but the service made the meal barely worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome drinks, wonderful service. Best place in town to watch a game. Bryant was an excellent bartender and I will be back next Sunday !!"}
{"text":"I give this place the benefit of the doubt every time simply because I am a wing lover and sometimes it's spectacular... other times not so much. My favorite is the Asian zing. The last time I was there, there was a storm outside that caused their computer systems to crash. Me and my buddies were all using card to pay. We sat for a good 30 minutes after we had already finished our food waiting for their system to reboot so they could run our cards. In the mean time we suggested they write down our card #'s and run the payment when the system booted back up. They declined. I offered to leave my ID and contact info so I could leave and return the next day. This offer was also declined. So we sat and waited. Eventually the system went back up and we were able to pay, but still, I don't think the customer should be inconvenienced, period. We tipped our server (did not let this reflect on her service), but did let the manager on duty about the inconvenience. Haven't returned since... maybe will try again and see if the demeanor is different"}
{"text":"I'm not a wings or fried chicken kind of person. I never cared for the veiny bones. However, I liked how they have boneless wings where you don't have to deal with the bones. There must be a lot of people that feel that way. The wings were pretty tasty and I liked their different dips. The service from what I recall was fairly good."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge wings person because of the veins. However, the boneless wings weren't bad. I didn't know they came with all the sauces. I didn't care for most of them. The steak wrap I got was good. The waitress was good for the most part until she tried to hint to us to leave, saying is there anything else or are you ready to go. I've never had anyone say that to me in a restaurant before. I know it was busy, but it was plain rude."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  First time it was great.  Second time they got our order of 50 wings wrong and then did not put the order in to fix it for 20 min.  The manager did make that visit right.  Last visit never got a waitress for almost 20 min!  Don't know how long it would of taken.  Ended up walking out!"}
{"text":"Everything took so long make!!!!!!   15 minutes for vodka and pineapple juice. Which by the way was served in a shot glass. One order of wings took 40 minutes. The waitress was more interested in talking to her co-workers than providing service. We were there for 2 hours or so and the waitress check on us 5 times. No bueno."}
{"text":"Solid place that I use for call-in to-go orders. Only reason it comes in at 4 stars instead of three is the fact that the service level remains high should I have to wait for any length of time"}
{"text":"Came to this place with a co worker on a Friday after a long day of work drank 2 bottled coronas after 35 minutes, the waitress came around and asked if we needed anything, we ordered another round and I was told she couldn't serve me so much beer literally after 2 beers I asked what the limit was she said it was up to her I wasn't drunk or even a little buzzed I truly don't know why I was told that, made me feel like a drunk in front of my co worker and the people that sat next to us I was humiliated will not be returning. We left after that and went to the hooter across the street where the service was amazing."}
{"text":"I only come here for wings and fried pickles but not the regular wings I love flat wings  in the bone but not  the meaty ones , they do charge extra for flats wich don't make any sence since it's less meat but I guess  it's because they have to separate them ?  Don't know . Anyways I love their wings and f4i3d pickles are so yummi  , if you don't want to be in the crowd just call ahead and order to go ."}
{"text":"Decent food, but the service is needlessly slow in the dining room. Wings are passable, not really big. Fans of the New England style \"Wings Over\" chain or Anchor Bar will be dissatisfied.  Good selection of sauces, but the hot brings only heat, no real spice flavor."}
{"text":"Walked in had some college kids (2) ahead of us. Server sat them right away. Came back 5 mins later. Had (2) college kids come in after us. Was asked how many were in our party. We had two adults and three children. So we asked for two high chairs. Was told it would be a min. So we sat. Had a couple come in and was immediately seated. Then (4) more college kids came in. Immediately was also seated. Then our table was ready. As we sat we looked around. Only two families were seated on this side of the room. Floors have food and trash around each table. And tables haven't been cleared or wiped down. Servers are not helpful and will ignore you. But we were hungry and what to get started on ordering. We ordered the house sampler. (Horrible, food has a horrible, not fresh taste.) Popcorn shrimp. (Was good taste, but server forgot we ordered it, more then once) server never checked on us. So we sat and waited ten mins. Then asked for a manager. Bonus was the server giving me a dirty look for talking to the manager. Will not return"}
{"text":"I use to love this location but it seems to have gone down hill lately. I've been there 3 times within the last month and there's always been something wrong during each visit.  1st visit was during night time like past midnight type of thing. Sat at the bar order just a soda and was gambling. Finished my soda and I was never asked if I wanted a refill or something else to drink. After about $60 bucks in I finally paid for my one soda and left  2nd visit was late in the evening with my family. We were sat down right away which surprised me cause it was Sunday and the games were on. Everything was going good until it came time for our food. Ordered mini corn dogs to start the kids off and about 10mins later they inform us that they ran out. No big deal happens but then I ordered a bacon burger and another 10 minutes later we get informed that they are out of bacon. Alright not a happy guy but not upset. I switch to there chicken sandwich instead and I get my food and the chicken is chewy. We got a quesadilla and hardly any cheese on the inside. It was a waste of $50 honestly for our dinner.  3rd visit was me alone during lunch hour. I sit down, gamble $20, order a soda and then try to order a bacon burger but am told they don't have just a bacon burger. That all they have is a bacon cheese burger. I ask the bartender if it's possible to order and pay the price of the bacon cheese burger and just have no cheese on it. I'm told no that it has to be as it is in the menu. Ok so I go with that and order it. I finish my soda and literally see people sit around me order drinks and food and pay and my soda is still haven't been refilled or I haven't been asked if I want something else to drink. I put my empty cup towards the edge and still nothing. It is not until I am done with my food and ask for the bill that I am offered a refill!   Like really took you that long to ask me? I work as a bartender and a soda refill takes 10-20seconds! Now person behind the bar might be thinking since I'm not drinking that I will not tip good so maybe that's why I don't get service but I know how it is behind the bar so I always tip $10 even if all I getting is a simple soda.   So to end this review, bar service sucks as a refill is almost impossible to get. Don't go on Sundays cause apparently they run out of everything. This place was great but service is horrible now and I don't see why cause it's always busy so employees are making there money here."}
{"text":"Do I dare say it? Yes, yes I do...I think I like this place better than Wing Stop. Too bad the nearest location in my area is about an hour drive away. Gah! Anyway, here's what my friend and I had:  Southwest Dippers - These li'l things had a mighty tasty filling of pepper jack cheese, tomato, onion, jalapeno, corn and black beans. The ranch dip balanced the heat level nicely.  Traditional Spicy Garlic Wings - For some strange reason, the spicy part overpowered the garlic. I was only able to manage two of these. Yes, I'll admit I can be a weakling at times when it comes to spicy things, aite?!  Traditional Honey BBQ Wings - Although I have yet to try all of the other flavors, I think this one is the best. I'm more than likely to order this again the next time I come around here. Best believe there will be a next time.   We also ordered some Traditional Mild Wings to go for our friends back at the hotel. They even tried our leftovers and said that everything was good. BWW has earned itself some new fans!"}
{"text":"When youre in the mood for wings, this is the place to go. This particular location is never packed and always clean.  I love the varieties of sauces, so if you want sweet or savory you can have unlimited flavors. You can also have your wings boneless, but I prefer the classic bone in wings. Its always nice and crispy and moist. They serve it to you piping hot so be careful. Great atmosphere, always a treat when you want wings."}
{"text":"Okay if youre giving this place a higher rating then 1 star you have to go to wing school and learn what good chicken wings are.This place gets one star just for the service. The service was great the staff members were friendly and welcoming. We ordered cheese dip and tortilla chip it came in a paper cup with a paper plate it tasted worse then the theater ones, which is just plain sad. Honestly stay away from those they are just gross. The Chicken Tacos are good though. We also ordered two sides fries for about  $4.00 each that also came in a paper bowl  and it was the size of a small Macdonald happy meal fry . What a rip  Then the wings we order hot wings they where hot  Like a BBQ sauce  some what which I absolutely cannot stand. Wings where small nothing like a true wing buff would  like . They could not be considered chicken wings at all. It was all over priced  did I mention that everything  came out in paper bowls also . LOL I was expected a plastic cup for my drink. They do have game pads for your kids. This place reminds me of a chunky cheese for kids and dad can have a beer with his wings . This place needs a dishwasher so they can have dishes cause the paper plates just seem cheap which this place is not. Oh yeah I almost forgot they gave us celery cut so thin I used it to floss my teeth after my meal. See my pictures.  Also see my other wing review from Toronto  Now that's wings. I would never go back to this place .  I have to go to Duffs a few days later to cleanse wings palette and remember how great chicken wings really are."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour after work. The service was horrible. There was not very many people inside, yet we could not get service. It took several minutes to seat 7 of us. The tables were left un-clean, and it took awhile for them to clear them to seat us. After several minutes our waitress Sonia who cleaned the table finally took our drink order, and food order. It took several minutes to get our drinks because Sonia was also playing bartender and pouring out drinks.  The drinks ran dry for several minutes before Sonia asked if we would like another round. Finally she asked us if we wanted another round, and had to pour them herself. Our food still had not arrived, and took a few more minutes before we were served. Overall this was not a good experience.  I have been to Buffalo Wild Wings several times throughout many cities and have never had this kind of service."}
{"text":"This location has started to go downhill.  In the main dining room, they have old TV projectors that have lost their color.  They don't even look HD.  Recently trying to watch the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the TV picture was so bad, you would only see the white of the ice.  The faceoff circle and blue lines could not be seen.   It used to be a \"go-to\" for sports viewing, but that is no longer"}
{"text":"Ordered online Friday and thought by ordering online it would be fast and easy to pick up on my lunch break. When I arrived I had to wait an additional 10 minutes for my food. Wasn't that big of a deal until I got back to work and my food wasn't hot. The chicken wrap was very poorly put together and fries were cold. Also I didn't have any silverware or napkins put in the bag."}
{"text":"I was kinda skeptical about the wings they say are so amazing but it's true!! Great service, clean bathrooms & awesome food!!! I had the juicy steak burger and wasn't disappointed at all!! My waitress was amazing and was on top of all our needs! Coming here more often."}
{"text":"Omygoosh what can I say wings are horrible and too many duschbags in this place I guess that's all they attract jeez"}
{"text":"Service stinks at this location... Went here on a weeknight and the bartender asked us what we would like to order and she forgets to put the order in...  That just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  Took 40 minutes for a hamburger... Asked for a water, no water.... Sorry!  Then when it was time for us to leave, we had to wait 15 minutes for our check...   Oh, and for some reason our check said tap water on it.... LOL!!!!"}
{"text":"Food: atrocious, not to mention mysterious. See photos for evidence.  Ambiance: can't speak for it, picked-up our company lunch from here today  Price: meh, $9.29 for 8 wings with a side of fries plus carrots and celery seems like a good enough of a deal... if you actually get real chicken. Again, reference the photos."}
{"text":"I give this place a very happy three stars.   Got the lunch special 12 boneless wings, fries,  and carrots for $10.   It's a bit steep for a lunch but it the boneless chicken wings were very good,  did not get a bite of tendon or mystery crunch such as you would from other boneless chicken wings.   They let me choose as many flavors as I wanted so I settled for garlic parmesan,  Caribbean jerk,  and mango habanero.  All the flavors covered the wings very generously and were very finger-lickin good!  I loved how they really meant Hot when they marked the mango habanero - No weak sauce here!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the food.  The wings weren't what I remember.  Three stars for a Great atmosphere for sporting events but not for food.  The staff were friendly but our waitress seemed to get lost every now and again and we would need to flag her over.  I don't for see me making any special trips anytime soon.  The kids potions were perfect, however I wish they would've had more combo options for adults... For the wings.  I'm not up to trying anything else on the menu.  The mac n cheese flavorless... Looks creamy but where's the cheese?  The food when it hit the table was not hot, it seemed as if our plates were sitting in the warming window for a while.  The place was busy for a late Sunday afternoon, but it just didn't deliver.  I expected more from BW3... My expectations fell way short."}
{"text":"The recent remodel at this location is a huge upgrade! Greatly improved lighting and decor. New seating, floors, and paint, too!  I love that they now have a LCD Beer Display ---- you can see a rotating list of all the beers on draft as well as the caloric content if you're interested.36 beers on draft including local options from Triptych, Riggs, and Big Thorn.  We stopped by during Happy Hour but didn't partake in any of the specials. The service was quick, beers cold, wings hot, and fries crispy. A winning trip in my eyes."}
{"text":"Went to bdubs for some after midnight grub and the chick with the purple hair had her shit together, i would definitely recommend this location to anyone people."}
{"text":"Our experience was great.  Friendly and fast service.  Our new favorite wing place to eat and watch sports."}
{"text":"The last 3 times I have been here my wings have been burnt with barely any sauce. Service has been slow"}
{"text":"Food is great. Staff is great. All in all a good place for wings and beer. My try the desert heat dry sauce. It's bomb."}
{"text":"Went to watch the Super Ball yesterday with the girl friend, was not very crowded like every other year. Ordered food and drinks. The female bartender was very attentive and the food came super fast despite the restaurant area was packed. This is my neighborhood bar, I don't go there often but very clean place, will go back."}
{"text":"Unorganized from the beginning. Waiter outside was in a bad mood. New waiter was helpful. Food is good but takes too long to arrive. Waited 45 min just to get our check. Definitely not coming back.."}
{"text":"B-dubs won my heart with their selection of wing sauces and plentiful carrots and celery.  Things I appreciate about a chicken wing: plenty of meat on the bone (yes, the bone. Chickens have bones), the opportunity for more than one flavor, and flavorful sauces that won't burn my face off.    My favorite sauce is honey bbq, which is pretty classic.  Asian Zing is very tasty, but it has a little bit of a kick.  And parmesan garlic is actually too strong a flavor!  There are a few others I would like to try, but I won't be venturing farther down the thermometer than Asian Zing.  You can split flavors into increments of 5, so sharing is great if you want to try a few sauces.  I've been in a couple of times to watch games or fights, and the atmosphere is great for that.  Good food that will keep on comin', there's usually a drink special of some kind, and TVs all around for easy viewing.  Keep in mind, if it's a major event making for a busy night, your whole party will need to be present before you will be seated."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  I got their boneless wings in medium sauce and fries.  Our waitress Melissa was great and very friendly.    We had a great time eating and enjoyed the atmosphere.  We ate around 11am and it was pretty quiet and enjoyable.  I love that their wings are always consistent every time we eat here!"}
{"text":"Obviously take out is not something they do well here. Ordered 3 items off the menu...wings, nachos, and a burger. Get home only to find the burger missing and the nacho order was incorrect. Very inconvenient to drive all the way back, search for parking, and then wait 5 minutes only to be told...\"yeah we have your burger in the back\".  Well at least the wings were ok. Never again. :-("}
{"text":"First off the Wings here are GREAT!  Good Flavor and sauce selection.  Some good beers...but mostly  Bud, Miller, Coors etc etc.......Basically crap.  Other than that................OMG REALLY!?!?!?  -Service sucks....bad. (Waited 15 minutes for even a server to come to table)  GO TO THE BAR!!!! -Prices are high -They charge EXTRA for celery?!??! -I ordered 18 wings and got 4 (FOUR) sticks of celery-LOL -Only so many sauce choices per order of wings.  Again wings are great....So coming here for any reason other than to watch a game and enjoy wings......Go elsewhere.  For the $$ you can go eat dinner at the Cheescake Factory for the same price."}
{"text":"I'll be totally honest... The wings and beer here are awesome!  Service at the bar is also fantastic!  Everything else is pretty terrible.  Table service is slow, and the other food choices are mediocre.  The phone at the front desk constantly rings and reminds me of the loud ringing you hear at Home Depot.  Plenty of sports to watch and again the wings are excellent."}
{"text":"Service is okay, but the food sucks...their wings are nasty. For better wings, I'll go to wing stop. Their anti-gun stance is annoying too."}
{"text":"Went and had lunch today sat in the bar with my boyfriend and the server Amerlynn was nice she apologized for the wait, took our drink and food order etc. we came in around 1:30 orderd or lunch combos at 1:45. It took so long to get our food we didn't get it till 2:20! She apologized for the wait but unfortunately the wings looked like they were sitting under the heat lamp for a while. We asked them to fix them and when they came back they were cold so sent them back again..   About 2 min later I saw 1 black male cook and 2 servers come out of the kitchen and stared us down! This is what sent me over the edge. You know they were talking about us and wanted to see who we were so I went to the manager and confronted her and told her how I saw that and how unprofessional it was especially since we are both in the service industry I told her I want her to make sure our food is not being messed with!  The manager gave us a fresh new order which was great my boyfriend worked at Buffalo Wild Wings knows the sauces and noticed when we left that he mouth was even more on fire then normal he order Wild with another sauce mixed in.. he strongly believes and knows that they added like a squirt of blazin in it because he mouth has a strong tingle for the longest time...   We are very upset that this happened and we won't be coming back...   As for the server she apologized but you noticed after it all she wasn't being sincere and was being fake towards us since that happened!"}
{"text":"We had the worst service ever!!! The management needs to go back to their training. Horrible customer service! Food was cold, no napkins, no straws, no silverware! 45 min ticket times!!!! Wow, I can't believe how bad the service was and when I finally got a manager to come to the table he had an attitude! Spoke  to another manager and she said there's nothing she can do. This location needs to go back to train. They need to step up their service!!!! Will never go back here and I don't recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"One of the worst BWWs I've visited. When we entered, we were brought to a table without a peep or even a smile from the hostess. We also were not told \"thank you\" or \"have a nice night\" from said hostess when we left. Food came quickly and was as expected for BWW, even though I asked for tomatoes on my wrap and only got one lonely diced tomato piece (literally one square centimeter). I don't like being hassled to sign up for emails, and was given an attitude from the waiter when I declined. Not a single server there moved with any sort of speed/determination and not a single one smiled. Seems like poor management/hiring at this location and we will not be back."}
{"text":"Ate here twice while i was in Vegas. Sat at the bar both times. Chris was the bartender and he made sure the Warriors and Portland game was on for us. Wings came out hot and tasty. My cousin and i left a rally good tip to show our gratitude."}
{"text":"Great attentive service. Wings are big and juicy. Other food was just ok.   Overall a great place to come for wings and drinks.   They also offer beer mugs you can keep afterwards!"}
{"text":"The operations GM gave everyone who entered the craziest attitude because the place was packed for World Cup. I didn't appreciate it at all. I asked for a seat and she said they're not seating anymore. I then asked so if someone leaves what happens. She said then if you're on the list you get the next seat. I was confused. I asked her to add me at the next available table."}
{"text":"It deserves a negative star, no really it does.  I ordered the boneless teriyaki wings to go and OMG they tasted like salt.  It was my co-worker's bday and she loves this place so we all decided to order here for lunch, I figured safe to order teriyaki thinking you can't go wrong - light, sweet and salty.  All I got was salty, seriously my heart rate jumped immediately after one wing.  Hubby thinks it eat pretty salty already, but figured I would take them home for his take on it.  He agrees whomever made the sauce didn't taste it and just dumped too much salt/soy into the mix.  13 of the 16 pieces went to the trash, what a waste of money!  Save your money and your blood pressure go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We (party of 12) had an amazing time at the Super Bowl VIP party -- our server Nicole B was outstanding! The food and drinks at B-Dubs was and is always good -- so good we had to visit twice while on our last trip to Vegas. The management team (Mark and Rafael) at Miracle Mile Shops are super courteous! Cannot wait to go back during my next visit to Sin City! Mark D"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab some food or watch the games while eating.  Getting older has changed me more than I thought.  I'm. It a fan of loud noises and big crowds anymore."}
{"text":"A buddy and myself stopped in here for a beer a some food and were very satisfied with the food and service. We never had to wait for anything and the wings are awesome."}
{"text":"Not bad for wings, but I have had better! Wings Cafe in Sherman Oaks must try! They have great service as well."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. Their servers are not friendly. One was rolling her eyes while serving the table across from us, and I'm pretty sure our server forgot about us when she noticed us without food about 45 minutes after ordering. The food was also not worth it! The wings were cold and slimy. If you're looking for good wings go to Geno's."}
{"text":"I am a regular, the food never disappoints. However I was seated directly in front of the restrooms in a pretty unoccupied restaurant. This isn't the first time this has happened. So gross."}
{"text":"My food was really good (especially the Queso dip). The best part of my experience by far was my waiter by the name of Tom. He was a great- very polite, attentive, helpful, and friendly. It was the best customer service I've received in a long time. Because of that refreshing experience, I will definitely be back. Thanks, Tom!"}
{"text":"We B-dubs last night and it was semi busy but everytime we asked for something we seemed to be forgotten about, we didn't have a drink menu so I asked our server. 10 minutes passed and we still didn't get a menu so I got up and went to the hostess to get a menu.  We were a party of 7 and ordered all of our wings, all but two of us got our wings and had to wait almost 20 minutes. It wasn't until we asked another server if he knew where our waitress was did she show up and then went to check on the wings.  When our wings arrived the waitress noticed she hadn't brought carrots or celery for us. Another 15 minutes and she showed up with the veggies. Don't know if there wasn't enough staff but food was good."}
{"text":"i've had some pretty terrible service at some of the bww, but this one is amazing! the host, Jocelyn or something like that, was super nice. she offered my nephew a video game tablet that he enjoyed while waiting to be seated. our waitress was really friendly and patient (we were a rather big crowd). while we were waiting on our food to come, someone named Tara came and offered us to try different sauces. she was super friendly, and brought out things we'd like. It was just an all around great time, I will definitely be back soon. :)"}
{"text":"Just finished having lunch at this location. I ordered a salad with grilled chicken. It came out in about two minutes, meaning the chicken was premade. It was half cold and part of it was hard.  I asked for no carrots on the salad, but Lacy decided to bring it out and then ask me if that was OK instead of telling me before the food was made and presented. Additionally, I ordered a Diet Pepsi. After I took a couple sips, I could tell by the grittiness on my teeth that it was regular Pepsi. I asked my server if she was absolutely sure that this was diet. She asked me (half-smartassedly) if I would like her to bring me a another Diet Pepsi so that I can compare the taste of them. What I really wanted her to do was take her eyeballs off of the sports highlights she was watching and take two seconds out of her workday to check to see if the soda fountain lines had been switched. Thankfully, I am not a diabetic but I do watch my sugar intake very carefully for other health reasons. I was not checked up on during my meal at all, or I would've asked for water instead. This was probably one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in my life and I'm pretty angry at myself for giving them my money. I will never ever return to this location again.  Update: Called this location the day I went and asked to speak to a manager because I wanted to tell someone in charge that there was something wrong in their restaurant that could potentially make people sick (serving sugar to people who can't have sugar). I was told that they were all in a meeting and someone would call me back in about an hour and a half. Two days later, no phone call. I plan to go in tomorrow and make a complaint in person. I'm not trying to be petty, but it is extremely clear to me that the staff at this location does not care about customers and I just don't want anyone getting hurt or sick because they can't be bothered to make a phone call."}
{"text":"Good wings and gem the hot wings made my mouth water!! Plus when I went they were playing roller derby!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the hype is about this place. I have been here and other locations numerous times and it's always so so. The food all tastes the same and the service is never very good. I ordered a simple to go meal today and nothing came out right. It's just chicken tenders people. Plus everytime we have walked in we have been rudely greeted by snooty teenagers...will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Average at best.  Saw 4 people stand around (including assistant manager) while one person cleaned tables on a busy night while customers waited.  Food okay - Service okay."}
{"text":"Went to get some food togo and they completely messed my order up. Asked for traditional bone in and they gave me boneless asked for mango habenero they gave me hot boneless.  Gave me carrots and celery without asking if i wanted it and charged me for it, shorted me on blue cheese.  The bartender was eating the entire time i was there. Wanted a beer while i waited didn't ask me what size i wanted and just gave me a small so i ended up having two. Its dissapointing that the service was this terrible.  Wont ever go back to this location."}
{"text":"This place is filthy!  Our entire order was wrong.  Everyone's order was wrong.  Three of us did not receive our meals until the other were done eating.  It was a joke!  I will not be back!"}
{"text":"This location is ok....  The place is filthy.  Is this a trend with BWW?  Come on....pick up the crap off the floor!"}
{"text":"I am going outside the trend on this one. Everytime we are in town, we love to hang out here at midnight. The night crew is awesome. At times, we get the entire place for ourselves. The wings are pretty darn good. I like.mine plain with bbq sauce on the side. Happy hour starts at 10pm so street tacos are a must have. We love to spend time here talking and watching TV. Great ambiance with great music and excellent customer service. When everything in town is closed, this is our go to place."}
{"text":"Love it if u ever need any thing the captain is the one to ask they will take care of u ask jon or Jessica they happen us cracking up"}
{"text":"Katie thank you so much for your outstanding service, , probably one of the best server we ever had this week  so far took our order in time refill beverage without asking , front desk greet is with a very nice pleasant smile but one thing that  turned me off again is  carpet ,Booth and floor needs to be cleaned professionally I don't know what it is most place I've been they don't care about cleaning their floors maybe I have OCD.......I hope on my next visit the floor is not that sleeper and greasy  just hire a professional company once a month."}
{"text":"Love going to this buffalo wild wing on a Tuesday I always got good service. Kayland is the best"}
{"text":"My daughter purchased us medium hot wings,fries,and 2 drinks! Absolutely disgusting! The chicken was COLD and HARD as Hell! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON TAKE OUT! Because you will be taking it out just to dump it!! We're is health department when you need them!"}
{"text":"i would almost like to give this a 0 star why because tonight service was very bad ! I will explain how was my service tonight , came in brought some new people/friends for the first time to eat at bww & we get a table and our server JR  just comes and informs us after we order that , our ranch in our order is going to be $0.60 each after we had just been at buffalo wild wings last thursday and ranch was not $0.60 on our bill(it was free ) i ask to talk to the captain of bww he comes and explains how thursdays being a boneless  night deal they have to charge , but yet we never got charged for our ranch last thursday night.... so the captain Andrè who was very nice asks if we would like to talk to the manager & of course i request to speak to him at this point i am just upset the manager comes in sir Striker Williams , with a very bad attitute and very un-professional walks up to our table and just says yes today ranch is $0.60 basically came and just stated what i had already herd didn't even consider being pollite or even offering to wave the charge for this once (since we wern't aware of this) what he said to clean himself off that \"last time we came on a thursday and didn't get charge for our ranch was because the server was STEALING the companys money\" by not charging us last thursday thats what he came to say !!! very unprofessional makes me just want to spread the word , how much of a bad experience and bad service there is at this location!!! be aware this can happen to anybody and even on a worser day! bad location to go eat at sorry guys"}
{"text":"You know I use to go here all the time, its been a couple years and now that I've  moved back to vegas and started going here again I don't think there that great.. they don't put as much sauce as they used too and quality isn't worth the price. I would say overall \"OK\", but u might as well just go to applebees this is nothing special."}
{"text":"Bad service, cold food, and the big screens have marks all over them along with bad picture quality, the sound system keep cutting out during the fights and what kinda sports bar only has one urinal in the men's restroom!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. I'd like to give credit to the front of house employees working this afternoon, for their great attitudes and genuine helpfulness. By the way, the ghost pepper sauce is AMAZING on the shrimp bayou po'boy sandwich. Thanks, you guys. :)"}
{"text":"Got a to go order. Got 18 wings and sauce on the side with carrots. Was given one sauce and no dressing. I'm surprised I didn't have to ask for the bag to carry it out in or the container the solo sauce was placed in. Restaurant was dirty and there was nobody at the front when you walk in so you just have to flag somebody down who's trying their best to ignore you. Please address the bad smell, poor service and lack of common sense from the multiple employees who dropped the ball tonight. And every night considering the other reviews below."}
{"text":"2 and a half stars, try 1. Service is great as can be expected but the kitchen is way too slow. 45 minutes for 20 wings? That's ridiculous when all you do is wings? From what the server says that's just how it is because corporate is too cheap to replace a broken fryer. Pretty sad."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the to-go staff... Called in an order and when I went to pick up the items - 1/2 the order was no longer available or an item they sell. What? Why didn't they call me? Why didn't the person taking the order know this? The staff should have at least called me with an alternative item. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating and ordering at Buffalo wild wings , i ordered it online .when i got there the restaurant  looked like it was a slow day for them and still my food wasnt ready by the time i got there. After waiting for my food there also  Service was not good at all , im very dissapointed , the server just handed me the bag and did not even ask if i needed anything else .After that kind of service i just left  without  checking my order . When i got home i noticed my order of veggies was missing my dipping  sauce was missing , my salad looked disgusting , really old . Never going back there again."}
{"text":"Ask to be seated in the waitress Kim's section. She will make sure your experience is fast, fun and memorable! Also a very cool place to go watch sports and meet new ppl!"}
{"text":"Ha...... I'm here again! Seems like I'm visit here every Friday :)   I love ( lunch special ): 1. Traditional wings & fries: $7.49 2. Cheeseburger slammers & fries: $6.99 3. Buffalitos & salad: $5.99   but I always order:  1. Grilled chicken wrap: $7.99  --- cuz u can choose 'buffalo wild wings' sauce 2. 12 or 18 traditional wings with 'spicy garlic' sauce   Today! I'm going to try Chicken Carsar Wrap........ I love the one in BOMAS more :)  Also, what I want to mention is, I'm kind of picky and change my mind sometimes after order, but their services are good enough to treat me:) she still remember me 'hot water with honey and lemon' but they never provide honey :("}
{"text":"currently sitting down in this particular location, it's pretty dead, for a saturday night, there's about six servers, I can't seem to spot one at the moment, and ours happened to be m.i.a. the majority of our time here. when we first got here it took about 6 minutes before one of the many servers that passed or booth plenty of time to actually greet us and take our drink order, took a good 20 minutes before we received our extra ranch, whom we received from a nasty rude server and it's been more than 15 since she's comet to pick up the check and charge it. closet location to our home but I think I'd rather live without bww than come back to this crappy service again."}
{"text":"Always seem to have great servers. Today, Natalie was fast and friendly. It's nice to feel welcomed"}
{"text":"Partner orders a drink and server says he will give me a minute to look things over... a \"minute\" is 20m later another sever takes me order and still no drink. I flagged the original server and said I was ready to order a drink, he looked pretty confused so I let him know he said you were going to check back on me and never returned- to which he sharply retorted \"it's really busy.\" Not even an apology. Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Guess I'm just too \"busy\" to leave a tip then."}
{"text":"Came here to watch some baseball. We were asked if we wanted to sit on the patio and we said yes that's fine. After being outside, the table next to ours became the smoking table. We asked to go inside and we were immediately escorted inside and away from the smokers. Our waitress, Jessica was top notch. Came around just enough, our drinks were never empty and she was very pleasant. Love B-Dubs."}
{"text":"I went here with my parents for Father's Day, and while the food was good, the service was terrible. And we were one of the first ones in the dinner crowd (we got there around 4, so before any real dinner traffic was going to be there). I got the sweet BBQ and lemon pepper boneless wings. Both were standard. The lemon pepper were good because I was able to take them home with me and for lunch the next day. My parents both got flat, bone-in wings, extra crispy. I am not sure if it was because the wings were extra crispy, or what, but it took almost an hour for our food to come out. Which was ridiculous because we were basically the only ones in the restaurant. There were two girls who came in 30 min after us, and they were served their food before us. It will be awhile before I go back for anything other than a beer."}
{"text":"I love coming here it always nice and pack with nice ambiance good service the employees are nice the food is good and they have happy hour chip/ salsa or Queso I'm not sure if it $3.00 or $6.00 also have drinks too and Tuesday they have 65. wing's bone in Thursday's they have 65. bone less wing's hey why not go it they have special offers ."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, this was my first time.  The place is nice, the service kind of hit and miss and the food pretty average.   Good thing they have a vast selection of sauces so there are options as long as you like wings.  Nothing impressive but a fair place to have a quick bite.  Tuesday and Thursday they have wing specials.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"BW3 is not my go-to place, even for chain restaurant bar food.  Nothing was terrible, but nothing was particularly good either.  The atmosphere is nice.  They have a large multi-sided fireplace.  I appreciated the sealed bottles of milk that came with the kids' meals (because they never drink them anyway, and these I can easily take home for later) and also the mandarin oranges as a side.  The beer selection is not great."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get the best Buffalo Wild Wings. So i recommend 100x100  In any way please, visit and let us your oppinion yo get better information"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite places to go , but it seems though this establishment does not care about their customers and have no intent on keeping customers hence why they are closing down all over town. Charging .60 cents for dipping sauces, 3 people ordered large orders of wings and side dish but was told that we were only permitted 1 order of celery sticks (4) . Somehow spending almost 50$ is not enough of a profit for this business to provide celery or dipping sauce to customers.   Empty restaurant with 7 customers , 50 televisions on wasting electricity and wasteful expenses that can be spent on customers that are regulars with dining at this wing establishment. Wing stop has much better customer service and provide a warm and welcoming environment and food service for their patrons.   Employees at this location seem bothered by customers, do not offer any type of positive customer service but rather treat customers like they are a burden.   This business will shut down like other locations since the expenses in this establishment is spent on entertaining empty tables instead of providing food and good service .   Will tell everyone we know about how bad this place is :)"}
{"text":"BWW is a popular spot for those that are into the whole sports thing, but that's just not me. I always forget when you go later in the evening during any sort of game you'll have about 30 beer bellied guys shouting at the top of their lunges at a flatscreen in a dark restaurant. The waits are usually longer than my appetite would like but it's not unbearable.   While I'm not a fan of the atmosphere, I always enjoy my wings. They have a variety of flavors that you can choose from and even taste the sauces before you officially make your decision. Whether you get boneless or bone-in, they're always nice and crispy and perfect to my liking. My favorites are always the parmesan garlic, spicy garlic, lemon pepper, and thai curry. Wings come with a side of carrots and/or celery sticks, yum!  Best part about BWW: Tuesdays are 60c bone-in wings, Thursdays are 60c boneless wings. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Came to watch the Giants-Steelers game. First thing I noticed after being sat was how filthy the floor is, trash and good crumbs everywhere. Our meal was brought out and our server, Acai, hadn't even brought us napkins, silverware, or anything yet. Food was decent.  There were 4 of us eating, and we would have to stop our server to ask for refills constantly. Talked to a manager, an older guy, possibly the GM? I'm not sure. But every time we would have to track our server down she wouldn't even stop at the table to see what we needed, she would talk to us as she kept walking to go somewhere else, and handed us sauces and other things over the back of the seats and over the wall beside our table. Completely rude and completely unprofessional. Needless to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"All I heard about this place from friend back in the midwest was about how cool this place was...  well...  wait for it....  wait for it...    FAAAAAILURE!  Went here with hockey buddies after a game and we wait for 30 minutes in a packed, small waiting area.  When we looked into the restaurant, there were tons of empty tables... I'm talking like 10 to 20 tables.   meanwhile my stomach is empty as hell and screamin' for some food.  We waited and waited and finally got in after about a 30 minute wait....  While we were seated, I watched the other less fortunate souls waiting with puppy dog eyes at the front waiting area, as they stared in amazement at the 20 or so empty tables and no servers seating anyone.  It was so blatant and wrong yo!  It was like waving a pork chop in the front of an Ethiopian kid.  Exactly!  Soooo wrong.    So finally the food comes out after a super long time.  When my burger comes out, it looks like a puck that I just slapshotted in my hockey game!  It's totally freakin' hard as a rock and the fries are old and have been sitting around.  Oh hells no.  The crazy thing is that I'm so hungry I wolf this thing down in about 5 seconds.  Don't lie, you know you have done the same thing...  lol    This place was a total failure.  I doubt this one location is indicative of the entire chain... but be warned, the servers, waiters and managers do not give a shit about you, the food or anything else in between.  Where the hell is the zero stars option...    Keepin' it realz...."}
{"text":"Reason why I go to this place is because I love their chicken wings with mild buffalo sauce!! Delicious! Best wings ever!"}
{"text":"My friends were having their Fantasy Football Draft Party here and I tagged along(I love chicken wings). They reserved eight booths for our party and there was more than enough room. Our server was always checking on us, the service was better than usual. I had the small size order of the Spicy Garlic Chicken Wings. The order came with about ten wings, but I forgot how huge their wings are. The order was $11. I thought the spicy garlic sauce was okay, but I think I prefer the plain wings. Until next year BWW."}
{"text":"This BWW location is a solid 4-star-er.  Pros: -Wings and tons of sauces (my faves: honey BBQ, asian zing) -Offer low-fat ranch, regular ranch and bleu cheese for wing dips -Good happy hour food and drink specials -Tuesdays - regular wing specials -Thursdays - boneless wing specials -Service - I've ALWAYS had very accommodating servers and bartenders, including changing TV channel to a different game -Calorie counts on menus - make better informed decisions  Cons: -Noise level - it's CRAZY loud in here, even when there are no major games on -Misters do a better job of cooling down the area OUTSIDE of the patio than they do cooling the actual patio area. -Dry seasoning (in lieu of sauces) - avoid -Calorie counts on menus - you'll quickly realize you're about to consume 1k calories, minimum  They've also recently added a new position that is sort of a 'good time coordinator' if you will.  She will offer little beer tasters (though I found out that I cannot sip, but rather have to slam down any liquid given to me in a shot glass...oops.).  She also coordinates promo events and the wing challenge.  A few weeks ago, they had a competition where you could guess the USA Olympic medal counts to win up to 50 free wings...  And I won!  50 FREE WINGS!  Obviously I'll be back for my freebies and others.  Dietary tip: Get the naked tenders with your favorite wing sauce and sub a side salad for the fries to make a very filling meal for at least half the calories of everything else on the menu.  Thanks to my pal Paulie D. for that one!"}
{"text":"Food is to die for. If it wasn't, I wouldn't go, the service is terrible. I am a server and I tip well and this is the only place I have ever stiffed. I understand it's a busy place but Workers are also in the corner talking it up."}
{"text":"We have been regulars here for years simply because we like the food and it's the only location near by, however we know every time we will be waiting and we will have extremely bad service. It never fails. I think the only person that pays any attention is the sauce girl they call the 'captian', she's pretty awesome. Do yourself a favor, take your food to go. You won't have to waste your money on tipping someone who probably doesn't deserve it."}
{"text":"This was one the worst meals we've ever had. We ordered from the Lunch Fastbreak menu. We ordered the cheese burgers they were over cooked and the meat and bun were tough, the wedge fries were cold and the bone in wings that we order mild were cold like they had been setting around until someone orders them then they pour sauce on them and give them to you.  I was very disappointed my husband had gone to one on Frank loyd Wright and said it was delicious."}
{"text":"This was absolutely the worst service I've ever had. The servers name was \"Reshenda\" and it was the most lazy service I've ever had. She had absolutely no care for anything that was going on. I told them my drink tasted bad and 8 minutes later she came back to me after walking past me multiple times and tells me that the soda I asked for was out, then the last 20 minutes of my meal My table and I didn't have a glass of water at all, she didn't even come to check on us while we were eating to see if we needed more water, and the restaurant wasn't even busy!!! completely did not care about her customers. And then to top it all off our bill was $36.50 and we gave her $37.00 and she never came back with the change and our receipt she kept it as if she earned it and we did not say she could have it. What kind of server has the audacity to keep the change and receipt without it being given to them!!! It was the most mind boggling thing I've ever seen done from a server, And then when we asked another server named Megan for the manager she looked at me as if I was stupid for asking. WORST service I've ever had at any place of business EVER! I will never be back to this location ever again, if I could rate 0 I would."}
{"text":"Been here several times now with the bf and we both love this place! As soon as we walk in, we are greeted and immediately seated. We usually sit in the bar area at one of the high tops since the boyfriend loves football and can watch the game AND act like he's paying attention to me lol  We order drinks and place our orders within 5-10 minutes of sitting down. Never had a bad meal or experience here :)"}
{"text":"The food is even worse than the service (which is terrible).  The BBQ sandwich was so salty it was utterly inedible.  The clueless waiter stood there dumbfounded as I told him I was not paying for it.  I do not see how this place stays in business with service, and food this bad."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings open 24/7 yes please! So good! Went two nights in a row. The first night my husband had them and I had something else. I tried one of his and ended up mad at myself that I didn't get it also. Lesson learned. The next night after riding the High Roller and walking the strip really late at night, we didn't know what we wanted for dinner. Hubby remembered they don't close so we decided on going there. Staying at the Vdara, it's not that long of a walk for us to walk there, get our food and bring it back to the room. It was $ 0.50 wing Tuesday so even better. Service didn't take long and the wings were cooked very well. Definitely going back next trip."}
{"text":"As my wife and I attempted to eat dinner we waited 15 minutes to even be acknowledged. I noted the young overly tattooed man who I am assuming was our waiter was very busy engaged in horseplay with many other employees by the main entrance.  Once we were acknowledged by dropping off menus to our table and saying I will be back, he left to continue his conversation at the main entrance of the restaurant.  As we walked by him to leave all he did was laugh. I truly think management should be held accountable at this restaurant for their lack of oversight. I will never return to a place that doesn't value my business."}
{"text":"Went here because they were listed on the ufc website as a place to watch the fight on October 1st. Oh they put it on. It was on the smallest TV in the corner of the bar and no others in the bar. This is a poor representation for the ufc. I let the two bartenders know they were an advertised bar and they didn't care. We didn't bother finishing our drinks and left. Just around the corner PTs had the fight playing where you could actually watch it. Don't bother going here for a ufc fight."}
{"text":"For a place that supposedly specializes in wings they are terrible, especially with all the wing places to choose from I can't see them succeeding for too long   We had onion rings and fries to start, the onion rings am were very good as well as the fries   The place was nice, clean and the service was good   If you are like myself and enjoy wings you will not like these ones"}
{"text":"This is hands down the WORST BWW in union and mecklenburg county, and I've been to several. I have had several bad experiences including waiting for hours for food, completely screwed up to go orders, no service at all - that's right I have sat in this restraunt for over 30 min to not have one person come to my table, all while management is standing around playing on their phones and talking. To top it off, the only thing they will give you are \"coupons\" as compensation for terrible service and food. I even asked for a refund, was told it would take a week to go through only to have never gotten my money back. The employees and management here (not all but 99%) are completely incompetent. I will NEVER visit this BWW again. If there was a rating for less than 1 star that's what would be here, hell I wouldn't give them an eighth of star..."}
{"text":"There comes a time in every girl's life where she has to endure a B-Dubs. I admit, this was my second time at one of these, not the first, and I ALSO admit that I was the one who suggested we go there. Shocking, I know. But:  a) one of my companions was, as she put it, \"on a severe budget,\" b) we wanted someplace for just appetizers and drinks, and  c) it is close to where we both work.   For what it is, it really isn't that bad. Fairly tasty, not-too-dry chicken with whatever sauce you want (ranging from amateur-level, like the mild I had, to those wishing to inflict pain on themselves with ridiculously hot sauces. I had the boneless wings, which were more like glorified McNuggets, yet I ate every damn one in my basket. You can choose from just a few, to much too many, wings (making it perfect for every budget). Also supporting the \"we're poor\" faction was their list of daily specials, ranging from $2.00 drafts to (I can't remember the exact amount)-cent wings.   They had Man vs. Food on, and as I watched that Adam guy eat his weight in fried cheese, I thought about how brilliant it was that we were at a chicken wing place and feeling good about the way we were eating. Coincidence? I think not!"}
{"text":"I want to like this restaurant. I've eaten in them  from here to Florida and I really want to say it's my favorite wing place. But I've got to be honest here.  I have never - NEVER - picked up my order and gotten everything we've asked for in the take out bag. Not once. Not here, not at any other one either. I don't get it. Our order is fairly simple.  wings - glazed in teriyaki or asian zing, depending wings - plain, sometimes with a sauce on the side onion ring basket celery  blue cheese  5 things. 5. Maybe 6 if there's a cup of sauce added.  Not one time in all these years has it been right. When I go in, I take every single little thing out of the bag and lay it on the counter to double check, then wait while they probably spit in whatever I'm standing there waiting for. I hope not, but they're kids running the place in each spot, so who knows what they're doing? (Ever seen the moving \"Waiting\"? Yeah, I worked in restaurants. It's just like that. Don't piss off your servers!) My husband gets so flustered with going in that he just pays and leaves, never checking. So when he gets home, I'm pulling stuff out of the fridge to make up for whatever didn't make it down the road (but what we got charged for anyway).   On the whole, the wings are decent. I like them crunchy and a bit overdone. I hate slimy wings, so no complaints there. Never tried the boneless ones, but our adult son seems to enjoy them because that's what he gets.   The celery, when we get it, has always been fresh and well cleaned.   My only complaint with the food is the sides, and that could be because we drive it home. The onion rings are extremely greasy and within minutes of leaving the restaurant, are limp and falling apart in most cases. I've had the wedges with cheese and by the time we got home, the wedges were cold and the cheese was cement-like. I wish they'd use the canned semi-liquid cheese. That would work out so much better than the cheap stuff they throw on there then bake in to a hard crust.   So like I said, I want to like this place...especially since sometimes I just don't feel like butchering my own wings. But for now...eh. It'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"I love coming to this b-dubs!!   Has cold beer and yummy wraps. Honey bbq is my favorite flavor. The wait staff is pretty nice. Don't like going to much during lunch to sit at the bar anymore tho, the waitress is super nice and very slow!! I think we waited about 10 minutes to get our check one day.. But other then that service is usually pretty good"}
{"text":"I work graveyard and this place being 24 hours is one of my top picks. Always good food, never had any issues here, and always good service at night."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch. First time.  Nikki and Tayelor were so welcoming and nice! They know their jobs and are obviously proud to work here. Refreshing to see. They came around and explained the sauces and how they do things and gave me a taste test for wing sauces. The beer selection had my favorite San Tan Brewery beers and more massive selection too. The side salad with the lunch special was fantastic! No wilted iceberg here. The wings were killer and I had to take home as I could not eat them all. Next tjme extra crispy will work even better. TVS are everywhere. Coming back for a game. Super sports bar with class. Rare in Mesa. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wings were good.. Which is why I gave it 2 stars. Service at his location seems to get worse everytime I stop by. The bartender gets our drink order wrong than comes by to get our food order and realizes halfway she needs to jot it down. Then of course we ask for 1 more ranch and it seems like I ordered a bunch of wings since it takes 15 minutes to get it. Speaking of wings taking a long time.. We ordered a snack size to go before we were done eating and that also took quite a while. Not sure if they were plucking the feathers off the chicken but when we reminded the bartender she seemed like she forgot as well. When she came back with our order there was no\" hey sorry for the wait but thanks for coming\". When we thanked her for the wings all we got was a YUP. Between parking and service it can be a hassle Coming to this location."}
{"text":"I love buffalo wild wings but I had to point out few things. We order foods every other week or at least once a month and  they are keep forgetting my orders. Once they forgot my sauce for my onion rings, next time they forgot my celeries. Yesterday they forgot my celeries & carrots and my bottle of sauce that I paid $5.79 extra. Couple months ago we realized that we were missing onion rings when we got home so we got credit for that. We will be back since this location is in our area but please stop forgetting my orders.   Customers, make sure you check your orders before you leave!"}
{"text":"Over-priced food, always quite loud and crowded, and always filled with scantily clad college floozies.   The nickname \"B-Dubs\" Is the most annoying thing ever, too. I hate that nickname.  DISCLAIMER: I don't really enjoy loud and crowded restaurants or sports bars in general, so I'm totally and utterly biased. If you're like me at all, you won't enjoy it.  If you are NOT like me, you will probably enjoy it as much as my friends seem to.  If you love meat, alcohol, sports and the possibility of seeing lots of college floozies, you will absolutely LOVE it. I'm serious. You really will. I hope you have fun!  -I'm on a super tight budget, so the wings are too pricey for me. BUT, they do have a huge variety of flavors, so if you can afford it and like wings, I definitely recommend trying them. You WILL find a flavor you like.  -For 6 or 7 dollars, you only get a couple of mozzarella sticks, which is disappointing, and although they are not the best, they are good. -At 2 or 3 dollars, the cheapest thing on the menu is the veggie tray, which has a generous amount of freshly cut carrot sticks and celery, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  There are hundreds of huge TVs so scanning the room, you're bound to find something to watch. I actually had a passable time there when the Olympics were on.  The waitresses have always been friendly and helpful.   I am a quiet, college age person with no interest in sports or loud, crowded restaurants and I would never, ever, ever, ever come here on my own volition.   BUT... my friends seem to like that sort of thing and if you do, too, you'll probably like Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Love the Tuesday deal that you could get good amount of different wings for a good price. Teriyaki flavor is my favorite."}
{"text":"Great hangout spot for ASU students, especially for a big game or a UFC card.  Service is hit and miss. Some days you'll get a cute waitress who makes sure you're always comfortable, and then there are days where you get a waitress who takes long on your food, yet tries to close your tab quickly even while you're in the middle of watching a game. Wish it could be consistent."}
{"text":"I had a good experience at this location. The bartender was our waitress and she checked on us so many times I never felt like I was waiting for anything. Our food came out correctly and in a timely fashion. We were also checked on by other wait staff to make sure we didn't need anything when the bartender got busy.   *All drafts are a $1 off during HH"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been to a Buffalo Wild Wings, and a few things have changed. It still has good bar food in a sports-bar setting, but the place seemed overrun with kids -- at least on this late Saturday afternoon.  My husband and I stopped in with two friends for a late lunch/early dinner. The spouse and I each had a Stone IPA, and we split the Tablegating Sampler, which was more than enough food for two: wings, soft pretzels and queso, pita chips with spinach-artichoke dip, and bacon-cheddar jalapeno bites. Our friends come here more often, and they stuck with their usual orders: grilled chicken buffalitos for her and a burger for him.  The food was pretty good, and the service was excellent. Our waitress was also responsible for a large table of children, and she was very attentive to us and patient with the kids. Prices were reasonable, and we were in and out in under an hour.  Due to the huge underage clientele, this \"B-Dubs\" seemed more like an upscale Chuck E. Cheese's than Caesars Palace Sports Book. But if you're a single dad wanting a night out with your daughter or the sole chaperone to a group of rowdy 8-year-olds (both of whom were our dining partners this day), it's a perfect place to get your drink on in a safe, family atmosphere."}
{"text":"I should have read the prior reviews and headed the warnings.  Alas, I did not.  While everyone involved in my take-out order was friendly, the horrible quality of the dry, cold, wings was absolutely pitiful. While there was plenty of sauce, it looked like they just dumped a bucket of sauce over the old decrepit bird parts.  For what it's worth, I used to go to another location of BWW in Pittsburgh all the time, and the food quality was much better.  There's simply something wrong with this location? Kitchen staff?  Avoid. Yuck.  Of course the main problem here is that one bad location gives the whole chain a bad reputation.  BWW Corporate should investigate this location."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible. On a night when there was hardly anybody in the restaurant they could not cook a small order of boneless wings in less than 40 minutes. I told the waitress after 30 minutes if I do not have my order in 10 minutes I was going to leave. They could not produce. What a shame.r"}
{"text":"Ohhh boy!! This place is a mess in every way!!! This is probably my 5th time at this location (only because it is close to home) and it just keeps getting progressively worse!  First of all the hostess stand is a cluster of college drop outs standing around looking like a bunch of deer in headlights. Once u get your seat assignment you better hope you get a server that actually gives a crap.  We were lucky this time to have one that could give two shits about what was going on. It was like an episode of punk'd except i didn't end up seeing Ashton Kutcher at the end.  Anyway you guys need alot of help and for the love of god the management just needs to start fresh!!!"}
{"text":"I detest this location and only go since my husband insists on wings.  We have been here multiple times and this visit made me write a review.  Horrible service.  Our son's burger was burnt, charcoal burnt, on the bottom and they tried to hide it.  His macaroni noodles were not cooked and came in a soupy sauce that looked like the cheese was curdled.  Our son took a couple of bites and wouldn't touch the rest after proclaiming \"yuck\".  Buffalo chips and cheese were overcooked and no sign of cheese on them.  Hardly any sauce on the wings and they seemed to be reheated.  Took about 45 minutes to get our food so we didn't want to wait any longer.  Celery not delivered until after multiple requests made and dinner almost over.  Waitress seemed irritated to be there.  Doubtful that we will come back to this location."}
{"text":"Wings are amazing, this used to be my favorite BWW but lately the service is horrible this time it took them 40 minutes before they gave us the menus and another 10 minutes to take our order the servers need to pay more attention"}
{"text":"I came here today after placing a take out order. When I made the order I was told my order would be ready 10-15 minutes later. I arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes later and paid for my order AFTER I paid I was told it would be a wait because the were backed up on bone less wings.  I was in a hurry (which is why I placed a take out order!) so I told the young lady who was helping me that if the order would take a lot longer I would need to get a refund because I was in a big rush I had an appointment with a wedding planner.   She went to check on the wings and didn't come back until my order was ready and she had it in her hand it took and additional 15 minutes but there was no one around to cancel the order with so I waited. When I revived the order the young lady just handed it to me. She didn't check it with me so I checked it in the car it was complete however the entire bag was sticky and gross with sauce every where all the boxes had sauce on them! Worst experience I have had at a Buffalo Wild Wings.   Besides my experience the restroom was gross. There were at least 20-30 people waiting to be seated which were all told 10-15 minutes to be seated(there was no way that was happening) along with other people frustratingly waiting for their own take out orders. It was just irritating to deal with the staff here they act like they don't see you sometimes and walk away or they hide in the kitchen."}
{"text":"The food here is good, my boyfriend and I go to BWW often for the wing specials or happy hour which are both a good deal. There are just two complaints I have about this particular location; (most) of the staff is SO rude and don't really have a concept of getting their job accomplished (the waitresses mostly) but also the girls who take orders at the front. My boyfriend and I have literally waited to be acknowledged for several minutes while three girl just stood LITERALLY 2 feet away talking and laughing we even said \"excuse me\" and they finished their conversations and then one of them came over. And when ordering take out you are told your food will be ready in 15-20 minutes, you arrive and the food is not ready ok, no big deal so you wait and when the food is ready it is ALWAYS 100% of the time wrong, and it's always different temperatures its like they make 1 thing first and let it sit and then make something else so by the time you pick up your food half of it is cold and half is blazing hot! Anyway I still go here cuz the food is good but they suck at their actual jobs."}
{"text":"After a year off from the last bad experience here we are again with overpriced, small portioned, crappy, freezer burned food.  The staff is nice but it doesn't make up for every other bad thing about this place. With the loud music and the people talking the noise just echo's like we are in a cave.   Still can't get it right BWW...  See ya again in a year or two."}
{"text":"Had late dinner around 9pm 1/21. Sat by the bar tables. Order appetizer which didn't arrived till after my main meal. I refuse the appetizer and server rolled her eyes and walked away. Not very caring."}
{"text":"Literally nothing good to say about our first or second visit! First time was busy so I get the service is not its best. 2nd time waiting for an hour for our food when there is one other family here is totally ridiculous. WORST restaurant ever!!!!"}
{"text":"They mailed us a $25 gift card to make up for the incident last time. At least they're willing to admit their mistake and atone."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for wings and beer, and you're hanging out or staying in the Uptown Charlotte area, then this is the place to go.  They have tons of different sauce/flavor options for the wings, a good selection of appetizers, and lots of different beers to choose from."}
{"text":"We  always have a great time every time we are here! Specially when we get our regular waiter! I have to say he is the best, he is all about costumer service!"}
{"text":"This place, and the one on Elliot near Cooper Rd got me thinking BWW has my favorite wings. I know I like to spread the love on local businesses and this isn't really one, but it's locally owned. I see the owner all the time in the restaurants, or at Gilbert parade and events so I feel like I'm still supporting a local business.   I also did the Blazin' Challenge here Jan 2012. I finished it in 5:57. With 3 seconds left to go! So look for my picture gracing the wall for the rest of 2012. The real challenge with that is being able to eat 12 wings in 6 minutes. That is tough enough by itself. I do have to say Teakwoods has hotter wings than here but this is enough to put me in sooo much pain.   When I'm not trying to kill myself with blazin wings, I love watching games/fights here. There is a bazillion TV's everywhere. They usually have great drink specials when I'm there and of course I'm tearing up some wings since they are amazing!   Even compared to other BBW in the valley, I feel like the owner makes her staff go above and beyond and I get a better experience here than any other BBW outside of Gilbert.   Protip: If you live in the area, sign up for their text updates and I get messages from them letting me know when they have \"extra special\" specials."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the hostess was very friendly and welcoming. We asked for the wings extra crispy and when they came out they weren't as crispy we had hoped. so the manager came over and suggested we ask for them extra crispy and grilled... so we did and they were amazing! Completely enhanced the flavor :)  Everyone there was extremely friendly, welcoming and definitely made our experience wonderful. Food was also delicious... can't wait to go back! :) Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 12:30 on a Saturday (they close at 1). We politely asked if the kitchen was open for a to go order and the bar tender said quickly shut that down  Too bad I worked at a bww for years at multiple locations. Each one advertised that the kitchen was open till close.   Try no to lie to customers- you never know which ones will know :)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible the management was super rude wait staff is incompetent and understaffed for getting in fights in the middle of the restaurant A cook Comes barging out of the kitchen slamming the door open and slinging his apron off in front of hundreds of children. Over 20 open tables and a way of one hour the posters I have zero training this place is a complete messThis place is a disaster and every year it gets worse if this corporation doesn't do something about this location they're going to have big problems on their hands"}
{"text":"Good service but food is weak. Good that there are a lot of Tvs with games. Boneless Thursday's wasn't worth it. Overdone, flavorless hot nuggets. Couldn't finish. If you're called BWW your wings should be right on all the time. Eh another chain that spends a lot on ads but should spend more on food production"}
{"text":"Just like the other locations in the Cleveland area, BW3 serves solid wings and other bar food staples in a laid back atmosphere with lots of tv's playing sports.  The beer list is pretty boring, offering all the standard American brews and basic liquors- nothing too exciting here.  They're not trying to reinvent the wheel here.  They do get props for the handheld game tablets that the kids love and keeps them occupied until the food arrives.  I don't go here too often, but I have to say our server today was excellent.  She was affable, engaging, and had a smile on her face- which is what all servers are supposed to be like, except 90% of them have no business serving the public, because they do not know how to deal with people- I just don't understand why those with no people skills work as servers?  Most of them are terrible, from the guy taking orders at McDonald's to the hipster server at some overpriced, overrated bistro in some trendy part of town.  Rule #1, if you can't stand people and wouldn't know a smile if it hit you in the head, do not get a job in customer service, go sit in a cubicle away from the rest of the world...thanks!"}
{"text":"This place used to be our family favorite but has now become more frustrating then it's worth...NEVER get a seat on the weekends w/o a minimum 45 minute wait. Waitresses are great, but the hostesses need training desperately!! We love bww food but unless you go before 4:00 you will be waiting and waiting for a seat."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a BWW in forever because it never seemed to be a good experience no matter where the BWW was located. This was one of the best experiences I've ever had at a BWW. Our server was attentive, professional and friendly. The food was fast and as ordered. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Service is always great no matter the location. Happy Hour large beer glasses. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with the staff aswell as the food. This location is great for watching UFC or any sports."}
{"text":"was here with my two best friends watching my San Diego Chargers that's just perfect for me.. by the end of our dinner we where taking pics and the busser did a good job on getting in it that made our time...cold beers great food and everything was perfect.....thanks Buffalo wild wings ."}
{"text":"Remember on the sitcom Cheers how \"...everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came...\" - well, that's how I feel when I go to this particular Buffalo Wild Wings. I'm always treated like a visiting friend who everyone is happy to see. And though I have a special order (wings cooked 8 extra minutes) it's right every time.  I take editing/critique work up there and spend an hour or so at it (gets me out of the office once in a while). MJ always keeps my glass full and the wings crispy. I get a lot done and am treated to terrific conversation. I can't say enough about this place or the people there.  If you love wings, this Buffalo Wild Wings is a must. And have them add 8 extra minutes. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Bro WTF the waitress spilled my wifes drink on the table and doesn't notice. comes back 15 minutes later and asks what will u do, asking for our order. put our order in and then the one waiter we hope to get has to bring us our appetizer. and still no rag to clean up the soda the waitress spilled after we asked for one.  She  forgot to bring a rag and ended up putting all our napkins  on the spill, and made it seem  like such a problem for her to get more napkins. Would speak to the floor manager but she was on her cell not working. our waitress name tag said Cass. the only employee actually working on the floor was a man named Terry, whom we wish we would get as a server more often. Hope this helps everyone. Also hope someone in the management reads this and gets a clue."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever waited an hr to be seated and waited 2 hours for our orders to be made and to receive food that wasn't made correctly after 2 damn hours. And then be told that we would have to wait longer if they were to fix it so after 3 hours of waiting did not end up eating!"}
{"text":"Me and my best friend went here for a late evening craving. We ordered off their happy hour menu for drinks. I loved my margarita. One of the best I have had in a while! I was not expecting it to taste so good.  We ordered from half off traditional wings menu. We ordered hot and bbq. They were great. We also got some of their queso dip appetizer.  Our server was VERY attentive and kind. He helped us out with the menu and convinced us to get some dessert. We ordered the cheesecake bites and they were amazing!! I wish i could remember his name, but next time I visit, I will be sure to ask!  Please make your way to B-dubs if you are ever on this side of town in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great service at this location. Servers are fast, bartenders are friendly, and the captains do an excellent job of setting TVs and celebrating birthdays."}
{"text":"Definitely prefer this location over the one on prospect ave. The waiters and waitresses are always friendly. My boyfriend and I have come here so much we've befriended a waiter and he knows our order by heart.  The layout is spacious and when it's nice they have an outdoor patio. You can also get an app that allows you to pick the music while you're there."}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wild Wings just not this location. The service sucks our bartender sucked she moved at about the same pace as a turtle and the turtle is probably faster. It was slow so totally unacceptable for it to take 15 minutes to greet us. Our food was good so that's the only reason they get 2 stars. I've been to many Buffalo Wild Wings locations but this one is one I will probably not go back to. And we wanted to watch a game and they wouldn't change the the until all the games ended which were already \"pre-programmed\" but 15 minutes later they change it because they guys next to us requested a game which was turned right away. They then turned our game on only because I turned over and said seriously? Will NOT be back! And the bartender could've gotten a better tip from us!"}
{"text":"Took my little sister here for lunch for her 21st birthday and the service was awesome! Our Guest Experience Captain, Felica, was outstanding! She was definitely on her game when she greeted us. We asked her about the wings. She was quick to offer and suggest the different types of wing sauces. The way she described each sauce assured me that she definitely knew what she was talking about. She let us sample several sauces, 3 of which we actually chose. Felica also offered my sister samples of beer, 3 of which she never tried before and 3 of which she now loves. The experience and service here was unbelievable thanks in large part to Felica's knowledge of the menu/drinks, her down-to-earth personality, and her spectacular willingness to help out her guests. I'll definitely be referring friends to this location and I'll definitely be coming back very soon. Thanks for the outstanding service Felica!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  This was my first time at any BWW and i am not sure i will ever go back.  Particularly not to this location.  Service was terrible and my fries and wings came out on the not so warm side.  It was like our food had been sitting in the back waiting for it to be picked up by the server.  Which seems plausible since it took 20 minutes for a waitress to take our order after we had waited nearly an hour to be seated.  Once she took our order it took another 20-30 minutes before our food came out.  There were other tables around us that seemed to get their food and better service and they were seated after we were.  It was a lousy 2 hour experience that i would not like to repeat ever again.   Save yourself the trouble and don't come here. Like another reviewer stated, go to wing stop. You will get better service and food somewhere else."}
{"text":"Yukkkkkkk. Everything tastes frozen, wings were disgusting...go to Hooters or The Hub for wings. Service was amazing-I will give them that. But I wouldn't come close to another Buffalo wild wings for the rest of my life. EVER"}
{"text":"Delicious wings.  You can try different sauces (orders of 5 can have a diff flavor). Also tried the coleslaw which was ok too.  I would def be back"}
{"text":"The staff has no sense of common sense or customer service. Right when I walked in the hostess was texting, and completely ignored me. I waited about a minute for her to acknowledge my existence, then she asked my how many were in my party. She said the wait was going to be 10-15 minutes. Fine.  THEN, 10 minutes later (while I was still waiting), another party walked in and the hostess told them that they could go right in. I stood up and told her that I had been waiting, then she signaled me to go in and find my own table. After finding one, u had to hunt down an employee to clean my table. I regret coming here, I should've just gone to chandler.   The only people that treated us well were Alli and Chad. They were both sweet, and patient."}
{"text":"Hard to win with par service and subpar food. More importantly if you know your customers are going to have messy hands, you better make sure the outside of the glass is clean. This place once was a really good place to hang with friends after work. I even would bring the family. It's Thursday night \"Wing Night\" and the place is dead; it once required a wait. They have upgraded the interior which is nice, but you want your customers back you need to make sure operations are flawless and elevate your customer service game. The only reason I didn't go local like \"Caps Sports Grill\" is due to the video games you offer kids."}
{"text":"By far the worst BWW I have ever been too!! The appetizers were brought out with our entrees so they were cold ! How did that even happen ? The waiter I get it's late but he  didn't do that great tending to our table. Very bad experience"}
{"text":"We love wild wings... we go to wild wings at least once every two months. After our last issue here, we decided we would go to other locations. We forgot why we stopped going to this location until we were greeted.  So we are really easy when we order. We get the same thing every time. We order our drinks, tell our waiter, Mark, we can order our food and we do. We order medium boneless wings and start listing four sauces..... Lately there has been a little bit of confusion for which sizes get how many sauces. Most locations give 4 sauces with a medium boneless wings.  Mark stated that we can only have 3 sauces for a medium. I mentioned that that was odd because other locations do 4. He stated that since the other locations are franchises, they don't follow the same rules... and then they weigh the chicken, depending on the weight and amount of wings in each pound, they decide on the number of sauces.... this seemed a bit unbelievable... Regardless, we were forced to size up. And we asked for them to be wet. When we got our order , we which we did get pretty promptly (only positive note) two of our groups of wings barely had any sauce on them. Needless to say, we remember why we stopped going to this location, and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Franki has opened my eyes to new flavors, seasonings, and dry rubs that I can simply do at home! So grateful and keep up the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to give this particular Buffalo Wild Wings another try. We ordered takeout instead, so I thought, \"how can you mess that up?\" Well, you can. We ordered honey BBQ, mango habanero, and medium boneless wings with some onion rings on the side. The onion rings were packed into the smallest to go box when usually you get a ton if you dine in and at the other locations, they give you the big to-go box with onion rings(or whatever side you order). The wings that were supposed to be medium flavored were plain.. there was absolutely no sauce on them. The wings that were mango habanero were so lightly sauced up, it didn't have any heat to it. I'm pretty disappointed that they even messed this up. I love Buffalo Wild Wings, but this location hasn't impressed us."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and the food is so good! The waitress I had was awesome too. The hosts are equally sweet and doctheir job well"}
{"text":"Poor customer service on behalf of the manager, Dave. When we got home, we found our to go order to be wrong. I called, and Dave said he'd send us a gift card. Two weeks went by, but no gift card arrived. I called again and left a message. Jay or Jake, an employee, said Dave would be in shortly. He never returned that call. I have left a Facebook review and now filed a complaint with the BBB. This may be excessive, but his treatment of a customer who comes there several times a month is far worse."}
{"text":"We had a party of 8 and had to wait almost a hour. Our patiences was pretty short but we continued to wait . Trey was our greeter at the front. He was very kind, understanding of our frustrations, and kept us updated on our estimated wait time. He sure knows how to deal with irritated customers. I requested to talk to the manager to tell them how awesome he was. Our waiter was Manny, he two provided us with outstanding service. Kudos to them both for doing a great job. Food was good and hot. Wings were a little dry but I just requested extra sauce on the side."}
{"text":"We came here with some friends to watch the Minnesota Timberwolves play the Golden State Warriors on the big screen at the bar, and the bartenders took great care of us.  We had some beers, a Southwest Blackened Chicken Salad, a Grilled Buffalo Bleu Chicken Sandwich & Fries, 10 Garlic Parmesan Boneless Wings, and 10 Spicy Garlic Boneless Wings.  Overall, we had a great time and enjoyed the food and beers.  If you are looking for a great sports bar in Phoenix, go here."}
{"text":"Weeeeeeeeak !  Bad food ! (i.e., my Mac & Cheese was water) I was also trying to figure out why my chicken wings bones were cold but the meat was warm. Almost as if it was microwaved. Where they do that at? Also the chicken wings were as big as drumsticks, I don't like that shit. Not to mention the music was from an employee phone and she kept getting text so the music would stop randomly !   However, the water was great"}
{"text":"My best friend and myself came into this restaurant to watch the hockey games last week and was served by an awesome waitress named Jackie. We came into Buffalo Wild Wings again tonight specifically to be severed Jackie again because she an awesome waitress and we will be well taken care of tonight"}
{"text":"just got to try this out while my brothers and i were looking for a place close by our rental home to watch game 3 of the nba finals.  we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table (original estimate was 30min- 1 hour because of the stanley cup and nba finals) and our waitress rosalie was very kind in changing some of the televisions in our area to the game. from where we were sitting a giant wall was blocking the projection screen and my 5'0 stature is a bit short of several inches to even attempt to look over.   we ordered only 36 wings for the 3 of us because we still had dinner with the rest of the family to go to. the 4 flavors consisted of parmesan garlic, asian zing, spicy garlic, and mango habanero. i dont really have a stomach for alot of really spicy foods and didn't try the mango habanero however my brothers were disappointed that the spicy garic had more kick than it. according to them the mango habanero had some kick but was more sweet than anything. the parmesan garlic kept reminding us of garlic bread but overall the asian zing with its sweet sort of teriyaki flavoring with a hint of zing was my favorite of the four.   it was my first time there at a buffalo wild wings and i know they have some in southern california so maybe if i ever stop by again i'll try another round of their many flavors but for now its asian zing all the way"}
{"text":"This is a review I've meant to be writing for a long time, but haven't gotten around to. I've been here three times over the past year, only when my friends come into town and want to catch the NFL games all in one spot. I hate writing negative reviews, because every business has a bad day, but I've never seen it with such consistency.  The service is just terrible. Every time, it's been full of disinterested servers. Busy days and fuller tables with a lot of needs get a pass from me, but the last time I was in, the restaurant wasn't even half full. I showed up to meet a friend, and it took literally 20 minutes to get a waitress in range that could take a drink order for me. And even then, she wasn't old enough to take beer orders, so she had to go tell someone else what I wanted. The beer took another 10 minutes to show, and the bartender had to bring it to me herself. For some reason, all of the servers hung out at the entrance to the kitchen and avoided giving any service at all.  My beer showed, and then I had to wait another 20 minutes to put in an order for some wings, and had finished my drink, sitting and waiting for a refill. This was again from a different server.  Then the game with the audio on ended, and switched to infomercials while two other games were sitting in overtime. We listened to the audio for some new orthopedic shoe while the games played out, and had a laugh about seeing how long it would take until someone noticed. They didn't until the games were over, and the TV was switched over to NBC's coverage.  We got our bill from a completely different server again, and I don't know if anyone was ever actually assigned to the table. Or the entire section. We seriously couldn't tell.  I'm giving it an extra star because the food was pretty standard for a Buffalo Wild Wings, and I don't have any complaints there. Nothing wrong with the franchise overall, I'd just skip this particular location if you can find somewhere else."}
{"text":"This bbw is trash. I ordered my food online and said it would be ready at 8 and it's now 8:30 and am barely getting my food. I managed a restaurant for years and I always taught my employees to be attentive to the customers around you. They literally served like 10 groups of people who either ordered there or arrived after me to pickup with most having triple the amount of food I ordered. One employee wrote down my name to check on my order and never came back with anything. My wings were probably just sitting back there and are all cold now or they lost my ticket or something. Honestly awful customer service. Their manager needs to better train those employees. I'd rather drive the extra ten minutes and go to the one is west Phoenix."}
{"text":"It pains me to not give this a higher rating. Back in the Midwest, I used to go to BDubs almost every day after work to meet up with friends. It was the place to be. However, after about a dozen visits to the Surprise location, I just can't get excited about going back (although my wife goes for Happy Hour regularly).  I will say their wings are the best, no matter which location you visit.   The service can poor at this location and that's really what is keeping me from giving a higher rating. The bar area is a bit crowded and seems to overwhelm the staff at times.   Be sure to give each of the wing sauces a try. They're all great."}
{"text":"Terrible service the last 2 visits, I am never going back have to ask for silverware and napkins. Ordered from the lunch menu and was charged full price."}
{"text":"Finally a Bdubs on the strip! I've been driving to the other off-strip location. This bdubs is very new and clean and open 24 hours, what more can you ask for. Its really big so the wait isn't long and there are plenty of TVs for sports. The wings are fresh and delicious. This is my go to spot for wings in Vegas."}
{"text":"Placed an order for pick up. The lady who took my order was very thorough (repeated back my order to ensure it was correct). All wings were ordered extra wet.  Upon arrival, my order was not quite ready... which was fine. However, when it was ready... I had them go over the order. As they opened each box, 2 out of 3 were not extra wet. The lady who went over the order agreed that they seemed like they needed a bit more sauce. She said she would take them back to have sauce added.   When she returned, she opened each box and we were both in SHOCK at the amount of EXTRA sauce was added. The wings were practically swimming in the sauce. (See picture - wings removed from the sauce to show the excess)  She sincerely apologized... \"I'm sorry, I am not sure why they did that.\" Was her response.   Unfortunately, I had my family in the car and we had waited long enough. If I had the time, I would have brought this to the managers attention, as it looked intentional and malicious.  Thus, my review and my rating."}
{"text":"Love their Spicy Garlic traditional wings! I ordered to-go and stopped at the bar while I waited for my food (I ordered like 50 wings with 5 different flavors). Anyway, I had a Bluemosa (sp?) and it was pretty good. Pretty interesting combination. I don't drink a lot but this was pretty good. I must've came here on a good day because it wasn't busy. Normally it's really packed and there is barely any room by the entryway. But since it wasn't extremely busy and service was fast and staff was nice. They won a good review from me."}
{"text":"man haven't been to Buffalo Wild Wings in years now I see why I didn't get wings this time I got there a poor boy sandwich with shrimp the bread was a little stale maybe eight pieces of popcorn shrimp and a s*** ton of lettuce the sauce that they put on their sandwich was tasted just like mayonnaise with ketchup also I had a spinach dip but that was still cold inside their server was okay he was a little behind because he had 8 tables which is ridiculous for a restaurant make server really slow and not attentive so I don't blame him for that I blame bad management probably will never go back unless I just want some wings because other food not very good"}
{"text":"Justin was our Server, he was very nice and calm especially with the crowd tonight with the Clemson vs Miami right here in Charlotte. Went ice skating tonight and we look right over and decided to pop in to Buffalo Wild Wings. Special thanks to our server Justin ! Also the hosts were great, found us a nice comfortable spot to watch the games !"}
{"text":"Our food order took over 45 min to receive on a early Wednesday evening. Once we got our wings, they were not cooked well and was cold as if it sat there before we got it. Not what I expected."}
{"text":"I've been here every Sunday for the World Cup. They have great wings with tons of choices of sauces. The even have a build your own burger section on the menu as well as many great appetizers to chose from.   My favorite is to start with chili con queso dip and a blue moon and a chicken sandwich with parmesan garlic sauce."}
{"text":"I used to come here quite often, especially when it first opened. Unfortunately now it seems like their quality has significantly dropped. Boneless wings are still fine though. A wing place with bad wings is sacrilegious."}
{"text":"This is the best BWW I have been to. Staff is always super friendly, the food is delicious and not once has my order been wrong for take-out. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and half of my food was missing. Order chips and salsa and only got chips and no sauce for my chicken.  No one seemed to even check my order to see if it was slightly correct.  When I called to complain the girl did not care at all.  Terrible service."}
{"text":"As a buffalo wild wings long time neighborhood customer I have been treated to a horrible experience. I have been  gambling watching MARCH MADNESS AS ADVERTISED ON THE DAN PATRICK SHOW TO MY SHOCK AFTER ALMOST 3 HOURS, I was charged for my draft beer and three cocktails for my daughter. Service by Trish was great, but I will no longer be stopping by for a beer  Dan Patrick has lied, BWW is not a MARCH MADNESS AND GAMBLING MECCA, STAY AWAY!!!  ."}
{"text":"I used to love B Dubs and this location was always OK. Never anything beyond what you'd expect but still good.   Well, apparently the wheels fall off the bus when they get busy and the managers simply don't care about the quality of the food and staff simply don't care about making orders right.   We places a pricey take out order. Upon picking it up, the person did the typical quality check - expect... our order was wrong. When pointed it that there was NO sauce on the wings, she said \"you got your sauce on the side\"... um that's not how we ordered it. Simple fix, right? So we get home and.... no sauce whatsoever. Call back and ask for replacement order. First the manager suggests just handing us some sauce - I'm not in the wing business but I know what happens to wings dipped in sauce that sit around ... they get soggy. So his solution was to throw sauce at us and let the other half of the order get gross... really? A manager suggested this?   If these people care about quality, and we certainly didn't see it tonight. Sad!"}
{"text":"great place... ask colby for some of his drink idea's"}
{"text":"Just walked in, are you kidding me?! Came after the club and the bartender Gordon, seemed like he had been up too long and upset. Got angry at us sitting down. We finally got served after 20 minutes being neglected after Gordon(who I felt talked bad about my group) served us. Ending up being good food at a light night hour. Bartender knows how to mix drinks as well. 1 star is for the service and respect they gave us."}
{"text":"It's such a bummer that the service here is awful because the food is good. There were so many tables open but a 20 minute wait and a manager walking around looking lost along with 3 hostesses just standing around. Wait staff is nice but no sense of urgency and I even saw the cook walking out of the back with a tray of food while yelling at the waitresses \"You complain it's slow but then you let the food sit here.\" Hopefully management steps up their game and trains the staff to provide better service. Good thing the food is good otherwise I'd go someplace else."}
{"text":"I always get great service here. I'm usually rolling through with my wife and daughter for a burger and iced tea. The Screamin' Nacho Burger is amazing! Especially after a delicious basket of fried pickles. We haven't had a bad experience yet, wmand it's definitely become a regular spot for us. We have tried other BWW locatuons, but, eh... we'll stick to this one."}
{"text":"Food is a bit overpriced, and the service is poor.  Took over 20 minutes, sitting at the bar, to get another one.  Glass was empty, and took me flagging down the bartender to get another drink.  Seems she doesn't care much for a tip, as she only got 10% which was being generous.  Spent more time chatting with her co-workers than doing her job.  Two beers, 8 boneless wings, and buffalo chips with cheddar ran $20.  Should have been around $12-14, so a bit over priced for the quality.  Not a recommended BW3's."}
{"text":"Fries are cold everytime, our pretzel was terrifying it was so covered in salt we couldn't even eat it. Our server got it taken off and was very kind. But bww food consistency is way off. Won't be back"}
{"text":"The food was ok but our service was horrible. Our family of four went today for dinner. Initially we were seated at a table but asked to be moved to a booth. Instead of moving us to the open booth the hostess cleaned off a booth in the back while we watched a party of two be seated at the open booth. Once we were seated it took forever for our waitress to take our order. Once we were served she never came back to check on us. We had to practically stalk her to get refills, a box, and the check. It was a terrible experience. I'd rather patronize a local bar or any other sports bar than eat here again."}
{"text":"Good food. Lots of T.V.'s for games. Staff was friendly unless you sit at the bar. I ordered 2 beers and they came quick. When I ordered water from 1 of the 2 bartenders, who asked what I wanted to drink, I never got it. I had to wait 5 minutes to ask the other bartender. I have been overcharged for beers here too, by same crappy bartender. He has said I ordered more then I drank. And yes I keep track, even while gambling."}
{"text":"We went later in the evening.  Place was pretty empty, at least 10 servers and it took over 45 minutes before our food was brought out.  No apologies, no excuses, nothing.  All we had was wings.... Ridiculous! And the food itself wasn't even that good.  Especially for the wait.  We will never go back. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Came in for some good ol' all American wings & French fries just to have the servers fight in front of us about them neither wanting to take our order,followed by server \"brian\" spilling a whole cup of water on myself.Service was incredibly slow and rude.."}
{"text":"This place has mediocre service. Ive gone about 4 times to eat in and every time i have terrible service.. It takes so long just to get seated even when there are seats available, you wait forever at the counter area just so someone can help you. twice i had to wait over 5 min just for someone to help me. The worst part, they never have the sauces you want.. being a huge place that serves wings you should keep your sauces in stock. I always place a to go order now if i ever want wings. but twice ive called now and they dont have the sauces they are advertising on the tv. thats a little weird. ive been excited to try em., oh well as soon as the person on the phone said we are out of these 2 new sauces, i just cancelled my whole order.. its a little ridiculous if you cant even keep the sauces in that are being nationally advertised."}
{"text":"Typical BWW as far as food and drinks go.  Service is a struggle.  Most servers are nice enough but are young and inexperienced.  We always eat at the bar and the service isn't any faster there.  Still a good place to watch a game...but definitely don't go if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is a decent place to eat and watch a game. Last time I went I ordered the chicken sandwich and it wasn't bad, but I think their prices could be better.   I did find that this location has really good service though. Our waitress, Trina, brought us refills as needed without having to be asked, which is something we really appreciated and something that you just don't see as much as you should these days. The wait staff in general was excellent as we had other people check in on our table.   We also really enjoyed the trivia game they have going on here. It would actually be a really fun restaurant to go to if only the food was better!"}
{"text":"If zero stars were an option this would be the most deserving place. HORRENDOUS service. Prepare to watch your soul die and your looks fade as you wait what seems like a Dracula bad never ending lifetime. The service isn't even worth calling that because it's just so egregiously bad but one can't ignore a basic expectation. You can wait a solid 30-40 for a drink and when they finally remember - after a gentle two or three reminders - that you did indeed order wings and they've been slowly rotting under the clearly visible heat lamp, it's not even worth the hassle of eating except you've been there so long that any morsel you may have previously consumed has long been digested and your stomach has begun eating itself. In a nutshell if you must have Buffalo Wild Wings find a different one."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!  Sunday night at 8pm. Service should not be this terrible. They weren't that busy! We should have known when it took 15 minutes for the hostess station to seat the 4 of us at a table that was clean and empty from the moment we walked in. We had 3 different servers. Drinks were empty 90% of the time, then when someone did refill them, forgot one persons. Food came over an hour after getting there. We had our food before we flagged someone down for utensils, ranch, and veggies we asked for once. I've been to several BWW, hands down this place is the worst. The waitor wrote down our order, but when it came time for the check, he asked what everyone had. Major problem, whenever you looked around for a server, they were all bunched together like high school clicks or on their cell phones.  Waste of 2 hrs and 75 bucks! Oh and to add insult, we payed cash for our bill. When my \"change\" was brought to us, he elected to keep the 76 cents owed and brought me back just the paper bills, not rounding up. Isn't that like stealing?"}
{"text":"Didn't like the serves , took them for ever to get us a server. Maybe it because we came at 10. But the one in deer valley is much better."}
{"text":"I love their food! Their blazing wings are my favorite with a side of blazing sauce. However every time I order it for take out they only give me 9 wings instead of the 10 I pay for. This has happened the past 6 times. Pretty soon I'll of paid for a whole meal I didn't receive."}
{"text":"Meh. Another chain restaurant/sports bar."}
{"text":"I came here to get chicken wings. They had a wide variety of flavors. The menu had many options. I come here once in a while. I only gave this place four starts, because they are a little expensive. All the employees are kind, and seem to know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Horrible service as always. Waited 20 minutes for waitress to come back around to ask her for our check then she brings back my credit card and receipt with no pen."}
{"text":"Wings were much better than expected. Loved the non alcoholic drinks, I had a black cherry limeade and it was dynamite!! Queso was okay but happy overall. Will return. Destroys crappy ass wild wing lol. Oh yeah, my apple dessert was sub par so I'd stay away from the desserts."}
{"text":"So we have a pretend manager Brian eating behind the bar, talking to a couple (one of which is a employee sitting at the bar Kat the name possibly sitting with a regular) while new patrons walk up and sit at the bar. No greeting. No hey can I interest you in a drink. The bartender, Alexa seems lost in the weeds (maybe she's training?) with no second bartender on. Nice as the world but lost. The servers are pulling their own beers. They come behind the bar to get ice because the ice in the server station isn't filled.  Station full of glasses off the bar. Brian is loud and obnoxious. I suppose there is a reason once I was treated well at Champaign location that I instinctively didn't try the Savoy location.  Seems magical but guy in a red polo walks in, ice is magically in the bin, glasses are done, and obnoxious manger (exhibit a) is no longer behind the bar acting up. Clean it up and you will gain customers."}
{"text":"A quality experience from start to finish. Within 2 minutes of sitting down at the bar I had been offered a drink and a menu. Drink was never empty and I felt well taken care of.  Both managers were hopping behind to help with drinks and customers Toree and Jillian I believe (spelling may be butchered).  Food was fresh and tasty. I had a chicken wrap with curry sauce. Overall a great experience. Not my first visit here but when you have a good experience the review is as key as the bad review when service is lacking."}
{"text":"Good wings.  Too bad they stopped serving carrots with them.  Don't order anything else though."}
{"text":"i dont know if i went on an off night but the food was HORRIBLE. The wings literally tasted like they came from a frozen bag, heated up and then tossed for a second in some gross thick ketchup mixed with tapatio. i couldnt even eat two of the damn wings i ordered.  I will never go back!! i prefer wing stop."}
{"text":"It's UFC night, we went to the other bar, they said each person spend $30 minimum. we had late lunch, so not that hungry, and our friend try here and we can buy the 25 minimum card per person instead of have to spend them all there. We spend them all anyway, but by force is different, right~ wings are awesome, BTW don't fooled by the \"mango\" by the \"mango habanero\" sooooo spicy!"}
{"text":"Awful service! Waited over 20 minutes after being seated. Not a single server approached our table to take drink orders or anything. Dean, manager at time, was awful and had no resolve to the situation."}
{"text":"Came for the opening NFL game of the Patriots against the Chiefs. Waited over an hour and a half to get our wings and still didn't get them. Complained to manager and got coupon of $5 off a $25 order in the future."}
{"text":"Great food. My server was awesome and was very enthusiastic her name was Alissa. She kept checking back with my party constantly and never let my cup go empty and gave me extra ranch. She was awesome!!! Another great person on your Wild Wing Team was Andrew. He had us fill out papers so we can sign up with our email and also let us chose a song to play in the restaurant. He is a great member to be on your team!"}
{"text":"I love the wings. Quick secret I do when I order. I get the wings plan with salt and pepper but I get the sauce on the side. The chicken is crispy and the sauce doesn't Soften the chicken. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because on 2 different occasions I called to put my order in and twice I was put on hold for more then 20 mins. Today I waited 45 mins for my food. I waited patiently but it was getting really bad. Tuesday are busy because of the discount wings. I would recommend if you go on Tuesday go after 8pm, it's slower and not as busy."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!!! I ordered lemon pepper dry rub and mango habanero sauce on the side and OMG!!! Life changing!!!"}
{"text":"Place was extremely packed but that was expected. We were greeted  and got a table right away. Our  waiter  was pretty good and attentive. Never tried  their onion rings before but they were DELICIOUS!!!  And the potato  wedges are always good. We got a combination of barbecue & mild wings and they were filling.  We will be going back when we get the urge and I recommend dropping in."}
{"text":"Not exactly the best wings in the world, but it's a lot better than All Star wings! As to why I'm giving Buffalo Wild Wings a 4!  Just like any other wing place, there's tons of sauces and dry spices to choose from! But I'm really plain jane and afraid of spice, so I just get the mild sauce!! The wings aren't exactly as juicy as I would like, but the fries do make up for it! Think almost McDonald fries.  Great service here too! Always serving you with a smile!  It's INCREDIBLY loud in here, so not exactly a place you'd want to take your sweetheart if what you're looking for is an intimate experience. I swear they have all 200 tv's at full volume.  I'm a huge fan of their banana cheesecake too!"}
{"text":"I have to urge everyone to check them out on Thursdays.  Every thursday nite from 8pm to 1am (when they close), everything in the bar is $3.  It was amazing, and this is every week.  I don't know how they get away with it, but it has to be one of the best deals right now for people with limited income with the economy.  I would recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"i stopped by here on my way into Vegas. I went a little shopping first at the outlet and it made me hungry. We saw this place on the way in so i decided to eat here. There's a BWW close to where i live, but i have not been to it yet. So this was my first time at Buffalo Wild Wings. I have seen the commercials about the customers not wanting to leaving and talking to the referee about extending the game. I did not think it was that great that i wanted to stay longer there. I know it's a commercial, but i would call it false advertising. lol.   So it was a Tuesday and apparently they have cheap wings on this day. You can go with one sauce or with multiple. The minimum per sauce was 3 so i got 5 Hot BBQ, 5 mild, and 5 Honey BBQ. I didn't want to fill myself up too much because there are so many places to eat in Vegas. My friend got the hot mango one and it was pretty spicy and left the lips burning a little bit. But it had good flavor so it was worth the burn the second time.   The service was alright...except she forgot 5 of my friend's wings. lol. I guess our order was too confusing or something. It took a while though to get my change from the bill.... but they were a little busy so it was understandable. I do not like to hate on restaurants. Usually there is a good excuse to why something is not going your way.   This is a good place to watch a sports game on TV though. Especially if there are multiple sports going on at the same time because there are so many TV's on every wall."}
{"text":"don't always cook their wings open them up so nasty!"}
{"text":"I come here often, a few times a month.  Service is a hit or miss here. Their berry lemonade is amazing! Definitely my favorite. Food is alright. I've learned to stick to their wings and fries.   When gambling, sometimes are drinks are comped, and sometimes they're not. A little bit of inconsistency here, but will continue being a regular."}
{"text":"Usually I go to the BWW on warm springs & durango, but this time we were near this one.  The food was good as usual, but the service here sucked. We stood at the host stand for a good 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. And there were 4 employees in front of us. One was taking a to-go order and the other three were chatting and trying to figure out how to set up a table for 8. Does it really take 3 people to figure that out? And couldn't you at least welcome us? Finally, the lady taking the to-go order finished and sat us..  Our server took forever to get to us. We were long ready by the time she finally got here. While waiting for our food, I finished my drink. Our server was at another table, so the manager/supervisor (?) brought us our food. I was waiting to see if she would offer me another drink. She didn't... Very professional of a manager. So we flagged down our waitress and she finally brought me a refill.   And the best part you ask? We were seated right next to a POS. The manager was standing there most of the time, gossiping with the waitresses. Couldn't really hear, but by body language and the giggles, it seemed like they were talking crap about guests.  I will stick to my original location where I am not ignored and where the employees don't gossip in front of guests."}
{"text":"Made a stop here after the republican convention ended. We were surprised they were open til 4am to accomodatate the RNC guest.  Our server was Michael.  He was very nice and helpful.  Other staff members were also helpful.  They were real cool to activate the closed caption features on two big screen TV'S in the restaurant to accomodatated my hearing disability.  Was glad to eat and see the convention highlights on CNN and MSNBC. Almost forgot. The wing were good and hot. Also had buffalo chips. Hope the eat at another buffalo wild wings in the future.  To follow up. This place from my understanding is new.  The restaurant was clean and had a lot of sports related photos and items posted on the walls.  Also for that sport fan looking to host a sports party they have lots of large screen TVs mounted on all the walls."}
{"text":"Went in Sat afternoon for the U of A football game, the World Series, and the Asu football game.  Service was very good. Maneuvering of the TV's for all the events was the best they could do, as Ohio St football dominated the premiere screens. This is strictly an Ohio State Football business plan, as we thought we were in Columbus Ohio.  Wives couldn't take the fans, their theme song after scoring points and the overall loudness, and they bolted.  Guys stayed until halftime of Asu game then moved on.  Too bad as it has been remodeled, the wings were good, the service was spot on, and there were the right games on the tube too.  Just one dimensional and in that it was just for the Buckeyes all night long."}
{"text":"After terrible service in summerlin ..again.. i headed over to this location and sure enough received great customer service at this location from our server Julian, took care of us, was attentive, made suggestions, patient, made us feel welcome alll at the end of his shift. Its a better business cus of you bruh, Thanks"}
{"text":"This is a good, casual place to hang out, enjoy a tall glass of Angry Orchard cider with a friend. Watch the trivia questions pop up. answer them and have some tasty wings.  I typically order a medium spilt order of boneless Parmesan Garlic and Teryaki nuggets.  The service is generally great and friendly.  This particular location is one I most frequent and would recommend.  BWW has a fan in me."}
{"text":"Attempted to come in here for a light late night snack service seemed to be on the slow side tbought there were quite a few parties we were walked by a few times before we were even acknowledge however im hoping the food will make amends for the service being this is the bwws i most frequent"}
{"text":"The wings are BIG - and there are about 2 dozen sauces to pick from!  The salad was good too!"}
{"text":"Bdubs is always a classic to go to. The food is pretty average and the staff is friendly. There wings don't compare to some other places, such as Quaker Steak. They have way too much breading and not enough chicken. It is tasty and they have a great array of sauces to choose from. It's a place I would recommend and go to once again."}
{"text":"Just got back from eating.  I used to love this place. But not tonight. Less than a minute after receiving my appetizers my food came right out. Got a kids Mac and cheese dish. My 12 year old took one bite and said it was discussing. You had to constantly stir from the bottom to bring up the cheese. I tasted it and found that some noodles were nice and soft while,  others were a little hard. The French fries were on the cold side. The server was very kind and pleasant. Also the tortilla wrap tasted as though it was store bought."}
{"text":"I'm new to yelp..but not new to bdubs. I'm Stephanie,  a server at this bdubs. I wasn't sure how to leave comments on other people's reviews or if I could. So I'm doing my own thing! I wanted to say thank you so much for all of the wonderful compliments! It is so great to hear that I'm doing a good job! It's encouraging to know that it's not going unnoticed! I strive to make everyone feel right at home when they come in. I'm there every Tuesday (don't forget! It's 60 cent boneless and traditional night!) and Friday night! So ask for me when you come in! I'll be more than happy to take care of you! See ya soon!"}
{"text":"Followup to my previous (not very detailed) review.  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me a 3rd time and...quit fooling me damn it!  I always enjoy my Spicy Garlic Wings. After my December visit I made the mistake of returning to this location in January. When my wings arrived they were clearly old (not fresh) and looked terrible sitting on the server's tray next to someone else's hot fresh wings. I pointed this out to the server and she replied the wings are \"always fresh\" which proved two things. 1st, she doesn't understand how the kitchen at BWW functions, and 2. She's blind. I asked her if it was her order would she accept it...her response was she doesn't like Chicken.  I then asked for a manager who proceeded to tell me the wings looked fine but she'll bring new ones...they look fine, really? I'll pass....and we left. Strike Two.  After two strikes I suppose I'm a glutton for punishment. I returned in Feb. for a third visit and I thought for sure the third time was a charm. The bartender was friendly and my wings arrived quickly. The wings themselves were a bit dry but I've lowered my standards and I was hungry! My second bite into the second wing I found a hair in my mouth. It wasn't my hair...DAMN! COMPLETELY DISGUSTING.  The bartender was very apologetic and took the food away quickly. She then informed the manager of the situation. This was a very heavy hispanic gentleman who came around the bar, leaned over next to me and said, \"so what happened?\"  You're kidding right...what happened? Didn't the bartender just tell you? Where's my apology? Where's your concern? What happened? REALLY?  On my way out I wrote down the name of the General Manager on the door and proceeded to call the listed number which of course was simply the direct line to the restaurant. The person who answered the phone didn't recognize the name I was asking for (HER BOSS) and after placing me on hold to check with someone else came back to advise me the GM is not there, comes and goes without warning and there is no way to contact her unless I leave a message. I chose to leave the message here instead. I still love BWW but will NEVER, EVER VISIT THIS LOCATION AGAIN."}
{"text":"Ordered online for quick meal and not the best food. Fries were horrible. Tasted old and reheated and wings were overcooked with very little sauce. Not the best work by Bdubs. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Visited BW3 on Friday 2/7/14 and wanted to share a dozen wings with a friend along with a few beers. The waitress informed us that the wings are now sold by the pound. She explain to us a medium order for $11.99 I believe the price was guaranteed to have a minimum of 10 wings. That's over $1 per wing. This is way over priced for a finger food. On top of the over price wings when I paid the waitress cash she asked me if I wanted change, seriously do they not receive any training. You never ask that and that's a perfect way to loose a customer, which is exactly what happen. I will not return."}
{"text":"Sorry you are not a real sports bar when it's sweet 16 of NCAA Tournament and you close at midnight with 2 games in 2nd half, both with less than 5 point margin and kick out 30-40 patrons! Really? No \"not really\" a sports bar. Ridiculous!! Plus your beer selection is decent but way too expensive! I know they dock it to you in franchise fees but this place is always busy. I wish a real sports bar would open in Strongsville and not just these whole in the wall places with old little tv's and unchanged decor for 20 years. You're basically busy by default so you can and do care less about your true core customer - the big sports fans. Bubbles burst and your!s will too!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great options for sauce. But quality of food of comparable to cafeteria food. Feel like Im eating at high school again."}
{"text":"Last night my friends and I ordered some wings and dessert online for takeout. When we got there our order wasn't showing up because it turns out we accidentally ordered it for 12 PM instead of AM, classic mix up! The bartender told us that it happens all the time but it would be about 5-10 minutes for the food and apologized. We got our food within 10 minutes and the order was exactly correct! The mix up was my fault but they still got the order out super fast"}
{"text":"Ok, but pricey.   As sports bars go, Buffalo Wild Wings is ok. Lots of screens, beers and wings.    I dropped by for lunch as a change of pace. An order of medium (15) boneless wings, the size of chicken nuggets, was $17.  They were ok, but nothing exceptional.  Many local pubs would win a taste contest.    I wouldn't rule out going back, but it would not be a first choice."}
{"text":"For what it is, it's ok. But you should know this place is smack up against a Chuck E Cheese.  Meaning every parent who backed out of Chuck E Cheese at the last second brought their precious little darlings here instead. It will be loud, it will will be crawling with kids, the service will erratic, and delivered by very young and inexperienced staff.  The food will be insanely salty, but the beer will be ice cold.  But some times you just want to stuff a bunch of wings in your face and get on with your life, ya know?"}
{"text":"This is the only BWW I have ever been to, so my review has no comparison for this place. Why a person who lives in the east suburbs of Cleveland metro area will travel all the way to westside to go to a chain which does not serve anything special? Answer: For the joy of playing trivia with friends. If it was not for the trivia, I would have never been to this place. So the trivia is working for business.   The interior and ambiance is quite generic with low light and many television sets. Wait staff is very nice and friendly. Most of the time chairs are not wobbling and music is loud enough to exercise your vocal cords. I have ordered veggie burger more than once here and it has been different everytime. Most of the time it is edible and sometimes enjoyable. I will be coming here as long as they have trivia and my friends are playing in the league."}
{"text":"This place is loud & full of TV's. I like sitting at the bar best because I can play the trivia business for fun. I'm not a \"wing\" person but they have some damn good dry rub wings that I just love. They are served in paper boats along with most of the grub which I'm not thrilled with but it's a sports bar not a high end sports bar so it is what it is. But hell even Denny's gives you a freakin' plate people. Ok enough of that bs complaining. Try the dry rub wings & stick to beer because more often than not they're missing items for the cocktails so when you're going here it's wings & beer. That is all for now."}
{"text":"Sometimes friendly and attentive service, edible food, and plain decor. Yep, it sure is a chain restaurant! BWW is actually one of my favorite chain restaurants. Note: the word \"favorite\" is being used loosely there. Much like a dental check-up is my favorite dentist experience. If you gotta go, try the mango habanero or the Caribbean jerk sauces. They are solid."}
{"text":"great service here! on a jam packed Sunday the staff was very organized and quick to seat us, serve us, and the food came out super quick!"}
{"text":"Went there to watch the football game was served cold fries. Also the wings we ordered were too hot not the ones we wanted. Then after we were ready to leave the waitress put all of the charges on my card when I gave her a gift card and cash to put towards the bill. The bill was $36 I gave her a $20 gift card $10 in cash and my debit card. She charged my card $30.84. I had to complain to the manager to get it fixed and I plan on contacting corporate because apparently the waitress thought she was getting a $30 tip"}
{"text":"Went because it's wing Tuesday half off. I ordered online and upon my arrival I was immediately and greeted. My order was just about done when I got there so I was only in there for about 5 minutes. I got 20 hot and 10 blazing.  Oh my the first time getting blazing and they are true to the name blazing.  They were nicely sauced and wasn't too overwhelming. Wings here are always huge so I'm a satisfied customer.     I definitely will be back.  Just wish they give you ranch or blue cheese with their specials to go."}
{"text":"My wife and i went for lunch the service was so bad 15 minutes for a server to ask what we needed her words ( what do you need to drink) told manager the service was bad he said well maybe next time it will be better sorry and just at this location at the chandler mall"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner around mid-night last night after work. Very good food, excellent service by Bianca, as well as late hours. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"its open 24/7 !!!  chicken is a great source of protein when you're partying vegas style (all day, all night). add some awesome wing sauce - and VOILA! tasty.   same chain, different city/location."}
{"text":"Not very happy. Understandably this is a chain but we always receive much better service at the one near home. Came in on a Tuesday and the place is basically empty. My husband like his wings fried crispy and he was told they couldn't do it. I would understand if the place was actually busy but I could hear a pin drop. We paid for our drinks and left- certainly won't be coming back and went next door to Winking Lizard where they accommodated with a smile"}
{"text":"Wow! Probably the worst service I have ever had!   My friends and I decided to go eat at Buffalo Wild Wings after an intense volleyball game for our friends birthday. As we got in we went to the bar. Unfortunately the birthday girls ID had a void on it due to renewal. So they would not serve her alcohol. That I completely understand. We were totally okay with sitting at a table and not drinking. I even pulled the waitress to the side to ask her to bring out a birthday cake for the birthday girl. We ordered waters and our food. As our food came out... we all took a couple of bites of our wings to realize that they were cold and our waters were empty for a good 10 minutes. When I tried to grab one of the waiters.. He made eye contact with me as I tried to call him over. Then literally did a 180 and ignored me like he didn't see me. I then had to get up to get his attention. At this point I was a little irritated. They went and got the night shift manger who didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. Instead he took our food and told us new food would come out. What really pushes my buttons is the fact that they brought a whole new basket of fries and Mac and Cheese. Which wasn't even cold to begin with. That was unnecessary and almost like a slap in the face. As Madeline came out she brought me a smaller version of what I ordered and proceeded to make a snide remark about how she didn't want  it to get cold. Once again unnecessary. Now the check comes, no apologies, no birthday cake, no satisfaction. Manager didn't even take care of us like a manger should. As we paid our bills in full I made sure to say thank you for the birthday cake and the cook yelled back telling us we were welcome. Another snide remark for the cake we never received.  You would wonder why a restaurant with 135 now 136 reviews is only 3 stars. I'm only giving 1 star because I'm obligated to in order to write this review. We won't ever be coming back to this location.   Thanks for ruining her birthday!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever   I came in 10 mins before they closed dinning and told me I have to be out by 11:30. If that's not the worst customer service ever then I don't know what is. I guess some people don't wanna make money."}
{"text":"My only complaints are the funny taste of the water and the lack of sauce on the wings. The water has sink taste to it. The wings I get are usually dry very hard to eat. When ordering ask if they can add additional sauce on the wings to get your money's worth. The wings I get are mild."}
{"text":"Went there to watch the Eagles vs. Chiefs game that was only aired on the NFL network. Parking is horrible! It shares a lot with a U-Haul place and the lot was full of U-Haul trucks! We ended up having to park in a gravel lot way back behind the BWW's. Once we got inside we were able to sit almost immediately though and had a server in a matter of minutes. The service was good and the food was standard BWW. Would probably return the next time I'm in the area and want to watch a game."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. The bartenders did not pay attention at all. Bathrooms are dirty and disgusting. They also have no good deals or happy hours during football games. I would highly suggest a different BWW."}
{"text":"The wings and drinks are good but the service is not great. Sometimes it's the only place open near work when we've finished and we always joke on our way there that it will take someone 45 min to get to us and another 45 min to get drinks. Even on slow nights it's not good."}
{"text":"Terrible food. I left 30mins ago and I already feel sick. You know when you eat something you wish you shouldn't have before you went to bed? #buffalowildwings"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up at 11:45 AM - no one in restaurant and still not ready 20 minutes later - not an acceptable service approach."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. First time there and the waitress didn't explain the menu but sure as hell charged me $0.60 for the tiniest cup of ranch. When we go to leave we walk back into the restaurant and 3 waitresses are standing there and won't move. One waiter told the girls to move and they still stood there. Worst first time experience and won't be back"}
{"text":"Hey I just want to give a huge shout out to Greg that works at this location. He's the light-brown-haired guy, incredibly efficient with his service, very polite, very fast, very attentive. I've gone here quite a few times but tonight his service was TOPS!  Good luck to you Greg, you're a model man."}
{"text":"Bww as a whole has lost my business. Extremely overpriced for less than mediocre food."}
{"text":"Ordered 30 bucks in food it was decent but I am very upset that every piece of chicken is a drumstick . But if I ordered all flats I would be charged . Then I call twice to inform , each time no pick up even tho phone reading for an extensive amount of time"}
{"text":"Really slow service, well over an hour wait.  And I'd have to be honest, the wings were underwhelming.  Kind of small and sort of bland.  Just not digging it I guess."}
{"text":"So sad to say, one of my favorite places to eat.  I'm literally in love with the spicy garlic wings and the potato wedges! I go here to often.  But sadly, walked in tonight about 8:45 with my brother. PLACE IS PACKED, we luckily got our food pretty quickly. My wings were almost cold, jusy slightly warm.. but it got to us quickly and we were hungry so we weren't upset.  BUT our server, couldn't have been more rude. Got our waters & never came back after she took our food order. A food runner delivered our food & we're waiting a good 5 mins but finally I MYSELF needed to stand back up to find someone cause we didn't get extra boats or napkins, (or anything in that matter because we never received a check in from our server to make sure everything was okay) soon after she has no problem dropping the check off, passing by repeatedly. Staring at us to see if we were ready to pay, finally snatches the check off the table while passing by. Returns it.. and let me tell you that we get it, it's busy but if you had NO TIME to even check on us throughout the entire meal, Jackie don't be so quick to take the signed copy from under my hand before I leave, anticipating your signed bill.  That was by far the RUDEST, and WORST guest service experience I have ever gotten.    Will not be returning to this location,  You can have the best food at even a FIVE star restaurant but if your guest service is horrible you won't have returning customers!"}
{"text":"45 minutes in and I haven't gotten my wings. I can probably count all the customers here on my two hands. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place is decent.  I like the boneless wings, buffalo ranch chicken sandwich, and the chicken Caesar salad specifically.  The cheese curds are good but just a bit on the saltier side (which I like to be honest).  I have been here at this location for lunch several times and really don't have much to complain about.  Service is acceptable, it isn't going to blow you away but they do a decent job.  Like any restaurant you are kind of at the mercy of who the server is, some are better than others.  Overall, prices are reasonable and I come here on a fairly regular basis."}
{"text":"Good bar type food. Fun to watch sports here while eating their chicken wings. Many sauces to choose from."}
{"text":"When my friends said they wanted to meet up here I was already against it. It didn't stop me from hoping they'd gotten better as a plus they had 50% off wings. The bartender was quick and nice and after putting in the order of 10 wings it went downhill.  The wings took 20 minutes!!! They came out warmed over and they weren't even tossed in sauce, they were drizzled with hot sauce. The person who delivered them rudely reached between me and my friend instead of delivering them on the other side of me. The wings weren't anything special- 8 wing segments and 2 drumsticks for me it kept getting worse and worse. It made me wonder where the heck are the drumsticks and are they scooping from a bin of cooked wings. The check took another 10-15 minutes and we were looking right at the bartender during happy hour, first we had to flag him down to get us the check, then flag him down to run the credit card and cash, then flag him down to get change. It's a hassle all around even eating at this place. During our long wait the manager decided to come around and ask if we wanted to donate money for a charity and get a sticker on the wall. I was beyond passed at the insult!!!! We are already paying for the food why don't you use the profits from that expensive drinks and wings and stop badgering your patrons!   BWW has always been on the cusp of going under. They have no one to blame, but themselves."}
{"text":"Service was okay. Took an unreasonably long time for the wings. You'd think a place that specializes in wings would be able to churn those puppies out. Nope! Be prepared to wait 30-40 min. Has happened both times I've went. One time was busy and another was not. The alchohilc drinks we got were pretty good, not overly sour or bitter. But for $8 you get mostly ice in the glass. The onion rings are tasty but very greasy, so you'll feel the illusion of being full once that grease hits your stomach. The garlic mushrooms were very tasty, no complaints. The first time I came here I got a small order of traditional wings in honey barbeque. Very very good, not too sweet, very little heat. The wings were alot crisper than I'd expect them to be but I really liked it. I hate eating soggy chicken skin. The second time I came here I got the same thing but they weren't as crispy. Will probably ask for them extra crispy as it looks like the second round was more of the norm. However my moms boneless wings were absolutely disgusting. The worst wings she's ever had. More breading than chicken, overcooked, and coated in so much sauce they were unedible. You could tell they made them the day before or even earlier and reheated them and tossed them in sauce. She got the honey mustard and teriyaki. The teriyaki is on the sweet side but it was so overwhelming she ate one small piece of that and the honey mustard and ate the carrots and celery for the rest of the meal in order to get the taste out of her mouth. We really couldn't ask for anything new because we didn't want to wait another 30-40 mins when we had a movie to go to. So these will be going to the dogs when we get home. The traditional wings are very good, but I would stay very very far away from the boneless wings. You could do better with Tyson fun nuggets. Overall I would come back to get the same thing I got last time but my mom won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The food here is ok... very overpriced in comparison to other wing spots. I got 'snack size' wings which were $9, a small is $11 and it goes up from there. The good part about BWW is their lunch menu/the variety of sauces to toss the wings. Strangely enough, I've had service here where they said they couldn't toss wings, only serve sauce on the side. Might be back."}
{"text":"I considered myself a regular at this Buffalo Wild Wings but not after last nights experience. Yes once we arriving we were told that we had to play the slots if we wanted to stay at the bar. We each put 5 dollars in the machine and ordered all our food and drinks. My group and myself go and watch sports there all the time last night we saw the golden knights vs jets game 3 along with everybody else around the bar. At the end when we asked for are bill the bartender Doug was very rude. He told us we laughed at the other bartender when she told us we had to play the slots which is a total lie and said my group wasnt welcome to sit in the bar area anymore during busy events. At the shock we just got up and left after the game. Mind you that nobody else was told they had to play to stay. One bad experience changes everything and Doug will get his wish as we will not return to that establishment. It use to be my favorite place for wings and sports and always had a good time with my buddies but looks like we have to go to a new place from now on."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! Went in around 10pm on a Monday night 5/25/15 and the place was dead! Sat in the bar area at a high top table. Waited 10 minutes till someone dropped menus. Realizing the bartender was the only person serving tables in that area, we decided to move to the bar to get more attentive service. Waited another 10 minutes to place order.. 15 wings and an order of onion rings. 20 minutes goes by and the bar tender notices we are getting a little impatient. He yells over the bar at what was believed to be a server asking them to check on our order. The guy (server) was too busy playing the \"claw\" arcade game and never walked to go check on our order. 10 minutes later we were fed up and got up to go find a manager. We walked past the kitchen and could clearly see our wings an onion rings sitting on the counter. The worst part of this is there were two servers standing right in front of the counter laughing and playing with each other and obviously not working. We walked out super annoyed and went next door to 5 guys where our service was amazing and food was awesome. Will never come back to this neighborhood BWW again."}
{"text":"Food was great! 3 stars instead of 4 because it was like pulling teeth to order the hottest wings. I get it, I'm a little blonde girl, but if I want to order the hottest wings, thats up to me. I ordered them and the waitress basically told me no, they were too hot. I insisted and she finally comprised to bring me a sample of the sauce before I ordered. fine. she brought it, i tried it, i said yes thats what i want. After a little more back and fourth she finally let me order them. and proceeded to basically watch me as i ate them as if was doing something impossible.  They're spicy obviously, but not THAT bad. I ate them all and was fine. I understand her wanting me to be warned in case i couldn't handle it, and she was very nice, but it seemed a little excessive when I was so adamant from the start. I wasn't hesitant at all."}
{"text":"Ok me and my bf were very hungry and saw that this place was open. When we first arrived we were so rudely approached by a woman , I think or maybe she was an angry buffalo. She informs my bf and I that no one under 21 can eat in certain areas. Ok buffalo bitch. We are way past 21 but thanks for the compliment. At least the hostess was very nice and polite. Our waiter was very nice and he even suggested a good flavor for our wings. All the food was very very good. Warning though their hot wings are HOT lol very hot. I could not finish more then one. If we are ever in the area again we will give it another try. And hopefully avoid the buffalo woman. I hope we get the same waiter or a waiter just as good."}
{"text":"Sorry Buffalo Wild Wings but if you insist on hiring stupid people then I am going to have to stop going here. I tried to order the lunch buffalito with chips and salsa instead of a salad. I have done this on numerous occasions in the past. Never been a problem. Today however, the girl told me she couldn't do that. I asked why since I have done it in the past. She told me there wasn't a button for that. I just wonder how they could have possibly changed it in the past without a button for it??? Makes you wonder.......   I'm done with them for a while. I really like the buffalito but the stupid wait staff out weigh my fondness for the buffalito.   There's not a button for that. Seriously?"}
{"text":"Had the appetizer platter and some chips and salsa.  The wings were good but the nachos need help.  They use a cheese sauce and cheese sauce, to me, is just gross and salty.  The Chipolte ranch dipping sauce was very good.  I certainly did not go away hungry.  Our waiter was very nice and quite efficient.  The place was clean and the bathrooms were super clean.  I don't usually go here so I am not sure if that is out of the norm or not.  We were greeted promptly at the door and seated.  Our waiter was right there and got us a couple of beers and took our order.  Our order came out as expected.  I have no complaints and having a clean bathroom is a super plus!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff, in particular the bartenders are awesome! My husband & I go fairly regularly but even if we haven't been in a while they still remember what beer we drink when we sit at the bar. They always suggest different menu items for us to try and their suggestions are always right on.  The food is always great. Of course I will always think Hooters wings are the best but Buffalo's wings are a close second. I enjoy their huge variety of sauces too.  The atmosphere is great, especially if you are into sports. I love going during football season and watching a game while drinking an ice cold Blue Moon.  The place itself is clean and kept up. The restooms are always kept up."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I showed up in the early afternoon on a weekday. So, slow and dead inside. Maybe 4 customers in the restaurant  when we arrived. Our waitress seemed nice, but kept referring to us as honey or dear (just a pet peeve of mine). We ordered a set of wings and pork sliders with fries. Took them over 25 min to finally get our food. For a place that was empty, that's ridiculous. The wings were hot, but the sliders cold. Sliders obviously made first and just sitting around... When we finally finish, she brings the bill. We were charged for 2 drinks when we only had 1 drink and one water. She had the hardest time understanding this for some reason...  Not coming back here, at least during the afternoon anyways..."}
{"text":"I live close to this bar and i have been over quite a few times for beers at the bar/big fight nights and game nights. No doubt the place can get overwhelmingly slammed at those times. Parking is atrocious then. During normal nights not really much traffic.   Service at the bar is not that great in my 25 or so times visiting in 4 years. Its very slow. The drinks and food are tasty, but sometimes that is forgotten about if food takes a while. I think if bartenders were more attentive this place would have a more attractive pull for me. Other than that, its an average chain sports bar with good wings."}
{"text":"Awesome location!   I normally do not come here, but it wasn't a problem at all.  Hostess Allison did an awesome job to make me feel right at home.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We really did not enjoy this experience at all. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, and the chicken definitely had the texture and consistency of frozen food that was reheated (probably in the microwave). The buffalo sauce was squirted on top of the chicken like ketchup. In my experience, the chicken is traditionally marinated/cooked in the sauce, so the flavor can permeate the meat. Also the french fries were cold. The servers seemed more interested in having conversations with each other than helping us. They did not offer us any beer specials, which I find disappointing at a sports bar. Perhaps this is why the restaurant was completely empty. I would never go there again."}
{"text":"B-dubs in Westgate isn't very fun. The food left something to be desired. Wings were cold and I felt like I threw my money down the drain. Good tv options for the game but stay away from cuisine."}
{"text":"Well the last 6 or 7 times we've eaten at b dubs the service has been absolutely horrible. Waiting 20 minutes for our order to be taken. The waitress disappears and never comes back with drinks or anything. And it's been likes this for a whole now. Remember Don Antonios? Great food horrible service...no because they are out of business. Remember steak? Right across the street guys. Sad that places refuse to acknowledge good customer service is the key to a successful business."}
{"text":"We got the lemon pepper,  honey bbq, blazing boneless wings,  onion rings and fries.  Lemon pepper is just  breaded chicken with lemon pepper seasoning (not that great)  blazin had badly any sauce and 2 were so hard they couldn't be chewed. Honey bbq were good.  Fries were a small order of shoestring fries that supermarkets sell,  onion rings were good.   Good was really really disappointing. :("}
{"text":"Friday night and was surprised to see that this place wasn't packed like most restaurants on a Friday night, but we've been to BWW before and felt lucky. Server was pleasant but the wait for our food was insane! We ordered an appetizer, I would rate it a 5/10... the boneless wings were more beading than chicken, the nachos were pretty much bare and the cheese sticks and onion rings were good. I ordered a salad as my entree and the chicken was so tough I could hardly pierce it with my fork... the to-go line was ridiculous- people were yelling for help. Needless to say, this location needs a lot of attention and work!"}
{"text":"This BWW location is home to the Charlotte Gators Alumni Club. I stopped in here to meet some friends who are FLA alums watching the USC/UF game on a Saturday night. The entire front room was dedicated to UF fans, complete with koozies and give aways. Tons of TVs!  While BWW food and beer is not free, it's a known quantity. The service and food here is what I expected. The shortside of this location is parking, I parked in the attached garage which is 3 bux an hour $$$. BWW validates for 25% off, which is nice but not quite enough for me.   I don't have much reason to come back to this BWW, but I would if in the area."}
{"text":"Super friendly service. However, the food quality fell a little short. Buffalo Wild Wings is a sports bar that serves a lot of different wings as well as other typical bar food.   I had the Jamaican jerk, and the wings seemed scrawny and small. They put a lot of sauce on the wings.  With improvements in food quality, this could eventually become a go to."}
{"text":"Stopped in this location after a movie on a late Sunday evening. The restaurant was just pretty much empty. We sat at the bar where the bartender Rosa greeted us and took our orders. The first two drafts I ordered both had tapped kegs but I was able to get a couple of free beers, but it took almost 15 mins per beer. Despite the empty-ish restaurant, our food still took 25+ mins. All we had was nachos, a snack sized boneless and an order of potatoe wedges.  The food was great and I would come back just to kick it with the bartender Rosa as long as the kegs are stocked this time, but the speed of the food and beer replacement was just poor."}
{"text":"We came in around 11pm on a Tuesday. We wanted to eat in the bar area but all the tables were filthy so I asked the hostess to just seat us. When we got to our table, it took forever for our server to greet us. I had a gut feeling that we may not see her again for a long time so when she took our drinks, we placed our order for wings and fries. The hostess who seated us brought our wings out but with no napkins and forgot the fries. She kind of just set the food down and left so we decided we'd wait for our server to get the missed items. And my gut feeling was right; our server had completely disappeared. She wasn't even busy with other tables. She was just gone. We finally got our napkins and fries and our glasses refilled after waiting ten minutes. When we were ready for the check, she was nowhere to be found yet again. Needless to say when she presented the check I wasted no time paying so we could get out of there asap.   I've eaten here before and from what I can remember, the service wasn't this bad. So instead of just one star, I'll give two since I can't recall anything terrible from previous visits. After tonight though, I'll be avoiding this location."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I've been sitting at my table for over an hour we got our drinks but still no food. They stated they never got my order. Families that came in after us have already being eating.   So now that we have mentioned the time the manager agreed to give us the food for free and waited 25 more minutes for our food to come out. We asked for it to go.    But let me just say that a family that sat in my area didn't receive any service so they walked out (no one cared) Even the \"captain\" at BWW came by asking everyone how's it going and just so happened skipped our table and the table next to us but asked the table behind us \"if everything was ok\"  and it's funny because all the other servers look at you but don't bother to help.   This is the second time I've had terrible service there and the last. Not going back anymore. Keep in mind this was mid afternoon on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Two days ago I ordered wings from here 25 minutes before arriving, I got there and had to wait another 25 minutes. I was patient and let that one go.  Today I ordered wings again and my order was done on time BUT once I got home I noticed I was given half the wings I ordered, I tried talking to the \"kitchen manager\" but he was being a prick to me like the was with me in the prior occasion.   This \"manager\" needs to learn to value the people that give him a job."}
{"text":"This place blows!!! We've been here 40 min now and still havnt gotten our salad and wings...ypu name is buffalo wild wings how does it take 40 minutes for wings this is not acceptable. ....fail fail fail"}
{"text":"All I can say is okay food and TERRIBLE customer service at EVERY location. I think it's in their handbook that they have to be slow and mess up your order cuz even getting a glass of water takes about 10-15 minutes!!!!"}
{"text":"We waited over 20 minutes for our order. All the while,2 other customers waited without being offered any help. This BWW is a lot different from what I'm used to. The hospitality is subpar and it seemed like the workers were busy playing around. I was a regular at my last BWW because they always went over the order with their customers and verified whether the food was made to order. I think this establishment would benefit if they offered their employees more training."}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had and I've had a server ask why I gave her the tip she deserved. My server was Cassidy and this is the second time I had shitty service at this place. We were her only table and of course when we were finished she decided to run to the back to do whatever she was doing and she was nowhere in site. Meanwhile I was sitting there with my boyfriend for 10 minutes just looking around to see if anyone could help us. To be honest we were thinking about just leaving because at this point no employees were even around and who knows when we were going to get the check. The funny thing was when she finally came with the check she took away my credit card faster than she'd ever been throughout the whole meal. Some people clearly are not meant to be servers and Cassidy is one of those people. We'll be going to the Savoy location from now on.  By the way 2 measly half filled cups of ranch is not enough for 20 wings and a side of potato wedges. Too bad our server was nowhere in site to ask for more ranch."}
{"text":"The waitress was really nice and the food was good but we went specifically to see the game and the TVs were messed up for about the last half hour. We missed about half or more of the last quarter. Even when we left the TVs weren't fixed."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up some $0.45 wings. Got a dozen Mango Habanero Wings and some celery. I called ahead and my wings were ready when I got there. The staff is always nice at this location."}
{"text":"Best ever! Everything from the wait staff ( Tony ) to the food was excellent! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"First of all, lets just say our waitress was so rude that at one point we figured we were on that Restaurant Stakeout show.  Second, we were there for over 1.5h cause our food took that long.  Third, they sure do not live up to their reputation as their wings were not even fully coated with sauce and most of the sauces we ordered were garbage.  On the plus side they have a great selection of beers on tap and they have plenty of TV's for watching sports."}
{"text":"I had a great time at the bar 2 nights ago. Jenna was our server and was great. thank you!"}
{"text":"We only come because my husband loves BWW. This is one of the worst BWWs that I have ever been to. Wait staff is great, but food takes forever to come out. 45+ for mediocre food and parties that had shown up after us were receiving their food before us. Not only that, AC wasn't fully functional. At one point, my infant's cheeks became extremely flushed so we resorted to fanning him with the menu and wiping him down with a wet rag to ensure that he didn't overheat. We couldn't get out of there fast enough."}
{"text":"Today we came to BWW to have dinner and everything is usually pretty good but today's service and quality was not good. Our waitress, Kassandra, had a really bad attitude and did not address our requests properly. Needless to say, will not be visiting again.   Buffalo wings should be coated in sauce, not be dry and lacking flavor.   Waste of time and money. Will be visiting Wing Stop next week.    If I could be contacted for a refund it would be nice."}
{"text":"For a place with wings in its name you would think they have awesome wings...  The wings are good but not great.  What else could you really expect from a chain?   My friend and I came here to watch the Machida v Rua 2 fight.  They have a $5 cover and then a $15 minimum per person.  I could understand one or the other but both is just wrong."}
{"text":"Rae was amazing! She was extremely friendly and was on top of everything when it came to our drink being filled and making sure our visit was enjoyable. She is an example to all servers out there! Only reason I gave 4 stars was because the kitchen took FOREVER to get our food out."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for my hubby and I to take the kids, hang out and enjoy some good wings. They are always so willing to let us taste and re taste the sauces and will even exchange wings if we really don't like the flavor we picked. We go enough now that we pick the same thing all the time but for newcomers don't be intimidated by so many choices. The fried pickles are SO good and they have some great happy hour specials as well.  The service has always been good for us and friendly.  There are a ton of good choices for beer on tap and bottled and overall it is a great spot. If you are looking for quiet though, pick someplace else. It is a very loud place and that makes it a great place to bring the kids;-)"}
{"text":"Wowo this wings has a taste of pre made ones,  Let me tell you that Walmart counter probably has better one.super dry and super old ,the sauce cover only half wing(look at my photo) also the carrot and celery probably already sliced 2 days ago(look at my photo)"}
{"text":"Don't usually eat here due to their firearms policy. They are not 2nd amendment friendly. However this was the nearest place to watch the Chiefs play.  Jamie was out waitress and did a fine job. Food was typical bar food."}
{"text":"Carissa was great. She had was extremely friendly, and very fast.. Definitely will come again. Love the service!"}
{"text":"Made my debut here with my friends from grade school from back in the day. wasn't too loud for a sports bar, which is a good thing. I dont like to scream while trying to have a conversation. We split the nacho app with chicken amongst ourselves. wasnt too bad. Maybe a lil pricey at $9.50. Next were the wings. We got the large 20 piece. It was nice that we were able to divide it into 4 different flavors. I chose the original \"Hot\" buffalo flavor. They didnt disappoint in flavor or heat. My one complaint about them tho, is that they could be bigger. Ive had larger wings at a cheaper price at other places. Lastly, I had the fish tacos. ($9.50 also) Decent size portion as you get 2 of them. You also get to pick a wing sauce to have them drizzle on them. I picked the spicy garlic. Very good. Our server was named Aimee, I think. She did an excellent job running around for the 6 at our table. I would return here for more wings, but maybe only on a Tuesday or Thursday when they have wing specials."}
{"text":"If you want a sports bar and Chicken Wings, this is your place  Service is terrific.  One can get Chicken Wings prepared any way and whatever size they want.  Not healthy, but yummy."}
{"text":"This is my place to go , may be because it is near to my place or may be their lunch specials are awesome .:-) My hubby always go with the buffalo wings with garlic sauce and my choice always with their mac and cheese with chicken and garlic bread on side.  On weekends this place is always crowded especially during the evenings. Also we noticed the beer prices are pretty fine on their happy hours.I would not be able to give more stars for their staff promptness. However their dishes taste is awesome. I would suggest to improve on their hospitality grounds."}
{"text":"Not sure why this one has 2.5 stars.  I think its great.  Good food.  Good service.  TV's situated great on inside and fair on patio.  Also has the tablets to play all kinds of games for both adults and kids"}
{"text":"Ordered medium boneless wings, and their philly cheese steak sandwich.  The boneless wings were cooked hard, and barely had any sauce on them  The steak sandwich was overly salty  Overall, it was a big waste of $20, as I couldnt make it half way through any of the dishes I ordered."}
{"text":"My favorite Bww in the valley. Friendly and cool. The food is alright."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this location. The food was subpar each time I've been."}
{"text":"Ordered to go and our food was ready in no time! I love their wings and onion rings! Had the left overs the next morning. Tasted so good that I wanted more for lunch. Plus they are open 24/7. Awesome!"}
{"text":"This BW3 is easily one of the most terribly managed I have ever been to. Tonight, on a Saturday, my party of 8 received terrible service. This is especially unacceptable considering it was not even busy and there were plenty of staff members running around to serve us; but they seemed disinterested in providing any service at all. We literally had to work for every single drink and so did everyone else at the restaurant that evening. I even had to walk up to a manager in order to receive my check. One star all the way."}
{"text":"The experience here wasn't the greatest. From the \"welcome\" to the food, everything was just \"ok\". I ordered the medium (15pc) boneless wings, three different flavors. Some wings were ok, the others were dry (not dry rubs) and barely dipped in the sauces. The boneless wings here tastes like Wing Stop's boneless wings now - yuck!    Had the service been better, it could have made up for the quality of the food.  BWW has definitely lowered its standards in the quality of their food, presentation of the restaurant, and its employees."}
{"text":"Not a pleasant experience whatsoever. Came in to enjoy lunch with my 15 month old and the waiter, Dakota, casually greeted us and took my drink order and then disappeared for 10 minutes. Walked back, still with no drink for my son, and asked if I was ready. Then he comes back with a bottle of frozen milk.   After I received my check, I waited 15 minutes and had to get up and hand the check to a hostess so I can leave. Overall I felt completely ignored and I feel as though I wasn't given the slightest regard because the waiter felt it necessary to talk to his buddies about working at McDonald's.   The thing is, I've had was better service at a McDonald's. I'll gladly drive an extra 5 miles to another location for better customer service."}
{"text":"What a fun place to hang out at! The food is really awesome.!!! The atmosphere is full of fun, there's so many televisions to what sporting events on too and the staff are very friendly.!!! Looking forward to my next adventure with Buffalo Wild Wings.!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Just beware when ordering take out. They are great at screwing up take out orders so make sure you take a look at your food in the boxes before leaving."}
{"text":"Food is typical BWW, cocktails aren't half bad for a sports bar oh and they have Fosters \"Oil Cans\" jackpot"}
{"text":"Hhmm..not a fan.  The noise level is really loud so not good for little ones & in depth conversations.    Ordered garlic wings..medium my butt..they were hot!  Salads were just ok...lettuce was wilted and Brown.  Fried picked were ok though the pickles were thin & soft. I would have enjoyed spears.   Service was really bad- Melani sucked!  She forgot drink orders, didn't look like she wanted to be there, didn't specialize orders correctly and we hardly saw her."}
{"text":"Steven and I went in here today and it was okay. It's one of those places that you'll normally keep going to no matter what (within reason). I got the pork sand which which I always get & they changed it and it absolutely SUCKED! I have NO IDEA why they changed it from how it was because the bun was not good, the coleslaw and onions were weird, and the prom tasted different the only thing good was my fries and the BBQ sauce on mine. Steven got a variety of wings & they were all delicious so when we go back it'll be for those from now on, but it will take a while to return unfortunately. & we really didn't have service at all & when she was there she was leaning down on our table which we didn't like."}
{"text":"Goddamn this place has slow fucking service. Been coming here for years and every time I have slow ass service. It takes an arm and a leg to get refills and to put new orders in.. and my wings came out cold.. I really wanted more wings.. but have waited so long for service I lost my appetite and i feel like Our waitress dissappeared or clocked out or something. I've been meaning to leave this 1 star review for a long time.."}
{"text":"I thought Buffalo Wild Wings was revamping itself to make it better. Well they still are horrible.   Went arrived a little after 6pm before the Coyotes Yarnell Practice Game to grab some quick food before we went in. Quick never happened. Trying to get a drink or let alone a refill was hard work.   Our friends ordered potato wedges for an appetizer, it took them three tries to get it right and then some were cold in the middle. Our entrees took over a half hour to come out and they didn't want to give us any ranch for some reason.  We had to ask our server what the status of our food was, she left and came back 5 minutes later saying they are plating it and the manager was personally bringing it out to us and was going to talk to us. A few minutes later he brought our food and said nothing. No apology. Nothing.   We ate our food, except the person who ordered wings because they were so awful he couldn't eat them. Our server gave us a $5 off coupon for our meals. More than likely we will never be back."}
{"text":"To be honest, if I didn't have a friend that tends bar here, I probably never would have gone. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, and since its less than a mile from my home Pub (Tim Finnegan's) I have little reason to stop in.  When I did, it was exactly what I expected. Lots of TVs with sports on, decent beer selection and \"meh\" food. I will be honest, the wings at Tim Finnegan's are better, which is sad considering that is kind of Buffalo Wild Wing's staple menu item.  The other challenge is that this and the new Olive Garden building are in a... less nice part of Metrocenter circle, right next to 2 cheap motels. Good if you wanna score crack or a prostitute, bad if you want your car to be safe in the lot after dark.   If you wanna watch a game in a chain restaurant, this is the place. If you wanna hang out in a bar with some personality, drive a mile south."}
{"text":"Hit BWW last night to watch the UFC fight with a pretty large group. The restaurant/bar was super flexible with us and took good care of us. WE had a barage of drink and food. I tossed back a few cold ones and had a solid burger. Didn't try any of the wings but many people at our table did and seemed pleased. Overall it was a good atmosphere and well priced. I'd go back if I was in the area"}
{"text":"Love coming for happy hour,  angry orchard on draft + so many more! Salt and vinegar fries are my favorite, although they are always stingy with the queso dip.... sometimes too runny, other times not enough chili always disappointed with that.....everything else is good!  Bartender and servers are always friendly"}
{"text":"I went here with some people from work for lunch. I was very Excited for the $.60 wings that were happening every Tuesday. I rather enjoy bone in wings. When we got there is ordered we were toldthat blue cheese would be extra. She told us that, because we were getting the $.60 wing deal, that all sauces such as blue cheese or ranch would be an additional $.60 per sauce. I was very upset about that, and I wanted to leave then. Unfortunately, the people I was there with wanted to eat Buffalo wild wing that day. Checking the price the $.60 wings deal was too good to pass up, so I decided to stay and eat. When the wings came out, they were very well cooked which is how I like them.I noticed that the sauce didn't cover the wings all the way. It appeared that they had toss the wings and the sauce but didn't have enough sauce to completely cover the wings. When you order buffalo wings with the sauce you expect there to be sauce all over the wings and not just on half of it. At this point, I was getting a little upset about the need to pay $.60 for my blue cheese when I had wings I didn't have enough sauce. It strongly appear that they were trying to cover the cost of having a $.60 wings special by adding the cost to the customer and the difference by making them pay for blue cheese or ranch.  I am never again coming to this location for the $.60 wings special day ever again. You cannot offer a special to your client event bury, in the details, price is that the client needs to pay. What's next? A day when the wings are $.50 but water cost two dollars? Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant several times a month and have rarely had an issue. However today was a huge turn off and ethically questionable. The location was incredibly busy due to it being an NBA finals night. We were 5th in line and told it would be a 35-45 minute wait.  The seating area inside was busy so we stepped outside to wait. Soon after 3-4 additional groups of people came in after us. A waitress steps out for a moment and says \"wow, there's a lot of people waiting\" and went in a direction towards the parking lot.  Upon returning she approached a party of 3 who had come in 2 after us (making them 7th in line), skipping several other parties and offers to seat them in her area. Multiple people had a look of wtf is she doing. I complained to the manager who knows us from going so often and he apologised and said he would talk to her because a waitress shouldn't even be seating people.  Finally we're seated ourselves and I immediately recognized our waitress to be that same shady and unethical waitress Rosario. I got up and told her she's the one doing the shady shit and I'm leaving. No way my family and I are going to enjoy a meal served by her and I would never want to have to tip her.  It was too much of a coincidence but I'll chalk it up to bad luck. I see the manager on my way out and notified him what occurred. He offered to get me another waitress and I refused, in the end I was angry and not interested. Waitress should have been sent home or dismissed."}
{"text":"I came back and Doreen helped us at the bar. She was great! She made conversation and encouraged me to try the siracha wings which were AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We go here to watch our Tampa Bay Bucs play football since their games are rarely aired here in Ohio.   They always put our game on the TV we ask for.   The only issue is that the bartender really needs either another bartender or a helper.   She was behind on drinks for her bar patrons having to get drinks for the entire waitstaff too.  The Manager needs to learn to staff better.  Or give Chelsea our bartender a few extra bucks to work alone.   We typically tip at least 20% but only gave her 12%.  She was okay but could have handled being behind much better.   And by that I mean through conversation with her people at the bar so they could understand.   And not by negative talk but positive towards the establishment.   I heard an emoyee state hey don't trust the kitchen... And several other patrons also heard and commented.   Good food and staff is always pleasant."}
{"text":"Everything is always mediocre. The food, the service, the atmosphere.  We usually order the medium and the spicy garlic with a side of ranch.  On the bright side the beer is cold and decently priced.  They need to rally around their staff to get them more pumped up!"}
{"text":"In just a couple of words... Absolutely horrible! Worst wings I have ever had and shameful overall experience for a place that specializes in wings. Do not waste your money here as there are many places to go where you can get quality wings, homemade, and fairly priced. Enough said."}
{"text":"Stopped here for some late night (10 pm) food.  Had a coupon for free snack size wings.  Ordered Jamaican Jerk wings and side of fries.  The wings were very tasty...lots of heat and spices.  I thought they were a little small for a Wings restaurant.  The fries, which were $2.99, were about the size of a small fry order at McDonald's.  Also they were warm at best when brought out to the table.  Service was good!  My server Brittany kept my drink filled for me and was very pleasant during my visit there."}
{"text":"I've been here once a few years ago and wasn't a big fan, which is why I never came back. Quality of the food just wasn't that great...  BUT I came here with a bunch of friends to watch the Mayweather vs. McGregor fight (the birthday boy chose this location). We had tables reserved on the patio which was nice! Weather was a little bit chilly as the night went on but the atmosphere is very relaxing/chill and we had a great time!  I was a little worried about the food but of course, it's a wings place soooo thought I'd give it a second try! And honestly, they were pretty good! I'm a \"dry\" flavoured kinda wing person and I always go for \"dry Cajun\".... not the best but they were crunchy, fresh and flavourful!   Since we knew we'd be there for a while, we saved some room for nachos! I mean....who doesn't love a batch of nachos with a glass of cold beer on a Saturday night?!? Welllll, it was quite disappointing the nachos SUCKED! Worst I've ever had! The chips were very salty, it was covered with -what tasted like- cheese whiz (yuck!), a meat sauce and the whole thing covered in a mountain of diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce.  You'd think it'd be pretty hard to eff up nachos but these guys did a great job of doing it unless you like very salty chips, cheese whiz and a mediocre meat sauce then I guess you'll love these!   So wings were good, nachos ruined it. I still wouldn't come back. Unless of course I had to."}
{"text":"Have been here many times. Great food. Your server can vary, i've gone from great to \"eh\" but never bad. Came here to watch the fights. Put a nice dent in their kitchen with nachos, chicken, and mozzarella sticks for good measure. Can't lose  with BDUBS"}
{"text":"Kid friendly. Like a combo sports pub and restaurant. Food is decent, but I prefer Winking Lizard's cuisine and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great sampler, wings, everything was delicious. The service however was the best thing about tonight. Our server and the person who let us taste sauce and beers were so friendly. Atmosphere nice too. No complaints this McDowell BWW location is awesome my family and friends will be back."}
{"text":"Great food with great service. Staff are super friendly and helpful with suggestions on wing sauces and what beer would compliment your order. I just wish they wouldn't change out their beers on tap so often."}
{"text":"Always a good spot. Been coming here almost 2 times a month. Can't beat the good service and the good vibes."}
{"text":"I have to say, I really debated on how many stars to give this particular location, but have decided to settle on three.   Let me start off by saying I love eating at Buffalo Wild Wings, especially this location, but the service I received a few months ago still has me fuming.  When my fiancé and I arrived, we were seated almost immediately. Considering it was a weekend, I was pleasantly surprised. We chose to sit on the patio.   We sat down and were soon greeted by our server. He took our drink orders and when he returned, we were ready to order our food. After placing our order, we waited for about ten or fifteen minutes. Considering we live in Arizona, it is natural to drink a lot of fluids and in within that ten or fifteen minutes, my fiancé had finished his drink. When our food was ready, it was delivered to our table by one of the hostesses and my fiancé asked her for a refill. She politely said yes. While she was away getting his refill, I realized we didn't have any silverware, and so when she returned I asked if we could get some. She looked at the empty glass on the table, didn't take it, said \"Oh yeah\" and walked away. (Now I know all we ordered were boneless wings and celery, but due to a horrible experience at the dentist, I am unable to bite down on my front teeth; therefore, I require a fork.) After my fiancé had finished his eighth wing, and I had not had one, he left the table to get some silverware as the young girl we had asked had obviously forgot. Because he is a lot more understanding than I, he decided not to confront her and returned with some silverware and asked me to drop it.   I was still fuming. We finished our meal and in the time we had received our food and finished, our server only walked by our table one time, not to refill our drinks, not to ask us how our food was, but instead to say \"I can't believe they forgot the silverware!\" In the words of my fiancé (who asked me to drop it) \"Good cover.\" Obviously word gets around fast....and through the whole ordeal, I also needed a refill, which I never got. Please think, when was the last time you ate a a restaurant and DIDN'T get a refill...that's what I call sh*ty service. Anyways, my fiancé still gave a 15% tip. Clearly he is more understanding than I.  ...and that's how no silverware, no refill and no \"how is your meal\" gets Buffalo Wild Wings at Happy Valley Road a not so great review."}
{"text":"We were craving wings, it was a Saturday so we checked it out and it was very good. Good wings, cold beer at a very good price, lots of big tv screens the Olympics were on so kids loved it ,the music was loud so it made our Saturday night a good one."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to this Buffalo Wild Wings often,  we find the beer selection is excellent and cold.   The bartenders are friendly and fast.   The Manager that we like makes a long drive to run this location,  he shows he really cares.   He always has a smile.  Since we are regulars,  we see the interaction between the staff and the customers, I will say it is unequaled.   Great TV's all over the place and they will put something on for you if you ask.    Very up to date and a great atmosphere.  I find the Onion rings are some of the best you will find.  The Wings are large and really done well. Just an all around great place to go.   I would highly recommend this location.   It is run very well and is very clean.  UPDATE:   It appears the owners of this location which I thought was doing great are planning to close this location down and move the franchise  to Casa Grande.     What a shame  This is a great location."}
{"text":"Ate there last week with my family. The food took forever to come out. We had to ask the manager when it was going to come out and he didn't even come back to check on us when it finally did. My wings weren't even warm and the fries were cold. It wasn't even worth complaining about because it was clear that nothing would be done about it."}
{"text":"The food is ok, nothing special. The service is inconsistent, and the manager is useless.  If you find yourself at this location against your better judgment ask for Katrina. If you like your wings on the crispy side, you'll have to ask for this as they tend to come slightly undercooked (i.e., soft skinned). I forgot to ask, so I was slightly disappointed with my wings.  The best flavors of wing sauces are the Jamin Jalapeño and Spicy Garlic.  I have attempted to eat at this location twice before. Yesterday, I managed to stay without leaving before I was served. Even so, I experienced the same problem at the hostess stand as I had two times previously.  There seems to exist a fundamental problem with the manner in which guests are handled when they enter this BBW location.  Unlike most BBW locations that seem to have a half-dozen teenage girls/boys at the front podium, this location tends to have one or two. Everyone else seems to be hiding in the back - I guess. If the hostess is in the middle of taking a take-out order, you could wait for a very long time without so much as a greeting. I consider waiting without a greeting or acknowledgement to be problematic after about 4-5 minutes because it only takes a second to tell a guest you'll be right with them.  Since my friend selected the location with a strong desire to have wings and a cold beer, I agreed to give the place another try. Thankfully, our server Katrina saved the day. She was very pleasant, attentive, and accommodating.  Although the food did not meet with my quality standards, the service and my cold Angry Orchard ciders on tap did. Couple this with some great company, and the venue worked out to my liking.  Ironically, the poor greeting turned into a rather red carpet exit when two staff members sent us off with a pleasant good-bye and grabbed the door for both of us on the way out. Upon quickly comparing my greeting, it felt a little surreal. Although I am not looking for a red carpet entrance, guest should be welcomed and feel like a valued guest when they enter."}
{"text":"I have probably been to most the Buffalo Wild Wing locations in Las Vegas at this point. I am used to snotty service by teenage waiting staff with an inconsistent culinary product. However, my love for cider with wings and particularly Buffalo Wild Wings' sauces keep me coming in for  an occasional visit.   This location offered great service by Irma and quick good wings that were extra crispy as requested. I enjoyed a pint of their Angry Orchard Apple Cider as he enjoyed his dark tap beer.  We tend to order a lot of bone-in wings and enjoy mixing up the sauces. You can get four sauce varieties per large order. My favorite wing sauces are Jammin' Jalapeño, Spicy Garlic, and Caribbean Jerk - all dipped in blue cheese dressing.  This visit we tried a new appetizer called the Irish Potato Wedges. This was a generous portion of potato wedges topped with bacon, melted cheese, and chives. They were delicious."}
{"text":"Buffalo wild wings is an ok establishment like what other people said its a Hit and miss the appetizers were not that great, the burgers were ok I took a friend of mine that went with me and someone else and I got his professional feedback that the wings were great they were frozen not fresh. The Burger was not the greatest I have had better burgers then that the bathrooms needed a little attention plus no soap in the bathroom which is a major health code violation for the both customers and employees wonder. It makes you wonder if the employes or sever wash their hands before the food came to you."}
{"text":"Currently sitting waiting for over $100 worth of carryout. They said it would be ready at 6pm... and we arrive on time to be told they need 10 more minutes. This obviously means they didn't start cooking till we showed up. Why bother setting a pickup time?!  When I asked for extra ranch to be packaged in the meantime they \"checked\" my order and determined we only \"can get\" 8 extra ranch sauces to go...  What a rip off. If they hadn't already ran my card and I didn't have my new inlaws in town waiting at home we would have left.  If we were dining in they would never limit the party of 7 adults (plus children) to 8 ranch cups.  RIDICULOUS."}
{"text":"Lately their mark has dropped so much. Quality of food has been degrading and service is not like it used to be once. Very disappointed how things are, that's why they are not that busy like they once was. Order To Go once, it took over 10 min just to get someone to take my order, by the time the food came out i was ready to tell them to do something with that food and put it somewhere . Not even a simple I'm sorry for taking forever to get you a chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"This lady Shawntelle (however tf you spell it) was by far the rudest waitress I've ever experienced in my 24 years of living . I love this establishment but this lady made what had potential to be an excellent date night a horrible event that has plagued my opinion of Buffalo Wild Wings everywhere. And be sure to check your math when you receive the final check ."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Thursday. The place wasn't very busy but service was so slow. it took nearly 45 minutes from when we arrived until we received our food.  otherwise the service was pretty good.  My drink was never empty and the staff punched our lunch cards extra and apologized for the wait.  I got the boneless wings and they were just mediocre. My fries were a little cooler than I would have liked.  Overall, it's not the worst place to go for lunch."}
{"text":"This location is a million times better than their eastern location! The staff are friendly and attentive. We were seated as soon as we got into the restaurant, the server came over less than 2 mins after we were seated took drink and appetizer orders, asked if we had any questions and then took our order. The waitress came back multiple times during the meal to make sure we didn't need anything and even at one point struck up a conversation. The food was hot and fresh and tasted great. The restaurant was a little busy since it was lunch time but the wait staff was able to keep up. This location is always consistent with food and svc and I wish this location was closer to my house. One of the things i love is they are so quick i have time to eat during my work week because i can get in and out in less than an hour without breaking a sweat!"}
{"text":"The food is always good and fresh when we eat here. I gave it 3 stars because the wait staff are not attentive, they always seem to be in a rush which dosent give them the opportunity to be friendly. We always have to wait to be seated because no one pays attentuon to the front. Then we have to wait for them to clean the table off and then they think your going to sit on a wet seat. The waitress gave me a funky look when i asked her could she get a dry towel to dry off the seat. The food gets no complaints from me its just the servers that fall short. I want to know hiw a place that sells hotwings that the servers dont make sure you have something to drink. My husband and I recieved our food and finished and still have not seen waitress to get a refill and my mouth is on fire from wings they need to do better"}
{"text":"When it comes to BWW, I expect the same mediocre experience every time.  Inattentive wait staff, noise, and adequate food.  Well, fellow Scottsdaleians... I was proved wrong.  Walk into this BWW unlike any other and there are a countless number of TV's plastered on the wall.  Be greeted by the hostesses up front and welcome yourself into the bar area of bliss.  Seating is plentiful and this was the best BWW experience I have ever had.  I don't have one complaint!  We were both in shock over how amazing the service was here.  We stuck to the lunch combos on this one.  They were very happy and willing to put extra toppings on the fries (queso, medium sace, and bacon bits) at an extra charge.  They have awesome tablets to play trivia on instead of those grimy 1990's looking keyboards.  We have found our new BWW and glad to say it's one of the best!"}
{"text":"You can count on great service with great food. I love their wings and onion rings. When I was on on a special diet, BW's was able to accommodate me. That makes this one of the best sports bars around."}
{"text":"Have always loved this location,  and though I finally have a BW3 in my backyard in NYC, I always make a habit of hitting this one up for old time's sake when I'm home. Had a great visit for lunch this week. The staff was friendly, and kept my son entertained with games. The wings, of course,  we're out of sight.  We'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"Okay, before everyone jumps on me for 4 stars, given that there is not really any other place that gives you half the selection, this is pretty good.  I had gone to BW3 many years ago and grew to really dislike it.  Wings looked like they were fresh off chicks.  But, I must say they have gotten bigger and better.  I can only speak for the dry rubs, they are really good.  The portions are also really big.  This shop is always clean and the service is spot on for me.  I have not been here during some sporting event, so can not speak to crowed control though.  All in all I will continue to come back until some other better alternative presents its self."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick beer and some boneless wings.  The same vibe as any other BWW's.  The service was friendly and the meal was the same standard one can expect at any Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"I've been a lover of B-Dubs since I lived back home... so this place is like a little slice of home to me. The staff is consistently nice & they have shown consistency getting our orders correct and out in a timely manner.  So a few things are different about this Buffalo Wild Wings than the ones back home, if you're new to town like me...  -It's open 24hrs. So if you have a random craving for an assortment of chicken wings, you can swing by at any time!  -As with most places in Vegas - there are video poker machines at the bar. They have keno as well!  -There is a pretty sweet happy hour! Mon - Fri 4-7p, (select) $3 appetizers, $3 drafts, $3 Jack, Captain,  or Absolut drinks... I do believe there is another alcohol listed, but I can't remember right now :(   Other than that, if you've been to one B-Dubs, you've been to them all. I just can't emphasize enough how great the service is here though - it truly is a neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Wish I could give \"0\" stars as this is truly deserved and here's why...we came today (Sunday big NFL day for Panthers). We expected it to be busy so we knew we'd have to wait. We put our name on the list and proceeded to wait for a table in the bar area. We saw a table open up and we knew we were next on the list so I went to the hostess and she told me that the Manager put a hold on seating people because the kitchen was backed up. I asked to speak to the Manager and let her know there was a table available and since we were there to watch the game (like everyone else!), we really just wanted to sit and have a couple beers and were in no rush for food anyways. While all this going on, another couple took the table with no wait. She comes back (manager is a female, short with long dark hair in a ponytail) and offered us to share a table with another guy who had just ordered a beer. Ridiculous can't even describe this manager!!  Common sense tells you if you have a long wait and there are open tables (because the Manager is telling the hostess not to seat anyone), disorganization and people just taking tables unfortunately is the next scenario. Other than being offered a wonderful option of sharing a table with a complete stranger (which she approached him on and he did not offer up himself...awkward??), we were offered nothing else. We will NEVER go back!!!"}
{"text":"Typical BBW. I've come here to watch the UFC mainly. Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. It's usually packed when I come so it loses a star, the second star is from the food quality to price. Besides that it's clean and I usually get seated in 10 or so minutes. I plan on coming back often."}
{"text":"We came up for UFC fight, looking for a new spot to watch. The place was so understaffed it was unreal. This is the worst BW3 I have been too. The manager Michael was so rude to employees all night (and customers). Needless to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings location is the best I have ever been to. I order my wings extra, extra, extra, extra crispy and they have always gotten it right. Their cheese curds are also the best I've ever had. Definitely better than the Savoy location."}
{"text":"The wings are great.  There is a wing sauce or many that will appeal to anyone. The Bar is well equiped for game night.  The Game night TV volume was way to loud and that comes from a person who likes loud music."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my girlfriend the food was really good and our server was really nice he was really cool and laid back and made us feel at ease overall I would rate my experience 5 stars based on the excellent service we got and how awesome our server was."}
{"text":"Great family and adult bar.The environment is overall very friendly open and smoke free. Any and every kind of sports event will be on one of  their 8 billion TVS. Crowd is diverse, from guys night out to family lunches and dinners. On Friday and Saturday nights, after 10, a younger crowd (under 30) frequents the bar, but nothing too crazy. Beer is decently priced, especially the tall boys, and the food is a little high, but very tasty! I have never had a bad time there."}
{"text":"Don't waste ur money. The nachos came with unmelted shredded cheese and the servers weren't really concerned about the experience of customers"}
{"text":"Took forever to get the food. Food wasn't very hot. They forgot my fries and charged me for them. I had to say something. Bathrooms were really dirty. Been to a few others in town and they seemed like they had things organized and cleaned better. Overall pricing seems to get higher and higher. Pretty soon I'm just going to stop coming to these places."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is hit or miss with service and overpriced for what you get. The service is sometimes ok, others it is miserable. We went back after it had re-opened in Surprise. The wings were absolutely delicious-- they were meaty, perfectly cooked with the right amount of sauce. Unfortunately, the next time we went in, the wings were very much like the BWW of old. Small wings, overdone and completely drenched in sauce. What makes it worse is the fact that, with the family-- there are fours of us-- it costs over $60(with tip-- provided the service is on par for a tip). And now I hear that BWW is reducing(??) its portion sizes but nor reducing the cost?!?!?   see this link for the new portioning:  http://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/controlling-costs/food-cost-outlook/articles/bww-adjusts-portioning-policy-reflect-wing-costs   and this link for the price increases: http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/28/investing/buffalo-wild-wings-earnings-higher-prices/"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit in about a months time. I used to frequent the North Durango location until I moved and haven't been back to. BWW's in about 4 years. The food has been good all 3 times. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. Our last visit they seemed to be playing music from the late 90's and we enjoyed that. Today we had Donald as our server and I seriously want to request him every time we dine there. He isn't annoying, he's efficient, friendly, funny and just a huge asset to your resturant. My husband and I will be regulars at this location and even drive out of our way because I'm not a fan of the Flamingo location."}
{"text":"Grret service and quick food delivery despite a full house. We sat at the bar and they were attentive despite being busy. The GM was engaged in running the floor. Good time."}
{"text":"Service is very poor. Our table was never given any attention for like 20 minutes. No water."}
{"text":"Where to begin? Have you ever ordered wings \"small, medium, large\" never. Who does that? It's 6,12, etc. how about the beers? Did you know they have a requirement of a huge head so you get less beer? If the head fizzles out they use a straw to \"fluff\" it up. Corporate policy. They have signs on the machines at the bar restricting those seats to players only. Too bad no one is playing and all seats are taken. Finally sat at a machine, put my money in and the machine doesn't work. Bartender told me to wait because sometimes they are slow?   What a joke. This place sucks. Haven't tried the carry out food yet. I would imagine I'll be equally disappointed."}
{"text":"This was an ok place to grab a quick lunch. Not sure we will ever be regulars. The wings were good, the service was great which was the only stand out part of the experience. There were two things that were a little annoying. One, the \"warm pita\" that comes with the hummus is actually deep fried, not just warmed up. It was greasy and crunchy like a chip. It would have been nice to know since people that eat hummus probably steer clear of most fried food. Also, the server talked my other half into getting a double in his mixed drink. When I watched the bartender make his drink she used the small side of the Jigger twice. They also put it in a giant glass so he paid extra, got one shot and his drink tasted like soda water."}
{"text":"This review is for a take out order.   My order was correct and all of the sauces I asked for were in the bag. They didn't give me wet wipes but that's okay! The fried mushrooms I ordered are sometimes hit or miss...this order was decent. The smaller mushrooms were delicious but the large mushrooms were mushy.   the potato wedges looked a little different and I was thinking it might be because the girl asked if I wanted only cheddar cheese on them. I've always just ordered potato wedges with cheese...never knew there was an option. So after seeing the color, I think maybe they mix two kinds of cheese normally. Either way, they were still good lol   This location is super convenient if you're on the strip. It's in the outlet mall shopping center."}
{"text":"Came here a few times. Always have slow service and little amount of food for the price. Would recommend other locations since wings are amazing overall."}
{"text":"Best service we've had in a very long time! We just left, had lunch at the bar and the server/bartender on shift was exceptional! Again, best service ever! Food was great and fast coming out! Drinks mixed to perfection!"}
{"text":"Bridgett!!! Bartender!!!  Bartendress  extraordinaire!!  Hmmm !  Bww exceeded my expectations for a chain.  Chains rarely do that.  The bartendress Bridgett was  Exceedingly: Personable, friendly, helpful, an efficient.  I was welcomed right away even though she was busy....it's the small things.  She was a 5 star bartender.   Sings were good.  Good size, flavor, doneness.  I had been curious about some other flavors.  Bridgett brought out some samplers of sing sauce.    I actually had to ask myself..,. Why not 5 Stars?  Little things.  Being acknowledged at the front door , no . Ranch sauce. 1-2 Stars.  Chefs, ranch is buttermilk, sour cream, chives, garlic, paprika.   The recipe for ranch is actually a long list.  I make it regularly.   If I can't taste chives, garlic, paprika, buttermilk, or sour cream.   Is it ranch?  Or mystery white sauce.   ( it was mystery white sauce) Fries good, very good.  Beer, nice and cold. ( colder would be nice In sweltering lvs)  Guys. Suggest your babe go to the nails place next door, have a beer/wings while you wait.  The bartender says single guys waiting for the wives to finish their nails are a frequent customer.   Join the smart, happy, beered up Guy group.  Take your wife to the nails place next door  and get a wings sweat/beer buzz on here."}
{"text":"Good, always busy.  Then again, I always go there on game nights.  Many TVs with various sports channels on at the same time.  Staff are not the most friendly, but they are fast and efficient.  Food is always hot, and the beer is always cold!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! I was kept waiting for over 40min for a simple number of 20 wings. I happened to be the only customer at the restaurant at the time as well. I should have took the emptiness into account and wondered why.... what's even worse is that they gave me only one favour when I asked for two..... Don't think I'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"I love the remodel! Food is great as always, can't wait to come back this Sunday. Staff is friendly and their are a ton of TVs. What more could a man ask for?"}
{"text":"Worst BWW I've ever been to.  Our waitress had a bad attitude and kept forgetting things on top of being snippy and rude.  She got our order wrong and then when the right order didn't come out after a long period of time, she blamed the manager.  The food was good but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Third time I came here since they first opened.  First time our waitress weren't too sure of what's going on but understandable since they just opened.  Their soft pretzels were awesome.  Wings were very good (smaller sized but apparently organic from their own farms) and their variety of flavours are great.  Second time was smooth with all orders.  This third, last time for me, was horrible.  Wings took a really long time to arrive even though there weren't many tables occupied, 1/5 of full capacity.  Pitchers of beer that we ordered came short every time.  There were a few waitresses standing around but our waiter seemed really busy and inattentive.  We had to waive him down a few times and when we asked for the bill we waited 20 mins and it didn't come so we had to go up to the bar to ask again.  It took another 15 mins for him to do it. Great food horrible service!"}
{"text":"DO: -take advantage of their $0.45 Tuesday Wing Deal! ...it's a great way to taste all their sauces without spending too much $. -order over the phone and call in 20 minutes before arriving... especially during meal times.  -be prepared... it gets busy, but service is fast.  DON'T: -crowd around the counter while waiting for wings.  It's confusing to people as to whom have paid and whom are simply waiting to pay.   -forget that Thursdays are $0.60 boneless chicken wings... but don't say I didn't tell ya... boneless wings aren't that great.   SERVICE: **** [Fast.] AMBIANCE: *** [Noisy, unless ordered to-go.] FOOD:  *** [decent tasting sauces, some wings can be over fried.] PRICE:  [St-deal!]  OVERALL: ***/* [3.5 rounded up to four!  ...cuz of their massive TVs, their Tuesday chix wings deal, and cuz it's OPEN 24 hours!]  Nuff said."}
{"text":"NEVER go to this place for lunch. It was extremely quiet, since apparently everyone but us knew that it was horrible. It is located near a hospital, numerous office parks and businesses... but was dead at lunch, for good reason. We ordered off the \"fast break\" menu helpfully placed at the table, but apparently this location \"doesn't do that.\" So we got cold food after an hour (advertised free after 15 mins), had to harass the waitress for our check, and summarily vowed never to set foot in a B-Dubs again. They should be grateful that I'm not suing them for false advertising."}
{"text":"I love the medium wings and the SALT and VINEGAR wings.  Excellent.  I also like their chili-cheese fries which you can still order despite no longer being on the menu.  Servers are usually good.  Speed of service is fine.  Careful when/if you bring your kids.  Some crowds can be raucous."}
{"text":"Definitely have experienced better.  So we found our way here after walking past a sign that we saw within Planet Hollywood. What a journey if you're coming from the Miracle Mile shops. Just keep following the arrows, you're almost there. :)  Anyhow, we were greeted and sat almost immediately. That's about where the timeliness started and stopped. Server #1 got to us and asked us what we wanted to drink. Cool. Time went by, and by... then server #2 came over and re-took our drink order and EVENTUALLY brought us our drinks. It was explained that Server #1 was clocking out so Server #2 would be taking care of us. I've worked in restaurants... I know about shift change. Cool, no big deal.   #2 was super polite and nice enough but the lack of being timely kind of killed the vibe for us. I think that we spent more time waiting than eating. The food quality was similar to any other Bdubs that you'd visit - nothing out of the norm to note here. Same insane amount of TVs with various games. Similar tap selections as the others I've visited.  If you want Bdubs that bad while on the strip, maybe your experience will be better than mine. But I would strongly suggest to just wait until you get back home to satisfy your craving OR venture off the strip to one of the neighborhood Bdubs until this one gets the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"Great server however this is not a review of service but quality and a warning. My family and I all visited the location and just returned from our Dr who said \"possible food born illness\" we including my 2yr old and 6yr old been sick since lastnight, throwing up and other things. I am sending this as a warning not interested in anything else.   My Dr did say we would be fine, however we will not return. The reviews I've read on this location, unfortunately after the fact reflect a pattern of this type of quality. Buffalo Wild Wings might want to research this diligently to prevent the Sevier illness or even worse of it's patrens."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really bright and super Cleveland sports friendly which I liked! Took a good 5 minutes for someone to even come to seat us when it wasn't even busy yet. Once we got seated we just wanted 2 coffees. Took a while to get them and when it came, the coffees were barely warm. Told our waitress and it took another 15 minutes to get fresh ones.  No joke. I get it. It's not a coffee house but we just wanted coffee and there was nowhere else close by open. Service was terrible. Waitress was nice but very forgetful and took forever to get anything. Asked for cream and sugar, coffee was getting cold again by the time we got it. I'd only recommend this place for the atmosphere and maybe some beers. That's about all it would be good for."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Seriously their wings are so amazing. The service is amazing and the prices are pretty good. I go here when I'm feeling like treating myself. This place seriously is so good :)"}
{"text":"The prime rib salad was salty and thin cuts of meat. Unlike other places that serve tri tip and the meats thick, this salad was not very good. The dressing was thick as not very tasteful, more like paste."}
{"text":"Trying it again. The music is tolerable tonight. Huge improvement with server...Gionni! She is on it tonight. The food is great! Loving the late night hours and atmosphere. Were sitting in a different section and I think that helps more.  $3 appetizers and shots. Great wings and Mango Habanero sauce, also loving the vibe. Happy about the improvements from last time. I give it a five stars. Let's retain this please... Thank you too the server Gionni! Until next time!!!"}
{"text":"This place is interesting... the service is god awful mostly because the staff is hanging out in a booth and not working. I watched one server do another's hair while their table waited for service. Some guy wearing a white captain jersey is too busy talking with the female wait staff instead of working. If I was the owner, I would not be very happy.   The food is fine and the place is ok. The bathrooms are disgusting and smell. Prices are expensive and overall average place."}
{"text":"Really annoyed. Sat with a large party but I was the only one who didn't get a drink, didn't help the fact I hadn't eaten anything all day so I had to grab an extra water from someone else.  I ordered a chocolate cake to come after my meal, but for some reason like 20 minute's after everyone was done I didn't get my cake.  We had to leave to the airport so didn't even have time to get he cake in a to go box.  Really bad service from the girl in red hair, not a fun time. I'm usually pretty lenient when it comes to restaurants given I worked in some myself but at the point where customers are getting neglected and I was literally about to pass out from lack of food or water WHILE inside of a restaurant, you really fail to meet even the bare minimum standards for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service very attentive and they always checked on my party of people to make sure we were okay and when we asked for refills they went that extra mile to make sure we got the refills and any other request as for the food at this location it was just as good as any buffalo wild wings location I've been too overall love this buffalo wild wings location and the fact that the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for nearly 8 years and tonight will be my last. I had a fly wing attached to my cup and the hospitality manager Christina was unapologetic and questioned where it came from and made it feel like it was our fault. When she approached us she was defensive and for some reason SHE seemed mad the whole time we spoke with her. She did not at first apologize or want to offer us any accommodation and we could see her talking about us to two waiters as we left. So very unprofessional.."}
{"text":"We were sat at 6:45 and our server came to our table after 7 conveniently happy hour ends at 7. She was all too happy to inform us that happy hour ends at 7 and the clocks on the inside are fast....ummmm excuse me??? The inside of the restaurant is in another dimension where time is irrelevant and does not work the same way as outside the restaurant? Pretty sure my superior Apple product has the correct time. Then when we finally convinced Her after much deliberation and throwing ourselves at the mercy of the Buffalo Wild Wings court she \"made an exception\" and gave us a round at happy hour prices. I ordered a corona light which she informed me isn't part of their happy hour menu...which I believe she was so excited to share the news with me, what a nice daggers eyes!!!  I ordered the transitional wing combo and was informed that that does not come only boneless it only comes half and half. She was just a barrel of bad news all night. I'm ok with policies and procedures I work in finance, policies and procedures make the world go round. But I'm a paying customer...worse yet a tipping customer!! At least be empathetic to my situation and tell me you wish there was something you could do.....ask a manager I don't care what you do just pretend to care. The night ended up a battle between me and our waitress! I didn't get off work to come oh to eat to enter a snark battle!!"}
{"text":"Very crowded. A new restaurant in Monroe and the place is crazy crowded. The wings are fine. The waiter seemed dis interested and got a few of our things wrong. One of our party complained and the manager gave a credit. That was nice but they should have done it without the complaint."}
{"text":"Absolutely no one else here for a Monday night dinner.  The food was in line with other BW3's so you will get what you expect.  Maybe the experience is better on a weekend, but Monday evening was just not great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service! Me and my husband like to go here on a Friday night just to hang out and have a drink!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with the family and went with the wings and a salad.  My son had the combo bone-in and boneless wings with the Mango Habanero hot sauce and I had the traditional wings with Parmesan Garlic sauce. His hot sauce was way too hot for me but the Parmesan Garlic was just right for taste and heat. The wings were done well as you'd expect given the name on the establishment. My wife had the Chicken Chopped Salad and thought it was just okay.  It is a typical sports bar atmosphere with multiple TVs around an open room. The noise level is relatively high as you might expect but it's a friendly place and the waitstaff is helpful. It's a place to go for decent eats at good prices and get your fill of sports."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, mostly because it's close to my house but I like it.  The atmosphere is a little loud but if you are into 85 TV's displaying 40 different sports programs it's all good.  What brings me back ... their mojito's ... love 'em."}
{"text":"A little disappointed on the Arby's buy out. Wings are still good, service is great. The problem I have is I ordered a side of fries and the portion was horrible, no value. You have to ask for the wet naps. They are \"By request only\". They have definitely gone cheap. BWW be careful, you guys are losing customers with your cheap and cost effective decisions. What looks good on paper may not be the best business practices to retain customers Oh and don't get me started on the portion of carrots and celery the bring... Pathetic"}
{"text":"So, it's almost certain that you've already been to a Buffalo Wild Wings, a corporate sports bar chain that I once worked for back in its humble beginnings as an Ohio State dive in Columbus, OH. The wing sauces are actually quite good, easily the best among the big chains, and so hunger and nostalgia drove me to see how they were doing at the U. of Wisconsin location.  How they are doing is grossly and ickily corporatized: servers are reading from  a creepy, memorized, cocktails-to-dessert training script that precludes them from resembling humans in any substantive way. Prices have so outpaced inflation that it now costs $18 to get your fill of their food, without drinks or tip. I get that costs have gone up on everything since 1995, but not 300% in most instances. They've also shrunk their wing portion size from six and twelve to five and ten. $10.79 for ten measly wings? Really? Yes, the wing sauces are still good (and the limited-run Moroccan Fire was tasty), but paying for their advertising budget now means that you're forking over real-food money for deep-fried items only a slight grade above fast food. In a word, meh."}
{"text":"The service is pathetic. We were sitting for around an hour before the food came. Ridiculously bad service."}
{"text":"Stopped by after the Coyotes game. Good atmosphere. Great night to sit outside. But.....the service was slow. Or, I should say our server did not come around very often. I had asked for a tv to be changed to a football game, it never happened. There was one gal (wearing a white BWW shirt), called \"Captain\", she stayed at the same table the whole time we were there. She was loud and obnoxious. I later found out the \"Captains\" are supposed to walk around to other tables.   We ordered one of the sampler platters (the one with the pretzels). It was a nice snack for after the game.  I wanted extra cheese sauce, but as mentioned above, our server never came around. I will try this place again. I hope the service will be better next time so I can give it another star."}
{"text":"WIld wings are good, great  atmosphere for afterhour hang out. Good selection of beer and great wings as well."}
{"text":"Went here to have a day out with my son's. After we were seated it took them over 20 minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink. I asked for the manager to explain the situation to him. He basically told me there is nothing he could do about that. So I took my business elsewhere. Not to mention I had to pay $6 for parking for service I never even got. I don't plan on bringing my business back there"}
{"text":"Pretty busy during lunch time, but they have a 15 minute guarantee for your food to come out or it's free. The lunch combos are a decent selection ranging from $6-9 (entrée & side). The chicken salad entrée is pretty unimpressive with a few tiny cubes of chicken but it was expected with the price point. The buffalo chips as my side were decent except I asked for buffalo seasoning and didn't receive it. The meal at this point was 3 stars, they lost another star after a water cup was spilled onto my hair and back and all over my chair. The server was apologetic, as were management but that's all. I didn't make a huge deal of it although I did have to return to work with a wet back and wet hair... but I did expect some sort of discount off the check? No discount just an apology."}
{"text":"Service was horrible,  we ordered beers that never came, we had to ask for the celery with the wings, then the manager lied about what she took off the bill for compensation for forgetting the beers...wth..."}
{"text":"Great BW3 in general. Much better than the food from the one in Avon. They actually put enough sauce on my pulled pork sandwich, which was delicious. Hit up this Bdubs if your ichin' for some good bar food."}
{"text":"Came into B-Dubs for dinner and I stopped counting at 48 TV,s it was very loud. The wings were very meaty, we got 2 dry rubs salt and vinegar and buffalo they were good, service was spot on.You must try the cheese cake bites with caramel and chocolate dipping sauce, I'm not a big dessert fan but I would come back just for them."}
{"text":"I live for their 75 cent boneless Thursdays.   I've only ever come on a Thursday to either dine in or take out and all my experiences have been nothing short of terrific. Either I've lucked out on the service everytime, or everyone else has had the misfortune of an off service day. I think the latter is more likely..   The atmosphere is typical of a sports pub with TVs everywhere. It's quite spacious and lively inside as well (depending on the day).  They have quite a few sauces to choose from, although I tend to lean towards the dry rubs and it's hard to go wrong there. The chipotle bbq is my favourite. Smokey, sweet and just a bit of heat. For the saucier side, the classic honey garlic is great and the parmesan garlic is great as well (it does get salty after awhile, but what can you expect)  I'd say 30ish of the boneless is good for a group of 4, assuming everyone is not extremely starved. You can't go wrong with the price for that deal ($20-30 I believe).  Anyways, this place is definitely worth a try for the boneless special and I think they deserve a chance before you let any reviews deter you.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This place has consistently let me and my co-workers down during lunch hours. We would be one out of five tables there in the whole building and our service was bad, food was cold, wings not sauced enough, and they would also manage to screw up the check. This happened the past three times. I used to love this franchise, now I don't even think twice about going."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to to dine in on a game night and it was super slow but received great service! Our server didn't mention her name but I forgot the name on the receipt but she had blue hair and glasses she was pretty nice! No complaints (:"}
{"text":"I personally like this place for many reasons, and I'm speaking for all locations.  Food is good and reasonable priced, service can be inconsistent but its never been bad!  There are TV's everywhere so if you there for a game or just for dinner there is always something on to watch.  They have cool game consoles for trivia games to play if your bored, and last time I was there I saw some kids consoles that looked fun to keep kids attention for awhile.  Overall I always know what I'm getting when I go to a BWW!!!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible, bar tender was slow, no silver ware and the boneless wings were I expected cold. Waste of a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"The service here was subpar extremely unfriendly while we waited to be seated. After we had our orders taken the manager then proceeded to vacuum the dining area while we were eating our \"shareables\" and waiting for  food for an extremely long time period. Our server then ran off to take a smoke break right after our food was delivered but felt the need to tell us she was going on break to smoke. Also while eating made many mistakes with our groups orders and drink refills."}
{"text":"Beer selection is good but the food sucks so bad. And how can a place called Buffalo Wild Wings consistently have the worst wings I've ever eaten? Soggy, meat tastes weird, sauces gross. On a positive note, I had really good service by the server and the bartender."}
{"text":"This is a great location for a Bdubs, and I loved the service I got there. The server was quick and friendly! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Thank you Laci for being wonderful. She took care of us really good didn't rush my boyfriend and I, checked in on us often. She's so sweet. Thank you Laci great customer service."}
{"text":"We had an order of naked wings & an order of naked with lemon pepper with the Asian Zing, Buffalo and honey barbeque sauces! I had the Asian Zing and Buffalo. They were both Delicious! Also, I had a Killian's Red! I haven't had one of those in about 10 years! Good times! My fiancé and I had a blast playing games against each other on the tablets. Only scoring down due to the service. They took quite a long time to bring our food and didn't check back with us as timely as they should have. We'll be back! I mean who can resist good wings and beer!"}
{"text":"I would go here again. Food was NOT good at all. Noisy. The staff was nice, but hard to find our waitress, who was busy.  I was disappointed to say the least.  Wanted to sit on the patio for a quieter dinner, but was smoking was allowed there."}
{"text":"Ok, so we were in the mood for wings, so where do we go to get wings? Buffalo Wild Wings!!!!! But they won't last long in your system.... Within an hours we were \"expressing ourselves\" to the toilets at the nearest place. The food was tasty going down but can't say the same while exiting..... Sorry to be graphic but we have to let you all know!!!!  Ok Since my last writing this 49 min ago, I have been back to visit my \"thrown\" three times..... Folks I am saying this honestly..... NOT GOOD!"}
{"text":"Worst bleu cheese ever, ranch was runny and wings were fatty and shame on me for trying crimson citrus sauce, horrible limited time option.   Loud inside, still to cold for outside dining.   To be known as a wing spot, they messed up.  Server was friendly and attentive, food was awful.  Do you have to ask for celery?"}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever experienced!!!! I called in an order for pickup and was told it would be ready in an hour and a half. When I arrived 90 minutes later to pickup my food, there was a long line. I waited in line for 20 minutes before I got to the counter. When I gave the young lady my name (almost 2 hours since I have ordered my food), the young lady unapologetically tells me my order won't be ready for another hour. I told her this is unacceptable and extremely bad service, and that's  when she finally apologized and said there is nothing she can do...They are backed up. A manager could not be found and no compensation was provided for not having my order ready as promised or for making me wait 20 minutes to find out my order was not going to be ready. Horrible!!!! I ended up cancelling my order. I will never go there again!"}
{"text":"PROS: -lively atmosphere -$0.49 wings on Tuesdays -free refills -great tasting wings  CONS: -service can be slow when they're busy, our waiter ignored us several times when she walked right by us  not a lot of cons for this place to be honest, I am a fan of this place now. But since I'm trying to choose healthier places to eat and eating home cooked meals, you won't see me here every week. But I highly recommend trying out this place, particularly when it's not during lunch or dinner rush so that your service is quicker and your waiter will be more attentive."}
{"text":"Best service I've ever gotten! We went for a UFC event and had a great experience. Raven was awesome and made sure we had everything we needed. She is super friendly and on top of everything! Defiantly will be returning."}
{"text":"BWW gets 4 stars for a few simple reasons.  The service was good the two times I have been there. Once for take out and the second time for dine in.  It is hard to have high expectations for a low- end eatery but for what they are I think they did a pretty good job."}
{"text":"Absolute torture as I sat with the GF killing time tying to watch the Charger game.  It seemed this place supports San Francisco and New England.  I am not a BWW's fan and it is totally my fault that I haven't consumed the garlic parmesan flavored cool aid and totally gotten onboard with this place or any of it's other locations.  With that said it did consume some bland cheese covered potatoes and then ate some mango habanero boneless wings.  My drink of choice for the meal was a red stag flavored coke.  It ended up being way to sweet for my taste.  The service though slow was blessed with a sweetheart server that dropped in from time to time.  This just is not my cup of ranch..."}
{"text":"Ok so there food was good but our service sucked hot wings and no drinks  doesn't make for a fun evening. No napkins and we waited forever just to order and no one was even there. Im kinda gross out just a little by the oversized wings!!!! But they have killer sauces"}
{"text":"Came by for lunch with our department. The server was trying really hard to keep up with everyone's order and made an effort to bring our orders out quickly but considering there was maybe 25 of us, she was fantastic.   The quality of the wings were very... basic? Average sized wings with mediocre sauce. The wings itself were nicely fried/battered but it's nothing to brag about. What was disappointing was the sauce. I ordered a basket of parmesan garlic wings and the sauce was almost non-existing. I also got their spiciest hot sauce on the side and it was super under-whelming. I was expecting an actual spicy sauce but meh.   Can't call yourself a wing joint when the wings are seriously lacking. I only return because they can accommodate to our department."}
{"text":"0 stars if I could. I never give a negative review but the managers here need to come hard on these little hosts/waiters. We come in right after the brothers graduation to celebrate and aren't even greeted while a bunch of the employees stood there chatting (and a girl looking me up/down) until finally it got weird and one with a beard said hi and asked how many of us there were, then told us to find a table. Didn't even guide us there party of 6. So we sit at the closest table to them and continue sitting for a good 10minutes not ONE EMPLOYEE came to our table. After these 10 minutes of awkwardly sitting waiting for someone, ANYONE to come to us, we decide to get up and get out of there. Now we're on the way to BWW in Goodyear"}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed.  The service was horrible.  Appetizers were ordered but not delivered until just a few minutes before the meals arrived.  The waitress wasn't very friendly at all.  I got my ribs and they were cold.  I won't be going back after this experience."}
{"text":"Poor performance in my opinion on (3-7-17 9p.m. the only highlight was the server brendon great guy, checked on me multiple times ! No host when I walked in ! I walked from the front door to the bar and back to the front door passing my lay eyes 10 employees and no one greeted me!  Food was worse I ordered 10 wings half BBQ half mild the BBQ wings were fresh but the mild wings were re- dipped in the geese to crisp up an old wing, and then drowned in sauce! Only reason I could tell is because I'm a restaurant manager myself and a chef! My wings were two different temperatures!"}
{"text":"I should start out by saying that chicken wings are my favorite good, and bww is my favorite place to eat, but the service at this location is awful. They always mess up at least one thing, takeout is slow and since something is always wrong-your good ends up cold! The servers inside are just as bad! It took 15 minutes after being seated to just get our drink order taken! Plus, don't get me started on their ridiculous ranch and carrot policies. I'm sorry, but for 18 boneless wings-on a regular night-not boneless night, I should not have to pay for ranch and carrots! They need to get a grip on their customer service. I think some mystery diners or undercover boss help would wake the management of tips location up!"}
{"text":"If you want AMAZING service M-Th at the bar go see Erica!!! She is AMAZING! Best bartender ever. I've gone there before and had a few bad experiences, but Erica apologized for past experiences and made this experience GREAT! She is funny and very personable. She really cares about her customers and makes you want to return. CJ the GM at BWWs is also great. He acknowledged Erica's great service and was very personable as well."}
{"text":"Very upset with the service there tonight. We had Gabriella serve myself and 7 others. Big group right? Cut her slack right? 1. Took 40 minutes for a cold plate of nachos that tasted like Taco Bell to come after asking 3 seperate times where they were 2. Asked for a jug of water because we would be drinking a lot..no jug brought and had to practically beg for refills 3. Awkwardly asked me to collect the menus from my group when she finished taking their order 4. Food wasn't great..we all got wings and fries and mine were mediocre for a wing joint 5. Apparently came once to ask if everything was ok (after we finished eating) and didn't stay long enough for a response. 6. Tried to get our bills and waited 20 minutes for her and I began waving my hand to try and get her attention. I ended up following her to the bar on the other side of the resturaunt and asked for our bills. 7. I didn't tip. Our food was poor and the service was horrible. I am usually a solid 15% tipper, 20 when it's good. They should have paid me for wasting my time. 8. After my group had paid she said in a rude tone \"thank-you for those who tipped and for those who didn't have a Merry Christmas\" and quickly walked away. I had had enough by that point and said loudly if the service was better we would have. 9. I have all the respect in the world for servers. They do a job that requires a lot of hard work. And 8 people is a challenge. But a gratuity is extra. It's going above and beyond the bare minimum. Servers, please don't mistake tip as a right. It has to be earned through good service, food, and definitely not insulting a customer in front of their face. 10. We spoke after this incident with a manager. She apologized a bunch of times, but I doubt anything was done.   TL: DR. Disgusting service. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Among my BF's circle of friends, BWW is an institution. So as expected, we made a special trip just for my buffalo-wing-loving honey.  Our service experience here was 5 STARS. We were seated immediately in a crowded, lively environment and our order was taken shortly thereafter. He ordered 25 wings with the Mango Habenero, Garlic & Honey BBQ, & the Blazin' Wings (super hot). I don't eat yard bird myself, so I ordered the fish and chips and the mozzarella sticks.  The waiter came back a few minutes later with our full order and profuse apologies about the mozzarella sticks not coming out sooner -- as a result, they wanted to comp them for us (this showed up as \"food goof\" on our bill. Cute). Which was very nice, considering we weren't paying attention either way. I asked for some extra lemon and sugar for my iced tea and our waiter blinked it right over, a la \"I Dream of Jeannie.\" Then the manager came by a few moments later to just to make sure we were happy with our meal. Very attentive service, I was duly impressed. Or maybe they just thought I worked at the Spearmint Rhino or something.  The fish and chips were average but all I really did was drag my fries over his sauces to taste them (and they were quite yummy).  The wings. My bf was in a zone eating those things.  I knew better than to interrupt his culinary reverie, but I'm a woman, which means I'm entitled to put my man through random bouts of Spanish Inquisition-style hypothetical and circular questioning to which there are no right answers.   Me: \"So baaaaaby [stroking his arm]....what would you choose if you could only choose ONE - a plate of those wings or a blowjob?\"  BF (with sauce on mouth):  \"um....[finishes swallowing a chicken chunk]... well, why can't I have both?\"  me: \"Because you CAN'T, you're stranded on a deserted island and you can only take my blowjobs or those chicken wings with you. Which one?\"  BF: \"\"Would it be a finite amount of blowjobs or chicken wings, or would I have either indefinitely?\"  me: \"Indefinitely.\"  BF: \"Well...without the wings, I wouldn't have any food, and I'd starve....\"  me: [eyebrow raised]  BF (very quickly): \"But I couldn't live without you anyway... I'd survive on coconuts and learn how to spear fish. Your blowjobs, for sure. [toothy grin] \"  me: [leans over to kiss him]  Alas, I could see the truth in his eyes. There you have it: my BF would choose a plate of BWW over a blowjob. Wings. Wings of a dead bird. Wings of a dead bird that didn't even work as wings when the dead bird was an alive bird. If that doesn't speak about how good those things are, I don't know what does.  Either that, or I need to work on my technique."}
{"text":"We love buffalo wild wings, the name and chain is the reason this location gets the one star.  This location is absolutely disgusting!  The menu's are filthy, greasy, full of pieces of food and sticky.  The outside makes the place seem as if it were abandoned- is gross! The pavement dirty and stained. Boxes scattered by entrance and signs missing/broken.  The host also seemed so sarcastic.  So sad we have experienced this-"}
{"text":"Happy hour menu reduced along with happy hour beer prices increasing in a few days. Food is good most of the time. Some items overpriced. Better deals at other resturants/bars. I will spend less money in here due to price increases. Supposed to be a sports bar, music played during games on occasion. 99% of staff are great. Compared to other Buffalo Wild Wings that I have been to across the country, this one is well below those. I have been told the reason is because it's a Corporate Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"First, I am NOT a fan of their boneless wings.   I hate it when restaurants dip a chicken nugget in sauce and call it a boneless wing.  I can't stand that they don't even give you a little plate and that celery and blue cheese is extra and you have to ask for it.    But, I want to review this location for the people that do like their food.  This is relatively large, it has a great fireplace separating the bar from the dining area, and has projection screens everywhere.    Our service was great and we didn't have to wait long for our [gross] food.  It's like any other BWW's, but without the big divide between dining and bar.  I'm sure it could get noisy if there's some good game on."}
{"text":"Great, polite, and quick service. Make sure to ask for Grif - he brought us our food quickly and correctly, was polite, and made sure we were satisfied. I also recommend going with boned wings as they have more flavor than boneless"}
{"text":"We come here often because he loves this place, but tonight, I was reminded why we pick this exact location pretty much every time. Danielle  (aka Jennifer Aniston) was our server, and made for such awesome night. She is personable, funny, knowledgeable, and quick on her feet. All things you ask for in a server. She had the most personality out of everyone I encountered on the floor, and even made me miss my waiting tables days. You're lucky if you get put in her section! She'll make you laugh, then make sure you leave full.   Great job Danielle!!!"}
{"text":"Six of us went to this location yesterday.  Place was warm and humid feeling.  Server was slow in coming to the table to take the order.  We mentioned about the uncomfortable air and she acknowledged that it was too warm.  She said she had worn a long sleeve shirt and was not comfortable either.  She said she would check into having the air conditioner turned on.  We also asked for individual checks.  She didn't seem happy about this.  Our order took an unusually long time.  Four folks had some variety of wings.  Two had burgers.  Not a complicated or unusually large order.  Server also did not check with the table after the food was delivered.  Two times we had to call her to the table for something that we needed.  As we were finishing our meal, the manager or assistant manager (an Hispanic gentleman) walked by and one of the folks mentioned that it was uncomfortable.  He said he had turned the fans on high.  We said it didn't help, it only blew the warm air down on us.  He said he would turn on the air conditioning.  This he did about 5 minutes before we left.  When the server brought the checks, she just dropped two of them on the table and said she didn't know who they belonged to.  Really?  She had one job.  She failed.  Food wasn't anything special. Typical wing joint food.  I've had better.  Wouldn't go back to this location.  Not a pleasant experience.  Perhaps if the service had been better and they had paid attention to the needs of their customers, it might have been a better experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, had my son with me so he absolutely loved this place t.v's all over playing non-stop sports.  the variety of wings is great and the prices are pretty good as well.  This was really just a fun spot to hang out and eat wings."}
{"text":"Me and boyfriend have been coming here at least once a week for the past month , and he always plays poker when we come so we sit at the bar obviously , today we came in and he put his money in as we waited longer than usual for the bartender (not our usual one ) he finally came and once we tried ordering our drinks he walked away then came back without our menus , we ordered our drinks and the menus did not come after our drinks came he gave us the menus , finally after about 15min of us waiting he tells us to move because we were not playing the machine quick enough ? Not to mention his attitude was far worst than ever , we still had money in the machine and he was being a complete jerk !has he ever heard of customer service ? I think not . I get that you have to play the machine and those are the rules to sitting at the bar , but hey let's try this thing called being polite ya jerk ,after we were forced to move no one sat where we were sitting guess the demand was pretty high to sit there ? On a lighter note out server Wes was a doll and the food was great as usual  , and To the bartender named Brian my tip to you is be kind when has rudeness ever paid off ?"}
{"text":"Service last time was just ok ! Not really engaging in any way and the hostess never even talked to us !! Food is always pretty good and we like hanging out !!"}
{"text":"We frequently go here and always have a good experience! This time was no different other than most the tables were dirty !! But it was expected as it was right during Christmas and they were very busy !!   The service was great . We came in during shift change and everyone was still able to take care of us !!"}
{"text":"We are regulars at this BWW and frequent at least once a month !! The beers are cold and the food was good ! Loved that they remodeled having open sight lines through out !! The high top chairs are super hard but understandable for a bar !! Waitress was nice !!"}
{"text":"We eat here several times a week. The food is good for s chain place, and we like the service. We know many of the servers since we are here so often! It's just a great, casual place to go sit, eat, talk and watch any games that are on. The prices aren't bad either!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about Buffalo Wild Wings. Sure, the food is decent... but the reason for this one star is mainly because of the service!  Waited around 45 minutes for my order with a couple of friends while watching the game. One of the most annoying things is watching people who were clearly seated after you, get served first and also receive their food a lot faster. Waters came fast but the beers not so fast.  My friends and I only ordered some wings and 2 appetizers, so I imagine that the food preparation shouldn't take THAT long."}
{"text":"Was happy to hear BWW re-opened at this location in Glendale.  We met several friends there to watch a football game and enjoy some food.  It was ok.  The service was slow, had to keep asking people for refills, food was average.    We/ve always like the wings at BWW so those were good, I tried fried pickles for the first time and enjoyed them.  They brought the wrong order for 3 people in our party of 7.  Waitress gave my hubby a beer, he took a sip from it and told her it wasn't Blue Moon (like he ordered).  She said \"Oh, it's a Michelob Utra!\" They proceeded to ask a couple of other waitresses nearby if they were waiting on an Ultra.  She went to hand the beer to another waitress (to give to another patron).  I practically jumped out of my seat and stopped her...I told her AGAIN, my husband took a sip of it and realized it wasn't Blue Moon...you can't give it to that person!  She gave me a glare and told my husband he shouldn't have sipped from it if he didn't plan on drinking it.    I told her that she brought him the WRONG BEER....I told manager on duty what happened, between the beer, waitress trying to give to another patron after sip was taken, orders messed up with 3 at our table, etc.  We were not happy with this visit AT ALL."}
{"text":"Nice service. Our waitress was super nice and patient. The beers were good. We ordered the sampler with the onion rings, cheese sticks, nachos, and boneless honey BBQ chicken.  Everything was ice cold. (We waited over 40 minutes for it, but it was very busy)  The nachos had some lettuce, chili and jalapenos on it. (\"some\" is putting lightly)  The \"boneless\" chicken was so over cooked, there was no edible chicken left. The cheese sticks and onion rings were good.  The positives were that we were able to watch the hockey game with sound. That was the important thing.  Just don't order their food and you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"I've had better experiences at other bwws. I called in for my order with Jamie and she can barely hear me. I had my brother pick up and he came home without my drink. It was not his fault but they should not be making careless mistakes like this. They should confirm and check if everything on the receipt is given. Also on the receipt, she had my phone number entirely wrong lol! get a better take out employee or a better phone line. I would not care if the drink was a dollar or something but the pepsi I ordered was close to $3.00 which comes to my next point, bww's prices are way overpriced for mediocre food. Don't think I would stop at bww for quite some time. Wing stop is going to be go to for wings for now."}
{"text":"Made a  take out order on swing and the bartender didn't tell grave about it. Ended up eaiting 45 mins for wings and wedges. Will not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"You have to understand, I have this love/hate relationship with my stomach. I have a masochistic addiction to terrible, terrible food. And BWWs is the culinary dominatrix of my dreams.  Buffalo Wild Wings will punish you. The queso dip will dominate your GI tract. The hot sauces will humiliate your palate. The potato wedges will whip your insides to a frenzy (ok, that one was a stretch - you try keeping an S&M food analogy going more than three lines).  Oh BWWs, I kneel in supplication. Your hot wings deliver, your popcorn shrimp are awful/wonderful, and I dream about your queso dip when I'm away. I even love your pathetic attempt at nachos. Oh I know the pain will come, but I'll take it. You're cheap and dirty, just how I like it."}
{"text":"I have been twice now.  Both times I went in looking for good wings.  Both times I walked out disappointed.   I had the boneless both times.  The chicken is lost in the heavy breading.  Very dry.   I do like their options for various flavors.  The Mango Habanero is excellent.  Also like that they offer a dry season.   But if I am looking for good wings or boneless in this case, there are some other places I will look first.   Great for football viewing.  Also they offer UFC fights.  Also nice selections of beer."}
{"text":"I've never done a bad review on a place but this was the worst Buffalo Wild Wings that I've ever been to. I went in on a Thursday for the boneless wing special only to find out that they do not let you order specific amounts of wings. You have to get the sizes listed on the menu. Any other Buffalo Wild Wings I've been to let's you get as many wings as you want, even if it's 4. After I decided I would get the 8, because that's the smallest size on the menu(which is too many for me to eat) I was then told that I couldn't get two sauces on my wings because the general manager took the buttons out of the computer. Any other time I've gotten wings at a Buffalo Wild Wings I've been able to do multiple sauces. Also I went in on a day that Buffalo Wild Wings was running a promotion for $5 margaritas and $4 street tacos. They were offering the tacos but not the margaritas, which makes absolutely no sense. If you're offering one why wouldn't you offer the other. I've worked in a restaurant for the past 8 years and I never complain. The server was very nice but wasn't very helpful in accommodating what I was asking for. Apparently this is a franchised restaurant so they don't have the happy hour appetizers either. It seems to me like they offer the very bare minimum to their guests and don't actually care about satisfying them at all. That's a sure way to make sure that people never return and a good way to fail as a business. The only good thing about this place is that the food was very hot and fresh. I can say that I will NEVER return to this location. I'd rather drive an hour then to eat at such a generic Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"I have eaten at BW3 in a few states and I like the bar atmosphere and the great wings.  My favorite sauce is the Asian Zing.  It can be packed so unless you want to be crushed by sports fans, don't go on a big game day.  Oh and there is one disgusting thing on the menu, I think its called Southwest poppers, totally barfable, not even the staff will eat them."}
{"text":"For quite a few years, before we relocated out of the area, this Buffalo Wild Wings was our hangout spot of choice. We never recieved anything but world class service, the food was always top notch and the atmosphere as a whole was awesome. This was like Cheers to us, everyone knew our name and were always glad we came. I recently returned to the area for a weekend, and was quite broken hearted to see our old hangout spot, one which brought us so many great memories had closed it's doors forever. I won't forget the good times I've had at BWW on Grove Avenue. This place truly started my affair with Buffalo Wild Wings as our restaurant of choosing."}
{"text":"First discovered Buffalo Wild Wings in 2006, and became a regular visitor to the location across from the Fiesta Mall for the next three years. It truly became my version of Cheers, as everyone in the restaurant knew me on a first name basis, always knew what I was ordering, and knew what booth to seat me in before I even walked in the door. Absolutely loved it. Unfortunately, work took my family and I away from the area for a few years. While my family and I managed to find other Buffalo Wild Wings where we briefly lived, it never was quite like the one in Mesa, which felt like our home away from home. Sadly when we moved back here, we found out our Buffalo Wild Wings had closed and gone out of business.  We tried out the others and they too were good but again, that Cheers feel was missing. Then, almost on accident, we found the Tempe Buffalo Wild Wings and it had the same exact feel the Mesa one had. As soon as I walked in the door for the first time, we were greeted by a manager who wanted to know our name and began a \"get to know you\" conversation that seemed more than just contrived \"pay me and get out\" banter. The other workers as I've returned have been the same, and now they know us on the same personal level the Alma School workers did. The convenient location atop of the quality service I receive everytime I walk in the door make this my restaurant of choice. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time ever for a quick lunch before work. Hostess was very pleasant asked if we wanted the bar or table so we chose the bar for quicker service. On my way to the restroom two servers were blocking the walkway, said excuse me politely and one of the servers rudely told me to wait a second, I guess stepping to the side while playing on her phone was a difficult task.  When I ordered my food by a very polite and friendly bartender I adamantly told him to please make sure it was very crispy didn't care if they burned it. Well....it didn't come out raw.  All in all the food was good and thanks to the friendly bartender my experience was good and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The service was atrocious. Had tomatoes in my coke, the food was shit at best and that's an insult to shit. It really ruffles my feathers that people could be so dumb. In the wise words of Gordon Ramsey, Where's the Lamb Sauce?"}
{"text":"Tuesday nights are the busiest but the best night to come here as it is .45 cent wings night. Try their dry rub style wings and one of my favorites is the Salt and Vinegar and for wet style the Asian Zing. Mango Habanero is good too if you can stand the heat. the servers are great for the most part but prepare to wait on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"I finally gave this location one more try. In short, we won't be back! We ordered appetizers, wings, and a kid's meal. Tried to keep it simple. My husband ordered a beer, took the bartender 20 minutes to bring his beer out. I watched her sloppily walk the beer to the table; no tray, beer spilling everywhere. She wasn't in a hurry, they were not busy. By the time the glass made it to our table, it went from being a full perfectly poured beer to losing 3 inches from the top, messy and sticky. So sloppy and careless.   Sat for 35 minutes after we ordered our food, didn't hear from our server. I honestly thought they had forgotten about us. Manager finally brings our food out, apologizes that it took so long. She said they ran out of chicken (for the nachos,) so they had to \"make it fresh.\" The other dishes were cold and crusty...all of it had obviously been sitting back there for a long time. I literally scraped the crusted cheese coating off of some cheese dip. Gross. The manager asked us how everything looked, my husband (very nicely) told her this is our second visit to this location and we won't be back. She tried to give us coupons for our next visit, we declined. Definitely will be finding another BWW location to frequent."}
{"text":"After heading to the Hualapai (which claima to be opened 24/7), I came here. I amCompletely disappointed by my visit here I came here at 2:50AM. I waited to be attended for almost 20 minutes. The service here is terrible. Will go to wing stop from now on."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience in this place yet.  We just need a Buffalo Wild Wings in the South Hills!"}
{"text":"Just like any other B Dubbs location this one is fun for friendly get together to have some beers or any other drinks and some amazing wings.  Happy hour specials from 3p-7p and 10p-6a from Absolut specials to Jack Daniels. Of course we all know about the Tuesday and Thursday wing specials I'm sure we all take advantage.  The staff is very friendly and if you go there often they'll definitely remember your order down to the T on every visit lol. The only problem is that everybody and their mama go to this location so you're bound to run into anybody you may be avoiding lol."}
{"text":"What can I say?... BDubs is the best wings spot ever! Great employee staff, relaxed environment, awesome happy hour, and great deals on Tuesday and Thursday! I suggest grabbing some Asian Zing and Mango Habernaro wings and cold brew. It'll make your night that much better."}
{"text":"The employees here walk with a chip on their shoulder like they hate their jobs. My to go orders have issues 40% of the time. When I dine there they seem to have a little attitude. I really enjoy bww's food just not the crazy attitude teens that work here."}
{"text":"Decent place to watch a game - literally any game. The waitresses are nice and will turn pretty much any TV on the game you want. Seats are kind of uncomfortable after sitting 3+ hours. Lots of beer and cider options on tap. The cedar location is much mode convenient and updated compared to the one in lyndhurst."}
{"text":"Just left location. We walked in and the host signed us in. Our party consisted of 5 people and the host proceeded to tell us that it will be \"a bit of a wait.\" After about 15 minutes in another person walks in asking for a table for 4 adults and two children. The host tells him that they will be seated immediately. Of course this starts to make my blood boil. I believe he when our to tell the rest of his party and I stood up to question about the wait time. The host seemed confused and apparently she misspelled my name. She tells me it would be a 25 minute wait. Lol. I think another girl saw my facial expression and told me they will seat us right away. We are taken to the table that to top it off is by the bathrooms. I asked for the manager and explained to him why we were leaving. He didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"When I don't know what to eat, I ask myself if it's Tuesday. No? Think of a place to eat. Yes? GO TO BUFFALO WILD WINGS  People here think my friends and I are crazy because it is not uncommon for us to order well over 100 wings to share.  I absolutely love their parmesan garlic sauce on traditional wings. Desert heat, honey bbq, and chipotle bbq are all solid choices as well. The servers are very friendly and attentive. I've come here with small and large parties and have usually gotten great service.  It may just be me, but I HATE their boneless wings, which is what is holding back the last star. They are overly breaded, dry, and have very little sauce on them. I honestly only come here on Tuesdays for their traditional special."}
{"text":"Lunch convo: \"Imagine how many chickens have to die each year for Sunday football wings.  Who thought of the idea of wings dipped in ranch sauce? Why is it called buffalo wings?  Why can't they play real football on TV?\"  #GodBlessAmerica #Gluttons"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good at this BWW's, I usually sit at the bar and the service has been excellent especially when Melissa is working."}
{"text":"Food is always great here, but I just had my worst experiense here on my bday that I got out and just left. First, I called if they have happy hour before I headed there, a lady reply and said yes come on in. I arrived with my wife was seated by a male server and I asked again if they have happy hour, and was answered yes. Finally time to order, was told there has no happy hour available.  This is the worst way to lure your customer into your business. The worst part was when I tell the manager, he shrugged and kept watching his football game and not give a damn. Well he did offer the first 2 drinks @ happy hour price and that was it. Instead of instructing his employees about the happy hour instructions, he kept on watching his football game."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for drinks a couple weeks ago and while the service was decent and the beer was cheap I probably won't be going back. The inside looked like it hadn't been cleaned or swept in a week and there were bits of food and trash all over the floor. The booth we sat in was beat to hell, had worn out cushions and kinda had the feel of being duct tapped back together at one point. Didn't try any of the food but I'm not really feeling that lucky so I probably won't go back to this particular location."}
{"text":"Service was Terrible, couldn't modify one of orders cus it was \"new\" to the menu and she was rude about it."}
{"text":"I really love this place, we eat here like at least once a week lol #fatkidstatus My favorite is the blue cheese burger... ye i am a feta cheese... blue cheese lover comes with my nationality  Always good here... and the beat part is they have the rewards system they have which is awesome, the food pays for itself!! Ask the server next tine they will explain it to you... no gimmiks lol"}
{"text":"This is my favorite chain restaurant of all time.  This particular BWW just opened up in the area known as the South Strip.  It's on Las Vegas Boulevard, about 4 or 5 miles south of Mandalay Bay, in the same mega-shopping complex as a woefully outdated outlet mall.  The reason to come to BWW is (of course) the chicken wings.  I almost always get the boneless teriyaki, but you can get traditional wings too in more than a dozen different types of sauces, ranging from mild to dangerous.  BWW is more than just wings.  It has an unbelievable menu.  You can get a typical burger, pulled pork or grilled chicken sandwich.  There's also an awesome selection of appetizers.  Cheeseburger dippers, mini quesadillas, and my personal favorite mini corn dogs (with honey bbq sauce) are just some of the highlights.  Maybe my only gripe is that BWW does not serve traditional fries.  The only option are these things called Buffalo Chips, which are round fries about the size of nickels.  And of course, there's a good selection of beer.  BWW is the ultimate place to get together with friends, watch the game and gorge yourself on food.  This location in particular has tv's everywhere, ranging from massive to small, many of them high-def.  To top it off it has the trivia game to pass the time between games and waiting for your food.  The restaurant is split up, with the main dining area in front.  A huge wall separates it from the bar area in the back, where people can smoke.  I can't recommend BWW strong enough to have a good time.  The location near the Galleria Mall in Henderson is also very fun."}
{"text":"Host at the door was very friendly and he is the only reason I'm giving them a second star. We were seated fast and had a little wait for our server. she brought drinks and took our order. After almost a full hour of waiting for our food, it was wrong when it got to the table. Everything we ordered had something wrong. The waitress came to the table a total of 3 times during our 2 hour stay. There were four or five other tables throughout the restaurant and they staff wasn't busy at all. The manager was no where to be found when we asked for them."}
{"text":"THE best place for wings in Vegas. Great place to just hang n chill with friends, have a couple beers and chicken wings, and watch the game!! The place does tend to get busy during the games so come early if you want a good spot.  Tuesdays are .45 wings  Favorite sauces: parmesan garlic, spicy garlic, asian zing, and mango habanero They also have awesome fried pickles."}
{"text":"Great service because of Ed but really Bdubs- how do you run out of Guinness?? Come on now!!!"}
{"text":"This place was dirty . Trash on the floor ! Ants in the booths (Plus I'm allergic) & my boneless wings were cold !!!"}
{"text":"Just like any other BWW place this one is good for all wings lover. I always eat Thai curry and only Thai curry. Had a good experience and would go again when I have cravings for wings."}
{"text":"I usually hot Buffalo Wild Wings once every one to two weeks and the service and food is usually consistent. I was again in today and found that there is now a charge to use the table-top trivia/games consoles. The charge is $0.99. I find this new charge a bit outrageous and needless. Obviously it is planned either to be a revenue generator or to cover the cost being on the gaming network.  One of the reasons I like BWW is the ability to play trivia with my friends, it fosters some great competition!  Needless to say, today might have been my last visit to BWW. I hope they end up reversing their decision."}
{"text":"This was my last visit to any BWW. The service was terrible, our server just seen us for one drink order and once for our food order. It took 45 minutes to get our food and when it finally came it was cold and the chicken was over cooked and dry. And this is with ANY location I have been to. When the manager was confronted he said he'll have to figure something else out. Not apologetic or willing to make things right. Until things are 'figured out', I will not be back."}
{"text":"Pretty rough first attempt here. No silverware. Mediocre service. Asked for water three times before we got it. Sure it will get better as it is a new place but pretty rough thus far."}
{"text":"I really like coming here for all the TV's and the great wings! Mango Habanero is my favorite.  Spicy but I love it. My husband and I always sit at the bar and Jessica and Taryn are the best bar tenders. I'm giving it 4 starts due to the fact that they took away my pear cider beer and my husbands Killian' beer. Hopefully they bring both back soon. Other than that, we love the atmosphere and the food for sure."}
{"text":"Nice enough atmosphere, but poor service on a Friday evening especially since the place wasn't crowded... I guess that should have been a clue ! Anyway, the hot wings had a nice bite to them... finally, something flavorful and hot enough..."}
{"text":"We were seated right away the place was a ghost town. Really not even any other staff around. No drinks for 10 minutes just a lot of hangry stares. They close at 12a not 1awe got in before 10. Tension between the first two girls on staff we saw right when we walked in and one disappeared. Anyway. Ended up leaving and going all the way to stapley for wing stop. Not going to leave a tip for a bad impression. Like everyone else says. Service is lacking."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for a late night meal. I was also here to check out the late night happy hour. Place was nearly empty on a Friday night, but it took damn near 10 minutes to get a table. But figured mind as well wait.  Waitress was nice and knowledgeable, but seemed distracted most of the time. She even walked away as my husband was speaking to her. The extra star is for the food, which was great. Don't come to this particular BWW if you're looking for good service on a late night."}
{"text":"Please explain to me how big these chickens are that they get these miniature wings from,may be robin size? All wing places have the same sauce, that wasn't bad.But really shocked at size of these wings.  We usually order 2 dozen at Gateway or Mohans, and take home at least a half dozen...not here..and not again..I would go to the before mentioned places always,they have GREAT food and GOOD prices...I hate these big chain places that just RIP you off...grrrrr"}
{"text":"My favorite place to have chicken wings! Ike the great variety of flavors and their Tuesday and Thursday half price specials!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great location.  I'm a member of Kiwanis and the management will help us reserved an area for our bi-monthly meetings.  Their Happy Hour menu is great, lots of different food and drink to try every time I'm there.  Stop by and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great personality in staff. I was surprised to see the negative comments. LOVE their wings!"}
{"text":"Late night is not the time to go.. service is slow despite low occupancy, hostess is rude & cooks just aren't worth the food. Burnt fries & ummm an entire bottle of seasoning. Lol k."}
{"text":"The service here was pretty poor. Before receiving my appetizer I asked my server to please bring it with ranch, another server ended up bringing it without the ranch. When we asked her for ranch she informed us that she couldn't bring us any but would talk to our server. By the time our ranch made it out the appetizer was cold and it came out with our entree anyway. Our beverages were rarely filled and paying our bill took over twenty min. The food was pretty good though."}
{"text":"We tried to go to this location on a Thursday night at 8:30 PM. They had 20 staff for the 12 customers inside. We had our dog with us and asked if we could sit on the porch where no one else was sitting and they said no. I'm sure the staff would've like to get a tip for our table since we would have probably spent $30 or $40.   Just dumb customer service skills. This is my second bad experience at this location, I recommend you go to Ed's Tavern or Tavern on the Tracks if you want wings."}
{"text":"What can I say? I love BDUBs! Just as enjoyable as all the other BDUBs around so I give 'em 4/5. It can get crazy crowded...especially when the Cavs or the Buckeyes are playing...since this is the only one around for miles..   If you're new to BDUBs make sure you try their hot wings and all the different hot sauces. My fave is the Habanero sauce!!   There well over 20 TV screens here and they are able to change the channels to your liking. Even though it gets crowded sometimes it's fun to enjoy the ambience with loads of screaming and raving and intoxicated patrons!"}
{"text":"I read the bad reviews and I believe them. However, it's not the experience I have had on Monday, Wednesday or today Thursday. One thing is for certain, good looking young gals and guys flock to this, very busy, location.  The beer is constantly COLD (lol) and the service is friendly and attentive.  I don't know really where they fail for me. Perhaps I have been coming here far too long to notice, but, I get treated like a regular whenever I come here. This place is still a family friendly joint and I like bringing friends here.  The ONE THING that truly sucks is the parking. I almost forgot to mention that prior to this week I used to Uber here. There is a five minute wait for a parking spot. It does not help to have Uhaul next door being complete AH over parking spots. I would usually have to wait or back into the side parking to park. The parking really SUCKS. But, the eye candy and their chicken wings keep me coming here.  I don't wish to take away from the poor reviews because those bad reviews make a restaurant better.  Nonetheless, I still think of this place as a great sports bar and a fun place to share a meal with friends."}
{"text":"Last night I called bww in Las Vegas Blvd at 11:11pm. A female answered and I asked if they where still serving in the dining section because we had 4 kids and 4 adults, she said yes we can sit you guys in as long as you make it before 11:30. When we arrived at 11:24 the hostesses up front said they were no longer sitting people. She then when and got her manager Joe whom came out and was rude since the minute he approached us. Joe had the worst attitude and did not care to turn a party of 8 away when we had called and I showed him the call from my phone. It was his staffs fault not ours. I will no longer take my business there!"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times...once with some friends where we sat outside...it was slow that day, but we still had to search for our server multiple times. Food was good, we all shared wings and a couple apps. Then Hubby and I went when I was pregnant...it was so busy we were forgotten, and our food came out cold...luckily the manager was quite accomodating and comped any of the items that were not received or that came out cold or uncooked. Which included drinks like tea and hubby beer, as well as ribs and wings.   This last time we went and got wings. It was not too busy when we arrived mid day on a Sunday just before football season was gona start. The wings are very good and i love the assortment off flavors to choose from. 2 snack size are great for sharing...however drinks are way over priced and service was mediocre at best. At one point mid meal the music was turned up so loud I couldn't even hear my husband speaking from across the table. The seats in the booth are so old and worn in I sunk in so low I couldn't reach the table, hubby switched seats with me...the other side was a little better, but he also struggled with the poor seating. The food is really the reason the rating is 3 stars...coz on average service is never anything great or notable....and we have never and a good ambiance or vibe there... The other reason they get 3 stars is bc we ordered via door dash once and the food was great. Not having to deal with the servers or the actual resturant is wonderful... guess I'll stick to ordering delivery"}
{"text":"Great Food!!  The staff goes out of there way to make sure you are a satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Spending 4th of July in Canada meant that I had to at least eat at a American chain restaurant, so what better place than BWW.   Service was 4/5: only problem was that my service did not have patience. She was so quick. I wouldn't be able to finish my sentence and she was gone. But she was friendly.   Food was 3/5: the wing size is so much smaller than the American BWW. No idea why, but sauce and everything tasted the same.   Cleanliness was 4/5: everything was ok, the seats could be cleaned a bit."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is always fun and the food is good as long as you stick to chicken. If you sit in the bar area try to sit in Cassie or Suzie's section; they are the best."}
{"text":"Servers had no personality. Not quick on their feet or particularly accommodating. Not bad service, but just not very welcoming. Some of the seats rock back and forth on the floor because of dips in the floor. We tried two tables before we gave up. Also, I watched a person of color sit right down in the middle of the bar and not be approached for an entire four and a half minutes. They were not busy and this was unreasonable. It seemed discriminate and unfair from my POV."}
{"text":"This review is mainly in regards to their Fantasy Football Draft promo.  Last year ('08 season) one of my fantasy football leagues saw an ad for hosting your draft party here, so we thought we would give it a try. It was pretty cool...we booked a date and time several weeks in advance and when we arrived they had a nice private table set up for us. We also got a great draft kit that included a board (we were able to hang it up on the wall) and color coded player stickers that were bright and visible for all at the table to see. We also got gift certificates for future visits and a discount on the bill. We had such a good experience that there was no question that we would be back for our draft in '09.  So, this year I called three weeks prior to make our reservation. The guy manager that I spoke to was pleasant and helpful on the phone. I even had to call a couple of days later to change to date (same guy, very accommodating). On the day of our draft, very different story. I showed up early and noticed that a table was not set up for us. I inquired at the bar and the bartender just pointed to a high-top for us to sit at. This would not do, especially since we need a quieter area for the 12 of us to hear each other and wall space to hang our board. I started to wander over to the table we had last year and as a server walked by I asked for the manager. I waited, and waited, and still no manager, so my friends and I pushed tables together ourselves and sat down. Finally the manager arrived..she was very unwelcoming and told us we had to sit in the bar because she only had one bartender on and no server that could serve us. I explained to her that we wanted to sit here, that we had been here last year (same time at night) and it was an ideal setup, and that one of our players wasn't even 21 and able to sit in the bar. She was very rude and gave in to us sitting there eventually, but not without threatening us with the police!! Oh, yeah, we are in the dining/restaurant part of the place because like I said one of our guys is 20, and she's telling us that there is a curfew on the strip (mind you, we are no where near the resort corridor) and if the police come in, its not her problem. Then she went on to say that all the servers were leaving...we said \"fine\" and that we would just walk to the bar to order food and drinks. In the end we spent a lot less money because it was difficult to keep getting up in the middle of all our action to get more beer and food. No discount either. One other thing, another fantasy football team was there that same night and didn't seem to like being told they had to sit in the loud bar area either...they eventually moved all of their stuff in the dining/restaurant part too.  So...I am also in another fantasy league. For the last four years, this league has always done its draft at Hard Rock Cafe. This year, based on my experience from '08 I convinced them to have the draft and BWW. After the experience with my first draft of '09 I called the day before to reconfirm the reservation and to make sure that the table we wanted would be available. Of course, the manage (the guy) didn't have our reservation. What!! We made it three weeks prior!! good thing I called. Again, I got there early (eager to make sure everything was going to go well especially after I got everyone to break from our HR Cafe tradition). We did get the table we wanted and we were even going to get service this time! woo hoo! Lots more drinking and food this time! Just as everyone shows up the manager (a manager, not the lady from the previous draft) informed us that they had no more draft kits! Really!! Are you kidding me!! We booked three weeks ago and I had even confirmed with the day manager who said nothing about not having any draft kits!!! I was so embarrassed and pissed off. I really thought my team was going to have a good experience and want to come back year after year. I guess we are just going to have to go back to HR Cafe or I hear Hooters has draft parties?? BOO WILD WINGS!!!  P.S. I spent the first 25 years of my life in Buffalo....your wings are NOT real buffalo wings!!!  P.P.S One star for the potato wedges with cheese and the really nice, attentive server we had the second draft of '09."}
{"text":"Because this place is so close to home, I always end up going to this location to satisfy my chicken wings craving. I love getting the asian zing and mango habanero sauce for the wings as well as desert heat seasoning for the fries. Generally, my service here isn't amazing, but I tend to come on Tuesdays when it's cheaper. I can forgive them because of how chaotic it is. However, I went on a non-Tuesday and the service was just horrrribblleee. How was I getting better service on Tuesdays??  Since I've made wings before, I can understand why it takes so long for it to come out. I noticed that they wait for your entire party's orders to be ready before they bring anything out. I mean, I guess it's nice that everyone starts eating at the same time, but it's not nice when your food has been sitting out in the kitchen getting cold. Yes, some of the things we received were not hot anymore. I'd at least appreciate it if my fries came out right when it's ready.  Also took a long time to get our server's attention. My experience this time was extremely frustrating. Although this place is close to where I live, I may need to find another location.."}
{"text":"First off the entire meal was almost an hour and a half long! My daughter ordered the fries with bacon cheese they brought a clump of cold melted cheese with cold fries it was disgusting. The wings we ordered were soggy and Luke warm. I had the naked grilled strips which were good but over priced. We had a veggie boat that for what it was not worth the money. Overall just a bad place to eat. Will never go back to this chain although I normally try to avoid chain restaurants but we were traveling. That will teach me."}
{"text":"I just want to say we all were really impressed with the service and food at your metrocenter location last night.  What an amazing experience.  We had a mini reunion of over twenty people last night of grade school alumni, yr 1974.  Cholla Elementry School, Your staff handled everything just perfect. I didnt know what to expect since it was my first time to any of your establishments.. Again many thanks, we'll do it again.  AB~"}
{"text":"The server I had, Jackie talked to us like we were little kids! The wings I ordered were bland, ordered buffalo and there was barely any sauce on them. Shitty staff."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour tonight and it just so happens it was .60 cent boneless wings on Thursdays.   Happy hour is from 2-7pm I believe. Love the hours, but not the best as far as meals/drinks go.  They've got $3.00 appetizers (only on certain ones - mozzarella sticks, mini corn dogs, onion rings, chips and queso) but not on wings :( and $3.00 on certain beer and alcohol.. Again, not on what I ordered (I like my crown and 7)  Happy hour is only in the bar area. It was pretty crowded tonight but luckily we found a table.   Overall not a bad place if you're into sports and don't mind being in a loud restaurant."}
{"text":"We came around 7-8 pm on a Friday night, place was empty, maybe about 5 tables full and a few people by the bar. It took our waitress 22 minuets exact to even come up to us and greet us and then she didn't even ask us about our drinks she said I will bring you the menu.  Just so you guys know, there were about 4 waitresses on the floor that night, plus a bartender plus some other waiting staff that help with the food. She then disappeared for another 10 minuets brought us menus and asked what we wanted to drink. Drinks did not take long but we waited another 40 minuets for our food Sooo I am just wondering, if the restaurant is empty what can all these people that work there be doing???  They are obviously not serving anyone!!! I give 2 stars because the food was good but the customer service is horrible. Won't come to this location ever again!!!"}
{"text":"I honestly haven't tried much of the menu, but I haven't had anything bad.  The staff are usually good at keeping your drinks filleds. Stop by on Wednesday evenings for Trivia with a Twist!"}
{"text":"If you're young and are into sports this is the place for you.  This place is full of enthusiastic sports fans and there are TV's everywhere!  It's a sports bar on steroids..  The food is ok.  Typical bar fare.  The waitresses are very pretty and also attentive enough so that you're not waiting around for a refill."}
{"text":"I live close to this BWWs so we've gone quite a few times, and I have yet to have a good experience. We actually went last night and we were seated by a server station and I hung my purse on the side of my chair, and I had multiple servers knock it into me that I finally had to go take an extra chair from another table to put it on. Our server started out good, but after we got our drinks and appetizers she disappeared (their servers are very good at disappearing whenever we are there), so we had to grab another server to get more drinks and what not. It really wasn't that packed and it took at least half an hour longer than it should have because of bad service."}
{"text":"As is the norm with the Buffalo Wild Wings chain, the food was great. That said, the customer service at this particular location was absolutely ATROCIOUS,  and the reasoning behind this poor review. We arrived two hours early for a fight night event, and were informed that if we sat in the main dining hall there was a possibility of having strangers seated at the table with us because they were seating to capacity. We were given the option of sitting at the bar, and told that at the bar it would be first come first serve, and we wouldn't have to worry about sitting with anyone who was not in our party. We opted to do that instead. We were there early, very few people in the bar, so we asked our server if it would be possible to push two tables together to accommodate the amount of food we plan to buy and the two extra people that would be meeting us there. We were told that that would be fine, and the server actually helped to push the tables together for us. We changed out our hard wooden chairs for more comfortable chairs, again with the permission of the person operating the bar, ordered the first of our food, & Sat comfortably for the first hour and a half that we were there. After that change of shift occurred, and all of a sudden we couldn't have the chairs that we were using because they were saved for those who were gambling at the bar, and the two tables that currently held all of our food where suddenly not supposed to be together and we were forced to separate them. We asked to speak with a manager, who apologized for the inconvenience, acknowledged that her team should have been on the same page, and offered a meeting at another table that was larger and would accommodate our party, but  gave us a poor view of the monitor that we sat there for in the first place. I have never been to a place where the management's had so little control of their employees, and we're still unwilling to accommodate us in light of their poor communication with the team. On top of everything else, we got our food and were never brought silverware. Thank god for finger foods. We will NEVER be dining at this restaurant again. Very poor service."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Sat at table in the bar area.  Waited more than 10 minutes for drink orders 15 mins for menus 25 mins for apps  And 45 mins for wings  After they brought the wrong order it took 10 mins for them to fix it.  Worst part of all the place was empty. I'd hate to see how long you wait if they were busy.   Customer service is terrible Wings were terrible.   Meanwhile I'm waiting for a refill and 4 managers were standing behind us laughing and talking about personal buisness and laughing extremely obnoxiously   Never ever will I go to any Buffalo Wild Wings ever agin. Experience ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Ordered an 8 piece take out to find that when I got home with my order there was only six. My husband ordered traditional wings and got boneless. I know everything about this location is awful considering the reviews but do you really have to hire employees who can't even count or know the difference of which wing is what?! What a rip off. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"A cheap pig out location! Tuesdays 60cents traditional or boneless wings is what I usually go for, with a bunch of friends. Large spacious, much better than the old state street location. However, too many flashing screens and its loud..   Definitely reminds me of being a college kid again, but who doesn't like having cheap food from time to time? If you head there before 7pm, there are drinks and appetizers special.  Good items to go for - (for mild spicy eaters)  Parmesan and garlic (mild spicy) Salt and Vinegar Honey BBQ Mango Habanero (kinda spicy)  Always get the buffalo chips with cheese. OMG so good.... junkie.   If you wanna feel less greasy, get the veggie plate. It's for your good -.-  AND, ask for drinks specials - you might get really good deals!  They also really helpful with splitting checks!  Hooray for undergrad cheap places!"}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong with Buffalo Wild Wings! Came in here with a couple of friends to watch two different NBA Playoff games.  The food is solid. Nothing fancy or gourmet about this place, but you can get wings, popcorn shrimp or anything else that tickles your food baby.  I would recommend staying away from the Parmesan Garlic wings. They came out crispy and overcooked. When we asked the server to bring us a new batch, they tasted turrible. Everything else though? Awesome.  Beer selection is pretty good. Everything from your mass domestics, to some craft. Try a Sierra Nevada or Sam Adams Boston Lager with something really spicy. It'll change your life.  Bathrooms are amazing! Each standing stall in the Men's room had a TV. Nothing better than watching TV while you finish up.  Also, the best part? PLENTY of TV's. My friends were more interested in the Laker game, so they watched that, while I watched the Jazz game. We all sat at the same table, and were still able to be social with each other because we were surrounded by TV's.  One last thing. It's 24 hours! Holler."}
{"text":"We ordered wings to go tonight and Ashley was remarkable. Her phone etiquette was astonishing and her attentiveness to our conversation. Thank you Ashley for being the highlight of my night."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by for lunch we were in a time crunch, they were not busy maybe about 3 tables including us. The service was very slow, over a 15 minute wait for a salad and a wrap (which they messed up) we were given a timer if it went past 15 minutes your meal is free. While we waited there were two managers standing near us not really concerned with the wait even though another server stopped by to let them know our timer had gone past 15 minutes. After we got our meal they made the wrap wrong so they had to remake it at that point we just asked for a salad instead. No manager came over to talk to us and we ended up having to pay for one of the salad even though we waited past 15 minutes for them. Why have a system in place that you will not honor. What bothered me the most was the lack of management in this place and concern for customers."}
{"text":"We waited 10 minutes for a waitress to great us. When they delivered our food they did not make sure that we had silverware or napkins. We waited 5 minutes for a return waitress and finally got up to get them ourselves before our food got cold. When the waitress did finally come back she dropped a side of BBQ sauce behind my daughter that splattered all over her. The waitress walked away without even apologizing. The service was the worst I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"I thought their wings are incredibly good. I never missed their Tuesday/Thursday specials. I tried almost all their sauces available, including new and limited time. The only complaints I have are the staffs, they aren't as friendly as other places. Sometimes when I go in to pick up my take-out order they'd tell me to go to the bar and ask for them. When I do go to the bar, I have to wait to be noticed by a busy bartender. Why would they hire 3-4 people hanging around at the door and I have to go look for my food? You know other restaurants around the corner offer curbside pickup?"}
{"text":"I'm convinced BWW has officially gone down hill.   It's so sad BWW decided to start killing baby chickens for their wings, because that's how big they were.   We waited five minutes to be greeted, in the bar (not AT the bar). I noticed our eventual waiter was effing around in the back too, which pissed me off. He also didn't seem to think he was on the job, being paid... I don't know if he was stoned, stupid, or both.   My wrap was great, but that's about it. They also had country music playing loudly; why not pre-season football? Isn't that what BWW is known for? Sports? Not line dancing.    Overall paying $40 for 4 on-sale beers, a wrap and 12 wings won't be bringing me back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I LOVE wings and BWWs is my favorite nation-wide, hands down. The sauces are so tasty. Hot is my favorite, especially when I get the bottom of the bag - it's the hottest without taking it up a notch! There is nothing on the menu that disappoints me, but we usually get wings. (The last star is for the inconsistent fries - although today was perfect; and like other reviews, the broken wings.)  The Gilbert BWWs is a weekly visit for our family, especially during football season! The staff and management are always willing to put your game on somewhere- as long as all the tv's aren't spoken for. Football season is very busy for this location (& loud!) The energy makes it fun!!!  The Gilbert location is family owned for over a decade and they recently opened a location in Casa Grande.  The weekend day staff in Gilbert is friendly & service-oriented, even though most of them are pretty \"new\" these days (less than 2 years tenure.) And, the management, even the new ones are pretty responsive.  We've been coming here for years and I'm sure we will keep coming here for years to come."}
{"text":"I frequent this location often-We usually order online or phone it in and get food to go- and usually pay with a credit/debit card.  BE AWARE ----my husband gave a five dollar tip (granted, he should have given more, but in his defense it wasn't a big order and it was to-go) and his card was charged with a 40 dollar tip.  Only because I was looking over my account regarding another issue did I question the large purchase at BWW. I called and spoke to a manager, and was told it would be looked into. The extra 35 dollars was refunded several days later, but I never received a call back, or any apology of any sort.  That is extremely shady- and stealing! To not even get at least an apology is poor business practice."}
{"text":"I really like everything about BWW! The traditional wings are the best as far as I'm concerned, and if you like it HOT, then the Mango Habanero is the only way to go but I also really like the Asian Zing too! All the appetizers are great especially the fried pickles, and sliders! The service is exceptional considering how busy it can get on a big game day/night! I have a few favorite servers but everyone is friendly and really good at their job! I recommend this location all the time especially for .50 cent Tuesday wings!"}
{"text":"Cool location. Bartender was a really nice guy forgot his name though. Open 24/7 so that's a plus"}
{"text":"I had a large party coming to this location around 11:00pm, so a member of the party called the restaurant a day before, so they could be prepared. They said that it would be fine. The party came in around 11:00, and the entire party had to wait 25 minutes before we were even SEATED. A friend of ours came in after us, got seated, and finished eating before our orders were even taken. They took a while before our orders were taken, and when the waitress asked what I wanted, I said I wanted an order of cheese curds. The waitress then informed me that they were out of them. This isn't THAT big of a deal for me, but if you want them late at night, just be aware that they can and may run out of them. Also, I ordered a Shirley temple drink, and the waitress never brought it to me. She even asked me to clarify what a Shirley temple was, so she definitely heard me. Luckily, she didn't charge me for it. She also neglected to write another member of my party's order down, and didn't deliver a number of the items that were ordered. This usually isn't a huge deal to me, because I work in food service, and I understand that things get busy. However, The lack of customer service was just kind of sad. Especially because we called ahead of time, and they still weren't prepared. By the way, our waitresses name was Perla, in case you want to know who to avoid."}
{"text":"The wing are good! Fried pickles are super yummy! The breeding is always crunchy! The service is a little slow. There are people here but it's not packed and doesn't constitute the wait!"}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE for chicken parts nobody wants. I get chicken breasts for less. Sauces were good. Wait was long. Loved the TV screens for football.  Tuesdays would be the only time I returned for lower priced wings. Not many deals like other locations."}
{"text":"Service was so slooooow at this location.  Food was fine and our waitress was fine but we just weren't checked on very frequently.  I will give them kudos though: they have ipads you can borrow for your kids to be entertained.  As long as it took for our food to come, I'm glad there was something to keep them occupied!"}
{"text":"Last Saturday night my friends and I decided to meet at BWW-Downtown.  We wanted to catch some of the bb games and the Brewer game before heading to the comedy club.  The place was pretty busy but we got there when it started clearing up, so we were sat right away.  It took a while for a server to come over, but finally she did and we ordered our drinks.  It took a while for the server to come back with 2 of our 5 drinks; she explained that the bartender was backed up.  A little while later 2 more of our drinks arrived. At this point we ordered food and a little while later our last drink arrived to our table.  We all kind of noticed that the beer wasn't too crisp; leaving us to ponder how often they clean their tap lines.    Our food took a long time.  It was mainly wings, an order of nachos and a wrap.  At one point one of my friends asked if we had ordered to whole kitchen.  Our server didn't seem to be too worried, not once telling us she would see what was taking so long, or apologizing for the long wait.  It took her a while to get another drink order from 2 of us.  At one point a manager stopped by and asked if we needed anything.  I pointed to my empty beer glass and said I'd have another, and then asked for a PBR and my husband ordered a Bloody Mary.  The manager walked away and found our server and told her what our order was.  She then came over with the manager to confirm our order; again I said I'd like a PBR.  Our drinks arrived and my husband's bloody was not a nice bloody red but an almost translucent magenta color.  No beer chaser with the bloody because they stopped doing that.    Finally our food arrived, no napkins or silverware.  My friend had to ask for napkins and silverware (for the boneless wings and nachos), the server brought back napkins only.  My mango habanero wings were very hot I just began gulping my beer, not noticing that it was not a PBR.  My husband took a drink and told me the server brought me the IPA I had ordered first, not a PBR.  I finished it anyway though I had ordered a different beer for a reason.  (My wings were super hot.)  Towards the end of the meal, my husband offered me his olives from his bloody.  He took out the toothpick with the olives and we all saw a very long dark hair coiled around the olives.  We managed to see our server again, she had not bothered to check on us about our food, and she just looked at the olives and hair and said \"oh we'll take that off your check,\" and walked away.  Didn't apologize, didn't offer to get him something else and didn't even take it off the table.  A little bit later she came back and said she had taken it off and walked away.  Again, no apologies, no offer for another drink and she left it on the table.  We figured a manager would stop by at some point....nope.    We asked for checks and when I looked at mine I did see I was charged for 2 IPAs.  Our server came back and I asked her about it, reminding her that I had ordered a PBR.  \"We don't have PBR anymore,\" blank stare.  At that point we just wanted to get out of there, but I wondered why her and her manager didn't just tell me that in the first place.  Also, why would she not ask if there was something else I wanted?  She just assumed I'd have the same beer and brought it without letting me know it wasn't the beer I had ordered.  I thought about finding the manger, just to ask him why he didn't tell me they didn't have the beer I had ordered but of course he was nowhere to be found.  It was my first time at this BWW and probably will be my last time.  3 out of the 5 of us work in the food service industry and couldn't believe how poorly this place was run.  Our service wasn't the best either, clearly (we hope) this is her first serving job and she'll learn from her mistakes.  But the fact that the management seems to be nonexistent, makes for a bad experience.  If you want to eat at BWW, order take-out...they can't screw that up can they?"}
{"text":"Now I know why the ratings suck. Sitting on the patio and everyone around us has cups of water. Fine, maybe they asked but it's happy hour and I asked if there's a menu? Why give me a menu when you can tell like 5 things ABOUT the menu instead. Like why would I want to read it and see my options. So I just had to stick to my beer. Oh I had to hunt down my waiter to get those beers. I usually don't write reviews but today I felt like I had to. I just want to have some drinks, branch out but I definitely felt limited. After being denied a drink menu seems kind of redundant to come here again for happy hour. I was so excited too! It's been awhile since I've been to BWW, maybe a different location next time?"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and ordered two packs of the 20 pieces online.  I had a gift card and so needed to pay upon arrival. They called me back to verify about sauces and when I arrived was greeted quickly, but they had to get someone who did the take out. They signed me up for the club and I was surprised by the good customer service of willing to enter the receipt info for credit for transaction at a later time because it would not input immediately"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. My friend and I went in to watch a football game. Granting they were a lil busy, we literally sat there for an entire half without being asked what we wanted to order.  Not one of their servers asked if we needed water. not one. For an entire half.  Terrible service."}
{"text":"Very adequately staffed however majority of staff members are extremely rude and display HORRIBLE customer service. We almost left however the manager offered a different server, who was the only staff member that we saw smile and greet customers. The food expediter was extremely friendly, as well."}
{"text":"We decided to come here, as the location closer to our house has disappointed us twice now- this one did not! We were instantly greeted by two hosts as we entered and were immediately waited on upon sitting down. Our food came out in a very timely manner and our server, Rae, was very friendly! Attentive without being overbearing. Restrooms are clean, music not too loud. We will def be back here!"}
{"text":"Great location. Great food. Excellent busser/runner. The bartender Melissa was my server. The restaurant was not busy, not too many people in there this late and she still could not manage to assist me or the guys sitting near me. Honestly I've never had worse service in my life to the point that I'm still in shock and had to write this."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in after receiving a gift card from family. What a disappointment. So expensive and mediocre wings at best."}
{"text":"My husband and I came because we had a gift card and we have heard how good the food is supposed to be. Unfortunately, we won't return. Wings at over  buck a wing? I was floored. We had a couple of drinks, cheese curds and fried mushrooms. Those were the tiniest curds and mushrooms we have ever seen. They tasted okay. Portions are small. Prices are large. The service was adequate. We won't be back.. Too many other places to go to get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Tonight, on .60 cent boneless night, i, and three friends, came in to enjoy one of our favorite spots. Our server's name was 'Bri', and although she was a very sweet girl, the service was absolutely atrocious. Not only that, but when my boyfriend and i received our wings, they were not only cold, but I was missing 5 lemon pepper and when they finally came out, they had about 15% lemon pepper seasoning, and I had to wait about 15 mins for Bri to realize i was trying to get her attention and ask for extra seasoning. Completely disappointed and questioning whether or not I will ever visit another Bdubs again."}
{"text":"Service here sucked. They were so slow. We had a large group and could tell they couldn't handle that. The only changing table for the baby was in the family restroom. I waited outside the restroom (I checked the stalls in the main bathroom. Most of which were empty. After waiting to change my baby's diaper a single girl came out of the family bathroom. Clearly not a family or anyone with a baby. Just some intoxicated girl. The hostesses who are all located by the restrooms didn't even notice they were all too busy gossiping with each other. Worst buffalo wild wings I've ever been to. The food was sub part and the drinks were weak. My water was constantly empty. Choose a diff buffalo wild wings they have so many other locations that are better."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this location exists! In the heart of Cleveland, I can't see why you WOULDN'T put a BW3's here, duh it only makes sense. Walking in, I was surprised at how wide it was. The sports bar starts on one street and ends in another. Everything is newly remodeled and the huge screens makes it the perfect place for sports fan. Our waiter informed us it was his second day on the job and we couldn't even tell. He was very nice and came around multiple times to make sure we were doing okay. I don't think anyone can go wrong at BW3s but I especially look forward to going to this downtown location again."}
{"text":"The wings weren't edible, and the service  was non existent. I payed 14$ for 12 wings that are discussing. It took 30 minutes to get an order. My friends and I couldn't stand the restaurant and were forced to leave with out enjoying."}
{"text":"I use to stop in every once in a while for a grilled chicken wrap and a game of Golden Tee after I would get off work.  I would even call in an order for take out here and there.  The bar is always empty on grave yard when I would go in.  Old bartender was nice, but the new one looks like he is always busy, even when no one is there.  I called in my order last time and it couldn't have been more wrong.  Once I get home, I refuse to go back to fix the problem.  I just won't order food anymore.  Not to mention they did away with the grave yard wing special.  I will stop in for a beer and game of Golden Tee, but that is about it."}
{"text":"So went back after the opening week debacle and things have settled in. They are more focused on being Buffalo Wild Wings which is wings and sports on TV. Only issue I continue to have is their lack of selection of IPA's. Too much national big brewers on tap."}
{"text":"Ordered a Pacifico, the server knowingly brings me a Sierra Pale Ale since they ran out of Pacifico??? Makes no sense."}
{"text":"Only got carry out but the girls taking my order were fabulous and fast. She even took my order out to show me that everything was there. The food was great as usual, and hot."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY, spend your money else where. This place wrote the book on bad costumer service. Went there with the family and kids, and they had $10 cover, even for the kids, for a pay per view event. You could get food credit, so there were really trying to make sure you spent $10 per person. But the boneheaded manager would only accept cash to get in, and if you didn't have cash, you could use their ATM and pay a fee. They wouldn't accept a credit card, or even think of any alternative. So we didn't go in. So good luck in this economy, Mr. Buffalo Wild Wings owners, making do, with a crappy customer service approach and boneheaded manager. So we went to Elephant Bar instead and had a great meal."}
{"text":"I come here because the food is always good and enjoy their wing specials. Unfortunately, i don't know if it's because there are only a couple workers in the front when I come, but the service is always very slow. I can normally count on waiting at the bar to order for at least 10-15 mins before they even come by and say anything. Today on the other hand, was much worse. By the time the bartender came around I jus asked him to cash my voucher n spoke to the manager on duty, which isn't the first time I've asked to speak to one, n probably not see anything get done. So on that note, this location jus lost a weekly customer!"}
{"text":"This place is yummy. My mom and step-dad ordered 24 wings with a basket of onion rings. My hubby and I ordered the grilled chicken breast burger with a side salad it came with your choice of hot sauce, i asked for the hot and on the side...good idea because their hot sauce is HOT but delicious!!!  The onion rings are great and so are the wings. I loved this place.   Will def. go back next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The wings are so delicious!!! A lot of snacks.Mango lemonade is my favorite. watching games with friends is good."}
{"text":"Our server was great, although he was working on Thanksgiving day he was very attentive and had a big smile and better yet he kept them beers comin!!!  I love that they have tablets with games for the kids! We were able to enjoy the whole football game without any kid bothering us telling us they were bored!! Lol I love this BWW!!"}
{"text":"We love coming here to watch the games and get good wings! They didn't disappoint tonight! I got traditional wings with buffalo sauce and chipotle dry rub and my husband got boneless with honey bbq, the new Korean bbq, and (wait for it) salted caramel bbq! We were so pleasantly surprised with the new flavors!  It works! Wish we ordered more to take home!"}
{"text":"My recently rekindled love affair with BDub is over. I was one of the weirdos that camped out over night on the eve of the Grand Opening of this BDub years ago (number 61 in line). \"Free\" wings for a year kept me coming for the first 12 months. After that it was a sense of loyalty. Quality continued to decline and finally completely fell off the charts. After way too many consecutive bad experiences, I said no more.   Fast forward to May 2017, I gave them another shot and it was pretty good. I thought things were back to the way they used to be. I was wrong. Today, Not only were the wings under seasoned. They were under cooked! Maybe not raw, but pretty close. When I complained, my server looked at the half eaten wing and shook her head in disgust and happily removed them from the table and the bill. I think that was only fair and appreciate her effort to correct the situation.   But here is the funny part. She then said \"it is difficult to cook chicken wings correctly. Sometimes they leave the feathers on them.\"  LOL!  When CHICKEN wings are your claim to fame, they should be perfect every time! Or maybe I should have just ordered BUFFALO.   I'm done!"}
{"text":"This is a great place  The best wings in Calgary great selection  Love the wild sauce  Could not ask for better managers and staff"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. And it wasn't our server that was to bad it was everyone around her also that had a bad attitude and were useless when it came to doing something as paying or getting napkin.  I literally had to stand up with my baby to get attention to pay so we can leave but even then nobody acknowledged the fact that it was time for us to go."}
{"text":"I love BW3. This one is not good. The staff and managers do not care about the guests."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time on yesterday to order out. I knew it was going to be busy since Sunday is football, but surprisingly I was able to order pretty fast. My order wasn't anything crazy just wings for myself and some friend also ordered fries and a kids meal. The amount came out to less then I was expecting. After ordering I sat and watched the game about 20 minutes later one of the employees told me the cook messed up the order and it would be another 3 minutes. About 10 minutes later my food came out and the manger came over to me. She apologized for the wait and gave me a $10 off coupon. I appreciated that she noticed but the time I waited wasn't the problem. I walked across the parking lot to my work with the food. I opened everything up and it was cold. So did they really messed up my order or was it just sitting there because everyone was busy?"}
{"text":"My husband & I have been avid BWW goer's ever since we moved to Gilbert 3 years ago. We frequented the McQueen & Elliot location almost once a week the entire time we lived nearby.  The wings are awesome and it's the best place to watch any kind of sports. Every time friends come in town we take them to Thursday night $.50 wings & $3 you-call-its.   We have since moved to East Mesa and last night two good friends where in town visiting. We were on our way home when they asked about BWW and said they had been really looking forward to making a trip there while they were in town.  It was 12:30 am and we were driving nearby this location. I wasn't sure what time they closed so I looked up the number on my phone quickly and called to ask. Someone answered the phone and said \"we close at 1.\" We knew we were cutting it close but were craving wings so we decided we would run in, order wings togo, have one round of drinks while they were being cooked and make it out right at closing. We have all worked in the service industry so we are very cognizant of common restaurant courtesy and always tip extremely well.  When we walked in we were immediately faced with the manager, Shana I believe, who very rudely said \"we are closed.\" My husband looked at his phone and said it is only 12:40 and we just called and someone told us you close at 1. She said she was indeed the person who answered the phone and her clock actually said it was 12:55 and they are closed. We explained our intention of ordering togo and having one drink and she again very rudely  said the bar was absolutely off limits they did last call 20 minutes ago and if we HAD to order food it we would be waiting for awhile because she would have to \"refire\" up the kitchen and get everything back out since its all been cleaned up already.   At this point we had no intention of staying and were really offended at how we were being treated. We calmly explained we would have appreciated if she had been truthful with us on the phone. If she had simply replied that they close at 1 but the kitchen has already cleaned up and last call for the bar was 20 minutes ago we would not have even wasted the time to drive there.  She did not apologize and was still speaking to us with a ridiculous attitude. Everyone was frustrated at this point and as we started to a leave a server that had walked up earlier called my husband an \"asshole\". This was completely appalling, so unnecessary, absolutely undeserved and insanely unprofessional.   We will NEVER go back to this location, if you are craving BWW stop in to the McQueen & Elliot location where all of the staff are super friendly, accommodating and professional."}
{"text":"We were seated and NEVER got any service. No drink order or anything. This was our second time trying them and it was worst!"}
{"text":"Whew, here now and the kitchen is way behind.  Strange because not very crowded.  Very lame whiskey pour.  I am out as soon as my appetizer that I ordered 45 minutes ago shows up."}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars I would! I live BWW and never have I ever received this bad customer service. It took them ten min. to just get our drink order! The server was completely horrible. And this is the second time I've gone, so I know it's the place in general. I even saw other tables having to get up to ask servers for help. I am in customer service so I know what is is expected even in a crowded time, but! The both times I've been here is was not busy at all! So I see no excuse to this lack of attention to its customers.... Completely horrible!  I will definitely drive to a different location, even if it's far out of my way."}
{"text":"Great wings, but pricey.  Went here the other day with my buddy and we expected the prices to be about what they are at native New Yorker.  Quite a bit pricier.  Great wing sauce and good service!  Bartender is super nice!"}
{"text":"We love this Bdubs more than the other ones around town, it's personal and friendly. It is never over packed and always welcoming! Service can be slow at times but order yourself an appetizer and wait!"}
{"text":"There isn't much that stands out from this particular Buffalo Wild Wings compared to others I have been to aside from the service we received at this location. Our server was very friendly and helpful the entire time, however it turns out that he made a mistake and forgot to put our order in. My husband and I noticed it was taking a while but didn't mention it to anybody working there. We just figured it was a busy afternoon. When they realized the mistake they made the manager came up to our table and explained the situation and apologized. She also said that because of their mistake they would be giving us 25% off of our bill. Our server then also apologized multiple times.  The fact that we didn't even complain and that they realized their own mistake and made up for it when we were practically oblivious to the situation really impressed me. I work in an office close by to this BWW and will definitely make sure to give them more business in the future because of this. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food itself isn't anything special, but that being said I do enjoy their wings more than most places!"}
{"text":"The waiter we had was very nice, however the place was very dirty and there were three employees eating. There were 8 dirty tables and staff were just sitting around. BWW really needs to have their owners come in and see how customers are treated."}
{"text":"AVOID,  AVOID,  AVOID. Used to go here 3x a week, but it keeps getting worse.  Tonight was the final straw . Put in the same order I always do, small wings half and half on the sauce. Server told me they can't  do that. Nice guy, I explained to him I order this a couple times a week. He went and got his snowflake manager who told me they won't do that and haven't in 6 months. Told him I did that twice last week alone.  Snowflake told me too bad, it messes with their numbers, so in summary, long time customer is told to piss off. I own a company with 50+ employees and we do policy changes all the time, and they're not always popular. However,  we would never treat anyone with the disregard that this kid did. We won't be back and we'll be very vocal to everyone to AVOID."}
{"text":"I've tried it a few times. Slow service, loud customers, lousy food. For a better experience try Sheetz next door."}
{"text":"This is a review of just a casual trip to B-dubs as well as camping out and watching an Ohio State Buckeyes game.  YES! This is an Ohio State Buckeye backer bar. And in a way, it is a B1G bar. But make no mistake about it, the Buckeyes come first.  In general their food is pretty good. I think their wing quality has gone down in that they are more-or-less wings with your sauce of choice splashed on them. This is OK, so long as you know this is what you are getting.  If you go with children be sure to see if they have any of their gaming systems available. They are good to keep the kids entertained while you eat or watch a game.  As for the Buckeye backer bar, I think this is one of the best places to go. I have gone to Bottled Blonde and while BB goes all out to cater to us Buckeyes, I found it lacking. Sure, the alumni association is there, but that is good or bad. Good if you are an alumni, bad if you are not. At B-dubs there are plenty of chairs/tables to sit at and everyone is friendly. I also REALLY like that they have raffles and drawings the entire game. Literally, I think every time I have watched a game here and it is a big game when they do drawings... I have won something.  And I am someone that NEVER wins anything in life.  The only thing that is bad is that since the Wolverine B-dubs closed, they now come to the Buckeye B-dubs and watch the games. This makes for some interesting tensions since we are huge rivals."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to bdubs I have an awesome time, yesterday did not hold any exceptions. In fact yesterday was the most fun I've ever had at bdubs and a huge part of that had to do with the Arizona Derby Dames being there. It was cool to see another sport other than your typical basketball, football, and baseball. It was also extremely awesome to see the girls that were on the TV screen sitting right next to me. Thanks Buffalo Wild Wings for showing me a new experience."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  boneless Thursdays means 65 cents per heavily battered crispy nugget \"wings\". The normal wings are about regular size but I was surprised at how decently sized the boneless wings were (though there is quite a bit of batter, so perhaps that bulked up the nuggets a little).  the heat scale offered here is a little more accurate than @ Wild Wings. both the medium flavours of Jammin' Jalapeno and Caribbean Jerk managed a little tingle on the tongue  the PULLED PORK POUTINE portion is PETITE; the picture on the menu definitely makes it seem like there'd be more food. upon ordering, our waiter warned us that most people tend to find the poutine dry and asked if we wanted any of the wing sauces on the side. HOLD UP -- if you know it's dry..fix it?! in any case, we ordered honey bbq on the side which helped to balance out the sodium laden gravy. poutine comes with potato wedges, not fries; shredded cheese, not curds.   this joint won't stand out as my next pick to eat out but for when the leafs are playing -- TVs are a plenty both in the dining room and at the bar; you'll be able to watch multiple games every which way you sit"}
{"text":"Found across the nation, this Buffalo Wild Wings location does a good job!  We stopped in on a busy night during happy hour.  There was a wait in the dining room but the bar is open seating.  Luckily we found a table with our name on it.  Our waitress was over quickly to get drink orders and take advantage of the HH price.  She was friendly and attentive even with the hectic time.    We decided to share the Tablegating Sampler.  This comes with wings, spinach dip and pretzels & cheese which were all great!  We chose the chipotle BBQ rub for the wings.  They had a great flavor! The spinach dip is served with warmed pita chips.  I absolutely loved the chips.  There were two pretzels which was perfect.  The plate also came with cheddar bacon jalapeño pepper bites.  I didn't really care for the flavor and consistency of these.  I think it would be better with a cream cheese filling than the cheddar.     It was a great visit overall.  It doesn't hurt they are a Red Wings bar for this Michigan girl.  Now I know where to watch the big games with some good food!"}
{"text":"Waited up front for 5 mins at hostess stand with no help so we sat ourselves and sat for another 10 minutes without any help. Servers didn't even acknowledge our presence. Never had worse service!! We walked out with no acknowledgement even though the take out desk had 3 employees hanging out on their phones obviously not busy."}
{"text":"Best Buffalo every I called them and told them there was a back up on the 17 so Toni the manager said no problem we will remake your order than I ran out of gas on the way there and I was like an hour later and so Toni the manager came out and said u know what I had a ruff night so I got my good for free that is great customer skills and good service I highly recommend this Buffalo they were nice and friendly and wanted to make sure I was taken care of good job Toni and the night crew tonight y'all did a good job and I am very thankful"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero I would have but since I can't here is a one star the reason for my bad review is me and my husband and children we love BWW B-dubs I even you to work for in Louisiana and Manage it to so I am a loyal customer, So me going to this one I was very not pleased. First off we went in on a Sunday after Church we asked how long the wait was the young lady told me 45 min to an hour and I told my husband not today lets go across the street and see how long the wait was there well needless to say there was a wait everywhere so we went back to Buffalo about 5 min later exactly and the young man that was at the greeter stand there no wait we can sit you write away and my husband and I look at each other and said wait there was just a wait he said no there was no wait I can seat you know I was like okay and we got seated and I told my husband that was odd, as we got seated we had to wait at least 15 min at the table before are server came which I had to ask for I was like wow this is ridiculous I have never been treated like this ever the waitress had an little of funky attitude and I notice the manager went to every other table but ours to ask how was a service and was everything ok and I was like wow and then when are food came it was cold and I paid for extra stuff and didn't get had to ask for it and there was an attitude about that and also when are food came there was no napkins are no silverware for my kids to eat there food I had to ask for that and that took forever that my kids started eating with hands I was like you know what I am done with this place can we get the check and needless to say oh they brought the check super quick didn't haft to wait for that that was the fastest service we had the hole time I mean we didn't even get refills like you are supposed to I know it is a restaurant and it can get busy but you should forget about your table I really fill like we were racial profile because I am black and my husband is white and we just got treat really badly I will never go back to this one ever again life because it just rude"}
{"text":"Don't waste hour time. Wife & I took our 18 yr old w cerebral palsy to NASCAR HOF as a reward for a tough dr visit. Went into the attached BW3s to get drinks & chips. 6 staff, 2 customers at bar & empty otherwise. We sat at a table next to the bar. None of the 6 came to help & there was no one behind the bar. My wife approached the staff and asked if we could be served. She was told we had to sit at the bar. Tough to do with a kid in a wheelchair. If you are in a wheelchair, find some where else to eat. We did. Never again. We were nice, left quietly. My wife spoke to the manager who seemed to be embarrassed  & apologized. But it happened."}
{"text":"I was so close to giving this place 1 star because the service started out pretty rough, but I understood it being Saturday night and all. My drink was really good, I now know that Angry Orchard and Jack can combine beautifully. Fried pickles were just OK *cough, my work has better ones, cough*.  My black bean burger was actually pretty good and I wasn't expecting much. $30(ish) for a bar drink, app, and 2 entrees, not bad at all. Shout out to Cassandra and Kat, they are great!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Buffalo Wild Wings; but my last trip left more to be desired.  Most visits have been generally great experiences, unfortunately my non-meateating friend was served a 100% beef patty, not the blackbean burger he ordered.  My Spinach-Artichoke Chicken Flatbread was delicious.  They have delicious options aside from their wings."}
{"text":"Do not eat here on cheap wing nights (Tuesdays and Thursdays). I've come to realize that both the service and the food are terrible on these days."}
{"text":"Last Friday, my wife and I visited this location as we have several times in the past. This will be the last time. My wife ordered pull pork sandwich with coleslaw side and a glass of water with a slice of lemon. The glass was delivered without the lemon slice which we pointed out to the server.  We then noticed there was no cutlery for the coleslaw and needed to search out a server.  The pull pork exterior was burnt/overcook and tough to chew. I had a small order of wings with honey garlic sauce which turned out to be watery.  The last couple of pieces were undercooked.  This was pointed out to the server who summoned the manager.  The manager listened to our complaints and proceeded to describe the cooking process for the wings ignoring my wife's concerns.  She basically stated that the wings could not be undercooked due to the process they follow. I could see residual blood on several of the pieces and the last two were definitely undercooked. The end result was she offered to remove the charge for the wings. I spent Saturday and Sunday with and upset stomach which cleared up on Monday. As mentioned we have been to this location several times with satisfactory experience to bring us back.  That will no longer happen. I gave a one star rating because of past experience."}
{"text":"I haven't even eaten my food yet - I ordered my food 45 minutes ago (to go order) Been waiting for 15 min inside.  I was told it would be ready in 20 min..  They brought it out at 35 min - missing 2 items in the bag - them brought the remaining items out 10 min later.  45 min total.  I love bww but this location has serious issues."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with server and management. Went to this location around 10:30pm on a Friday night. The food wasn't as good as normal and the waiter never refilled the water. The meal was around $20 and I tipped to make it $24. The next week I was looking at my bank statement and the server had added to the 20% tip I gave and made it more than the food itself. After Contacting management multiple times all they said was sorry and nothing was done to the server. Beware of this happening at this location."}
{"text":"I had a blast at Buffalo Wild Wings.  The place has giant televisions tuned to sports everywhere and the fun and addictive \"blue crack\" trivia game.  The wings are crispy and come in quite a few varieties.  I love the fact that they have self serve soft drinks."}
{"text":"When we walked in, we asked for a booth and the hostess said they have booths but they don't have workers... we probably should have walked out then. We sat down and waited about 10 minutes to get our drink order taken by a VERY sweaty man, at the time we just ended up ordering an appetizer and our food to avoid another long wait. It took a while to finally get our drinks that the sweaty man brought which I felt was very unsanitary. It took even longer to get our food. When we finally got our food, the appetizer came out with it. We declined the appetizer asking them to take it off of our bill and they agreed. When we got our bill, the appetizer was still on there so we had to wait even longer to have them bring another ticket. I understand sometimes people call in and businesses are short on employees sometimes but we didn't even get a \"sorry for the wait\". Probably won't be returning for a while, at least."}
{"text":"Beware of take out orders this was my second time and once again my order got screwed up again / items were left because the staff didn't remember the complete order (you work there you should remember the complete orders better than me plus it's provided on the screen for you).....  when I called about my order the management team acted as if they did not even care !!!!!!! even when we were waiting for our order the management team looks as if they don't want to be there / then started giving the fakest smiles to people (as if they were counting the hours)!!!!!!! WOW !!!!!! your the manager what is that really saying to your staff ??????"}
{"text":"We ordered for a catering event. They had everything ready quickly and correctly. Desiree was extremely helpful and made sure that I received all of my points before finishing my order. Great place, staff and food."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week and then the service has been getting more bad every time! Twice we've waited for our server to bring us napkins , refills for over 10 minutes! I really wish I was exaggerating. I do see them just hanging around and it really is a bummer because I loved coming here to eat!    Update- I always eat at the bar now. Fernny and Madeline are awesome! They know our order and everything is always on when they serve us. They always greet us by name and chat with us."}
{"text":"2 stars because the food was pretty good, but I'd rate our service a 1. Came in for lunch with the girlfriend, when no one else was eating, so there's no excuse for poor service. We asked our server about her wing sauce recommendation and she did not have one. We ordered 15 wings w/ 3 different flavors, and they got 2/3 of them wrong. Fortunately they brought us out an extra 5 wings with one of the right flavors. Another server gave us 2 ranches before asking what dip we wanted, and j asked her for a blue cheese. She delivered it via a passive aggressive slide across the table. I said thank you and she walked away without a word or glance. When our server asked me if I wanted a refill of my lemonade, I said sure and she grabbed it and began walking off. I caught her before she managed to dip around the corner and asked if they were free refills, and she said no. I said she could've told me that, and she had no response and walked away. A clear attempt at racking up our bill with no sign of remorse when caught. Spinach dip was dank though."}
{"text":"The wings were nasty! The breading was simply cheap and not good. The Asian zing was sticky and tasted like Panda Express. Gag. HOWEVER, our server was TAYLOR. She was a doll. She was very accommodating and helped us drink into oblivion LOL. If it were for her, I'd give this location a \"0\""}
{"text":"Beverly our lovely and sweet server was very punctual and  informative about the dishes. Just her friendliness alone and excellent customer service makes me want to just come back.I felt very welcomed and warm. The mango habanero was my first choice and I tried the little mini corn dogs and a garlic fried mushrooms. It hit the spot."}
{"text":"Quiet night but happy BWW's was open on July 4th. The Buffalo Ranch Chicken sandwiches we ordered were enjoyable but typical pub fare. Happy they had an ample craft beer selection. The place was remodeled last year so it looks much nicer than when we were last here. But wow, if you sit in a booth the a/c blows right on you and you freeze! We moved to a table to get warmer. About what we expected overall so it turned out well."}
{"text":"I would be remiss if I did not shout out Alissa for her amazing customer service. My cousin and I stopped by for a few wings following my hooding ceremony.  We were shocked to learn that Alissa had only been working there for a few weeks.  She was extremely kind, attentive, and patient.   Much luck to you and all of your dreams, Alissa."}
{"text":"Nice place, good choices and the food is consistent.  Music can be a bit loud sometimes. And the place is loud during sporting events (UFC, NFL, MLB, etc.).  They also have the place set up for wireless and they even do a day for Fantasy Football drafting. There are also games that can be played while waiting."}
{"text":"Kamryn has great customer service! Food was ready quickly and she made sure everything was just right. I usually go to the one on Durango, but this one is definitely better."}
{"text":"Stopped by to watch the UFC fights and was impressed that we were able to find a table with plenty of TV'S around to get a good look at the fights. The food was average and the drinks were great witch probably made the food taste better than it actually was lol. In my mind the place is a bit over priced but still a great place to watch a sporting event."}
{"text":"Four stars!   Today, I had the pleasure of meeting up with several Yelpers, as well many of my friends, since it's my last week in the Phoenix area before my move to Las Vegas.  Today's mission? Drink, eat and watch Football! It was pretty busy, and why not? This is a cool place. I don't care if it's a chain. Good is good.  I am cutting our primary server quite a bit of slack because she put up with quite a bit (she had several tables scattered throughout the restaurant on a busy Sunday). I won't go into the details.  Here is where she really came through for me. I ordered Mango Habanero boneless wings and like a true wuss, they were too spicy for me. Yeah. Me. The Indian. Anyway, our server was kind enough to take them back, and brought me a replacement with a mild sauce so I could eat a proper meal.  My beers came out at the right temperature, and whenever I needed something, she was there to help me, no matter how distracted I seemed by all the games.  When it came time to pay up, she didn't mess up. We had a party of about 15-20 people over the course of the day and we never had to deal with the \"who ordered what\" because she automatically split our tabs up, without asking. She knew what was up.  When the evening progressed, and it slowed down, she even took some time to visit with us for a few minutes. This was AFTER we paid. So she wasn't doing this to get a higher tip. She was just a nice person.   Kudos to Amber.   A note for those who are like me and hate eating and drinking outside....this patio is perfect. Even on a 100 degree day. The patio is fully shaded and has plenty of misters. It's perfect.   If you want to read reviews about their wings, and the sauces, there are plenty of other 4 and 5 star reviews.   This place is awesome. Great place to watch sports. If you are in the area.  One last note. They have Pinnacle Whipped Vodka. You can get an Orange Julius Shot. It will touch your soul."}
{"text":"It was the irst time I came to this place and really enjoyed it... we were out for my bff's bday and I'm glad we ended up coming here, loved the food, our waiter John was very attentive and awesome!  GOOD JOB John!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite BW3 location. I come here time and time again for the quality food, great service, affordable prices, and fun atmosphere. My go-to is the Classic Chicken Wrap. The restaurant, like most in the chain, is split up into a more traditional dining area and then high tops over by the bar. There is an endless amount of TVs and trivia options.   Yesterday I dined around 3 or 4 p.m. and had a server named Sean. He was so conversational and even got my boyfriend and I samples of some seasonal beers. I wanted to give a special shoutout to Sean... My boyfriend unfortunately lost his grandpa earlier in the day, and your service made him so genuinely happy - which was great to see! Thank you again."}
{"text":"This location is built into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, and since we were on our way in, we decided to stop for food here first.  I had never tried macaroni and cheese from BWW, and they had an entrée that looked too good to pass up.  It came with some ranch tenders chopped up on top, and the crust on the mac n cheese had to have been made from crushed cheez-it's or something, because they were quite spectacular.  No complaints here on this trip, and service was good with a busy crowd."}
{"text":"Best place for wings and games! If there is football on thats where u will find me! Try the chillycheese frys"}
{"text":"Our server was Liz.. she is so awesome..my friends were a little annoying but she kept it cool the whole time... she makes you feel like you've known her for years... can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Went to BWW to watch the UFC fight. It was a giant cluster. They closed the restaurant and took down names for a first come, first serve seating to watch UFC. Problem was that the crowd building up to watch the fight swelled in the waiting area and poured out the front door, People were standing on top of each other waiting for a table. When they finally began trying to seat the crowd, they abandoned the list and started seating the crowd closest to the hostess stand. If and when they tried to call out a name on the list, no one could hear. It was complete caos. Very poorly handled by management and staff."}
{"text":"B-dubs is always good. But I had never been to this specific one. We were driving by the exit and decided this was a good place to get lunch. The food was good and the waitress was friendly. The host who seated us could have been more friendly and should have smiled. But other than that, no complaints"}
{"text":"Great priced happy hour food and drinks. Bartenders were very attentive and great conversation also"}
{"text":"ordered over the phone, told me it will take 20 mins, went there after 25 min but still waited 20 mins more, didnt even said sorry just made me sit there for 20 more min. they were eating food inside where everyone can see it, playing with sauces inside the kitchen service is very bad and rude"}
{"text":"24-hour wing place sounds good to me! customer service is A-ok. hit or miss sometimes.   food: i wish the wings were a little bit bigger!!!!!  MUST TRY THE Mango habenero!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is TERRIBLE!!! The wait staff is rude, lazy and SLOW.  It took 15 mins for someone yo take our drink order and another 15 for refills..."}
{"text":"I'm glad they reopened.  Good service, good food.  We're not really sports bar people but come here b'c the wings are dee-lish.  There's plenty of tables and booths and TVs though."}
{"text":"was there on a Monday night and it was SO DEAD. Went with a group of friends and when we all ordered, not only did our food arrive SUPER LATE, it also arrived COLD. My friend was so disappointed in her hard bread and cold fries the manager had to reheat it. My sweet potato fries honestly tasted like charcoal but I was too hungry to even complain. The wait was already long enough I didn't have the energy to do anything else."}
{"text":"Two starts for service, that's all.  It's a chain wing joint so my exceptions aren't great anyway. It's what you expect..mediocre beer selection, especially if you like good beer. Great beer selection if you are a fan of every cheap domestic variety. Typical poor quality, yet overpriced sports bar food. Restaurant reeks of sanitizer. Tons of TVs so you can watch a wide variety of televised sports. At least they have that going for them.  According to the name of the restaurant, wings should be the specialty and by the looks of the menu, you would think that they are. Wide variety of sauce or rub options - classic or boneless. All sauces I have tried have been good but be prepared to ask for extra on the side. The wings come out dry, dry, dry...overcooked and hardly any sauce on them at all. This place manages to screw up the one thing that they should have going for them.   Skip this place unless you like throwing your money away. There are other places in the general vicinity to get your sports watching on."}
{"text":"Stick with wings and you'll be fine. Everything else is on par with Red Robin at it's worst. Wings are great, I've tried just about every flavor. If you're in a hurry, these are the slowest wings you'll ever order. EVER. 20-30 minutes. I only order take out on Wing Tuesday. Order ahead...wait 30 minutes and you'll still wait. It's worth it. Better than making your own wings."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar, which is nearly impossible to eat at due to the video poker, and had a terrible experience. The bar staff was inattentive, lazy and overall horrible service. We tried waving at the bartenders but they ignored it - one bartender was leaning against the inside bar eating a meal (which should never be allowed) - and when they were ready they would go to one customer and handle it. They seems unable or unwilling to multitask and were working at snail speed when they wanted. We ordered the hottest wings they have, and we couldn't get water or beer refills. When I did finally get a water refill he only filled it halfway!! They never checked on us and ignored us when we tried to catch their attention. The manager happen to walk to the bar while we were waiting (forever) to close out, and we talked him about it but he wasn't interested in hearing it nor remedying the situation - I think he's more concerned with being friends with the staff than running a business. Overall, by far the worst Buffalo Wings I've ever been to in the country."}
{"text":"Food here is good we tried the boneless wings it was good to bad they charge for the ranch dressing other wise I would  give place 5 stars"}
{"text":"This is a great location. The staff is awesome and quick. Who doesn't love a good wing??"}
{"text":"Wings are good, BUT.... If you order them to go MAKE SURE YOU REQUEST THE FLAVORS SEPARATED!!!! They put 40 wings of 4 different flavors in one big pan, mixing hot with mild. I can't handle hot or spicy, so after my third wing, I was miserable. Don't let a lazy cook ruin your meal like he did mine."}
{"text":"This place has perfected the crispiness of chicken wings even though it's smothered in different flavors. Came here with friends and ordered a BWW Big Jack Daddy Burger. The sauce wasn't enough and the bun was chewy, although the fries were good. Will be sticking to their wings from now on, whether out of town or back home."}
{"text":"I really like coming here for lunch the people are always friendly and good service. Not always the fastest but I can let that slide. Except for one person. Joey! This is why you get one star. I have asked not to be seated with him on multiple occasions but when I dont ask...just my luck. Leaving the table when one person says that they are good when other people are sitting there with drinks. Not asking us if we are ready to order after taking our drinks. Snatching receipts out of peoples hands. One occasion me and another person ordered the buy one get one and the third person ordered the lunch special. He walked away without setting the timer so we did. Not explaining that the bogo isn't part of the 15 min lunch he walks by and stops the timer. One of use had the lunch that applied to it. So when it was over the 15 mins he still had to pay. Rude, disrespectful, and not task oriented at all. It always takes forever because he doesn't to his job in a productive manner. I don't know why he has been working there so long. I have said stuff to the manager multiple times? Is there no sociolinguistic observation and discipline for the wait staff?"}
{"text":"Thanks to Dan for not looking at me like an alien when I told him I had a certain diet I am suppose to abide by from my doctor for medical reasons. It's not celiac, but something different that also includes a gluten free diet. He was able to tell me all of the things on the menu which has little, to no gluten.  Thank you! I was able to enjoy the rest of my night because of your sincere service. We will be back again for more football and wings!"}
{"text":"#FAIL   If I could give negative stars, I would.  My husband, his co-worker and I stopped in for lunch about a month ago.  We all placed our orders at the same time, however, our food came out at different times.  I ordered a salad while my husband and his co-worker each ordered the wing/fries lunch combo.  My husband's co-worker's order came out in about 10 minutes, my salad came out about 10 minutes after and my husband's about 15 minutes after that... Ridiculous much? When our server brought out the second plate, even HE was surprised that we were still waiting on my husband's plate. He let us know that he had checked the time our orders were logged in and it had definitely been over 30 minutes.  He said he would notify the manager and have him come over to talk to us.  About 40 minutes into our meal, the manager comes over, says that he was made aware of the situation and then walked away... THAT'S IT. Seriously, that's it. No apologies, nothing... but we decided to let it go.  Yesterday we decided to give it another shot... horrible, horrible mistake.  We  placed our order and about 5 minutes later our wings come out - GREAT!  Needless to say, I was  extremely surprised so I asked the server if it was the correct table and he grabbed the basket of wings and said he would check.  He left and came back about 2 minutes later and confirmed that it was the right order, or so he tried to make us believe it was.  We had ordered the \"wild\" sauce and that is what the sticker read, which would have been right, but underneath that sticker was another one that read \"hot\".  Same wings as earlier before with different sticker? Most likely.  We had just gotten back from Flagstaff and were extremely hungry so we decided to let it go... again.  And this is how the rest went: The wings were cold and stale, our server forgot our plates, then the server forgot our fries and then he forgot the ketchup.  Oh, and my husband's beer came out about 15 minutes after it was ordered... NEEDLESS TO SAY, WE ARE VERY OVER THIS PLACE.  The wings are mediocre and the service is poor."}
{"text":"The only reason this review is 1-star is because Yelp forces you to give a rating. Had there been an option this would be 0-stars or a negative rating. Bar none the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. When we checked in we were told 10-15 minutes. We were seated an hour later. Roughly 1/3 of the tables were empty at all times. It took another 20 minutes for someone to take our order after we were finally seated then it was nearly 45 minutes past that when our food arrived. The ONLY reason we didn't leave was hungry children. I watched one employee take 9 minutes to clear a small table two people were sitting at. There were green/yellow BWW jerseys everywhere but no one had any sense of urgency or customer service. Once the food arrived it was just ok, barely ok in fact. Some warm, some cold, nothing spectacular. We never got refills. Our waitress never checked on us. If I were the owner or GM of this Westgate location I'd be sure the manager on duty on the night of 9/22/17 would no longer be employed by BWW. Needless to say my business is lost forever."}
{"text":"Its your average Buffalo Wild Wings.  Plenty of tv's, pretty good wings, and a decent tap list.  I honestly wasn't impressed, but they just opened so I'll give them that extra star.  Especially since the only other wing place around is East Coast WIngs and they aren't anything special either.  We were seated quickly on a Sunday right at 1pm.  Since there were only 2 of us they tried to put us on the sides or next to the wait station in the dining room at some very small tables.  We decided to go to the bar instead.  We were greeted quickly and told the specials.  Our waitress, Ashley, was pleasant, bubbly, and quite attentive.  We asked about specific recommendations on beers and I don't know if she knew the beer list that well as 2 of the best IPA's around were on tap and neither were mentioned when I asked about IPA's.  Lagunitas and Southern Tier are great.  Not knowing that, I ordered a Sweetwater 420.  Something wasn't right with it, so she poured me another one.  My counterpart ordered a bloody Mary that was horrible.  Tasted like V8 and nothing else.  Was supposed to be \"wild\"?  No spice, very little vodka.  We also ordered the tailgate sampler.  Great sampler per dollar.  4 wings, stuffed jalapeno's, pretzels, and pita points with artichoke dip.  I probably should have ordered more wings but otherwise no complaints.  It wasn't a bad experience, it just wasn't all that.  This place should do fine as a family style restaurant but doesn't seem to have the energy of a sports bar.  I'll be back again and again until something more legit comes to the Northlake area."}
{"text":"Another good day at Buffalo Wild Wings watching the Masters.  Watching sports and meeting new people is fun.  Great place and great atmosphere.  General Manager is the best."}
{"text":"Over an hour wait for food that never came. Very disappointing. I was going to complain to the manager but she was already getting an ear full from another customer."}
{"text":"Server rouyon worst customer service. He never came to check up on us if we're okay my daughter had to get up and ask him to get us napkins and myself get up to ask for the tab did not make sure we were okay once! I am myself a manager at a salon so I know customer service and my husband a server so I know abnout tips myself  But this guy wow sad I did spoke to the manager kind women didn't want nothing free just to speak to him, and what he did wrong. So he won't do that to another family"}
{"text":"The service is just severely lacking. Having to flag down your server to order, to get a refill, to get a box, to pay. It's just too much. And it wasn't in an impatient way. We waited and waited but he wouldn't come back or would bypass us over and over. The food was decent. We were watching a game but others wanted soccer so they changed the big screen. Just eh."}
{"text":"They have my favorite Pittsburgh beer on tap ... Full Pint Brewery Chinookie IPA. Food is enjoyable as well. Service is prompt but not overbearing. A likable sports bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Bdubbs honestly? Asian Zing is my favorite. Well done traditional. I can eat it almost every day."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to eat after work. We sat down at a booth and noticed a funky smell so we told the server (Ryan) and we switched booths. We got our drinks and my friend needed a refill we noticed a dirty table that the server had come from with my friends refill. He did not have the soda in a pitcher but in a cup with a straw in it. The server poured the cup of soda into my friends cup. My friend whose cup was getting refilled said \"I hope he did not pour me someone else cup into my cup.\" As the server walks away with the cup he had refilled my friends cup with, we notice him drink out of the cup! His mouth was touching the cup! My friend complained to different server and  she came with a sprite in a new cup. The server came to our table \"Which one of you brain dead idiots told the server that I drank out of your cup.\" And continued to argue, personally working in a restaurant I know for the sake of customer service that the manager should have stepped in to apologized and changed servers."}
{"text":"We like coming to this location. It's always busy, but we never have to wait long for a table. All the servers we have had were great. Food comes out fast and the happy hour goes until 7:00. This is our permanent stop for wings!"}
{"text":"First off I love chicken wings.  I cook and eat them very often.  When you are on a low carb diet trying to lose a few pounds (from all the buffets I have eaten over the years lol)  meat starts looking unappealing after awhile, so I usually turn to chicken wings during these trying times.  Because I cook them so much I have mastered them.  They are quite easy,  Split them, deep fry them at 375 to 400 and coat them in a sauce made with Butter and Cayenne Hot sauce.  So simple my 6 year old son can do it.  No joke.  How does Buffalo Wild Wings fuck this up?    I will tell you how.  No love and terrible tasting sauces.  First thing what kind of chicken did these wings come off of?  A BUZZARD?  They are fucking huge.  And they just taste weird.    These FRANKENSTEIN WINGS are more than double the normal size of a chicken wing.  So of course they overcooked in order to get somewhat crispy.  Naturally that just makes the meat dry and tough.  Second, when the wing is hot you pull it out of the fryer and toss it in the sauce.   Seems like here they just put them in a paper basket and pour cold thick sauce on top that tastes like over salted cheap vegetable oil, defiantly NOT BUTTER..  It complements the BUZZARD meat well considering that meat tastes like it was soaked in some kind of salt water brine to plump them up..   Hungry yet?  So you say screw it I will just dip the wing in some ranch to drown out the terrible taste and dryness of the wing.   Well guess what.  That ranch isn't fresh ranch, it is that cheap shit you buy at the store in the non fridge section that tastes like Corn Syrup and once again cheap oil.  YUM.  Sounds delicious huh?   Yeah it isn't.  Now couple all that and charge 20 bucks for 20 wings and you got Buffalo Wild Wings.   Congratulations Columbus Ohio (yes original Buffalo Wild Wings was first there) you took something amazing created in Buffalo New York and just SHIT all over it...  You have been warned."}
{"text":"The service was as good ad their food. I got this potato wedges and they were really good. Wings large and juicy."}
{"text":"Edible bar food.  Odd pricing on drinks when large beers are cheaper than the smaller size.  Don't sit in the bar if decent service is a requirement."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an upset stomach, being put into a bad mood and a waste of money this is definitely your spot! Unbelievably bad customer service and the restaurant is often poorly cleaned. Food is obviously frozen and microwaved and is irrationally overpriced and honestly just a horrific meal. \"Bdubs\" is the reason that chain restaurants give people a bad image in these types of establishments you can find in each time. Been here several times (regretful) and is very difficult to recall a time where I wasn't dissatisfied and frankly, pissed off"}
{"text":"First off let me say that being from the states this is not my first Buffalo Wild Wing experience. I've been to BWW's in Laughlin NV, Cleveland, OH and Hawthorne, CA so I knew what I was getting myself into. They have fabulous deals on wings, .60 wing day is Tuesdays - for Original Wings, they have like 30 sauces to choose from (Mango Habenero and Sweet Kicking Honey are our favorites), and Primo Margaritas to die from (and we are HUGE margarita snobs).  Mary always takes great care of us, and we love the staff and the sports bar type ambiance. They have the little trivia/poker machines at the tables which are always fun.  Typically it keeps us hanging around and drinking for awhile. I highly recommend these guys - their salads are GREAT too, quality food at a reasonable price.  These are delicious big and meaty wings too - not low quality crap. ;) give them a try and you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This place is no better than a garbage dump.  We waited over 40 minutes for a very simple order.  I will only speak for myself.  I ordered a salad and wings.  First, the salad came out with the wings.  Wrong!  The salad comes out first.  Service 101 dopes.  Well, the salad was wrong on top of that.  I asked for no onions or croutons.  The salad had both.  Then my wings were room temp.  The sauce was glazed over as if they were sitting out for an hour.  I spoke to the manager about this and she said she would get me another order.  I said no and that I won't send food back.  I asked to just take the crap away and take it off my bill.  She responded by telling me I must watch 60 minutes.  I said no, and asked again to just take them off the bill.  She argued with me 2 more times about letting them try again.  She said she'd make them herself.  I finally won the battle and got them and the salad removed from my bill.  BWW sucks!!!    -Pete"}
{"text":"Horrible service! When you order take out says will be ready in 10 and it's not ready  and it takes 30 min. Asked for extra wet comes out extra dry and then you tell the manager Aaron and he comes back and then drowns them in sauce to be a sarcastic ass whole. And then the food all still comes out cold"}
{"text":"We love b-dubs!    Been to this location many times, both in the dining room and at the bar. Always great food, great service.  More drink and food specials would be awesome..."}
{"text":"Nope. Service: prompt and friendly. Beer cold and the best thing about the place.  Decor/Ambience: like the TV section of Walmart + beer.  Ugly,  uncomfortable wood/metal chairs, formica tables. The front room has carpet flooring, which always skeeves me out at a restaurant. Lots of big TV's, showing lots of sports.  Food: Blah.  I ordered some sort of salad with chicken; was dismal. OK so maybe you shouldn't order a salad at a sports bar; that thought did cross my mind. But my BF ordered their \"specialty combo\" which is basically wings and fries. He said it was terrible. Fries were cold and hard, the slaw was MIA, wings were depressing. Nothing we ate was worthwhile. Prices aren't even good.  Would have gotten higher quality food from almost any fast food chain."}
{"text":"Good service  a little pricy if your on a budget bit great wings great service lots of beer"}
{"text":"Horrible service on top them not getting my to-go orders correct ever. I mean ever. I will drive further to the one at westgate to be treated better"}
{"text":"Where do I start..... Great winds and great beers..  The atmosphere here is always fantastic.... Live sports are on, place is usually packed with people....   Honey bbq traditional wings are a must here, one of the best flavors they have, you can also purchase most of the sauces to take home and try it your self. Which I've done in the past. Great beers on tap, I like the different varieties they have.... They have Wings on promotion for $.69 on Tuesdays, can't beat that deal..... Eat up and enjoy."}
{"text":"BWW is the worst place ever, location doesn't matter it's all equally shit service. Especially at this location since they opened it has always been a shit show inside. Rude rude rude employees, especially the pick up order area lady. Always wrong order, always late, always rude, missing napkins and silverware, we just ordered a meal $50 and they forgot about it. I work across the street and this is BS. 0 stars if possible. Re structure the management to get the ball rolling. Horrible always forget the cheese on burger, boneless wings when I ask for traditional, etc. just horrible."}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday with 2 of my Co-workers. I was met at the door by a young lady welcoming us to the establishment. Our waiter was great and the food was AWESOME (Order off of their lunch menu). However this is the reason I am giving them three stars. It greaves my soul to walk onto an eating establishment and see a you lady with a RED velcro head wrap on her head. I understand if she had it on walking into work however while working this shouldn't be allowed."}
{"text":"I ordered online the other day and all went smoothly. When I went to get the order the girl serving me was awesome! Usually when we go and sit down the service is hit or miss. On sunday when I picked up my order the girl who helped me was awesome. She was really friendly. She went over my whole order with me and got me a discount! She was spot on. As for the parking at this location it sucks because of the UHaul. There never seems to be any parking anymore. The UHaul has taken it over compleately."}
{"text":"This will be a short review... when BWW came out, I really liked their wings. But over the years it seems like they've moved into cooking their wings and then just splashing sauce on them as you order them. This is OK, so long as you know this is what you are getting.  On a side note - I am allergic to the Caribbean Jerk. LOL."}

If you go with children be sure to see if they have any of their gaming systems available. They are good to keep the kids entertained while you eat or watch a game.  On a side note - I am allergic to the Caribbean Jerk. LOL."}
{"text":"Standard hipster hangout.  Food is below average but they try to make up for it with atmosphere.  Fail.  If you want to have your lunch or dinner with a bunch of hipsters trying to remain relevant, then you might want to hang out here.  Just my opinion, bring a bag lunch."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this location for months and we're never returning to this location again! This is our SECOND bad experience. The first time we had a bad experience, our appetizer (we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip) came out crusty from the top, as if it's been sitting there for a while. Today, as soon as we walked in we saw the employees, which I assumed were hosts sitting down in the waiting area because of how slow they were. We ordered the same appetizer today and the dip was definitely fresh this time but they gave us tortilla chips, which on the menu it says it comes with pita chips. Not a big deal, we ate them anyway. Our waitress, Christina, when we began to order our food gave us a dirty look as if we were inconveniencing her, she also didn't bother check up on us throughout our dining (keeping in mind that it's REALLY slow and there's probably only two other parties dining) and brought us refills AT THE END when we had already finished our food. We also ordered fries and we never got them, but we were charged for them! Obviously we told her and she apologized and said \"why didn't you tell me\", well it's kind of difficult to tell you if you didnt even bring us our food and you're no where to be visible nor check up on us. We went in on a Tuesday expecting to get the 1/2 traditional wings which is promoted on the BWWs website. When we got our bill we asked her about it and she told me \"well we don't do that here,\" and i told her that it's on the BWWs website and then called her manager over. The manager, very polite proceeded to tell me that the 1/2 traditional wings on Tuesday's is only for franchise stores and not for corporate stores. This is by far the worst experience and I do not recommend this location! Take the extra time and go to the one on hualapai, as they actually give you discounts and the service is MUCH better!"}
{"text":"We used to love coming here. But then BWW changed their wing set up and pricing. Now it's super expensive and the wings are teeny tiny. Wait staff is usually angry."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of wings, so I ordered chicken strips. I was really impressed with the quality. Really crunchy and tasty! This place really earns stars for me because of the fried pickles and cheese curds - my two favorites at one place! And they have beer. Come for happy hour and save a few bucks. It is pretty loud in here, so be prepared for that. Service is so-so."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened but I was told it's Bw3 thins to Poor your draft beer a 1/2in short of being full. It's not like there not make $$ on their kegs that cost them pennies to fill. It's BS to shortchange a customer like that!! Pay attention next time you go and your draft beer will be short!"}
{"text":"I had a HORRIBLE day and nothing was going right.  I was supposed to meet up with friends here, but my car battery died along with another whole string of events that I will spare you...the dear waiter had heard of all the atrocities that had happened to me and offered to pick me up on his break and guaranteed I would have a better day.  I toted my butt in a cab over and everyone was way ahead but having a blast.  Matt our waiter was fantastic, but unfortunately as I arrived it was time for him to clock out.  He was very charming and funny though; you are lucky if you have him as a server.    Matt was replaced by Macy who was also a doll and kept the draft beer flowing.  She hooked me up with two flavors of wings on my small order and gave me a huge bowl of celery to lap up the yummy sauces.    Unfortunately my 49ers lost, and they had huge big screens to remind me of that!  Haha!  All and all this is a good sports bar, lots of TVs, big bar, great specials, and outstanding service.  My wings were just okay and seemed a bit pricey to me, but the beer was cheap to make up for it.  I will definitely be back for beer and sports because the service was impeccable and it is close to home!"}
{"text":"went here last week and the server was very rude and when I talked to her about it she acted like she didn't care.   I guess I can spend my money other places."}
{"text":"Great location. The food was satisfying. However the customer service was not up to par. I ordered online at 11:45 and despite it saying my food would be ready at 12:10 my food was not ready until 12:24. When I entered the location I was not acknowledged. They did not say what was going on with the food or apologize for the wait. I had to request forks, napkins, ranch dressing, and my drink that came with my food. There tone and demeanor at this location is just not friendly or welcoming."}
{"text":"My family and I had a great time at Buffalo Wild Wings. I ordered the \"Big Daddy Burger\" and it was pretty good. My wife ordered to \"Po Boy\" and loved it. The sandwich was filled with shrimp, they put a good portion on shrimp. It will be ordered again."}
{"text":"Rachel makes it 5 stars, even on a super crowded n crazy UFC night like tonight! Great food, even better service. Not too much room to move around ounce it gets crowded though."}
{"text":"We went to Buffalo wild Wings on FLW Blvd in Scottsdale for my sons birthday. We frequently have discussions about who has the best wings, and tonight BWW would have my vote. But that's not why I am giving them a 5 star review.   We had 9 people in our party and our waitress Sam, did an incredible job. She was not only attentive but also cheerful, outgoing, helpful, and spot on when it came to our order. While you would think these attributes are to be expected in the hospitality industry, it is far too often not the case. What seams to be the norm now days is a sense of entitlement when it comes to gratuity. The waiter and/or waitress expect a 20% gratuity, which I am happy to pay when the service warrants it. My wife and I are both from the restaurant business. I put myself through college on tips so I understand the potential and also the value of good service. In this case, Sam did an excellent job, so much so I believe it is worth taking the time to acknowledge it. The food was served hot, in a timely manner, and everyone received exactly what they ordered.   Thank you to BWW and Sam for making my son's birthday experience a great one."}
{"text":"Service is getting bad after a couple years. Relatively been ignored multiple visits, and have never been offered a water refill after the glass being empty for 20 minutes. The food's still good, but I take back what I said of relatively good service. Depending on the night I wouldn't expect much..."}
{"text":"We went for a snack during my brother's bachelor party.  Derrick, the server was a real friendly guy.  The food was as expected.  However, in going over all of our finances for the weekend (we're splitting them as a group), I came across my BWW receipt and charge at the bank.  This may be an honest mistake, but my writing was definitely clear on the receipt: they charged me an extra dollar more than I wrote in for.  An extra dollar for me, especially when splitting amongst the group? That's not a big deal...curious however if this is a common thing and they're Office Spacing it $1 at a time."}
{"text":"There was no waitress when we came in even though the place was totally empty. When she finally came around the corner, she sat us in a gross booth that was busting out the seams. Also, wall outlets are all cracked and busted too. Place doesn't look too clean."}
{"text":"I had a semi bad experience here. First off we waited about 20 minutes to be seated. I ordered cheese sticks to offset the waiting time because we ordered chicken and it didnt matter, as everything came out together. Part of the order was wrong, so we eat our cheese sticks and popcorn shrimp only. We decided to cancel the rest of the order since it took 35 minutes to get our food in the first place. The waitress gave us drinks when we first arrived but failed to check on us for refills....I ended up slurping my lemon water to the very bottom. I will not be coming back here for least 6 months as I will drive the extra miles to another BWW to get better service!"}
{"text":"Stale food and slow service ~  How is it possible to have better take out food then dining in? We've been getting take out from here and usually it's good. Not great by any means but sometimes my man needs some wings in his life.   Tonight we decided to dine in and unfortunately it was all down hill. For starters the restaurant is filthy. Tables aren't being cleaned off and trash all over the floors. There's a lot of people who work here but nobody cares to clean it up and make it look presentable.   The girl who served us was very nice but didn't pay attention to drinks being down to nothing and we had to ask several times for refills.   The food was the major disappointment. The only thing that tasted very good were the cheese curds that came out nice and hot. The wings tasted stale and everything was over breaded on the them and the veggies were really old.   It's a fun & loud atmosphere but nobody is paying attention to the details. Too bad :("}
{"text":"OK, I'm writing a third and final update. The manager of this location reached out to me after my first review, and while I didn't respond, I can actually tell that action was taken. The food wait times have significantly decreased, and the service has gotten better. How's that for customer service? Post a bad Yelp review and changes will happen. Good job, manager and BW3 staff. We come in frequently again, and as I mentioned in the last review, the cheese curds are absolutely to DIE for (and awesome because they are relatively low in carbs which means I can eat them! Yay! Thanks for listening, BW3s management!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with my bf, I ordered my wings crispy, they weren't crispy... my bf ordered a salad, they guy forgot his salad dressing, and he said he would be right back with it. It had then been 10/15 min we didn't get the dressing so I told him and he literally Ran to the back to get some. Other then these few things that bugged me, everyone seemed to be hanging around talking and not doing there job."}
{"text":"Great place to relax and unwind or even watch the game with friends. Great menu with almost anything you can ask for. Wings are their bread and butter so you know they will be above average. Great location in the middle of Westgate Mall and close to about anything you want."}
{"text":"The service is awesome, you don't get sides with your wings is the only down side to this place, our food was fresh and hot"}
{"text":"Love Buffalo Wild Wings!  Where have you been all my life?  $3 happy hour from 2PM -7PM and 10PM -6AM.  Monday to Friday.  They are open 24 hours to cater to everyone, especially people working in the hospitality and restaurant industry.  Get the Asian Sesame wings.  They are both savory and spicy!  This Sport's Bar is located 5 mins from the Las Vegas Casinos if you have a car.  Great service and great wings!  They even let us borrow their Android charger, while we were watching the NBA finals.  They also have a restaurant that caters to children and families.  Will go again next time I'm in Vegas! Woot!"}
{"text":"Two stars is being pretty generous here. If it weren't for my son being obsessed with buffalo wings I'd never step foot in this place. I shiver when he asks to go but he's 8. He ate dirt once as a toddler. It's a slow progression on his palate apparently. Gotta give in sometime. The service is usually slow. There always seems to be one server for every table and 12 more standing around. I've decided to bring in my own bottle of soda next time do I won't die of thirst waiting for refills. For how much they over charge for crap in a paper boat I'd expect them to at least cook the food. I'm pretty positive the appetizer platters are pre assembled, frozen and popped in the microwave when ordered. I've decided that the only safe thing to order is a side salad. Otherwise be prepared to be nauseous within 2 hrs. I just don't understand why people love this place and how they stay in business."}
{"text":"Service was excellent!!!! Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks filled at all times. She also made sure plenty of napkins were on the table (very important at a wing spot). Another person and a manager came by and allowed us to try sauces (7 of them). There was a big crowd for the World Cup game but food was still out in a timely manner. Great spot!"}
{"text":"The sliders were overcooked and the fries were soggy. The sauce is good but the  wings were dry as a chicken bone. Way overcooked and chewy like leather. Unless we can find a better wing joint we may return here. Never been a big fan of BW3."}
{"text":"Good place to eat. Hate getting charged for extra ranch and sauce."}
{"text":"I met a buddy for lunch and some beers the other day at BWW's.  Though I truly do not understand the allure of this place, it's patrons pack the parking lot during the evening times.  I gave up on the name sack (Wings) many moons ago and when I have eat at Buffalo's I get the tenders.  Prefab in every sense of the word and the more breading than meat nuggets taste almost almost fake to me,   If your into over priced cheap food served in a loud environment  with lot's of TV's then this is the place."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar as usual and enjoyed the Tuesday's wings special with a porter. The service from the barmaid was less than poor and was not too impressed with her attitude. She would have received a good tip if she had some interest in her customers."}
{"text":"Went there Friday night. The wings were good. The bartenders were friendly and they had a good happy hour ($3 cocktails and domestics.) Me and the hubby played some trivia which I had never done before at a place like that with their little devices. It was my first time to a BWW and I would go back."}
{"text":"A+, great service.  Fresh hot food, cold beer.  Hot and hot bbq wings.  Mac and cheese for kids.  Tom was a great waiter.  Zero complaints!  Thanks for a great family night!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service from here last night.  My husband and I walked in around 12:15 am and there was only one bartender by the bar.  We sat down at the bar and did not receive a greeting.  After waiting about 10 minutes we still received no menus or any acknowledgement.  The bartender then proceeded to walk back to the kitchen.  He did see us then and said he would be right back to help us.  After waiting maybe another 5-10 minutes the bartender still had not returned so we left.  Worse service ever!"}
{"text":"bad experience. We had a larger group (13) but that should not matter. We had one server, Travis, who was rude and whose service was terrible. Of course our out of town guests did not receive their food when the rest of the group did  and we had to get the the manager involved just to finally get the food. It really ruined the meal portion of the night. Unfortunate"}
{"text":"Where to start? They opened 2 days ago and the place is buzzin and the word is out!  It's same setup as most other Buffalo Wild Wings, but seems a lot more space and room in bar area with table tops.  I met and spoke with Manager Chris already who was really nice.  Managers, servers and bartenders all on the spot!   As for entertainment, they have tons of HD tv's in varying sizes (see my uploaded pics) , Golden Tee, Big Buck HD, Buzztime (like NTN) and a juke box.    It's your standard menu and amazing food as you'd come to expect from Buffalo Wild Wings.   Now let me tell you about their Happy Hours!  Yes, Happy Hours! 2-7pm! and reverse happy hour 10pm until close! $3 tall 22 oz domestic beers, Capt & Cokes, Jack & Cokes, Absolut and mixers.  And get this, with the drinks at Happy Hour here they offer $3 Mozzarella sticks, Salted garlic mushrooms, Chili con queso dip, Mini corn dogs, onion rings, and chips and salsa.  What a deal!   So far they have yet to lay their loyalties to any teams outside of the Cardinals and the key matchup of the weekend for NFL on Sunday per the manager but he did say the GM is a Bears fan so my guess is you'll be seeing them on many tv's come Sunday. Da Bears!  I definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"So not the best night at BWW.  We are from Irvine, CA and frequent the Irvine location often.  Thought it would be perfect for our large group of 9 people.  It took literally over 15 minutes for someone to say hi.  I asked for a manager and 5 min later someone came.  The server made a bad attempt to blame the host for seating people too quickly but he still could have acknowledged us and said he'd be back in a few min.   The food we got was ok but my mom never even got her food and my dad never got his side.  I had to go to the bartender to get the sauces we ordered (she was great and got them quickly). When we finally told the server to forget my mom's meal and just get our check he never got it.  I went back to the bar and found a manager (in a blue shirt) and he was extremely apologetic and got the main manager.  FINALLY a manager came to our table.  He apologized blaming the busy night for the service.  But.. there were still open tables around us.  I cut him off and said please just get our check.  They redeemed themselves by comping the check but I can tell you that we would have rather paid for our check than have the experience we had.  My mom never got her food so my dad was gonna run her thru Carl's Jr.  on the way home.  Oh forgot to mention, we were celebrating my mom's and daughter's bday.  Needless to say we never even got to order them dessert."}
{"text":"They were basically out of all the good beers and apps. Service was slow. Overall just not the best Buffalo Wild Wings out there."}
{"text":"Went in on a Thursday for boneless wings and BAM! To my crazy surprise they were on special (apparently every Thursday) for 70¢ a piece! I like variety so I got 4 different sauces. There's a 4 minimum for each sauce which is totally understandable. Took em home and had a grand old time! Oh and they have Lagunitas Lil Sumpin' Sumpin' on draught. Deeeeeliciious! Todd, the bartender was very helpful too!"}
{"text":"Food is as you would expect, but the service leaves a lot to be desired.  Staff is generally very young, with most in the 18-25 range.       I don't like the atmosphere, so most of my orders are take-out.  Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to have the order to take 10-20 minutes longer than the listed time on your online receipt.  Last order was on a Thursday night after the dinner rush.  it started out fifteen minutes late; after checking in again, I was told they were waiting on the mozzarella sticks.  I wasn't sure why it would take an extra fifteen minutes to deep fry some cheese, but whatever.  Ten minutes later (that's 25 minutes after the time on my receipt), the order finally came.  When I got home, all of the food was lukewarm, including the \"fresh\" mozzarella sticks.  The sticks were also missing their jar of marina sauce; however, one had a dab of marina on it for some reason.  Couldn't figure out what happened.  Did they give me somebody's extra?  Gross."}
{"text":"Never coming here again! Dirty place! Table next to us been dirty since we got here. Food is taking too long been waiting for 40 mins and still waiting while writing this.  While restaurant is empty only 2 tables!!! My drink bloody Mary full of Tabasco is done. My 2 boys are tired of waiting. I don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"When you walk in the door there are usually 2 or 3 young ladies there to greet you and direct you to a table. A great start but then the service starts to unravel.      This is where we stop after golf to sit and rehash our game and complain about the many reasons we shot 92 instead of 72! The greens were bad, the sand traps too big etc. We need a little attention, a cold beer and a little sympathy. There appear to be a lot of staff running around or standing in groups of 2's and 3's but no one seems to be in a hurry to come over to your table. It is not uncommon to wait at least 5 minutes or longer before someone decides you may need to order.   I do have to admit that once you do order, the food comes very quickly and I highly recommend that you try some of the various dry rubs, my favorite is the salt and vinegar wings.      When the restaurant first opened, the manager was approaching customers asking   how they enjoyed the food. I said the food was great but having to sit there without getting any service was a problem. I was told that customers should have a server at their table within 45 seconds of getting seated. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT PLAN!  I think they should have little free standing flashing yellow strobe lights in the middle of the table and when you get seated it starts flashing and continues until a server comes over shuts it off and takes your order!  I might even bring my own and see if it works!!  Don't get me wrong, this is a good sports bar with very good wings, cold beer, and lots of TV's so if you don't mind being ignored for the first 5 minutes give it a try, or .....bring your own yellow flashing light (I bet it will work!)!"}
{"text":"Waiter was sweet but wtf it was empty and I still waited for like 45 minutes for 5 wings! Omg"}
{"text":"Not too bad. Ordered take out. Wings were ready and hot. Staff seemed friendly. Looks like lots of TV's. Might have to check this place out later during a game.  Wings weren't overly battered. Medium buffalo sauce was good. True to original buffalo flavour. Just as good as St. Louis. Maybe even a little better."}
{"text":"As someone who grew up in Texas, BW3s is the go-to spot to watch sports, enjoy wings, cold bear and great service. This weekend I learned that a Las Vegas BW3s experience is very different (except for our server...he was great)  A few other things to note:  1. It took 20 minutes before a server gave me a menu or took a drink order.  2. I noticed one server on the other side of the restaurant was attentive with his guests, so I picked up and moved to his station. Within 2 minutes, Brian gave me a menu and took my drink order. If I every return it will be because Brian was a terrific server.  3.  I was not prepared for all of the football games to be turned off the big screens in favor of an MMA fight.   Needless to say,  I will try another sports bar next weekend."}
{"text":"This place is straight cheeks. Our food was supposed to be ready at 8:10 and we arrived at 8:15. They told us out order was being bagged. Then we waited for about 20-30 minutes standing there and waiting, figured they were making the food still. Everything was all well and good at home until... wtf is this, one of our wings still had feathers on it!!! This was the most absolutely disgusting thing I have ever seen. Nobody at the table could finish their food and my brother almost threw up. They probably checked to see if the order was to-go and said oh it's whatever they'll be gone anyways. Never again will I be seen eating Buffalo Wild Wings. Save you and your family and eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this one IS THE WORST BWW we have ever been too!!! The service is AWFUL!!! No respect, no professionalism what's so ever! The waitress OMG that waitress we had was so damn rude!!! We spoke with the manager Chris who was nice and asked us to give them another chance and also provided us with the DM phone number (Bob).  Well we decided to give them another chance (bad decision on our part) and what do you know the moment we sat down the waiter didn't even come greet us  so about 15 min later this other waitress took our table because he never came and went off on her right in front of us because he said he had enough tables and he WAS NOT going to help us!!!! To make matters worse we called the district manager left message and he never returned our call...explains the staff they hire if that's the type of upper management Buffalo Wild Wings hires!!! Never Again!!!"}

{"text":"Best b-dubs I've ever been to, service-wise. I placed an order online and accidentally sent it to the wrong store. The staff was awesome about it: they even called the other store to let them know that I wouldn't be coming. I opted to wait at this location to get my food, and multiple staffers offered me drinks and assured me that this happens ALL the time. Having two restaurants off of \"William ... highway\" is super confusing, so I feel slightly less bad about my error. Regardless, they were awesome and any place that handles service issues like this deserves a great review."}
{"text":"Okay, they redesigned the eating area which reflects other BWW.  So far the new arrangement is easier to get around and the staff is better at cleaning up the area.  That statement comes from not understanding how families can bring in their kids to let them make a mess of the table and floor without picking up the mess their kids made.  Don't bring your kids unless they can behave.   Drinks can be a little slow at getting to your table and not sure why.  Does the staff wait too many tables at one time?   We love the jamming jalapeno and parmesan garlic sauce on the boneless wings.  Good place to go late at night when you need a good meal."}
{"text":"I loved this place when I was in high school, and I don't have a specific reason why I stopped coming. I always knew the wings were solid, better than say Wingstop. But I came back this weekend with just too many things wrong.  The order was fried pickle appetizers, while I ordered medium wings with both medium and spicy garlic sauce, plus a side of bacon and cheese wedges. Weird thing was the menu change. I remember ordering per wing, now it's just Snack-Small-Medium-Large, which all mean nothing to me. I just hoped ordering more still meant cheaper per wing.  Pickles had a good bite from the cornmeal crust, but rest of the meal was pretty bad. The wedges blasted way too long, so the cheese formed a super hard crust and you couldn't separate anything. Also I don't remember a snack size being over 6 bucks. The wings were oversalted, and if you did the math it was basically 2 dollars a wing, even at a medium plate.  Something's different now. I don't know if they're giving me less or charging me more, but this meal was about $5-10 more expensive then I remembered. Probably not coming back despite the memories."}
{"text":"I ordered the combo plate with honey BBQ ribs and sweet BBQ traditional wings.  The wings were good, the sauce was good, the ribs were sub par.  They taste like the ribs at Applebee's, which I consider bottom of the barrel variety.  So if you go here, stick to the tried and true wings and nothing else.  In my opinion, they're not as good as The Chicken Shack or Hooters, but I'm still set on coming back and trying the boneless wings next time.  UPDATE: After a bout of insomnia, I came here at 3 in the morning to get my chicken wing fix (it's open 24 hours, conveniently enough)...  I decided to try the boneless wings (i.e. fingers) with the teriyaki sauce.  Unfortunately, I found the strips too crispy and dry and the glaze unbearably strong.  Oh well, I know for next time...  STICK WITH THE TRADITIONAL WINGS ONLY."}
{"text":"My worst experience at Buffalo Wild Wings.  This is the second time that I've come here and they've gotten my order wrong and not rectified it.  I would NOT recommend this location to anyone, but I will recommend the location in Surprise as I've had excellent service at that location.  We ordered, and I ordered a medium boneless wings, half asian zing and half salt and vinegar.  When the order came, the waitress dumped the food on the table and I had gotten traditional wings, but 7/8 of the plate was asian zing, and only about 3-4 pieces were salt and vinegar.  Our waitress never checked on us until she came with the bill.  I explained that I didn't order traditional, I ordered boneless and that most of the plate was asian zing.  She then appeared with a bill with both the  boneless and the traditional wings, and a military discount, which was totally wrong.  I met with the MOD, and she took the traditional off, but she should have gave me half off the order for the order coming with 1) traditional wings and 2) they were not boneless.  She couldn't see the point and by this time I was boiling so I just paid the bill, but I guarantee you, I will smear their name all over social media.  I'm not sure if the restaurant reads these reviews, but let me tell you, your customer service needs a lot of work.  Unless I see anything in the future, I will NOT recommend this location to ANYONE."}
{"text":"Typical buffalo wild wing. A little bigger than normal . Got seated quickly only to have 5 servers walk past us. 3 of which sat and had a conversation what tables they had or didn't. We where the next table over. Waited about 8 minutes until walking out. Servers all seem to be more into talking to each other than working."}
{"text":"Fried cheese curds were amazing. Bartender was attentive and friendly. Tv's everywhere you look food an drink times weren't long. Great place to grab drinks and food while watching the game."}
{"text":"Few franchises have the honor of being college anti-munchies food. Ever since I discovered the BWW here, that number has gone up by one for me. A nice break from the simple food joints that Champaign loves to love; once in a while, the corporate-smeared spicy garlic buffalo wing sauce is exactly what one craves.  I'd also like to say that BWW has participation as a campus venue. Frequent wing-eating contests and even a tournament in the Greek system solidifes my opinion of BWW in this location as a 5-star Chambana location!"}
{"text":"service was nice, but disappointed to learn their kitchen cross contaminates their \"dedicated fryer\" and can not guarantee Gluten Free.  Why claim GF if there kitchen won\"t comply???   It isn't that hard and I view that as poor management.  BEWARE CELIAC people... stay away from BWW!  We walked..."}
{"text":"If you are not into loud noise and sports definitely not your place but if you are in the mood for great wings (especially the boneless options) Buffalo Wild Wings is an awesome choice.  Today we felt a little crazy so upped our heat on the wings and went for the habernaro mango boneless wings.  They were quite good.    So far very few wing flavors we have tried have been bad.  The waitress was impressed we did not think the habernaro wings were hot so dared us to try the blazing hot sauce.  Up for the challenge she brought us out some and dipped the medium wing into it.  Was definitely hot and I probably could not eat more than 1 but next time we are going to give those a shot.  The asian zing wings are awesome and the $3.25 large beer special today was a nice side."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this place ever again. We had a party of 5 and 2 of them were children. I ended up getting these poor babies there drinks after 45 minutes of waiting. Food was cold and not that great. There were only 2 waitress working the porch and it was packed!! We walked out not paying the bill, come to find out we were not the only party to do that on the same night."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel across the street. Waited all day to watch Cavs vs. LAC. I went in at 10:30 and to my surprise they had 100 TVs all watching UNC vs Duke. No biggie, I get it. Place was pretty much empty and the host said he can turn to the game. I sat there for 10 mins waiting meanwhile watching him F off. Eventually I went up to him and said remember me. He's like sir your gonna have to be patient. An argument ensued and he's like sir your gonna have to find another place to eat. I hadn't had a drink, just waiting for them to turn to a different game. He was wrong for that."}
{"text":"This would be a great place to watch a game. The food is kinda overpriced...but decently good. The traditional wings are my favorite, Asian Zing and Medium with a side of Ranch!   If you're going to order an appetizer, stick with the fried pickles. They're the only thing that's marginally different from something you could get pretty much anywhere else."}
{"text":"Bad customer service bad listening skills. Request things here and you better check your food before you leave. Go to hooters the bad wings you get there are actually better than the bad wings you'd get from this location at least you'll get your bad order right at hooters and a nice view to boot"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! We arrived early to ensure a table for the eagles playoff game. The restaurant wasn't busy to our surprise. We were a party of 6 and when we were seated, they sat us in the corner of the restaurant. We asked to sit in another part of the restaurant so my son had a better view of the Eagles game ( he was wearing an eagles jersey) we were told we would have to go back on the waiting list while the main restaurant area was basically empty. They sat a table of 6 before us in the table we requested and they came in after us! They told me they would put two tables together for us and we stood there which seemed like an ETERNITY and it never happened. We finally left and took our business elsewhere. I am a small business owner and customer service is our number one priority. We were treated so incredibly horrible. We'll never go back"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good but is usually packed. Haven't had a problem with service which is great and on deal days the food is relatively inexpensive"}
{"text":"Service is slow sometimes randomly. Sometimes it takes forever to get a server. The place is reasonably priced on Tuesdays and Thursdays and my favorite flavor is the parmesan garlic and always extra wet wings. But recently they increased the prices of all the items and also took out the half off Tuesdays, so I don't know if it's worth going here that often anymore."}
{"text":"We are a family of wing eaters and we can normally count on BWW to nail our request.  We like the medium and well done.  Crispy and they don't disappoint.  Just a note, he medium is more flavorful whereas we find the hot to be more of a  and Tabasco mix.  Intended to burn baby!"}
{"text":"Bad experience. Ordered simple meals two plates of wings, and french fries. The french fries didn't come out till we were almost done with our meal. We were seated outside on the outside terrace. No one told us you could smoke out there even though there were children and many people eating dinner. Some guy sat down right next to us and lit up a cigar!!! Ahhhh! Why weren't we told this! It was my understanding that in Arizona, if food is served at a restaurant, you can't smoke. We will never go back there again! The table was sticky too."}
{"text":"Eh, I've never really gotten great service at a BWW, but this location was just decent. Each time I've paid a visit, it  wasn't really packed so getting seated is super quick.   What really bums me out about this particular location is the slow service. The actual servers though are really nice and polite, it's just that getting our order had a 45 minute wait. When I go to a restaurant I LOVE it when the servers check up on me, but our servers at this location were not as attentive as other servers in other establishments.   One awesome thing though: THEY HAVE THE BEST BLOODY MARY. So if you're ever getting a craving, go to BWW, you won't be disappointed.  It's still BWW, so their wings are what keeps me coming back. ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"The deal with Buffalo Wild Wings is this: Stay the fuck away from it.  Just don't go.  If you go anywhere else, the service will range from slightly below average to good, but stay the hell away from that place.    Trust me.  The other locations are fine, however.  Now then, service aside, on to the food.  BWW (Or B-Dubs, or B-Dub-Dub, or Bufwizzle For Shizzle, or Bu-...you get the point) has a selection of big sized burgers that thankfully now come with fries.  Previously, paying $6-8 netted you simply a burger sans accoutrements, so I'm glad that they've seen the err of their ways and wisened up.   They have ribs that are adequate, nice and messy, tacos with whatever sauce you want, chicken sandwiches, and a whole mess of appetizers ranging from mini-cheeseburgers and corn dogs to thick slices of potato dubbed \"Buffalo Chips\" that go great with cheese on top.  The gold standard, however, are their sour cream and chive-infused potato wedges.  These things are killer, and I highly recommend you get a basket with your wings.  The wings themselves, whether boneless or traditional, are \"OK\" at best, though the variety of sauces they have are delectable.  Go with the Mango Habanero, Asian Zing or Caribbean Jerk wings for a sweet/hot combo.    All in all, a good sports bar type atmosphere and beer specials go well with their mediocre wings, and so long as a game is on, you won't notice whether the service sucks or not, which it probably will.  The food makes up for it though, damnit.  But don't you dare go to that shithole in Mesa.  I'll kick your ass."}
{"text":"I visted this BWW on Saturday morning around 4am  with a party of 5 .. our server was Sebastian. He was amazing he provided us with excellent customer service always checking up on us. The food was good ! Ive been to multiple BWW in Vegas and in my home town in California and by far he has been the best server and the food was delicious freshly made and hot."}
{"text":"I have been to many Bdubs across the country as it's one of my favorite places to eat. I have never had such terrible service as this one. Waiter barely waited on us. Took over 35 minutes to get our food on a night it was not busy at all, barely half the tables were sat. I didn't get what I asked for, my bf only got half of what he asked for. My drink sat empty for about 15-20 minutes before he asked if I wanted another one. We ordered food to go after sitting there for 1 1/2 hours. All I ate were fries and a beer. No reason we should have been there that long. Not one person ever asked us if we were doing ok. Very upset with this experience as my other experiences here with other servers have been fantastic. Must have been a bad night."}
{"text":"A cold and irritating experience getting to-go from here.  Pay $25 for a meal and get home to discover there was no sauce put in.  Not surprising because the people working there seemed bothered to both be at work and have to talk to people.  Save your money and find a better location or better yet go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Love medium wings. There are none better. I do hate the \"quick wings\" when they assume they will be busy. Double fried and they sit for who knows how long. Ask for the fresh fried and enjoy them the way they should be eaten."}
{"text":"Small establishment for BWW. Circular bar is enormous. Good happy hour prices, food is typical BWW. Layed back spot away from the strip."}
{"text":"Great bartender and attentive service..... but really?! Really?! No champagne on a Sunday?! What about mimosas?"}
{"text":"My default beer and food place when i don't want something more complicated. Big space, usually sit at or near the bar. Wings and o-rings are pretty much all I ever get and they are good in a pinch. Beer selection has improved over the years. You can count on a couple from great lakes, 2-3 from dogfish head, and then a rotating draft from fathead's, stone, buckeye, etc."}
{"text":"Very nice experience. Loved the wings (my husband and I ordered 30 - which was a bit optimistic since we couldn't finish them in spite of the gluttony). 3 different sauces ( you can order a different sauce for every 5 wings). The wings were huge, the round part looked like little drumsticks. Crispy on the outside juice inside. Yummi. Very friendly staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Expensive! But friendly staff, my food was cold when they brought it to me, they replaced the whole order and gave me 10% off."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at this location! I came in Thursday night around 10pm place wasn't that packed, we sat at the bar for a little over 5 minutes and no one approached us. We then moved to a table and our server finally came. She wasn't that helpful but I can't complain about her service until when the check came out check was $30 and we told our server I was paying half and my cousin the other half. When she brings our receipts mines says $15 and hers say $15. Cool we sign it. The next day I check my bank account and I see they charged me $30 instead of $15, I call my cousin she said she also shows they charged her $15. So they over charged me for $15! I know it's only $15 but I had signed for what amount to charge! So I was very disappointed and the lack of service on top of that is making sure I won't be back to this location at least."}
{"text":"Sooo, my rating isn't really regarding the food. I've been twice- waited until after the 2nd time to Yelp to give them a fair chance but really wanted to share my experience to possibly save somebody else from the hassle.... Both times the food was pretty good.  The wings weren't amazing but they certainly weren't terrible either. My biggest beef is with the service. BOTH times we had suuuuuuuper slow servers. Both times they screwed up at least 2 times.  The first guy gave us the wrong order, I'm a good patron, I totally expect stuff happens and I usually give the benefit of the doubt. Well- he AGAIN brought the wrong thing. How does one manage to do that!?  We decided to give them another try since it's the closer BWW to us and we were totally craving wings. Well? It was way worse this time.  Food quality was the same- pretty good.  Service? Sucky.  It was really odd because there seemed to be an over abundance of employees scheduled this particular night and yet the service was super slow.  When the girl finally came to take our orders, I ordered a soft drink and my boyfriend ordered a beer.  So she comes back and does get my drink right, but brings him a completely different beer.  I try to flag her down as she leaves without even asking if we were good and tell her she's given us the wrong beer. \"Oooops! I'll be back!\" No lie- at least 5 mins later she finally shows up with the correct one.  The food arrived and this time there were no hiccups with the wings, so we were just trying to enjoy the meal. So again I had to flag her down for a refill on my beverage and again for the check since we wanted to catch a movie.  The check shows up and I always look to make sure things are ok (especially when I can tell the server is a ditz) and sure enough- she charged us for the incorrect beer AND the one he originally ordered and got eventually.  I flag her down again and tell her about it and she apologizes and says she'll fix it.  At this point, my boyfriend had given her the card to charge after she had fixed the tab. I warned him against it because the girl was dumb as rocks, but let the inevitable happen.  Minutes later she appears and says she's having trouble figuring out how to remove the charge and that she had charged the card before she changed the total. Awesome. So now the manager had to come and fix the whole mess and we were FINALLY on our way.  We both decided that we'd never come back to this particular location and try the Gilbert location off Gilbert."}
{"text":"Planned a fun day with my close family and i planned to go to buffalo wild wings, we waited like normal, the wings are why i came and i wasnt let down. I waited for my meal a little more then expected due to i didn't give my sauce for my burger that came with the meal, no biggie i kept waiting after asking 3 different times to two different people. Finally after everyone at my table was done eating i finally got my sauce. Besides the wait are server seemed like a busy lady she kept bring my boy friend drinks,but not the whole table. Besides this encounter i love this plave."}
{"text":"The sauce is great and there are a ton of TVs. That's really the end of the good things about this place. Every time I go there I'm disappointed with the service. Servers and bartenders don't to care very much about customer service and generally take their time getting around to you.   I've been eating their wings since way back when they were still called BW3, so every few months I get nostalgic and think let me give it another shot. But I don't bother dining in anymore, it's strictly a carry out affair now."}
{"text":"I have to update my review . This place have very poor management. I went to have unch today and I wanted to seat outside so girl put me outside ...she said server is on the way . I was waiting someone to show up to  take an Oder for 25mins or more but no one came so I went at the front and let the lady know and left .it wasn't her fault that server didn't show up on me .I am a very loyal client to Buffalo Wild Wings . I would understand if they were busy but they weren't busy at all . It's just sad how poor management can be . Very disappointed. I gave two star just because I like wings . Managment is zero . I didn't wanted to update my review but again I think it's better to review so it will help with management. Thank you ."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this chain of wing joints! Food, atmosphere and staff at this location is all above expected levels. Will continue to frequent this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Constant regular for the past 2 years and service has been steadily declining. Mike you're a genuine c*cksucker. Big head big ego and little to show for. You're a fucking server. Act like it."}
{"text":"Bw3 is known for its wings but most of their other food is just as good. Mini corn dogs are great. grilled chicken buffalitoes are a good choice if you are not in the mood for wings. Also the pulled pork sliders are always a great choice.   I usually get the wings with the dry rub buffalo seasoning. I would have to say these are the best and Asian zing is a close second.   The management is what makes this store better than the other local bw3's.   I placed an order over the phone for 24 dry rub wings. After I get home I notice 12 dry rub and 12 honey mustard, so I give bw3 a call and the manager apologizes then asks for my address. He personally delivered my 12 dry rub wings. What other place is willing to do that for their customers?"}
{"text":"I tried to place an order for take out and was put on hold for 10 minutes. Then some one picked up the phone and asked who I was holding for. Then when I went to the restaurant they said the wait would be 30 minutes for a take out order."}
{"text":"It's Bdubs - Mentor style.  Consistent for food and service.  Random for a crowd.  If there is a big event the place will be packed, but on a random Friday night it might be you and 3 other people from Peoria that had there flight home cancelled.  Come in and see Rachel, Roxie, James or Kyle at the bar.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of BWW however number of things wrong tonight at this location. 1. Hostess acted like they didn't want to be there nor help seat us. 2. Waitress Maria was ok however she got my order wrong. 3. Food was cold, dry, flavorless. ( i know BWW its packed with flavor i have never hd this issue before.)  The best thing of our visit at BWW is our second server that took over for Maria whom was Robert. He was very nice, had a smile on his face, continued to check on us. Great energy. Robert saved the experience tonight."}
{"text":"Holy trinity of blazing wings, football, and bad customer service. Food is typical, no complaints, but the staff is bit rude. If you want a good placed for wings and football then this is the place to go, customer service needs improvement."}
{"text":"Not a fun first time experience ... Very crowded, load . Service no so good either . Was very hard to understand the menu for the first time . Our server wasn't so attentive ."}
{"text":"Came out here for some lunch. Ordered some boneless mango habanero wings which were delish nice and juicy. Also the buffalo chicken sandwich which was not so crispy as i had hoped but still pretty good. The house margarita blended was nicely done, not too strong but not watered down it was pretty perfect. Overall a delicious experience. We come here often but sometimes its a hit or miss."}
{"text":"The food is good....selection is ok.  The service is good. It is WAY loud ALL of the time.  I understand that it is more of a sprots bar kinda feel but not being able to hear the waitress was a little frustrating/ We will go back I am sure of it."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of BBW for years but today's experience was different. I usually order wings but today I ordered a chicken Ceasar salad. When it came out, the lettuce was soggy, the cheese all melted, and the chicken tasted like it was cooked in the microwave. At least they were able to swap the order for some wings.  NOTE: the women's restroom has NO CHANGING TABLE. I had to change my baby on the ledge of the sinks. And no toilet covers! It's not that they ran out of covers, there is literally no toilet cover holders. Eww."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service out of any restaurant in Las Vegas. Also the wings have made me sick before several times I'm done with BWW because of this location. Recently I stood at the take out counter for 20 minutes made clear eye contact with several employees and just got ignored. I honestly hate this place."}
{"text":"The only time I go to Buffalo Wild Wings is for their happy hour and Tuesday specials. I came to this particular location because my friend lives close by to this one. And we were really craving wings ! Although I only crave American wings like once or twice a year.  Their happy hour starts from 2 pm-7 pm and 10 pm-2 am only on weekdays for appetizers and drinks. I like their mozzarella sticks for 4$. Imported and domestic draft beers go from 3-5$. On Tuesdays , their traditional wings are 60 ¢ each at this location. They charge extra for sauce.  I LOVE their \"Asian zing\" flavor. It's a must whenever I come here. However , I was really disappointed with the \"wild\" flavor. It's the second \"spiciest\" sauce on the menu BUT IT WAS NOT SPICY AT ALL. It was \"mild\" at best. I should've tried their \"reformulated blazin'\" sauce (apparently hottest sauce on the menu) but it's just one up from \"wild\" flavor , so I don't think it would be that spicy. Wingstop is better if you want spicy wings.  If they have their Tuesday/Thursday specials , then this is the place to go , but if it's not Tuesday/Thursday , I much prefer Wingstop for their food."}
{"text":"I have been to buffalo wild wings all over the country and this by far is the worst one I have ever been too!   The only good thing about this place was there beer selection. I ordered a simple appetizer and my cousin ordered 6 wings.  When we got the order at least 30 minutes after we ordered it came out cold.  DO not waste your time coming to this place."}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars but to be honest, we didn't get to sample the food. We didn't even get drinks, because in the 20 minutes that we were waiting here, we were not even given the chance to order anything.  We walked in, 3 adults and an infant. The dining room was largely unoccupied and there were numerous waitstaff on hand. We were escorted hastily to a table and a high chair was dragged to the corner. We put Baby D in and started perusing the menus.   We were not informed of any lunch specials, or asked if we had any questions, or spoken to at all.  After 5 minutes went by and we saw waitstaff aimlessly milling about, I decided to start feeding Baby D some peas.  After 15 minutes went by and she finished her peas and we still had not ordered, we decided to think about either flagging down a server to order or leaving.  After 20 minutes went by and no sign of a server anywhere, we gathered up our things and walked towards the exit.  Wordlessly."}
{"text":"Slow service, waitress practically ignored us and staff didn't seem to care when I complained. Will not be back to this location ever !!"}
{"text":"2nd time here the first time i was so good, this time we come in and the server takes our order and my kids say what they want hubby says what he wants, than i order 6 extra crispy and she says its gonna be 45 min for that to come out since u want yours crispy. wtf, this aint my first time here so why would u even say that... yup got up and left."}
{"text":"This restaurant is alright in my opinion because they always have a large wait time from the stadium near there. When there isn't a large wait time it's either short staffed, empty of customers, or both. This restaurant could be better considering the fact that they give some foods cold. Their seating takes long and as well as their food service. The stadium I understand is a great resource for them but they should be prepared on those type of days. They let a lot of people do carry outs of large orders, not like 3 mediums  dishes of wings but like 8 larges. This really slows down the food service inside the restaurant. Their waiters are respectful and some are amazing but for the food to come out of the kitchen warm is awful. Yes they have a variety of delicious sauces but those sauces aren't gonna make up for the long wait from both seating and food delivery they give out cold food. A two is just fine for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried to be like my sister and order Medium wings!! Bad idea!! I can't even eat hot Cheetos but at least I tried. Had I gotten appropriate wings for myself, I'm sure I would have enjoyed them. After getting coast the heat, the wings were cooked well.  It included carrots and celery which help!!!  The manager and our waitress Micah was extremely nice.  They provided great customer service.  I like the bar atmosphere... Nice place to hang with friends and/or watch the games.  It makes me want to get into sports!  Tuesday is wing day!!!"}
{"text":"Everything as far as the basics food, service are as expected at a chain. The acoustics are what brings this place down.  Instead of blasting all the games into a garbled mess they should put receivers on each table and number the screens so you can  tune in to what game you want. Crowd can be a little douchey too.  Can't do much about that.  Kind of the opposite of a local pub."}
{"text":"Okay let me start off with...it was a Thursday night, NCAA tourney night and 60 cent wing night at Buffalo Wild Wings...so I expected it to be a little crazy.  We had a group of twenty from our church having a going away gathering for one of our friends.  That being said.  It was crowded, and LOUD in the bar area, but we opted for first available seating so I guess I can't be too picky.  But for me, the whole bar area is sensory overload for this ol' gal.  I am trying to watch what I'm eating so I had perused the menu before going and had already decided what I would get.  Grilled Chicken Salad with honey mustard dressing.  It was still very high in sodium and cholesterol, but one of the better choices (you can email and request a pdf file of their nutrition information, but it's not on their website...WHY?) anyhoo..that was my pick.  What I didn't know is that the grilled chicken would be tossed in the slightly tangy honey mustard AND served with a cup for pouring over your salad.  They are not my doctor, but dang...how can you manage to pack 640 calories, 38 grams of fat, 790 mg of sodium and 155 mg of cholesterol into a SALAD withOUT dressing...geez!   Our waitress was really great and got eveyone's order correctly...the biggest issue I had was that our food came out all at different times...which is annoying! I did enjoy my salad but the dressing was not really that good so I doubt I'd get it again.  My husband got two different wings and was happy with them.    I wasn't UN happy with our visit, but it's definitely not my scene - and I highly doubt that I am  their target market...although if the Tarheels were in the tourney still...I'd have been hollering with everyone else!  But that's not Buffalo Wild Wings fault...my meal was less than $9 and I was more than full when I left, so I'll give this visit three stars and leave it at that!"}
{"text":"This place is always great! The servers are so friendly and remember us whenever we come back in. They're wonderful and patient with our 2 year old daughter who tends to throw food and scream when she's angry. The Honey BBQ and Asian Zing boneless are so good! FRIED PICKLES! Amazing.  We go every Sunday during football season!!"}
{"text":"Usually is a 4 star place for us.  My daughter ordered a salad for dinner and turns out they didn't have salad mix so no salad for the girl tonight. Good thing she likes chicken fingers too. Asian Zing is always good. I'm sure it'll be back to 4 stars next time.  Editing....just noticed no silverware and ordered spun tenders.  Didn't happen. Slacking a little tonight BWW."}
{"text":"I live between the locations on Las Vegas Boulevard and Durango. This location is definitely my preferred choice.  Setting: It's a sorts type of wing bar. I was seated promptly after arriving to a Tuesday bball game night with $0.60 wing special. Place was packed.  As always, I order myself Garlic Parmesan and Honey BBQ and boyfriend orders the same along with Thai Curry. A basket of onion rings for appetizer. Not anything special, just hungry for any protein that will curb hunger.  What was supposed to be a routine 10-15 minute wait became a 45min wait. The manager did rounds to each table about 20 minutes in and conversed with customers, greatly apologizing. He said one of the fryers was down and kitchen was insanely backed up. He explained that was even no excuse for the wait and that they'll take care of our wings. (I understand that it's not human error...they're doing the best they can!) Staff was sincere and working hard. Server consistently checked in on us and refilleddrinks.  Overall: Food was ok. Onion rings were battered. Not breaded. Not really worth that long of a wait, but what got this place four stars was service.  Service was attentive despite their backup and when the manager said they'll take care of our wings to apologize for the wait, he really meant it! All the wings that night were free of charge.  One of few places where I know manager routinely does rounds with the customers' table. I don't even think other restaurants would try be so accommodating while you wait. Best bdubs in the valley for service"}
{"text":"I just finished eating not even 10 minutes ago and to be honest I am very disappointed. While the service and food proved to be good our booth was infested with bugs. As soon as we sat down we spotted the first insect, killed it, and let it go hoping that would be the end of it. At the end of our meal we saw at least 10 crawling around the top of the table (see photo). When I was trying to get video evidence the manager came to let us know their pest control comes only once a month. There could have easily been more hiding in the seats, on the carpet, or under the table. The dark lighting made it difficult to see more. These bugs ruined my entire dining experience. After the meal, I just felt itchy and dirty. It makes me question the integrity of the rest of the restraunt. I couldn't drink the water without wondering if that was even clean. The manager did give us $10 off our bill but I don't feel that was appropriate compensation. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I come here at night mostly and ever bartender is quick, friendly, and gets their shit done! Like i said, only at night after work, for beers and snacks... (after 12am).  Awesome food. Love the salt and vinegar seasoning. I put it on everything!!!"}
{"text":"So flipping good. Just moved here from CA and I lived across the street from a BWW there. This place blows that out of the water. Not sure about the other reviews, I throughly enjoyed this location."}
{"text":"Wish I can put no stars! I've been to this location plenty of times after 11pm and every time service is terrible. Food takes forever to come out and there's only about 3 people at the bar. I ordered my food right away and this couple comes in 10 mins after to order food to go. Of course they ended up getting their food before me. Mind I only ordered snack size wings and fries, my sister ordered a quesadilla. It took an hour for it to come out. We had to ask for our food and they bring it out right away. I work in a food industry and this is just terrible service."}
{"text":"We came to BWW to watch the Dbacks vs Nationals  and we had a great time! Our waitress Monique was so attentive and very nice, the food was delicious like always. We asked for our wedges extra crispy and they did just that. I tried the Buffalo wrap, highly recommended! We were leaving and we had forgotten our left overs but before we knew it Monique ran after us to bring us the food! A++, we usually go to the BWW in Tempe but we will definitely start coming back to this one!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch games, unless you're a smoker. The no E-Cigarette rule is a bit annoying. I understand it's a family establishment, but the vape doesn't hurt anyone. The food is good. Service is exceptional! I have been going there since Brian G the Saints fan, and Chung worked the bar. We miss Brian, glad Chung is still there!  I would definitely recommend this establishment to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"Service was awful and our server  was grumpy ,unfriendly and never came back to our table except to deliver the check  and they kept a line out the door with multiple tables empty.    This was far from a normal Buffalo Wild Wings experience   But I guess that what happens when you have 8 staff members and the manager standing at the hostess stand instead of taking care of customers"}
{"text":"This place is so dirty, the bathrooms were disgusting....the service wasn't that great will never come here again"}
{"text":"Went in here last night for dinner. We should've known it was going to be bad as soon as we walked in. We were quickly told there was a 15 minute wait, why? Who knows because there was so many empty tables. Idk what was wrong with our waiter but he seemed a little lost. We told him what we wanted and when he brought out our food, it was incorrect. So he resolved that issue and put in our correct order. So we waited and waited. We almost never got refills. We had to ask another server for our refills because who knows where our waiter was at. Service really sucks at this location and I'm definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"I stopped in at 12:30 to grab some lunch and was told I needed a reservation because it was Super Bowl Sunday and that they were booked up. Excuse me? Its 12:30. Super Bowl doesn't start for another 2.5 hours. I will be contacting their corporate manager for refusing me service."}
{"text":"Updated Review:  Service has much improved here and the food consistency is spot on.  Staff is very attentive and pleasant.  Love the mozzarella sticks to warm up before a giant load of wings. Lov'n the Thai Curry sauce on the wings. I like the Caesar salad and the Mediterranean salad."}
{"text":"Great wings, great sauce and love the chicken Caesar salad. Service is much better than Superstition Springs Blvd yet I can't get a water refill!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever.   My boyfriend decided that going here was the most appropriate to watch the NBA playoffs. I asked to sit at a booth, and the waiter told me to wait because she had a lot to do. Okay, understandable.   She comes by 10 minutes later to tell me that the tables were reserved for people waiting. But according to the 4 booths that opened the next 15 minutes, they were reserved for other 2 people parties; who obviously had no interest of staying longer than their meal to enjoy the game. My waiter nor the manager, who we requested a booth from, had checked up on us throughout meal.. And had no concern our request, which made us unhappy. To me, I believe good customer service doesn't mean fulfilling all requests but instead to fully explain and give reasonable explanations to the result. Instead, they found it appropriate to check up next to us, then turn out only giving off a glare.  Going to bdubs all the time at other locations, I have always received the same service. It was disappointing that this location did not own up to those expectations."}
{"text":"Our waitress Cindy was one of the slowest I have ever seen. Restaurant was dead maybe 4 tables and she only had 3 of them. This was the first time here in Vegas and it will be the last time if there service is this crappy.  Beware if you have a lot of time on your hands.  I would hate to see it if they were busy."}
{"text":"Great place for group outings or just grabbing a round at the bar. Can't beat all the sports options!"}
{"text":"We got here at 7 received food at 740 order was wrong so now we have to wait again! We're hungry! Some of the food we did receive  was cold like it's been sitting there! We will not be returning ... and the waitress was rude only asked if we needed something once. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Paulette took my order over the phone for our office lunch. Good phone voice, read my order back correctly, pleasant phone convo. I get there and my grilled chicken sandwiches turned into buffalo ranch chicken sandwiches. Yeah I didn't order that. She brings her manager over, nice guy, says they can fix it. As I am waiting, I can see and hear her talking to her coworkers about the situation. You messed up, not a big deal. You talk crap after? Now I'm upset. Another girl offered me water while I wait, but I feel this needs to be posted.  Fix the guests order...talk crap after I leave. Two stars for the nice manager and hostess."}
{"text":"Service suck it took forever to take our order it wasn't bussy it took 20 min. For apetizers where cold and another 20 for our food to be serve and ask for a manager never show up never coming back to this location !!"}
{"text":"I came here with my brother to grab some wings to go.  It was half-time of the 49ers-Saints playoff game and the place was busting at the seams.  We got our order in and had to wait awhile, so I'd recommend calling ahead if there is some big game going on.  Love the newly added soft pretzels to the menu.  It goes well with the wings and should put you into a good food coma, which was fine because the Pats-Broncos game pretty much had me down for the count anyway.  Add online ordering and this place will be the go to place when I'm visiting my brother again."}
{"text":"four stars cos the beer is pricey BUT FIVE STARS COS THE BEER IS SO DELICOUS!"}
{"text":"Crappy wings, boneless wings are even worse. If you are looking to visit a restaurant with tasteless food, drunk 19 year olds and waste your money you've come to the right place"}
{"text":"This was my boyfriend on his birthday, disappointed it wasn't \"24/7\". He really wanted BWW wings as his first meal to celebrate his 30th, after 10 minutes of ringing the doorbell for guests \"after 11 pm\", no one came so I called and no one answered. We went to Hooters instead. At least when they say they're 24/7, they are. Switching to Hooters."}
{"text":"Terrible location I ordered 30 min in advance not only was the order wrong and had to wait an extra 20 minutes for my correct order but the person that worked there had the worst attitude absolutely disappointed with bww"}
{"text":"Service around 7 on a slow Saturday night.   Got wings boneless with mild and buffalo chips. Wings were great I got cheese on chips and that was not as good.  Service was not great. Server was very pleasant but had to ask for serve ware and never got beverage refills.   Choose carry out if you can."}
{"text":"BWW is definitely my go-to spot to go have a beer and watch the game especially now that NFL FOOTBALL has finally started!!! This place is great for big groups, usually always loud environment, so you can have a good time with friends or family and not worry about being too obnoxious if your group gets too loud.   They have your typical \"wing place\" menu, but I definitely enjoy their wing options here over any other big name wing places out west (WING HOUSE is my other FAV but it's only located east and down south). Their wings have great flavored options that are super tasty and the meat on the wings aren't skimpy, always full meat wings.   Place is clean and spacious, and service has always been good. Besides the wings, they also have really good appetizers and I've had their burgers more than once, and the Black and Bleu burger is really good if you're a bleu cheese fan.   Fav hot flavor is def the Mango Habenero, some people say it's too hot but I say if you like \"asian style spicy\" go for it!! I'm never disappointed when eating here.   I like how they have lots of wet napkins at the table already so you never have to ask the server for it.   Like I said, this is my go to place especially with FOOTBALL season and the super big screens just making watching more fun cheering for your teams with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Called in my order this evening for 2-ten piece wings, gave them specific cooking instructions, got home to find half of my order wrong! Tried calling to speak to a manager and was put on hold for over 3 min. Called back and spoke to a woman who kept giving excuses as to why the manager couldn't come to the phone.  I was on hold for over 20 minutes. I understand that they are busy but I am also a paying customer who's order was wrong!! Poor customer service"}
{"text":"Food was good, restaurant was mostly clean, and I hope so considering the wait staff was barely paying attention to customers. Started off positive until about 15 minutes after our food arrived.  We started looking for the waitress and after 10 minutes of sitting up in our seats like meerkats trying to catch ANY waitresses eye to find out where ours was, I had to get up from the table, go find the hostess, ask about our server, and then wait there for a different server to come talk to me at the front.  We wanted to order some more wings for our table and 2 orders of celery. So the other waitress put our order into the kitchen.  Another 10 minutes later our server shows up (didn't see her anywhere for 25 minutes), and I ask where the 2 orders of celery were and she was surprised and said \"they didn't bring it out yet?\".  And then went and got us 1 (not 2) orders.  Why would it be the kitchens job to bring us our order and not hers?  By the time the wings did get to us we just wrapped them up to go.   I understand when a table isn't yours and you don't want to take care of them, but at least notice when 4 people at a table are looking around with their hands in the air trying to get your attention.  All you have to do is acknowledge it and go get whoever is working that table.  Ignoring it (especially when there's only 3 full tables in your dining room) is lazy, poor service, and training on EVERYONES part."}
{"text":"you can always have a deliciously good time here at bw3's! they have a variety of flavors for the wings! from Sweet to FREAKING hot! Also the wedges here are very good! Its a must for me when I go eat! Also, its a good place to go eat with friends and family, they have a clean and spacious eating area and the bar is great. I love how they have so many TV's around so you can watch many different types of sports. plus, they have Tuesday and Wednesday wing night ! wings are cheap and tasty! oh, and service is good too."}
{"text":"If I could give this place NO stars I would. I came in today for lunch with some of my coworkers. I got a fast break lunch which I redeemed on by Blazin account. When we got the checks my server, Danielle mentioned that she had put my blazin in, but nothing had theme taken off. I showed her and the manager that I did redeem it and it may have been a restaurant issue. The manager seemed to not care at all and still made me pay for my meal. My server was very apologetic which was nice but the management SUCKS!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a noisy sports bar with cold beers and great wings, then you've found it.  If this is what you love, then you will give this place five stars.  BUT, if you make the mistake of ordering anything other than wings, you will be sorely disappointed, as I discovered on my recent trip to the Westgate location.   I've never been let down in my other experiences at BWWs - probably because I went to cool college campus locations on wing special nights - but I was less than impressed this time.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and a side salad.  After a lengthy wait, considering it wasn't that busy, a young food-runner (not our waitress), brought a burger to our table.  I pointed out that my chicken sandwich appeared to be a burger, to which she replied, \"Oh, no, it's a chicken sandwich.  It just looks that way when it's grilled.\"  Our waitress caught the delivery error - and my experience was not negatively affected by it - but I just thought it was funny that this teenage girl was arguing with me.  My grilled chicken sandwich was of the same quality as a fast-food restaurant.  It was kind of rubbery, and it was served on a dry white bun.  The side salad consisted of wilty iceberg lettuce with brown edges. At $10, I expected more.  Of course, I blame myself for not ordering the wings at a place where this is the specialty, but I was still underwhelmed by the speed of the service, atmosphere, and price."}
{"text":"I don't know what was going on with our waitress tonight but wow was service slow and lack on attentiveness.  Normally this restaurant is top notch BUT, one seeing a young man look bother to give a refill of coke, saw the young roll his eyes when he walked away with her empty glass.  My wife even asked me if I saw that.  Piss poor attitude. Now back to our waitress. First tonight was not a busy night, open tables everywhere.  9:30pm No need to mention names but we sat at a high top table against the wall since its was open seating there.  It took the waitress 15 minutes to bring us a menu and take our drink orders.  The waited other 15 minutes for our drinks so I asked for manager, once he arrived I mentioned I would like know if our drinks were ordered.  He walked half way to the bar then turned around and walked to the back.  Never saw him again.  Finally got our drinks after 20 minutes then our waitress took our order then everything seemed ok.  Well I know from being a waiter you need to check up on your tables for refills and etc because you are selling yourself for s higher tip and etc.  well our waitress stopped once to see if all things were good and never again.  Saw here talk with all tables, ok so maybe because we were a married couple but still.  Earn your tip.  Now my wife and I were down and this slow ass waitress was talk with the table behind us for about 20 minutes tops and she saw we were clearly done for the night.  I just wanted my check.  Finally received the check,  well I would never stiff a waiter/waitress regardless of service.  But remember young lady you need to earn your tip with anyone, regardless of the bill size.    I do want management to read this because your staff tonight on April 8th, 2015 lacks all customer service.  Understand you hire cheap labor with young adults but train your people. Regardless your in a busy area like westgate but seeing both managers hanging out in the center on the restaurant observing and then outside when we left just watching your staff.  Why don't you train your staff to interact more or even sell on anything.  That's how you become more profitable.  I won't say I won't go again here but all I can say is this is the worse experience I have had here.    TRAIN YOUR STAFF AND GET RID OF THE PISS POOR ATTITUDE'S FROM THE STAFF.  if they don't like their job tell them McDonald's is hiring."}
{"text":"Horrible. Yes, it's a sports bar, but really let's at least try to be better.   Host was pathetic excuse as he ensured his friends were seated before other customers who waited for quite some time to be seated.  Asked for a booth, host informed our group table would be ready shortly after its cleared. His buddies show up and taken to the booth while ignoring others customer who arrived well prior.  Food - for the price of $$$ it tastes less than $ worth.   Waitress - never once asked how the food was or if anyone would like a refill or other type of beverage.  First word pretty much describes our experience at this dive. Draw your own conclusion when you go, better yet make your own and save the money to upgrade your TV to a 60\"."}
{"text":"The TV's are nice, the beer is cold, and the food is OK. I originally wrote a \"if you have been to one, you've been to them all\" review because they really are all very similar - that's what franchises do... but the management reached out and wanted to make things right! So I have updated the review and now I'll eat my words, and who knows? Maybe their wings???"}
{"text":"I watch a lot of football at sports bars because my team is not local. Most places have schedules and a specific set up of what teams will be showing on particular TVs. This place has no organization whatsoever. I'm surprised I go to Zipps one of their major local competitors and they can tell you exactly what TVs will have what games. This place can't tell their blank from a hole in the ground.  They bill it on TV commercials as the place to be for sports. I disagree strongly.  Food is great service is decent but don't come here for sports"}
{"text":"Waiter had a bad attitude  from the time we were seated and told what we could not order because it was considered a busy time. I jokingly said there seemed to be more staff then customer's and was told they take a lot of online orders for pick up. Food was mediocre at best and took awhile . I was going to pay a portion of the bill using a BW3 gift card and was told by the waiter he would deduct 20% gratuity automatically  ( restaurant policy) I said I prefer to give a cash tip instead and want to use the gift card towards the bill. He then said he hates people like me who don't get it. I couldn't believe he said that and then chose to pay our bill with cash. We won't be back and that gift card went in the garbage."}
{"text":"My Wife insisted we try this place because she's really into hot wings. Gotta' tell you.... very, very mediocre. Extremely average. It was a nice atmosphere- It was the last day of the regular hockey season with some important (playoff implication) games going on. Service was really good too... But, Food was really lacking and it was barely OK. To top that, I can't stand when my food is served in a plastic basket! If I'm paying Nine Bucks for a hamburger, at least give me a frickin' PLATE!!!!! Way overpriced  as well."}
{"text":"I have to say I was really craving wings, walked in sat at the bar was served a beer right away and told asked the waitress food food menu now I have waiting 45 mins while others around me have got there food order in while I am ignored The bartender Emmy has to be the worst at her job. I will never set foot in the place again."}
{"text":"What can I say about Buffalo Wild Wings that hasn't already been said? The good thing about a chain restaurant is the consistency of their sauces and food. I've never had to wait for a table at this location, even on wing nights. My service has always been exceptional. My only real complaint is that they do not validate parking here, and there really isn't anywhere close to park unless you luck out at a street spot which are few and far between.   Sauce wise, my personal favorites are Caribbean jerk, Asian zing, mango habanero (sweet heat x 100), and garlic Parmesan. Getting these almost anything, weather wings or a wrap, are a sure way to have good tasting food. As far as sides go, 10/10 would get the potato wedges over anything. These things are like crack when dipped in ranch."}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings is a great addition to the Cedar Fairmount neighborhood. Their friendly, comfortable atmosphere welcomes everyone. All the servers are all very pleasant and helpful. They serve the best fish tacos I ever ate, and have a terrific selection of beers.  I was impressed with their food allergen spreadsheet which details potential allergens in every single item on the menu.  You can watch any sport you want on the many large screens. I always have a great time here."}
{"text":"The birthday boy cried... And he's 29!! What a mess!! Their hiring process must include a Plinko Board.   Bottom Line First: Buffalo Wild Wings has boring food that apparently takes 12 minutes per wing to prepare, a crap beer selection, which is way over prices,  and customer service training comparable to the Nevada Highway Patrol.   If you like wings, don't eat here. If you like your friends and family, don't bring them here.  My next Yelp! List will be PLACES THAT ARE BETTER THAN BUFFALO WILD WINGS.  I have been to this Buffalo Wild Wings about 20 times in the last few years. My friends in the area love it, so we go frequently. Every time we visit this location, everything goes wrong.   I came here for a friend's birthday party and I kept my mouth shut while in the restaurant as to not create a scene.   Our table waited 50 minutes for the wrong food to come out twice. I ordered to go, as I had to leave the party for work. I even paid when I ordered. Our server, shorted my  change and still stressed that gratuity was not included in my total. I didn't make a big deal over it. Every time she came over, she said that mine should be right out. I wanted to cancel it, but again, did not want to make a scene.  I pointed out a bag that had been sitting by the register for 20 minutes. It turns out that this WAS my order. She had it remade, which made me really uncomfortable.   She tried to make a joke out of it, not understanding how difficult it is for me to not be mean sometimes. She did not offer to refund the food cost or offer anything additional either, she just said \"well you have somewhere to be, so get out of here.\"  The food, which I had to eat on my rushed drive was spilled all over the bag and was not hot. The napkins in the bag were soaked from the spilled sauce. It was the typical, half-assed Buffalo Wild Wing garbage food with no veggie sides.  (I will spell check this later)"}
{"text":"We went in one night and place wasn't even half full, yet they were keeping people waiting in the lobby. We asked why, as there were tons of available tables. The hostess said they were waiting on a party of 11 to show. So, what does that have to do with us? Why keep everyone waiting because of another group of people? We felt that was ride and unnecessary. My husband mentioned so and we were about to leave when they seated us.   After that, service was great by our waitress.  Still, their food seems to have declined recently."}
{"text":"Took a long time to get our drinks..manager did not accommodate our request o. Our game..  And the pace not packed.  And when she did..  She put it on a small TV..  Too dark and just didn't get a good vibe of place.  Failed to live up to hype that TV promotes."}
{"text":"When reviewing a national chain, the review should primarily be focused on activities that are highly variable such as:  - ambiance (different stores have different layouts) - service (this is highly variable) - Cleanliness (stores vary) - etc.  Large chains like BWW are great at being consistent in their food recipes and menu selection, a mango habanero wing in Florida will virtually taste the same as a mango habanero wing in Arizona. This is standard for all large companies, Mcdonalds wants everyone to have the same experience when ordering a Bigmac, regardless of where they get it from, this is the same with BWW because of this my review will primarily be focused on services and ambiance of the restaurant.    *Ambiance - The restaurant is extremely clean as it should be for being a little more than a year old. Big screen tv's are plastered on every square inch of the walls. The space is big and wide, being cramped will be the least of your worries.   *Service - Due to it being Wing Tuesday the place was swamped and unfortunately BWW was severely understaffed. Based on past experience at other BWW, I waited far too long for my server to come by to take my order. The food also took much longer than usual for a Tuesday, this tempe branch needs to staff appropriately, when in doubt overstaff.   *Cleanliness - A+ here, no rants =D   *Consistency  - They were out of carrots. I repeat no carrots. I ordered the veggie boat that comes with celery and carrots, but again no carrots. They also ran out of cole slaw cups. The supply chain at this restaurant is in dire need of a makeover, they stocked out of carrots and cole slaw cups for goodness sake!   Conclusion.  Food is consistent with other BWW's I have been to. What sets this branch apart from the rest is its lack of preparation. - Understaffed for an easily foreseen busy Tuesday. - Stockouts of carrots! I love my carrots with my habanero wings! - Stockouts of Coleslaw cups. I hope they fix their supply chain!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pick up of small boneless wings and potato wedges tonight.   We found chicken pieces and left over stuffed  mushroom in the potato wedges pack. My wife is a vegan and this is totally unacceptable.. Never again here.. We drove all the way from Scottsdale as this is the only branch open until 2."}
{"text":"They have good deals goin on. Perfect for when you are craving bar food. Their artichoke and cheese dip was good! I tried the Asian wings and they had a nice tangy taste to it. Not as spicy as I expected it to be."}
{"text":"I would give this location ZERO stars if I could.  My family ate here for my brothers graduation and our first issue started when we arrived and were told by the hostess our reservation was given to another table because the tables are \"first come first serve\". Let me clarify that it WAS NOT BUSY it was a Saturday night too. They had no reason to give away our table because our party was not complete. The (female) manager offered to sit us at a table on the patio and since we had kids we agreed. We sit and the rest of our group arrives and our server Vanessa takes our drinks. It took 40 minutes to get a daiquiri, seriously? I am not trying to bash the server because she was very nice but none of this should've happened, I have been a server and worked at places far busier than this place which is why I was outraged. Our food took 50 minutes to arrive, let me just add that it arrived about five minutes AFTER we asked the server how much longer our food would be, we receive our food and it was all COLD, not just cold, it looked like literal display food. All the cheese fries had cold hard cheese that stuck to the paper. Our wings? COLD. Our fries? COLD AND HARD. This is not an exaggeration. We have pictures of it all. I would never have food that looked like that even exit the kitchen. When the manager arrived to speak to us she has the audacity to tell us that we will be charged for everything we consumed. Excuse me, but I was not going to pay for cold ass food. My children could've gotten sick. This food had been sitting there for at least half an hour. I will also add, the manager never returned. She did nothing to fix the problem, and she went to hide after. The server gave us the check and we left. The entire time we were here the location was dead slow. There was no reason for the rotten customer service. The way the PATHETIC EXCUSE for a manager handled this situation is seriously absurd. I will be contacting the health district about this because clearly, the manager needs to retake her health card exam again. I am never eating here again. This place is revolting to say the least."}
{"text":"Was the very first customer in the door for the grand opening, received free wings for a year. I tried Buffalo Wild Wings for the first time in May in Hollywood & fell in love with it with the first bite. I came home & realized one was being developed for Calgary. LOVE the food. Great sauces, my absolute favourite is the Honey BBQ sauce .. Had it on my bacon cheeseburger .. Can't go wrong with that sauce. Amazing place to watch all sports, tons of screens, comfy booths, great staff who were very friendly. Will be going back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great service. Didn't like the wings. The only option for naked wings is deep fried. They were tasteless. Might want to add dusted to the menu. Prices are good. The deep fries mushrooms were tasty. All food served on onetime use throw away containers. Not very friendly to the environment. Staff was friendly. Manager made a point of chatting with us. Very busy."}
{"text":"Love eating at the bar and Brandon is the most attentive bartender I've had in awhile. Took some time for the staff to get that we are regulars but thats squared away. Food is fast and good when not at peak time of the day. You will wait a bit during events, but that's anywhere. I recommend hitting the bar and playing some trivia games with the staff. They have some crazy answers, and keep it fun."}
{"text":"Had high hopes tried the wings weren't very great also went on boneless wing night and those were subpar the breading was too thick and the sauces did not taste good tried over 6 flavors"}
{"text":"I come here all the time and I love it. I advise you come right when they open if you want your order to be perfect. At night the service is really slow because they get really busy and you are constantly looking for your waitress/ waiter for little things like silverware and straws but other than that the service is good. It also really depends on who your server is cause last time I went my server was at a table sitting down and talking to the guest for 15 minutes before we even got our drinks. We usually get the same server every time we go and he is great and always makes sure we are happy and good to."}
{"text":"I was told not to review chain restaurants, but this one needs better ratings.   This place is bomb.  0.45 cent Tuesdays are probably the best.  The pitchers of beers are cheap ($8-14 for domestics).  The wings are the best.  So far I've only had a few on the less spicy scale, but for sure will revisit to kick it up a notch.   One complaint is that sometimes they charge you for ranch and celery, and sometimes they don't charge.  The wings are consistently good though!"}
{"text":"Service was TERRIBLE. My group of six sat at one of the tables in the bar area. The bar area was only half full, and there were two waitresses on. We waited ten minutes to have our drink order taken, five for our drinks (all beer, nothing fancy) to get dropped off, then another five for our food order to be taken.  Okay, whatever, life goes on. I'm patient, I can live with that. The killer comes with the fact that the waitress dropped off our food order, said \"enjoy\" and walked away. I looked down at my place of nice, hot NOTHING! She didn't give me my food! At this point the combination of beer and smelling everyone else's wings is driving me nuts. But it takes me another five minutes to flag down the waitress, who checked and never put in my order. So while everyone else was enjoying, I was not, and then ate when everyone else was done.  The only thing that saved this location from the dreaded one star was that my wings were coated in sauce, which was good because the amount of sauce used varies wildly by location and cook."}
{"text":"Pros: Decent price, good fries, seasonOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!ings and sauces, so many TVs.  Cons: Noisy NO WAYAAYYY!, loud, uninspired wait service, and the place generally inhibited jovial storytelling GOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAL and joking time."}
{"text":"Some of their staffs are really rude. I had the experience with the purple hair server and also the American fatty host that never smile. If you are an asian or look teenager, they may treat you like an idiot."}
{"text":"I love their chicken traditional wings.food was good, ambience was good for us as we went to spend some time together.only negative point was we had to wait too long to order our next drink.but all together good place for weekend time pass"}
{"text":"Great wing sauces, good beer specials, lots of inventive menu items, and just about every traditional bar food you can imagine.  Always clean and lots of TVs to watch/games to play.  Service is timely and food is always well prepared."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews for chains, but I am for this one because I don't agree with the extremely low reviews. I was here on New Years Eve and they had so many catering orders plus a full house that orders were running 45 min behind. Our server told us immediately but we still stayed. He kept our drinks filled up the whole time we waited even though we just had waters. I love the boneless wings here. I love BWW and this location is a great one. Its a very new location too :)"}
{"text":"I'm just... so over this place. The actual food isn't bad. In fact, their black bean burger is pretty good! As a vegetarian, I REALLY appreciate that. But there are a few things that really annoy me. My husband and I ordered mozzarella sticks for an appetizer. Our waiter brought them. I asked for a side of ranch, he said that would be $.45. REALLY?! I just kind of starred at him, because I assumed he was kidding. Yeah, he wasn't. I almost didn't get it just on principle alone, but I really wanted the ranch. So I did. It wasn't even the good ranch. :( It was the crappy kind. I used less than 1/4 of it. Worst. 45. Cents. I've. Ever. Spent. EVER. Then, and this might just seem like I'm being picky, and maybe I am, but I was annoyed after the ranch incident, but they didn't have pickles for my burger. Well, they had those long quarter sliced ones, but they can't go on your burger. Unless you spend 5 minutes cutting them up. Which, I did. Ugh. I feel like there was one other thing that really annoyed me, but I can't remember.   Anyway, bottom line is the food is fine, but everything else annoys me. My husband LOVES this chicken flat bread thing, though. And he doesn't like ranch dressing OR pickles, so of course he loves this place."}
{"text":"This review is long over-due for me. I've been to this BWW so many times since I moved here that I've lost count. I usually try to go during Happy hour/Tuesdays to fully enjoy myself.   Starting off with appetizers they have a good variety to choose from (Mozzarella sticks/Chips & Salsa/Onion Rings etc) for only $3 during happy hour as well as $3-5 for Imported & Domestic draft beers. Traditional Wings on Tuesdays they charge 60¢ Per wing.   Bar - (Can't have wings without a cold one) For beer selections, they have a great variety of beers to choose from. From Stella Artois to Angry Orchard and some good ol' Samuel Adams.   Any Variation of BBQ (Sweet/Hot/Honey/Chipotle/Korean BBQ) - I really find the BBQ flavors here to be really bland and lackluster, they really don't impress compared to other places such as wingstop where the BBQ is savory and just overall delicious, definitely won't be ordering them any time soon  Hot Wings (Mild/Medium/Hot/Buffalo) - As far as wings go, these are the ones you HAVE to order, From my experiences in Vegas every sauce that i've tried so far is either too salty, hot, bland, sweet, or vinegary. The sauce should be tangy with a nice vinegar hit, taste rich of butter, and of course have heat BWW hits this perfectly and I couldn't be more pleased.  The main problem that I've had with Buffalo wild wings is just inconsistency in every aspect. The service is either out of this world or straight up awful. As for the wings they could have the perfect amount of sauce and great taste, drowned in sauce and ruin your meal, or they could have no sauce at all and leave you disappointed.   But as long as they keep Happy hour and Tuesday specials, i will be coming back as much as I can!"}
{"text":"Bathrooms are terribly dirty and smelly. Just makes me wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen??? Yuck - thank god I didn't order any food but I worry about those that did."}
{"text":"This is basically where I like to go for good chicken Wings. The varieties they have are super! Good games and good wings bring a crowd!! It's okay with me wait for great Wings and Popcorn Shrimp. Ready for some Asian Zing and Mango Habener wings, Traditional!!!  If ask for em' wet, they come extra saucy ;)"}
{"text":"I always sit at the bar here and Brandon has been our bartender and he has done a phenomenal job. Numerous beer selections on tap including Kona Blue Wave and Goose island. As well as several San Tan beers and four peaks. My only issue with the place is the food is just always ehh.  Nothing great, however Brandon's customer service and great beera make this place a 4. My friends and I enjoyed talking about the Mcgregor loss to Diaz with him."}
{"text":"I know, I know! If you go to a wing place you should order wings.  Well, I was trying to be healthy so I ordered their bbq chicken salad!  What a JOKE!  They should be embarrassed with the quality of salad they served.  Brown slimy lettuce and what wasn't slimy was wilted.  There were six pieces of chicken about the size of a dime and not much thicker!  Seriously!  I'm glad they only gave me about a cup of lettuce, because much more and I would have puked!  The preservatives on the lettuce was strong, so you know it had to be older than dirt to have it brown and wilted. All of this enjoyment for $8.49.  Came withe a cup of soup.  Glad it did or I would have died of hunger before I got to dinner. What a rip off! If I were you I would skip this place and go to Native New Yorker.  I personally am never returning to any BWW anywhere!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is hands down my favorite restaurant ! The wings are always amazing. I've been to bdubs probably over 20 times. The online ordering is pretty great not too sure if they had that in NYC. Only had one problem where my wings were dead. Seems like the wings were sitting there and my order came in and I got the unlucky batch. Other than that pretty good !"}
{"text":"This place sucks! One night after work I decided to get an order to go. I live very close and when I got home the food was cold! We were upset and called to let them know, the guy working said he would relay the message to a manager and have them call us for a comp'd meal. He said they would call me the next day, days went by with no call. So we decided one late night to go in (which was a mistake). We thought maybe if we explained what happened we would get a comp that we were promised. We waited in the front nobody told us to seat ourselves we literally waited like 5/10 min and finally sat at the bar where we waited another ten min and no one ever came out. So I decided to call the next day and speak to a manager. I explained both of the situations to him. He was very intrusive asking who was working what day etc etc which ok I guess I understand he has to get more info but he wasn't even apologetic at all. He was rude! And he did not want to give us a comp. He could've atleast given us a 30% off something if he couldn't a comp. Such a shame that they have horrible customer service when it's so close to my house."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out online with a pickup time of 4:20.  The order was for two adults and two kids. We arrived just before 4:20, when we were told that they were getting our order ready. The seating area was nearly empty at this time. After we had to ask about the order several times, it was finally ready at 4:47, nearly a half hour after our scheduled pickup time. This was disappointing and inconvenient, since we had selected that pickup time to best fit our schedule. Will not order takeout from this place again."}
{"text":"You should go to this particular BW3 if you enjoy going to places like Chuck E Cheese. I believe most parents come here because they can't find a babysitter yet they still want their beer and wing fix. It is not uncommon for children to be running around unsupervised. But I guess this is what you should expect from any establishment with video games geared for children right in the middle of the restaurant. On a past visit my wife had a chair at our table rammed into by a woman pushing a baby stroller. Who takes a baby out after 10 on a Saturday night? Another boy, probably 12 years old, rammed into the back of her chair while chasing one of friends down. Yes, chasing. In a restaurant.   The service here is usually good. The food quality never changes which is also a good thing. For the life of me I don't understand why the prices increase every time I go here. $11 for a dozen wings is quite expensive. I understand they have shareholders to appease, but eventually they will price themselves out of business. There are many locally owned restaurants in the area with just as good or better food quality and more reasonable prices, such as the Winking Lizard and Cleats."}
{"text":"The wings at this location is trash. I always request for my wings to be extra crispy and everytime it never fails. I get them and they look as if they were taken out early and slimy. Its every time! Ive tried this location on multiple occasions and its the same problem everytime! Better not get anyone sick!"}
{"text":"Pretty good as Buffalo Wild Wings go.  Very clean. Good service. The wings were not dry and were very flavorful. They gave out free samples of a new beer, and I love that.   Not as many people here as I would expect on a Tuesday night. There was a regular crew at the bar, but I expected more out-of-towners being so close to a number of hotels. It was a little hard to get to, but that could just be Pittsburgh driving."}
{"text":"Great service,  from beginning to end. Both Roman and the cook were both amazing!! They kept checking up on us and the food was great. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Typically upbeat staff! Also  very kid friendly, they gave my Lil one a tablet to wait for her food which came  out  asap!"}
{"text":"Great food. Best wings in my life. Friendly staff. And most important clean place and fresh food."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger and sweet potato fries... I left hungry and frustrated for the overpriced burger with half a dozen of fries in my plate. :("}
{"text":"Nice chain, had the Caesar salad with grilled chicken blackened. Dressing on the side, was very good to my surprise. Large selection of IPA's on tap. Ate at the bar, service was great and also with a smile!"}
{"text":"I cant get enough of this place!!! Love going here on a regular basis for football season."}
{"text":"Well I typically do not take the time to write reviews but I feel like it is necessary today. I had a party of originally 15 people to celebrate a going away party for a close friend. We ended up with 20+people attend. The staff was great in accommodating our party and even though it's a Friday night, full house, they were able to provide us with more seats! We had one waiter for the entire group. Anthony(waiter) was fast, efficient,and very friendly! Great,great guy! Thank you,BDUBS, for the great experience !!"}
{"text":"I've been to Buffalo Wild Wings several times now.  I gotta say, never been very happy with the food.  Service at this particular location was excellent.  Wes was our bartender and I gotta say, phenomenal service. But the food has disappointed way too many times. I've had several wraps and several appetizers, all of which were lacking the key ingredients. My steak wrap was definitely near steakless.  It had been awhile since eating at other locations, but I recall the same type of stingy-with-key-ingredients disappointment.   A buddy of mine swears that you should only ever order the wings. Never try for any other food item because you will be disappointed. Apparently, the wings are alright.  The things saving this place from a one-star review is the amazing service that I received at this one particular location, the number of TVs with games on, and the beer happy hour special.   Enjoy this picture of my lettuce wrap with fraction of an ounce of steak in it.  btw, I ate the half with less steak first because I wanted to save the better half for last, so this is the meatier half. Sigh."}
{"text":"This is a typical BW3 but being a far enough away from the casinos you get a different experience. We sat at a table in the bar so we were helped by the bartender. I didn't catch his name but he was very friendly and attentive. The wings are always consistent so I was very satisfied. I'm glad we decided on lunch here!"}
{"text":"The service here is ridiculous.   Came  here on a Sunday, and there were a few large parties...but they mostly  looked like children's sports team celebrating a game or a birthday  or something.   We were sat in a booth, and a waiter walked by us and said that he would be right with us.   Well... ten minutes later, we're sitting. No one has approached us, given us water, not even a sideways glance.  In the booth behind us, there is 3 kids clearing plates. Like....really, isnt that a one person job? We ask for water, and the kid brings back a SINGLE  glass of water.  There's  three of us. I guess we were  supposed to share ?   Got up and walked out."}
{"text":"Ask for Craig. The BEST server ever!!! He was a ninja! My iced tea would barely get down to half full and a new one just showed up. Every time. We never had to ask for anything. He was ON it!! Smart. Fast. Friendly. Not intrusive. We barely knew he was there. We were just taken care of. Then, when we did have a back and forth with him, he was polite, friendly and fun. To top it all off... I accidentally left my cell phone on the table when we left the resturant. He ran... not jogged a bit hoping to catch us but, if not, big deal... no... he, outta breath when he caught us, hollering to get us to stop, SPRINTED, across two parking lots, to catch us before we pulled out into the street, to bring me my phone. Freak'n awesome!!! Great wings! Big and meaty and cooked just right. Lots of sauce choices. Great appetizers. Good iced tea. Tons of TV's. They were even very friendly and accommodating whe we asked if they could try to find us a hockey game. What a great experience!"}
{"text":"THEY HAVE A FOOD CHALLENGE HERE!  12 Blazzin' Hot Wings  6 Minutes to Finish them No Drinks No Sauces No Napkins.....  Eternal Greatness......  (In the form of a sweet shirt, check out the pic!)  on top of the rest of the goodness, great wings, great selection of beer, great staff..... I love this place.....  So if you think you can handle the HOTTEST OF THE HOT, then come here and order their Wing Challenge!!!  (note: the heat comes from the temperature of the wings, and the 20 minutes after.... order a side of celery for the aftermath cause that shitz is HOT!)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience Yesterday here.  The food, wings, steak wrap, jalapeño poppers and a couple of  kid meals where whAt you would expect - good however, the server, made it especially good.  She was kind and very prompt.  She made sure our kids were taken care of and we never had to ask for anything.  She was wonderful. She was rewarded with a big compliment to the manger and a very generous tip. Thank you so much Vern. You are awesome!"}
{"text":"This location is pretty good! Got my order right, friendly staff and prompt service. The location is a bit of a pain to get to but that's everything on eastern. Got my 20 piece traditional extra Crispy and they came out great. Highly recommend extra Crispy!"}
{"text":"This place was da bomb the food was delicious the service was better than ever and the drink was refreshing place to go anytime any day of the week"}
{"text":"Your average BW3. I would have given 3 1/2 stars. The wings may seem pricey, but they are always good quality wings. Family friendly atmosphere, if you're seated away from the bar. I think the staff tries to make accommodations when they're not super busy. On the discount wing nights takeout is better. I dine in maybe twice a year and get takeout 3-4 times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this Buffalo Wild Wings. The wings are always taste wonderful, and are never dry...even on wing night, which I find to be a problem at a lot of other restaurants. The other food I've had from the menu is always good too. The main thing I love about BWW is how wonderful the service is. I've never ha a bad experience with a server here. The are always extremely attentive and pleasant. If you want wings and a good dining experience, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is good. Had an issue with them skipping all our songs on touchtunes, but they fixed it."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing. Love this place. Would not change a thing! The food is great and the tv's always bring up a great conversation starter. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ok, so we decided to give this place another try on a Saturday afternoon, when I had a mild hangover. I wasn't expecting much based on my last experience but sometimes the hangover belly just wants what it wants and this day it was saying chips with cheese!  When we entered we were greeted and I asked to be seated at a booth. The host had to clean it off and did so without attitude which made me happy. Our waitresses was nice, to the point where she was almost too nice, you know the type, but she got the job done and the much needed food to us in a timely manner so that's all I could ask for.  All in all, I guess I still have a bad taste in my mouth from the first experience here but after this time I will be happy to go back and give them another try since I'm still a sucker for the food."}
{"text":"I've honestly had nothing but good experiences here, so was rather surprised to see how low the reviews were. The food is decent, and the beer is cold and cheap. They have awesome mixed drinks to choose from and they are very reasonably priced. $5 bloody mary?   I have had excellent service every time and I enjoy the loud atmosphere during crowded sports events.  It's a BWW; a chain restaurant. Don't expect fine dining, but it's not bad either. They offer great wing specials. I am a huge fan of the boneless parmesan garlic or hot. The cheese bacon fries are my favorite appetizers. They sprinkle them with salt and vinegar seasoning. I like dipping mine in ranch!   The service is hit or miss at this location."}
{"text":"The service here flat out stinks. I couldn't hold my tongue any longer and I'm finally writing a review after my fifth visit in the last 3 months. Each visit, the service gets progressively worse (which is mind blowing). The only saving grace here are the lemon pepper seasoned wings which for some reason are never accompanied with the sauce I ask for. I specifically ask for 3 bleu cheese dressings and even tell them \"to charge me if necessary\", but somehow ranch ALWAYS makes it to the table. I will no longer be dining at this Buffalo Wild Wings. The proximity to my house along with the excellent lemon pepper seasoning will no longer be my justification to eat at this hospitality lacking restaurant."}
{"text":"I haven't gone to BWW for a long time but will start going again if I want the buffalo wings. They were very good. The wait staff filled our drinks and it didn't really matter if it was our usual waiter. If one of the waiters noticed our drinks getting low they would fill them. The atmosphere was pretty decent."}
{"text":"I wouldn't mind coming to this location to eat and watch TV because the food and the menu and the wings all seem like they have a great selection. Place is very spacious and open and there are plenty of servers to help out when you need it. The only reason I would not continue coming to this place is because they blast the music so loud but you cannot hear anybody three feet away from you. Even the waiters have issues trying to get your order and have to yell back at you over the loud music. Went there last night to have wings at 130 in the morning and sure enough the music was so loud that we thought if we ever want to have wings again to bring our ear plugs with us."}
{"text":"My friends and I had to just walk out of this location because the service was so bad today. First, I opened my menu and there was wet sauce inside. Then, we sat at our table for 20 minutes without a waiter or waitress stopping by our table at all. At that point, the hostess was seating another group, so we asked her if she could send over our waiter because we had been waiting a while. A moment later, the waiter appeared, walked right past our table and began talking to the group that the hostess had just seated. In the amount of time we waited, we could have gotten carry-out and been on our way."}
{"text":"food is great! do remember its a sports bar!"}
{"text":"Very very very slow service.    Our waitress was nice but she would disappear for long periods of time.  She did add some of our order to the happy hour even though it was a few minutes past due to her absence which was appreciated.  The food is just bar food.  Nothing really worth coming for.  There are a ton of tvs with sports and beer which is what most people come for.  The wings are okay.  Habanero mango and chile rub were the two best.   Curry was not great Garlic was okay Honey BBQ was okay Fire was not hot enough  The burger was pretty decent.  Nicely cooked and a good amount of toppings.  No culinary gem but a decent sports bar in a great location."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people love this place. I think its seriously overrated. At least for food. Sure, the atmosphere for games/UFC is awesome and they do have an extensive bar. But just to dine I'd say is pretty mediocre. The wings are small, but I will say the sauces are pretty good. I had the Chili Garlic, Garlic Parm and the Wild. All we're actually good. Everything else was just ok. All of the appetizers seem like they just take them out of the frozen food bag and drop them into the fryer. Nothing stood out, it tastes like fast food. Service is good. But next time I'll just goto PT's or Village Pub."}
{"text":"Almost didn't go inside this BWW because of the \"poor service\" review, but, took a chance.  Upon entering, there was nobody there to greet all of the customers who were there before us.  We looked to our left and saw 4 female servers just standing in the corner at a waiting station, laughing, talking, & texting.  To our right, at what looked like a bar service counter, there were 3 male servers stand kiing there chatting & joking around with the female behind the counter,   We stood for about 2 minutes as the ladies on the left all turned to look at us.  My husband walked around the reception counter & wall as the employees just continued laughing, talking &  texting.  As he came around, he said, \"Let's leave since nobody around here seems to not want to serve and seat any of us.\". One of the parties waiting ahead of us agreed with him, turned, & walked out.  The other party had kids and the father said, \"Let's go somewhere else kids.  Seems like the employees would prefer to socialize on company time than to serve paying customers.\". As they started walking out, we were greeted by a hostess/server ahead of the family of 5 who was there before us, but, were walking out.  We didn't notice if they stayed or not, as we were happy somebody finally noticed us and seated us.  Throughout our entire dining, we often noticed serving staff gathered in groups of 4-6 people standing around socializing or texting.  This is the first time we.have experienced seeing this type of lackadaisical attitude by serving staff at any restaurant.  I snapped several pictures of what we were seeing.  In the attached photo, there are actually other persons standing there but are blocked from view by other servers, for a total of 6.    Our server, Claire, was exceptional.  Not once did we catch her jus changing out with her coworkers.  She was always busy serving her customers."}
{"text":"Yummy! If you are craving Wings then you should definitely get some from this place! So many options for sauces...and great for take out as well. I personally love the Asian zing and the salt and vinegar. So good! And messy :)"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out with a friend. I had tried their SE location and was left wanting... Overall, it was ok, not good or great, just ok. Service was pretty good, even if the servers seem really young with little experience, but they were friendly! The wings were ok, I have had much better. The Parmesan Garlic wings were pretty good, the other flavors we ordered kinda just tasted about the same, yes they tasted ok/good, but not really WOW! The sweet potato fries were good too, but again, there are much better elsewhere. Would I be back? Well maybe, if I am with a group of friends that want to go, and I admit, I do want to try their popcorn shrimp! So lets go watch lots of tv screens!"}
{"text":"Great wings. We went on Saturday night around 5:30. Seated quickly. Waiter was a tad slow but overall we had a good experience. This is our 3rd time at this location. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Servers do not pay attention when called upon. And hostess has been having a 10 minute conversation with another employee. To top it all off they got my order wrong."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, we got there and nobody had any idea what they were doing. After sitting for what seemed forever we got a seat, the waiter came promptly took our drink order and came back fairly quick, so far so good, right.  After asking for sweet and low for my tea we didn't see the waiter again for close to 10 minutes. When he returned to take our order I still had no sweet and low, asking again giving him the benefit of the doubt I didn't receive any until I asked the manager. Our food was delivered by another server and it came out cold and hard, we all ran out of drinks with no refills and didn't see our waiter again until it was time to pay. Our bill totaled $33.44 I gave the waiter a gift card with $25 on it and my bank card to put the rest on. He came back with a receipt showing $8.44, thinking it was right I tipped him $8.56 (much more than he deserved) after going to the movies I checked my bank account online the waiter charged the entire bill on my card and pocketed the gift card. Horrible service, gross food and a thief. Guess I now have to fight a battle tomorrow."}
{"text":"Nothing special, I expected more form this place. If I was taken on a date to this place there would not be a second date.  I've had beater food, better  and beater service, then this place. the only good things was the beer and time wasted at a decent costs."}
{"text":"Ok so this is a big chain and it's cool to come and watch a game and have some drinks. The food is just ok and I love wings but I asked for them to be extra crispy and they weren't. They also had no sauce so I had to ask for extra. Our waitress was super sweet and took good care of us. Overall it's not that bad as long as you know what your going to get. I think it's a great social place to be with friends but honestly the wings in my opinion were just ok."}
{"text":"You can't really criticize BWW for the mediocre food served in paper boats and dressing packets for salads.  They are a national company that seems to be doing something right considering their success.  However, you'd think such success would translate to some kind of service standard.    I can tell from other reviews that I am not the only one that received remarkably bad service at this place.  It was the ASU v. UofA football game and the place was overflowing.  According to our server, the shortage of bartenders justified our second round of drinks taking more than an hour. MORE THAN AN HOUR!!!  Unfortunately for him, the lack of bartenders could not be blamed for the food taking even longer.    At one point, after checking three times to see if a runner had brought our drinks, someone got up from the table to ask him if they were ever going to come.  His response, \"You didn't order more drinks.\"  Let me say that again.  He checked back with us three times to see if we had gotten a round of drinks that, according to him, we never ordered.  Confused???  So were we.   If they keep this up, they won't last much longer than Six Shooters."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice for lunch. The \"Fast Break\" lunch is a good deal with plenty of food and prices ranging from $5.99 to $7.99. Last time I got the street tacos and this time I got the Buffalito, both times served with a house side salad.   I'd order either one again, although the pico is a bit heavy on the onion so maybe get that on the side. They deliver on the 'under-15-minute-promise' and service was friendly.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food at all, chicken was dry. Was offered outdoor seating with misters but they forgot to mention being surrounded by smokers and the misters weren't working. Manager did his best along with our second waitress, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful summer night and I was in company of my favorite lady who treated me, a shameless wing snob, to dinner at BW3 in wonderful Champaign IL  Dining at his location was a very pleasant surprise. We were seated immediately and moved to a booth as requested and were waited on in the most timely manner courtesy of the lovely and super friendly Taylor, aka Tat-Tay.   We ordered a pair of tall Dos Equis off the tap and four orders of hot wings.  HOT! (one of the very best flavored wings I've ever had) CARIBBEAN JERK BUFFALOSEASONING SALT & VINEGAR SEASONING  I was in disbelief at how quickly our order was delivered. The atmosphere given the fact that the NFL was back in season was enjoyable. Being I'm not a sports fan I've found that BW3 at most times is annoying though the wings are some of the best. I could actually converse with my date and they even had the jukebox playing which in the Chicagoland region is a rarity . The wings were superb, some of the best I've ever had and the service was second to none. Thanks Taylor.   I really want to come back here when in the area."}
{"text":"Regarding visit 4/4/18.  In the past, i've not been really impressed with BBW.  I hadn't been back in over a year, and thought i'd try it again with my family.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed once again.  The service was GREAT, but our food was down right... eh.  Mediocre, at best.  We ordered the newer Pretzel appetizer.  The cheese that came with it was great.  The pretzel would have been great, too.  If it wasn't for the fourteen pounds of salt that came on it.  Seriously--I think there was more salt than pretzel.  See picture from my visit.  I had the buffalo chicken wrap..and everything in it was barely 'ok'.  It tasted like it had been sitting out for an hour or two before being served.  Bland, barely any toppings, quickly thrown together, and.. old?"}
{"text":"Sehr guter Laden zum Wings essen, ob mit oder wie ich sie am liebsten habe ohne Knochen. Es kann zwischen ca. 15 verschiednen Saucen gewählt werden. Ich hatte auf ein paar Wings \"nur\" die drittschärfste Sauce und ich stand kurz vor der Selbstentzündung :). Wie in einer anständigen Sportsbar hängen dort unzählige Fernseher. Das Personal ist super nett. Der Laden selber ist ein wenig weg vom Strip, aber doch noch recht zentral gelegen."}
{"text":"Love bww back in Washington, move back to Vegas and for some reason this store has really big issues with everything. Have given this place so many chances because I love bww!! This store is just terrible when it comes to customer service, ordering over the phone they are just terribly rude, they have gotten my order wrong 3 times now!! One time I had to wait an hour in the store to get my new order which I always get extra crispy wings, well I get home to find they were not, oh and when I actually went to get the manager to remind here after the hour of waiting she was surprised it had already been an hour and had totally forgot, I guess this could be because it was 12 am idk. The only time I seem to get good service here is when I come after work which is 7am and the bartender always gives great service! He is some ex army guy and always really cool and makes sure my order is correct I just don't know why I can't get the same service every time!!! And he is the only reason I'm giving this place a 2 star review. This store needs to do way better"}
{"text":"Ate here today because I had a mailer for discount for lunch.  Ordered the 8-piece boneless wings with fries lunch and sweet tea.  The food took less than five minutes from order to table, very fast. The boneless wings (covered in medium sauce) were cooked perfectly: hot (temperature), not dry inside, and crispy outside.  The fries were crispy and the sweet tea was good.  Staff kept coming by the table asking if I needed anything else.  Overall excellent service, the food was indeed better than I would expect from a chain, and will likely go again in the near future."}
{"text":"The incompetence of this BWW is ridiculous. This establishment is half empty on a Monday night yet still have a one hour waiting list. We came in with a group of 7 and they started to seat many smaller tables before us - even after we had already told them we were okay with splitting our group in half. After waiting for four more parties of 3-4 get seated before us, they proceed to seat our party separately in different tables. There are 2 empty tables next to the ones we've been seated at and they refuse to push them together (stating that it will interfere with the logistics).  After not taking our order for 15 minutes (after we explicitly stated we were ready to order), we see them push the two empty tables together to seat a table of 8, who are not even fully present.   Their refusal to work with their customers and inconsistency is a huge deterrent for eating here. While the food of BWW is consistent and delicious, the service here is appalling."}
{"text":"As with most chain restaurants, what you expect from one you can expect from another.   Despite the excessive amount of people that were in attendance the last time I went, we still managed to get a great booth, and even better customer service. My cup never truly emptied before it was refilled again, and anytime I needed something, there was always someone available to help.  The menu is pretty standard no matter where you go, however I managed to try a new entree item that I must recommend. The Shrimp Po Boy sandwich was by far the most  delicious thing i've tasted this side of the Mississippi. Great seafood that wasn't soggy or overly fried and complimented by just the right amount of southern spice. What's not to like?  Pair this with a side of fries and a delicious ale, and you have yourself quite the palate pleaser.   While I don't frequent BWW often, I will definitely make it a point to stop in and try any of their new menu items when the chance comes!  p.s. Did I mention that you may be befuddled by the pure joy of having any and all sports events available to you simultaneously? I didn't? Well... you may just have to experience it for yourself... because by golly it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I go to a lot of BWWs and this location is one of the worse. Their bathrooms are disgusting and rarely cleaned.  The manager is over whelmed and has no control over his staff or restaurant.  His staff is complains about how they are over staffed and that's why we had to wait 30 mins to get our drinks refilled.  The only reason I didn't give them one star is because Ron is a great waiter and cares about his customers.  My daughter loves the cinnamon bites and was so excited to order them after Ron said how great they were. They ended up being out of them.  If your in the area drive the extra 5 mins to the location on Craig."}
{"text":"Nasty alert! Ok me and the wife figured we would go get some wings  Order a beer for her and a pop for me We was talking and she took a drink  And she almost swallowed a toothpick Yes that's right used toothpick in her glass! Well needless to say don't bother going to this brand new establishment it's flat out gross We did get offered a new beer ! And told that it came from a dishwasher  Even more nasty if you ask me ! 2-12-2014 at 4 pm"}
{"text":"Thought out service and food were great!  I had the Caribbean jerk boneless. Hot hot hot but this these are wonderful!  Came in to watch a game. Thought the service was right on.  Thanks guys"}
{"text":"So actually we had a pretty bad experience here this time around...So why the 4 stars right?  Well me and 2 friends went here for lunch today and we waited nearly 50 minutes to get our food.  That's a crazy long time.  Turns out they had a problem with their system and because of the issues, our order probably got lost.  We assume that's what happened when the bartender serving us asked what sauces we wanted again about 30 minutes in to our wait.  Well the food was good once we got it and a manager came over and talked to us to explain the system issues.  She said she would discount the check for us.  Turns out she discounted the whole thing, so despite waiting for a long time the food and drinks ended up being free.  Can't beat free!!!  So I gave this 4 stars because I respect places that recognize when they screwed up and are willing to give us a free meal in order to maintain our business for the future.  So many places want to just shut you up and not really do much for you, but 3 guys eating meals for free because you messed up is a good example of what they should be doing to keep customers happy.  I may not come here on my 1 hour lunch break very often because of this, but I will go back again other times."}
{"text":"I love the sauces, but the wings themselves aren't great.  I now start eating the boneless strips just because the wings have been subpar.  Service is usually pretty good here.  Spicy Garlic might just be my favorite wing sauce period."}
{"text":"YEEAAAEEEEE YEEEAAAAEEEEEE!!!!! B-Dubs never dissapoints, gots to town & threw down on some BANGIN wings all to wash it down with the CHEAPEST BEER IN TOWN!!!!!! Thanx to all over there doin it how it should be done!!!!"}
{"text":"We went around dinner time and the place was pretty busy. The wings were pretty tasty and the potato wedges were crisp. Why the 1 star? I will definitely say the service we received last night was completely unacceptable. We were seated and the waitress got our drinks. We placed our order and everything was fine. However another party came in that was slightly larger than ours and our waitress completely ignored us. Our food took long enough as it was but on top of that our waitress didn't even bring out our food. Another waitress did and I asked for a side of ranch both initially and when the food was brought out. To get a small bit of ranch took almost 15 minutes to receive and that waitress didn't even bring that to us. What's concerning was not the time it took to get our food but the fact that we seemed to be tossed from server to server throughout the night. Our original waitress finally came back...with the bill just handed to us and no apology for her lackluster service. Overall as much as we would love to be patrons of Buffalo Wild Wings we will not be returning to this one."}
{"text":"I love this place, great staff, great food. Everytime I go, it is consistent with great food and quick service. THIS PLACE ROCKS"}
{"text":"We went to Buffalo Wild Wing on Tuesday because of there $.50 cent special and I LOVE this place! It was somewhat already busy during lunch time but was seated rather quickly. Our service was just okay but the food was amazing. I ordered the Spicy Garlic and Hot flavor (which wasn't that hot) and they were perfect! I am definitely gonna start going to the BWW here in Honolulu and can't wait. :)"}
{"text":"I don't really understand why people go here.  Every once in a while, I'll be hanging out with the boyfriend's friends and someone will say \"Let's go to Buffalo Wild WIngs!\"  Why?!  As true for most chains,  this place is completely uninspired.  Boring menu full of greasy, gross food.  Boring, overpriced drinks.  Downtown Kent has a whole host of local bars that sell better drinks at cheaper prices.  Is it the patio here that appeals to you?  Go the the Zephyr- there's is better.  And you can eve get Taco Tanto's from Zephyr's patio, and god knows Taco Tanto's has much better food than Buffalo Wild Wings.  You can't say it's the drinks that draw you in, because even their \"specialty\" drinks taste terrible.  So what is it?  Do you think going to a \"sports bar\" is the cool thing to do?  Newsflash: Nearly every bar in downtown Kent is showing the game.  You don't need to go to a \"sports bar\" to see it.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"awesome food with great service! I love this place! the only thing I think is a little annoying is when their \"experience captains\" come around, Im just trying to enjoy my food and conversations! Other than that everything is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"This location has horrible customer service and oder preparation timeliness. I placed my order online at 6 pm for 7 pm pickup and it was nowhere near ready. When I asked why it wasn't ready I wad given the excuse that we are all human and can't have everything on time. What is the point of asking for a pickup time if it isn't even started when I get there to pick it up. I will never go back to this location and the manager Julie was beyond non-helpful. Not one person's order was ready when it was supposed to be ready. Horrible way to run a business!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here about once a month and I have to say, the food AND the service is Hit or Miss. Beer on Draft is good, but still.... should it really cost $100+ for a small family to have a \"decent\" meal?"}
{"text":"I give it a 4 because of the consistency  we get when we come here. We always sit at that bar and they have an awesome Happy Hour menu, appetizers for $3 and certain alcohol like Absolut vodka for $3. We get our wings naked extra crispy with sauce on the side and the wings still come out juicy and not dry at all. We stick to mango habanero which is sweet and has heat to it (a little goes a long way!) last night we tried the spicy garlic sauce which has a good combination of sweet and spicy, it almost taste like garlic aioli."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great, but when the manager David came to check on us he was phenomenal! Great people skills, relatable and very funny! My husband and I enjoyed his company even for just a short time.  Great manager!"}
{"text":"Every few years, I gotta update these reviews for no other reason than to update the review. The last few bartenders have been kind of boring, but they had a pretty cool bearded guy on hand recently. He was very efficient on drink refills and conversation. We also shared the Yankees/Red Sox fight and he even put the closed captions on the TV to give further information on the game.   The have a new limited time sauce called Crimson Clover, but I did not find this one that tasty. It was the only sauce that had a better aftertaste than initial taste. It was tomato based, but this was not a great sauce. The mozzarella sticks are still $4 at Happy Hour and the large beers are like $3.25, so it's still a good deal. Stick to the basics here and things will be fine."}
{"text":"Horrible service, no cheese in mozzarella sticks, no water refills, and we heard the manager yelling at his employees. Very unhappy with whole experience."}
{"text":"Who would eat here and why?  Ordered a burger and fries.  Waited about 25 minutes and the place was 30% full at best.  Small portion of fries, decent burger, and a drink and it was 20 bucks with a tip.  I just can't understand how this place is in business.  I wish I went to Smashburger next door.  I would have spent half the price and been in and out of there in 10 minutes at most.  I really don't understand how this place is in business."}
{"text":"From California and I came to Las Vegas for the first time. Anyways the food here was up to par with the other BWW's. My server was Jessie and her service was impeccable!!! 5stars for her--she was so attentive. I wasn't feeling good due and she offered me soda water and lemons to make it taste better"}
{"text":"Food is hit and miss. When they get it right it's pretty good, was much better before they closed and reopened.  It is to loud to enjoy at rush hour, so we usually get it to go."}
{"text":"Great place to eat; great atmosphere; and centrally located. I absolutely love this place and I love the wings I will always come back!"}
{"text":"Do not go here. I usually have an okay experience but I physically had to flag someone down and ask to be assisted after being seated for 40 minutes. The waitress replied with, \"I am on break, so ask someone else that is clearly working.\" The place was not packed and it was before the evening dinner rush. If you are going to eat here, go straight to the bar seating because you will be served quicker. Normal seating is HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"BDubs is always a hit to go watch a game, enjoy a brew, and spend time with a group of your friends. Service is consistent and no matter where you are sitting you most likely will have a good view of the television. They have a pretty good happy hour and for a chain the wings are decent. This place is in a good location, staff is friendly, and you will not be disappointed if you have. A group of friends together to go watch a game. Besides beer, mixed drinks, and apps, I cannot comment on the food. I have never gone to wild wings for lunch or dinner. They also have automated poker and trivia."}
{"text":"I am at Buffalo Wild Wings, on a boneless wing night. The food is ok, but the service here is horrible!!! My party of 2 and I have the worst server ever in the history of servers. He told us 2 times that he was to busy to take are order, then ran off. We never saw him again until the check came. Then when the food runner brought out are food she forgot half of are order. Then they forgot the celery and carrots. I will never eat at this Buffalo Wild Wings again! And neither should you!"}
{"text":"Server was nice but clearly hates her job. Service stunk- chefs seemed to hate their jobs too bc the food was bad and when we sent food back it came back just as bad as the first time...and we NEVER send food back. We are Ohioans, been fans of BW-3 for decades but this ended it for us."}
{"text":"Sorry, I just don't see the appeal in this place.  I'm not exactly a Hooters fanatic, but I'll take their wings over this place any day.  Correction: I'll take any other restaurant's wings over this place any day.  There is just something funny with the wings here, perhaps it's the fact that they think sour means spicy? The wings are overwhelmingly drenched in this smelly, sour 'hot sauce', that taste like rancid, sweaty socks. I'm thinking it's just me. Very little meat on them, if any.. not very juicy, and hard to naw off. But as I try out the side salad and fries.. yup, my preconceived notions were confirmed. Just mediocore food at a mediocore sports bar. Even the waitress looked like she was bored outta her mind. Typical and very underwhelming. Why did I even bother. Worst wing place I've ever been to, hands down.  Save your $8 and buy yourself a cheap bag of Tyson's chicken wings from the grocery store. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Went here to watch the Heat game last night and it was surprisingly empty- there was maybe 10 other people in the whole place- I don't know if this location is struggling or what but I assumed we would have to wait for 45 minutes to get a table during play off games.   Now, I have been to Bw3 before, so I knew what I was getting myself into: mediocre but cheap food and wings, but a million TVs/cheap drinks. If that tradeoff doesn't seem like what you are looking for you probably want to go elsewhere.   I will say that the TV situation was a little out of control. 90% of the TV's were showing hockey (bleh) or baseball (boring) which I didn't even know were still sports. The sound was also on the hockey play by play which is super interesting except the exact opposite.   The service was good- drink refills were brought in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"If you like to wait for mediocre food than this is your spot.  Half empty restaurant on a Saturday evening and waited 35+ minutes for my sons 4 piece wing meal, my daughters 4 piece chicken tender meal and my wrap.  No sight of a manager to address this with after it was very apparent our waitress knew I was upset and my kids were starving."}
{"text":"Our server was great..  ! It wasn't very busy ,we got sat right away,everyone was nice even the manager stopped by to see how we were doing that rarely happens at bdubs, overall probably the best Buffalo wild wings that I have ever visited"}
{"text":"Service was fast, server was great, I don't see why so many people on here write bad reviews about this place,will be returning"}
{"text":"Good shit. Good all around service. The food was prompt and the beer was ice cold.  Fuck it don't need much more. Plus is happy hour till 6am. So can't complain."}
{"text":"Horrible service! They didn't pay attention to us at all. The waitress were really rude! Took us about 20 minutes to get our drink and to order when we've had already told them 15 minutes before that we were ready when given straws they were throw at us by the waitress. After we got our food they were never asking if we wanted a refill unless we asked."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy night. Took our waiter 20 minutes to actually acknowledge us. Then, took almost another 15 minutes just to get our drink. And the worst part was that it took nearly an entire hour for us to get our food and nobody who worked there checked up on us. Poor customer service? yes. I understand, that at times, it can be very busy, but to not check up on your customers is very rude.   When we finally received our food, my burger was very soggy. The buns were wet. It is NOT the best, just ok food I guess. Eh, probably won't go back, not worth it!"}
{"text":"We order takeout here regularly. The online ordering system is so easy, anyone can use it. I do wish it allowed for a bit more detail in the notes section, but overall perfect.   The food is always fantastic and I can't seem to get enough of their onion rings.   The staff is always helpful, but more important nice and consistent. I can expect the same routine no matter who cashes me out.   Price wise, it's not cheap but it is not expensive either. Right in the middle."}
{"text":"I just tried to order wings for take out. Not only was the person that answered the phone ignoring me because she was talking to someone in the restaurant she wasn't knowledgable about the menu and wouldn't help me with what I wanted to order. Apparently you can't order a specific number of wings that are listed on their menu on days that they do not have wing night. They are a wing place so I am not sure how this makes sense. And you cannot get a variety of sauces for your wings. I ordered my wings from Dominos down the street instead. Great decision."}
{"text":"Dirty dirty dirty, that's sums it up.  We walked in went towards the bar area. I immediately noticed the place wasn't clean including the floors. The bar area was even worse, many empty tables that weren't bussed and the ones that were weren't wiped down. They weren't even busy, there's no excuse for this. This place is gross there's no way I'd ever eat here.  Pick something else when you go out, something clean."}
{"text":"yummy yummy!   i love going for happy hour with my friends! it's good food and good drinks, what more could you ask for?   only thing is depending on when you go there tends to be a rather long wait. it's best to go on a weekday or when there isn't a huge game playing.  if there's a game and you don't care about it, then don't go. there's no point in waiting when everyone is there to watch so they'll never leave haha i love the lakers, but i don't want to go watch them lose (they've been doing a lot of that lately) just because the food is cheap. But that's just my opinion haha"}
{"text":"Service was great. Lots of TVs, large seating area, very spacious.   The poutine was lacking in cheese. It was shredded mozzarella, so not a great poutine. Didn't get the wing sauce on it, thought that would be a bit much with the gravy. The seasoned wedges were good, but the potion wasn't very big."}
{"text":"I've given this place so many chances, but it's officially too bad to return to. It's a shame because the location and interior are really nice, but the service is so consistently slow and unattentive, the place is always dirty, drinks sit on the bar waiting to be picked up for your table even when there's no one else there. Clearly a management and training issue. Such a waste."}
{"text":"This is by far the most horrible BWW we have ever been to!  I ordered extra extra crispy wings because slimy and soft chicken skin makes me gag!  The chicken was not even crispy at all!  Then when the server asked how our food was I told her about it and she just looked at me and said OH!  Ugh!!  Then I had to ask multiple times for carrots and celery and when the server brought them out, there was literally 2 pieces of celery and slivers of carrots!    This experience just ruined it for me and as long as I can help it, I will not be returning to any BWW!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Buffalo Wild Wings on earth in my opinion haha.. Let me start going into detail on why this place is terrible.. I arrived here around 10:00 which is two hours before their closing time. Walked in and saw that only a couple groups were in there being a it was a Monday night.. We walked up to the booth and there was no server there.. We waited for about 3 minutes before a girl approached us.. She told us sit anywhere we want so I was walking and she goes \"don't pass the right side\" so there goes sit anywhere.. We sat down ordered drinks and food and I'm waiting and waiting and I don't even see the server to even ask her where my appetizer is. She comes out with the food 35 minutes later and it was only us and another group sitting in this Buffalo Wild Wings. My fries were cold my wings were cold and my fried pickles were cold hahaha crazy how most of these food were fried and came out cold.. I didn't even want to bother with it being already late so I just paid and left but now I know I learned my lesson. Get your stuff together BWW!!"}
{"text":"On 06/24/17 I had chicken wings. One of my had feathers, and the feathers were long. I was unable to eat all of the wings, so packed the remainder in a to go box. I didn't notice until got home. It was gross!! The server, Amber was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for small children!!! Your leather lunged kid could scream and scream and scream, and would simply blend in with non-stop din of the other small kids and blaring televisions. Just like the  departure lounge going to Orlando at an airport!! The food is made for children, frozen boneless chicken fingers and fries, just like at home. Kids can and do wipe their hands on all surfaces available, so you don't even have to think about cleaning up after them. Everything is really, really sticky! Many families have found this place to be excellent, they fill the place. Bon Appetit!!"}
{"text":"Got back to Madison, and when we got here, everyone is wearing green! Great! I love football. Afterwards, we sat down, and ordered beer and wings.   We were always surprised during the game because the TVs were inconsistent. Some of them were delayed so the reactions were delayed as well compared to some people.   The service and employees were both good, but the food is decent at best. It tastes similar to something you can microwave and eat. For the price you pay, it's not that great."}
{"text":"My favorite part of all BWW is the # of sauces to choose from.  Most recently I tried Hot BBQ for the first time and I really likes it.  Spicy Garlis is still my fav, as well as the really hot ones like Blazin and WILD.  You should order the wings \"WET\" or order a side of sauce becuase they often do not have enough sauce mixed onto the wings.   Good place to eat, and HEY Cold Stone is right next door, so you get your HEAT with wings and COLD with some Ice Cream afterwards."}
{"text":"I love the selection of flavor that they have for the wings. They also offer boneless or bone-in. Both are yummy!  The french fries are BOOOOOMB :) Staff is friendly.  I have had some dry wings before. They were bland."}
{"text":"Worst location I have been to. I won't be back. Food was poor and they had a charity event in the front area where you wait for seating which made for an uncomfortable situation.   I can appreciate the community involvement but I don't agree with solicitation at my table while I am eating.   The chicken was pretty bad. The boneless wings were over cooked. Hard and crunchy not to mention 2x more batter than chicken but I would imagine they come frozen. The bone in wings were also hard and chewy. It's the first time I did not eat all my food."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! The service was horrible! After ordering drinks we did it receive them for 20 minutes. Complained to management, still took an additional 10 minutes. Asked for ranch never revived it."}
{"text":"I usually go here for lunch. Great service. Love the hostes Claudia! :) Great place."}
{"text":"I came here because I love the buffalo wild wings back at home. I didn't have high expectations since I came in and the place was pretty much empty. But we got greated by the most uplifting server I have ever met!!! This girl was on top of it, had so much spunk and made me and my husband peeing in our pants! (Martika) the best thing that's happened to us in Vegas so far. The food was amazing like always but with a kick of awesome service. I feel Vegas service should have a little bit of martika in their step, people come here for entertainment and that's what we got even far from the strip! Food can be dull or delicious but service is key in my book. I will be back!   Food: wings were decent size (can't beat traditional wing Tuesday) but its all in the flavor   Service: if its slow don't doubt. Hopefully Martika serves you!  Cleanliness: tables were clean, floor had no trash, bathrooms were cleaned and stocked.   A+++ I love Vegas Buffalo Wild Wings!"}
{"text":"This review is from a vegetarian and that in itself is big! There are plenty of delicious options here, including salads, nachos, and a multitude of sizzling appetizers, drinks, and desserts. I would highly recommend the cheese curds with a sauce of your choice. They are addicting and are an instant burst of flavor in your mouth, a perfect alternative to the wings everyone raves about, so you're not missing out!   This particular location is popular for students and on game day. A perfect place to hangout, satisfy those hunger pangs, and enjoy a good ambiance. And not to mention, the waiters are super friendly!"}
{"text":"I like Buffalo Wild Wings, but this one in particular I despise. I walk in, full staff of employees just standing there looking at me....a good 2-3 mins..not busy at all...... Okay? Lol I had to make myself look dumb so that they can finally help me. They finally decided to work and attend me and my family. Sit at booth and from my peripheral vision I notice something poking in and out of the wall next to my foot.... no lie, a damn rodent!!! Are you serious??? Hell no! Such a bad experience! Never again!"}
{"text":"Went to this place last night. Service was bad even though no one was even there just about 6 tables. I got boneless wings medium hot. Me and my friend waited for the meal for about 20 25 minutes. I took a bite and told my self no more. Way to to hot. I went in side telling them it's way to hot can I change my? They said yes the server will be right with you. The girl that served us took forever to come to my table to take my order again. Finally she came and said I'm so sorry I can change your order. She took my order and said it'll take 6 minutes. 6 minutes turned in to 15 or so minutes (I didn't look at the time) she finally came with my order, I then got bbq boneless. The sauce was right but tasted like it was kinda old. Over all this place is probably good but the waitress wasn't that good."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Typical sports bar, lots of screens and noise.   But the wings are terrific.... dozens of sauces and dry rubs for selections, and prepared perfectly.  Other foods are typical bar fare,but prepared well and enjoyable Service is speedy and attentive.  Tuesdays are sale night for wings.... a real bargain."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile, forgot how good the fried pickles were! Bernadette did a great job tonight being or server/waitress even though she's really new she did great!"}
{"text":"We were able to order our takeout online which was super convenient especially picking out the sauces. The wings were amazing and more meaty than I remember. Thanks for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"I love the buffalo chips and cheese. Make sure you get them extra crispy. Its always fun and the service is good if you get the right person. The bar isn't to packed during the week. Also, they have a new flat bread pizza Spinach and Chicken SOOOO good."}
{"text":"I come to this location multiple times a month for their lunch specials.  $6.99 if I remember correctly for boneless wings (or traditional), fries, celery, and ranch.  You can substitute the fries for chips, side salad, etc. for a bit more.  I am never bloated when leaving there nor have an empty stomach.  I've been there for a few coworker parties for various reasons and everyone keeps up nicely.  The alcohol is a bit pricey but it's not so bad for a casual drink.  Go to a corner bar or two bucks if you're trying to get loaded.  The waitresses there I would say bust their ass for the most part.  They're normally decently busy around lunchtime and I've seen them under extremely heavy load during March Madness.  They keep up well.  I come in there so often that one of the waitresses recognized my coworker and told her that she left her credit card there.  She thought she lost it somehow so that's pretty cool that she was proactive about that in a service business.  Also, I've seen some chick with a broken leg cleaning tables, sweeping, and waiting on tables without a hiccup in her productivity.  All waitresses I'd say do a good job, even the new ones coming in that I haven't seen before.  There are some minor mistakes here and there like forgetting ranch dressing or celery once in a blue moon but everyone is human.  P.S.  Don't forget to sign up to their email if you want $5 off.  I simply told them about the code on my phone's email and they took it right off the receipt without even punching in the code.  I didn't abuse that obviously but shows they're pretty cool and laid back staff."}
{"text":"Okay, so I normally don't do chains (as in, I normally don't go to them and when I do I generally don't Yelp them) but I'm a regular here late at night. It's one of the few places near my work that is open when I get off, so I'm here often.  The food is standard B-Dubs, so I won't really cover that. You know the deal. There's a good tap selection, too. Both mega-brewery swill and more local stuff like New Glarus or Wisconsin Brewing Co. Score!  There's a handful of servers here who are super cool and don't even seem like they hate their lives, despite working the slow-as-hell night shift. Service is always fast when I'm here late at night and I've never had problems on that front.  When my work had a small get-together here recently to celebrate somebody who is leaving us, they were pretty accommodating, so that's neat."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite bar In Vegas. Best service and the bar is better than any man cave I could make. I go here even when I don't want wings because the bartenders are the best in Vegas"}
{"text":"Have never had a bad experience at a B Dubs and this place was no different. Always freindly staff at all BWW's."}
{"text":"This was a great experience at this location. I had a good waiter and the wings were great. I tried the habanero wings for the first time, I think they are the best choice if you like something spicy. I liked the size of the location and the many televisions had several different choices of sports to watch. The happy hour is pretty good too, had some of the chicken tacos and they were perfect to cool down my mouth from the habanero wings. I will be returning to this location in the future."}
{"text":"Did not like this location at all. When I got there they were not very busy but every table in the bar are was dirty. It took the waiter a while just to wipe it down. While the service was poor the food was still good. We ordered the wild and the hot wings, they were great. I also had the bacon burger with fries, I loved the crunchy fries I received and the burger was very good. This is one of the smallest BWW I have ever been to and did not enjoy my service, I would not return to this location based on the service but the food was good."}
{"text":"Second visit to this location and both times to watch football.  As before food was good and so was the service.  We come for the games and enjoy wings, salad and beer. It's a wing joint and a place to watch sports."}
{"text":"Currently at location...eating dry chicken wings ...nachos with hardly any cold cheese, drinks are watered down- waitress left us unattended, overseasoned and overcooked wedges..definetely not what you'd want a date night!! Either cook at home or take your date elsewhere! Totally ruined the night...."}
{"text":"I'm 99% sure my waiter stole my card information and had a shopping spree at fry's. Anyways the food was good but the waiter was weird"}
{"text":"Food is great and service is decent. My one and only complaint is the restaurants cleanliness. The bathrooms, are awful. It's not just once every so often, but literally every time I go to this location. The tables are poorly wiped down and are usually still soaking wet. I understand this is a bar, but damn. Get it together guys. Makes you really wonder what the kitchen looks like..."}
{"text":"I went in here with a friend on Saturday night- should've read the reviews on here first!   We were in the beachwood area, and figured a big sports bar and restaurant would be the right place to go to watch an out-of-town hockey game. How foolish of us. Despite the fact that this place must have 30+ TV's, with 5 or more playing the same NCAA football game, and a few playing another out of town hockey game, the staff REFUSED to tune one of the TVs to the game we wanted to watch.   We clearly said- \"if you can put the game on, we'll stay. Otherwise, we're leaving.\" They wouldnt put the game on, so we left.   Luckily another bar in the area was more accommodating and we got to see the game."}
{"text":"Sit and sit for 15 minutes just to be greeted by our waitress. We had to flag the hostess down to grab our waitress. Waitress comes over to take our order. No apology or anything.  We ordered drinks, appetizers and food all in one and the fact that your servers can't function in a basic function is pathetic.  Expensive, mediocre food with trash service."}
{"text":"If I could give this review 0 stars, I would. I love Buffalo Wild Wings, I really do, it has been my go to restaurant EVERY SINGLE TUESDAY for the past 5 years. I always go to the one on the North side of town, but this time, my boyfriend and I decided to go to this one-- bad move. A week prior to today's visit, my boyfriend ordered take out, when he picked it up, they didn't verify the order with him, but he assumed everything was okay, so once he arrived home with it, the order was completely wrong. He had ordered 10 wings, but they gave him 5 and STILL charged him for the \"10\" wings. We got a basket of fries, they gave us a regular sized one and again, charged him for a basket. Not only that, when we picked up the boxes the bottoms of the boxes were WET, I have absolutely no idea what it was, but really...? I called to complain and the girl on the phone said, \"No, impossible, the boxes couldn't have been wet.\" So she assumed I was lying. I asked to speak to a manager, and he gave us $30 food credit. Today's visit was decent up until I brought up the credit to the server. Before she brought us our bill, I said \"excuse me, I believe we have store credit for our food here.\" And responded with a bad attitude saying \"What do you mean store credit?\" And I said \"We have credit here due to our poor visit last time, our food was supposed to be paid for.\" Again, with her horrible attitude she said, \"Yeah, well we don't do that here.\" At this point I was enraged. I laughed and said \"Are you serious?\" She laughed back at me and said \"Yeah, you have to pay for your own food.\" She realized I was angry, and then walked away to talk to her manager. When she came back, she said \"You guys are all taken care of, have a good one\", and I said \"Why did you tell us that we didn't have credit though?\" And she said \"I didn't know that we did that\"- I scoffed and then she did too, rolled her eyes and walked away. I didn't leave a tip or thank her because she didn't deserve it. I still have credit there, but I would rather starve than eat there. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"love the wings! garlic parmsean!  also love the appetizer plate.. and playing video poker while drinking  linen kuegals.    the service is always friendly and it's a clean establishment.. but not very big for patrons who do not want to sit at the bar... the location on las vegas blvd is actually a little bigger.. not much.. but bigger.  it's in an out of the way location, so seating is pretty easy..."}
{"text":"Husband's work Fantasy Football Draft was held here.. Great service. . Great food.   No rush to finish!  Great time!"}
{"text":"I'd give no stars if permitted. I may attend other Buffalo Wild Wings but not this location in Goodyear. This isn't the first time I've had bad service at this location, but it was the worst customer service experience I've ever had. In  speaking to others they have also shared their experiences with poor customer service at this location.  I live in Goodyear so it's unfortunate. I had a waitress who first thought it excusable to not wait my table for more than 20 minutes after being seated, then she tried lie by saying she wasn't our waitress, to make maters worse she claimed my husband was cursing at her(which he never even gave a tone like he was using foul language) and the worst part is she continued to harass us by returning to our table after I had requested the manager. I finally decided to walk to the counter to ask for the manager myself she followed me continuing to harass me. The manager wasn't much better.  His Initial response was his response to my email and his response was very nice but I felt he was more concerned with making excuses for his employee. He was checking with the host to see if maybe tables were switched on her or something that could have thrown her off. I don't think that should matter, regardless of the reason, there should be no excuse for that type of behavior. He did apologized and asked if there was anything he could do for us. I was not looking for handouts,  but in my past experience with poor service, the management has never asked me if there is anything they could do for me. Instead they took the initiative to try and make things right. Then I received an email response which stated \"We strive very hard to make orders correct the first time, but we are only human and we sometimes make mistakes.\" This was spilled water, that would be a mistake. This was behavior issues. There is so much more I could say but I won't. I will just never return to this restaurant and will tell everyone I know about this experience.   Sent from my iPhone"}
{"text":"If you like slow service, cold food, and a rude wait staff than this is the place for you!  If you are like me, than you expect the employees to speak with you occasionally, and not each other constantly. The employees were standing hanging out in groups all over this store. Lines of people waiting to be seated, lines near the pick up booth, and everywhere I looked employees were just milling around.  Not what I want to see when orders are late, the restaurant is busy and there is work to do.   I would advise you to stay away, unless they fire and rehire the entire staff, or you have lots of time to waste, a high tolerance of poor service and order mistakes."}
{"text":"Remind me not to go here ever again, over sauced, over cooked wings with below average service."}
{"text":"Horrible wings, poor service. Wings were severely undercooked and manager could care less. This location needs to get it together"}
{"text":"Service at the bar was SOO slow.  Then waiting for the check was even worse.  Food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Really great place to eat and drink. we have been in 4-5 times since they have opened.  Service was a little spotty the first time we were in but it has improved every time we go back."}
{"text":"Good service.. good food.  Will go back to this location.   Have been to others in Vegas not so good.   Next to Galleria Mall.  Easy & convenient to get to"}
{"text":"We had extremely fast service at lung. The wings were tasty. Playing interactive games on the tablet was great as well. Will try and get back for a hockey  game one night."}
{"text":"7/21/12 My wife and I stopped in primarily because it was pouring and we didn't want to run to the car from the mall.  The beer selection is nothing special (i.e. Coors Light, Michelob Ultra, Bud Light...).  The wings are okay.  The bartenders are sometimes chilly and salty.  More than once we've said this is the last time. We like to play trivia and catch the occasional game there."}
{"text":"I would've given this place 3 stars but my server really was great! My frustration has to be the parking. Like really does Uhaul need the entire front and back parking spaces? I'm not even exaggerating, they had so many of their trucks parked everywhere almost made us miss out happy hour because we waited 20 min until we found parking. ( Happy hour is from 2-7pm)  After waiting a long time to park, we decided to go straight to the back of the bar and sit and order. Our server was fast! Attentive and even did a busted with a joke, made my frustration go away. Wings are obviously bomb, but expect to wait. This place is a hot spot to watch games and honestly why I keep coming back is because idk the people here are happy drunks lol. I guess we have to give to to the waiters to make sure we're relaxed and happy. ( My server was Trey! Thank you T )"}
{"text":"I generally don't like food, but every Thursday for a year now I come here and get the boneless wings. I used to get a burger until I lost a bet and a coworker made me get wings. I've never gone back. In fact, I anxiously look forward to our weekly visit to b-dubs. The wings are so yum."}
{"text":"Food was typical food for a chain place, wasn't bad.  The service was awful.  I seriously debated not leaving a tip.  We had to track our waitress down twice.  We were there watching the game with a group and she maybe came by every 20-25 minutes."}
{"text":"We went with 15 people and they had issues with seating us all together. When they finally fixed the seating the manager Scott ( Orange shirt ) came and said that they couldn't have all the tables like that due to it being dinner time and the Basketball games were starting. So we managed with the tables we had. Prior to this table issue the server took the drinks and appetizer order only to find out after we got the seating issue resolved that they hadn't even been but it so we cancelled our appetizer orders and this time someone from the table addressed the Manager Scott and kindly explained that we wouldn't be ordering anything but our meal and that's sad cause at this table we had good drinkers and eaters. So I went to order a MGD 64 only to be told they don't serve Miller products when clearly it's on the menu and I've had it at another location in July of 2014 which was a horrible place also. So after waiting 45 minutes while other guest that were seated after us got there food and half of the party at the other table got there food we finally received our and my son had water poured on him and ranch dumped in his lap during the serving of his food. And we asked for Mayo on a sandwhich which they failed to do only to get 10 packets of it on the side, Today was my daughters birthday and she wanted to go there oh and BTW she was pregant and was at the table with our grand daughter who's food wasn't there. When the manager finally came to the table after we received our meal only to say he'd talk to the server who was new and not knowledgeable with  the menu when they should of had 2 people with a party that large. So we got 40 wings coupon for our next visit which was a slap in the face for what we went thru. After it took the server 10 minutes to adjust a check cause there was a drink on it that we didn't order. This was a horrible experience and I will never go back to any of there business ever!! I think undercover boss needs to see what happens in the stores and how the assistant manager's handle things Oh BTW he hide the whole time we were there couldn't find him until he was clearing a table before we left. I've worked in the customer service restaurant field for 28yrs and NEVER would I have treated any guest in my establishment this way and If my managers did this they would be FIRED!!!!  This place is horrible!!! UNACCEPTABLE!!!!"}
{"text":"It took them 15 minutes to sit 4 with literally empty tables everywhere. Then once we were seated it took another 10 minutes for our waitress to come take our drink order, by this time we were ready to order and she wouldn't take our order, like seriously?! What waiter doesn't take our order?! And they are out of a ton of things so it is a very limited menu. And then when we were ordering the waitress didn't know any of the items and the items they were out of they wouldn't substitute. They should've have been shut down because they are out of over ten sauces, and then they are out of bread and buns. So no sauces for wings and no buns for burgers or sandwiches. Get it together Buffalo Wild Wings because this is a joke of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Meh typic Wild wings tho nothing majorly good to point out. They have sports and cold beer so can't complain too much"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often since it is only a couple miles from my place. Although; a couple of friends and I came in on a busy UFC without us knowing, it didn't take too long to get seated. our waitress was Alexis, who is a super sweet girl that provided excellent service! I ordered a small serving of wings. one of the wings was so burnt, it was black. yuck! the rest of the wings were okay, but every time I come in, I notice that they definitely slack sauce. will be back just because it is the closest BWW to my house, and I usually don't feel like driving all the way to Westgate!"}
{"text":"Waited in the bar area for a good 5 mins waiting for our server (was using the restroom) and not one person came up to give me a menu or to let me know my server would be coming shortly. The manager was sitting with two servers at a table by the bar and kitchen door. As a former buffalo employee, I know we had to greet our table within a minute so why the manager didn't even think to come by was baffling. Although I didn't work at this location, I see the management is just as bad as my former location. Thank god Christian is an awesome server and saved the day. He is the only reason I come to this location."}
{"text":"This is a great place for wings and beer right across from campus. The service is great and the vibe very cool. New menu rolled out just in time for college football season. Jamie is manager is fantastic. She always makes it a point yo stop by and make sure all is good ...."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and efficient. The wings were very flavorful - great Parmesan garlic and Thai curry flavors. The fried pickle chips are also very good! Great for an afternoon with baseball, hockey, and golf on television."}
{"text":"Don't go here b/c I called in my order and I get here and the woman asked me if I ordered from there and I say yes and they claimed it wasn't there. I used to be a loyal customer but I won't come here anymore."}
{"text":"I came here with some of my family.. it was just horrific service. Order a buffalo chicken sandwich and they bring me a wrap.. ordered a bacon cheese burger and they smothered it in barbecue sauce. We waited 15 minutes for a table and no that is not that bad but the wait for the food and then waiting even more because they got the incorrect order made it a longer wait then it needed to be. A whole lot of servers running around and then none to be found. We don't even know where our original server went. We ended up finally getting service from 2 different servers 10 minutes later. This is my  first complaint I have ever written. I use to work in the food industry a long time ago and this is just unacceptable. Definately going to look for a different location next time."}
{"text":"Met my family there tonight - great casual place - I'm not a big fan of chicken wings - so when I join my family there, I'm a little limited on menu choices. I thought this place was a little pricey for the portions you get."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for dinner on Friday night before a movie. The hostess saw us to a table and watched me clean off the dirty seat with my hands while saying \"sorry.\" Not even offering to wipe down the table/chair. Our waitress was horrible. I asked for our check and 12 minutes later she comes by and says, \"do you need anything?\" when we were clearly finished with our meals 15 minutes prior. I repeated to her that I would like our check and she shown no sense of urgency. Meandered to other tables before giving us our check that I had asked for twice in a span of 20 minutes.   Our food was hot and I was grateful for that, but we will not be returning due to the poor quality of staff."}
{"text":"Have eaten here numerous times for takeout since I work nights and get off really late.  I appreciate that they are open 24 hours and the online ordering is really convenient.   The food is always good and fresh for the most part. I have had some order oddities like ice cold queso and an order of wings that was all drums and no flats, but nothing that is too problematic. The potato wedges are consistently crispy and delicious (my favorite treat offered by this chain).  My only issue is the customer service for takeout. Every time I order takeout, I end up having to wait at least 10-15 minutes after the scheduled pickup time. I'm not really sure why that is. I think they need to prioritize their takeout orders a little better is all.   They offer a military discount, which is nice, and one of the times I had to wait, the lady was apologetic and offered me a free drink in an effort to compensate.   I think this place would be better for dining in, but seeing as the takeout is all I have to go on, 3 stars."}
{"text":"Love this buffalo I visit a few times a month. The food is always good, it's clean, and the waitress are nice. The wait time isn't too bad most days. I've ordered to go as well and the wings are amazing."}
{"text":"We came in to pick up an order for wings on Boneless Thursday (a great deal).  We were greeted by the manager, who took our order and made small talk with us.  He even gave us an extra coupon for 6 free wings because my friend and I were joking with him while we waited for our food.  Fast service, great wings, LOVE the specials!"}
{"text":"I'm another fan of this chain. It is what it is. If you're looking for fine dining, you're in the wrong place. If you're looking for decent wings (boneless and regular) with a good selection of sauces and rubs, you've come to the right place.  Lots of TVs for sports or trivia!"}
{"text":"Food was decent.  Had to send back salad because we asked for no pico.  Salad came back with less lettuce and little bits of pico still in it.  I guess they thought we wouldn't notice .  What's sad is what if we were allergic?  Willing to put people's lives at risk??"}
{"text":"It is so loud I can't hear my family that is talking at my table. I like music.... But when you can't have conversation at dinner it's too loud!"}
{"text":"Living in Scottsdale by 101 gives a gal limited late night options.  I never thought I could say this about a chain, but this has become one of my favorite late night spots.  The food is always good, fresh, hot, and consistent.  They have a great beer selection with really good prices, and a great full bar with knowledgeable bartenders. Almost every night of the week they have a deal of some kind going on, making a great bang for the buck.  Its never super full which is a plus for me, except for UFC nights, when i just stay the heck away...oooohhhh affliction.   The food has its pluses and its minuses, though.  You cant beat their sauce selection - bests would be the Asian zing, mango habenero (both are hot!) , and spicy garlic.  You can try whichever sauce you want, can modify everything, and change things up with sauces IE 10 wings but 3 with this, 2 with that, and 5 with whatever, and they never complain or question. Everything is made fresh and has always come out hot, and the portions are good sized. My favorite dishes would be the buffalo chicken wrap, their chicken sliders, and of course, the wings.    But the good comes with the bad, and the bad in this case would be the sizes of the wings, both boneless and not.  They are simply not that impressive, so you definitely have to order more to fill up. Also, the boneless have just a bit too much fried breading on the outside and are more nibblet size rather than tenders.    This doesn't keep me from coming back though, especially being addicted to their late night trivia game - which to note, can become a really fun drinking game with your buddies.  I have to give it up to the waiters and bartenders that work here and make this place as great as it is, who are all friendly, down to earth and personal as hell.  Love ya Erin and Chad!"}
{"text":"I've got a great joke for y'all. So two asian chicks, a black dude, a Mexican dude, and a baby walked into a bar. And they were served by this terrible waitress named Mayia who forgot about everything they asked for from the moment they sat down. Forgot beer, straws, lemons, sauces, and napkins all on separate occasions. They had to ask other waiters and steal stuff from unused tables around them on this not so busy night. Could y'all train Mayia cause I've never had any service this bad. Never coming here again. She remembered the people who came in after us's stuff. Please give her a brain as well, cause she kept asking if everything was all good even when we didn't even have anything in front of us to be good with."}
{"text":"The slowest service ever. Sat in the bar area to avoid being forgotten about since bww is known for having crap service in the regular seating area. We waited 25 mins for our food and 45 for our check until we just went up to the bartender to give us our check. We could have easily just dine and dashed since they forgot about us but the manager was sitting right across from us, who btw was just cursing and not giving a crap about any of the other staff asking her for help since she seemed to be on break. Terrible service and the foods not even good."}
{"text":"I gave an extra star because the service was fantastic.  Never had an empty drink, appetizers came up quick, server checked in multiple times.  And this was during busy hours.  The appetizers...not so great imo.  Had the Roasted Garlic Mushroom, just tasted like something fried in my mouth, not sure what it was.  Jalapeno Pepper bites (with bacon), not good, big disappointment.  Artichoke dip - that was good.  The wings...those were pretty good.  I was with friends that had specific tastes and sensitive to heat so since we were sharing I couldn't try the ones I really wanted to (habanero, blazing, etc.)  Did try the hot, parmesan garlic, honey bbq, and they were all good.  Liked the sports bar atmosphere, different games all over and you can play trivia.   All in all, I'd definitely go back for the wings and the artichoke dip."}
{"text":"BWW has became my go to spot for wings always pretty good! Always really good and the wings are big too! The Asian zing has easily became my favorite flavor dellllllllicious!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The bartender was very friendly, the food was good and they put whatever game I wanted on the tube. I was actually craving a Heineken and guess what - it was on special for the month. Food is often hit and miss here, unless you get boneless wings, but on this night the Buffalitos were solid, teeming with white chunks of chicken and other taco condiments. Also enjoyed the  chips and salsa on the side. This is a college area BWW, but it wasn't overly packed liked the Mill Avenue bars (Lodge) on a Saturday night around 8pm."}
{"text":"The food is scrumtrelesant. I challenge any mortal man who dear say otherwise. The honey bbq boneless wing are God incarnate"}
{"text":"love their thursday wings special but they could definitely have a wider selection of flavours. i've tried them all and now it's getting boring"}
{"text":"Went here again because I had a gift certificate. Had the asian wings and honey bbq, it was a whole lot better this time. If your up to it they have trivia on mondays I will be there and I'm reining champion."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!  Good food and like the vibe.  It's the same as every other BWW i have been to."}
{"text":"We recently threw my brother a surprise 30th birthday party here and it could not have been more perfect! The staff was amazing, including the GM, Andrew P, and the servers for our party, Samantha and Colton! Andrew was very helpful with getting the details set up prior to the big day and checked in multiple times via phone to make sure we had everything we needed. Sam and Colton were amazing day of and made sure we constantly had everything we needed. BW3 even let us bring in decorations to celebrate the day! I would definitely recommend this BW3 to all friends/family in the area!"}
{"text":"Your typical BWW that you would get anywhere else.  The only downside to this place is eating in the dining room.  Servers are on point but for some reason the food hits the seating area slower than the bar area.  And if your order was the first to go in, be prepared for room temperature wings.  The bar is great with awesome bartenders and cheap drinks.  All in all, a fun place to watch some games and have some wings."}
{"text":"Pretty crowded around dinner time but we were seated very quickly. They forgot about us for about 10 minutes but they made up for it with excellent service! The food was fantastic as well, wings were cooked to perfection. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Such an awful place. How can they clean and make you feel uncomfortable when people go to eat and relax. Very unprofessional!! Their wings smelled bad too. Unfortunately I'm done going here."}
{"text":"We LOVE Buffalo Wild Wings! We came here on the way back to California on Sunday... Well the service was absolutely horrible! I understand that it was super bowl Sunday, but we went in at about 11am and it wasn't busy at all! Our food took forever! And our appetizer came out with our meals, which is annoying and the waiter didn't even say anything about it. After he dropped off our food he never came back to check on us at all! We waved him down to ask for more ranch and he told us it's .60 cents extra each one, fine whatever not a big deal, I've never been charged for extra ranch before, we usually get the large traditional and it usually comes with 4 ranch, this time only 2. After that he then again NEVER check on us! Not for refills or anything! He walked right past our table several times. We even had to ask someone else to bring us the bill because we were waiting for him for so long.   We are nice customers, were never rude we always say please and thank you, and it takes a lot for my husband and I to even complain to anyone about the service we receive. But this was ridiculous! Next time Were in Vegas we will avoid this place forsure."}
{"text":"There were so many TVs, I couldn't decide what to watch, I settled on the one in front of me. There were so many beers on tap, I couldn't decide what to drink, so I just decided to hydrate with some water. There were so many delicious wing sauce flavors, I had to narrow it down to two. I went with the Spicy BBQ and the Mango Habanero. I like spicy, but not too spicy - these were perfect. The word \"habanero\" scared me a little, but the server can bring out a sample of all of the sauces so that you know what you are getting in to. I also tried my cousin's Spicy Garlic, and they were really good too! The House Salad was ok, nothing exciting, but it was a pretty good size. The dressing came in little packets, which I thought was a little strange. Either way, I'll go back for more wings!"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about at good ole BWW. This new location has a different layout with a wrap around bar which looks like a kitchen top counter. The bartenders on this weeknight were not very busy, so we got to chat and Jenn was very talkative and nice. They had $3.75 Coors biggies and soon enough 10pm reverse happy hour rolled around and they had $3.00 Bud Light biggies. I just wish they had a better happy hour menu or more choices or discounts on real food. I did try the chicken wrap, grilled, but should have had the pieces tossed in sauce, instead of spices, which I could not taste. Jenn did get me more spices though and the wrap with chips/salsa as a side hit the spot, but was just middle of the road in the wrap world. Huge big screen TV dead center too, so this place should do fine as usual. Better to go when less folks are there in my opinion."}
{"text":"We went there last night.  I brought a large group of co-workers because Friday night I was there with my family and quite frankly I've never had better service in my life.  Our server, Ryan, was the best--he had my children giggling the whole time and everything was fantastic.  Last night I had a large table of co-workers--we lucked out and got Ryan again, he was fast, courteous and had excellent knowledge of the menu--very helpful suggesting items for my indecisive friend.  The food was great but I'm only giving two stars because our drinks were a long wait--all night---we were watching baseball and I would understand if we were ordering fancy complicated mixed drinks---or if he looked busy--or was new--but no--this bartender was simply SLOW and non responsive to our server--and our order was simply beer! Lots of beer! My boss under tipped because he was so irritated by the glacier pace--which was so unfair to Ryan--I think I will let management know.....something so basic can turn a five star experience into a two star experience instantly :("}
{"text":"Went to order some wings for dinner, the young girl that took my order repeated my order twice and also got my order wrong twice.   I asked for 36 wings (12,12 & 12 of different sauces) and she even advised me to get 25 & 10 would be less expensive. But I. My bag only put 24 wings. Then she didn't put the salads I ordered into the bag.   I understand if they were busy to maybe make one mistake,but they weren't busy.   I want to give them a good review since I've been to other Buffalo Wild Wings and they went above and beyond.   This Buffalo Wild Wings needs to work on its customer service skills and there needs to be someone to double check the orders.   Not returning any time soon."}
{"text":"BWSquared is a run-of-the-mill wing chain.  The food isn't out of this world, but it is good enough to garner return trips.  Where it truly stands out from other American-Grille type establishments is in the customer experience.  For a sports-bar-restaurant focused venue it is still pretty family and non-sports-fan friendly.  And the food selection is wide enough to satisfy most palates.  I always enjoy going in with friends and playing trivia.  Unlike some other establishments where the standardized trivia games are played, BWSquared always has the player consoles ready to go, which makes the whole thing possible.  You can compete with other restaurant patrons as well as with the nation wide network, last time we were in the Top 500 for the US, sounds cooler than it really is.  If you like some spiciness, try out the Spicy Garlic ... enough of a kick to get those taste buds fired up but not enough to need a pitcher of water or sign a waiver."}
{"text":"I don't know why there are so many bad reviews on here!! I always order carry out (vs the 2 times my boyfriend came and sat down) and it's always been good. Service can be slow at times but they are busy so it's understandable! Niko and Austin at the carry-out counter are awesome, I see then every time I pick up. They always are recommending new sauces for me to try and always make sure my order is right. Great job guys!! Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location off and on for about 2 years now and I must say for the last 12 months they have fallen off. I went there Friday 9/23/16 around 2 pm. The service was cool and the food was just ok. I ordered a chicken sandwich from the menu with onion rings. There weren't a lot of ppl in there so u expect everything to be on point. My sandwich comes with cheese according to the menu so when it comes out I notice, no cheese. So she asks me do u want me to go get it? I said no take the whole thing, so when she comes back they just laid the cheese on top of the chicken and whatever else was on top of it and didn't even melt the cheese. I took a pic of it and I will attach it. I mean damn I'm not picky but couldn't u at least melt the cheese before it came back to me, looking like a board on top of my sandwich and the chicken wasn't even a good size. This is the only item that I get when I go to BWW and when I first started getting the sandwich the chicken was huge. Now it's like they don't give a damn anymore.  Customers do pay attention to small things BWW."}
{"text":"Overpriced and subpar food compared to other B-Dubs locations. In fact, all 3 locations owned by this group are poorly run. The wings are NEVER crispy unless you order them that way and even then sometimes they aren't. There is always way too much sauce or barely any sauce on them. I mean they are wings...cook 'em long enough and toss 'em in a bowl of sauce. Not hard. The service is usually good however when we walked in this time the hostess was put off by our request for a table. She explained that WE came in at a terrible time (4:30) bc it was shift change and there was only one server who was yelling at her for seating people. ARE YOU SERIOUS? She also told us it might take a while to get service bc of this. Had we not had a 10 month old in tow we definitely would have walked out. Seems like the front and back of the house need to be retrained in hospitality and food prep. Never again Strongsville B-Dubs...never again."}
{"text":"Average B-dubs but better than most around NEO. Stopped in tonight before the Lutheran West FB game and everything was good. The orders for our party of 8 came out hot, reasonably fast, and most importantly...correct. The service was also really good for being as busy as they were. I still think b-dubs is overpriced though. We really only come here bc it's convenient before football games."}
{"text":"Went to watch NHL playoffs and on 80% of their TVs was baseball. I asked to have them switch to MN Wild game and he said all TVs were requested. I walked around bar not one person was watching Seattle Mariners game."}
{"text":"Ugh. I keep on thinking that some day this place will be decent. But alas, it never is. And this seems to be an even lower end location than other BW3 locations. The wings are just flat out disgusting to me. They are small, undercooked, have lots of dark meat and red lines, and are majorly under-sauced (even when requesting them \"wet\"). And while they offer numerous sauces of varying heats, none of particularly tasty or hot. The only things I can tolerate here are the appetizers. They are edible, but far from tasty or desirable. The staff are alright. But they always seem to prefer socializing with other staff and friends that come in than actually doing their jobs. Napkins and silverware are never provided unless very specifically requested at least 3x. The beer offerings are alright. Not great, but better than like PT's. All in all, skip it."}
{"text":"I have been to this location (and this chain)  2 times in the last 2 weeks and I really enjoy the atmosphere and food. I ordered wings both times (of course)  and tried a wide range of their flavors. My favorite was the jammin' jalapeño. Also, I have tried the \"hottest\"  sauce on the menu but in my opinion the mango habenero is the hottest flavor.   Tuesdays is 60c wings night. The restaurant really pushes for takeout so it's worth giving this place a shot if you do not feel like dining in. The service was reasonably fast and overall I enjoyed both my visits here.   Overall, I would recommend this location and chain to a friend."}
{"text":"Actually 2.5 stars.  I don't like to put too much effort into these fast food restaurant chains. So I'll get right to the point.   This is not my favorite location. Why? Because the service was a slow. The wings were still tasty."}
{"text":"They're open late, we went after midnight and the atmosphere was kind of standoffish. It looked like a nice, clean restaurant and bar area. The bar was still open but the dining area was closed already. The bartender was our server, and he was not very friendly and inviting. He wasn't observant about refilling our drinks either throughout our visit. The hot wings were super hot, especially the boneless wings for some reason. The french fries were perfect! I loved them! They were the perfect amount of crispy and hot! The long island iced teas were not very strong at all, so it seemed like they didn't use much alcohol at all. The meal and the drinks were kind of pricey since the alcoholic drinks were $10 a drink. I would return to give them another chance, but I would make sure to order mild wings instead of hot. I would order a different drink as well."}
{"text":"Great service,  food is always reliably good and you can't beat trivia!"}
{"text":"Service has clearly improved. Still loud and many projectors now are showing color problems. But food is more consistent and staff are better then before."}
{"text":"I have been to this BW3 a few times and I confess - I like it. I don't understand the appeal of wings, but now that I know they have boneless wings, I'll be back more often! I tried the honey bbq which had a little bit of spice to it, but was really good (I don't tend to like real spicy foods). Would like to try another sauce next time.  Fun atmosphere, wait staff has always been attentative and offered refills which keeps me happy!, and the food is good.  Recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing honey BBQ sauce.  Wings wet and crispy.  Great atmosphere.  I can't imagine going anywhere else for wings."}
{"text":"I had been craving BWW since I moved from Vegas.  I know some people prefer a more traditional wing with wing sauce, but I have become addicted to their honey BBQ sauce great blend of taste with a slight kick.  With football playoffs going on I decided it was time to drive and seek one in town out.  This location is located in a nice outdoor mall and looks very nice.  Inside it was sleek looking and the bar was ready to serve.  I ordered 12 Boneless extra wet extra crispy with an order of wedges.  The wings came out incredibly wet probably the most sauce I've ever gotten on wings which I loved.  The bartender mistakenly gave me chips instead of wedges but luckily the chips were tasty.    The service was overall friendly and both bartenders were on top of the bar patrons.  I will say the staff interact in a very fun and loud way at times which could put some people off but if you ever have seen a commercial for this place it matches the fun sports bar vibe.  They lose one star because I ordered cheese on my wedges/chips and historically this was always shredded melty wonderfulness, and instead I received nacho seemingly out of the jar salsa cheese.  Not what I was looking for and not necessarily a fan of.  Also as much as I love the wings the price in comparison to a lot of strictly wing joints is a bit steep for a wing.  All in all a great experience and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Don't plan to go spend your money at this location if you have kids. We went in and was told there were no tables available however there were at 6 open tables. When we asked why we could not have those seats we were told that they needed to give every server a table first. Not sure what that meant.  We finally got seated outside. We had the poorest service ever. No refills we had to drink our melted ice. No sauce brought out. One of the people in our party didn't get their food until everyone else was done. We requested to talk to the manager when he came he proceeded to argue with us as customers. He disagreed with us several times. I am not sure when arguing with the customer was except able."}
{"text":"This place was fun! It was our first time there, and the food was pretty good! The prices are a bit high, but I liked it okay. The wings were great, the lemonade was delish, and the cheese sticks we ordered were good but a little cold. You cold tell they were pre made. They have tons of TVs with different sports games playing, and you can play trivia while you wait for your food which I thought was pretty fun. From a girl in a wheelchair's point of view: the hostess was nice but they did what pretty much every restaurant does... They sat me in the middle of the room of tables. It's was hard to squeeze the wheelchair past everyone that was already seated. So it's really inconvenient for me and the people who had to either stand up or scoot in so we could pass. That pretty much happens everywhere though.. So I only knocked off one star. I would definitely go back there to eat though!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place???  We've been here several times in the past year but last night was the worst food ever?  Seems like the cooks in the back truly don't give a crap anymore.  Nachos were garbage?  With bagged chicken added?  Not even fresh??  And just liquid cheese dumped on it and a spoon of chili?  Worse we've ever had.  One order of wings came out in a POOL of hot sauce.  Sauce was just dumped on them and so much in the bottom of the bowl.  It was like wings floating in soup! Another order came out over poured too, but not as bad as the other.  Still - way too much added to the wings.  And then the chipotle bbq rub ones- OMG...they cooked them, threw then in the bowl and poured/dusted a massive coat of the rub on one side of the wings?  Not lightly tossed??  I had to scrape them off.  The service is always great (will give them a 4) and you can always get some beer.  But c'mon guys, the cooks suck!"}
{"text":"If you're from a different area, and you don't get broadcasts of your home football team playing; this is the place for you. They have numerous TVs devoted to each and every game, and seats you based on which team you would like to see.   The food here's also decent, with okish wings and delicious nachos. They also have a decent variety of beer on tap, with pretty cheap prices.   If it's a Sunday and you don't have much to do, drop by and watch your favorite team kick ass."}
{"text":"I've been to a few diff locations and never been impressed. The food has always been just ok, the service mediocre, but the chicken was on point and our server Linnea was amazing. She always had an eye on our table and didn't just walk over to take our order and check on us when the food was out. She came by many times and kept bringing us all of the different sauces and spices we needed. Fun, funny, sweet, and very attentive. They need more of her in all of the restaurants in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go once when I was shopping cross the street. Ordered chicken wings and I mango lemonade. I got there about 15 min after I ordered . As I walked in this place I saw employees are just stand there talking . I told one of the lady I'm coming for pick and she told me to wait because she has to get the cashier !  Got Sprite lemonade instead mango ! This place need to well manage !"}
{"text":"I come to this place at least once a month with my friends ,food is always good and Courtney is a sweet server ! Love their chicken wings !"}
{"text":"50 TV's good food and a fun staff. I found this place by mistake and after a weekend of football I'm sold."}
{"text":"The service here was GREAT. Our server was friendly, fun, and informative. The drinks and food came quickly, and the wings were excellent. Fairly priced for good sized wings with lots of meat on them, and tasty sauce. I tried the spicy garilc, which I really enjoyed, and other at the table liked teryaki, lemon pepper, and 'slammiin' honey garlic'The other food we tried was also good - the garlic chicken flat bread was a garlic lover's dream, and the deep fried pickles were perfect.   There are LOTS of TVs for entertainment, some even have trivia or poker games on them that guests can play - fun!! We will certainly go back here, and imagine it being a good destination during sports events!! A little noisy for sure, but that is expected at a place like this."}
{"text":"Y'all suck fat donkey dick, waited an hour for food, fuck this place, servers are cute but pretty sure they disappoint their husbands when It comes to cooking dinner, except for fat Cindy, she right as fuck."}
{"text":"Went late one night with a friend after work probably around midnight, we sat down, took a bit for someone to come by and take our drink order. Then when we got our drinks dropped off.. not another acknowledgement that we were there was given to us. We waited for a menu and the waiter to come back for like 15 mins before getting up and leaving. Will not return to this location again"}
{"text":"The new \"bdubs\" location is far superior to their previous location on State St. What they lost in a \"homey\" feel, they've gained in a much better sports environment.   I'm about 99% sure that their commercials describing their ability to extend games is false, but 100% sure that it makes no difference.   Bdubs is becoming an American Classic, and this location only helps the national brand."}
{"text":"I like this place ok but their nachos are a disgrace. Chips with some lettuce. Other toppings sparing. I pulled at least 10 chips with little to no toppings. Get wings here. Beer. Not nachos."}
{"text":"Update on my previous review. It's hard for me to knock a rating down, but the service is just...something else. I love me some chicken wings and their potato wedges, but it's not really possible to go in for a quick meal. Maybe that is why their takeout is so popular. I'd still come to Bdubs, but just plan your time accordingly."}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wild Wings.  That being said, today I ordered takeout and it took 27 minutes.  Not very happy"}
{"text":"Rude \"Captain\" !!! She was very irritated that we sat at a table that wasn't cleaned yet. When she did come over, she wiped the table, made a rude comment telling my boyfriend that if he would move his keys, she could clean our table and left us with a wet table. She was miserable. She never returned to see how we were doing. In fact,  she did the opposite. She avoided us the entire time, had a sour look on her face every time she passed our table. I dont know why we ever come here. I'm never impressed. Used up our gift card. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was horrid. For a place that only serves wings you think they would go somewhere that the actually make good wings and get the recipe Not impressed"}
{"text":"Excellent service,  good selection of food and drink,  and more big HD tvs showing sports than I could ever want.  Whenever I see those BWW signs,  i automatically  start smiling"}
{"text":"Ordered the Signature Sampler with mozzarella sticks, fries, ultimate nachos and honey barbecue wings. I loved every bit of it, the Strawberry lemonade was LIFE!!! but I wish it came with free refills since its $3.99 a glass. Overall I will go back again!"}
{"text":"This is my husband and my favorite restaurant, but the last few times we have been here,  the service has been marginal at best and the quality of food has diminished to almost unrecognizable. The management covers for the horrible staff as best she can, but this place has gone downhill so far the past year, I do not believe we will EVER return.   They pour a beer with about a 1 1/2 inch head and overcook their chicken half the time. Sad, but true. Sorry BWW, it's  you,  not us."}
{"text":"So before the improve went here for dinner. Food was ok..ordered wings, garden appetizer, cheese curds, bbq sandwich and flatbread. Obviously the best thing was the wings. Ordered vodka soda..came in a huge glass..ordered another and asked for small glass..she brought it in a shot glass..wth?? Got our bill which included another tables food....didn't notice till after we paid soooo this took forever for them to fix. So Service was just ok..Food ok.."}
{"text":"This weekend we were in Vegas so we hit up Buffalo Wild Wings.  It worked out perfectly because we had planned on taking a trip up to Temecula to taste these highly talked about wings.  Some friends of ours are from the Northeast and say that in college they lived off these suckers.  We went out on Saturday night and so we were killed on Sunday morning.  I didn't feel much like getting off the couch, but we HAD to.  The thought of not going in Vegas and having to drive to Temecula motivated me to go.  When we got there we were sat quickly which was nice considering the state I was in, standing for too long may have caused me to pass out from my headache and weak knees.  I was able to convince my husband to order Medium this time, I was in no condition to deal with the pain from sauce any hotter than that.  Our friend ordered the spicy garlic sauce.  If you haven't been here before, know that there are lots of sauces to choose from for your wings or boneless wings.  I also ordered the fish sandwich and a basket of fries smothered in cheese for the table.    When the wings came out they didn't look as good as all the others we've tried.  The sauce was very orange and the wings were a bit on the small side.  The taste however made up for the appearance...like that saying \"things aren't always as they appear.\"  The wings were yummy, so good in fact that at the moment we thought that they had surpassed the Moondoggies wings in San Diego.  After eating all the wings, the general consensus was that Moondoggies were better but these are a close second.  Their Blue Cheese dressing was good too, but not as good as the Moondoggies dressing.  The fries were awesome though, the best fries we've had during Wing-tober.  The fish sandwich was just ok, there was a lot of fish and it was fried to crisp perfection.  I think I just needed more tartar sauce.  We also got a basket of mini corn dogs \"on the house.\"  Those were just ok also.  They were super crispy on the outside, but you could hardly taste the hot dog inside, needless to say, we didn't finish the basket.    The server was very nice and attentive to us, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Great location,   Took party of 15 and service was great once our tables were all organized and put together.    Great choice of wing flavors, the hotest comes with warning labels!!! FUN!"}
{"text":"Meh. BWW just isn't all that good. And this location seems particularly bad. The service was incredibly slow. We even actually had to go hunt down a server to ask for drink refills and silverware. We ordered a multiple of food to share and we never received any plates or anything.  The wings were really bad quality and too greasy. The ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces were bleh. The salad was alright. The buffalo mac 'n' cheese was just mac 'n' cheese with buffalo tenders on top. The potato chip nachos were meh. It just wasn't good food."}
{"text":"Since management changed, food is never cooked to order. Always very old, cold, or redropped into the fryers and hard. It's too bad, I used to like to eat here. Never again!"}
{"text":"Amazing for BWW!! Great place to watch a game and get a drink! You'll love the way it looks inside and the staff are friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"It's a chain, but eating with my fingers, what's not to like. I'm a wimp in the spicy department so, I don't often eat buffalo hot wings because everyone I'm with orders the \"hot\" ones.  I like the sauce options at Wild Wings and the and the wings are meaty. I had the Parmesan Garlic and the Asian Zing. It's also cool that small portions are available so I was able to order 2 versions. I was able to tolerate the Asian Zing, so maybe I'll try the mild or even medium classic versions next time. My hubby ordered the Jerk Chicken Sandwich and he really liked it. The onion rings were pretty darn good, too.  The only thing negative on this visit was the sucky Berry Lemonade made with Minute Maid Lemonade, I thought for the price it would have been fresh squeezed, but alas I did not read the small type."}
{"text":"I came here in November 2006 for some buffalo wings.  Add that to an intense Ohio State v. Michigan football game and excitement comes to your senses.  A couple of friends and I decided to order 100 buffalo wings with carribean jerk and parmesan garlic sauces, respectively.  Just amazing!  Hooters doesn't even compare!  Eating good food with lots of rowdy football fans was fun too.  Ever since, we've been coming back for the wings.  When you do order the wings though, make sure you don't get the boneless ones.  It just doesn't feel right.  Don't get me wrong, they taste excellent, but boneless wings are not the real deal.  Just to leave you with that thought..."}
{"text":"Great place for the big games, went for march madness. Service was great as usual at the bar. Love the selection of games and brewskis. If you want the sound to a particular game they have no prob switching it or polling the crowd on which game to listen to. I catch this place on tues or thurs when they have wing/boneless specials, wanna say happy hour is 4-7 pm. The wings are usually just a tad too breaded with less meat, this time it was a perfect combo but the last two times they were less saucy than a Mormon Christmas party, other than that a great game/dining experience. Kimberly is the best bartender at a busy bar you could ask for. Only knocking it a tad cause wings are in the name so you should have those down pat. 3 out of 5 this time."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced. Sat for 15 minutes before we were even asked for a drink order. Waited another 13 until HALF our drink order came (water) and took another 10 minutes before our beers and cocktails arrived. Food took forever. And our server was completely rude. He would barely look at me in the eyes while talking, rolled his eyes at me, and he never smiled- we were definitely not welcomed. This was my FIRST time at Bdubs and I'll never return to this location... Maybe never another bdubs location again. THANKS ANTHONY for a horrible Saturday night out with my friends and family."}
{"text":"And this still stands true. My in laws have been going here for years. On football Sunday's and now she has pushed out a weekly 500 dollar tab. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a fan of BWW. But as I was in the area and needed to kill time, I popped into this location. It's very clean and well-kept. The bar area is large and nice. What was a standout here was the bartender. Very friendly and attentive. The prices always seem so absurd to me and not worth it. Thankfully, it was happy hour, so there were a few $4 appetizers available. I opted for the chips and queso (normally over $7). Too bad their wings are always so terrible."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places to go for Beers and Wings. Never have bad service and the right games are always on the tv."}
{"text":"No secret this is my favorite wing place. Best sauces, good variety on tap, and sports to your heart's delight.   Los at the bar has a great attitude and guest relationships. Great place for kids too (not too late though) as they can be louder than at most restaurants and be a little more natural.   If you want good wings, find a B-Dubs"}
{"text":"Terrible service and bad food today Over an hour fir 35 worth of cold food and slow slow service.  Cant get the check, just an overall horrible experience withCanes next doir"}
{"text":"Best wings ever; especially, asian zing, and medium or hot awesome! Next time, Spicy Garlic!  Good food, good service even makes me feel better!  I will definitely go back again.   Food: Good Price: Good Service: Good Parking: Good"}

{"text":"Always my go to spot when I'm in Vegas, wings always extra wet and hot and a nice cold beer!! Service is fast and the fact that it's open 24/7 what else could you ask for! Definitely will be back in June when I go to Vegas again!! I love all BWW but this Vegas location takes the cake! See you soon BDubs."}
{"text":"They waitress asked me what I wanted to drink. I said Diet Coke she replied they no longer serve Coke products. I'll need to think about it then I said after she ran down a list of stuff I didn't want. After reviewing the options for wings in the area I got up and left the only real reason I ever went there is for $.25 wings. Which they stop having long ago. I'll go somewhere where I can get wings and my drink of choice."}
{"text":"Usually great place but wow the service sucks tonight. Over 1.5 hours to order food... 1 drink and waiting"}
{"text":"B-Dubs at Metro Center good. My daughter was hungry for wings. She couldn't decide between boneless barbecue or traditional teriyaki, so we had both.   Tip: Thursdays are 77 cent/boneless wing night.   We capitalized on their Thursday night deal and got 8 boneless bbq. We also got a 7 wing snack order of traditional teriyaki.   I admit that I enjoyed both styles of wings. We enjoyed carrot sticks with ranch.  Our server was a little slow, but overall, we had a pleasant experience. Don't forget to sign up for their rewards program."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Fun place to watch my Cav's and Yankees. Good bar food. Sauces are AWESOME with lots of selections if you like heat. Service is good at the bar. Many good selections of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Love that they have dead guy ale here!"}
{"text":"This is always a great pre game hangout. They provide some gluten free options, which is a must for me. They seem consistent from location to location. It's a bit noisy, so if you're looking for quiet, this is not the greatest choice. They also offer patio dining."}
{"text":"Went to this specific location to watch a world cup game (US vs Portugal).  Though we (group of 7) managed to get a seat inside during the hot summer day - the service wasn't very impressive.  We had to hand-hold and request the server for everything we needed - whether it be a glass of water, utensils, napkins, some form of plate, etc.  Out of frustration, we ended up requesting other servers to help us out but even then the service was close to poor.    Though our meals were done correctly, it took a very long time by the server to actually get the food out to us.  It seemed like server needed to be reminded that we actually ordered food.  Not the greatest experience during game day.  I understand it can get busy and hectic, but that's not an excuse for service to fall behind either.  Overall, an okay experience."}
{"text":"Birthday celebration with hubby and daughter at Wild Wings last night. Our waiter was a little flighty and the mild Buffalo traditional wings were dressed a little too saucy but they were still nice and crispy. I loved my teriyaki traditional wings, but hubby complained that they were under-sauced especially after he requested that they add extra sauce. My daughter loved her boneless teriyaki wings. I downed my wings with a glass of Angry Orchard Hard Cider on tap. All of us observed that our server was a little inattentive. While taking our order, his eyes would flit to a big screen. He seemed a little distracted. He arrived with an inaccurate order. He apologized that he hit the wrong button. We had to wait longer for our wings. So, for tonight, service was the reason why we didn't give one of our favorite restaurants a higher rating."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of BWs and this one is the worst by far. I walked into the place and a young worker was leaning against the hostess station. I said \"hi\" and he literally scowled at me. No joke, he never said hi / just gave me a dirty look. I went and sat at the bar and the bartender was nice, but after my first beer sat there empty for 15 minutes, I decided to call it a night. Place was half full and service was definitely lacking."}
{"text":"Typical BWs, but they have this short, dark haired manager that is obviously suffering from short mans disease and he yells and talks very loudly. Everything else was great, but this guy yelling is killing me. It's ok, you're short - we don't hate you. Lower the volume dude."}
{"text":"I visited this location last night to watch the Patriots game since I'm from Boston and was in town visiting a friend. I had to say my experience was amazing. There was a drunk customer behind us who was harassing me and calling me derogatory names. My friend was upset and told the manager and he took care of the situation the right way. The heckling stopped and he made sure he checked on us numerous times. Then we went to close our bill. He took money off of it. I didn't expect that or didn't even ask for that and that truly made me feel so appreciative. I think the managers name was Dave. He is a great manager! Buffalo Wild Wings you are very luck to have such a great manager working for your company!"}
{"text":"The food was fine but the kitchen was way too slow. It took 40 min to get the food after we placed our order. The To-Go meal took just as long so I know it wasn't a fluke."}
{"text":"I get wings to go all the time. Asian zing and spicy garlic extra crispy. Best wings to go in the area"}
{"text":"LOST my take-out order AGAIN!!! I love BWW! Why do they continue to disappoint? Food is always great but customer service for take-out needs help.  Lost orders and delays? Maybe it is that the space needs to be larger or additional staff?"}
{"text":"I've been to BWW on two occasions and they both earned one star. First occassion I went with  my boyfriend and we were meeting up with a couple of friends. My boyfriend orders a beer and hands our waitress his I.D. She then proceeds to tell him that she needs TWO FORMS OF I.D. \"My drivers license isn't good enough?\", he says. \"No.\" responds the waitress. Uhhh, ok.   Second occasion was tonight 1/5/2010. A fundraiser for the Gilbert police officer that was killed in duty. Good cause, right? I figured I'd go with one of my good friends. Man we got the shittiest waitress ever. She has a snotty attitude the entire time and keeps talking to all her dumb  coworkers. Every time she screwed up it was \"Oh, I'm sorry I'm busy.\" Are you freaking joking me? We order our food and some of our friends join us. It takes her almost 30 minutes to bring us dessert which is fried churros and ice cream. I KNOW it doesn't take that long to bring my cold ass churros and melted ice cream to my fucking table. Don't worry.  I didn't tip.  I don't understand people who say ZOMG THESE FUCKIN WINGS ARE SOOOOOO GOOD!!!)$i(!! Because they aren't. They are mediocre at best. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"We eat here about once every other week. Try and go on Tuesdays cause it's a good deal (wing nite- 40c wings). I like the traditional honey BBQ. Not as big a fan of the boneless wings. Good beer. Can go with the guys to watch a game or take the kids as they have video games, trivia, etc. Have tried the burgers and other stuff and they are just okay. I stick with wings now. For what it's worth we also go to the Chandler mall one. They have a drier/crispy wing where as the Gilbert ones seem to be more wet/ more sauce. So visit the one you prefer."}
{"text":"Great customer service and good food.  Be careful though if you order takeout wings they may not be fresh.   Hit or miss....  Last couple of time I specifically asked them not to give me any re-fried wings then I still got some bad ones."}
{"text":"My favorite sports bar to watch sports games, and since its within walking distance of my house it's even better. I come here on a regular so the food is good and the drinks are just right.   Mango Habanero and Garlic  Parmesan are my favorite"}
{"text":"Came during happy hour ,and was charged regular price for happy hour specials.  Worst BBW in vegas. They don't honor there policy."}
{"text":"Called in a take out order around 6:30pm and they said I'd be ready in 30 minutes. Get there and our order isn't ready till 7:20pm. Live up the street so 5 minutes later we went to go enjoy our wings; cold, hard, boneless wings. Had to microwave our food so it was at least chewable."}
{"text":"First, this location was HORRIBLE....I will be contacting corporate. Whoevernwas working today at approx. 12:20PM, very rude. Orders are completely messed up! I ordered online for my order to be done by a specific time and it still wasn't. RIDICULOUS. Out of all Buffalo Wilds Wings, I have been to around the world, THIS LOCATION, doesn't open the food to confirm you have the correct order? I AM GLAD, I opened my food because it was wrong. Whoever the manager's are, walk around scary as can be. Everybody standing around talking. I see why this place is empty, YOU ARE HORRIBLE AND I WILL BE MAKING IT KNOWN. I wish I could have gave 0 stars!!!! YOU ARE HORRIBLE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Waitress, Betsy, was attentive and interactive with my party and food was good. Gave it a 3 star for the host alone who's name I did not catch.   We came in and politely asked for seating for my party. The host then follows it up with a \"no\". I understand it was a joke but it's a very tasteless joke that he should stop immediately. After explaining to us that it was a 20-30 minute wait because of lack of staff we agree to wait to be seated. 20 minutes or so after, a party that came in after us was seated before us and there was no explanation as to why but we patiently continue to wait to be seated. 10 minutes or so later he notices us sitting and asks us \"are you guys waiting for take out or?....\"  Extremely inattentive and flat out rude host. I planned to not tip but Betsy was very good so I tipped as usual. I'm sorry to all the waiters and waitresses that lose tips or have to deal with upset customers because of this host."}
{"text":"It was a great place to watch a game, enjoy an array of tantalizing wings, and wash them down with an average-priced brew. Besides the place being a bit dark, the location of BWW, the friendly staff, and the speed of service was exactly what we needed and received!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service and great staff, we ended up buying more then what we were because they made it sound so good and it smells good best bww we have been to thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Always a WIN! For a family friendly sports bar with great food - and fabulous service - shout out Patrick! - woot woot.   You cannot beat their deals for lunch time - fast break - every weekday from I wanna say 11:30-2:30.   Chicken wrap yum!, chicken salad delish, street tacos (winning), nachos cmon, and seriously - Mini Corn Dogs - Boom!   Grab a beer, dip some wings in some RANCH and then finish with some cheesecake bites - diabetes can wait!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Buffalo Wild Wings I've been to in Vegas. With that said, the overall service was terrible. I don't know if it was just something about today, but it took about 15 minutes to get our Ranch when it wasn't even busy. When we asked for more water it was only filled half way and our waiter just seemed like he did not care at all. In addition to that, the waiter barely showed up at all. Instead of checking up on our table we would have to get him ourselves. Never going to this location again. Cmon Buffalo Wild Wings, where's the management?"}
{"text":"Great except the wait for a waitress.  They were trying to figure out who was taking us. Food good!! Loved wedge potatoes! Yummy..."}
{"text":"Thanks fellow Yelpers for your reviews!  After reading, I chose the Gilbert location and knew I'd order wings since it was written BWW should stick to what they do best.  We were promptly greeted and seated.  Our server was both friendly and helpful.  At first glance the wing prices may seem a little high (at least they did to me).  Let me assure you the wings are not those from a cornish hen, size and quality are there.  We ordered blazin' and asian wings which were okay-plus,  served hot and fresh.  We also ordered the nacho trio which was quite interesting as it had ingredients you wouldn't normally expect - it says so on the menu so no surprise - the only downfall being fried diced chicken which quickly became soggy.  All in all - good.  I couldn't find prices on their \"drinks\" menu, this of course after having ordered.  Fearing the worst, the Bloody Mary my husband ordered was $6 - a fairly standard price every where.  As far as a sports bar goes, there are screens everywhere, large and small.  During our visit there was a hockey game on a projection screen and I could actually see the puck."}
{"text":"Service at the Las Vegas blvd location is always horrible except for the bar area. For some apparent reason I continue coming. Great bar food! Awesome beer!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with the time-tested combination of beer and wings? This specific location at the Galleria Mall had a corporate takeover in 2008, and things have gotten much better since then.  The last few times we've gone there, the food has been overcooked. According to the staff, the corporate managers fired everyone in the kitchen and replaced them with lower-wage workers. I guess you get what you pay for...  The bar staff is especially helpful, Megan, Fernando, Lysa, Sylvia, and Karena are great!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I expected for Buffalo Wild Wings, but it was not what we got; from this location any-how. I expected a modern looking dining establishment all about the Buffalo Wings. I did not expect a totally nondescript pub scene. I guess I expected celery crudité with bleu cheese dressing on the table. I did not expect an electronic trivia game with a console at the table (sort of what TGI Fridays does; in fact it may be the same network). I was thinking this would be the place for a young crowd; and while there were young people there it was also an older crowd.  So many things I expected, very few  expectations met.  What does it mean when I cannot determine what type of décor the restaurant designers were shooting for? Were they trying to make a unique statement? If so I have no idea what they wanted. If they wanted to be a sports bar they sorta succeeded at that, the monitors were ubiquitous. If they wanted to be a pub, I think they kinda covered the walls with pub'ish sort of stuff. If they wanted to make their customers comfortable they failed utterly with raw wood benches for the booths and chairs around the four-tops; however if the strategy was to get people in and out of the place they accomplished that. The course seating arrangements meant that I could not sit for long; but on the upside for Buffalo Wild Wings it means that they can clean up all the spilt sauce with no problem.  The food, yeah what about the food... There was nothing wrong about the food (although interestingly enough we were not attracted to the Buffalo Wings at all) but there was also nothing so unique about the food that made me go \"I got to have it\". What my wife and I both ended up with was the \"Burger Beef Stack\" which fell into the category of \"what's not to like\" (it was like brisket with an onion ring between two burgers on a bun, so what's not to like); however we both would have like to see the burger a bit more on the medium (or god forbid the medium rare) side, it would have made the whole thing taste better. For the potatoes we both chose the \"chips\" which were rather good. The food was all about \"what can we do with prepackaged food\", from the burgers to the desserts. With this attitude it is no wonder there is nothing spectacular here, but also nothing so wrong that it is offensive. I will however be eating wings and some of their like 20 sauces on the next go round (which should give you a clue where this review is going.)  The staff was well train if a bit on the over anxious side. I do not know what it is lately, that servers have to be so annoying and look for the tip so hard, but it seems to be the case in more and more establishments. Here is a clue for all you servers out there; like children, servers should be seen and not heard. It should go something like this: We see you when we are seated for drinks and specials, then we see you for our order (and give us about 5 minutes at least). Our next interaction should be when YOU serve us. Personally I do not like this idea of team service, others bringing out the food and then having to ask \"who gets the Limburger and Goat Cheese salad\". Other interaction should require little to no interaction. I expect you to refill my beverage when it gets low; I expect you to clear plates when I have signaled I am done by putting my silverware and napkin on the plate, or moved it to the side. When refilling water or iced tea, I expect you to lift my glass off the table and fill it over the floor where if it spills it will NOT get all over the table or customers. Optionally you can set a \"Drink Back\" on beverages that call for free refills (be remember to clear the empties when you have the chance). Otherwise I do expect a \"check up\" about half way through the meal and then after the main service with a dessert inquiry. Finally, serve out dessert and/or check promptly so we may leave when we desire. In the case of Buffalo Wild Wings, where the seats are so uncomfortable, the sooner we can leave, we will, and leave the booth open for no one to fill. The fact is the more attention you give us beyond a reasonable measure is just annoying. As customers we want to talk amongst ourselves, have a conversation.  But I must say someone is one the ball with this place, it is the first place that has enticed us into dessert in a long time; and I know why. Serving size. All the places around now seem to think the more the better when in truth the right amount the better. If you serve me a two pound burger, what are the odds I am going to be peck'ish enough to order dessert and up my bill by another $10? The amount of food served here was just right and I wanted a dessert to \"Fill in the Corners\" as JRR Tolkien once put it.  What it all comes down to is quirky but acceptable experience that I will visit again, probably soon. I will be back which should say more for the place than the whole review."}
{"text":"Wings are good, Mango Habenero is a great combination of sweet and hot. The beer is always cold"}
{"text":"Let me just say: this 3 star rating is relative to other BW3s. I find Buffalo Wild Wings to be a fantastic chain and always enjoy the huge variety of sauces they offer (not to mention that the Blazin' sauce is actually hot enough to register for this spicy food junkie). If you like chicken in wing, boneless wing or sandwich form they have you covered. You should also probably try the cheese wedges...and the chocolate cake.  That being addressed, this particular BW3s has its ups and downs. I have eaten there on a few occasions. On one visit my dinner companion asked for his wings to be double coated (once in sauce and once in one of their dry seasonings) and they failed to complete the second step. I'd love to tell you whether they still charged him for 2 flavors but he refused to let me near enough the bill to check. We made the mistake of returning on NFL opening night this week and had some trouble getting seated due to confusion caused by a large greek recruiting event and a poker tournament that were being held but after 15 or so minutes we were allowed to sit at the empty table in question.  The food is of comparable quality to most Buffalo Wild Wings and the servers are hit or miss, but I feel like that is to be expected since they are so close to the college (Yeah, that's right, I said it. Coed employees aren't always stellar.) Don't expect the world, but if you want a solid wings and beer experience you are not gonna be disappointed."}
{"text":"To be honest my wife and i go specifically for the variety of wings and the atmosphere. Nothing better than Mango Habanero wings, cold beer and plenty of tv's to watch your favorite game!"}
{"text":"This bdubs stays busy. There has never been a time I went and it wasn't busy. Some friends and I decided to get some wings and beer this past Monday. Of course it was Monday Night Football, so it was packed! They said 35-45 minute wait. So we put our name down and wandered into the bar to get a beer. Sure enough, there was a table open in the bar, so we just decided to sit there. Score, No wait! It was happy hour so the domestic beers and select appetizers were $3. We ordered the mozzarella stix, 6 per serving, and 3 Blue Moons. The stix came out quickly and were hot and cheesy. A few beers later, we ordered wings. I usually get the Asian Zing, but I wanted to try something new so I got Spicy Garlic. I have to say I should have stuck with the Asian Zing. Also they dont put enough sauce because my wings were on the dry side, so next time I will ask for extra sauce. What bothers me about this place is they nickel and dime you for every little thing, like ranch, which should come with the wings. It doesn't and they charge extra for it."}
{"text":"Wings were good/ hot/ large, but only ok overall.  Service was blah..../definitely seem to be bothering the staff by coming.  Bad first impression at front desk. By three ladies who told us to sit ourselves at the bar, 8:20 pm by the way. We obviously interrupted the bro time at the bar, mediocre service/ lazy draft pour. Not friendly, not worth the drive....."}
{"text":"This is the worst fuckin establishment I've ever been to. I come here at least once a week if not more. Just to have cold ass fuckin food brought to my favor every single time and let's not get started on laziest careless trash workers. Do not come here you will waste your money!"}
{"text":"We can't say enough good things about Brooke in the bar.  My wife and I are regulars at this BWW.  We always sit in the bar every Friday to watch games.  With the Knights advancing into the playoffs, we have been coming more frequently to watch their games.  What an amazing atmosphere here for the games.  We love being able to scream and cheer for our team, surrounded by others doing the same.  The best part of our experiences lately have been due to Brooke in the bar.  She is amazing!  Drinks are never empty, food is always hot, she knows our names, she makes us feel like we are at home, etc. etc. etc.  Luckily the Knights just advanced to the Conference Finals, so my wife and I will be hanging out here for at least four more games.  Seriously, this is the place to be for games.  Ask for Brooke to be your server, she's the BOMB!"}
{"text":"I had the grilled chicken sandwich. The tomato on it was green and hard. Very strange. My friends wings were cold. Should have known better."}
{"text":"We used to go to BWW every Sunday. My son loves the place. But, no kidding, the past 4 to 5 times we have eaten here I have had to get up and go track down a server. I am a server myself and I do understand \"things happen\" but, every time?? Now, we go a few miles down to Cooper Premium Pub on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Easy ordering can be done over the phone or online for pickup. I placed an online order for some wings on 6/28. I set my pickup time for 5:50pm. It was wing Tuesday so the bone-in wings were $0.69 each. I got 12 wings and 2 flavors; the Asian zing and garlic parmesan. I also added a side of wedges and a few ranches. One thing that bugs me is the dipping sauces are NOT included and are extra $$. To me, this is crazy. I understand if people ordered extra sauce, but no sauce at all? What is a wing without ranch?? It's sad and lonely that's what it is.   My total for everything was $15.62. When you first walk in, the pickup counter is to your left. Proceed there and a friendly staff member will assist you. I arrived a little earlier than my specified pickup time, so I waited a short while for my food to be done and then was on my way. I have to say I prefer the boneless wings to their bone-in because the wings are so huge and meaty. You might wonder what's so wrong with that and I just find that because the wings are so big, they are very chewy and fatty. Not very enjoyable imo. The wedges, meh. It said on the menu they are flavored with sour cream and onion seasoning, but I didn't taste nothing. All in all, this is not my first place choice for wings but I would come back for their boneless wings which by the way are discounted on Thursdays."}
{"text":"We live between the cedar Rd bw's location (which is great) and this location, we were over this direction and ordered takeout.  The order was wrong, took an hour to get fixed and they were rude and annoyed the whole time.  No apologies. Won't return."}
{"text":"Came here with my family and we had to wait a couple minutes before we got seated. Our waiter then took our order and all, then my brother told our waiter that it was our fathers birthday. We waited almost 20 minutes for our beverages to come and then right after, our food came. The food tasted great, and we waited a couple more minutes to see if the staff would sing happy birthday.. Nothing. It got late and we finally got our check and left."}
{"text":"Honestly, wings are probably my favorite food on the planet. I'll get them any way I can. BWW always has good variety and plays just about every sporting event known to man, which makes this place all the better for me. I'll be spending a lot of time here during football season. My new love is the Thai curry."}
{"text":"The food was fine, so I have no complaints there.  However, the wait time for food and drinks on this visit was just insane.  After being at our table for ONE HOUR we still don't have our food.  People around us have arrived, eaten, and left since we got here.  This is my first visit to this location, and I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Shout out to sheyenne for being friendly bout my friends and I walking in 20 mins before closing. Our server was friendly and helpful as well sorry forgot your name, but she was very entertaining, made us laugh and all. I love coming to this bdubs specifically due to the friendly staff. Great job guys got her name, Amanda ! Shout out to you girl"}
{"text":"Came here Friday night to watch the Suns game when they were playing the Lakers. There was also a baseball game going on. I sat at the bar ordered a beer, then I got their Mac and Cheese Bites and their Cali Chicken Burger. They are both delicious!! Love there are so many TVs in the restaurant, you will never miss a game no matter where you seat!! Would love to come back again!!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place is BAD! The wings were well below what I expected. The were not crisp and had a funny after tast. Also 14 wings for $17.99 is to high. The burger was also a let down. It was super bland and not with the price. The only good thing was the UFC fight was free. I would not go back even for the free fight."}
{"text":"I have personally had good and bad experiences at this BWW. Most of the time, I order my food ahead and pick it up since they are usually crowded and people are only seated on the first floor (instead of both the first and second for some reason). There was a time I ate there and my friend and I had a split bill. They charged me for both bills and my friend for her bill. They did void my second transaction, but it was taken out of my account and wouldn't be put back in until the following 2-3 days. They failed to tell me they charged my card for both payments and the money would not be sent back to my account for a period of time so I went on to go to the store afterwards with a declined card and was in complete shock. After getting my card declined and looking at my bank account I went back to BWW to tell them what had happened. They did not deny that they didn't charge me twice, but the manager did apologize for the waitress not letting me know that it happened."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game. I've been here several times when I'm back in town (lived here for 6 years) and never been disappointed. Tons of TV, great service and happy hour specials until 7pm during the week.  66 cent boneless wings on thursday. Worth it even though I live traditional better. I think that's Tuesday nights."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed this visit. Waiter Rich seems like there is a million places he would rather be. What a drag. Food was good as usually and price was normal but the service makes the grade and this grade I say is a solid D. Maybe next time Bdubs"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. This review reflects the to go accuracy. I understand busy because of football. But when I get home and am missing 20 wings, that isn't cool. I drove back, they knew who I was handed them to me from the back (so sitting awhile) and then moved on. Didn't say a word. At least acknowledge the mistake and we can both move on. That's all! Other then that. Love Buffalo Wild Wings. Great food!"}
{"text":"I've been here a dozen times or so, and never got around to writing a review, but I ate here again and the server was so attentive and gave us such great service, that I want to rate 5 stars just because of her.   Way to go MICHELLE ! For showing us what true customer service is all about.  Our drinks were NEVER empty.  She checked on us often, and tended to us quickly.  And Always with a smile.  She even remembered the little things we asked for, like random marinara for my friend who eats weird combinations Lol!  She is a keeper for sure. The whole table gave her an AAA+++  We were absolutely impressed.   On a different note, Food here is always delicious,  Buffalo Wild Wings is always a great place to grab a bite to eat with friends or family etc.  The dining room is always pretty clean, staff is always friendly, and servers are decent. (MICHELLE IS THE BEST)   Favorites for me are Mango Habanero Wings, Fried Pickles, Mac N' Cheese and their Street Tacos, oh and their Seasonal /Temporary items are usually pretty delicious, so don't be afraid to try something new !  Hands down a great BDUBS location."}
{"text":"Not impressed in the slightest. After helping my parents out with a long day of chores. Thought we'd come here to lead, eat some dinner, and have a few drinks. Couldn't even have a beer left my I'd in my car. And the owner won't let my mother order me a drink. We won't be coming back here for a long time.  Happy mouse is a much better environment with way better food anyhow."}
{"text":"The guy in the front says he's gonna go to the back to get our order. He comes back with some orders and sets them on the counter and starts helping other customers. Wait ten minutes and another employee asks if we are here for pick up. Say yes and she turns around and picks up our order and gives it to us.   We get home. We have a total of 36 wings. They give us 2 ranches.... how does that make sense?!   Wings tasted good though."}
{"text":"Just left after waiting 5 min to get seated. No one greeted us. Nothing! I'm in the service business and that had to be the worst! Won't be back"}
{"text":"This is a decent Buffalo Wild Wings location - mostly friendly staff, quick food service, and decent bar tenders. This particular restaurant is super close to my house and so my husband and I frequent here. Their rewards program is pretty decent if you come often. Staff is pretty friendly, though this location does tend to under staff during lunch which causes the servers to be super busy and they do their best to make you feel taken care of which I appreciate. This location shows a decent amount of variety on their TVs which is great since I don't have cable and want to catch a game on the weekends. They also have a pretty decent selection of beers (including seasonal) which is greatly appreciated. Their full bar also does not disappoint and drinks do not come out watered down (again, much appreciated!).  The only down side to this particular location is their parking situation. During big games/fights the lot fills up fast and you're forced to park in the dirt/rock empty lot right next to the building. Someone who owns lowered cars this is unacceptable. Mostly we stay away from this spot when busy and simply order food to go (they always have those 'to-go' only spots open)."}
{"text":"These guys never have my food ready when I place an order online.  This has happened numerous times. If online states my order will be ready at 4:40, then it very well better be ready at 4:40 not 4:55 or 5:00 or later.  I'm completely finished with this location. I was given the excuse that the order was taking a long time because I wanted the wings extra crispy :/ I'm calling BS.  I placed the order at 4:10.  It doesn't take 45 minutes to cook wings unless they had to kill the chickens in the process."}
{"text":"Honestly I only like the wings here and only when they cook them extra crispy and well done.  The wait staff is not very attentive which could be due to the lack of training which I blame on management.  The inside of the restaurant isn't that clean so I usually opt for takeout or I eat on the patio.  My tip is order online and take it home unless you enjoy the Buffalo's atmosphere.  Sorry I can't give this place 3 or even 4 stars.  If the service improves, then my review will as well ;)-\""}
{"text":"Our first time to this neighborhood location. Our server, Will, was great. Food was solid, drinks were great! We'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"By far the best wings I've ever tasted!!!  This was first time I've ever been here and it did not displease. Our waitress was very helpful and let us try out some of the flavors before ordering. We ended up getting the 50 piece with 5 different flavors. I was surprised to find that the salt and vineagar tastes extremely good! Desert heat was my first favorite! The next time we come here I am going to try the Mango Habenero. We didn't get it this time casue my fiance doesn't like spicy things too much.   I can't wait to come back and try out some more of these amazing flavors! And the burgers ;-)"}
{"text":"I have had nothing but great experiences at this restaurant. I have only eaten wings here, but they have a large selection of other food. The selection of sauces for the wings is large. My personal favorite is the spicy garlic.The wait staff is good. Good prices on drinks. I definitely would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Came all the way from SD and wanted some wings and expected it to be different here in Vegas but nope customer service still sucks up here too. Fix your service bdubs"}
{"text":"Bartender mad people are mad that none of their TVs work on a football Sunday.  Yeah get defensive instead of being nice about it.  Awful microwaved food on top of it.  Oh and clean your disgusting two lines once.  Amateur hour."}
{"text":"Staff was great but a strong sewage smell at the bar. Staff said it was due to the remodeling going on. It didn't make a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Not a good experience.  Wings were small and over cooked and over sauced.  The chicken sandwich was good, but you come to a place like this for the wings.  Wish the area had a Wild Wings Cafe..."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE SERIOUSLY!!! Incredibly rude had my party of 8 waiting 30 minutes at our table without even giving us menus... Unacceptable treatment we are the customer therefore we are the most important. Employees were too busy flirting to take care of guests. Did not even give us any refills or anything just terrible service. I will not stand for this type of customer service. Already calling the corporation tomorrow morning to get this settled. Will not be coming back. However that was the best root beer I ever had in my life. 3 stars."}
{"text":"Nice spot with good parking. Our waiter was pushy. He kept trying to get us to leave. We came to the restaurant to watch hockey and get to know each other and take our time doing so. We had to go home to feel comfortable. Not good. Wings were bad, but that's what happens when girls order."}
{"text":"We come here about once a week to watch games in the bar area. We always have great, quick service.  We don't get much other than the wings and an occasional appetizer, but everything has always been good!"}
{"text":"Wtf?! Everything is wrong, the server keeps messing up our orders , we asked for nachos without the bbq mustard sauce. And we got them with bbq mustard. -_-! My Bloody Mary sucks, doesn't have the pickle, olives and lemon inside the drink? I was promised a pickle it never came. By now I am so upset . The waiter won't admit he's wrong. We ordered 2 baskets of potato wedges with queso, he brought us the side that comes with the happy hour special. With little to no queso on them. We let him know that they are wrong. We wanted to big sizes to share? And he says he's trying to help us out?! What the heck ? How? That's not what we ordered . My mother in law ordered jalapeños and they never met came to her for her food. By now the pickle and the jalapeños are not here. He forgot about the pickle and he said the jalapeños would be out soon. Why would I even need them at this point when we already finished the food and my drink??? I'm furious at this point. I should have read the reviews.  Screw this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"I always love the food at Buffalo Wild Wings, so I decided to stop in for lunch today.  I got there at 1:00 and was surprised by how busy the dining room was. The hostess asked if I wanted to sit in the bar, which I normally don't like to do because most places put one bartender to serve drunks and also take care of food orders at the tables. Today was no exception I sat down and waited more than five minutes when as I was getting ready to leave the manager came up to take my drink order. He brought my drink and a menu. It took a bit for him to come back and take my order.  The food was as good as expected and no problems there. While I ate no one came back to see if everything was ok or to check if I needed another drink. Just as I was taking my last bite the manager came back by and said \"I'll bring you another Pepsi.\" He brought the Pepsi and then shortly thereafter brought the bill. The whole time I was eating I never saw a waitress go to any table to see how the patrons were doing only to drop off the bills.  Very poor service today.  At least the cooks were on the ball."}
{"text":"Its hot. Its Saturday afternoon and my husband and I had a desire to eat wings and drink beer. We also have a 10-month old baby and wanted to get him out of the house. Thank god for B-Dubs (the original bar's name and where I worked in the 90's as a bartender in Michigan.) I need to find out why there was a name change. BW3 was such a midwest fave.  We were seated immediately and our server's name was Kristi. She even wrote her name on our bev naps for us. Maybe its cheesy, but I like to know my server's name. We ordered some mini-corn dogs, fried pickle slices and boneless wings, along with some draft beers. Everything came out in great time and our beers were cold and food hot. We love fried pickle slices (not spears) and they were delicious. Since my husband and I enjoy watching sports and having a few beers, this will be a popular place for us to frequent since it is so close. There were many families in the late afternoon, which was great for us, and I don't think this should bother the non-children people out there. The TVs are loud enough to drown out children's screams or whines (our kid didn't make a peep and just smiled at everyone around us ;).  We will definitely be back. So happy to have a sports bar in our 'hood that has decent greasy food and cold beers on draft."}
{"text":"the angry orchard fiery apple sauce is really good and our server said it will probably be available into August 2015.  not fiery at all, great unique flavor.  they'll let u sample it on fries."}
{"text":"My father and I visited for lunch on a Sunday hoping to watch the baseball game and grab some lunch.   We were told to seat ourselves in the bar area and it took almost 15 minutes for our waiter to notice us. He explained that there were people in white who would being us free samples.   I was feeling light so I ordered the Chicken chopped salad. My father ordered the Streak Burger.   My father really enjoyed his burger. He had the parm/garlic sauce.   The chicken chopped salad was fresh but the chicken was cold. The sauce does not translate well when served cold instead I warm. The manager said that is the way they serve it now. She said next time I can order it warmed up or even crispy. We will see.   Usually great service can redeem any poor kitchen output. This was not the case with our waiter.  He was polite and all but seemed distracted or too busy to fuss Ruth has. Has to seek other servers for refills and it took him quite a bit of time to get us our bill.   That being said... When the bill arrived Bell the manager grabbed our bill and exchanged it. She comped my salad and next time she wants me to try it with crispy chicken.     I was planning on a 2 star rating but comping and entire dish is exceptional.   Manager Bell, not only have you earned a nice review but I will give your restaurant another shot but maybe with crispy chicken this time"}
{"text":"We all know that BWW is fire  so I'm gonna skip on how amazing my po boy sandwich was.   This is just a shoutout to Dani, the bartender. She is super sweet, quirky, and very attentive. Was only there for a quick bite and a drink and left 5 beers later. She's definitely a gem!   Always have had good times and experiences at this location. Maybe they should give some tips to their SW Durango location  just sayin."}
{"text":"Good at times and bad at times, food always good though. I am a regular says yelp but when this place first reopened it has been a slight change in quality. From great to gradually ok. This is not meant to bash, but be constructive criticism. As I am sitting here typing I have not got a menu yet...I did get my beer though, thanks for that. It's all about food and service food I give a B+ overall and service about a C- overall. It feels like servers at times are too busy being busy. A plus is they do smile, that's nice. I will continue to come back hoping for an improvement, but let's be real... It prolly won't change."}
{"text":"Best place to watch football (and other sports too I guess:))   Q is the greatest bartender and always has our drinks ready for us from the time we walk in the door.  Love the fatty food when you just want to let go, have great service, great sports, and good games."}
{"text":"Total 180 from my previous experience!  The food was supposed to be ready for pickup at 5PM.  I arrived at 5:02 PM.  I had to wait for 15 min which means they waited until I arrived to drop the wings.  So, what's the point in ordering online????  I was sick after eating the food too.  My boyfriend was as well."}
{"text":"good wings, but they are a little proud of them. over all good wing joint!"}
{"text":"The service here is the worst!  I guess people who work here hate their jobs and are frustrated like hell.  There was this server,  she goes by the name 'Sierra' has the worst attitude and tone ever!  She was talking to me like I would not even talk to my enemy.  Avoid this place like the plague or if you feel like running your whole day/evening with the service."}
{"text":"I just want to say that I went into Buffalo Wild Wing's last night, & I was greeted by, Kayla the server, Alexa was my bartender;  & Brian was the manager on duty...  Kayla was very approachable, & smiling, which is always great, bcuz there are too many humans that are just pissed off; for nothing... Alexa was very attentive, & explained in detail about the selection of alcohol, & food items; & her customer service was an A+. 100%  Brian the manager stopped by twice to check on my friend, & I, & was willing to handle any issues we had, but there were none; customer service was great...  & being that I am a former general manager of Subway, & Taco Bell, & now I own a very successful breast cancer awareness taxi service; called #icuPinkTaxi among other things...  I realize the one thing about owning a business, or running a business, is that customer service is the  \"Number 1 reason why this business, & my business, or any other business for that matter, will succeed; & fail\"... 1,000,000,00%  \"Side note, I will always choose this business (BWW), over any other sports eatery, bcuz of how inviting the employees make my friends, & I feel; (welcomed)...  The one thing most humans don't realize is that, you never want to piss off a taxi owner, or driver, bcuz one of the first thing a client/passenger; & the most frequent question asked is where's a great restaurant/bar to go to...  Definitely coming back to BBW\"..."}
{"text":"Ordered food through door dash. Our food arrived cold, the fried pickles were stale and potatoes looked like they were fried for 3 hours. The food seemed like it was cooked two hours ago and sat around. My husbands food was incorrect. He ordered bone in wings and got boneless. There was no phone number on receipt so we had to back track where our delivery map was and figured out it was here. Thanks for the $16 refund for the crappy food we got."}
{"text":"Super slow service although lots of employees standing around the hostess stand ordered a martini literally 3 sips of vodka and it was gone.   Will definitely not be back. Only positive thing is lots of TVs. Much better options around west gate. Don't do it! B"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings, BWW, B-Dubs, B-Wings, etc, is the epitome of decent sports bars in the area. It's great to have one around the corner, as well as one in the uptown area. If there is any major game, fight, or race on, this is the place to watch it.  The business more than adequately combines attributes of beer, food, and of course, TV's. There is a wide-range selection of beer, and a full bar. The menu is comprised of finger food to wings, to burgers, to tasty salads. The TV's are everywhere and most are between 40\"-80\".  What's good here- Start with a cold beer. They have specials EVERY day of the week, usually draft specials. The buffalo chips are always a good choice as an appetizer. The wings are very good (if not one of my favorites around the area). The burgers CAN BE very good, depending on how you order them. Medium-well is a little too \"well\" for my taste.   The TV's here populate almost ever square inch of wall space. With satellite, they USUALLY have every aired program (game, fight, race, etc.), for that timeframe, shown on AT LEAST one TV. Generally with fights, management will determine is there will be a significant \"turn-out\" to purchase the fight. Plan your excursions accordingly!  I've been out to a number of locations and have generally enjoyed them all. Although a location in Deleware ranks top, the university area restaurant in Charlotte is a very close second. Even though it is a small layout and fills up quick, the general atmosphere and service, once seated, make up for a wait. Service is \"as expected\", i.e. usually modestly paced for a larger crowd."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice in my life and both times the service was excellent, the staff were friendly and the food was fresh and delicious. I went for the traditional wing special on Tuesday and got 20 wings for the price that 10 would normally cost and the quality was still excellent. The loaded potato wedges were flavorful and covered in cheese and bacon. My mom loves the soft pretzel appetizer and she commented they were the best soft pretzels she's eaten. I went back a second time for the boneless Thursday special and I got traditional wings once again but my mom got boneless wings in medium sauce and they looked great. Crispy yet saucy, just how boneless wings should be. This is one of my favorite places to eat when on a low carb diet due to there being so many varieties of low carb sauces for the traditional wings."}
{"text":"mango habenero wings! yummmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!! by far this place is my fav chicken stop, and its open late night!"}
{"text":"Great food and an amazing location but don't expect to play and get comped drinks here. The bar staff is super upright and they comped me one beer after 125$ of play like okay cool"}
{"text":"This is going to be quick.  They offer a bunch of different seasonings and sauces for their wings and celery and carrots are included at no extra charge.   Every time I've visited, I've had a great experience. The food is prepared well and the servers are attentive, friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"There is almost no reason to go to BWW unless you're jonesing to play NTN trivia.  I used to be a regular here, sometimes coming as often as 3-4 times a week, and I one of their first customers on the day of their grand opening.  But better competition has moved into the Eastern Avenue market and BWW refuses to adapt.  The drinks are cheaper at Inn Zone down the street.  The food is better at Stadium Grille across the street.  The gambling comps are better at Doc Holiday's which has two locations in the area.  Every time I come in one of the four big TV's doesn't work.  And what kind of place doesn't serve you fries with your burger?  You have to order fries separately.  I still stop here periodically (usually when I want to play trivia) but to be honest, there are now better choices in the area."}
{"text":"This place is ruining the name of the company nationally. I have come multiple times, and it is never even close to decent. The only reason it is open is because people can tolerate it, not because it is satisfying. The boneless wings are really just fried breading with minuscule pieces of chicken. Last time I tried traditional and the wings were insanely small and weren't filling at all. Not to mention most of the staff are scumbags and come to your table as few times as possible, but hey! If you want to save money come here because you don't need to tip these poor excuses of human beings!"}
{"text":"This is a big empty sterile room pretending to be a sports bar. There are TV's everywhere; even screens inches from neighboring screens which created a strange alter viewing experience.    The service was pretty good but I don't really care for waiters that plop themselves down @ your table like you're old friends. Um, just take our order please.   The wings must be eaten that night or they get chewy and gross. You'll have to trust me.  We ordered the  Asian spicy wings, the mango habanero wings (serious emphasis on the HABANERO that blasts your tongue and lips w/ a relentless nerve dulling heat), and the salt/vinegar wings. They were all crispy and tasty but the celery/carrot side was far too small or perhaps it was because my mouth was on fire and I needed to extinguish the pain but my prayers went unanswered. Order /eat the hottest ones last or you won't taste ANY flavors that follow.   I just wasn't impressed with the decor nor the general vibe of the place. I see it as more of a wing/beer joint for tables of college or high school boys and men just back from hunting bears. Seriously, it's more of a dude kinda joint which is fine.  Their wing serving sizes are really great because you can order 6 wings w/ each flavor you choose. Nice option.   Beer was cold and there were good solid draft options."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this location friendly, fast and delicious food!! The waiting staff is always smiling and enjoying their work!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever been to a BWW and ordered take out.  Now it was packed in there because of football but I didn't have to wait to long for my food.  I got 5 different flavors, sweet bbq, spicy bbq, asian zing, spicy garlic and medium.  I really liked the asian zing!  Courtney, who checked me out, was super busy but still took the time to check everyone's to go orders to make sure everything was there, great customer service.  The celery was missing from my order, an oversight on my part as well since we went over the order together.   My only problem was the packaging, what a huge waste! It seems they only have one size box and it is huge.  They really need to have smaller sizes and not be so wasteful."}
{"text":"My husband, Son and I visited this location on their \"Grand Reopening\" and it was weird to say the least.   Buffalo Wild Wings is pretty consistent from location to location. Their food is consistent, and tasty.   What I want to talk about in this review is the service. Which was... not spectacular. I recognize and acknowledge \"Grand Re-Openings\" are hard. They're busy and things can go wrong.   They ran out of boneless wings, they ran out of diet coke, and the waitress didn't even apologize. She just continued to tell me how busy they were, and that it was a grand reopening.   I don't expect something for free, but I do expect you to acknowledge long wait times, I do expect the manager to stop by and check (and if they did, I don't even recall it was so brief) and I expect you to try and make things right when you're out of what we ordered (after ordering, and waiting for a while...)   I'll be honest, we'll probably return because it's so close to home. I'm hoping to update this review once the kinks are ironed out."}
{"text":"WORST wing place ever food is mediocre but service is just terrible and no point of complaining about it because no one, including the manager will be apologetic about it."}
{"text":"Great drinks! Great food! Great wings! Never really liked wings till I ate here...  Its all about Spicy Garlic wings with blue cheese!!!  And the nachos are the sheit too!  Open 24 hours so its a great after work spot"}
{"text":"I wish my friends would stop asking to meet here. The service has never been good. It took our waitress 7 minutes to stop by and say \"ill be right with you.\" This was after I heard them loudly arguing who's table we were. I guess they dont have a rotation or section figured out.   Regardless, we ordered and it took 12 minutes to get our food. Not bad, but my friend's fries were cold and the waitress never came back to check on our drinks or anything until she passed by to drop off the check.  My group has an obsession with the variety of flavors BWW offers. And I admit, its nice to try something other than just plain hot at my regular bar, but its not worth the headache of coming here."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the chicken was even worse.  Bland no seasoning server bought extra sauce didn't make it any better.  Manager came out she had attitude asking what's wrong with the chicken I can bring you guys some extra sauce which we already had or you guys can try a different sauce.  The whole experience here was absolutely horrible I will never step a foot in another Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Best. Wings. Ever. If you haven't ever tried their Terikayi wings they are to die for, they are the perfect mix of sweet and salty and crispy and amazing. I always get a side of buffalo chips with Ranch and the combo is perfect. Wash them down with some iced tea and you're golden! I also really enjoy their garlic parmesean wings, which seem to be made with real garlic (they have that tiny bit of spicy that hits your tongue) and parmesean. All around great place!"}
{"text":"Given the location, next to the convention center, I'd have thought they would be prepared for busy weekends.  There were 4 people in our party.  Appetizer took awhile.  Once the main coarse order was taken, we were told they were out of salads, but no menu was brought to make another selection.  The person who ordered the salad, but had to change the selection got food 10-15 minutes before everyone else.  The waiter was not engaged in our table until the very end when an explanation was being made as to what happened and why the promised discount wasn't applied the first time; moving on to the next task/table before finishing with us; almost annoyed by questions.  Water cups were also mixed up, if you're going to take cups please make sure you bring them back to the correct person! Serve was not great by the wait staff or the kitchen or the manager.  Sad because I'm sure they could have more business and better tips."}
{"text":"I came here for a pick up order and it took me and the other lady that was waiting almost 20mins! I did an online order, and said be there at 2:10... Then she hands me the food and thank god i checked it because my fries were missing!! They need to work on their pick up order service!"}
{"text":"BWW is only ok. It'll do when you're hungry. Our waitress was friendly but impatient. She came to our table 5 times in a 10 minute span to place our order."}
{"text":"Not worth the price. They make you wait longer and short you on the number of wings."}
{"text":"your average BWW,  pretty clean, good items on the menu Clean awesome TV's"}
{"text":"FOOD WAS NASTY!! Worst food I've had there! The service was perfect tho great people. The wings tasted like  water down sauce cold onion rings and nasty fries, so disappointed!!"}
{"text":"As someone who loves wings more than life itself, I feel it's a bit unfair to review a place that's known for its wings but here we are.  I've been here multiple times and really can't say anything bad. Staff are always friendly, but it's not uncommon to not see them for long stretches if they're especially busy. It comes with the territory though.  Always a great beer selection and food is always good. I opt for the wings almost 100% of the time and am rarely disappointed. I appreciate the variety of flavors they offer so it's hard to get burnt out on flavors.  Keep up the good work BDubs. You'll always have my business."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get wings so far.  So many choices"}
{"text":"No. Just no. Out of multiple take out experiences and many Dine in, no one pays attention in the kitchen. There is no quality control check. There is no reading the tickets. Every time I have gone there something has been wrong. Chickens not seasoned, salad is wilted, wrong dressing, wrong veggies, etc etc. And it's not like it's cheap so I expect correct food. Yes the service is good and everyone is nice but I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Some of the people who work here can use a lesson in customer service...I ordered take out on the phone and got two orders of wings.  I asked for extra ranch on both orders.  Each order already comes with one ranch so that means I should get a total of at least four ranches (more if they're nice).  When I paid for my food at the restaurant I politely said, \"hey, can you make sure that there's extra ranch in there for me?\"  The girl looked at me like she was annoyed by my question and said \"yeah.\"  When she brought out my food she handed me the bag, I said thank you, and she walked back into the kitchen without saying a word.  I looked in the bag and there were only 3 ranches in there, which was no big deal, so I asked the hostess if \"it would be possible for me to get a couple more ranches.\"  She said \"yeah sure\" and went in the kitchen, then came back out and said \"umm it's gonna be an extra 60 cents per ranch.\"  I said \"ok, but I did order extra ranch on the phone and I only got 3 in here.\"  She told me that if I order extra ranch I should only get \"like 3 or 4.\"  I didn't feel like arguing so I gave her the $1.20 for another two ranches.  I'm a little agitated that I was treated like some kind of a**hole when I don't think I could have been more polite.  I don't really care that I had to pay extra for the ranch.  I was more concerned about the way these girls were talking to me.  I work at a restaurant so I know that some customers can be a**holes, but there's no reason to treat polite customers like a**holes just for asking for extra ranch."}
{"text":"The one thing I will give these guys credit for is great front counter customer service. We asked for water upon arrival to pick up wings and they gave us to-go cups. The wings are disappointing, small in size and they are stingy with their flavored sauces. The online ordering system was down when we tried ordering...the next week was the same issue. We gave them a second chance to be better and we've completely stopped going because the quality of their wings, sorry guys, thumbs down to this one."}
{"text":"To the guest who complained about crispy wings. This policy has been in place for over a month at this location. As far as them not being busy, you never know what's really going on unless you're in the kitchen there. Sounds like you went during lunchtime and takeout is usually a nightmare all day. Cut them a break. They're just trying to accommodate all the guests, not just the minority who prefer crispy wings. You have 6 other days to enjoy that modification. Unless they don't serve a quality product or the staff/manager was rude I don't see a reason not to continue to visit this location. They've always been great!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, this was my first experience eating Hooters and I was disappointed.  I ordered wings and the nachos through Yelp delivery and everything about my order was bad.  Wings were cold and damp from the grease cooling off. And on top of all that, they were breaded wings so you know that came out gross. My two order of the original wings came with one small taco shop sized container of bleu cheese minus the cheese... I really like the cheese that's in bleu cheese.  Nacho were okay.  Soda was kind of flat but was the best part of the order. As I type this, my stomach feels kinda sick from the wings.  Yelp app said that my order would be ready in a out an hour. Well, 2 hours later and after a phone call to Yelp, our order was finally delivered. I realize that it might not be the restaurants fault, but it's part of the deal of running a business and I was super disappointed with the service.   My suggestion is to turn around. I doubt this is a complete reflection of Hooters, but I'd suggest finding a different location if you want wings."}
{"text":"We took our food home to finish later that evening. Bit into a \"boneless chicken\" and immediately spat it out due to the soapy painful taste.  Inspected the chicken to find it was not chicken, but some crumbly white substance, like soap or a candle? Hard to explain but we have a video pulling apart the \"chicken \" if youd like to see. What was that????   Besides that our fries were cold. Onion rings were okay. Chicken was horrifying"}
{"text":"I love their chicken tender salad with parmesan garlic sauce on the chicken.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Staff was nice, but this location is very dark, the wings were subpar (chewy, yet hard, lacking in flavor), and the vibe is weird to say the least. Still a B-Dubs, but don't set your expectations too high on this"}
{"text":"Great service from our server, but there was an annoying employee obnoxiously singing opera constantly as we dined."}
{"text":"Short staffed so the service was good for the situation. Food was good, my only problem is they aren't showing the Arizona state game on the big screen. Can't believe the fan base here...leaving at the half"}
{"text":"It's not a bad place to get some good wings and some beers. Especially when you compare them to other wing places in the area. BWW has some of the best flavors to choose from including sauces that are actually hot not ones that claim to be hot. If you name a sauce suicide or diablo it better be eye watering, mouth burning, poop on fire the next day hot! Blazin and mango habanero do that for me. The service is pretty good and usually fast. Plenty of tv's to watch your sports games, air conditioned, and a decent amount of beers on tap. The wings here are the biggest I have seen around... Can't complain."}
{"text":"Busy thursday slow service. There was a bug in my beer. And the server wasnt attentive"}
{"text":"Only because you have to give it at least one star. Used to come here with my son once a week until recently we started getting such rotten service. Waitresses will not wait on us , they just keep us waiting for more than 20 minutes. This has happened on more than one occasion which is too bad because we liked the atmosphere and I really tipped well but enough is enough. I will no longer frequent this location. I will not keep spending good money to be treated like the bottom of the trash barrel. I hate to play the race card but a group of white men came in after us and received their food while we had yet to even see our waitress. Avoid this location like the plaque."}
{"text":"I normally only review businesses where I have positive statements to make.  I feel that my bad experience at a location does not necessarily mean that the restaurant should suffer for it, because your experience might be better than mine.  However, I am so put off by this place and multiple bad experiences that I truly feel the need to warn EVERYONE from going there.  There are LOTS of other choices in Charlotte, no need to support this business that treats customers so poorly.  We had a reservation to start my Bachelor Party here, due to the convenient location of being next to our hotel (not due to positive experiences in the past, that's for sure).  The reservation was made weeks in advance & would have been between 10  - 14 adult males all drinking alcohol and devouring wings and appetizers, etc for a few hours before moving the party to a more adult-oriented location..   The tables were not ready on time.  Not really a problem, that's ok.  We can work with that.  The hostess showed us a small table (8 top) that was ready immediately, as well as the table(s) where we would prefer to be located, but we needed to wait 10 minutes.  We chose to wait for the larger table.  We stood at the front for over 30 minutes.  Those of us made to stand at the front and wait included my fiance's 75 year old father and my 65 year old father!  The hostess offered (again) to put us at the smaller table (8 top), or we could wait for the big table.. Again we chose to wait for the larger table, as we knew that the 8-top was too small.   They told us our table was ready after 35 minutes of waiting, and the manager was there helping to set the table.  The problem was:  the table was the smaller table that we were offered over 30 minutes prior.  When I questioned the manager about it, and pointed to the tables behind us where we had been promised, he said that larger set was going to a party of 20 that was a WALK-IN behind us (a group of teenage volley ball players).   I explained what we just went through, all the waiting, and the communication with the hostess, that we had a reservation for weeks - and they were not ready for us, and we had been waiting over 30 minutes for that particular table, and now he was suggesting he was going to give it to the party of 20 teenagers who cannot even order a drink from the bar?  He said, \"no I am not planning on giving it to them, I AM giving it to them\".  We left, as I would not let any of my friends or family spend single dime in a location that would talk to us that way; and we spent over 3000 dollars in food and alcohol at the Wild Wing Cafe around the corner (located in the Epicenter).  I sure hope those teenagers were able to order a LOT of wings to make up for the loss of income to the bartenders!!   Do yourself a favor.  Do not eat here & support businesses with poor customer service in today's economy!  There are plenty more deserving businesses in Charlotte that deserve the patronage, because they care!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this B-Dubs since I was 15...almost 11 years. I won't even go to the one on North 5th because I have never had any problems with this store and its service. I placed an order on the phone with Niko and he made sure my order was to the point and correct. When I walked in at the minute he said it would be ready, there it was waiting for me. They made sure my food was to order and to my liking. Great service and welcoming."}
{"text":"Ordered a pick up order and timed my distance to about 15 minutes out. Phone communication was normal, no attitude and received the order without trouble. Person said my order would be ready in 15 minutes so it seemed perfect. Once I arrived, the staff was friendly but very stiff. Offered the greeting then went on like a robot doing their job. It did not look busy inside at all but they were moving around not in a hurry but as if they were behind on something. Maybe it was my order. I did arrive exactly 15 minutes later but still had to wait another 15 minutes there by the front door. Not sure if this was a young staff with poor leadership or just a new place where things aren't running smoothly yet. Regardless, was craving some wings and got the same ol, same ol. Wings are just average but Im sure ill find the good wings in the area later."}
{"text":"OMG!  This place is busy BUT we were sat and waited at least over 20 minutes to order wings.  It has now been over 45 minutes and we are still sitting here without our wings.  We have seen one table walk out and another table go and complain.  All the diners are sitting looking around wondering where the food is???  Normally you see food coming out of the kitchen but not here!  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with tonight's service. Ordered on their website for pickup. I was given a pickup time of 50 minutes later! When I got there, the food wasn't ready. I get home and I'm missing an order of 14 wings! Called them up and they said come back. 15 minute drive back and food wasn't ready. After we received food, we didn't get any reimbursement for our troubles. I'm wondering why I gave a 15% tip for this pickup order.   This was the 2nd time we've done a to go order and it's been bad. The fries both times have a serving size of a happy meal fry, and it's $3."}
{"text":"First time to Buffalo Wild Wings. This is how you do SERVICE! Not only was the food delicious, but the To-Go service was fantastic. The gal working the counter went 10 steps beyond to make us happy. I just called and told the manager what a great job everyone did. I love good service!  The wings were super yummy. I think I will order them \"wet\" next time because the sauce is so good, but other than that, perfection. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Truely unwelcoming place for handicapped people. Iam hurt and offended by the manager Dereks or Erick, lack of knowledge towards confronting handicapped people. Do not eat here. Bad management with a temper."}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot.. The young lady who seems like Manager had no apologies for their fault serving for the wrong size beer. She only  mentioned she cannot discount with no apologies. Treat me like idiot complaining about nothing.  rude.. we didn't want the discount. Just say sorry in that case... will never come back again."}
{"text":"Good food but the service here definetly needs an upgrade! Service was horrible, they had a huge line for there takeout and all the employees are just walking by and no ones not even trying to help. When I order food to go especially during lunch time I would prefer it in a timely fashion because I definetly dont have a half an hour to wait on it!"}
{"text":"Servers ask you every two minutes if everything is OK - not enough clients, too many servers with too much time on their hands! Boneless wings are terrible. Way too dry.  Regular wings OK but nothing to write home about. Finally, the music is blasting at lunchtime, more for the young staff than the middle-aged clientele. I've been there 3 times but won't be going back."}
{"text":"I like to think I have a pretty good eye for restaurants - simply eyeballing a place will usually tell me roughly how good it's going to be.  I eyeballed this place and my intuition told me: BAD.  Or at least generic.  Big sports bar, cheesy gimmicks, giant TV's, overly perky waitresses, a huge meandering menu, and empty tables everywhere.    But it was the only thing open at that hour across the expressway from my hotel so I didn't listen to my intuition, which was a good thing because it turned out to be great.  Dan ordered this monstrosity-sounding thing that was like a steak quesadilla stuffed with french fries.  It came with the most nuanced salsa ever.  I mean, I could taste every little spice that went into that bowl separately in my mouth, and every one of them tasted fresh.  In addition to that, the quesadilla wasn't too greasy, the steak was not overcooked, and the french fries were somehow, despite being mashed into a quesadilla and fried, not mealy.  Yum!  My hot garlic chicken wings, despite being placed roughly in the middle of the spice indicator on the menu, were so hot that when I brought them to my face I started coughing before they made it to my mouth.  However, when they actually did make it to my mouth, it was a slow-burning spice, one easily extinguished by the bleu cheese dressing.  Which was bland and slightly chemically on its own, but served its raita-like purpose nicely.  Were I ever to be in Monona, WI again (somewhat unlikely) I would come back."}
{"text":"I have stopped in here 3 or 4 times now. I have had Melissa as my bartender every time, and she is never lacking a smile, attentiveness, or efficiency in greeting or serving me and making me feel welcome. The service and salt & vinegar wings keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Vegas littered with advertisements saying open 24/7, which is a lie because they're currently under construction.   How about taking those damn signs away if it's not true?"}
{"text":"UFC 143;    Service charge of 18% added to bill; never saw that before for 'events' nights? Free 6 wing coupon not honored by management -  Restrictions apply! Where does it say that on the invoice used to fill out the on line survey??  Also, when the coupon will be honored?--  States to present within 14 days. Mine was from the previous week, but manager said had to be 3 days?  HUH  Poor management and customer skills -  makes up stuff when confronted with facts and refuses to discuss further.  Note:  the wings were not good on this visit  South Strip; Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar with a clean and open atmosphere.  Found a great seat quickly off to the side of the busy bar where I could people watch.  My server, Ennio was johnny-on-the-spot with a menu and drink suggestions. He even suggested waiting a few more minutes for the 10pm happy hour!  I gratefully accepted and respect him for informing me!  He came back promptly at 10pm for my order.  I decided to trythe the Parmesan garlic chicken wings, a shot of Di Saronno liqueur and a tall Blue Moon with an orange slice to wash it all down!    What can I say! Everything was superb! The Parmesan garlic wings where cooked to perfection, the garlic parm sauce was OMG delicious! Not to garlicky with plenty of the wholesome Parmesan cheese flavor!  Celery sticks arrived but sadly, accompanied by a teeny weeny ranch sauce which was much to scrawny with only a half shot or so of ranch dressing for dipping. I definitely expected more dippy sauce for a half dozen wings and a load of celery sticks.  A place like this should know better than to go skimpy on sauce! Shaaaaame!  Hahaha!  Over all, I thoroughly enjoyed the food, drinks and atmosphere. The staff was fully attentive and happy to serve.  I'll be back with friends for sure."}
{"text":"We order take out every Tuesday for their 60 cent wing special. We've visited this location at least a dozen times and have never had an error on a take out order and the wings are always cooked properly and seasoned well. We are working our way through the flavors. I highly recommend any of the dry rubs (distinguishable by the use of \"seasoning\" in the flavor name). The sweet bbq and honey bbq flavors are our 5 year old's preferred flavor. I'm a big fan of traditional wings and my husband and kid prefer boneless. The boneless wings are all reasonably sized/shaped and you definitely feel as though you've received the same amount of meat. Also, you may receive a survey on your receipt with a $5 off coupon, which if you're a weekly visitor will be surely used within the 14 day expiration period."}
{"text":"You will definitely find a style of wings that you love... Try the Lemon Pepper!  The service is really good and prices are very reasonable.  BTW, great for kids!  Oh, and if you're interested in sports, they have just about every game on... It is cool!"}
{"text":"Decent enough... They were super busy, as the NFL playoff games were being shown. Service was expectedly a bit on the slower side because of that, but they didn't rush us or pressure us to order more food/drinks while we were there.  I found the mango lemonade to be super sweet. We got the nacho burger and fries, which were both way too salty. The wings, however, were good.  Lots of TVs, and they happily split the checks and prepared a to-go order at our request."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I want to give them 4, but I won't. That being said, I would definitely come back for more, i'm just saying my experience probably could have been better. I don't hate it at all, so don't take offense to the 3 instead of 4 star :P.  Got in, they had a nice dining area, or the bar, you get to choose where. There are Tv's wall to wall showing whatever's good, and even one showing a digital poker match going on inside the bar, which is pretty cool. The menu was great, the prices were decent, my brother and I split 6 mango habanero, 6 asian zing, and 6 chipotle. Then we also split mini corndogs (half off for happy hour), and a basket of potato wedges (not half off). The chipotle wings were crap, it was like they cooked wings and seasoned them and served it to us, just tasted like dry salty wings. The asian zing had a nice crispy spicy and sweet glaze on them, similar to a spicy zing i've tried before, very good. The mango habanero was the bomb though, glazed a bit, slightly sweet, with a kick of habanero, delicious! I tried mango habanero somewhere else before, and man it tasted like shit, it was like saucy and wet mango curry was on the wings or something. But Buffalo wild wings did mango habanero right! The mini corndogs were pretty good, though they forgot to give us the \"honey mustard\", which when we requested it didn't taste like \"honey\" mustard at all, just normal mustard, whatever though. The potato wedges were great! They had a nice seasoning to them, slightly less undercooked compared to that of KFC's, which I would prefer more, but these were delicious enough  Service was decent, but could have been better, they didn't seem to pay much attention, they were having more fun with their co-workers, which is fine by me, I don't blame them, work can get boring sometimes.   As a generous yelper, I'm so tempted to give them a 4 star rating.. No harm to ya though Buffalo Wild Wings, I'm sure the next time I come around I'll have a better experience, and I will be back for another round for sure :)."}
{"text":"Bad service. They always say there's a wait when there is a ton of tables open. A lot of the workers look at you and walk away without acknowledging you. We got there a half hour before closing and they hurried us up to order drinks and food fast because the kitchen was closing... We still had a half hour. Plus they turned on the lights trying to slowly kick everyone out. Super rude and inconsiderate"}
{"text":"J.D. Was our server & he gave great great service. He should be working in fine dining! Very polite & friendly. BWW is a very fast paced casual restaurant so I don't ever expect service to be top notch. It def was tonight. & it was the basketball finals!"}
{"text":"Longgggg time to get the drinks, longgggg time to get the food, untrained personnel,  dry food, poor quality ingredients,  huh....I give it 2 stars for their sauces...but would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Slow service, especially on game day. We've waited an hour for our food... granted it was during a World Cup game, but they should be prepared for this sort of thing.  Apparently the kitchen was backed up. If you have the capacity for hundreds of people to be seated, you should be ready to serve that many people.   My black bean burger came out overcooked and hard.   We waited another 20 min for our check, delaying my friend from getting back to work.  I will only come back if friends are here for a game, and even if so, I will suggest going elsewhere.  **Edit: Called and got a $25 food credit for the year. That was nice of the manager - but still - unless something really changes, then I wouldn't suggest coming here."}
{"text":"WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER!!  I waited more than 30 minutes for my food & the funny thing is that it wasn't even busy.  The guys name was Andrew. (He works graveyard) How can he still work there when he's always in a bitchy mood. This is not the first time. The last time he cursed at me because i was wearing a hoodie. (It was cold & raining.)"}
{"text":"Just left BWW and the service was excellent.  I placed a to go order and Rhei was awesome.  Good job.  This is my favorite BWW."}
{"text":"Got my order horribly wrong and the food was disgusting. I've been to other Buffalo Wild Wings locations and this has been the worst so far. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I like buffalo wild wings but this place was not good either of the two times I was there.  My girlfriend lived in this area and she joneses for BWW more than I do so this was the one nearby.  It is busier than the one I go to so for that atmosphere it is good for a good time but the food and service was horrible.    The wings were cold when they came out and I order cajun style buffalo chips which came out with no seasoning and it took me to ask the waitress 2 times for her to bring it.  Then she brought a pinch more than a pinch of seasoning.  We were there for over an hour and it was like trying to pull teeth to get another beer.  The waitress was chatting up a table 2 down from us but didn't seem to care that she had other tables.  I wish I remembered her name.  The table next to us was chatting with us on how horrible she was.  This is the first time in years that I remember wanting to not leave a tip at all.  My girlfriend made sure we didn't and left her a note as well.    I mean two beers in over an hour at a bar I could get more than that at church and probably better food."}
{"text":"2 years or so ago I used to frequent this BWW.  It was close by and the bartenders rocked.  When my favorite bartender left I didn't come in as much.  With that being said out of the 6 or so BWW I have eaten at in Vegas this is still my favorite.  The wings usually come out hot and I have not really had any problems with my simple order.    I order the same thing every time 12 wings 6 hot and 6 spicy garlic with potato buffalo chips cajun style.  The most frequent complaint I have is they forget to put the cajun spices on the buffalo chips, but this happens far more often at other BBW...  It isn't as busy as some of the other BWW, but the food is better.  So if you are going for the party I would not recommend it but if you want the best BBW wings in Vegas check it out."}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings is clean, friendly and fast. I have always had a pleasant experience with either dinning in or getting take out. Last night I called an order in and arrived early, I was offered a drink while I waited and the staff was very accommodating."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some wings and a buzz. My bar tender Kiersten was great!! I never waited for a drink and she was very friendly. this is most def one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Great wing's and atmosphere. Great for watching the games.. Football, college football, basketball."}
{"text":"Ordered the fried mushrooms for 6.49 plus tax  thru door dash. Learned my lesson, received 9 mushrooms. That's 72 cents each mushroom. Come on!!!! So so wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Fun place that my kids love. Not as clean as I'd like, just a little grimey, but I guess that's to be expected at a wing joint? The wings are good but I swear they're shrinking in size. Of course, great service as most Buffalo Wild Wings. Parking is a B at this location, though."}
{"text":"20 wings for $21??  Are you kidding me?  Also, if you're not going to put prices on your menu, then your wait staff should know the price of the beers, especially the ones that you \"feature\".  Editing:  gave an extra star because the wings are actually REALLY good and crispy but am sticking to my opinion that NO WING is worth $1.00+. As one other reviewer said, they're really stingy with the sauce."}
{"text":"Good service. Fast, and if they are they make sure to at least acknowledge you vs ignore you. But never a lengthy wait for service. Drinks and food are good, friendly staff and like the games you can play."}
{"text":"I love you BDubs, but you're making it hard for me to like you. Please stop trying to nickel-and-dime your patrons, okay? When you offer a happy hour well wine pour of 6 ounces for $4, don't charge me for a 9 oz pour at $9. Obviously, I could order two six ounce pours for a grand total of $8 and 12 oz of liquid libation - considerably more happy for less dollars, yes? Why on Earth, would I order one 9 oz for at $9?  (Especially, when I pointed at the happy hour menu and said I would like this one please.) Also, I get that the dressing is expensive. Really, I do. So when I order the large Wings to share with a party, and I order the dressings as appropriate (you get four delicious cups of something with a large), and want a little extra celery on the side, charge me for a celery. Don't charge me the extra for the dressings, m'kay? (For those playing the home game, the celery is a fraction of the cost of a cup of dressing... especially since the celery is always \"Just One Last Breath\" shy of its untimely death...) This nickel-and-diming busines is very upsetting and, quite frankly, unnecessary. If I'm coming here once or twice a week, all you're going to do is alienate a loyal customer and I'll end up just making my wings at home. I beg you... knock it off. Because, seriously, I will honestly stop coming here for my wing fix. At a minimum of $50/wk, I can seriously be annoyed elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming  here great food and beer awesome place to watch game and even play a game with there tablets quiz games. B-dubs is the best place for wings and sauces.can never go wrong with hot food"}
{"text":"As usual a great spot to go watch sports. Happy hour is always the best time to go here and the fact that this  BWW is open 24/7 and a walking distance for me makes it the best spot to go on a night out. I love the steak burger and most of all the cheap beers during happy hour. Love the vibe as well since I'm a huge sports person."}
{"text":"This BWW is like the epitome of what all BWWs aspire to be!  It looks like its straight out of a commercial.  They are very well staffed, which is rare for most restaurants.  Perfect place for watching a televised event- there are large tvs everywhere you look!  The decor is super up-to-date and modern.    My bartender was on point, not too talkative but had a great personality and great service.  I'll definitely be back when I'm in Monroe!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the other day, we had a really bad experience.  We waited 10 minutes to be seated, our waitress didn't come to the table for close to 15 minutes. We placed our order for dinner and waited another 20 minutes for the food to arrive.    We ordered a basket of frys, carrot and celery 10 spicy garlic, 5 mango habinero,  and 5 of their new flavor angry apple. The wings were very dry, they really skimped with the sauces.   This was by far the worst bww location I have ever been to, I will not be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"As an avid Yelper, I should have taken the reviews of my peers more seriously.   I was in the parking lot on a Sunday morning waiting on another business to open and wanted some wings so decided to stop in and give BWW a shot, despite the low Yelp rating.   Probably 10 people in the entire restaurant (1 other at the bar) when I walked in @ 1135. The bartender took my food order at 1140 and my wings finally came out at 1205. I only got water, it was never refilled.   The bartender (Gloria) was nice but never checked back in with me once between 1140 and 1225 when I got my check. (Another waitress bought out my food.) I got up and got my own salt, pepper,  and ketchup from another table as to not disturb anyone.   2 servers and the bartender were in the corner eating and socializing pretty much the entire time. BWW should be embarrassed.   As for the food, it was pretty pathetic. Wasn't even piping hot when it came out. A little better than room temperature and the sauced wings were semi-dry.   Needless to say, I definitely won't be back and I don't recommend you go either."}
{"text":"always good food good drinks and great atmosphere! Less than a mile from my house makes it all the better! LOL"}
{"text":"Ok, haven't been to a BW3 in a while.  The one closer up me closed.  Came today with the kids. I was pleasantly surprised.  Our server was awesome, very attentive.  Had minicorndogs.  Jud kids loved them, I thot ok but I don't love corndogs. Fried cheese curds:  yummy Wings:  1/2 salt/vinegar good but a little too salty.  Would prob just get them naked.  1/2 spicy garlic my son said were delicious.  The wings themselves were a good size and crispy. Buffalo chix salad:  decent size.  I should have gotten grilled.  Too breaded for me, but I think that's how it's supposed to be. Buffalo chips:  decent, a bit too salty with the salt/vinegar rub, but again my fault. Overall, a decent meal,  as long as I remember to stop covering everything in salt/vinegar rub!  Will be back again."}
{"text":"B Dub is hooterific.  I love me some chicken wings.  I don't care how many chickens died for my chicken eating that night, but it was a bloodbath...not literally the chicken was well cooked.  They got about 438 types of sauce, all terrific and some that burned my stomach till it hurted.  I here its a chain, but its not in SF, so I'm bummed.    4 stars for making me gain 5 lbs by eating 42 wings in an hour.  Take that Kobayashi!"}
{"text":"This location is pretty good. Like how they stay open 24 hrs now. This last time it was just me and my wife and we had just got back from vacation in Colorado. We ordered the large traditional. There was way more than we usually get. Bonus for us!! We love the salt & vinegar. Also I like to order the fried pickles."}
{"text":"Very nice place and service is excellent.  Usually come in on Tuesday's for their 45 cent wings.  Probably the best deal for wings in the city.  All the flavors are well made (Thai curry, asian zing, and spicy garlic are solid choices).  Lots of Big screens on with games (can request of a specific game).  Waiter is always checking to see if \"we're doing good?\"  Always asked us if we like a refill.  Parking is a bit tight on game days, but nothing too bad."}
{"text":"Their service is terrible. If you have the pleasure of having Kelli as your server then good luck. She made us feel like we were a burden to her so we left. There are way too many places to have a beer and watch the game with great service to have to deal with that."}
{"text":"I miss Buffalo Wild Wings! I stopped going to the one back home because service was so terrible I never came back but welcome to Vegas!   Craving something not too pricy and not too greasy and BWW just opened up so we had to stop by.   I'm simple and get the wings with medium sauce and a basket of fries. Just like 90% of the restaurants on the strip it's 24/7! And service here was awesome. She checked up on us and refilled our waters when we needed."}
{"text":"I was looking for a certain football game and I called ahead twice to make sure that they would be showing the game. They assured me that they would. So I show up with a party of 5, order 3 beers and 2 sodas and ask for my game on a tv close to us. After 20 minutes of no drinks and no game I finally get the waitresses attention. She said she was sorry with the bad service and went to get the manager about the game while she gets the drinks. The manager was extremely non helpful and said \"well it looks like we don't get that game\" and walks away, even with me telling him that I called ahead twice. We all ended up just walking out disgusted with the terrible service. AVOID THIS BWW LOCATION AT ALL COSTS!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in & waited like 10 minutes to get seated while there was many tables open.. Our server was so new, that she had to look at our menu because she didn't even know what was what.. We waited exactly 42 minutes to get just 2 entrees, a traditional & boneless combo & an appetizer sampler.. When we recieved our food, it was a nightmare. The fries were hard & cold, not even a handful. The boneless was hard as a rock, had no sauce, more like they just drizzled it over.. The vegetables were stale also. Overall, nothing was presentable. And she called one of my friends fat because she finished a whole appetizer sampler by herself.  This experience was horrible. I used to go to the Sunset location, but this made me not want to go to any location ever again."}
{"text":"I'm just not a huge fan of any of their food.  It's ok if you want to sit in the bar, watch sports, drink beer and play trivia!"}
{"text":"I've visited this location on many occasions and it seems like the more I go, the worse it gets.  Last night, we were greeted and immediately seated at a booth. The hostess was super friendly. However, our server does not belong in the food service industry. Not only did he get our order incorrect TWICE, but he wouldn't set the plates or drinks on the table. I had to physically take them from his hand and place them on the table. He literally just held it up in front of my face, like \"here, take it.\" Fast forward to the end of our meal, it came time to get our ticket. We explained to him that it would be split 2 ways. Mine (I got an appetizer) and my child's meal on one ticket, and then my friends meal (regular menu item) and drink was separate. He comes back to the table and had my child's meal separate from everybody elses, like a 10 year old is supposed to pay for their own meal?? No! I asked for his to be added to my chips and salsa tab.  So, he goes back to and makes new tickets. I literally had to write it down how we wanted it to go. My friends meal: southwest philly and water on one ticket. Then ours: chips/salsa, sweet tea, childrens chicken strips and sweet tea. So easy, but I had to write it down and draw a line thru it. So he's off again and comes back with the right tickets. My friend and I both go to pay (separate check holders, those things they put your receipts in) and he's gone for 11 minutes with our debit cards and nowhere to be seen in the restaurant. I never saw him walking around or taking food to tables, or checking on customers. He was literally gone 11 solid minutes with both of our cards.  HERE'S THE KICKER: He comes back to the table with our checks and tells us thanks and have a good night. I open my receipt holder and I was charged for a meal that wasn't mine. He ran my card for food I never received!!!! So my friend checks their receipt holder and their card was also charged inaccurately! I immediately get up and go straight to the bar to ask for a manager to meet me at my table. The manager promptly came over and I explained what happened, referenced the last 4 digits of the card on the receipts and shows our receipts had been switched, even though we placed our tickets/debit cards in separate receipt holders and mentioned he was gone with them for over 10 minutes. She profusely apologized and said she would have a talk with him. But at that point, I just wanted to leave! It is what it is, but I won't be back. The manager was sweet and understood my issue, but at that point, the cards had already been charged and the damage was done. We weren't offered a discount or anything, which I didn't really expect. I just wanted to be accurately charged for what I received. Not pay for someone else's food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Also, in the past, I've placed to go orders for pickup and told 15-20 minutes. I've arrived about 20 minutes later to get my food and had to wait upwards of 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge I'm standing there, and then another 10-15 minutes most of the time to actually get my food brought out to me when I've called it in 20 minutes prior. Seems a big ridiculous for something that shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to make. Overall, I've had multiple negative experiences at this location and will just go somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"Your prehistoric male bartender with the glasses has a bad attitude. I picked up an order and I opened up the boxes to ensure the delivery was correct. I noticed the chocolate sauce was missing for the cheesecake bites and politely requested some. The bartender insisted he placed it in there. I was double checking the sauce bag and the bartender snatches it out of my hand and rudely dumps out the entire bag on the counter. Guess what? There's no chocolate sauce. He runs back to go fetch some and still insists its in the bag and that I just don't see it. He opens up the cheesecake bites to prove to me he placed it in there and once again no sauce to be found."}
{"text":"You shouldn't type things when you are pissed off, so I'll try to be as objective as possible.   Hostess - fine, food - good, server - absolutely terrible. It was pretty simple, our server didn't do her job. I have no issues leaving great tips, but she deserved no tip. The only reason I give her a measly 15% is so I didn't end up on Reddit being shamed by society.   She didn't remove any of our appetizer plates, she didn't come to see us if our food was good or even right until the check came, the check was split wrong, didn't ask us if we needed any boxes, and my friend paid with cash didn't even get her change. It wasn't even busy, which surprised us because the 49s and Seahawks were playing.  To make matters worse when trying to flag down the on staff manager, he didn't acknowledge us and when we walked past us to another table, his eyes were bloodshot and looked completely loaded or high. We decided to cut our losses and get out while we were still \"ahead.\"  Maybe if the manager would stop flirting with his servers and teach them customer service, this place wouldn't have such bad reviews and would be more busy on a big game night. I'll be driving across town to the BBW in Savoy, which I have never had an issue with."}
{"text":"The servers were nice and welcoming and allowed me to taste test the flavours they had in their menu for the wings, the taste test were sampled with tortilla chips dipped in the sauce I requested(I give an A+ on customer service alone).   With respect to the food, I can only say it was sub-par. I was not too impressed with the wings as they were quite small in size (barely any meat in them)and they came out warm (almost it was deep fried so long ago). If I had to make a choice, I would not come back here again. They need to evaluate their wings and its quality as they're supposed to be known for their Chicken Wings - I've tasted better through different franchises to be honest. My expectations was a little bit higher. I wouldn't come back here again and would explore other options for wings."}
{"text":"Food is just okay but be careful of the servers. They will up sell you without your asking until you see the bill. Since the prices of beer aren't on the menu, they will say that unless you specify, you automatically get the largest drink. That may be a little thing, but what else aren't they being honest about."}
{"text":"This place does the minimum: from the servers to the host to the manager.   Make sure you have time whenever you come here.  The waitresses barely come around and when they do you have to ask for basic necessities when eating like plates and napkins.   And that's if they remember by the time they stop by next.    Host wiped down dirty table and threw his dirty rag on a different table where you can see food parts fly off the table.   Then sat a different group of people later without rewiping it down.   I also witnessed another server sitting on a different table while taking an order!!   Saw the manager once during our entire time.  As I eyed her down and finally made contact she turned around and went to the back.   Overall not happy and definitely not coming back.   If you are a fan of customer service than this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Just get the wings and beer.   I tried 5 flavors and my favorites were the Carribean Jerk and the Chipotle Dry Rub. The chipotle dry rub was perfectly seasoned. The carribean jerk sauce tasted great but they drowned the chicken in the sauce which lessened the crunchiness of the fried chicken. Next time, I think I'll ask them to \"go easy\" on the sauce. I also got the cole slaw and potatoes wedges on the side. The wedges were standard but simply a filler for me. As for the cole slaw, it tasted funky. I can't quite put my finger on it but something was off putting about the slaw.   I wish they had an option where you can taste just the sauce. I guess I'll ask them next time =)  I was pretty full at 10 wings (is that barbaric for a woman?).  Anyhow, I plan to come here after finals week to down some beer and chomp on some wings. It's a good spot to hang out with friends and zone out on one of their TVs!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time tonight !!!  It was my first time to dine at a Buffalo Wild Wings and now I can see why it's so crazy popular!!  The hot wings were amazing but best of all the staff was so friendly, outgoing  and welcoming !!!!  Our server Shandra was outstanding --- fun, helpful and adorable.   We cannot wait to go back !!!!"}
{"text":"I was here last night. Our service was great. Super sweet girl, great at her job but didn't catch her name. Unfortunately, my snack size Parmesan garlic wings had barely any sauce. This isn't the first time this has happened. You want extra sauce, gotta pay extra! But you pay full price and don't get enough sauce to cover your wings...pathetic."}
{"text":"Visiting vegas and i needed a quick bite in between drinks lol.. It was pretty empty and i sat near the bar the bartender was great the food was good and i all in all enjoyed myself"}
{"text":"Everyone knows what to expect from b-dubs regarding the food. The wings are the best - and that's with any b-dubs restaurant anywhere.  I've been to this location several times during the busiest of hours. Friday and Saturday night dinners while a big sports game or even the olympics were playing. What makes this my favorite one to go to is that not once have I ever had to wait for a table to open up. Sure it might take a couple minutes longer than it would if the place were empty to get your food, but it is still exceptionally quick.  The customer service here is great as well. Definitely will be coming back more often."}
{"text":"Drinks took 20 minutes, when I attempted to go up too the bar to order on my own the bartender refused to serve me because she said my waiter already had an order in for us.     Food order came out with only one item correct.  Almost finished with the correct order before the other people's food came out.     Unsatisfactory service for such a simple menu.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"I love coming here when the UNLV Runnin' Rebels are playing away games. Gather round some great wings and burgers with friends. The food really is better than you would expext everytime. Can't beat this atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I won't echo the majority of the reviews outlining the laziness and stupidity of the service staff. Like many others who submitted reviews, the service was awful, wait staff clueless and food very below average for a BWW. What I'd like to share with yelp nation is the response from the \"manager\" after I outlined a half dozen service and food errors.  First of all, it took him 10 minutes to  come over to our table after asking the hostess to find him on a night the restaurant was 20% full.  He impatiently listened to the half dozen incidents of poor service and replied \"this will be a good learning experience for the waiter\" After this two minute conversation with the meathead manager, it was obvious where the problems at this restaurant start.  For in those in yelp nation looking for wings and a sports bar in north Scottsdale look elsewhere for your own sanity."}
{"text":"The management here is completely unprofessional. We came here when there was apparently a UFC fight on (we had no idea and just wanted to watch football). We stopped and checked in with the hostess but because the fight was on all she said she could do was put our name on the list and couldn't quote us any kind of a wait time. Wow. Ok. So since the bar is usually open seating Mike tells her he's going to head over to see if there are any open tables there. He finds one and proceeds to sit down when a manager starts yelling at him that he can't sit there. He asks why (Who wouldn't?) and she tells him because he just can't.  So he walks back to the hostess where I am waiting and tells us what happened and the the hostess apologizes and tells us that only the rail at the bar is open seating. Um, thanks. Not sure why she didn't tell us that in the first place. And I'm not sure why the manager of all people just didn't say that is wasn't open seating right now and suggest that we sit at bar rail.   I can understand that things can get stressful when the place is packed and people are drinking, but that is no excuse as a manager to have a bad attitude."}
{"text":"Always down for happy hour and $.70/wings. Cierra was super sweet. We had several types of wings from the Asian Zing to spicy garlic to lemon pepper. This location isn't as busy as most BWW in the valley and is super nice to sit out on the patio when it is nice outside. Don't forget your side of ranch and late night happy hour starts at 10pm!"}
{"text":"I really love eating at Buffalo Wild Wings, but at this location their service is slow. I don't mean to be a impatient customer because I know how busy servers can be, but we waited almost 25 minutes for our food. Keep in mind we were there around 9 or 10. The place wasn't packed or full, but the server still seemed panicked."}
{"text":"I like this place.  I really only come here as a local hangout after work or late at night for their happy hours or wings specials.  Typical Buffalo Wild Wings.  The area is nice and the servers are always friendly.  You definitely know what type of food you are going to get when you come here and it doesn't usually disappoint which is nice.  The drinks are good and usually strong which is a plus in my book.  Good place to hang out late a night with friends."}
{"text":"Owner should thank his lucky stars I'm not posting a picture of my completely raw chicken I was served last night. I dont mean a little undercooked, I mean as raw as when they bought it! After the manager agreed to fix my order I got it \"to go\" (because all my friends were done eating) and this time they made sure they weren't raw by burning them to a crisp and drenching them in so much sauce it was sickening to look at. I threw them away. Manager comped my meal only, and looked more frustrated than sympathetic. I suppose this is an error with the chef,  and not so much the rest of the staff."}
{"text":"I don't typically give poor reviews as I appreciate how difficult it is to run a restaurant to everyone's liking and I know most restaurants do their very best to please, but this experience was awful.  The first impression was noticing table top accoutrements piled on the floor next to the door that led to our patio seating. The carpeted floor was dirty and certainly not a place you would want to stack items to be used by your customers. We stood at the patio for a brief second before we changed our minds to eat indoors because the patio tables were scattered and the patio felt rundown. After being seated inside the one and only highlight of the evening was our server. I believe his name was Samuel. He was very nice and did his best to give us good service but voluntarily apologized multiple times that our two dinners were taking so long to prepare. In fairness, there was a major basketball game being played that evening and the place was very crowded but still, the delay was unreasonably long. When the meals arrived, the carrots and celery were limp and a long long way from fresh.  One basket of wings appeared to have been sitting under a heat lamp for quite a while as the barbecue sauce on top had already thickened. The chicken in the other basket appeared to be freezer burned.  The appearance of the food was off putting and nothing tasted fresh. This is not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"Kilt Lifter on tap, Mango Habanero hits the spot along with Jamming Jalapeno. The first order were nice and wet the 2nd order were a bit dry. I didn't like the inconsistency. waitress is on top of her game tonight. Place is clean and presentable. TVs everywhere you look ranging from basketball, baseball, hockey, tennis, motor sports, i think I even saw skiing.  The place is chill. I would recommend coming during their wings special (Tuesday or Thursday) otherwise expect a heavy tab. The place is descent but food is nothing spectacular. A chain restaurant with plenty of TV's."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  Manager just stands around instead of helping staff.  He stayed towards the back and did not check the front for customers. Lots if empty tables and still had to wait for 30 minutes.  Other customers waited for over 40 minutes before they were seated. Was not offered a table right away and was not offered to sit at the bar. Manager did not even go around to ask if service was ok.  For a simple restaurant, manager has no excuse for poor service.  Hostess stated that servers were behind even though at least ten tables were empty.  We should have gotten a table and served us drinks while waiting."}
{"text":"I always like their wings.   The only thing that bothers is when you ask for extra wet and there is still hardly any sauce on it.  Life= Parmesan Garlic, but if they hardly put any sauce on it, what's the point of even living really.  They are nice and friendly and as long as it's not on buy one get one free bone in Tuesday's, they will load you up with sauce if you ask.   Sauce on the side bonus is always awesome too.   Last time I was there, they gave me celery instead of the carrots that I requested. I kind of wanted to burn the restaurant down but I have enough self control not to."}
{"text":"Love the Wings. Usually the service is lacking but today was different. Anthony was great, he made sure we had what we needed and took time to interact with my 3 year old daughter. I will ask for Anthony from now on. I would suggest if you expect good service at Buffalo Wild Wings to ask for Anthony!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the lent options at BWW.  Would have been nice to see a fish sandwich or at least a couple options...   We ordered the shrimp po' boy sandwich (only option) and is was fine but not great.  Our waitress was very friendly she was the reason for an extra star."}
{"text":"Wings are small and hard liked overcooked, waited 15 minutes to place order, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner with family after driving around from Westlake and Lakewood. By the time we (kind of) made an agreement on where to eat (I protested going here on account of crappy meals I've had elsewhere...the wings at a different location were dry, hard, crunchy, and to me, inedible). I caved because I was the one driving around and I was friggin hungry and sick of hearing everyone complain about where they wanted to go.    Initially our food took pretty long to come out. I can't say definitively how long, because I wasn't keeping track and it wouldn't be factual; however, the food was taking quite some time.    My mom and sister got a burger to split which looked big, and pretty substantial. They had no complaints.  My dad and I split a buffalo chicken sandwich (thinking it would be a reasonably decent size) and asked that it be cut in half. We also split the loaded nachos as an appetizer.  I hate to sound like a diva, but I have not been this disappointed and unsatisfied with a meal in a very, very long time. My complaints about the sandwich are as follows:  -The peice of meat was approximately 3.5 or 4 ounces (I work at a restaurant that serves 4 ounces of meat, so I feel I can give an accurate representation of its actual size) Which isn't horrible, but for a $9 sandwich, I was expecting a reflection of the portion of meat in relation to the price. Not a huge deal, but okay.  -When they cut the sandwich in half for us, by dad got all of the chicken party, whereas my half got a tiny little bite (not even the size of a chicken wing. I am not exaggerating) due in part to the chicken breast being so small and slightly misshapen that it didn't fill the inside of the sandwich, and when it was cut it was cut without thought.  -There was very, very little buffalo sauce on the bun. Kinda like when McDonald's throws a few drops of ketchup on your burger to one side...who eats anything like that?! Asked for more, our server gladly got us some.   -The chicken. Oh the chicken. I'm kinda glad I didn't get any chicken. That little bite I told you about that I got? Didn't even finish it. My dad was equally pissed at this point and threw a peice of his onto my plate while swearing to himself. It seemed as if it was frozen, and then microwaved. Nothing of this seemed like chicken should be. It was rubbery, somewhat flavorless, extremely dry, and just terrible. Told my mom to try a bite and she cringed and eventually spoke to a manager on behalf of us because my dad and I were so bummed out.   The nachos were not good at all. It seemed like something a drunk person would make for their buddies at 4 in the morning once they got home. Too many nachos covered in diced tomatoes, \"cheesey\" yellow queso that you would find at the store in the chip section in jars, a tiny amount of chilli scattered over top and raw jalapeno slices with a side of salsa. Tons of plain chips left over. Nine bucks.   The service here is really good. The manager handled the situation appropriately and the server was very nice as well.  The moral of this story is that I vow from this point on to never step food in another BW3s again. Truly low quality, crap food."}
{"text":"Smells bad. Insanely expensive. Crap service. Gave them 3 chances and NEVER again. Recommend avoiding."}
{"text":"The staff here never seems to know what beers are available.  Also, they    serve very few local beer.  I think their management could use some improvement.   We go occasionally for the wing night specials and the food is typical of other Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"buffalo wild wings is buffalo wild wings. they have interesting flavors for wings, their prices aren't terribly expensive but their wings are usually overcooked. i suppose i'd rather have that than undercooked wings. bww is one of those places we go to when we find ourselves hungry at 1am but don't really want to drive too far for food. just knowing what to expect when you come here is the key. it's a chain restaurant that serves its purpose and that's all i can say about that."}
{"text":"The last few times I've been to this location, the service is sub-par. Orders are incorrect, rarely ever see wait staff, drinks are always empty, even when the restaurant is not busy. Wings come out cold. I won't be visiting this restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"The food was great the service not so much. Waitress was avoiding us we waited extended periods of time for simple stuff 20 mins waitress overcharged us when i pointed it out she was rude least favorite location and we love bdubs and she was rude to my disabled son also  only gave 1 star cause food was good service was awful"}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings is a pretty standard chain.  Great selection of lunch and dinner items as well as a nice beer menu. Pretty quick service and enjoyable wait staff. As expected, tvs playing the game (or games) everywhere!!"}
{"text":"Please stay away.  A group of us went here after we decided to take a friend of ours out after he was in an accident and recovering.  Service was horrible, it took forever for the staff to sit us and then a good amount of time for our food and drinks to come out.  Even though we spent time talking amongst ourselves afterwards, it took another 20-30 min for the bill to come.  I really don't want to hear about how pregnant you are when you look 15.  I'd prefer the servers to realize they're in the service industry and up the service"}
{"text":"4 of us came into buffalo wild wings for drinks and wings. We love BWW and thought we would try this location as we were in the area.I just want to make it known that we are all servers and probably the easiest guest to please.We wanted to sit in the bar area and the first impression we got of the staff was so awkward. The \"manager\" said we didn't even look 18 jokingly. We're 28? We're short? OK whatever. We ordered 4 beers and it took kind of a long time for how slow the place was. Like 10 min. Ok No biggie. We never got any waters refilled the whole time there but thats ok. When we ordered the 24 piece wing basket the wings came out and looked different than they usually do compared to the other locations we go to. We eat 1 and they're cold. They're kind of dry and the others are over seasoned and salty as well. We tried one wing from each flavor in the basket thinking maybe the other ones will be better even if they're cold. They aren't:( We all debated whether or not to say anything bc it would be so awkward and didn't want to make a big deal about it. We all had never taken anything back before. We finally just decided that if we didn't like it we should just be honest about it and maybe it was just one of those things that could be switched out. We'll the server didn't check back with us after the food was dropped for over 15 minutes so it took awhile for us to let them know about the food. So we awkwardly sat there patiently waiting for our server hoping it wouldn't be a big deal. We were wrong. This is why this location has 1 star from us. Not because the drinks took 10 min, not because the food was cold and salty, not because the staff was unattentive. The reason was instead of just saying,\"oh, I'm sorry. Let me take these right now and get you something else.\" We know these things happen! We do it everyday at work!This is what happened. She said, \"Oh, well why don't you like them?\" We tell her. \"Well ill get you a different 24 piece to go.\" To go? We say that's ok we just want to head out. She immediately leaves and talks to the manager and the manager says well.. ill see what I can do. Ok at any restaurant we have all worked at they apologize and get you something you do want. We were extremely polite? This should have been no big deal. The server comes back, doesn't say anything to us and just puts the receipt paper on the paper and walks off upset. We were as polite as we could be I'm not sure why she was upset? We were still going to tip you!!!! We get out the cash($40) for a $31 tab and she asks us,\"so you want change?\" Uh yes please? Are servers allowed to ask if that's their tip or if we need change, how awkward. She gives us the change minus the 70 cents which was missing for some reason and walks off. We decided that this was going to be the first time ever that, we were not going to leave a tip. We're servers! Why didn't u at least try and be nice about everything? We just didn't like it and we were polite about it. What is the big deal?! At least try and make our experience with YOU good?  It doesn't stop there. We were getting in the car and we're about to pull out and the server is walking towards the car. We immediately know she's pissed about us not leaving her \"well deserved tip\". So we roll down the window. One of us left our cell phone at the table... she was coming out to bring it to us. Thats really nice she did that! But...This is what she says,\"even though you didn't tip, I did the right thing to get u your phone\"... what is going on at this location? What does that mean? Right thing by not keeping it or throwing it away?! Are we in the Twilight zone? Girl, we do this job everyday and know when things go wrong it's no big deal. Just be nice about it and fix the problem. We knew it wasn't your fault about the food. You being extremely rude to us and avoiding us because we didn't like the food?that is crazy. Do you know how many times we've done everything right and food was great but people decided to jip us and we wanted to ask them why?! But u dont do that because its unprofessional.  You were horrible! How could you think that being rude because we didn't like the food was ever ok? How did you think that everything you did was just so impeccable tonight that you had no idea why we wouldn't tip? We always tip servers 20%, we get it you get behind sometimes and it's not your fault. But do what we do and do some quality control and just be nice! That's it. Ok rant over. Don't waste your time here. And if you do, don't complain or the servers will awkwardly follow u out in the parking lot. What an awkward experience."}
{"text":"I don't want to tell you how great this place is or else you'll take my luck! 24/7 delicious wings and gambling? Yes, please! Ask Mike for his favorite mix on wing flavor. It's so good ;) plus, tues it's wings for 0.60 cents ;) love you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Please skip this place ,terrible service and my whole family got food poison, 2 servers during lunch and busy restaurant? Where is the management????? I waited 40 for my check ?really? The waiters never refill our drinks but yeah wenever she dropped the check she was like\" is $40 dollars the. I have a 50 bill and she was like \" I don't think you need change right\"\"\"\"\" unreal! No worth it!"}
{"text":"Great spot to chill, watch the game and eat some great wings! My son loves this place and his favorite lemon pepper wings are always on our order.   The variety of wings they have is unreal, so much to chose from! Carribean jerk and garlic parmesan are my favorite.   We got to try this new sampler. It has so much good, honestly could be someone's meal. Mozzarella, flatbread, hummus, mushrooms...all so good!!!"}
{"text":"Bad food and bad service.  Been here twice since the reopening and likely wont be back.  +1 star for the TVs."}
{"text":"walter g is right, the wings basically taste like sauce. but thats what they are famous for.   they  have about 20 or so different types of flavored wings, if you're someone that likes to try little samplettes of different stuff, you can get the 24 wings and get 4 different flavors of wings and split it with a friend.   i tried the carribean jerk, teriyaki, garlic parmasean, and asian spice.  if you eat 12 of their 'blazin' wings within 6 mins, you can get your picture on their wall.   i feel like i can handle my heat pretty well, so i asked the server for a sample of the blazin sauce, and i'd have to say that it is pretty spicey, but i feel like it was kind of hyped, it was expecting it to be way more spicier, so spicy where you can't taste if it is salty or flavored, its just straight spicy.  it was actually pretty good tasting, i would try maybe one wing just to say that i tried it, but i would suggest you do it after you try all the other flavors, b/c i tried blazin before everything else, and everything else didn't seem spicy afterwards since your tastebuds are pretty muched seasoned to the spiciest one first. the caribbean jerk was pretty spicy good, it was an enjoyable reasonable kinda of spicy. blazin made the top of my nose sweat a little. hahaha  garlic parmasean pretty much tastes like garlic bread but in the chicken form.   teryiaki was good b/c it was nice and sweet and made the chicken kinda caramelized. asian pretty much tasted like sweet and sour sauce but with some chili pepper.  mango jabanero wasn't as spicy as i thought it would be, it was kinda good b/c it was nice and sweet and mangoey.   the onion rings were pretty good, it comes with liek a chipotle mayo sauce, and the small size, the portion size was pretty good for what you pay for. i thought everything was resonably priced and tasted pretty good.  the restaurant is pretty big, there is no wait, and its open 24 hrs. they have tons of sports playing everywhere, we stayed after our meal was over to watch the new american gladiators on the huge projection screen (only one that has sound). other screens are on mute.   service was good, all the servers are girls in t heir 20's in football jersey type shirts. pretty quick with your requets for more water  when your mouth is on fire.   their dessert menu is not that great, we opted not to get dessert there b /c nothing sounded very tantalizing."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is one of my favorite places to grab some wings from but this location lacks quality customer service to the max. Overall, the establishment is located in the same complex as the galleria mall which makes it very convenient. The inside is clean and there is plenty of available sitting. The biggest most influential factor that makes this location terrible is the overall training of the staff.  Our server for the night was rude and did not communicate with us for the most part. When we asked to speak to the manager about her behavior and the multiple mistakes we had on our order he said \"Well you are more than welcome to leave if you're not satisfied.\" It is extremely unprofessional for a manager to treat and say these things to unsatisfied customers. His employee was being rude the entire night and failed to accurately deliver our order. I will not be coming back to this location and foremost I would advice you to not waste your time."}
{"text":"The customer service here was so disapointing ! I have been to other locations and their service is outstanding. Also they just threw our menus to us and my blue moon had the smallest dry orange ever!!"}
{"text":"I used to live just around the corner from this place and it was great!  The wings of course are amazing and the other sandwiches are also very tasty.  The free wifi was also a great perk since I am going to school online.  I would sit in the bar and the waitresses were always so friendly and patient with me since I would sit there for awhile.  They continually topped off my drink and would sit and talk if I started talking with them.  I would recommend it for everyone.  Great place to take a date since its casual, great for families since there are lots of TVs and games."}
{"text":"This place makes me sad. I'm new to Vegas from California and have never been to BWW before; therefore I was elated to learn of their AYCE wings from 11-2 lunch special. Stopped in for lunch after a midterm with the girls yesterday. The waittress Danielle S. seemed to be the only waittress in the entire restaurant (with the rest of the staff standing around socializing &doing the minimal). It took 50 mins to get our order, even though Danielle S. reassured us that it only takes 8 mins to make :O ...... We had 1.5 hours for lunch from class after the exam and we were stuck at this joint for almost 2 hours. The waittress was nice BUT DID NOT UNDERSTAND when we mentioned our time constraint. She lagged getting our orders and spent 20 mins to get the bill. Completely unacceptable to spend 2hrs for lunch. Asked for confirmation of the bill several times; did not know how to split a bill; felt the need to write \"YOUR COPY\" & \"MY COPY\" on all our receipts so we know where to sign because apparently we all do not know what merchant means. I asked another girl who did not seem preoccupy whatsover for help because we had to get back to class and she responded that there was nothing she can do and it will be a minute. THE FACT THAT WE HAD TO GET UP AND STAND BY THE REGISTERS AND WAIT TO BE RANG UP IS HORRIFIC. Rude ass employees with grade school manners. The manager was present but did not care to acknowledge the problem; simply told us to wait for our checks!!! I'm sure other locations do not treat people like this and they do not deserve your business. The one star was for the wings, the only thing that made sense."}
{"text":"Good food as with any other BWW location, but expect super slow service. Definitely don't come here if you're in a hurry! When I was here last week It look me nearly 2 hours to get through a meal by myself because the waiter would go missing for like 30-40 minutes at a time, leaving me without refills, ability to order more food, or pay my tab! Usually it's not THAT bad but the staff here never seem to be in a hurry compared to other locations. I wonder if this location is understaffed.  Although the wait staff is spotty, food comes out pretty quick after the order is put in and is always of consistent quality. They have happy hour daily from 3 to 7 pm featuring discounted drinks and $4 select appetizers! My favorite is the mozzarella sticks, but they have a handful of other choices too."}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times with my boyfriend and have only been slightly disappointed once.   Great food, and generally good service.  The food, although delicious, is generally your average bar food. The staff has been nothing but friendly every time I have gone.   Really fun atmosphere. They offer game pads that you can play on while eating/prior to your meal. It'd be great for kids. Tons of tvs everywhere showing every sport you can think of."}
{"text":"A co worker and fellow Foodie recommended this place when I was asking about wings friday night.   After being seated the waitress gave my son a game tablet that interacted with stuff going on in the restaurant. He was a happy camper while we waited for the food! Bonus because I didn't have to shell out quarters for what I think of as pointless games!   Our Waitress Kat was pretty cool! She was friendly with a little bit of attitude. She took well to the friendly teasing of my boyfriend. She answer our questions and gave her opinion on the flavors we asked about. (I am new to the \"Wing\" Craze, so I had a few) Kat was on top of her game getting us refills at just the right moment and keeping our table clutter free.   I for one LOVED my wings! I had the Asian Zing, sweet BBQ and Honey BBQ. All three  tasted terrific. I loved the sweet flavor of the chili on the Asian Zing and the BBQ flavors were right on the money! I couldn't finish all of my order so I took it home and I had them the next day. EVEN BETTER!!!!! The heat kicked up a notch sitting over night! But still in the reasonable range for my taste! I tasted my son's burger and it was okay. They have fried pickles which I had been hearing about but never tried...I didn't like them! Personal taste on that one! BUT what I really liked is that the place had a couple of girls walking around giving out samples of the sauces and of the pickles! So it was no big deal that I didn't like the pickles because it didn't cost me anything to try!! I think that is a smart move on BWW's part!  I have to be honest and say that the boyfriend wasn't as excited about his wings as I was mine. But my son devoured the parmesan Garlic wings the next day!  I will be looking to eat at BWW again real soon! Maybe next weekend!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was great. Katie F did a fantastic job- super personable. Will be coming again!"}
{"text":"Insanely crowded on the weekends esp since the leafs game was on. Wings were really small and sauces did not stand out. Service was ok, food took foreverrrr, but I love that there were tablets ready at the door for antsy customers who had to wait. The kids loved that ofc because they got to play games all night. Needs a revamp in decor, although I can't complain as there were plenty of tvs. I just moved a few minutes away so I hope to come back and try out more than just 2lbs of wings. FYI, you can order two flavor of wings per 1lb unlike a lot of wing joints. Honey garlic is always a fave, and buffalo sauce is a must. Pulled pork fries were dry and were actually wedges not fries..oh and the cheese bread is actually pizza. Great place for a few beers, but wings we're very disappointing."}
{"text":"Surprised by such a great experience at a traditional chain restaurant. Our waitress was extremely friendly and clearly loved being of service. Our wings were prepared perfectly with just the right amount of sauce as we're the wedges. We also had a kids Cheeseburger meal that was standard. For a Friday night, the wait for food wasn't too bad. The only disappointment is towards the end our waitress sort of disappeared. It took awhile for her to come back and we waited several times for refills. The check took almost 12 more minutes so we were simply tired and frustrated in the end. At would certainly come back to this location given the quality of the food and convenience."}
{"text":"It not often drive too this side of town but every year come Match Madness tradition meet some friends we drink and watch games all day. IF UNLV is in the tournament this is THE PLACE too be! It amazes me the past two years many Rebel fans come out support not just watch but vocal too. Lots of flat screens all around the bar in different sizes so watch any game on great spot.   The bar area not that big space so if its packed like aka Rebels game go early. The dining area is decent size area mostly table not many booths. The parking lot not problem in shopping mall so plenty too go around.   The food always been fan of their food especially the boneless wings and variety of sauces you can choose from my favorite is the mango sauce. Selection of draft beers is always good. It not no yard house but over 20 or more beers too choose from on tap. Something there you can enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Heat vs. Spurs game. Good thing it wasn't to packed. The service is good everyone was friendly. It's been a while since we last been here since I prefer Wing Stop but I figured I'll give it a try again.   Ordered 30 wings and honestly the change in their menu with the pricing and what not is kinda disappointing considering the fact that their quality isn't that great. It's about $1 per wing and about 10 out of the 30 wings we ordered where broken, small, and just not what we expected.   The amount of business they get for everyone who comes by to grab a beer and watch a game is already extra money they need to invest more on the menu items especially now that they charge more. Good thing I prefer Wing Stop cause I probably won't be back here for a while..."}
{"text":"If you like sports or wings (or both) this is the place to go.  TV Screens everywhere and every type of wing you could ever want.  Good selection of food with about 20 different wing flavors.  Large drink selection.  Service was OK, but didn't expect too much for this type of place.  I don't frequent the place, but it's a good stand-by if you're trying to come up with something."}
{"text":"Typical BWs....decent, fast fare.  The wings are great but beer selection is pretty lame.  The best thing about this Las Vegas Strip location is if your a football junkie and need to find a place to watch the game, here it is.  Many places on the strip charge crazy prices to reserve seats for Sunday football, but here you just show up."}
{"text":"Love BWW. The boneless hot wings are great and there are lots of flavors to choose from.  It is fairly busy when I come which is usually game nights, and the service is good. If you are looking for good wings fast, BWW may be a great choice for you."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday after 11 and had to sit in the bar area. The food was good but took almost 40 minutes to arrive after ordering. We we there over two hours and only got drinks refilled twice.   After 40 minutes when we got our food, one dish was missing, which they had to go back and make because there \"was a mixup\". The manager came over and apologized the last dish wasn't with the rest of the food, and said she would \"go yell at the kitchen\". She made no mention of our food taking 40 minutes after the waiter had said food would be out in 10-12mins.   I like BWW but will not return to this location anytime soon. Most of the food was cold by the time it came out, and the only positive is the dishes that were hot, tasted good."}
{"text":"Wings are good as usual. Service was very friendly.  However...they ALWAYS forget part of your order!  Spent $43 for wings, chips, celery. How hard is it to remember 3 items? That explains the staff turnover. We go to this location about once a month. Have never seen the same person twice.probably ran off with all the items that were supposed to go to the customer!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Food was average. Iced Tea was crap. Expensive is an understatement. The obnoxious singing waitress needs to be fired. The place smells bad and I'd definitely NOT recommend. Avoid the hassle, headache and pain. Including the financial surprise as it's a scam."}
{"text":"I like eating here mostly on the weekends. My favorite wings are the mild boneless. I recommend this spot because they are always nice and are fast at getting our food.  I also like the traditional wings as well . If you want to enjoy a nice meal come here"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome spot for a busy football Thursday night. We were greeted quickly & one of the employees found a spot for us in the bar area. The place was packed & the sole 2 girls that were the wait staff were attentive & awesome... running around like crazy. We ordered our big beers which were on special for happy hour as well as some cheese queso. For dinner we shared 4 different types of boneless wings ($0.70 each)... garlic, Cajun, teriyaki, & buffalo. Everything came out hot & delicious (this coming from someone who hasn't ate a chicken wing in 6 years). We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So bad. The food was over cooked and a salt lick. Disgustingly over salty.  The chicken was not moist, it was bombed too overcooked and tasted like cardboard, very salty cardboard.  Service was crap, in a \"I want to get home and out of here\" way.  I know Vegas is crap on the strip but this has really let the franchise down, oh and it was dirty, the bathrooms had toilet paper on the floor. Etc.  Get a manager in here. It's letting your image down, it's that bad.  Never eating a Buffalo Wild Wings again. Never. They lost and we are telling everyone. Go out of business please. Don't eat here. Just don't."}
{"text":"Came here for a work get together. By walking in, this place is a sports bar in the fullest sense of the term, with massive screens everywhere, high ceilings, scoreboards, and staff uniforms looking like sports jerseys.   I had a few appetizers and they're about what you'd expect being nothing exceptional. Most were okay, but I'd advise against the deep fried pickles as they were individually battered quarter-sized. Too much batter and very little taste from the pickles themselves.  There's a couple dozen wing flavours as you'd expect. I had the Habanero-Mango. They were legitimately very spicy and good taste. I had a couple other flavours too. The chicken itself is not likely pre-seasoned, so you're simply having fried wings and then tossed in whatever sauce or rub you ordered.  One thing I do really like about the place however is the interactive gaming. Some of the games are played on the monitors, but you receive a tablet and can choose between a number of games and play others. I love trivia and it was a fun thing to have. Great that its free-of-charge as well.  Food never rises above a '3' (sometimes dips lower), but they pulled off the atmosphere pretty well if you're looking for a busy and interactive sports bar."}
{"text":"I don't know what any of these other reviews are talking about! This place is amazing! I ALWAYS get the best service and the atmosphere is always good. Hamilton was one of the best servers yet! My glass was never empty and he always asked if we needed anything. I will always come here and enjoy the friendly staff and the enjoyable atmosphere. By the way, this place is about fun. The sports, the alcohol, the service, and the LOUD MUSIC is what makes this place like no other. If you don't like it... Stay home and bother someone else. Thank you BWW for being so amazing EVERY single time!!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best server is Chay! Always making it feel like we are at home and not a restaurant. We love the way she is so personable and really tries to remember our orders and make us feel so important! She's not just our server, she's became a really great friend! Thank you so much Chay for everything you do! B DUBS is lucky to have you!!!!"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. We came in for lunch while on break from a work conference. Keep in mind we had an hour and 15 min. Yes we did come in with a large group, about 18, but we were seperated into 2 groups.   Long story short, we are sat right away in the bar area and told by who I am assuming was a manager that the server would take care of us and get us out quickly (he knew we were on a break). Our order is taken and literally 50 min later our food comes out. We had to eat our food so fast and bolt out of there to get back in time. All of us ordered wings with the exception of one burger. A couple of us also got salads which came out at the same time as the wings, not sure why it wasn't brought out prior. Anyways, very disappointing especially since we made it pretty clear we didnt have too long and worse it was acknowledged by the manager.   I would kind of understand if they were super busy and slammed but they werent. There was no line and there were more than a handful of empty tables.   Love thier wings but I'm sure it would have tasted better if I didnt have to inhale them so fast."}
{"text":"Wow ..... this is our 3rd & last try here. I really tried to have a great time with my family but, after the long wait for our food (which was luke warm) soggy fried pickles & onion rings I couldn't take it anymore. I'm truly done, $60 wasted !! The second star was given only because someone was doing the Hot Wing Challenge while we were there. (cool to see) At least the Olympics were on !!! GO USA !!!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying the wings here are always great no matter what. I met some friends here after work one day and this place is always busy. It's what it's known for but we were taken right back to a table and greeted by a super great server. They took care of all our needs made sure our drinks were filled. Being busy I know they can't be 100 percent attentive but I asked for ranch a few times and never got it. It's cool though still a good stop for wings"}
{"text":"This restaurant is some what going downhill. Service is no where near as good as it used to be sadly. I used to really enjoy coming here and now I just have to hope that service is decent and quick, and that the food orders are correct and complete. Every time I go there now, something is forgotten when the food comes out.   This is a company wide thing but I also don't like how they changed their Tuesday specials, and now the small order or traditional wings is 9 wings instead of 10. That's pretty ridiculous to me.  Sign up for the Blazin' Rewards program if you can."}
{"text":"I've never had any issues coming here. Working in Gastonia, I'm able to frequent this location a lot during lunch. My food is usually never ready, I probably get there too soon anyway so it's ok. It's always fresh and hot. The servers working in the takeout/to-go area are always friendly and helpful and I'm also always greeted when I walk into the building.  My favorite wings are the mild, medium, teriyaki and lemon pepper wings. I love the boneless wings in both lemon pepper and bbq flavors."}
{"text":"Have the potential to be a 5 star location. If they get the right management. Everytime I go there it's something missing. Either food not cooked right, you have to hunt down an employee because there all in the back, you  have to ask for napkins otherwise I guess they expect you to whip your hands on your clothes. I've never been to this location in had an overall perfect experience or at least standard."}
{"text":"Generally when we come here, it's just ok. My husband I had lunch here today, and it was amazing! I give all the credit to Yari! She definitely went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. This young lady could definitely teach the other servers here a thing or two"}
{"text":"The service here just keeps declining and declining. I go here about once every  year now and sadly it just gets worse. I used to like coming here back in 2010 but since then the service is unacceptable.  Came in on a non busy day around 2 or 3pm to get a bite and relax at the bar and no one welcomes you. They just chat chat chat with each other and didn't offer me a drink or a menu. There was about 2 other parties of 2 at the bar so it was pretty dead.  The bartender lady came over and finally offered me a menu and a beer. I never saw her after that. She is probably one of the worst servers/ bartenders, I have ever come across. Also the food runner, brought my meal, with no ketchup, salt or silverware. I just got up and did it myself. I did follow up with the terrible bartender and let her know that I was not going to tip her because she didn't really do anything other than pour me a beer. She got very defensive so I just ended things there. I am also in the biz and I wont tolerate someone that doesn't take accountability for their lack of service. I told her manager about it who was very nice and polite. I told him I didn't want any comps at all but he has to know how bad my service was."}
{"text":"It took over 30 mins to get our cold hard food. Waitress had tables all over the restaurant so she wasn't very attentive. We had to call the manager over to get hot fresh food.   Love watching football here because of the excitement of the other patrons."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for lunch with great specials. They have a rather large bar which is excellent for those game nights. The wings are decent. I have a had better but they will do in a pinch (A little small for my liking). They have a wide array of flavors to choose from so take your time and sample them all!  The service staff are very professional and courteous. Just get bigger wings and you'll get the 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great Service, I Came To Watch The Game And Have A few Drinks, it Wasn't Crowded It Was Just Enough People, Great TV Views At The Bar Area, Will Come Back"}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had, waitress only talked to us twice in the hour I was there. Ordered wings and took a hour to come out and it wasn't busy. Talked to the manager and he did absolutely nothing for us. Will never be eating here again."}
{"text":"I love going to BWW.  $2 Stella on Thursdays and wings that are actually spicy.  Definitively worth the price.    This place has a great view of a TV from almost every seat, and there are a lot of places to sit.  I've taken clients here for lunch and I've never had a bad experience with a server.  They may not always be fast, but I've never thought they were slow."}
{"text":"Food was ok but food service is extremely slow. Waitress tried her best. Lots of people standing around maybe some should be put to work to speed things up? Btw on wing special it's only boneless wing and ranch and celery are extra - not a a deal in my world. On the plus side happy hour ends at 7!"}
{"text":"Nice service, clean restaurant,  parking can get tight especially at night, Tuesdays is wing night (60 cent per wing)!  One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place already has a bad rep and we can understand why after eating here last week. Our food took almost 45 minutes to be delivered and our waitress didn't tell us about the special BOGO they offer for wings that day when we were seated. (We had no idea!) our waitress also didn't offer us each veggies/ranch, when we each ordered wings, she only asked me if I wanted them. She also asked if I wanted another beer when I was walking back from the bathroom which was odd.... I was still working on the one I had ordered less than 5 minutes ago. Overall an odd, unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Food is as expected service was terrible. Forgot items we ordered. We didn't have silverware for our appetizer and had to ask twice for silverware with dinner. We will choose another location next time."}
{"text":"Came to pick up a phone order that I was told would take 20-25 minutes. I get here and I pay and have been waiting an additional 15 mins. The guy tells me go look over my order umm isn't part of your job to do that with me. Not have me do it.  Well I look over my wings and I'm missing about 5 wings in my large order. As he ( Ivan Perez) brings out my order he now tells me the computer went down so that's why I was waiting. Shouldn't you have told me that before. This is solely based on service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this location last week to use up a gift card and catch the game. How disappointing...  We were seated quickly, however the volume of the game was so incredibly loud that we could hardly understand what the waitress was saying. After she departed we wanted to chit chat about the menu and the game but could not without yelling. That gets tiresome. Looking around the restaurant we noticed no one else was talking either. It was extremely disappointing and not the experience I expected at a sports bar. Yes, we wanted to watch the game but we also wanted to enjoy one another's company and that could not be done with how loud the volume was. It made us eat quickly and get the heck out of there rather than sit back, watch the game, enjoy, and most importantly...spend more money.  Although the food was great and service was good, we won't be back to this BWW location."}
{"text":"D Bag hot spot. Great if you love sports on TV and a bunch of yelling men, getting drunk. I don't, but you might!  Love the fact that you can totally customize any dish with flavor."}
{"text":"What can I say... We LOVE this place!  Great wings. Great service. Great drinks. Oh yeah... AND $0.45 wing Tuesdays!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and food!  We asked the server how the new Street Corn is. \"Fantastic. I really like it.\"  So we order the Street Corn.  The server delivers it to the table. It is ice cold. So bad like it was just out of the freezer. We ask the server if it's supposed to be that cold. \"I don't know let me go ask the cook.\"  Really, I just thought you said it was great. I guess we now know she lies to make an up sale.  \"Well the Street Corn is suppose to be hot so I'll take if off the bill.\" And she walks away. No sorry, nothing from management. We ask for manager so they know what happened and first thing out of the manager's mouth is \"oh your the table with the Street Corn. I'll talk to staff.\" Again no sorry nothing. Worse service ever!  Wouldn't recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with \"good grief\".  I've been to this location twice: dined in once and chose take-out the other time. Both experiences were awful food and service wise.  When I dined in, my waitress was slow to bring drinks, take our order, bring refills, and so forth. When she brought out my mild traditional wings, it was a disaster. Half of my wings were drenched in sauce and the other half looked bare. And sad. I took a knife and sauced up my wings.  When I chose take-out, it was just as bad. I had to repeat my order several times over the phone. It's sad because I only had one order. I also ordered a Mango Lemonade (which is one of the most amazing drinks I've ever had) and when I asked what sizes they had, he said he didn't know but would give me an XL, which I didn't know existed. When I went to pick up my order, the XL drink was really a 20oz. cup. He said he didn't know that the specialty drinks only came in one size SO if you're dining in, order the Mango Lemonade and get your money's worth - for me. Anyway, I also ordered a side of celery and it was missing so I drove back because let me tell you, I love celery. The guy threw my celery in the bag and stared at me as if I ripped him off. I wish I had the time to stare back.  I walked out of BWW realizing I'd never return again. Unless they sent me the recipe for their Mango Lemonade."}
{"text":"I only get sucked into this place because my friends out number me and my Boyfriend always beats me at rock/paper/scissors. Service is mediocre never really get a server that truly engages, average food and the \"team captain\" is invisible after she writes her name on a paper and walks away. Id prefer a hole in the wall bar with excellent wings over this capitalistic chicken slinging corporation."}
{"text":"The service is getting worse & worse each time in the last 3 months. Beside the order being incorrect and never seeing your server again, lunch can be much better & $25 less at a fast food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here because my daughter loves the Buzztime trivia game. It was a lot of fun to play as a family. Service was good. We were there for Saturday lunch   I'm not a big wing person,  but there are lots of choices here. The fried pickles have good crunch from the cornmeal crust."}
{"text":"Bdubbs I love you guys But I won't eat at this location anymore, after coming in with a group of 15 I understand a server may not enjoy it in fear that she will not receive tips But when I give 25 dollars for a 10 meal and then ask for 10 back only to receive 4 dollars back from the server you can understand my frustration  Not to mention my boneless wings were so hard that it pained my braces to bite into  Guess I'll just have to eat at warm springs"}
{"text":"Good wings are hard to find in this area, but finally we have a real wing spot in the Northlake area and Tuesday and Thursday are .60 wing days....my favorite days to order takeout:-).  I usually stick to lemon pepper and they are perfectly done here but I  also love jammin jalapeno, asian zing, and spicy garlic.  I've only done take out here which is very quick and the staff is friendly and always recommend their favorites."}
{"text":"I've always liked Buffalo Wild Wings!!! But the service at this one is horrible. We were here on 10-7-2015.  We left"}
{"text":"dry rub wings were good, nachos were a waste, and beer select was minimal.  But it does have a good sports bar atmosphere, along with electronic poker and pub quiz which was fun."}
{"text":"When we came in it was great my sis in law had a table  ready for us but there was a small line .Our server Soda Pop was great a little fast past but I think it was close to closing time.He was great laugh at my brothers jokes which it's sometimes hard to find a server like this. I did witness in the bathroom at sever went and with the apron and which we all know it's a health violation. Other than that the food was great and our drinks they both came out in good time .But when we were eating they were cleaning around us which I'm not a big fan off but like I said it was closed to closing time.We asked a couple of questions to another worker which wasn't taking care of us but he was very helpful and was kind to answer our question while the server was not around.  Buenas tardes bueno el lugar estuvo bien .El mesero se porto muy bien y amable un poco de prisa como ha alaba y replicaba las cosas pero creo que ya mero cerraban.La comida salió en buen tiempo y las bebidas también. Una cosa que mire mal fue que una mesera se metió al baño con su mandil .Pero la comida estuvo bien Rico hasta los onion rings."}
{"text":"Hostess is awkward and not friendly .   We ordered jalapeños on our burgers and instead of coming to tell us they were out, she just put jabaneros on it, and didn't say anything . A mouth full of fire later I ask wtf and she says oh yeah we substitute ........ Thanks for asking me .  Additionally, neither burger had the bacon we ordered on it.   Potato salad was good but served with plastic spoons?   Garlic fries were soggy .  Food was acceptable: I would try again. Can't speak for the wings."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while and I always encounter the same problems: kitchen staff doesn't know the meaning of \"extra seasoning\" and the fries are always served cold! I'm not sure if it's because I always order pickup, but it's always a problem. Be ready to send your wings back and request more seasoning if you like them extra wet"}
{"text":"I would give this place no more than 1 star. All the employees stood around doing nothing. While 1 server took the heat. The tables around us were not cleaned. And stayed that way throughout our entire dining experience. We waited 45 mins for an app then another 30 mins for our food. The manager was nice when we explained what had happened but it was one of those \" insincere apologies\" all and all the wings were on point but that was about it."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and two of our other friends, making a party of four. We opted for the large order of 50 wings and tried to order 5 different flavors, but ended up getting only 4; honey bbq, mango habanero, garlic parmesan and desert heat. The honey bbq was pretty standard with lots of the sticky sweet glaze on the wings. The mango habanero had a similar color to the bbq but a fruity flavor that stood out and the punch of habanero and were very enjoyable. The garlic parmesan actually tasted strongly of parmesan and garlic, which made them stand out. I particularly enjoyed the contrast of the crumbly, dry outside of the desert heat when paired with the juicy chicken. The wings were overall pretty good but some were a bit on the small side.   The interior is loaded with flat screen TVs displaying a wide variety of sports and girls in bikinis while there is also a bar area that provides gaming and an assortment of various beers on tap. We were happy to find Lienenkugels on tap and order a large glass- easily enough for two to share or one happy individual to chug on.   There's a lot of appetizers that sound like yummy bar food to pair with your brew and they are open 24 hours, so I think I'll be coming here now instead of Checkers for my late-night wing fix. It's not gourmet but there's beer, boobs and chicken so who could argue?"}
{"text":"Called in to order a pick up last night. My boyfriend wanted to try some of their new flavors so he asked Jamie about certain flavors and Jamie gave his honest opinion.  We got boneless wings and they were great!! Usually, BWW doesn't put enough sauce but these were fantastic. Definitely our new favorite BWW!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a semi-busy night. The first table I sat at, I noticed the floor was filthy so I asked to move to the bar but all the tables were dirty. It was no problem because our hostess jumped into action and cleaned up the table right away. Then our server arrived and she was awesome, very nice and tentative.  As far as BWW go i say this is one of the best ones in Vegas, waaaay better than the one by the outlet malls."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with are order today. My husband called in an order to be picked up. We ordered a large bogo wings and a small bogo wings.Sauces that we wanted were spicy garlic, Parmesan garlic, teriyaki,honey BBQ,  and desert heat.  When we opened all the boxes, most of are wings had no sauce. Like seriously!!! That's messed up,  just because it's a ToGo doesn't mean to half ASS it and not put sauce.  Never ordering from this bdubs again!!! My husband said it wasn't even busy when he picked up are order."}
{"text":"Although it's pretty much brand new, it seems to be going down hill a bit because of the constant staff changes. I try to get there every couple of weeks and there seems to be an entire different staff every time!"}
{"text":"Bacon cheeseburger was the typical bar bacon cheeseburger.  I have discovered, though, as I get older, that I don't really like bars anymore.  Don't like the atmosphere, don't like the other patrons....kinda makes me sad.  So even though the food was ok, I'm sure I won't be back..."}
{"text":"Food is good, you definitely know what to expect, service can be very spotty and on sporting events, place gets very busy and service suffers during those times. Overall, food is good, reasonably priced with good ambiance and a ton of TV's."}
{"text":"*****NOT TOURIST FRIENDLY*********  Went to this place over the labor day weekend, after hitting the strip and doing what tourist do at the strip we came this place very late at night to have some wings and cold drink, i was with my sister in law and her man, it must have been after 2 am, we went in was told we can sit anywhere we wanted, this bearded guy comes up to us and with no introduction demands to see our ID, i show him mine, my wife who only had her Mexican Consulate card and shows it to him-he starts saying that this is not acceptable by their company as \"anyone can get this card\", I try to explain that this is not true and the ID clearly states her DOB, address based here in the US and shows a picture of the person, he then states that the manager would not allow  it and it is stated at the front of the door and tells us to \"LEAVE\", he keeps stating that ANYONE can get one of these, making sound that Its a black market id or in reference to!  Im like WTF! EVERY location on the strip we went to accepted it to purchase alcohol and entrance to any club we went to, went outside and looked at the front door area and theres is NOTHING that states this about this red head red bearded racist guy's claim! there is a E-Verfiy at the very top area hided by some other signs and graphics, which i was informed is used for Employment purposes only not to purchase food! I left in rage of this Idiots claim!  F U C K this Racist Place! I will be contacting all my local family that live near here and in the Los Angeles area letting them know how they treat tourist because thats exactly what we were TOURIST trying to get a late night meal! The Idiot who kicked us out for being tourist trying to get a bite is a medium build guy with red hair and a red beard! Worst of it all is I told the people i was with that night how great this place was LOL! Im NEVER going to one of these places again! DONT SUPPRT RACIST establishments like this one!"}
{"text":"I come here with friends every now and then and every time the service sucks. We always go in and wait to be seated yet the waitresses always just keep passing by  not wanting to seat us. Last night we had to wait until the manager came to seat us. After that it tool forever to get our drink orders down, and of course it took an eternity for the drinks to come. The restaurant was pretty empty too so I can't even imagine how bad the service is on a game night. Of course it took ages for our food order to be taken and for our food to get to the table which is strange to me as when I walk by the kitchen the fryer is always full of pre cooked wings. It shouldn't take an hour to spin pre cooked wings in sauce. As for the food, the wings are usually really dry, maybe because they sit for so long? Anyways I do not recommend coming to this BWW."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this rating. Have been here maybe a handful of times (last time was a couple months ago) and service has always been good. The girlfriend and I usually go at odd times just to avoid any massive crowds as we use to frequent BWW a lot while living in CA and we understand how the crowds usually work. Food is always great. This place loses a star based upon their parking situation. First time coming here we got lucky and parked right in front. Last couple times we were forced to park next door in the gas station parking area. This location has a horrible parking lot as they share it alongside a U-Haul location with trucks everywhere. When we park in the gas station lot, I am in fear my car will be towed. Doesn't make sense to build a restaurant as great as BWW and have this bad a parking lot situation. You have two options when you park near the gas station 1) walk around to the sidewalk to get to the restaurant 2) walk down/up a hill with rocks and debris everywhere. However, the parking lot situation doesn't deter me from coming back."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  For those of you that have had the opportunity to have Buffs Wings in Newton, it was hard to think it was fantastic compared to Buffs.  The price was reasonable and we ordered two flavors, medium and Honey BBQ.  Medium was not as hot as I expected.  Honey BBQ was not bad.  It actually tasted sweeter if I had a buffalo first and then a honey bbq.  Not sure why but it worked.  The fries were good and crispy.  The sauce was too much and the wings themselves were not a little bit crispy.  It doesn't taste like it was ever fried.  The skin was kind of soggy and greasy.    The server was very nice though and she was just attentive enough.    If you're at the Outlet Mall, there is a ton of food options inside the mall.  I think I would have been more satisfied with maybe panda express' orange chicken."}
{"text":"Went in to check if a soccer game was on tomorrow and every thing was first class from start to finish. The General Manger came out to talk to us himself. The staff were friendly and fast and we even saw some one do the wing challenge which had every one up on their feet. All in all. Great staff, great management great food"}
{"text":"I've always loved bdubs, mainly because of their great wing sauces and the fact that their beer is always cold and cheap. This is one of the better locations in town because it hardly ever gets packed and the servers here are lightning quick. My buddy and I usually stop by here on the way down to Rebels games because they're so fast and we're able to enjoy some wings and beer and hit the road 30-40 min later.  I recently just found out they have happy hour every day from 2 to 7 pm and then again from 10 pm to 6 am featuring $3 select appetizers and beers! My fav are the mozz sticks. Also don't forget about wing Tuesdays (60 cent traditional wings) and boneless Thursdays (60 cent boneless wings)!"}
{"text":"I will never go here again!! Not only did the waitress dump a crap load of ranch dressing all over me she ruined my brand new purse! She was not sincere with her apology, she throw a few dry napkins at me. I told them I was not going to pay but I didn't even eat I am a vegan lol.. so they comped my $10 dollar meal for my daughter!! This place sucks and just because I don't eat there I could still drink there if I decided too. I would never go here again and would not recommend it! Their service is horrible and they don't care if they dump ranch dressing all over you! I had to tell the manager that your employee is not sincere at all and I'm not paying for crap! She should have offered to buy a new purse since it's 2 days old.. The ranch dressing stained it for good!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was pretty bad. It started off ok but after our food was delivered we didn't see our waitress again until I went up and asked for our check. I feel like she forgot about us. No refills on drinks and we each were given one napkin to eat wings. I love Buffalo Wild Wings but I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"It's what you'd expect. The place is always packed and they keep the drinks flowing. The only thing notable is that they are a tad pricey and anything besides wings taste mediocre....hmm I don't know maybe it was just an off night. ..."}
{"text":"The service carries this spot higher on my rating scale.  These guys are so friendly, welcoming, and take good care of everyone.  Not my favorite food, but at any hour when hunger strikes bww does the job.  Countless nights buzzed in my party dress or cozy in my pjs... I've been here.  I feel safe. No one harasses me. Skip the local bar with the creepers and cigarette smoke! Won't deal with that here.    Grab a cushioned seat in front of the poker machine and keep the drinks comin!  It's rare I'd come here without ordering the chili queso dip.  Super thin almost papery tortilla chips. But the dip! Pretttty good.    New item on the menu today.  Street tacos.  $5.29 you get 3 small ones.  The chicken is cubed chunks not shredded.  Lighter on the pico then I would prefer.  The tangy sauce really makes it.  Had it with a side of sour cream.  It's quite filling for its size. Nice addition!"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant thinking that it would be as it normally is ....great.  Wow were we disappointed.   First, we walked in when there was about only five tables with patrons and servers having to attend to those.  We asked for a booth.  There was about 20 booths empty. The hostess tried to seat us at tables.   We wanted a booth. Her next statement floors me when she said the servers were backed up and we would be better off at a table. I chuckled. There was two servers gossiping inn in a bussing station  Three employees were just standing around.   How were they backed up?   Second,  the wings were \"jerky\". Way over cooked and dried out.   To sum it up. The owner of this restaurant is losing money by paying people who do nothing and are getting paid to do such."}
{"text":"Probably the worst wings I've ever had..and it's very hard to mess up wings. The wings were drenched in sauce and dry rub to a point where it hurts your nose. I had to run the sauce off with my napkin in order to eat it. We also ordered bacon cheese fries and they had the skinny fries which tasted like rubber. Besides the service this place would get 0 stars from me. I've been to other BWW places closer to where I live and after the experience with the food here I don't think I'll ever come back to another one."}
{"text":"The wings are nice and meaty,delicious flavor a and u can sample and one of their sauces!"}
{"text":"Went to BWW this weekend since we had a gift card. While the service was great the food was not. Flatbread was awful and the wings were just ok."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch after Christmas shopping on Saturday we've been staying away from this location because of the terrible reviews well we said is what the heck let's try it out can't be that bad! We sat in the bar section bartender/waitress was fast cheerful we ordered wings and a burger I had to Tender Burger my wife had the wings food came out quickly... hot fast ...place is clean the beer is cold lots of sports play on multiple big screens.... overall our experience was excellent....we will definitely go back again my hamburger was delicious 2 Buffalo style chicken tenders on top of my burger with blue cheese chipotle sauce on top my wife had a dry dusting on her wings ...said her were great she enjoyed them"}
{"text":"This was the worst service ever. Food. (Hamburger ) tasted like meat it was left outside.  Now I know why I don't go to BWW anywhere food and service sucks  I would never recommend BWW to anyone"}

{"text":"Came in with my adult son to have a bite to eat and a drink and watch UFC. Came in and the place was empty. We were pleasantly greeted by a waitress, I remember saying to my son how pleasant she was. AND it went completely downhill from there.   I'm assuming our waitress was new, and I get that everyone needs practice, but this tops it all. Let me tell you how it went...  So again, greeted pleasantly. My son asked if they had lemonade, waitress said yes, and my son asked if he could have a pink lemonade, and she wrote it down, said yes, and asked for my drink. I asked for Blueberry Mint Lemonade, she didn't know if they had it and wanted me to show her on the menu. I did, and even gave a back up order if they didn't... A pink lemonade like my son. Drinks come back, my son got a plain lemonade and I got my Blueberry Mint Lemonade. Although we said Pink Lemonade twice, we let it go. Strike 1.  Waitress comes to our table 3 separate times asking to take our order. we decided on 2 appetizers, as I was only staying a short bit, but my son was staying late for the UFC main fight. We ordered Chips and Queso & Fries. Chips and Queso came fairly quickly. We eat them, wondering how long are the fries going to take. Waitress comes by to see how we're doing, and we are fine. Then again, comes by, and asks to take our order. I explain we will wait to place an order for a bit until we see how we are feeling after the Chips and Queso & Fries. She appears to understand and walks away. More time goes by, we've finished our drinks and still no fries. She's comes by and I ask how long til the fries come out. Her reply was \"what fries\"? I explained I ordered them at the same time as the other item. She quickly replied that she only put in for the Chips and Queso. Which is already very clear. Strike 2. I ask if she can put in an order for them now. She agreed and walked away without asking if we wanted refills on our drinks. She does come back shortly after and refills my son's plain lemonade but no smile, no word, just straight silence and dry face even after my son says thank you. Now she wants to be pissy? Strike 3.   Someone else brings our fries. Great. Waitress comes by ever so pleasant checking to see if our fries came. Now I'm thinking her pleasantness is fake. We finish our fries, and I'm wanting to place a to-go order and walk back to the hotel. She walked by many times not stopping by to check on us. She even would cut through a skinny space between a pillar and a table and chairs to avoid walking by our booth. Finally, as I see her coming, I raise my arm full length and speak outwardly to her, \" can I get your attention?\" But she walked right by me as I spoke. My son and I were amazed that she did this. Strike 4.  We wait and wait and finally she stops by. I explain I want to place an order to-go and pay the full bill, as I'm leaving but my son is staying. I inquire about how many traditional wings come in a snack size. She answers, \"five\". Perfect, I place my order for 2 salads and a snack size of mild wings. Her response was, \"traditional or boneless?\". I repeat that I wanted traditional. I made nice, paid my bill, and waited and waited, and waited for my to-go order. Strike 5.  Get my food, and I leave. I walk the 1/4 mile back to my hotel. Notice we don't have any plastic utensils for our to-go order. Oh well, so I ask for some at my hotel. Get up to my room and pull out the salad, and both Caesar salads are dry. No dressing. No packets. No anything. Strike 6.   Highly suggest if you go here, do not let \"Ashley\" be your waitress."}
{"text":"I've been to Lake Orion, Mi and Rochester, Mi locations once each and had an excellent time at both.  I'd give 5 stars except the following experience.   This was the location in Beachwood, Ohio. Food was yummy. Service varied from ignorant to ok.   We, a friend, myself and my toddler, entered with a couple in front of us.  We stood there for several minutes. A man who appeared to be the manager returned twice to the hostess, each time having a long conversation about seating. The restaurant was basically empty. The hostess never even looked at us. Finally, during the second conversation I interrupted to say how long we'd waited and could they seat us. The hostess mumbled something about thinking we were with a group. I really hate having to get pushy to get a normal level of service.   After that the service from the waitress was acceptable.  She was definitely struggling to serve a pretty slow section. The hostess and carry out staff continued to carry on conversations instead of doing some work.  Management at this location needs to step it up with hiring. The staff was really low quality for this kind of place."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. Bar tender acted like like it was the worst day of her life, never smiled once and acts like me ordering a beer was a favor . Have to ask for a beer after the glass is empty for 10 min."}
{"text":"My son loves this place and we needed to grab some dinner. The service was great and so was the food."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner to celebrate my son's birthday (he loves BWW). We came in on a Saturday night about 4:30pm. We were seated right away. Our server Jess was amazing. Our food was exactly the way we ordered it and yummy. We had fun playing on the gaming devices they give you. At the end of our meal they brought out a piece of delicious chocolate cake with ice cream for my son. We live right up the street and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A little different location than I've seen from the others around town. Friendly staff and fast service. Was definitely pleased and happy with the help from the servers."}
{"text":"Just don't go to this BWW.  Just a warning my rating is based purely on the service I received not the food or anything else. The minute I walked in the atmosphere felt very strange. I usually go to the one on Fort Apache but this one was closer so I decided to try it out.   The hostess was incredibly unwelcoming, and later on we find out she has a really rude demeanor. So we wait, and she directs us, the usual, and we asked \"Is there a booth available?\" She responds with a bad attitude looks around doesn't make an effort to say anything but \"this is all I have.\" To be completely fair I understand that, but it was just her approach to the situation. I recommend the BWW on Fort Apache, this one has a strange atmosphere and has unsatisfying customer service.  As soon as we were approached by another rude employee, I was so uncomfortable and shocked by the amount of attitude of the employees here I just decided to walk out. This is definitely the worse BWW I've ever been to.   TL;DR horrible customer service, rude hostess, bad atmosphere, just go to another one for your own sake."}
{"text":"We visited BWW to view the UFC 207 fight. This of course means the place was packed. Atnading room only and no guaranteed seating till the fight was over but we were invited to hawk-eye the bar for a seat.  Perfect, all we needed. We found a spot near the bar to stand and camp out in front of three of the 50+ screens in the place to watch the fight. The staff handled the busy time very well, going out of their way to offer those of us stuck standing bar service even though we couldn't sit. The beer was reasonably priced for the typical bar fare. Nothing too special but I wouldn't come to a place like BWW for some obscure brew.  They also offered to bring food to us which towards the end of the UFC card, we definitely took advantage of. Other patrons stuck standing got the same treatment, being brought drinks and to-go boxes of food so they could eat while they stood. All in all handled very well for such a busy night.  We decided on a small order of Wild Boneless Wings and they were brought to us within minutes of ordering. Given it was a busy night, it's clear that the cooking staff were cranking out orders faster than normal so I wouldn't expect a 5 minute wait for food every time you visit a BWW but it was great for the fight.  The wings themselves were just okay. The wild (their second hottest flavor) packed a fair amount of heat but not much in the way of flavor. Slightly vinegary with some unseasoned deep fried chicken bites. Nothing to write home to but got the job done well for the venue.  If you're looking to watch an event and want to ensure you have a good place to see it with a staff that will take care of you, BWW is a great place to go. The food gets the job done but isn't the main thing to come here for."}
{"text":"Pretty good wings. I love mango habanero but it is SPICY! This location is most convenient for me but not exactly the best location. If you are looking for hot wings and drink, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Lousiest BWW I have ever been to!! The staff has no energy, everyone looks unhappy, I am here on a Saturday afternoon at 2:00 the place looks like a graveyard!"}
{"text":"They mess up up my order  I asked for drummies only and they did mixed them... then I ordered naked fingers and they didn't even bring them out."}
{"text":"Everyone knows Buffalo Wild Wings and what it has to offer.  Unfortunately, this location tends to have the slowest kitchen in the NE area while overcompensating with the best sports selection you can watch (get to see all the NCAA Football games, hockey packages, etc.).  Worth trying: the rubs on the wings. yummm.  Suggestion: Please put yeungling on tap and not just light!!!"}
{"text":"Won't be back to this one. Came here last thurs at around 1140pm and by the next day  we all were sick. Luckily I only ate 3 wings and had a few bathroom spells but my poor husband ate all 10 of his and the rest of mine and was sicker than a dog for 24 hours. Vomiting diarrhea and body shivers/aches. The next day I spoke with our neighbor an he said two days earlier he got the same thing after eating at this location.   It makes me sad because we love their wings but it's not worth getting sick over."}
{"text":"Went there with another couple to try it out. Walked in and it was just a big open box with a partial divider for the bar area. Screens everywhere but the music was so loud we couldn't talk across the table. Finally ordered drinks and some food. A friend ordered boneless wings buffalo style hot. They came out breaded with this dry powder on them like Cheeto dust. They were awful. My other friend had about 5 mixed drinks and he said it felt like 1. Would not go back. Went to the one in Flagstaff and it was fine."}
{"text":"Wow. What a big difference than what I had last time.  Our server was so much better than last time.  Her name is Linnea, such a sweet sweet girl, I'm hoping we get her every time we come back now. She was so nice and friendly to us, honestly can't ask for a better service than today.  She knew what she was talking about, when she wasn't sure about something she went to ask for the info for you immediately. Friendly and talkative to us, which I appreciate bc some servers couldn't care less about their customers.  I'd like to say thank you to Linnea, if you are reading this. We really appreciated your great customer service.  We came on a Saturday which I thought was gonna be busy today but since football is over, not a lot of ppl is here.   Ordered two beers and she got them for us like right away.  What a great day today.  :)... Oh and the wings were good."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE! Sat in the bar area and maybe after ten mins we asked if we can at least have water & the bartender gave us attitude like OKAY do your fucking job!  I don't understand how anyone can give them anything more than 1 star (and thats because we can't give them 0 stars)"}
{"text":"Worse service I've had at a BWW. The host I'd give 5 stars, but as for the waitress and the guy who brought our food out 1 star if not any. Our server had a issue with us asking for prices on beer. She gave us this rude hand gesture saying \"lowest is $6 highest is $9\" we asked for certain prices on certain beers and she just says \"It varies\" so we just ordered. Gf got a blue moon I got A Coors light. We ordered our food. We ordered the medium traditional w/3 sauce types: buffalo blue moon bbq and teriyaki. When they brought our food out we didn't have our buffalo. Only had the the other two. To top it off they had all our wings on 1 platter mixed together not knowing what was witch. My gf didn't want the teriyaki but we had no choice but to guess what was what. We told em about the buffalo we didn't have. He took the platter back then brought it right back and brought out 4 buffalo wings. I've never been to BWW where they bring out your wings on one platter with more than one flavor. To top it off we had maybe 5 wings on that entire platter that were bbq. Just bad. Our plan was to be there for the entire game we were watching but after the poor service we left right after the 1st qtr and went to another place to watch the game.  I'm not gonna put names of servers/waitresses because that shouldn't matter. Poor service is poor service and it reflects on just the individual but the entire staff"}
{"text":"5PM is not only Happy Hour, but it's children's hour.  Have a beer and bring your small children.  At least, that's my impression of the place.  The noise level is typically such that an excited kid or crying baby doesn't bother anybody.    That's not to say it's a bad environment.  In fact, it's just the opposite.  It's a standard for watching a Thursday NFL Network game, a Brewers game airing on some obscure semi-private regional cable sports network, or bringing a couple of friends to play video trivia.  The 472* television screens make it possible to watch a lot of things at once glance.    The food?  It's certainly not gourmet, but it's good and it's inexpensive.  The wraps are a favorite of mine, and of course you can't go wrong with Wing Tuesdays or Boneless Thursdays.  The hot sauces offer a lot of taste with the heat, and my observation is if you're picky about your heat, go one level lower than you get elsewhere.  In other words, their \"Medium\" would qualify as \"Hot\" most other places.    The service has always been good for me here.  Some nights the food appears within just a few short minutes.  Even on nights I have had sub-par service, they have gone out of their way to make it right.    It's a good mix of sports bar and family restaurant.  It's a good choice no matter the occasion, and the solid menu offerings make it a tasty outing.    *Completely inaccurate guess.  Let's just say there's a lot of televisions."}
{"text":"One of the most frustrating nights at BWW for myself. Came in at midnight to order to go. Sat at the bar since dining was closed. Took the bartender 15 mins to even noticed I sat at the bar. Not busy per say but there's a few people at the bar. Once I finally got noticed my order was place. Simple 10 piece but took 30 mins to get the food. Never asked his name and he never gave it but they need to improve there customer service skills."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner snack (around 10pm).  I was not impressed. I've been to many BWW and have experience great service. I have no idea if it was because it was late and they were tired or they just didn't care...  My date and I walked in and there was no one around to greet us. We didn't want to seat ourselves so waited a good few minutes before someone popped his head up to greet us. He was sitting in a booth... watching the game on the giant screen. Um, what the heck? That really irritated me.   We put in our orders, got the food and started eating. Then, they started vacuuming! It wasn't super loud or super close to our booth but I was annoyed. Totally ruined the whole experience.  I most likely will only go back to this BWW if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Super awesome servers great service. I used to work at this location and everyone is super nice here highly recommended for beers with friends. Food is just okay reflected by the price."}
{"text":"This location doesn't deserve a star but how else could I write this review. I placed a to go order at 9:24pm and she told me it would be 20 mins because I ordered extra crispy wings. I walked in a little after 9:30 to pay.  Wait some more...The host comes back to the front after a while and I asked her how much longer because it's been over 20 mins. She disappears again.  By this time one of the captains comes up and says my food should be out shortly. I said how long because it's almost 10:00 and I was getting irritated and it doesn't take this long to fry chicken. I said if my isn't out by 10 bring the manager so I can get a refund. The manager finally walks out with my food and I'm explaining to him the situation and he said we wanted to make sure your order was right. I said she told me 20 mins and I'm here 20 mins after the time she said it was gonna be ready. I said it doesn't take 40 mins to fry chicken. The manager then says do you want this food or not. Wow!  Really??!! Is this how we talk to a paying customer.  I took my food and told him to have a good night because I was in shocked he asked me that. He didn't try to fix the situation or apologize. Nothing!  If these are the people you want running your business you don't have to worry about me spending my money here again.  I will notifying corporate of this nonsense.  To top it off my order wasn't right. Thank you for wasting my time."}
{"text":"Never have I ever had to wait over an hour for wings & French fries. My order consisted of 18 boneless hot wings & 8 boneless spicy garlic wings along with 2 orders of fries. Meal came out over a half hour later all bone after I was VERY specific to waitress about boneless. I then proceeded to wait ANOTHER half an hour for boneless wings AS THEY WERE TRYING TO THROW IN THE SAME FRIES THEY BAGGED FOR ME NOW GOING ON AN HOUR AGO. The manager came out & said they would make new fries & proceeded to ask if I wanted a soft drink, no discount-nothing. After the fries came out with the rest of the order there was still no celery or carrots to go with both orders after being on the menu as coming along with the food. I ask for them & the reply I received was a shitty \"oh you want those?\" Please, Stop me if I'm incorrect but don't they come with the order? It was only after my complaining (which I usually DO NOT do & have never has to do over WINGS & FRIES) did I get my full refund only to take the shitty food home with me. Never again, I'll stick to Quaker steak."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is subpar. Colby at the bar is awesome, but while the other servers are nice the service is unbelievably slow, every time, without fail. I still frequent this bar because I can't stay away from the mango habanero wings, but they really need to work on the service side of things.   Also, takeout is a no go. I've ordered food to go a few times and every time something is wrong. For instance, I ordered takeout two nights ago  and my husband's chicken fingers came out plain but were supposed to be mild. We also ordered mini corn dogs with regular mustard instead of the honey mustard but that came out wrong as well. Always check your food before you leave the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I usually come with coworkers after work and just eat at the bar. There's this certain bartender whos AMAZING! He as a full beard and is buff, I don't know his name but he's the best! He talks to us and is always attentive with us. But last night we sat in a regular table by the bar. We got the WORST server, I don't know his name but he was black and bald. We sat down and and he popped up and didn't even say hi. He just said \"ID's PLEASE!\" Well hi to you too buddy. We were indecisive and told him to give us more time, but as every time he'd stop by to see if we were ready, we'd say no and he''d walk off frustrated. Then finally one of my coworkers wanted to order a burger. He says, \"Im just letting you know the meat is frozen and the burgers don't taste good.\" Uhhhh okay? So then we asked for more time, again, he got more frustrated. Then a friend showed up and she forgot her ID. So he got even more defensive saying she needs to go. BLAH BLAH. At that point I asked for the check since I had ordered an appetizer and left him a dollar. Sounds petty, but I work in the service industry too, I don't know how you make money with that stink ass attitude."}
{"text":"Well this place was bad even for a BWW!    I am a frequent patron of BWWs all over the country, I simply love the wings so know have a pretty good idea of what normally to expect   This location however just fell flat, the service was horribly slow the staff apparently have never worked in a BWW before because they had no idea how to speak up and at their guest when it is the typical a roar of noise in these places  The waiter who brought us our food was rude reached across the table and people.    We had empty glasses waiting to order  The carrots and celery sticks were server with pools of water I. The bottom of the container   My wife's burger was cold   The list just goes on.    To top it all off we happen to flag the manager down and had to ask for our waitress and he could have taken that opportunity then to check In with us but didn't"}
{"text":"Not the best neighborhood. But the Buffalo Wild Wings by my house is closed for repairs. I love the house sampler it comes with wings, onion rings, nachos, & mozzarella sticks. Also you can download the app to get rewards."}
{"text":"I have died and gone to heaven. This place is a total dream for me. Televisions EVERYWHERE (including outside) playing different sporting events and juicy, meaty wings. Sure the service isn't all that great but with a ball game on and a beer in your hand you can't really go wrong. This place totally fills up for ASU games so get there early. It's a great environment to hang out and watch a game!"}
{"text":"I feel like I gave this place way too much credit. Since the first time going in the service has been pretty lackluster. Yesterday we had to ask for things three or four times until we got them and it took our food forever to arrive. Maybe I need to sit at the bar every time to have as good of an experience as I did the first time. I'm kind of disappointed.  A general note to the managers on duty: I see you all walking around all high and mighty in your blue button-up shirts. Maybe you should actually go up to tables and see how their experience is. Just a thought."}
{"text":"It's just like every other Buffalo Wild Wings I've gone to across the country. The food is good, service is decent. I typically will go for a sporting event or meeting up with friends for a beer. Their beer specials are pretty good."}
{"text":"I love the wings at Buffalo Wild Wings but this particular location is terrible! The wings tasted like day old leftovers, the service was bad, and the management was the worst. Corporate really needs to look into that location because something is obviously wrong with the way it is being ran."}
{"text":"Our service this time was not what it used to be.... I'm sorry to say.  I love BWW! But for the price of the food,  I've had much better service else ware.  This location has been closed once before.  =/"}
{"text":"BW'S is a family favorite. That's not just a slogan. My kids are Gluten free and there are not a whole lot of places I can take them for dinner.  They can eat the chicken wings no sauce and we are all addicted to their fries.  I know Gail the owner. She used to have a play kitchen in her restaurant for the kids but unfortunately corporate made her remove it. She tries to create an atmosphere where parents can bring their kids and they don't have to stress out about making them behave like 70 year old ladies. It makes it a little more relaxing for us.  And besides the food I love being able to watch sports while I'm with my family. Good Stuff, Thanks Gail"}
{"text":"First and foremost, I hate leaving bad review to an establishment but I think this needs to be address. I've gone to this location 4-5 times now and last night's (12/20/16) experience was horrible. I ordered the large wing selection which comes with 20 wings. I have been craving for wings so decided to get that. While I was eating I noticed that some of the wings still has plenty of feathers. They did not even bother removing it while it is still in the kitchen. Needless to say after I saw that I lost my appetite and I just paid my bill and left.   I myself work in the industry but I don't serve food like that. During prep my team do quality control of our supply to make sure that everyone that comes to our establishment is happy with their experience."}
{"text":"What happened to good customer service all these stand in imposters ask for a manager here comes a friend cold fries and wings that are like rubber and salty he standing around feet planted like he a female over there with she she she looking like he he i am  scared to eat at this point fingers pop necks roll is Mecklenburg police coming this establishment is gone to shit"}
{"text":"We received fast and friendly service! However this review is based on my food. I've been to dozens of BWWs and this was by far the worst food I've had at one. I ordered a Buffalo Chicken wrap and there was hardly any chicken in it. The chicken also tasted old and stale. The cheese fries came out cold and I couldn't even get one out they were so stuck together. It was like they were microwaved. They were also stale and cold. They brought me a new batch that were hot but this time the fries were so salted I couldn't even eat them! Worse cheese fries experience ever!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent the Buffalo Wild Wings on Litchfield and Bell and never had a bad experience.  Whether it was fight night on a Saturday evening or a lazy Tuesday dinner, I never was worried about the overall experience at that location.  This location, on the other hand, could take some hints from there now defunct location to the west.  I have been to this location 4 times with each visit hoping the previous one was a fluke.  I always would get their flagship item as well, wings.  I like the spicy garlic which I find as the best balance between flavor and heat.  Each time the chicken was either overcooked, under sauced, or both.  Why can't they do their staple item right each and every time?  Major disappointment, times 4.  I won't elaborate on the other shortcomings of this location because they are too many.  The bullet points are that the service is very lackadaisical with anything.  You sit down waiting longer for the service to take your order than it takes to get it out to you.  On multiple occasions a buddy of mine who I went with each time felt compelled to recite Reservoir Dogs lines when it came to drink refills.  They were few and far between.  Finally, I don't sit at the bar because I like to speak with the company I am in, but that was virtually impossible.  This wasn't just on event nights either.  The volume of the speakers didn't vary anytime, not even in the middle of the week during lunch.  I want a good Buffalo Wild Wings in my area badly.  I have to travel to get to this location and would happily if they delivered on what I was used to.  I guess I am off to find another of the few that are actually still open until I see this location pick up its game."}
{"text":"Nice happy hour deals, but I like to sit at the bar and watch a game and to get served there is nearly impossible! Every time I've been here the same female bartender fails to acknowledge me for 10 minutes and then fails to acknowledge me for another 30 minutes after I received my first beer. Good food but horrible service."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice, and both times dealt with horrible service. Not only were our servers apathetic and ignorant of the menu; they were both unapologetically rude. She messed up almost all of our orders, and didn't even seem to care. I am usually very carefree when I go out to a sports bar, but it was starting to seriously annoy me. It's too bad, because the other BWW I used to go to in the north valley always had great service. But, this location needs serious employee \"restructuring.\""}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars! I'm beginning to think they should not have reopened this location. It used to be a fan place to go hand out and have a few beers. But unfortunately, the last time we had a decent experience there was about a year ago. Each time we go, the service gets worse and worse, and I foolishly keep returning, hoping they'll get it together. They can't handle the simplest tasks. I order essentially the same thing each time: chicken tenders \"spun\" in medium sauce with a side of ranch dressing. Yet, they cannot seem to get this order right - EVER! The last visit, last Saturday evening was our final trip. First of all, we arrived during the tail end of a March Madness basketball game and seated ourselves in the bar area at the far end - roughly 10 feet from where all of the servers have to come to pick up their tables' drinks. A good ten minutes went by before a server came by and said she'd be with us shortly. She came back, wiped the dirty table, and took our drink order. Several minutes passed before our drinks were brought to us followed by about another 10 minutes before our food order was taken - she was not on top of it at all. I ordered my staple order and asked for two sides of ranch dressing. She noted it. When our food finally came, my chicken tender plate had some spicy ranch dip crap, AND there was only one. Wrong dip, wrong quantity... So I told the server who brought the food, who was not ours. She flitted off and never returned. I sat, and waited, as my chicken strips got cold.... At least another 10 minutes went by before our server came by, at which point I informed her of the error and the lack of follow-up. She assured me that she would go into the kitchen and get the ranch herself. She did not. I could see the kitchen entry from our seats. At least another 5 minutes went by before she checked on our table again. And then she had the nerve to tell me again that she'd go to the kitchen. Finally the woman who brought our food came back with the ranch.... My food was cold, and my husband had finished his meal (I insisted he eat as soon as it came, not thinking it would be 15 minutes plus before my ranch got to the table.) So, I had eaten my onion rings without ranch and my chicken strips were cold. I asked for a manager, who responded to the table immediately. She offered to remake my cold food, which I pointed out would require me waiting longer.... So she offered to discount our meal (WITHOUT apologizing), which I accepted. When the bill came, which totaled over $30, they had discounted it by a mere $2.71, which frankly was a big slap in the face. There is a $5 off coupon on the receipt for your feedback for crying out loud, and they couldn't even offer that much off my cold, unsatisfying meal. I will not be back because the service is terrible, and the management is incompetent. AND to top it all off, there was an incredibly stinky homeless man who was allowed to hang out in the entryway with all of this \"property\" during our entire visit. No one asked him to leave or did anything. As a woman who is 8 months pregnant, the smell was almost enough to make me vomit, which would have been the icing on the cake for this visit. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"They need to really clean their high chairs and tables they are really sticky!!!  Average food and service."}
{"text":"Nice spot for a beer seems u away from the hustle and bustle of the strip Service seemed really slow at the time we went for a late lunch but overall it was good at its best."}
{"text":"I always manage to spend more money here than I anticipate.  I usually try to hit them up on Tuesdays or Thursdays to get their special pricing on bone-in & boneless wings.  I simply order too much food every time.  With all the different options for sauces/dry rubs, it's hard to stick to only a few.  I routinely order the sweet BBQ, parmesan garlic, chipotle, asian zing, desert heat, carribean jerk, thai curry & lemon pepper.  Add a couple rounds of beer, bleu cheese, celery, plus tip & you are looking at an $80+ tab easy.  Damn!  So much for a cheap meal of chicken wings.  This place use to be better years ago.  Maybe I'm just burnt out on it or I over do it?  I use to consider them 4 star, but through the years they have managed to lose one.    FYI...the blazin' sauce is inedible.  Only order it if you have company/relatives you don't like joining  you.  It will be an experience they will not forget.  =)"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places I got to since it's open late. The past few times I've been here the wings have been overlooked and too salty"}
{"text":"BWW is suppose to be a sports bar, but they play their music very loud like you would have at a wild night club at midnight. The food and service is pretty much pretty good, and the Captains are in general friendly, with the exception for Becca she's a mouthy jerk. Me personally BWW having Captains is a joke, all they really do is interrupt the customers socializing and does nothing they promise.  We've been going to this BWW since they opened, but the past 2-3 months a few of the Captains crank the music so loud that we have had to put ear plugs in. Yesterday once again when we showed up about 4:45 pm there was about 10 customers in the place. The music was rocking stupid loud Becca mentioned she's the (joke) Captain and she's there to make our stay pleasant. I asked her to please turn down the music, she replied she'll think about it but never did. When our server showed up I asked him to please turn down the music in the dinning area, he did. But after about 30 minutes of pleasant dinning, Becca decided to be a jerk again and cranked the music even louder than it was before. We quickly finished our drinks and left about one hour earlier than we normally do. We dine out 7 days a week at a different establishment, NEVER  none of the other places is this rude with loud music. A few of the employees at BWW Metro have absolutey NO respect for the customers and do what they want. We've been there when they crank up the music so loud that young children start crying making it misurable for other customers.  If it wasn't for the ignorance with the excessive loud music in a so called sports bar and the few jerk employees we have had to deal with, I would have given more stars. But after our experience last night compliments from a mouthy jerk Becca ruining our evening with excessively loud music 2 stars was actually to many.  A few of these ignorant young people at BWW just doesn't seem to comprehend if you loose customers you won't make money. We survived many years without BWW Metro, and I'm pretty sure we'll do just fine at Native, Hooters, Chill's, Fajitas just to name a few in this area that we go to where we don't have to deal with ignorance with stupid loud music and ignorant captains. I did talk to Peter today (the big manager over several BWW) he appears to be ok with the loud music, we're not. IMO can the Captains idea and put them to work as servers actually taking care of the customers. The Captains do NOTHING when it comes to serving the customers with food and drink when the servers are not available. One good thing I'm not the only one doing a review on this place complaining about the stupid loud music."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a coworker. I'm not a huge fan of Buffalo Wild Wings on a good day, so you can keep that in mind.   We were greeted by the hostess, who I won't name to be kind. But she looked disheveled and like she had barely rolled out of bed. Ok, that could be a poor fashion choice, but when she sat us at our table and was explaining the specials she sniffled and was aggressively rubbing her running nose. She then went back to serve us our ice waters and didn't wash her hands. Blek!!  Bethany, our waitress came and took care of getting us fresh drinks. She was upbeat and friendly. Answered questions about the menu with no problem. We enjoyed her despite mediocre food and a nasty coworker. Another coworker brought our food out and when we asked for another plate she went to the next booth, where Bethany was clearing, to tell her we wanted an extra plate. She then stood there watching Bethany and doing nothing to assist us or her.   I'd say I'm disappointed, but my expectations were so low walking in it's just \"meh\".  Don't go unless you want less than enthusiastic staff and a possible side of influenza, courtesy of the hostess and her lack of hand washing and common sense."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to take our chances and test our luck to see if we could get a table for the super bowl. It was packed but the wait list wasn't too bad, compared to a 5 page waitlist at Carolina Ale House. After a very long wait, a nice lady came uo to my friend and asked if we would like to sit at her table with her friend and her friend's teenagers. If course we said yes. She was so nice. I ordered my usual honey bbq wings and potato wedges. Despite the huge crowd, they were cranking the food out. My only complaint was I had to send my Moscow mule back. Yep BW3's has a moscow mule but it\"s served in a glass mug and not the traditional copper mug. It's not that great, the bartender put way toi much vodka in it and smidge of ginger beer and yhe ginger beer is what really makes the drink. Anyway I got a black berry cooler and it was pretty good and not too sweet.   The atmosphere was electric cheering on our Panthrrs in the Super Bowl."}
{"text":"Went there to watch the UFC fight and the service was horrible!  First they told me they couldn't turn the channel of the TV in front of me because some punk was watching the Yankees game. Then it took an hour to get our food ! And they were dead !"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this has been my favorite visit and we are becoming regulars. We tried the cheese curds and oh my gosh they were so good. My hubby and split wings and they were so good. Tiffany was our server and she was EXCELLLENT! She went above and beyond on service. She deserves a gold star."}
{"text":"Everytime I've come here, it's been fast and friendly service and good wings..I can't complain. It's never too crowded here except on super bowl Sunday of course ;) I usually come for boneless wing thursdays and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I LOVE me some BWW food. But it is hard to justify the service and price here. I've never been able to get in and out when I dine alone, they take FOREVER. I e tried ordering online and by phone. You end up having to wait for 10+ minutes once you arrive anyway, whether you are early or late. I just don't get it. Last time I came it was 4:00 in the afternoon and there about 5 tables occupied but 8 that hadn't been cleaned or bussed. Seriously what are these employees doing? I don't blame them, management clearly doesn't train very well and doesn't seem to care at all about basic restaurant standards. Overall, it's a shame because I love the food, I would eat there 3-4 times per week if they could just run a DECENT operation. Come on guys, get it together!!!"}
{"text":"Classic delicious wings. Beer specials for happy hour. Friendly bartenders/waiters that sing to you and their coworkers, and FOOTBALL/any other sport you could imagine on their numerous big screens around the bar. I hope you have a ride home after your awesome sports outing, because you should stay a while!"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. After frequenting B Dubs in multiple cities and states, this was by far the worst. Appetizers came out w the entrees, forgotten sauces, missing meals ... Ugh. We ordered Strawberry Coronitas for our drinks and were told they were out of Coronitas so the beer was just poured in. Am I crazy to think that I'm getting less beer than I'm paying for this way?! I might be a lush but I'm a cost-conscious lush.   So ... The manager visited our table and tried to smooth things over, he didn't. He also forgot the sauce we have been waiting for ...   I guess we are still waiting for good service too ...  The end."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like wings? New wing place in the hood - I'm on it!  Came on Tuesday when they have 60 cent wings.  You can try a new sauce with every 5 wings which is nice.   Good: Wings, onion rings, margarita, really friendly attentive service.  Bad: Too noisy with tv and conversation bouncing off ceilings and walls and some dude announcing some wing eating contest.  Even waitress heard my order wrong.  Portion size of sides stingy.  $5 for a side of potatoe wedges.  Got a small serving that barely 3/4 filled the Taco Bell sized paper plate it came in.  Some of the wings were temperature hot, some warm, some lukewarm.  Not sure how they managed that.  One of the managers came by to ask if we were good.  Told him our order was almost right (we got honey BBQ instead of chipotle BBQ for one of our wing flavours.  He asks if we wanted to try the chipotle so of course we said yes!  He asked if we wanted some blue cheese dip as well so we said sure!  Waitress brings out the blue cheese and a paper tray with approximately a tablespoon of the chipotle seasoning.  You've got to be kidding me.  That's how I can try the chipotle BBQ? Wow don't do me any favours!  Got the bill and they charged for the blue cheese too.  Nowhere on the menu is there a price listed for blue cheese dip.  Classless act for a new resto In my opinion.  Will likely try again to see if it improves.  The Wingery  is still the best in Oakville..."}
{"text":"Seriously, when I got to Buffalo Wild Wings almost at the end of the first quarter of the season opener, I was on bar number three. The first bar didn't have NFL Sunday Ticket so I could only watch the browns. The second bar was so packed that there wasn't anywhere to go and no servers offered any help or drinks, so we bailed. Finally, Buffalo peeps flailing around in Cleveland, we remembered that there was a new Buffalo Wild Wings where that terrible dance club/bar that was always empty used to be.  Wild Wings was expectedly crowded, but there was room to stand in the bar area and we eventually got a table. They have tons of TVs and we were able to easily watch the Browns put up a good fight, the Bills pull out a win, and Miami make Tom Brady cry.  This is a pretty standard Wild Wings. The food we ordered was fine and our waitress was great. They were even raffling off a Browns jersey. Our waitress joked that she wasn't sure whether to offer the free tickets to the Pittsburgh table (they were playing the Browns) so I suggested that she tell them that after the Browns beat them, they could use the jersey to wipe away their tears... Too bad Pittsburgh stole the win on a drive in the final seconds of the game.  Overall, definitely a good place to watch the games on Sunday. Sad that the places closer to me aren't good choices, but I'll drive up here to watch."}
{"text":"Standard BW3 fare, great TVs and massive wall of projector screens with HD projectors (this place is newer than most other BW3 locations) but we found out that all drink specials cease to exist during game time. ARE YOU KIDDING? Hello? management? What kind of jerk says to them self \"oh, people want to come here to see the game so let's make sure all of our prices on food and drinks are as high as they can be\"? I think customers should be rewarded for their patronage, and there should always be drink specials during sporting events to keep people happy. It's friggin retail 101."}
{"text":"Been coming here for yrs and this place was good then bad then good again but this time was a bust. How are you going to have tables and booths open and tell me I have to wait 10 mins? All because your servers need to catch up? So sit me down and tell me it might be a little because of that reason. Don't have me stand in front of the entrance as if you guys were full. Whoever thought if that idea was thinking about themselves and not the customer.. food was great and fast as always"}
{"text":"Great burger and wings as always! But customer service could have been better.. I had to wait a while for the food and my beer but otherwise than that good"}
{"text":"So we get to this location and put our name down for seating. We get there (3 of us) and we are waiting our turn to be seated because it was packed this evening due to the hockey game. We must have waited 15 mins. Then a group of 5 walks in and puts their name down. 2 mins goes by and they got called to be seated.   I approached the lady at he front and asked her why they got sat before we did when they just walked in. She said sorry that her manager told  her that since it was a table for 5 that they might as well sit the party of 5.  Told her that not really fair for he piled that has been waiting. She said sorry and that manager made the decision."}
{"text":"I'm kind of surprised this place has such negative reviews.  I came here on a Saturday afternoon.  The place was pretty empty, and we opted to sit outside.  We were the only table out there.  But service was QUICK.  Our waiter (I think his name was David?) was super friendly and checked on us frequently.  We sat down and ordered the spicy garlic and asian ginger something, then I went to the restroom and when I came back, David was on his way bringing us our wings already!  The wings were delicious, crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and the spicy garlic sauce was amazing!  We didn't really like the asian ginger something sauce, but it wasn't a big deal since we got our sauces on the side.  In the middle of our meal, a \"captain\" came out to check on us and change TVs for us, he was pretty awesome too.    Overall we had a great experience and will definitely be back the next time we're at East Town Mall."}
{"text":"Is management even paying attention to these reviews? Looks like I am not the first one to come in here and wait 10 minutes to be greeted. It also looks like I'm not the only one to see a filthy restaurant. This place needs to be on Dirty Dining. How are they passing health inspection with this filth? After watching about 12 employees run all around the front of the house doing little work, I finally asked for the manager. About 5 minutes later she decided to come up and talk to me. Wow - so much for a good experience just trying to order $40 worth of wings to go. If I was managing this place, I would certainly be paying attention to this site."}
{"text":"BWW has grown on me over time. The wings here are pretty decent. The other food is whatever. I would just stick to the wings. Alot of flavors to choose from. I do recommend the garlic mushrooms though. They are really good and I could probably just fill up on those if I could. I also do get the honey bbq flavor. That is probably my favorite from BWW. I've tried other flavors but I don't think any really compare to that. I'm not really a big spicy person either. Plenty of big screens to watch sports on but I don't really come here for sports. It can get really busy when a big game is on or any game for that matter.   The service is pretty much a hit or miss here. You either get good or bad service and I have gotten both here at this location. This place is near where I work and it is definitely a good place to grab lunch. They have good lunch specials going on. I do also like that if you do have a late night wing craving you can go to BWW."}
{"text":"I like this place and usually get their wings - of course. I get the Asian Zing sauce with the wings.   My bartenders or wait staff are usually helpful and friendly. Lots of tv's to catch your team's games . Pretty good choice of beer.   They also have a good Hickory pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Location is great but the service and food was not. Service was slow. I got boneless wings (M) which they drenched with sauce. So much that I had to wipe the pieces off with napkins. My sister got a wrap which looked bomb. Spent $30-40. Was it worth it? Nah. Will I come back? Probably."}
{"text":"WARNING: Double check your credit card statement  if you put down a written tip. They over charged me more than what I wrote down. My credit card company credited me the difference, but I am not sure if they brought it up to this restaurant. This is completely unethical and illegal!    The young greeter was friendly and was very helpful with introducing the menu to us. He let us choose some sauces to try out before we ordered - which I thought was very nice! He brought them out and we tried them with some tortilla chips.  The Kickin' Honey Garlic wings were just okay, nothing amazing, I've had much better wings and from many different places. I would say their sauce was better than the actual chicken wing. Pricing is pretty standard, however, overpriced since I didn't think they were that good.  I also had the Big Jack Daddy Burger - this was surprisingly much better than the wings. The burger meat, pulled pork and the BBQ sauce were an amazing combo. I definitely recommend this burger over the wings.  I would not come back here solely for the fact that they overcharged me on my credit card behind my back, and I will not support this illegal behavior. Makes you wonder how many other people's money they have stolen."}
{"text":"Went to this location today at about 1pm and sat in the bar area. We had the most amazing server I've had at a Buffalo Wild Wings ever. Her name was Courtney, she made our experience amazing! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Lyndsey was awesome!  Came in with my daughter on our way to Scottsdale mall.Geat service, very fast and she was super sweet. Keep up the great service and we will def be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! I am a chicken wing kinda gal... I don't come here often, but when I do I always forget how spicy the mango habanero flavor is... I love the taste but too spicy where I can't enjoy my food! I really need to stop ordering that. But I went with my son this time and he recommended the appetizer chicken nachos... OMG! Sooooo good! I will definitely order those again when ever I go back! You also can't go wrong on the drinks here."}
{"text":"We came here to watch a game the other day and I have to say, I was disappointed in my experience. The food wasn't very good. I ordered boneless wings because it was wing Thursday and they had hardly any sauce on them. One side had no sauce and the other side had little sauce. A friend got some traditional wings and his were soaked in sauce. I don't understand why mine didn't get fully sauced like his. I didn't even bother waiting to tell my waitress because it was already taking her 20-30 minutes to check on us if we needed a refill or anything. We were all getting really frustrated with the service so we just gave up ordering anything else and got ready to leave."}
{"text":"They won't give you your order when it's placed half hour BEFORE they close and says pickup time at 12. Arrive to restaurant at 11:57, doors locked, called to get in and he rudest woman says we will not be getting our order and its on their time and policy to \"close\" before their hours even on the door say 12:00.  The corporate website says 1 am, the actual building says 12. Even still you idiot, the order was placed well before close,  so you are LOSING out on business, I don't think corporate would like that very much. What a fucking joke. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Every time we go to BWW we get the same things. I get traditional medium wings and garlic Parmesan traditional wings and my husband eats something stupid hot like Caribbean jerk or fire traditional that I can't even smell without having to drink water. Typically we love our usual order and may only need extra sauce.  When we ate here on Thursday we mixed it up and tried to enjoy the boneless wings since they are discounted but they were overly breaded and lacked flavor. We had the same problem years ago and we just stopped ordering them. The service was good and our usual stuff was good but I wish we didn't add the boneless. Note to self, stick to what you know and don't venture away from your favs."}
{"text":"Shoutout to the BWW staff. We came in in the middle of a baseball game and were immediately informed by the hostess that we could be seated but the kitchen is behind and it would be about a 40 minute wait. Thanks for the heads up! As a customer that's all we can ask for. When we were seated Ryan (I think/hope that was his name) was super friendly and accommodating and provided excellent service. He said he had been there for 12 years and it truly showed! Thanks BWW for doing everything right from beginning to end! See y'all soon!"}
{"text":"Not a bad pit stop after a good work out at the Gold's Gym next door. Gets you the protein you need and all the sports channels you can possibly watch.  If you've ever been to a Buffalo Wild Wings, you know what they serve here. I like it for the convenience and the fact that this place is larger than the other locations in the area. Therefore, there is more seating, less waiting, and is easy for big groups to dine in. On Tuesdays, you can get discounted wings; on Wednesdays, you can get discounted drumsticks; and On Thursdays, you can get discounted boneless wings."}
{"text":"The waitress spilled water all over me and didn't apologize. Then when I got my food it was completely wrong. I normally love Buffalo Wild Wings but this establishment was just terrible."}
{"text":"B-dubs is okay. I mean it is what it is, if you haven't been and like wings, you should try it out. It's a concept restaurant so the focus is on consistency over new innovation like all restaurants of this type. I'll tell you one thing though, this dude I work with has such a huge crush on this place. There is one opening in our area and I guess first 100 people in the door get free wings for a year. He's telling me, \"so when it opens, is it okay if I'm out that day to wait in line.\" Basically this place is great for bringing your Indian friends if they eat chickens."}
{"text":"Girlfriend had a craving for wings and we didn't feel like going to hooters, so we tried out this place. The wings were very good.  There are 14 flavors to choose from and they have a challenge where if you can finish 6 wings with their blazing sauce (their spiciest) within 12min your wings are free. We didn't take the challenge, but we tried their spicy garlic and wild sauce. Their wild sauce is equivalent to hooters hot flavor. I would recommend the spicy garlic if you want some flavor with a little bit of spiciness in your wings. We also ordered the queso chili fries which were good also. In my opinion, the chili fries were better than most chain restaurants I've had. There are multiple large screen TVs for you to enjoy the sports games going on. If you're in Vegas and want some wings, come here."}
{"text":"Took 10 min ( not exaggerating) to get a server to come by and great us. While at least 5 were standing around. The manager finally noticed and sent one server over. The food was good, however they messed my order up twice. First was not boneless as ordered and sauce was wrong. Than, was boneless and sauce was still wrong. They took it off the check however, do not intend on returning."}
{"text":"People are being a bit too tough on the reviews I believe....this location just opened up, it is going to take a month or two to get the place running smoothly, yes it's busy and loud, it's new and a novelty that locals don't have to drive to matthews anymore, no even veteran servers of bdubs aren't going to be stellar, the bar is a different layout than the other straight bars, ...u shaped bars are more difficult to tend....it will deff get better, I know our server rebecca at the bar was amazing, attentive, and organized  AND THAT WAS THE 3RD NIGHT THE PLACE WAS OPEN."}
{"text":"Actually didn't get a chance to eat here.  Tried to, by there was no service.  We were seated at a dirty table and I had to ask somebody to wipe it down for us.  We waited and waited and nobody even came by to take our drink order, much less acknowledge we were even there. Eventually, I turned the timer on my phone and put it on the table.  Once it reached five minutes (and we'd already been there a while already), we got up and left.  Could have been the best B-Dubs food on the planet, but I wouldn't know 'cause they never served us."}
{"text":"Yes, that's right. You see five stars here. There is only 1 reason for the five star score, and that was our server Brian (not Bryan). Came here on a Thursday night after having some drinks at a couple of bars. On this particular night, the Panthers were playing the Eagles on Thursday night football. I typically avoid places like this, but since my coworker was adventurous for lunch and had some craft beers with me (instead of Bud Light or Mich Ultra) I let him pick the dinner spot. He was talking about this place all day so I knew this is where we would end up.   The place was absolutely packed with people. The food was good but nothing great. Brian did a great job taking care of us. He was extremely busy but still never let our water glasses or beer glasses get empty. That is all I ask of a server. And to do that on a busy night is even harder, so he gets all 5 stars here. Not much to add about the place itself, just a shout out to a great server. Ask for him if you go."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum!   I love their new dry seasoning chicken wings! I tried their Buffalo flavor with extra crispy wings as usual and it was delicious!   It is a MUST!!"}
{"text":"DONT COME HERE for Fantasy Football draft!! Internet does not work. It Continously kick you out. You have to reenter the draft and possible miss your turn. Hopefully you have people in your queue. Or else you auto pick will kick in. For a restaurant who promotes fantasy drafts it has piss poor Internet to facilitate a draft...."}
{"text":"Came in for Monday Night Football - Amy was the bartender; she was as friendly and accomodating as any bartender/server I've had - insisted I sample some local beers; and sent me on my way home at the end of the night with a Pepsi after having a few beers, which I appreciated.  Atmosphere wasn't too crazy which can be the case in a lot of BW3s.  Food was good, fast, accurate.  Will def return.   Thank you"}
{"text":"We always go here to watch the UFC fights.   Service and staff is always good.   Tonight we ordered a large order of wings as well as a order of ultimate nachos. The nachos were really dry and lacking the chili and cheese so we had to order a extra cup of salsa which was no big deal.  When our wings arrived we had one small cup of ranch two pieces of celery and two carrots.  We asked for a extra ranch for our 24 wings which still wasn't enough but we made it do.   When the bill came we were charged extra for both the salsa and the ranch.  I know it's only a  extra dollar twenty but when you order a snack size you get 1 ranch for six wings with a so why should they charge for extra ranch when you only get one with 24?  Same with the celery and carrots you get the same amount with a snack size.  If there is multiple people eating a large they should include the necessary condiments to accommodate the order.  That is all.  I paid with no complaints but just beware of the sneaky up charges for stuff that should be included."}
{"text":"Don't order take out from this place. Got there on time to pick up my order and waited 25mins for 1 order of wings. I was so irritated when I left that I didn't realize they didn't include the celery and carrots. Their saving grace was the nice waitress who noticed me waiting forever and offered me a drink. No one from the To Go area seemed to care about the customer. I would have been less irritated if the restaurant was busy, but there were hardly any customers. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"What the heck happened to bdubbs man?! I've been going to this chain for YEARS. Not just this location ALL locations. At one point they were my favorite place to eat. I'm a chicken loving kind of a girl so it made sense. The past 4 times I went to bdubbs... All different locations .... It's the same ol COLD wings. Doesn't matter if I dine in or order to go the wings always come out cold. Cold fries. I thought it was just one bad day at first so I let it go, but now EVERY TIME I have to ask for it to be re-cooked or re-heat it myself if I am at home. That's sad.  Other than the cold food of all locations this SPECIFIC location really just sucks, especially if you order takeout. First of all, it won't be ready when they say it will. Second of all, don't order too much or they'll forget something.   2 stars only because it's still Buffalo Wild Wings ... My ex-favorite place to eat . Idk I guess I keep hoping they'll figure this crap out and go back to the good place it once was.      :("}
{"text":"I visit this place whenever I have cravings for wings. Traditional, bone-in is what I always order.  The taste exceptional and variety of sauces all taste good.  This is the extent of my review.   Service: Slow and almost nonexistent.  Price vs. Value:  As another reviewer stated, a $9 salad is way out of line. Wings are also priced at a premium compared to other places;  one can pay more than $11 for a plate of 10 wings if ordered with usual condiments like carrots and celery sticks. If one adds either fries or onion rings + a soft drink,  now the bill comes close to $20 per person.  Orders are frequently wrong or items missing.  As I stated, I only go there because I like the taste of their wings. I tune out all other elements."}
{"text":"This is one of the best BW3's I have been to in the Vegas area.  The staff is very personable, and the machines seem to pay out often, and well."}
{"text":"A good place to have the Las Vegas Internet Marketing Association meeting, it has a good sized dining room area, including a large bar in back. Believe it when they say they have spicy wings, as I have done the red hot wings contest. I didn't win, but the guy who did had to leave after. They do have WiFi available, but it is not always working, so bring a backup. The sampler items are pretty good to nibble on. I have yet to have a full dinner at this location."}
{"text":"the service is awful, apparently workers hate their jobs. Sunday I went with my wife and my kids and the server treated us really bad. I really like the food but will not return to that place ever. I did not go for free food, and I will not pay to treat me that way"}
{"text":"Came here a couple months later since my previous review. Had waiter John again. He improved very much and was very attentive this time from the last review. Our wings were delicious as usual. I recommend the Thai Curry sauce if you love curries. So Gooood."}
{"text":"This place has been my favorite on on every Tuesday, and I have never had any problems at all until last Tuesday!  There were 3 of us went to the restaurant together, and we were told that we had to wait at least 45mins for the next table available. Ok fine, we guess we just needed to hang around until we were called.  However, 30mins came by and we came in and check - There were several booths and tables were available. The hostess refused to sit us because the kitchen was busy and there were not a lot of servers. She asked us to wait another one hour!  One hour? I mean really?  It was freaking 9pm and we were starving! All of us were pissed, left the place and went to Kona Grill which had so much better options....  They need to do something about it - I mean Tuesday is Wings Night and they expected it not to be busy? Heck no!"}
{"text":"Didn't make it as far as ordering food. Asked for patio seating and the patio was disgusting. Sticky table, sticky floor, bird poop on table that I had to ask to be cleaned. Table wiped down with sticky substance and I called it a day. If the management can overlook such basic cleaning in the dining room, I can only imagine what goes on behind closed doors. Yuck."}
{"text":"Like always this place has the best wings i also enjoyed the onion rings and mushrooms. The waitress was very nice and friendly would definitley return. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Poorest service in the Chambana area.  If this place were an orchestra, each instrument would play their respective part of the song separately from the other, preventing the full synchrony of the music.  The kitchen is exceedingly slow, which impacts the runners and the wait staff.  The manager, who should be ensuring he smoothness of the operation, like the conductor of the orchestra, is either turning a blind eye to the issues, or isn't skilled in restaurant operations.  Waiting over an hour for our food on September 5th really is inexcusable."}
{"text":"Location, service, and wait times were fine..  But the wings were not as good as the four other locations I've been to in CA. The wings were dry, and there was something odd about them. They were not as meaty or tasty as they usually are. I went with a group of 8 and we all had the same experience. The appetizers and drinks were fine, it was just the wings that were \"off\"."}
{"text":"For a place that advertises being able to catch all the games... Football Sunday and half the TVs are off.  Of all the ones still on, only showing three games on them all.  #wastedsunday"}
{"text":"One thing about me that everyone knows is I can never turn down a chicken wing! All day, every day, I am dreaming about spicey, delicious, wings. So obviously I need to make one, or several trips to B-Dubz! Working in Gibsonia means I have limited choices for lunches, unfortunately. So I do fine myself here once in a while. This location used to be so slow, I would always go over my 1 hour lunch and that made me really not want to got there. However they do have the guaranteed 15 minute lunch which has been a success every time I have went recently. Bravo for fixing that issue!   Service is generally OK, nothing that blow me away. The food seems to be a little less quality, but it is still good. I love, love, LOVE their buffalitos!! Shockingly enough, they also have great salsa!   Over all this is a good lunch spot, and a nice place in the summer with their patio."}
{"text":"BWW had the best wings ever... I always get Asian zing and habanero mango. The food it selfs deserves 5 stars but the customer service is HORRIBLE. This place never fails the give me such horrible service. I would never suggest any one to eat here... I would say do TAKE OUT, customer service wouldn't be as bad... The foods really good but the waitress with all the condescending tones and bad attitude who shows how miserable they are at work makes my overall opinion not worth it to come... So now I only do a quick take out"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to my local BWW in a while here and I had a great time. I attribute it to having an awesome bartender who was friendly as well as having my food come out just as I had requested. Since I don't frequent BWW that often, I'll say that the guy working on Friday graveyard shift is good. I won't vouch for every staff person because I don't have a first hand account.   I ordered the Chili con Queso Dip and requested it to come out piping hot temperature-wise. It came out just that way and was really good. Also ordered were the chicken fingers with a request for the fries to be well done - again - order came out just as that.  I have no complaints with this visit. It was good especially for having one bartender who was in charge of serving everyone. The music was good and I get to watch sports."}
{"text":"Had the Scorpion Rum sauce. It's been a l-o-n-g time since I've had a sauce that was tasty and has a good burn. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Soooo I guess there is a reason why they call it \"Buffalo Wild Wings\" and not \"Buffalo Wild Burgers\".   Note to self: order food that's in the title.  I guess because Having a waffle turned out so well at Crispy Crepe, I could go 2 for 2. Yeeeeaaaa... Didn't work out so well.  The burger was dry and the patties were flat. Having two patties on the burger with the steak... It Was just my eyes being bigger than my stomach. Was not a good idea. Steak was aight. Not the best but decent.   So me and my gluttonous self ordered some hot wings and blue cheese. I looooooove hot wings and blue cheese. (Their ranch sux too). I just wanted one wing... Just one rib... I mean wing. I ate that one wing that night... And polished off the rest the next day. Gud!  Note to self: order wings at a place with \"wings\" in the name."}
{"text":"I hang out here quite often because they have NTN trivia and often mutiple people playing. They're food is certainly not the best. The wing sauce is top notch but the wings are all small and half broken. The wraps are good. All appetizers are just deep fried from frozen package usual crap. The wait staff is always really nice. I hate the fact that they try to make this a Ohio State Buckeyes bar and the staff wears Buckeyes shirts on Fridays. The walls are painted and plastered with a bunch of Ohio State crap which is pretty lame. Bottom line is it's close to my house, they have trivia and great beer selection but the food is crap and Ohio State sucks!"}
{"text":"This is a small hole in the wall place but you can't beat BW3's!!!"}
{"text":"The service is awesome, the food was great ,the drinks were cheap  we had a party of 4 we shared wings  asian zing, jerk wing, salt and vinegar, my freind had a bbq chicken sandwich everything right on cue  Rebecca was awesome    Steiners lost out on 150 due to there dumb policy's an professionalism"}
{"text":"So much variety, so little time. The honey,spicy,mild, teriyaki are all so wonderful and very flavorful.  I've never had a bad experience and all the wings I've ever had here have to be the best. Probably the only place I eat wings at. Super super super good."}
{"text":"Simply awful.   So I stopped in to watch the Suns game last night with my girlfriend and she arrived before I did. She took a seat near the bar with the large TVs nearby and waited for service. Eventually, right when I showed up, a server came over and got her a drink. She did get my drink quickly as I sat down. It all went downhill from there.   So in terms of refills, our server was terrible. Eventually we had to call her over to get her to get us some refills. Now, because we arrived for game early, we weren't trying to order right off the bat. We were trying to enjoy a night out and not feel rushed to \"eat and get out\", since we were there to watch the Suns game.   Our server seemed annoyed by this. It seemed like she wanted only to serve groups of men. I say that because our service was lousy, but she was better with the groups of guys she had that were around us. Look, I get it, a younger \"cute\" server wants to get tips from the group of guys she is flirting with, but you know what? I tip well too. So giving us bad service for no reason makes no sense.   Adding to this, when we did place an order of buffalo chips, she never brought out ranch for my girlfriend and never came back after that. Eventually, we had to ask management for another server. We got one, albeit reluctantly, from management. The new server was certainly nicer, but not competent either. The \"old\" server literally walked by and scoffed at us as well, making us feel uncomfortable.   Our final order of the night was an order of BBQ honey boneless wings. Well, they came out wrong. They gave us honey mustard wings and offered no discount or to take it off our bill. Then, with the new server, the Pepsi refills tasted like carbonation -even after I noted it to her. Outrageous! I'm not sure why they treated us so badly, we are nice people! We will never go there again.   Of course when it was time to pay, my sever magically was around suddenly (most of them were huddled up near a corner talking) to take my credit card. I did however have to wait for her to clean a large table in front of us that no one was sitting at. No apology for the awful service that night, no manager in sight, no offer to discount the wrong orders all night. Nothing. Just \"pay and get out\", which seems like what they wanted in the first place.   I habitually tip 20% or more. Both servers blew it. Management blew it. And I will let anyone who is thinking about going to this B-Dubs how bad of an idea that is. Go to Westgate. Better service and atmosphere overall. This is the worst B-Dubs I've ever been to. By far."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for my boyfriends birthday dinner. He ordered mango habanero wings and honey BBQ. Mango habanero were HOT, and the waitress exchanged them after he had two for an order of honey BBQ at no charge. I ordered spicy garlic and Parmesan garlic, which were good. We also ordered buffalo chips, would recommend with queso! The waitress also went above and beyond to make accommodations for us, and when my boyfriend did not want his beer in the chalice it comes with, she personally poured it into a regular tall mug for him even though the bartenders do not allow this. We got three drinks at the happy hot price, which was awesome. We stayed for about two hours and it was a great time, good environment and not too packed with people."}
{"text":"update: so im cruising the north end of town to hang out in the red rock casino, when i spot this BW3s - had to try it - still awesome - and the best ting about the vegas Buffalo Wild Wings and the rest of the nations other BW3s - they're open 24 hours (actually just the bar - but they serve the wings there too) - gangsta! ha.  here's my review of another BW3 -  ah yes - the \"other\" wing mega chain - BW3s - so good.  since ive been introduced to Buffalo Wild Wings about 4 years ago - i have longed for one to arrive in san diego - but prayers unanswered, i have to settle for this treat whenever im in the midwest, or vegas.  i enjoy the the traditional hot, spicy garlic and carribean jerk - but the king of all sauces is the ASIAN ZING! wow. simply outstanding. they have expanded their menu a little - and have added new sauces like the parmesan and mango habenero - but i really like these new naked skewers - much healthier options...  but who are we kidding right? hook up the 18 wing combo with some fried mushroom caps - and its on - BW3s rocks my world. thank you.  oh and btw - did i mention that the place is littered with big screen TVs and rock and roll music - perfect for those wanting to see \"the game\" (any game actually since the invent of the satellite)."}
{"text":"I keep trying to give this place a chance.. but every time I come in here, we get stuck with the same awful server, Vicki. We wait 20 minutes for drinks, 45 for food and she never comes back to check on us.. no refills!! then after all of that... we just waited 35 minutes to pay a bill, if we weren't with guests we would have just walked out! This will be our last and final time here!"}
{"text":"I've given this place many chances, primarily because I live so close - but unfortunately they have consistently disappointed.  Most recently I called an order in and was told 20-25 minutes. I show up after 25 minutes and I'm told they're very backed up and it would be another 25 minutes. *sigh* ok...typical BWW. So wait another 25 minutes and go back in...after standing and waiting for 5-6 minutes with no one so much as asking if they can help me, I again ask if my order is ready.       I'm told again they're backed up and to wait another 25 minutes...really? Fortunately the gentleman who was also there waiting for his order heard me say my name and HE had to tell the employees \"No wait, I heard them call that name a few minutes ago\".   Sure enough, my order was in fact ready but the overly competent employee were apparently too lazy to check and figured it was just easier to tell me to wait again.   Add this onto the other times my order has been wrong, constantly being shorted on the ranches I'm charged for and yeah, pretty pathetic.   Only reason I give 2 stars rather than 1 is because when I do finally get my food it's typically pretty good...but the negatives well out weigh the positives."}
{"text":"Service is just too slow... The guy next to me offered to go cook his own meal... Gimme a break we were the only ones here and it took 20 mins for a salad"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for the boneless wings. Great variety of sauces (and now dry seasoning!) for wings, with and without bones. Tuesdays are 50 cent wing nights, I think. Thursdays are 60 cent boneless wing nights, for sure. The other foods are fine. I'm partial to the Southwest Chicken Wrap.  The service can be a bit slow, especially when there's a football game on.   I would be remiss if I didn't warn you that your stomach will not be happy with you after your meal."}
{"text":"We go here all the time just to sit and chat with friends, sometimes just to sit on wing days to play games with friends and cousins and also have a snack and watch TV. The drinks are awesome love the hard cider. The waitresses that we get are always helpful and I love their new teas and lemonades NOM NOM and especially since we have the entertainment cards now with free wings yums great atmosphere for buzztime and since they added it for apps we dont have to use those playmakers anymore :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, plenty of seating, great food.  Parking is a bit of a pain, but it's worth it.  Plenty of other spots to visit before or after eating."}
{"text":"I had a terrible and unprofessional takeout  experience . Hostess Alison was very rude and on top of that overcharged me and told me that the mistake couldn't be corrected . Luckily the manager fixed the mistake . Overall the hostess needs some more training or really hates her Job and is a poor reflection of the company . I'm sure I'm not the only customer who feels this way and wanted you to be aware this is a great way to continue losing customers ."}
{"text":"Used to be 5 stars, but they stopped doing wing specials on traditional wings on Tuesdays. They still do boneless specials on Thursdays however."}
{"text":"Came here to watch Silva lose in UFC 168. And lose he did! MUAHAHAH!!!  The fights start at 7pm. I told the guys to meet up at 5pm. WHOA. The place was PACKED already! We did score a table out on the patio however ALL of their heaters were BROKEN so it was QUITE cold but service was great.  Next time we will have to arrive at 3pm! EEK!"}
{"text":"Came here for the Silva Diaz fight.  Lucky enough to have grabbed a high top table in the bar and steal some extra chairs. Lots of TVs surrounding us.   Our server was good, kept us quenched and fed.  No complaints!"}
{"text":"I actually really like their wings, however wanted to share a terrible customer service experience. We arrived on a somewhat busy day and noticed empty tables on the patio. We went inside to be seated and saw an additional few empty tables inside with a handful of people waiting. We were informed of a 15 minute wait, which normally I would not have a problem with except there were 6 hosts/servers at the front so they did not look shortstaffed and again, we had seen that at least half the tables outside were empty. When I inquired further asking the hostess to please help me understand how there could be a wait at all with so many empty tables, she said they were seating people as quickly as they could. I asked again, since there were so many employees up there, why it was taking any time at all to seat people at time he empty tables outside. She then replied that they were in the sun. This was not true, at least half of the empty outside tables were shaded and all were near misters. I pointed this out at which point, the hostess looked very irritated and said again that they were seating people as fast as they could. I became frustrated because I have never been told to wait at a restaurant that had so much available seating. Luckily, this BWW location is so close to other restaurants to choose from and we were able to get seated immediately. I will never go to that BWW restaurant again because I don't think that is right. Whatever their reason for not seating people, I just don't think it was good service. We called and told the manager who offered us to come back and be seated right away and have a free appetizer but in my opinion, good service should be provided right away not just because we complained. So we declined. I am not the kind of person to complain just get something free, just wanted to make them aware of how the situation appeared to their customers."}
{"text":"Service was slow.  Ordered wings as an appetizer and they arrived with our meal.  Asked for a few spicy and the others medium and they were all mixed together.  No wonder they had plenty of seats during March madness."}
{"text":"Do not order Jack and Diet on happy hour. The new glasses are a large shot glass. Two drink the cocktail is gone. Same price lass drink, I know the whiskey is same but more cocktail make the drink last longer."}
{"text":"Normally when we come to Buffalo Wild Wing we go in and eat, but today we did carryout. Rebecca took my order and she was absolutely amazing. I am very indecisive and she was very patient with me. I definitely apologized a lot because I kept changing my mind during the order. I finally got the order i wanted and when i picked up my order everything was correct and delicious. I would highly recommend them to other people."}
{"text":"Consistently mediocre food. One day you might get wings drowning in sauce, and the next day get scarcely any. Other than that, you pretty much know what to expect here. The food is just OK, the prices are just OK, service mostly just OK - unless you get Jared and then service is 5 star. My biggest gripes - it's always WAY too loud in the bar (loud music makes people have to shout across the table) and they charge 50c for blue cheese when they have a wing special. Really???"}
{"text":"I have a love, hate relationship with Buffalo Wild Wings.  The food is good, but for the most part it's location near the Harkins Theater make it a disaster to find parking or to consider going to as a restaurant.  That said, we've been coming here for over four years and have tried most items on the menu.    At it's core, BWW is a beer and chicken place.    Our family loves the chicken tenders over the bone-in wings.  No reason, just our preference.  If you haven't been to a BWW, please know they have over a dozen sauces, from the very mild (no heat) to mouth searing hot.  We really like the Asian Zing (Medium) and Mango Habanero (Hot).  Also, their salads are very good.  BWW has a large bar area which can get very crowded and a huge dinning room for families or large groups.  If you want to watch a game, this is the place.   They have a dozen or so big screens.   BTW, Buffalo Wild Wings runs specials on Tuesday (Wings) and Thursdays (Boneless).  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The wait is never too long. Service is good and so is the food. I just wouldnt recommend going to bww on a Saturday or Sunday night; their services is worse bc there is more people. Not to say it's all the staff's fault but I wish they were more attentive."}
{"text":"Whenever the stress levels are high, or I'm in a really bad mood, this is the place for me! It turns into boneless wings, fries and a lot of beer. Can't go wrong with any of those 3."}
{"text":"This location clearly doesn't know how to properly function on busy nights.  Where is the management observing the restaurant?   Tables need bused, customers patiently waiting and staff just standing around talking amongst themselves.  Then we get seated and wait for a while and still nobody makes eye contact and nobody takes drink order.  I stop a waiter and ask him to find out who our waiter is.  He isn't sure so he waits on us.  He took us on even though he wasn't ours.  But seriously learn to run this restaurant based on its location.  You should always assume to be busy at westgate so train the staff to be able to function on a busy night."}
{"text":"Walked in today and asked for a table for three. The place was packed because a UFC game was going on. The waitress says there is going to be a wait. I ask her how long it will be and she says I can't tell you how long. I tell her that I am only looking for an estimate of how long but she says sorry I can't tell you how long, there are three people in front of you and they have been waiting for at least half an hour. She really didn't even sound like she wanted us there. I definitely wasn't going to wait indefinitely not knowing how long the wait was going to be and I left."}
{"text":"1st day of World Series! So understandable that our food came in longer than usual. Food didn't come out as asked , BUT Deja ( our server ) kept a great attitude and handled the situation with grace. The manager Grant did a fantastic job going above and beyond to get our order right. Definitely appreciated the great customer service that was provided. After all watching the World Series and the 1st game of the season ( basketball  ) calls for only the best wings"}
{"text":"Giving BWW another go. Allison took care of me today and did an outstanding job. The place was empty again (11:45 on a Tuesday) so she should be able to.   I ordered the lunch special: Small wings with fries and a drink for $10.28 plus tip. Not bad.  I got the dry rub buffalo and it was very good. Perfect spice level, good crunch on the wings without the saucy mess. It came with 10 wings. The fries were good too. Still need to get better with the Bleu Cheese though. Compare it to the BC at Wingstop, no comparison.   All in all, my best visit yet. There's hope!  Thanks Allison."}
{"text":"Just like with any Buffalo Wild Wings this one could use better service. The food was good. During this trip I got to try a limited time wing sause made with blue moon beer I defingaly recommend it for people not looking for that spicy kick"}

{"text":"Always good service here and the food is good for bar food.  I like to come here for football games, even watched the Super Bowl last year here.  I love their shrooms! That dipping sauce makes them wonderful. But they should give a few more for their price.  The chicken wings are always good and cooked the way I asked.  They have different drink specials all the time.  I like their cheddar cheese curds and their fried pickles as well.  Good bar food. Love all the tvs everywhere.  Fun and laid back atmosphere  Very casual but clean"}
{"text":"We went to Buffalo Wild Wings in Strongsville tonight. We walked in the house looked at me like I had two heads. I said we like a table. No one in like it knowledge does someone went to clean up a table then she sat us down again looking like she was lost. Very poor customer service. The food there was okay at most little expensive for what you get. We sat down we didn't have any silverware when I asked if we can have any again she looked at me like I had two heads. Oh it all didn't look like it will not be back used to be better years ago now it's going down hill they just closed up"}
{"text":"I love coming to BDubs for the parmesan garlic wings and the buffalo ranch wrap. The staff is super friendly, and I love the sports atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is no different from any other BW3s except for the fact that this place has the great waitress Lindsey Love. Forever patient, she put up with my group of drunk friends 4 times over a 2 week span even bothering to learn our names, Jackasses 1-9. She spat back wise ass remarks to the ones we were dishing out to her, gave us sound advice on where to go to see the UFC fight, and even let us have the life sized cardboard cutout of a Coors girl. Thank you Lindsey Love."}
{"text":"Sat down at a table next to the bar and didn't receive any service for 15 minutes. Then, two bar seats opened up and the bartender was clueless. Complete disaster and wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Chicken wings are really good but the black bean burger is not worth it at all. I didn't like the fries as well. It's too much for the price"}
{"text":"Interesting sauces. A cute concept for a chain. Would be fun to come here on a game day, which we did not. Must be crazy!"}
{"text":"The wings are good here and always love getting the habanero mango, but the service the last time I went here was horrible, server was a bitch from the beginning and ruined the experience at this location, the manager didn't seem to care when we complained too."}
{"text":"Not much of wait time to get seated but the girls take forever to get the menu.. it's in slow motion.. the servers alway have some kind of attitude... also forget something.. mainly the small paper dish!! Or you ask water with lemon and just water they serve.. their services is not bad but they annoy you in the small areas. And mainly of the servers can't think fast.. I ordered house platter and lunch special with 5 extra wings. Based on my order I should get total 10 wings but got 9 wings. So I asked the server isn't my extra wing order is 5 wings.. then the server gave me a stupid look and just walked away. Few seconds later she came back with the menu... and what do you see.. even the menu said 5 for extra wing order on lunch special. So I was correct of 10 wings.. I pointed out to the server and and she rolled her eyes (from embarrassment? Idk) and few min back she did bring back that missing piece. She could of look at the menu before bringing to the table.. could of saved her embarrassment. This place only.. they annoy you in very small area where it's not a big complain.. just very annoying. On top, the house platter with traditional wing is about $15 but the one on eastern is $10-12... why? Eastern server told me traditional costs less than bonesless since their wing only price is more too.. which makes sense but this place charge less for boneless for house platter.. well to save me from getting annoyed I don't go here anymore."}
{"text":"My review / letter to management (they never responded)  Dear Customer Service Representative,  At the above mentioned date, time and location, myself and my wife visited the restaurant.  Our very poor experience started with the hostess stand which was manned by two, \"carefree children\" with no desire to conduct their duties or give an ounce of respect or greetings to customers.  Their pre-recorded wait time answer of \"we don't know\" was given to us and I was amused enough to take the pager and go wait with other patrons in line.  Total wait time 40+ minutes.  As we walked through the 3/4 full restaurant to the nearly empty patio we were seated in an area that had verifiably not been occupied for our entire wait time.  Drink order (no alcohol) took over 20 minutes to arrive and the food order was finally taken.  Basically, we were forgotten.  Also, not a single patio table had been bussed during our entire visit (approx. 2 hrs.)  As the food arrived after at least another 40 minutes there was no silverware, napkins or ordered sauces provided.  Our waitress went back to retrieve them and blamed the entire overwhelmingly unacceptable experience on the kitchen staff.  That's about the lowest one can go in the food service industry.  The reason I decided to write today is because EVERY time we come here, the service is extremely poor.  This is never the case at the Tempe location, which we love.  Thanks in advance for your attention in this matter"}
{"text":"horrendous (1/19/2016) service in the bar area, before, during and after wings arrived. lots of staff walking around while the female bartender talked to one guy at bar.  we sat there close to 15 minutes to order. when she(da bartender) finally arrived, she did give apologies for the wait??? wings arrived lighting fast, delicious, but my glass of beer was empty and the wings were HOT! had to get up and interrupted bartender talking to the same guy still,,she asked if i needed something, as im holding a large empty beer glass,,,,lol  ok, not a problem, its her first week on the job, right? well, now im done and want to leave, guess what, no check, no bartender, so i went looking for the manager. guess who i find yakking on the other side of restaurant? 10 minutes later i FINALLY get my bill at the HOTEL CALIFORNIA(can't get out). BAD, VERY BAD SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever received. Rude and smirky right off the bat. My friends ordered some drinks that were overly sweetened so they asked to switch them for something else. I guess that gave him grounds to pass us to another server because he \"didn't want to deal with us\" as he stated to the new waiter in passing. We can here you bro. The bar isn't that big. And then he goes to other guests and starts complaining about us to them. So unprofessional and for something as minor as wanting a drink changed. Idk what that was all about. Never coming back to this location though. We've been coming for years and this just pushed us over the edge."}
{"text":"Went in to order some spicy wings for takeout.  When I got them to my room, they were still warm.  They were fully coated with the correct sauce and tasted great.  The chicken was fully cooked yet tender and juicy.  The french fries were nice and crispy."}
{"text":"The service was great and the wings are always excellent. :)  Cold beer, hot wings, great appetizers... perfect place to go and watch some football."}
{"text":"For being in a very busy city this is one of the best BWW we went to! Our server was Kevin and he was a very nice guy! Always came to our table quickly, there was barely a wait time on our drinks, food was run at a good speed-all while taking care of a bunch of other tables! We were a bit of a demanding party of 5 and he showed us a great time and engaged us while we were watching a bunch of play off games. Love going to the Vegas BWW thanks to that guy! Great, attentive service!"}
{"text":"My husband I come here regularly to play trivia with each other during happy hour. I tried the new mole sauce they have on special. The server was very helpful in recommending a sample before dousing my naked wings in the sauce. His opinion is that it's a bit sweeter than you'd expect, and I totally agree - don't expect Mexican mole flavor at a BWs :)  Service is always great here, and the food is as decent as any typical sports bar and grill. I always get their salads or naked wings, though I've enjoyed their garlic mushrooms. I wouldn't mind them to fry their \"chips\" (wavy potato slices, not your standard chip) more so that they are crispy."}
{"text":"One star is being charitable. We went into a chain knowing it wouldn't be good but this even failed our low expectations. A basket of so onion rings was $7.99 and had ten small onion rings in it. Seriously? Burger was paper thin, boneless wings were mediocre (and this is their wheelhouse) service was almost non existent. Terrible"}
{"text":"the wings and sauce were on point. the draft beer selection was impressive.  I hunted down the manager to ask him if he could change the sound from the nfl draft (3rd round) to the nba playoffs. he took a poll over the mic immediately and changed the sound the fairest way possible(crowd reaction). the only reason this establishment is not getting 5 stars is because my friends and I all had trouble with getting comped drinks that we deserved based on our gaming."}
{"text":"This place has decent food and good service, but you've got to be in a particular mood to put up with the noise and crowds.  BWW is really more a sports bar than a restaurant.  There are TV's all over the place with every sport event happening around the world playing on one TV or another.   I can handle this place for about an hour and then I'm ready for some Motrin and a quiet room to find my zen.    If you are a sports nut and love bar food, BWW is probably your home-away-from-home."}
{"text":"I really like BWW but this one branch is the worst of all. For some reason the food does not taste as good as on other BWW branches. Service quality is variable. If you want BWW go to some other branch."}
{"text":"Great place to relax have a dinner and a drink after work. The food is great if you are into sports bars and that type of grub. The staff is also intent on making sure you're happy."}
{"text":"Came here for wings and the fights. Gets packed so come early. Service still good even when busy. Will definetly be back on fight nights."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I called them to order for pickup the lady told me let me put you on a brief hold 20 mins later i hang up and called back. I talked to a guy as soon as he answer I told him that i was on hold for 20 mins he did apologize but he put me on hold again..... i love buffalo wild wings but horrible service."}
{"text":"I thought the uptown location was bad, this place is worse! The service is awful. The to-go orders always taste like they have been sitting out for WAY too long. I get there 5-10 minutes before the pickup time and it's cold and sweaty.  I prefer going to the uptown location it's way bigger and better than this location."}
{"text":"Awful! Every time I come here I always think it'll be better than the last, but nope their service is very bad and they are ALWAYS forgetting items I pay for.  I bought 40 wings, a side of Cole slaw and a basket of fries this last time, and I also paid for EXTRA ranch (like the big containers)I was only given 3 tiny containers of ranch. What am I supposed to do with that? Give everyone a tiny drop of ranch?!  When I asked where the 3 big ranch's were he said they ran out of the big containers, but yet he charged me for the big containers of ranch.  He kept rushing me and trying to help someone else when I was still pointing out what I was missing. Paid for 40 wings, Cole slaw, basket of fries, and 5 ranch containers.  It's ridiculous how much they charge for sauce when they don't even give it to you."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to meet some friends. Had heard a lot about BWW, and was quite excited to try it. Wow what a colossal disappointment.  The place was semi busy. We pulled up at our table outside and waited and waited and waited. Finally we got a waitress. We ordered and waited and waited and waited. 45 minutes later we were delivered slightly warm so-so wings. My advice..... Fly away from this place."}
{"text":"The front door has a sign stating, all firearms are banned. Absolutely ridiculous!  Is this a anti-police establishment?  Are they not able to enjoy lunch or dinner here because they carry a firearm?"}
{"text":"How sad. . We eat at bww all the time. For whatever reason we ate here instead of the millions of unique options around us... That would probably be my husband's fault. Anyway. Servers were great. Except the silverware and napkins never arrived.  Food just was lacking this time. Just missing something. We did try the new flavor of wings which is similar to cinnamon apple (angry orchard) and it was pretty good, my husband said epic and I said ok. But in the end not too shabby. The vanilla lager drink was so so. Meh.   Overall a mediocre experience, but I'm kinda biased towards ma and pa places versus chains...Not that they don't have their place"}
{"text":"This place always has good food and the bomb wings. I like the garlic or hot wings yum. We have gone here over the years but last went for a UFC fight. We got there around 530 and lucked out the Simone left the actual bar seating shortly after my husband and I got there. I ordered a tea figuring I had to pace myself because the main  bout would probably by closer to 9. My tea was around 3 bucks. I saw this after we got the bill and my dos Equis was 7 bucks each. Ouch. Just be warned. Don't know if that's the reg price now or special event pricing. It was fun and the food was good."}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings location usually has great service, unfortunately, today I got a server named ASHLEY that was beyond horrible. She was not helpful in any way. She did not come to our table to check on us once. Very unpleasant waitress with nothing, but attitude."}
{"text":"Boneless wings came dry and cold. Think they were from the day before. Maybe we'll stick to bone in and hope they are fresh at another location"}
{"text":"We went to this Buffalo Wild Wings last night with my friend total of like 7 of us they put us at the tables put together the tables were two different sizes one was smaller which was annoying  but not as bad as being crammed in with so many tables all around us we hardly had any room to get us all in they have wayyyyy too many tables crammed all together very uncomfortable for people need to take out a few and then had a server named frank from the seconded he came our table he just had a rude tone and rude look my friend said last time she came she has the same server and and he was the same way he didn't say hi welcome or anything took our drink order and seemed annoyed came back a few minutes later to take our order and we didn't see him again someone else brought our food never came to see how we were or if we needed anything had to ask someone else for ranch we were done eating and waiting for him asked the manger to get us to go container he finally came over about 10 minutes later asked if we need anything else as he sees up gathering our stuff we ask for the check and he brings it right away we start getting out our money and he stands there's the entire time just waiting for us as we split the check and as soon as we put the money down he just grabs it he was no where to be found the entire time we were there nearly hour and a half until it was time to get his tip! Very upset with the service we got and won't be going back to that location"}
{"text":"Worst experience at a restaurant ever. I will definitely never ever come back. My food was cold, my drink had no ice, and everyone there had a terrible attitude to me. Sorry all I wanted was ice in my drink considering I didn't ask for no ice. It's July I would like ice in my drink!"}
{"text":"I am extremely dissapointed! I call the restaurant 6 times for a carry out and no one answered the phone!I decided to drive there, I walk inside and wait for well over 15 minutes for someone to help me at the counter. So no one answered the phone or counter. Finally someone came to the counter and said we where doing shift change. I will not be returning to buffalo wild wings. They just lost a customer! So sad"}
{"text":"Placed a takeout order when I was out and about; short on time. When I arrived to pickup my order I had to wait 15 minutes before receiving my order which appeared to have been sitting for 15 minutes. Wrote this location twice about the cold food and no response. I used to be a monthly regular and won't be back."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, a little wait but well worth it. It's very clean. They did an good job on the remodel. It's close to home so that's always a nice perk."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, nor great but it was one of the few places we could get a bite to eat before the Fiesta Bowl without a huge wait time. Service was decent, considering how busy they were. I'll probably check this out next time I'm up there for a game, it's the fastest seating and service I've had yet."}
{"text":"Delicious Great service , wings are on point love and respect. Will be a lifetime customer."}
{"text":"Their street tacos during happy hour are the best thing ever i love the food and the atmosphere. Prices are really high for chicken wings though. I usually have to get the sampler tray just to get chicken wings at a good deal which isnt exactly a complaint but the foods very good just pricey."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place negative stars...we got there around 5 sat down placed our drink and food order..and then we waited and waited for our food almost 30 minutes later we got our appetizers and wings. We then sat around for another 20 minutes waiting for a Togo box and then had to wait until a completely different waitress asked if we wanted our check. We walked out 10 minutes to 7...Our waiter was the worst waiter we have ever had ANYWHERE. We will never come here again!"}
{"text":"If I had a choice to put a zero star rating I would. The service here is always HORRIBLE. Idk why I even bother coming back. I always try giving ppl benefit of the doubt, but nope. Last time here. Came with a party of 20, after graduation. And well it's took thirty minutes to get our drinks. Only one girl at bar serving adult beverages. Wait time before that was about an hour. Maybe more. I get my food and half my order was missing. They didn't even have mayo. I highly recommend you steer clear of this bdub location. It's SH**!!!"}
{"text":"Came in around 9:30 last night and was seating right away. Our server was awesome , very nice and attentive. Started out with the quest dip which my boyfriend and I love queso dip and thought this one was good . Then we got the pepper jack steak wrap and half honey bbq and the Thai curry wings to all share. The wrap was good and so was the honey bbq wings ( I always get that flavor ) but the Thai curry wasn't good at all. The  flavor is more like a Indian curry and it seemed like a dry rub rather than the sauce.  That was the only thing that was disappointing"}
{"text":"Quality of the food is excellent! Tastes fresh everytime...drinks are a little overpriced! Staff is nice and friendly"}
{"text":"9/17/2015 Savoy, Illinois My wife and I stopped in for dinner shortly after 5 p.m., noticed it wasn't that busy. On a 1 to 10 scale, the restaurant was a 9 for cleanness. Our waitress, Kathrin, gave us menus and got our drinks; but my wife noticed that the waitress did not tell us her name. I couldn't remember if she did or not because the music was just a tad too loud for me. We asked if we could order dinner for the two of us while placing a to go order of boneless wings for our daughters. Kathrin, went out of her way to make sure we could. My wife and I noticed that the Teriyaki boneless wings were still piping hot and really had a good amount of sauce on them when we got them home. But the mild boneless wings were barely warm and pretty dry. Seemed that what sauce they put on them soaked into the wings. Usually in the past, the mild wings had plenty of sauce while the teriyaki wings had sauce but not as much as we had this time. Our daughters ate them anyway and were happy so as long as they were happy, that what matters.  As for my wife and my dinner, I had the Buffalo Ranch Chicken sandwich and fries with mild sauce instead of the medium sauce that usually comes with it. My wife had the pulled pork sandwich with teriyaki sauce with fries & coleslaw. My wife doesn't eat coleslaw but I do, I had two bites of the coleslaw and that was enough. Chunks of cabbage and a watery mayo tasting coleslaw dressing, was not impressed. Needed some vinegar and a dash of salt or something. All in all, I was really close to giving this place 5 stars but my wife wasn't as impressed as I was. Would give it 4 and a half stars if I could."}
{"text":"7/27/2015 5:45pm Usually, my wife and I go to the store in Savoy, Illinois to eat but decided to grab some take out from this store in Champaign, Illinois. Was greeted at the take out counter by what I am guessing is one of their managers, named Shane or Shawn. Asked about the Thursday night boneless wings special and was told that \"yes\" boneless wings was that night's special.  Ordered 24 boneless teriyaki, a pulled pork sandwich, as well as 12 boneless mild wings. Shane or what ever his name was seemed lost looking at the computer screen. He actually had to have one of the servers actually point out which menu on the screen to press. He then asked if we wanted bone in wings, we had to tell him again that we wanted the boneless wings since it was the Thursday night special. Apparently, this manager was taught well on greeting the customer, but had no clue how to ring up someone's order. You would think that learning the register would have been one of the things managers learn before all the other manager duties.  The lady that gave us our food was very friendly and asked if we needed extra napkins and plastic ware. The food was still hot and good to eat when we got home. If the manager was better trained, probably would have given them 4 stars, possibly 5 stars if it wasn't $35.25 just for that amount of food to feed our family."}
{"text":"Traditional wings are not the scrawny little things so many places have. Great selection of sauces. Have not tried every flavor yet, but I will. Other food items are great as well.  Service was always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I seriously only come here for the drinks and they even manage to mess that up too sometimes. I never get wings from here anymore considering they just slap on the sauce. It seems their money maker is the sporting events where they'll get a large turn out. Even so, don't waste your time. Their drinks are mediocre. Look elsewhere"}
{"text":"The place rocked my world the food was great and management was very helpful I meet one of the cooks jd and he helped me out with my pick on wing sauce I will defiantly be goin back their often!"}
{"text":"Must read!!!   Bruh this place is garbage man. I ordered medium portion of wings and my girl ordered a small.  She got 12 pieces and I got 13!  Why am I paying an extra 5 dollars for 1 more??   Obviously the cooks don't know how to count or never went to elementary school.   If you ever come here just get the snack portion. You'll probably get like 10 wings."}
{"text":"Does anyone know any bdubs that won't mess up an order??   My girlfriend and I came in for the Tuesday special. We ordered the medium size. 10 hot BBQ 5 honey BBQ and 15 buffalo dry rubbed. ALL FLATS. We also got carrots because that's what the Tuesday special includes.  We waited about 20 minutes for our food and received only 10 hot BBQ 5 honey BBQ and 5 buffalo. The guy that brought out our food asked us if it was the right order. I told him there should be 10 more buffalo. He look at the receipt confused and went and ordered the cooks for more.   15 minutes later the last 10 wings come out. This place automatically lost 4 stars from these set of wings. This set was NOT all flats. The ones that weren't flats were over cooked. I had a hard time eating them. Oh and they had NO buffalo rub at all. Good thing I asked for extra rub on the side, twice.  We also had to ask for our carrots because they didn't come out until we asked for them, which was half way through our meal. Btw we only received like 5 carrots haha.  Idk man. Bdubs had been sucking lately.   Medium = 15 but with bogo = 30 every bdubs I went to it seems like our servers don't know how to count. Oh well. At least I know this location deserves way less stars then what it is given on yelp."}
{"text":"I can't even give this place one star it was the worst food and service I have had in Vegas. When we got there we asked for a booth and they said they didn't have any when there were two available.  We ordered 20 boneless wings and got 20 bone in wings. They let us keep them and the said it will be 10 min for our new wings to come out. 20 min later we received our wings with hardly any sauce on them ate maybe one and called it a day. Needless to say I will not return to Buffalo Wild Wings"}
{"text":"Went to this location before the ACC Championship game to watch a little football and hang out.  Was seated immediately and allowed to stay at the same table for nearly 3 hours despite the restaurant getting busier and busier.  Of course I was continuously ordering food and drinks and not just getting free Coke refills.  Server was very friendly and accommodating.  Fried pickles were quite good, Chili con queso was just generic cheese sauce with pre-made chili tossed in, nothing very special at all and a little disappointing to say the least.  I ordered the boneless wings, mango habenero, as my entree.  While the sauce was quite spicy and tasty, the 'wings' (read: chicken nuggets) had a little too much breading on them and tasted as if they had spent a minute too long in the fryer.  They were tough in spots and a little dry.  Good place to hang out and drink a few beers, but the food is just so-so."}
{"text":"We just left and did not get fed.  The wait staff is just that they make you wait.  We sat there for over 7 minutes without one of the 5 servers that walked by us.  They did not say a word.  I asked for the manager and she came by and took our drink & appetizer order.  We got the appetizer (without napkins or silverware) before we got our drinks (sodas and water).  When they came and delivered the food we were missing 1/3 of the order and what we did get was reheated and inedible.  We still did not have silverware.  After we waited 5 minutes the server stopped by to say she was sorry for the mix up.  It was too late, I asked to see the manager one more time as we were leaving.  The manager did stop by to apologize for the night. We selected the wrong place to celebration our daughter getting her driver's license. We may try another BWW but we will not go back to this one."}
{"text":"My grandson and were out celebrating his birthday and this was his choice for lunch prior to the movie.  We told the waiter our time frame and he delivered the food to then just vanish. We didn't get to take our food and were late for our movie.  I had to enlist another server to even get my check.  My grandson had been eying \"sauce\" across the street and on the way out told the gaggle of servers hanging by the door we wouldn't be back but we're going to sauce next time.   Even a 6 year old knows bad service!"}
{"text":"1pm on Thursday 6/26/18 Ordered boneless wings medium, got Mickey D chicken NUGGETS half coated with sauce luke warm. Also ordered potato wedges, must of ran out and gave me what was left in the basket that was fried 2 or 3 times. Hard as a rocks! Won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Bartender was rude. Girl w/short hair in particular. She was NOT friendly towards my friend and I. But as soon as some dudes sat down, girl perked right up. Second BWW I've been to, with TERRIBLE service."}
{"text":"I've sat in the restaurant once and in the bar area a few times. First off, all the sports on all the walls: AWESOME!!!!!! You can come in and watch a few games at the same time and just enjoy a couple hours of entertainment. That entertainment does come with a price, though.   The food is meh. I really can't describe it. It's there. It's edible. That's about it. It is fun to try the varity of wing sauces, though. Some of them can get pretty pontent! The service is meh+. We were kinda rushed out the day we were in the dining room, and I've had to wait waaaaaay to long for a beer, hell even to get acknowledged at the bar. The prices hurt a little bit, but I guess they do have to pay for their sports packages and you don't have to. The fact that you can buy bottles of their sauces is a huge plus. Their bold anti-2A stand point is very off putting, but a lot of patrons go to drink and drinking and carrying is a big no-no. That should be something that the state regulates, though and BWW shouldn't police the innocent.   This place is walking distance from the house (albeit a long one, up a hill), which is a huge saving grace for them."}
{"text":"I've come to Buffalo Wild Wings so many times and I keep coming back  Star 1 is for the food! Their sauce variety is great and their limited time sauce was amazing. They don't even charge extra money for extra sauce on the wings.  Star 2 is for the service. Our waitress checked on us just enough. She wasn't pushy but always checked on us when the time was right.  Star 3 is for the atmosphere. It's your typical sports bar type of atmosphere which is great for wings.  Star 4 is for the food being worth the price. While I'm not satisfied with their wings being 70 cents now. They are still so good that I keep coming back for more. Plus I didn't even buy my wings this time because my friend offered to pay.  Star 5 is for the Wow factor. Buffalo Wild Wings just continues to wow me with their excellent wings."}
{"text":"The management in this place must not care very much about anything, or are very oblivious. The staff here as a whole is pretty bad.  I've been here a few times in over the pay few years, and the orders are consistently wrong  and/or luke warm. Waitstaff gets rude when you address a mistake they made.  They are mostly concerned with their phones.  Sad."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Didn't even get silverware or napkins for the table. Waited 15 minutes for a box. Food was ok atmosphere fun.  Wouldn't waste my time or money again"}
{"text":"Every time I've been to the Buffalo Wild Wings off of Wadsworth Boulevard in Colorado I've had feathers on my chicken wings hair they've only been there for 5 times deathly not recommended I'm positive note there dry rub is amazing and their sauces are really good gotta love the boogers and cum"}
{"text":"Hey I am a huge fan of Buffalo Wild Wings... Huge Fan... However it's been a long time since I have been to the Vegas ones... So while I was in Vegas went to one of my favorite Wild Wings... The server had an attitude... But, the worst part when I went to the restroom to wash my hands... OMG the restroom was filthy... and I mean filthy... I reported it to the manager a short stocky guy... He kind of shrugged and says we have been busy.... I mean this place was beyond filthy... I mean what does their kitchen look like..."}
{"text":"Doesn't have to be bust to get bad service here. Manager to too busy doing nothing or hiding than to help out or at least apologize for the bad service"}
{"text":"There really isn't anything better than wings!! We were here for a quick dinner. The chicken wings were like they always are when we come here. Great! We also ordered the onion rings. Very greasy and soggy. Other than the fact it took an amazingly long time to get our order the waiter was consistently refreshing our water. Not really the place for a quite date, but a good place to eat some wings and watch one of the many huge TV screens."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we came to eat here. My husband asked for coffee, said they don't get reg coffee delivered any more but if you want decaf, can get it brewed for you, with an attitude. I ordered the cod sandwich which no cheese. She brought out with cheese. She was like I must not of heard you. Do you want to keep that and eat it OR Do you want them to make you a fresh one? Her attitude was like it was my fault, I had said no cheese, twice. She had a beef against my twin or something. She just asked for some salsa. And she asked her what it was for. My twin replied, for my mac n cheese. Waitress, said you might not like it. When my husband and I ordered cod sandwiches, his with the cheese. He looked his and says, no tartar sauce. So when she comes back with the salsa, I asked for Tatar sauce. Again with an attitude, we have two kinds, but I don't know if you'll like or not. Meanwhile, she asked if my husband wants refill of soda and brings it with the tartar sauce. Then came my cod sandwich. This whole time, my twin is closer to her then I am, yet she never once asked about a refill for her, clearly her glass is empty.  She brought our check, I HAD TO ask for refill for my twin.  The place had a few guests.  The food was great but that attitude. Like we came to bother her or something. Hope she had a better time afterwards."}
{"text":"BWW has changed since it's earlier days. I used to love coming here for UFC fight nights and their killer happy hour with my cube farm mates. Now, I pick BWW as my back-up bar, only because Hooters doesn't put the sound on for games and I need a change of venue from Zipps. And the ironic thing, their TVs are really projectors which kills for a visually stimulated tech geek like myself. You can get overwhelmed by the \"31 flavors\" of wing sauce but my fave is the Asian Zing; and for a meat eater like me, I like my wings fatter. I was surprised they don't have weekend specials during the football games; what better time to keep the crowd drinking and happy then that?!?! They regulate their beer pours, so the glass is never full and did away with the best HH menu item, corn dog bites. It's definitely not my first choice for sports bar but you will always get consistently friendly staff and an exact amount of beer."}
{"text":"Tuesdays are great at BWW. Delicious half-priced wings with free trivia. Great beer selection and fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"I miss BW-3. I miss the name and I miss the just a notch above a dive bar status it carried along with it. The glorification of the Buffalo Wild Wings is shrug worthy. It's like going to a fancy McDonalds. Dude, you're still at McDonalds.  That said, with my search for the perfect wing far, far from satisfaction, we went to make sure that our wing desires were sated, if not satisfied. Mission accomplished, BDubs. Your Asian Zing flavor was tasty -- almost a Thai like candied sweet and heat flavor that left a great deal of heat lingering for moments afterward. Not too much heat, but, just enough to remind me of what I just ate. The Spicy Garlic, my old standby, were just spicy enough to need a sip of beer after each one.  The rest of the experience? Well, I can't blame our lethargic waitress for being a lethargic waitress. I'd be a lethargic waitress if I were 1) able to be a waitress and 2)waiting tables at a BDubs on a Thursday night around 630PM. Still though, a little enthusiam won't kill you. Maybe a smile here and there? Though, in the interest of full disclosure: If given the choice between Joanna and Brian, I'll take Joanna 100% of the time. Give yourself 10 cool points if you get that reference."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have had great service. Came here for dinner on a Sunday evening and it was fairly quiet. Our server Amanda J. was beyond amazing! She was very attentive, brought everything out in a timely manner and everything was perfect. Will definitely come here again and hope Amanda J. is here to take care of us!"}
{"text":"While the prices aren't bad, you get what you pay for.  In my experience the food is hit or miss.  Sometimes the wings are great, sometimes they aren't.    If I go to a restaurant I'm looking for consistency in the food and service.  Their waitstaff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  My biggest gripe is that it is extremely loud in there.  Even when there isn't any major sporting event on TV.  It is very hard to hold a conversation.    Overall, I feel that this is an okay place to go watch a game, but not so great to have a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Tis used to be one of my favorite places to eat and have a beer. When my wife got pregnant she didn't want to eat here anymore. Since we had our baby 3 months ago I have eaten here about 5 times. All 5 times have been a disappointment. I guess I would go here for a beer but I don't know if I will be returning there for wings."}
{"text":"Looks pretty nice.  Bathrooms are clean - everything is handsfree (including toilet) and works wells (including timing of the flush).  Placement of the TVs are nice - everywhere.  Wings are consistent, as expected.  And the service was on task.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and EVERYTIME I order to go they don't put in my order until I arrive to pay. I would understand if it was only Friday nights or holidays I come. But it's usually a Wednesday morning or a day that you would think is dead. And almost always it is empty when I come in. For some reason they give me a time that it will be ready by and when I show up 5 minutes after it should be ready, and I now have to wait 20 more minutes for them to make my food. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Love BWW.  Excellent wings... haven't had any service issues...   Gets REALLY busy in the evenings.  I was surprised.  One thing that still irritates the crap outta me about B-Dubs is that they allow kids in the bar area.  To me, that's a big no-no.  I go to a bar to enjoy being WITHOUT screaming kids.  But this one isn't the only one that does it... I've experienced it at all of them."}
{"text":"Took boys here to watch football. Please note I was Manager in restaurant for 10+ years. Seated us close to table that was supposed to be used for folding napkins/silverware, but was obviously employee break area for eating (while in full uniform), texting, backs turned to us. Several even stood up to watch game replays, blocking our view. Mediocre food at best. Obviously training and the perception of the customer are not priorities here, totally gives against Hospitality 101...Most annoying was several employees just idly standing around ignoring us, not smiling. Wow, if one of my mentors in this industry had caught any of us doing just one of these, instant suspension, second offense termination..sad for a prince Vegas location"}
{"text":"This is our first time at their new location. The restaurant had a great design with TONS of TVs. The food was great, and the service was as well. I tried the brat burger tonight and it's easily on my top 3 favorite burgers"}
{"text":"Always down for some wings. This spot is pretty spacious like most Buffalo Wild Wings. Plenty of TVs.   Some friends got wings. They were freakin huge. Like chicken from Jupiter or something. The boneless wings were larger than normal as well.   Our group tried diff flavors. My go-to is lemon pepper. I like the asian zing and teriyaki now.   When in the area would def come back.  Good staff"}
{"text":"I came here to nurse a hangover/slash hang out with friends (but mostly to nurse a hangover). The food here is always delicious and no matter how long I go without having the wings, I crave them. I don't have a specific preference on the wings - they're all amazing - but yesterday I fell in love with the Spicy Garlic! The amount of sauce was perfect and the flavor was amazing. I could eat a billion of those.  Also, just for kicks, I always get the Mango Habanero which is a damn punch to the trachea, but in the most pleasurable way. Trust me. Try it. I also tried the Wild flavor which is ranked as spicier than Mango Habanero but those were a disappointment. Maybe move those down a bit."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with friends June 28th, 2018. We normally come here all the time and normally don't have bad experiences; however, this time around it was horrible. I understand that we were a large party of 8, but that's no excuse for the lack of service, long wait, or lack of competency. The waiter spilled water on me, did not say a word nor give me napkins until I ASKED. The food took over an hour and half to get to our table and not even all of it came. We still had to wait for the rest of our orders. While waiting the waiter never came to our table asking of we need anything such as water or other drinks. I love buffalo wild wings, but I don't think I will be coming back to this location.  EDIT: Still here even after asking for the check."}
{"text":"BDUBZ!!! Please make your online ordering more user-friendly.   The fact that the site tells you that the order will be ready @ XX:XX time and thank you and THEN you have to click a small button on the bottom to confirm is confusing. This results in a hangry frustrated customer because when you get to the to go counter they dont have your order at all."}
{"text":"This was the first experience I had eating at Buffalo Wild Wings. The server I had was great and the food was amazing as well. The price was reasonable and there was no wait when I had arrived on a Friday evening. The place was clean. I will definitely come by this place again in the near future.  (Thank you for reading this review - I am writing reviews of everywhere I eat when I dine out, places I shop, movies I watch and much more.  Stay posted with #ReviewByMariaMescal)"}
{"text":"I love BWW. Scott, Tanisha, and everyone else were super friendly! I've been to different locations of BWW but they are not good. Very rude compare to this one. Don't even waste your time going to the other BWW."}
{"text":"Maria the host was very rude and unprofessional. sat a few family's before us when we were next. gave dirty looks the WHOLE service. said we couldn't sit outside when we could have. everyone else was very nice and helpful though."}
{"text":"This location is amazing! We are always welcomed by a friendly face. Servers are always in a great mood. They play a variety of music country, hip hop, dance, and everything else 70s to now. Food is always fast, fresh, and perfect. This whole place is very clean. They have a separate family restroom for the babies and toddlers. Servers are always checking on your table to make sure everything is alright. Great job to this team, you are all amazing!"}
{"text":"This place has definitely lost all there customer service. We had been coming here for a few years, but it seems a change in staff/management really has affected the business. We went in and were seated within 5min by the hostess, 30 minutes go by and no one has addressed us or even asked to bring us drinks. During the wait I take my daughter to the restroom, filthy, garbage all over the floor and garbage coming out of the trash can like it's been sitting for days. Another family arrives and a server goes straight to their table and takes drinks order. We ask how much longer for our table? Her response was to walk away. Please save yourself a headache and drive the extra 10min to their location off centennial/5th(they have fast,friendly service every time)."}
{"text":"This was a much better experience than our last. We did not get to sit at the bar but we did have a table in the bar area. Our server was Vanessa and she was awesome. Came to check in on us multiple times and had a great attitude. Mannylyn  (excuse the spelling) was very upbeat and personable. We told her that even though our last experience was rough,  we are regulars and will still come and enjoy BWW."}
{"text":"I eat at this Buffalo Wild Wings at least once every 2 weeks.  I love watching sports here, the wait staff actually recognizes us and food is always consistent.  Great beer prices for happy hour, we can always watch whatever sporting event we want to see, and food quality is consistent.  3 stars in this case simply means frying chicken wings is not a culinary art, lol.  I have been here many times, will go back too many more, and if you love chicken wings, beer and sports like I do, you should have nothing to complain about here."}
{"text":"I love this place!  But let's be real, I don't think the purpose of Buffalo Wild Wings is to set the culinary world on fire.  It specializes in chicken wings... or boneless chicken bites.  I love the mozzarella sticks, queso dip, and their French fries also.  All of the servers at this location have been pleasant and prompt with our orders.  The guest captain has always been accommodating in finding a game to put on whatever TV we ask for.  I would give it 4 stars because I go here so much, but that wouldn't make sense to my actual 4 star recommendations.  Here's what to expect:  Good wings or boneless wings - check Beer - check Sports - check Entertainment (trivia, poker, jukebox) - check Friendly service - check Good location - check  Don't be overcritical.  Just enjoy your beer and wings - the name says it all."}
{"text":"So we have been here  a few times but after the other night I will no longer go  to this establishment ! Just baffled at the horrible service  we received here ...there is a waiter named Aaron  he served our food I ordered  a burger with some sort of chicken strip on it it came to us and the burger had no lettuce and no tomatoes it was plain so then our waiter never came by to check on us ? The whole night ! So then I ask another waiter to help with this mistake and she said you have to order the lettuce and tomatoes?? Really on a burger ? Get real !  So my girlfriend ordered a chicken wrap when it arrived it looked like it came from the kids Menu  ? Another ridiculous  mistake no sauce so then we ordered more sauce .......no napkins at all were left only the ones with our silverware long story short horrible service horrible lazy waiters that don't care about good costumer service Manager who doesn't run the store right some fat white guy with a red shirt who never once apologized  for the horrible service I downloaded this yelp app just to write this review ...so if you want lazy waiters and rude management be a guest and go here I'd prefer Dennys any day over this crappy  service! Wish there was a star option!"}
{"text":"Love the asian zing & honey bbq wings!  I come here religiously & have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I thought this was sorts restaurant, and not a club. Would have been nice to you hear the game, in a sports restaurant, and not the shitty 40 top. Food has gone downhill, and the servers are pretty crappy."}
{"text":"Any place where I can drink beer, watch the game and play trivia all while breathing in the goodness of smoke-free oxygen deserves at least 4 stars. Forget about everything else, this place has a strict no smoking policy and that makes me a very happy person.   I stopped in here Tuesday night around 7ish and b-dubs was packed. The happy hour crowd was just starting to filter out so I was able to get a seat at the bar. The stools at the bar are so much better if you can snag one. The stools around the tables don't have backs and they suck. If you're going to be here for any amount of time get a barstool that you can at least lean back in.   Tuesday is 45 cent wing day so I ordered lots of  chicken wings in different sauces. My favorites are mango habanero which is my \"go-to\" and jammin jalapeno which I had never tasted before but loved. The wings here are very small so I usually order a few more than I normally would at other wing joints. The service is pretty average, about what you would expect from any popular chain. I like the smokeless atmosphere and lots of little wings in different sauces, so for that, I'll go back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Andrew was so rude! Never coming back to this location. I have better service at LVBLVD and that place gets busy!"}
{"text":"National wing day today according to many social media sites so I decided to meet some friends at BWW for lunch.  I've not been to one of these famous wing places in the past as it's never been close but let's venture out to celebrate! Let me say I will never go back. We ordered medium buffalo wings- 3 of the 9 that came in the order had any sauce on them at all. The other 6 were blank. So we asked for a side of sauce.  I ordered the build your own burger-  with everything + mayo.  No mayo. Burgers are apparently served dry like the wings.  So we also asked for the mayo at the same time as wing sauce.  We then watched our server take an order, cash out a table and bus a table.  13 minutes later she realized she had forgotten our condiments and she walked back to the kitchen and got them.  I ate one bite on my bet cold burger (no mustard either) and we ate 5 of the 9 cold wings. When she finally checked back on us it was with the check and offered no boxes and did not inquire once about the food.   My BWW experience was terrible service poorly served mediocre food and no real presence to care about the experience from any member of the staff.   I am not sure how they pay for all of those commercials, it will not be with any of my money."}
{"text":"The hostess Jocelyn (small woman with heavy makeup) was horrible to deal with. There are two sides of the dining area and one side had a large rowdy party and a smaller louder party and there were dirty napkins everywhere on the table and much of the table trash was also on the floor. We had my two year old daughter with us and she led us to a booth directly adjacent to the large party. How were we supposed to fit the high chair between us and the adjacent table? Also, the seats were ripped. And when I asked her to move to the other side of the dining room she rolled her eyes at me and brought us one table away. Not what I asked for. Our waiter, Dorian, was great and he finally moved us to the opposite side without the attitude and of course we heard the two hostesses complaining very loudly about us not wanting to sit on that side of the dining room. This was during the end of the lunch hour (around 2:00) and the place wasn't very full although both sides of the dining area had smaller parties. I think this location should revamp their hostess' attitudes and clean up as the one side also smelled like a dirty diaper. The food came quickly and we were given a good amount of attention by our waiter."}
{"text":"Let's start with the housekeeping isn't the greatest.  My waitress then punched in my order wrong.  Finally got that corrected.   They only carry the pink sweetener.   When my new wings come out one is the wrong dry rub.  I've been waiting for about 10 minutes now.   We had to ask three times for napkins.  My coworker and I ordered carrots and celery.  Had to ask for those 4 times.  When the manager dropped them off he just put them on the table and walked away.   My waitress just came to my table and asked if I wanted the bill.  No.  I want my freaking wings.   This place is a disaster and should be avoided at all costs."}
{"text":"Good enough. The food is a little overpriced for what you actually get, but I like all the TV's. Energetic atmosphere is nice too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BWW to go to. Mike & Jessica are awesome. I love sitting by the bar during happy hour (great deals) & delicious food. They're boneless teriyaki wings are so good omg, to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Wishing we could dine and dash as our waiter is not showing up with the check. Still confused why our appetizer was served as dessert, no napkins and all side dishes came after multiple requests."}
{"text":"Fight night and they are seating family style which is fine, but when we get 2 different rounds of people and the 3 girls in the booth next to us that the manager keeps flirting with get none it's super annoying."}
{"text":"I'm only giving two stars because the service was horrible, but the food was good. Our server Aimee was more concerned with sitting at a table talking about breast implants, loosing 50 lbs and drinking a half bottle of wine the night before. When I saw the manager walking towards her I was hoping that she was gonna tell her to check on her tables, but no she sat down and joined in on the conversation. We definitely would've stayed longer to enjoy happy hour unfortunately it was impossible to get any service."}
{"text":"Only reason i'm giving them 3 stars is because of the good food. The customer service sucks PLUS they had me on hold for at least 10mins before i could even place my order. I get it I shouldn't have called on their discount days but all the employees they hire and they only have 1 line open for pick-up orders? smh"}
{"text":"We have visited several different BWW restaurants, but this one is by far is my favorite in the north valley.  The wait staff is very friendly and the lady going table to table (I think she called herself an \"experience supervisor\") was great fun.  She brought all of the sauces they offer and some french fries to our table so we could sample the different tastes.  It was a lot of fun and also gave you an idea of something new to try on your next visit which I appreciate because I've been curious about some of the flavors in the past, but didn't want to screw up my entire order of wings with the wrong sauce. My family ordered pretzel and cheese appetizers and they were gone incredibly fast! My son had nachos and the chips were crisp and fresh - yes, nachos are a very basic thing, but how often have you been let down by a nasty corn chip?  Not here.  My daughter had a pulled pork sandwich with sweet bbq sauce on it and she really enjoyed it.  She said it was very tender and sweet.  I ordered traditional wings in medium sauce (very generic!) and they were crisp, meaty and well-sauced.  The other adult with us ordered boneless wings and said they were very meaty and cooked just right.  The table shared a basket of buffalo chips which are always delicious and there was no shortage of celery or carrots either. BWW offered a great experience for the family as well as plenty of huge televisions to keep an eye on any game you may be following.  This location has terrific accessibility in the Norterra area and is close to plenty of shopping and movie theaters."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! My party and I have been waiting to be seated for over 2 hours. This has happened to us several times. Customer service is terrible and no on staff supervisor has done anything about it. They said and I quote, \"we need to wait for people to get up but we cannot stop people from being seated.\" Four stars for food, zero stars for service. Do not plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Couple things irritated me, how are you gonna have appetizers the same price as a meal? Not only that my meal was a salad and looked like a side salad. I had to wait for a fork to eat my salad that sat in front of me for 5 mins, and not only are the owners greedy but the waiters are too. The change was $6.68 and she only gave us $6. No big deal because we were gonna give it to her the change anyway...but she basically thought it was ok to take it for herself. Overall won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"We had some time to kill before our flight home to Vancouver so we stopped in here for some wings and beer on NFL Sunday.   They had many TV's with games on so it was great! Service was quick and attentive. They have many flavour selections for wings and you can even try the sauces before you order. We has the Thai wings and some beer to wash it down.  Very tasty wings and great friendly service. Would definitely recommend stopping in for a bite."}
{"text":"I tried to call and was put on hold for over 20 minutes. I wanted to order wings to go on my lunch break to bring back to work. I was on hold the whole time while driving there and eventually just had to order when I got there because the lady still didn't pick up the phone when she left me on hold.  I can understand you're busy, but what really ticks me off is that there are other servers and other employees just moseying around while this poor girl up front is hustling and working her butt off without any help. Management needs to fix this."}
{"text":"Omg, love the Thai Curry Wings!  The servers are always awesome!  Prices are ok, but go on Tuesdays if you want the special.  This place is always jam packed but surprisingly the did always comes out fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Service here is absolutely terrible! We always get a waiter that is slow. My hubby and I always have to wait on our refills for 20min. They don't bring us napkins , and they Rush us with paying the bill. If there was another location closer, we would go there instead. They need to hire new employees."}
{"text":"Good Happy Hour specials. Draft $3 domestic , $4 and $5 draft import. Half off appetizers and plenty of TV's."}
{"text":"Some slow service at this place. My date And I were there about an hour before the food came out. Wings were OK, though.  I don't understand how a national chain could be so dirty. The table had sticky junk on the bottom edges. The carpet and tile floors in the restaurant  were stained. Finally, the men's room had cobwebs in the corners and everything that could be dusty was."}
{"text":"I steadily get good service at Buffalo Wild Wings, and I am the type to complain on yelp about bad service.  My partner and I go almost weekly... we are THAT addicted to their wings and the atmosphere.  It has this great sports bar feel without the cheesy \"greasy-beer-drinking-obnoxious man\" feel. (I know... confusing... but that's the ONLY way I can think of how to describe it)  We tend to go during the week and Arturo is usually our server.  He ALWAYS remembers what we want, what kind of beer we have... and has the beers on order before he even comes to the table. (yes, we don't change it up much)  He can usually guess what wings we want... and every now and then we change something just to keep him on his toes. :-)  If you like wings... this is a great place.    If you want fast food, do not go here.  They do get busy, especially during football, so be patient.  The servers are apologetic when they know they have taken a lot of time, but they do try their best to get to you quickly.  If you pay attention, you know when a server is just slacking off, and these guys aren't slacking off... trust me... I have watched.  If you want good atmosphere, good wings, good beer and nice servers and managers, come here."}
{"text":"Food was standard for a BW3. The consistent comments on slow, poor service  are spot on. I waited at a table by myself for ten minutes before a server said hi. There were at least four of them walking past my table several times. Food came out fast. Waitress never came back until after I was done for five + minutes. Will eat fast food next time if nothing else is open. FYI a double Makers Mark is $9.50. Same price as many nice, white tablecloth places."}
{"text":"I don't care if anyone else gives this less than 5 stars because I freakin' love it!  Their Asian Zing boneless wings are what my Happy Hour dreams are made of.  They have great seasonal beers on tap throughout the year as well.  I'm a huge fan of their buffalo chips as well with chipotle dry seasoning...but ask for them well well well done, or they'll come out super soggy.  Mmmmmmmm.  I wish it wasn't so loud in there, but it is the best place to go for Happy Hour on Fridays.  Ask for Chris...he is my favorite waiter there by far.  Most of the them are great, but I have had to deal with one who came to our table once and then took way too long to come back and get our order or bring our food.  My other complaint, that won't stop me from coming, is their hostess stand.  You could stand there for hours with 2 hostesses right in front of you and not be acknowledged...not even a, \"We'll be with you in a second.\"  Nothing.  Most of the time I just bypass them now and tell them I'm going to the bar and listen to them stammer as I leave them in my dust."}
{"text":"Service , there is literally more than enough people working to serve each person in each party , yet service slacks , a lot , not sure if this Buffalo Wild Wings or a place for employees just to hang out , chat and text , I wish I got paid for that . Customer service is everything . Any ways , food is good , great place to drink , cool happy hour from beer to appetizers , lots of TVs , perfect for football season"}
{"text":"Plus: lot of TVs, show boxing and UFC fights in addition to other sports, multiple \"wings\" options  Minus: staff, service, quality of food  We went to BWW to see a UFC fight since this was one of the closest places for us in University Circle. We walked in and were greeted by a semi-polite staff member who told us to sit wherever we wanted and that they would show the UFC fight once it was time! Ok, we pick a seat and within 2 seconds our server comes to the table and asks us what we want...\"water for now, give us a minute to decide\" we said since it was literally seconds since we sat down. She follows that up with a rude \"is that all.\" Never mind, we wanted to focus on the fight since we are a bunch of enthusiasts so we let it slide. After that poof.... Our server is MIA.  After 10 minutes of scanning the room we finally flag her down to give our drink order while simultaneously attempt to order some food lest we lose her again.   The ordering portion was extremely unpleasant as she kept interrupting my friend whose English is not perfect. Give him a chance to say what he has to!  He was trying to see if he could  customize the sampler plate but Our server was in no mood to help him and retorted \"they don't allow us to change anything in the sampler, do you want it or not.\"   Finally,We gave up and just ordered what was on the menu.  In 5 minutes we get our drinks and in another 15 minutes our food. Since we had requested the mozzarella sticks to be separate from the meat/nachos at the time of our order and since that was not the case when our food arrived,another server offered to get us a new plate of mozzarella sticks. So she goes to do so and on the way mentions it to our server, but she didn't come back to say anything (like it never happened). Ok, it might not have been your fault but at least you can acknowledge the mistake.  We ate, drank and our server dropped the check: she never asked us if we were done, and there was still an hour left for the fight. So lady, if I want more drinks should I just get them at the bar?   Overall, the nachos and mozzarella sticks were decent, wings felt a little cold.   I still appreciate the staff coming us with another plate of mozzarella sticks due to the mistake in the kitchen. However, the remaining service experience was sub-par. Like other yelpers have said, it's kind of a hit and miss so don't expect a lot.  You get drinks, ok food and multiple TVs to watch all the sports you wish to watch."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Buffalo Wild Wings. And, I was pretty impressed, mostly with the staff, due to what time/day we chose to try this venue.   We knew it would be packed right after the game, being next to the stadium & a venue that offers classic sports food w/ beer & a full bar. The line was VERY long to be seated, & the hostess could not \"quote\" a specific wait time- this made some potential customers angry, but I used to work in the hospitality service and totally understand why they don't want to get yelled at for quoting a wait time and a customer may end up hanging out longer to finish watching one of the MANY games on one of their MANY screens.   I have to hand it to ALL of the wait staff & hostess. Absolutely every single one of them were very friendly and very attentive. They checked on all of their tables (even tables that were not their own) quite often. The wait time, even with a long line, was still pretty quick to be in & seated. Drinks came out promptly, and food took less than 30 minutes even with such a huge crowd and busy time of the evening. We were literally in & out in about an hour or so of arriving, so we were pretty impressed with how smoothly they were running the gig.   I don't really want to complain or ding them for a cleanly atmosphere when it is more than understandable that the floors are going to have debris & bathrooms are going to be a bit less than spotless during such a busy time of the evening right at the post-game rush, especially since this venue is right next to the stadium.  The only thing we found a bit frustrating, was the menu. (And, my drink was pretty weak for an alcoholic beverage that was priced pretty steep but was majority tonic water.) We had to actually kind of have our waitress stand there & walk us through the menu because it was not very clear. And she even admitted her frustration with it, because apparently this menu is new and re-vamped. BUT, whomever re-vamped it left out some pretty critical information!   Most go to BWW for the wings. Well, their menu only gives you the option of: small, medium, large for an order. It does not state HOW many wings come with each size. So you have no idea what you are getting for what you are paying... will it be enough or too little? Can you share a certain size with two or more people?? And while they have an AWESOME selection of flavors (that absolutely tops Native Grill & Wings any day!) their menu also does not specify how many different flavors (out of the 20+ to choose from) that you are allows to select per order size. We felt bad that the waitress had to sit there and go over in detail what the menu was missing in information before ordering. So, I really hope they can fix this new menu to include that basic information that would make ordering much more easy!   But as far as the wings go- OUTSTANDING! Hands-down, BWW has wings that are far beyond what Native Grill & Wings could even try to compete with. They are not only priced better, with more flavor & meat on the bones, but those flavors & the quality are just fantastic! We split a large order between the two of us, containing the garlic Parmesan, Caribbean jerk, teriyaki & dry rub chipotle bbq... that was 20 wings worth and plenty for two! And they were perfect! Perfect amount of flavor and the wings were not at all weak- decent amount of meat on those bones. The only thing that was weak was the drinks from the bar. I'm almost questioning if there even was alcohol in my tonic water...   But, hands-down, I will go to BWW over Native ANY day! They really have the best wings and their sauces/dry rubs are outstanding. Well worth the outing & expense. And the attentive staff just made the experience all the better. I give them props at doing a great job during such a busy rush. Not bad at all for a first visit during a chaotic time right after the big game!"}
{"text":"Wings and Beer are my PB & J.....they just go together.  This is another restuarant I discovered in the midwest and was glad to find one in Arizona.  The food is great, reasonably priced (35 cent wings on Tuesdays) with beer specials to boot.    It is a great place to watch sporting events, but can become very crowded for boxing and UFC.  So it is best to arrive early!"}
{"text":"Love you Buffalo Wild Wings , especially this location . We've always had great service. Wings come out just how we want em. No complaints . Till today. We sat at the bar and my mother in law joined us shortly after. But since she had just got off work she didn't bring her id due to the fact that she doesn't even drive. So we got moved from the bar to a booth & she couldn't order a beer even though she looks well over 21. Just a buzz kill ."}
{"text":"Worst one I've been to. Dolt hostess. Waitress tried but just doesn't have it. Hardly ever around. Kitchen was sooooo slow, even a light night. Wings and sauce average. Selection ok."}
{"text":"Asian zing is the best. Tuesday night is 45 cent wings. My wife and I order 10 wings of 4 different flavors and take home what we don't eat."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  The food was ok, the service was ok, the prices are horrible.  You can eat much healthier at a nicer restaurant for about the same cost, without the fried food dysentery.  $50 for a couple dozen chicken wings, cheese fries and a couple of beers is just dumb.  I guess they have to pay for all that advertising.  REVISITED:  I originally gave this place a 2star and just changed it to a 1star.  My sister bought home some leftovers and our rescued dog wouldn't eat it."}
{"text":"This was the worst food experience I've had since I moved to Scottsdale. We walk in and the host handed us menus and silverware and told us to seat ourselves to \"save him the trip\"... already off to a rude start. Every waitress looked like they just rolled out of bed and didn't know which tables were theirs. Our food was cold, soggy and took ages to come out. Absolute garbage. The only thing that want horrible was the beer. Definitely come here if you love microwaved food and terrible service"}
{"text":"Normally I'm not one to complain but I was shocked with this service. First things first the wings I ordered were made with no effort . I ordered both dry rub and wet rub wings that had barely any sauce on them to begin with. Then the onion rings I ordered were far from onion rings. They served me onion rings that were the peeling of the onion, not the actual onion inside. Then to make matters even worse when I asked to speak with the manager, he informed me that he was sorry but it was not their fault and that all of their food with the exception of the original hot wings are frozen and re heated showing little empathy. He did refund me for the $6 worth for maybe all of the 5 frozen onion rings I received which I thought was nice however I will never be going to Buffalo Wild Wings ever again after learning their food is just re heated frozen food. If I wanted cheap frozen wings and tasteless side dishes I would go to the grocery store and receive better quality."}
{"text":"Walked in the owner was painting walls and smelt HORRIBLE. The staff nice. The manager or owner walked around asking if we were enjoying the meal. The wings and the sauce was pretty .... gross. Me and my friend did NOT like it. The honey garlic was just honey.... and I don't like the wings not battered. The place smelt really bad. Idk if it was the paint or what they use to clean but it was like hard vinegar, the drinks are super expensive as well.... definitely not going back"}
{"text":"BW3 as i will always know and call it, does wings and most everything else right.  I always get my wings extra crispy and with Wild sauce, they never disappoint.    My ONLY complaint, this is a minor one....they are rolling out a new sauce every month or so for the past year and the one i really wanted to try, the ghost pepper, was sold out with seemingly no hope of returning before i even had a chance to try it!"}
{"text":"The waitress was really sweet.  That's really the only reason I don't give this place 1 star.  I also liked that they let you try sauces before deciding.  However, the cheeseburger was literally burnt on one side, and super thin.  I guess when you go here, you should stick to the wings."}
{"text":"we came here after having a really great experience at another wing place and hoping to be able to compare/contrast... and the clear winner is NOT bw3.  first, we waited close to 15 minutes for someone to even approach the table to get drink orders.  we selected our wings and the veggie boat but we weren't informed that veggies come with the wings, so we had a ton of veggies... and not enough ranch for 3 orders of wings and 2 loads of veggies. we could have asked for more if the waitress ever came back. we sat there for another 10-15 after finishing eating waiting for our server to return. when she did, she then had to go back to get the check. another 10 minutes. after giving her the credit card she just didn't return to the table. we eventually hunted her down and she said \"oh, i thought you left\" even though she still had our card and we never signed the check. not a single apology from her. seriously, the worst service i have ever had.  oh, and the \"hot bbq sauce\" is barely zingy (expecting a mouth of fire since there are only a few ranked hotter than that). it's more like tabasco + mild bbq sauce.  epic fail. will not return."}
{"text":"I came here to watch the St. Louis blues play and with in seconds of me sitting down one of the managers came up to me and said the game would be on the big tv directly infront of me, without me having to ask at all."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. This guy working the graveyard shift on September 18th, at 5:45am tells us he was better before we got there. Is this guy for real! White guy that needs to shave. Graveyard bartender is HORRIBLE. We just left. We'll take our money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Crap service, they know its packed so they don't even try, I'd give it a zero star if I could."}
{"text":"My wife and I at at this place by Metro North Mall with some of her work colleagues.  We expected the food to be pretty bad and that she would have little choice as she is a vegan but we were really only there for the company.  It didn't start out well when they were out of Cabernet, but no big deal.  We weren't expecting anything that would be reviewed in Wine Spectator.  The only things on the menu that she would consider eating was the french fries until she learned they were fried in the same oil as the chicken and bacon.  The server offered to have the chicken left off of a salad for her and that is what she ordered.  As he took orders from the rest of the table he was conscientious to point out that anything other than standard menu items would be an extra charge.  After we ate some rather dreadful stuff and an incredibly banal salad we received the bill and I paid.  As we were getting ready to leave the thought occurred to me that if they charge  for some extra peppers they should probably have given us a discount for leaving off the chicken.  I checked my ticket and discovered we had paid full price of $11.95 for what was effectively a side salad with three olives which made it Mediterranean.  I asked the server about this and he agreed we should not have to pay full price and went to talk to the manager.   When he came back he informed me that the menu was as-is and there would be no discount.  Unfortunately I cannot give them less than one star because that is what this awful money-grubbing miserable chain outlet deserves."}
{"text":"We have now been sitting here for 17 minutes and no one has even greeted us at the table.  Several waitstaff have walked by our table, which is right in the middle of the dining room and continue to be completely ignored. It has now been 20 minutes since we were seated. Five more minutes and I am walking out. It's not that busy that the service should be so slow."}
{"text":"Good food but, extremely dirty restroom. Also, excessively loud music playing overhead in the restroom."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience! Service was wretched. Spent 90+ minutes there. Told them of my Gluten Allergy. Took 35 minutes to put my order in. I ordered the Boneless Chicken tenders and a salad. After 15 minutes I was looking for my salad because I wanted it before my food. The Manager caught my eye and brought it right out.  The Salad Dressing was horrible. I pushed the salad aside. When I finally got my food? It was like Jerky. NEVER GOING BACK. NEVER got a refill or nothing. When the check came? Oh Yeah! I was charged $4.95 for a salad I never ate and I ate the fries. No one told me that there might be Cross Contamination with my Gluten Allergy. I spent the next 4 hours in the bathroom sick as a dog that drank radiator fluid! NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced for what you get when it comes to the wings, but it has an upbeat atmosphere and if you need a quick beer and wings fix it may be worth your time if you don't mind spending the bucks for minimal return."}
{"text":"I returned here with my parents on a Sunday night because they wanted to watch a football game. I've been told multiple times, \"What do you expect? It's bar food!\" with regard to places like Buffalo Wild Wings, but I was newly disappointed on this occasion.   Our server was pleasant but seemed not to be able to answer questions directly, which was moderately annoying. It's been a few days and I was very tired, so I don't remember what question was asked, but I do remember that moment being one where I had to re-ask the question to get answer. It was also pretty dead in there and it took a long while for our food to arrive.  With regard to the food, my father ordered the popcorn shrimp as an appetizer. It was ok, but pretty bland. Basically deep fried shrimp. The sauce alongside it was especially mediocre; barely even cocktail sauce with no spice to it. I ordered as an entree the shrimp po'boy. Now this dish was a complete disappointment. Basically, it's the popcorn shrimp inside of a bun with some vegetables and a creamy mayonnaise.   I know I'll be dragged back here by my parents, but I will attempt to avoid this place until then. I honestly hope this location closes and a local business takes over. Expansion for the Fairmount or Luna? That would be awesome."}
{"text":"I would give this location a negative 4 if it were possible. Worst dining experience I've had in recent years... even worse than Chinatown to give you a feel of how bad it was. Wings were cold and Mac and cheese watery. Our waiter came around once... Aka when we got there & ordered... Even then, we had to wait for a while for someone to get us set up with drinks and starters. Bunch of (teen) workers just walking around and socializing at the bar or in the corner to avoid customers, just plain doing nothing. Even worse, we were sitting at the very center by the bar, so servers were constantly passing. Even the manager walked past several times. We wanted refills and were going to place extra orders, but lost our appetite once we finally were able to flag down our actual server!! We politely asked another server if we could get refills from her and she said she would look for our original server... took forever and two days for that, too. Point blank, unless you're sitting right at the bar table, you can just forget about timely and efficient service. It wasn't even a full house, so I didn't understand what the disconnect was. AVOID THIS location at all costs... Take your money to the Galleria or Belz location. Heck, right before BWW on Craig, you're better off at Famous Dave's nearby! :))"}
{"text":"The food is good! Though the chairs are not too comfortable if you stay on the booth the people pass by a lot! Suggest not to stay on the side if you really want to watch the game and not get dizzy!"}
{"text":"The worst EVER!! Our little guy really wanted BWW so we came to this location. There were far more servers than customers. We were seated and easily 15 minutes later, NOBODY even so much as came over to us at all while we watched table after table being served. After reaching our level of insult, we prepared to leave but spoke to the manager first. The manager seemed less than concerned and offered a less than sincere apology accompanied by the excuse that a shift change was going on. However, the number of servers NEVER changed. At no time did the manager take ownership of the problem nor ever offer to have staff promptly take our order. Our son was beyond disappointed. If l could give ZERO stars I would. Please do not attempt to contact me regarding this experience. Nothing that can be said will change anything nor are we interested in any sort of coupons, discounts etc."}
{"text":"The avon eagles football team were graciously taken care of by bdubs. They provided excellent service to well over 1 hundred young men their food is outstanding and they were very attentive to some rowdy young men. My hats off to an establishment that can handle a rambunctious crowd feed them with great food and atend to other diners this place is now going to be my go to wing dinger cuz nobody i know or any restaurant can candle this and they did it with ease. Thank you"}
{"text":"I had dinner here this evening (Tuesday July 9, 2013).  I had cold wings and warm beer.  I mentioned my issues to the manager on the way out and he acted like I was asking him the square root of a made up number.  To add insult to injury, my boneless wings were less like wings, or even nuggets, more like crumbs and they cost $8!!!"}
{"text":"Best thing happened: half off traditional wings on Tuesday! It was the greatest thing! I got myself spicy garlic which was delicious! My boyfriend ordered hot and wild; he wasn't too much a fan of wild. For dessert we got the cheesecake bites with caramel sauce and the sundae. Everything was great and reasonably priced! A great setting to meet with friends."}
{"text":"Food is generally good. A nice selection of sauces. Although the medium sauces tend to be more on the hot side in my opinion. The wait staff, though, is hit and miss. They aren't always as attentive as they should be. You shouldn't have to consistently wave them down to get drink refills. And the waitress delivering the food from the back; a bit of an attitude. Bad Night?!"}
{"text":"I come here really often and i usually have a small problem whether its having to go up to them to ask for drink refils. But today they didnt make my day any better with such bad service i got from the manager. Not even an appolgy or any way to get me to stay. They obvioulsy didnt care for a regular. I  will try to stay from this location."}
{"text":"The three of us had a nice time munching on some chicken and getting sensory overload, all the while feeding my self diagnosed ADD.   BWW is still the place for chicken. Yeah, and some beer too. We were so happy that the corporate suits decided to give north Scottsdale another try, after closing the location up on Mayo, near the 101.   This location is convenient and has ample parking now that Miracle Mile closed. Actually, even when the place is packed on a Saturday or Sunday game day, there's only a small wait.   I could try and compare some of the other chicken places, like that orange and white hot pants place. But we come here for some of the best chicken and beer, with HDTVs everywhere and that sensory overload you just can't get anywhere else. I love it.   Three and a half stars, A-Okay!"}
{"text":"I'm very sad to say, that this BW's did not live up to my usual standards.  The restaurant is great, lots of TVs and plenty of room.  However, the bar side needs help.  Especially with the bartending.  They were rude, slow and it took me forever to get a beer...I was playing video poker, should've had comped beers.  But, the bartender charged me.  When I asked why, he then proceeded to tell the whole bar how much I spent gambling and how that was only worth the amount of free drinks he had already comped.  Then, he stomped off muttering something about stupid corporate rules.  Unprofessional.  I love the BW's franchise restaurants, but this one needs some TLC."}
{"text":"This is my regular hangout and there's a reason why.  The staff is great, I've never had bad service, whether I'm in the bar or restaurant side.  Their selection of beer has something for everyone, they've recently added lots of new microbrews for you beer snobs.   I can always watch my favorite teams play, the staff is very accomodating to let everyone get to see the game they want to see.  Plenty of TVs so everyone has a good seat for the games. The food is always hot, fresh and tasty...I love the boneless wings and corn dogs!"}
{"text":"Utterly disgusting !!!! They hype up this place too much AND my chicken was RAW !!! Never returning again, RATHER GO TO NAPOLI PIZZA FOR WINGS"}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch on Veterans Day, had probably the worst service I've ever had and I frequent Buffalo Wild Wings quite often. I'm still currently waiting for my food and it's been almost an hour. We had to change our order to go because we had to get back to work. Just received our food and they got half of our order wrong. But we don't have any more time to sit around and wait, management was apologetic but the bartender couldn't get our drink order of a Pepsi and Dr. Pepper right. NEVER coming here again and I work less than 5 miles away"}
{"text":"After going there 3 times we will go back but will never, ever get anything except the wings (better than average) and beer (good selection). The burger was awful (frozen, completely unseasoned, hard to chew!, and with an off taste), the \"southwest philly\" sandwich was worse (tasteless and mushy), the (frozen) onion rings were crisp but the onions themselves were total mush. Fries were average. Fried pickles, so so. Cheese curds the same. Stick with the wings and beer.  Sit at the bar (the bartenders have been great, but don't even think about a mixed drink or wine)."}
{"text":"All right, I have added another star. I went back, almost a year after my first review, and I decided to get their Thursday wing thing. I forgot about football (when I was a kid it was on Friday nights... and I'm 22), and that comes in later. I have been to a few other locations and they were far better, a solid 3 stars, or a stolid 4 (meaning dull or apathetic. It's only funny because I'm two beers in). We go, sit down and ask for split checks. I ask for a beer, order the tablegating sampler, and 12 boneless wings all at the same time. Waitress plops my beer in front of my boyfriend and runs off. I have no issue buying him a beer, but he's driving and paranoid about BAC. I'd gotten a PBR because it it's ok from the tap and it has been from all other BWW I'd gone to. Not here though, and when you bring someone a beer in a can, bring them a damn glass, too! Normally I'd have asked for one, but at that point I could tell the night was going downhill fast and I did not want to be sober for it (I'm a calm drunk and a sober bitch) so I chugged it. She came back in 15 mins with the sampler and, once again, ran away. The cheese sauce tasted like nacho cheese fries, but not the good ones. It tasted like Hormel chili and Campbell's cheese soup, which was a real shame since the pretzels were good. There wasn't any mustard on the table so we ate them plain. The chips were fried there, but they used really thick tortillas so they were a bit chewy. The \"artichoke\" and spinach dip was green. The sauce was lime green, and there was no discernible bit of artichoke in it. The jalapeno poppers were made with sharp cheddar. Anyway, we finished that and it took another 15 mins to get there rest of our wings out. I ordered another beer and she asked to see my id, and I then pointed out that I ordered and drank the beer on the table at which point she said she thought that had been my boyfriend... Her knowledge of the beer was lacking, to the point where she had to come back and tell me (another 15 minutes later...) that they were out of it. We had to ask for a water refill (Desert. Water. Hmmm... why would I want water?) Anyway, we got the food, and by some miracle my beer showed up with the new wings not even 5 mins after I ordered it. We also discovered what had been added to the cheesy sauce: their Desert Heat spice blend. So we asked for the checks and she brought one. I figured it was time to get out of here before I started losing my buzz, and then everyone started cheering. It's a TV! Stop yelling! And because of the noise I had to try to yell that she had forgotten a pen. I'm not going back to that location.  And who charges $6.50 for a can of PBR??"}
{"text":"Our server Michelle was wonderful, and upon leaving we forgot our leftover box of 20 boneless wings! We only pulled out of the parking lot and drove back in hopes of retrieving them, but they had been tossed. The manager Kathy overheard and ordered up a fresh new box of 20 for us! Wow! Now that's Excellent Customer Service!"}
{"text":"Big, beautiful place that's open 24 hours!   Seated promptly, order taken right away, lots and lots of tabs to entertain you while waiting.   Two of my favorite things about this place:   1. They had hockey on. Usually when there are other games going on, hockey is only on one tv in a sad little corner everywhere else. This place featured it in the big screen.  2. The SHRIMP TACOS! Please don't ever take it away. It's a new feature on their menu and OH MY GAHHHH, so good!   Two things I absolutely hated:  1. Our waitress sucked. She was serving the two other tables seated behind me and she kept sitting down in one of the booths to flirt with her bf IN THE MIDDLE OF HER SHIFT! My friend waited 10 mins for her ranch because we couldn't get her attention. I forgot her name but she was this petite girl with a Hawaiian like name. Blonde/brunette hair.  2. The table and booth we sat in was sticky. The utensils had water marks and they're stingy on water. Terrible!"}
{"text":"It's been a minute since my bf and I went to Bdubbs for some chicken. Tonight is Valentines so I thought this place would be a little bit more packed but they accommodated us right when we walked in the door.   I usually order the snack size (bone in special on Tuesdays/boneless on thursdays) which consists of 5 pieces drenched in Asian Zing sauce. It kinda tastes like that Asian sweet chili sauce which I like because it's close to the taste of home. I also order the roasted garlic mushrooms which is my absolute favorite and onion rings when I'm being a fatty. It comes with this southwest dipping sauce which I love but don't sell in a bottle. Tonight though, my waitress gave me a to go container with that sauce, extra charge of course.   Service was prompt, and they checked on us often. Lisa (Liza?) even came to chat with me about my obsession with the southwest sauce.   I like this location because it's close to my house although this place is always so cluttered inside. Maybe they just had a large crowd ... who knows. So many TV's playing all sorts of sports. They even have a BDUBS TV."}
{"text":"Customer service is awful, don't bother going. Tried to place a an order for takeout over the phone and was on hold for 20 minutes. Hung up and called back to see why no one was picking up the call. Man on the phone rudely responded saying that there was other people ahead of me. So I hung up.   Compare this location to any others across the country and there is no comparison, it's horrible"}
{"text":"BWW has it's ups and downs. The food is very hit or miss and the service is as well. That said, they do offer fundraisers for local schools and this is what led me to BWW recently. This was definitely an UP visit. The food was served hot, was tasty, and our server was polite and competent. I had the Chicken Buffalitos which were delish. My son had this sausage burger on a pretzel roll thing that he was stone silent while eating because he liked it so much. My littlest had the corn dogs from the appetizer menu which he loved. We had 1/2 price appetizers as well. Drinks were kept filled, tables bussed. Its the little things but they finally got it done right.  I hope that it's on an UP swing for a while now because I really do want to like it there."}
{"text":"Our family of 4 went to dine. Me and my daughter had Chipotle from across the way- my 3 year old doesn't eat anything there and I wanted a salad when I looked at the Buffalo Wings menu online there were very little options. But the boys wanted wings.  My husband ordered and I joined them with the food for just me and my daughter and once we got situated the manager came over and kicked us out. Really? Our Chipotle threatens your business? We've never had this happen in other restaurants.   If it's a liability issue it could have been explained and handled so much better.  But no just told no outside food and you'll have to leave.  We'll take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"IDIOCRACY comes to life. If you've seen the movie you know what to expect here. I don't expect much, just to pick up an order that matches what I entered and they printed out, pulled sides from stock and allegedly checked before charging me a fortune for wings. This place has succeeded exactly zero times in 3 attempts.  Either way, I'm done with this joke of an establishment - not that it matters - it was packed. Crappy food and service are the norm these days.  Apparently ordering buffalo wings from BWW at this location AND getting what you order is not humanly possible. Bummer...maybe replacing these idiots with robots is the way to go. Sad..."}
{"text":"What a crappy menu.  They don't tell you how many wings and how many sauces you get with each size of order.  Took us forever and pissing off the waitress to figure out our order.  The snack size of the boneless wings has 8 wings and you can choose 2 sauces, the snack size of the bone-in wings has six wings and one sauce. They act like you should just know how it works.  Also,  traditional wings are more restrictive and more expensive than boneless, which in my experience is backwards.  It is also insanely loud in the place.  On top of it they charge almost $5 for the weakest, wilted little side salad.  Also, they bring 10 wings in a small order, plus carrots and celery, with an Itty bitty 2 oz. Of ranch.  Then they want $0.60 for each 2 oz. Thereafter.  They can keep it!  $38 for two for wings and mediocre fries.  $45 after tip.  Ugh..."}
{"text":"Great beer and sports most of the time good not great wings on wing Thursday but some great sauces that are to die for"}
{"text":"Dirty out front .. empty cups and straws, rotting fruit on the ground outside the door. A lot of trash. This place is gross. Checking in and they actually told me I could \"stand next to your booth if it's dirty and they will come wipe it off.\" Uhmmm .. I don't think that's the way it's supposed to work!  So I would've left already .. actually I would've never made it in the door after seeing all the trash out front, but others in our party are determined to eat the wings. Don't ask me why. Chili's wings are just as good if not better. Barro's are delicious too.   Trash on the floor in the dining area. And we had to sweep the chairs off before we sat down. Dirty."}
{"text":"I went on a weekend night, arrived at 6:30pm, party of 2, and was told my wait was going to be 40 minutes. At 10:00pm I still was not seated. Jasmine and Dante lost the list and were seating other parties who had arrived around 9pm. At 9:45pm Dante asked for my name and said I was not on the list and got stuck at the end. I was furious at this point. I had to at least ask for water since these two individuals are not even trained in service hospitality.  Spoke with Todd. I hope management trains individuals to offer water or soda to people waiting for such a long period of time. So BWW loses a couple of $$ on water/soda but it keeps people from leaving and return customers. Real upset at the incompetence of Dante and Jasmine for losing a list. Even more upset that I am a regular on slow nights and was treated like this, who could NOT seem to try and seat for a party of 2 in under 2 hours, let alone almost 4. Totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"Worst cocktails ever.  Get a beer and the pulled pork sliders and you'll be OK.  Cocktails suck - makes TGIFridays look high class.  Mojito was like a giant class of sugar water and completely no taste of rum.  My friend had similar thoughts on one of the punch drinks.  French fries were pretty awful as well.  Hmm.  That's what I get for going into a sports bar."}
{"text":"Great stop on our vacation to watch football. Manager Dave was very helpful in getting our game on. Food is always tasty."}
{"text":"Lots of TVs. Food is pretty good quality, except the Nachos, they don't use real cheese. Have really only had the wings and appetizers which we're all pretty good. Can get full if there is a big event going on even through the place is big."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been in here a couple of times and both times had the same bartender taking  care of us. Not only did he have great recommendations but also just great over all service. This yelp is 100% service related being a bartender myself it's always refreshing receiving great service when I dine out. Buffalo Wild Wings you did a great job when you hired Kyle and because of him we will be in more often!"}
{"text":"Always a great time when the wife and I come here. We always have s blast - beer , margarita and food !!! The atmosphere is always great, Service is great and good always great."}
{"text":"Good location, always busy, decent parking, and food is 100 time better than the Hooters that is literally across the street.  The food is always good.  Warning to the pregnant ladies: Some of the wing sauces that may not bother you before you were pregnant, will set off the morning sickness just by smell alone. Use caution!!!"}
{"text":"Typical Buffalo Wild Wings, really awesome beer and wing selection, tons of tvs to watch sporting events. The bartender said he been there awhile you could tell because he was very good at suggestions on wing flavours"}
{"text":"Second time coming in to this buffalo wings and no one has acknowledged my presence as I came in for my pick up. Servers and hostess all were standing around and chit chatting. I really hope this changes the third time I come in"}
{"text":"Everything we had to eat was terrible except for the salad and tea. The service was even worse. First and last time coming here. I'm only giving it 1 star because I have to."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of going during the Final Four, so perhaps in another place and time I would give higher rating. Not sure if it will ever happen.   So the bar area is first come/first served for high top tables. However, it was without any rules. Two tables for six were being used by parties of two while we were at a tiny table where our food did not easily fit for the four of us. And we were not eating like teenagers--each had an entree and we shared an appetizer.  The waitress was spot on with her description of one wing sauce we inquired about, but otherwise, really missed everything else. Asked if we wanted bleu/ranch/both with wings. The clear answer from everyone who wanted sauce was ranch only. We got 50/50.  Asked if everyone wanted celery/carrots. Resounding YES. Two of us got them, two of us did not.   Gave one diner an order and said it was Salt and Vinegar wings. I clarified that she had ordered Lemon Pepper.  She responded that they looked the same and was sure they were the right flavor. Why not just say the right flavor...and FTR, no one got the salt and vinegar at our table so it wasn't a mix up of the order of seating vs. what she'd written down.   We waited a REALLY long time, like check my watch and figure out at what point I say something amount of time. Now I do recognize that with many people there things can be slower, but no apology and no recognition of the delay. How hard is it to just say 'I am sorry for the delay'?"}
{"text":"Always great wings.  The service at times is a bit rough...but the food is outstanding.  Try the salt n vinegar wings with a side of hot."}
{"text":"i had there normal hot wings and thought they were great. i caught the happy hour which is actually 2 hours and i was pleasently surprised. they have alot of beers on tap and the bartender was very knowledgeable. i thought the wings were a little expensive but tasted excellent. one thing i really liked was they offer wet naps with wings."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Wife ordered a Buffalo Salad. When food was brought out, her salad was no where to be seen. Server came back 5 mins later \"I don't know what's going on back there, the manager is trying to figure it out..\"  Three kids had finished meal, I decided to eat mine (macaroni and cheese was super dry and below average at best) And the server came over after meals were done and said the manager is trying to figure it out....(wife's salad.)  It really isn't that hard. Finally after dinner is done the manager comes over and said sorry and that he would see about taking off the salad (you think?) and walks away. After he walks away, the salad shows up (along with my side salad I had ordered....  We ended up having our dinners/salads taken care of but it was just a terrible experience. All around. The server badmouthing the back of the house, the salad not coming out till we were leaving, no refills on drinks, slow service, and manager acting like he didn't care.   I will never ever be back."}
{"text":"You only have one life to live...get the cheesecake bites.  On second thought, you deserve it, get two orders.  I really love the bar here and the wings are great too!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  The place was not even that busy for a Saturday night.  Empty tables and booths everywhere.  When we asked for a booth...they said 10 minutes.  Then we get this male waiter that was horrible.  We had to ask other waitresses to get us things because our waiter was horrible.  Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"Late review-I came here last tuesday for dinner..49 cent wings today. Looking over the menu I know that I usually get asian zing,and mild but I wanted to try something diffrent today.So I decided to get hot garlic wings,mild wings,basket of buffalo chips, onion rings,and ofcourse ranch dressing. Also I asked for a sample of wild,and blazzen  Onion rings-beer batteerd good but normal Mild-spicy but not to hot just nice :) Hot garlic-I could put this on just about anything thats how good this shit is,spicy and garlicy its frecen amazing!   The manager also came out and asked if our food was good.I told her how much I liked the garlic sause and she agreed saying she loved it so much :)I'm not sure why everyone over all complains about this location I think its always been good."}
{"text":"We love coming to this Buffalo Wild Wings on Hualapai between Flamingo and Tropicana.  Not only do they play all of the games with the sound, but they have a great happy hour as well ($3.75 for a tall Bud Light) as well as food specials. It's really nice to be able to invite guests with children to watch the games in a lively setting with TV's everywhere.  Most restaurants do not have all Of the games on in the dining room, usually only the bar area, which is off limits to kids.  The service at this location is good, especially for how busy it gets, and the food is what is to be expected from a wing and beer spot.  This location is also a short drive from Summerlin, which makes it a convenient stop for those living in this area."}
{"text":"I'm back! We'd been disappointed the last couple years at BW3s in general, but 2 visits in 3 weeks with great meals & staff? We are Fans!! The Husband enjoed his dry rub wings & a salad, keeps his blood sugar in check & I had the Shrimp Po'Bo & cheese curds. They kindly made my sandwich a wrap instead, very tasty. LOVED our server Derek, who handled my odd assortment of family with particular dining/food needs with grace & good humor. The best margarita I've had in several months, too. Really glad we gave them a new look."}
{"text":"We have had a couple of issues with this BWW but there is not excuse for hair in your food! There is nothing more disgusting than stuff in your food that doesn't belong there. Hopefully they will start making the them wear hair nets cuz that sh!t is nasty!"}
{"text":"Went to this location the other night with my brother to grab a few beers and watch the hockey playoffs (Go Kings!) which lead to a wonderful night.  When it comes to watching any sports game I am always drawn to a Buffalo Wild Wings simply for the atmosphere. And this location certainly has that sports vibe in full effect especially after its latest remodel which I am loving.   As for the food you I've never had a bad experience at this location. Some Buffalo Wild Wings I've visited will haphazardly throw some sauce on and call it a day but that has never been a problem for me at this location. Simply put if you're looking for some wings and a beer this is where you need to be.  As for the service Brandi was the difference between a 4 star review and the 5 stars they are getting from me today. It is easy to work for a corporate entity and an establishment will lose that community neighborhood bar feel very quick. However after being seated in the bar and her checking our IDs she quickly recalled she had waited on us our previous visit. Throughout the visit she was very attentive to the table and ensured beers were full and that food was ordered promptly.   Overall a great experience and wonderful customer service made for an amazing night of beer, wings, and hockey."}
{"text":"Personally I hate this location but sometimes I join others who go to this one. EVERY TIME I order spicy garlic wings it comes out tasting different I have no clue why and that is the reason I hate this location."}
{"text":"Standard BWW. Good beer, good wings, and a good environment. Service is average - we went on the weekend so it was quite busy but our server was still fairly attentive. If you want BWW, you won't be disappointed. If you want a quiet sit down dinner, then you're looking at the wrong place."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to give this place a shot.  It was about 1ish and the place wasn't crowded at all.  They had like a zillion TVs and a interactive video game thingy at every booth which was very neat.  If there was a Buffalo Wild Wings near my house and I was into sports I would definitely stay there for hours to drink, eat and watch games.  So about the food....  Since it is almost the new year and I want to start it off right, I opted out of the typical wings because they are fried and breaded.  I just don't understand why wing places haven't figured out that they can just bake their wings and they will be just as good?  Anyway,  my wife and I each ordered the Naked Tenders and side salads.  The tenders came with whatever sauces you want so we got 5 to try.  My wife didn't like any of them but my favorite was the parmesan garlic.  The spicy garlic wasn't too bad but anything hotter than that was just too hot for us.  We both thought the tenders were very good and simple.  They are also a very healthy option if you don't dip them in too much sauce so I tried not to.  The salad was also pretty good.  The service was pretty fast and friendly so no complaints there.  Though I probably won't be back to this particular location because I am almost never in the area, I will go to another Buffalo Wild Wings in the future to try some other wings and sauces."}
{"text":"It used to be my favorite until the last 3 times I been here the service is extremely slow and rude, took over 40 min to just get some menu's,  and when we did, the waitress (red hair with tattoos) just threw the menu's and left without saying a word!!! will not be coming back here again,management should step up on supervising their employees to make this location a pleasant place to be."}
{"text":"Not one to complain as I understand that people have bad days and something's just don't go right, however, my experience this afternoon was just THAT bad. Horrible customer service and the food may have been OK if we didn't wait 20 minutes for extra plates and the ranch we asked for multiple times, but we did wait that long so the food was as bad as the service. And yes, it wasn't until 20 minutes after we got our food and asked for extra plates and ranch that she asked \"how we were doing.\" (we paid 60 cents for the ranch that took 20 plus minutes to make it to us) I also received my margarita melted and over filled all over the cup and then our table and myself and when we asked for a wet towel to clean up the mess she recommended we use napkins or finger wipes. Not a happy camper and will not be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"the worst buffalo wild wings experience ive ever had in my life. 1. they messed up on my order so hard, it's ridiculous. 2.  the manager gave me an attitude/issue to use my credit that they gave me on giving me my wrong order worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"I am just not a fan of much that I have tried at any of the Buffalo Wild Wings locations.  I guess the best would be some of the alcoholic beverages and the Desert Nachos.  Last weekend I visited the Chandler Mall location.  It feels very small and tight.  The entryway is a bit strange.  Service was very good.  Tried the deep fried pickles.  They were okay but I didn't care for the southwest ranch dipping sauce at all.  Very thick and unpleasant flavor.  Also tried the strawberry limeade.  It was sweet and just not good.  I love limeade and this didn't taste like limeade to me.  I hope I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Went with a huge group so service was a bit slow and inconsistent.  The place was kept super clean either.  Happy hour prices good.    Liked the berry mojito and onion rings.  The dessert nachos has to be the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Finally a place in the GTA that makes a proper, Anchor Bar style Buffalo wing. (sorry haters and Chowsnobs, Duffs did NOT perfect the wing, they ruined it).  Not that disgusting breaded crap soaked with sauce (so the breading turns to mush) like what that poor clone \"Wild Wing\" sells.    If I wanted that gooey garbage I'd go to Mandarin...  I ordered the potato wedges for the side, which was nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, very nice.      I went during lunch when there weren't any live sports to watch on their multiple big screens but I'm sure it's a great place to be in the evening to watch the Raptors games."}
{"text":"This place sucks! It literally took almost an hour to get are wings. We. Talked to the manager he was no help. He didn't care."}
{"text":"We got seated promptly, but where was the waiter? After waiting for ten minutes with no greets, no drink orders, tables beside us not cleaned off... We decided to wait some more. There were a lot of staff around, at the registers, windexing glass, but not one person came to us to help us at all. We decided to leave after sitting there hungry for 15 minutes. Will never come back to this location. The one on Las Vegas Blvd. is the best one."}
{"text":"I don't think I'm BWW lovin as I should. I know a lot of my friends who are loyal to this spot and it is their one and only go to for Wings. I was feeling rebellious and went for the bbq pork grilled cheese. Which was rather different yet still very tasty. It was packed inside the restaurant as i'm sure it usually is. Our waiter was really nice, however it took forever to get the food. He came back twice to tell us still.. not yet. Not sure of the mass appeal of this place. I guess i have more flavors to try and wings to devour. Perhaps it will convert me to a BWW disciple."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here for the playoff game. The atmosphere is always great... But the food is consistently sub-par. It just seems that everything is made from a freezer and thrown in the oven to cook. The last time we went here we had two different waitresses, both of room did an exceptional job with our table. We were given the opportunity to try several different samples in wing sauces that were new to the restaurant. We both enjoyed this experience, even though we did not enjoy the taste of some of the samples. This is a great place to watch the game for sure, and the main reason we decided to go here was due to the atmosphere and the big screens for games. You have to get there super early if you're there for a game, otherwise you will be parking at the hall across the street.  They really didn't have any game day specials either. For a Sunday afternoon I was expecting something more the Michelob ultra for 3.35/pop. To top it all off, the steelers lost. I am now 0-2 for playoff games at BWW. Still an okay spot to chill and watch the game."}
{"text":"went last Sunday with a couple of friends. the food was horrible and the service was just ok........ chicken was dry and tasteless... will not go back"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for wings every Tuesday. The special on Tuesdays are 75cents per wing. I think the size of the wings here are perfect. I don't like it when the wings are too big.  Usually, I go for the dry rub, like Cajun and chipotle BBQ. They have a speciality sauce once in awhile.  I hate chicken drums, so the best part of this restaurant is that they accommodate my needs and give me all flats. Tonight, the first round, we remember to ask for all flats, second round we forgot to request for flats. As we didn't want the wings to go to waste, of course we kept it. To our surprise, they came back and gave us a set of all flat wings. I thought that was very good customer service and thoughtful that they went out of their way to do it.  The service, they always make you feel welcome! That's why I am a frequent customer of Buffalo Wild Wings! Worth a try if you haven't ventured out to this restaurant for wings!"}
{"text":"For $10, i would have expected a non frozen burger,  didnt hit the spot, in town on business, wont be going there again"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time, yesterday. My son used to rave about this place when he lived here. What a mistake.   Our waitress, was self admittedly, only 1 week new at BWW, and it showed. She couldn't answer simple questions about menu items, such as, how many wings come in a order, what are specials on current menu, etc..  I ordered a Large order of boneless wings, half regular buffalo sauce, half garlic sauce. Also ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and a basket of fries.   The dip came 1st. It was very small for the price, but at least tasted good. The wings and fries arrived together. The fries were cold. We had to have them remade, but instead the waitress just went and grabbed another order that was sitting under the heat lamp. They were still semi cold.   The wings were the worst item, though. I had thought BWW was known for its \"fresh\" made wings. We received nothing close to fresh. The wings arrived, also, cold and very, very,  hard and simply not good.   I would advise anyone thinking of BWW to rethink to a different place. What a waste of time it was.   Ohh, and to top off the bad service and food, the waitress said the management was not available to speak at the time."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say (which is never a good thing).. Service was slow.. We came on a Friday night so we expect it to be busy, but for the wait staff to be able to hanled it. I was brought the wrong drink after  already waiting 20 minutes for it. Appetizer came out with food. Wings were lacking flavor all around. I don't know why we ever bother going to any of the Buffalo Wild Wings. Never a good experience. Skip this place and head over to Olive Garden next door where they at least pretend to make their food from scratch"}
{"text":"Tuesday wings night ordered 10 wings .. All were too dry and was charged 65 cents each vs 49 cents as informed. No good..."}
{"text":"60 cent wing Tuesdays, closest bdubs to the strip as well as my house, and an amazing setup for watching sports"}
{"text":"This is a chain that originated in Ohio but I am glad that it made it out west to Las Vegas. Although it can get pricey, since they don't have an actual happy hour, I do enjoy going in here to watch Kentucky basketball games with the other UK fans that frequent the bar. I usually take advantage of the Tuesday 45 cent wing nights. UFC fights are also fun to watch but you got to get there early to secure a spot because they have an awesome setup with many projector TVs and two separate zones for sound for watching and listening to sporting events."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the best super bowl parties i've been to. I had reserved a booth that sits six for the super bowl game earlier in the week Carlos the manager hooked me up, i had purchased the $100.00 gift card which also reserved the booth. Our server \"Sir Ron\" was on it! we were pleasantly greeted and seated. The wings were awesome as well as the desert and the big screen TV's were spread everywhere, a good view at all angles. The gift card paid for all the food and all the drinks, and their was a lot of it! it also helped to get 25% off the tab since my son works there (employee discount). oh yeah!  Anyhow, they also had raffles at the end of every quarter where you can win cool prizes. i won the grand prize at the end of game a 50\" flat screen TV! Wow, i still can't believe it! i think i'll come here more often. =)"}
{"text":"I can't even believe I'm reviewing a Buffalo Wild Wings. You are all witnessing what can only be described as a low point in my Yelping. Ugh, ok, let's just get this over with.  First of all, why did I even come here? Because it was Friday night and my family wanted to go out and my dad hates any place with live music, crowds, noise, and \"lots of energy.\" So Buffalo Wild Wings is the perfect place to go if you hate people and fun, basically. And my brother wanted to go here because they have trivia, which by the way is also not fun because if I am one thing I am fucking competitive and I hate losing and will go out of my way to try to ruin the fun for everyone else if I do. Also the game itself is full of either esoteric questions or totally obvious ones and if you wait long enough they give you the answer. Total bullshit.   Oh so the restaurant itself I'm pretty sure is segregated. The hostess insisted that we sit at the bar even though the front dining area had plenty of tables open because she said there were only two waitresses for that area and they were already busy. So we walked through there and pretty much everybody was black. The bar had some people in it and (you should expect this if you've been reading carefully) they were all white. Probably a total coincidence. I'm not really sure but I'd guess Yelp might frown upon such a nonchalant accusation of segregation.  The only other time I've been to a Buffalo Wild Wings was in high school when I went with my friend Katie and these twins, Greg and whatever the gay one's name was. All I remember from that was the twins were really hot and I had a thing for Greg and didn't find out until January when I visited Katie in Brooklyn that a) Greg is her roommate now and b) he totally had a thing for me, too. So when we reunited we hella made out and I know my ex-boyfriend doesn't read this but if he does I might as well come clean about also making out with 3 other guys early on in our relationship because that's what you get when you date me for 5 months and refuse to acknowledge me as your girlfriend, asshole! This entire paragraph has nothing to do with this restaurant but whatever if I want to use Yelp as my diary I DAMN WILL.   So anyway we ordered like 25 wings for the table and I'll just cut to the chase, they sucked. I asked the waitress if they had anything that they didn't deep fry and she replied, \"Everything is fried.\" So I ate all this fried greasy food and felt horrible and my old college/post-college/occasionally current bulimia habit kicked in because I just didn't want that shit in my body. That is how bad Buffalo Wild Wings is. Fuck now I wish I would not have told my mom about Yelp because she reads my reviews now I guess. She said some of them are funny. SOME OF THEM?? She also says I'm \"too sarcastic so that I can sound edgy\" and to that I say you may be right but Yelp reviews are the only things keeping me from pulling the trigger on the Beretta I put to my forehead every night before bed, so just let me do this the way I want. Man, that was really dark. Now THAT'S edgy!  Wow what the hell was I even talking about? Oh yeah, I didn't like the wings here."}
{"text":"Dirty, dirty, dirty!!! Just filthy! We left couldn't risk eating in a place so filthy.  I love the wings at buffalo wild wing but this particular location needs to either re-train their employees, hire new employees or close down permanently."}
{"text":"In my entire life, from managing a restaurant myself, to training staff and upper management, I have NEVER experienced SUCH horrific service. From the moment I stepped in, the woman in the front house (host) looked like she couldn't stand being there. Then the bartender was EXTREMELY rude. We go to sit at a table after being spoken to so rudely, we had just gotten off a flight for a work trip and this was the cherry on top of a horrible night. One of the people with us has a medical condition and they don't have anything to accommodate her diet on the menu so she had her own food while the rest of us ordered food. The manager then comes over to us and said that she cannot eat outside food in the restaurant. Which is completely understandable BUT when there is a medical condition we didn't have a choice. Which he should have been accommodating considering we have been customers for years specifically to this location and the rest of us had already ordered plenty. He then asked us to leave since she was eating and proceeded to call the police. Upon asking for his name he told us he will give us his business card and wouldn't give us his name. We waited then he changed his mind and told us to come back tomorrow AS HE CALLED THE POLICE. I have never experienced anything like this. I'm completely baffled. Absolutely disgusted. Not a single one of us will EVER return. This is a picture of the so called \"manager\"."}
{"text":"Been waiting for a waiter to come over to take our order for 35 minutes. Our host told us she doesn't know how our bills are going to turn out because of our difference of drinks for 7 people. Kind of crazy."}
{"text":"Recently brought my kids here for lunch on veterans day. I was offered a free large order of wings and fries since I am a veteran which was appreciated. The servers were all very friendly and interacted with my kids a lot which they liked."}
{"text":"On a busy Friday night, my girlfriend and I decided we needed some wings in our lives, and headed to Buffalo Wild Wings. Most of the tables were taken, so we decided to sit at the bar for a better view of the fights.  My girlfriend ordered two Top Shelf Long Islands for us. I'm always up for a solid Long Island, as long as its quality vodka, hence the request for top shelf liquor. The \"bartender\" began to put the drinks together with Smirnoff vodka. (Mind you, the only reason that we paid any attention is because my girlfriend is a bartender.) When the drinks arrived, because we saw that the drinks hadn't been blessed with top shelf liquor, we inquired why we were charged $7.15 per drink for Top Shelf Long Islands, when the drinks were not Top Shelf. The \"bartender\" responded with \"Well that's how we make our Top Shelf\" and proceeded to go get her manager to fight her battle. I make good money, I'm not beefing about the ticket, but when you say \"top shelf\" as in Patron, Tanqueray, Grey Goose, Bacardi ect., you are not expecting Smirnoff.  The manager came to the bar, did not introduce himself, and brought 2 separate receipts with him: one that had our order, and another that had a 36 dollar price with each shot of each Top Shelf ingredient to make the drink that we requested. The manager was extremely rude in explaining their blatant misrepresentation of a simple drink to essentially fool people into thinking that they are getting a higher quality drink than they are.  Whens the last time YOU had a 36 dollar Long Island?  Never.  We decided that even though Buffalo Wild Wings was stupid packed, after the untruths of our drinks, the cowardly retreat of our so-called \"bartender\", and the lack of managerial addressing of a simple situation, it was not for us on that night, and probably not ever again."}
{"text":"Fun sports vibe to it.  Great for a high calorie lunch.  If you're on a diet, do not come here.  You're guaranteed to gain 5 lbs."}
{"text":"I am very heated about my experience, unlike my food when it arrived cold to my table. We arrived at 7:30 and didn't leave until 9. The food took ridiculously long to come. (I understand that they were a bit busy but if our food arrived cold I don't understand why we had to wait so long). Our waitress had such a bad attitude, would not bring any refills to the table, and whenever she actually came to the table she would make zero conversation and would leave again within 10 seconds. We ordered a large boneless wings and four of the wings were missing. When we mentioned it she seemed annoyed that we even brought it up. While we were sitting there waiting for our check we look over and see our waitress kissing her boyfriend by the door. By the time we FINALLY got our check we tried to mention something to the manager to see if we could get something taken off of the bill for the poor customer service we had. He basically excused the waitresses actions and was standing up for her. He said they couldn't take anything off the bill and offered us a free snack size wing (only usable at that specific location, and we don't even live here). Very unsatisfied and probably won't return."}
{"text":"AWFUL! BDUBS has definitely lost it. They used to be our favorite spot but location after location, they just suck!!  For example, we came to this one Saturday night. It was NOT busy. Very light for a Saturday evening. It really just felt like a weekday night. We stood at the front counter for almost 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us and gave us a table. We sat outside because it was nice out and there were only two tables taken. We were seated, given menus and told a server would be right over. I kid you not, 15 minutes we sat there with no server!!! There was a waitress helping the other two tables but it was clear we weren't her responsibility b/c she wouldn't even look at us. Right when we were about to leave because we were tired of being ignored, a waiter came out and apologized for the wait and took our order. He was a nice guy but seemed to be having a bad night. We ordered mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and boneless wings for the dinner.  I think 20 minutes or so went buy and we finally got the mozzarella sticks. Some of them didn't even have cheese in them but you know what, we let it go. It's really not the biggest deal in the world (even tho they are a cheese stick and should have cheese). We pointed it out to the waiter at one point and he just laughed.... After we wait and wait, and let's not forget- we are sitting here watching the other waitress just cater to her tables non stop (we were pretty jealous), we finally got our food! Here it was!!! A medium order of boneless wings and a small order of boneless wings. I'm gonna say it was maybe a total of 30 wings+/-? The small order alone had about 13 wings. And the medium didn't have much more. Guess what you guys... one blue cheese!! That's right, ONE!!? There went more wasted time waiting around for blue cheese.  The food was sub-par. I always wish there was more chicken and less breading. They are too hard- maybe overcooked? Or maybe they are just frozen too long. Any ways, here's the best part!! We are eating our mediocre wings, watching the game on the tv, drinking water, finally starting to feel a 'little' satisfied when all of a sudden, an employee comes out on the patio to vent. And boy did he! Curse words were thrown out, he was tired of someone else not doing this or that, he's had it, F this, F that. The whole, \"it's not fair\" tantrum. He's just venting it all out to our waiter. It's funny really when you think about it: we wait for this server on everything all night long, but he has time to listen to a bus boy just wail out all his feelings. Right behind us. Highly unprofessional.  Meal is over, we've been there for about 1.5 hours. I am ready to go. Ridiculous amount of time to wait for a check. He comes out, asks if everything was good, my husband is like \"ehh- i mean I guess, can we get the check?\". At this point, we were over it all! Just let us out !!  I have my card out, he brings the check, I glance over the receipt real quick to make sure we weren't charge $1 per dressing or something crazy. He takes off with it, comes back, drops it on the table and says have a good night. I open up the booklet to sign and I found it strange that he took the receipt out? All that was left was the part for me to sign. I should've gotten my receipt.... why did he take it? But was I going to wait around to get a copy? Not likely, but it did seem shady. Maybe he didn't want me to do their survey??? lol (His name was Austin if it matters)  It's really sad to see this place suck. My husband and I had several dates here before we were married. Good memories. Guess they'll just have to stay memories because I am NEVER going back. Bye BDUBS- you were once loved :("}
{"text":"Service is one of the worst I  ever had.  Ther city at the entrance is rude and has no idea how to treat a customer. I will never be back again to this site."}
{"text":"I should have listened to the many reviews telling me this place was bad!!  I thought, its a chain, how bad can it be?  BAD!!!  Wings were soft, and had 3 times more sauce on the unspun wings as I've ever had.  Awful.  Will not return here again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  I would go again if a friend wanted to only because the location is perfect for before or after an ASU volleyball game.  The happy hour is decent.  $3 Vodka & Cranberry.  $3 garlic mushrooms.  I wouldn't pay more than that for either item.  I tried the $1.99 veggies with medium buffalo sauce and blue cheese.  Of course the veggie and blue cheese were fine but I didn't care for the medium flavored buffalo sauce.  I also had the soft pretzels with queso and garlic parm sauce.  The pretzels are small and hard and have no flavor.  The queso is icky and so is the garlic parm sauce.  I like that kid drinks are free but my kids didn't care for the wings, boneless wings or small burger.  They do like the dessert pizza but it is $7!!!  Plus they had no cheesecake bites the second time we had it.  The service once was fine and the second time was horrible and slow.  Also the TV's are so loud it hurts my ears."}
{"text":"I placed an online order that was to be ready at 6:10 I arrived at 6:03pm and paid for my order. While waiting I placed another order for fried mushrooms. It is now 6:52 and I was presented with the mushrooms but not my original order!! The server finally retrieved my food and what do you know, it's been sitting and is now cold. I asked to speak to the manager and his response was \"oh I bagged this a long time ago\" there are TWO workers doing the takeout window.. and they are blaming each other for my order not being ready... the manager says \"I wish they would do away with the online ordering because it's not accurate\" it's 2018!!!! How is your online ordering not accurate??? Not to mention it was clearly ready and just never brought up front. Ridiculous and I will never order here again.. going on 7pm and I'm waiting on  a FRESH order. Not to mention I've watched 2 other people leave and come back with messed up orders.. it's chicken and fries people.. oh and while waiting I got to witness a lovely screaming match between two servers in the back.. real professional"}
{"text":"absolutely horrible. i live very close and used to go here quite a bit but i finally had enough and will not be back. the service is completely terrible. we have literally waited over half an hour for service on multiple occasions.  i can't count the number of times i've sat way too long with an empty drink, both at tables and at the bar.  it doesn't matter if they're busy or not, the service is always horrendous. once we specifically asked to be seated in the one good server's section and they wouldn't accommodate us even though there was plenty of room. every person i know who has been here (which is a lot of people) have had the same experience. it's a shame because it's one of the only places around that isn't full of smoke and they show all the games, but i'll just be staying at home from now on.  absolutely do not recommend."}
{"text":"What a pathetic service. We ordered 45 mins before online and when we reached they said 10 more mins. We reached already 5 mins after the given time. The lady was so rude, that while talking to me, she ignored me and took the call to take orders, and I had to wait just for telling that we ordered online. And the wings were very bad compared to what we had earlier. Poor service and worst food. Will not suggest."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! My god I wouldn't go back to this place if they paid me to eat there! Seriously unfortunate because my daughter loves their food."}
{"text":"My wife and come at least once a week. We always sit at the bar \"no waiting\" Libby behind the bar is a workaholic. No matter what evening it is she is always there. We are so glad because the personal service is great. Leaves me with special memories of my wife and I to enjoy for years to come. Thanks Libby and Wild Wings"}
{"text":"The service has always been good. The food comes out hot. The best thing about summer when you can't do much during the week or outside due to the heat is to come here on Tuesdays where you get half priced wings and watch the DBacks on the big screens. They go well together at a great price."}
{"text":"The service and food are so bad here right now that I have to recommend staying away until they get their act together. I've never had a restaurant experience worse than the one I had here recently. The waitress was rude. Her service was terrible. The order was wrong. The food was over-cooked."}
{"text":"Was very hesitant to even go because of all the very bad reviews. But it was 2-1. I was out voted. We chose to sit in the bar area so we can sit right away. We were offered a table by people that were leaving and their cups and trash were still on the table. The waitress cleaned it right away. We got our drinks right away. We ordered appetizers and they came in a timely manner. Once our food was ordered it came about 15/20 minutes later. Reasonable. Nice and warm very delicious. The honey bbq wings very extremely scrumptious. I wish we ordered a bigger batch. I gave it 4 stars because there was a charge for beer on our ticket. We drank ice tea and lemonade! She removed it but had I not checked I would have never noticed. I don't normally check for those things. But we still gave a great tip because she was very attentive and extremely busy. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wings, beer, sports. If you are a fan of any of these, you'll enjoy \"B-Dubs\", their nickname. They have 16 signature sauces and 5 dry seasonings to choose from. Bone-in or out. An all you can eat boneless deal for $12.99! Servers were friendly and par for service. Their other menu items are good as well. I had the Southwest Chicken Queso Wrap. It was a good portion and satisfying. The fries that accompanied the wrap were very good too. The manager came around to ensure we were enjoying ourselves which should be done everywhere if you ask me. If I had my own restaurant, I would totally do this. As you may assume, this is a chain restaurant. I've been to a few different locations in and around Charlotte. All are a fun, lively atmosphere. Great after a hard days work."}
{"text":"I ordered pick up and originally the girl on the phone was so rude but when I was greeted by Jojo she made the whole visit AWESOME great customer service!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start.... the service here is horrible! Manager, John Walker, is more worried about counting money than to help customers who have been waiting for a while. The stupid girl at the take out counter doesn't even greet customers, just yells \"WHAT'S THE NAME?\". When ordering take out, I highly recommend double checking everything ordered before leaving the business, they ALWAYS mess up! In this market, where competition is so high, customer service should be priority! The food is not so great to make people come back constantly but if the service is good, they just might."}
{"text":"I prefer this location over any other; the service is great, the food arrived quickly, and they don't skimp you on the wing sauce!"}
{"text":"This IS THE BEST  BUffalo Wild wings in Phoenix hands down!!! You can say what ever you want about other locations but go see Ray at THIS location he rocks!!! No BS. Just quick customer service and gives REAL recommendations!!! Remember it RAY! Petron was Ice cold and ready for my date! Made her feel taken care of! Ray gets 10 stars out of 5. Believe it!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. After not having dined at a Buffalo Wild Wings in YEARS, my husband did not want to stop at Wing Stop on the way home, and since BWW is just around the corner from my home, he urged me to try it again. Never ever again.  It was Thursday and they have a wonderful deal of $.60 boneless wings, except that they ended up coming out as fried little pieces of sub-par \"chicken\". We got 5 sauces: mango habanero, spicy BBQ, Thai curry, lemon pepper,and garlic parm. They were all terrible. The garlic parm was HORRIBLE! They squirt slimey, sticky \"sauce\" all over these wings, without a hint of real cheese or garlic and call it good. Lemon pepper was the best, although probably because they were plain fried \"chicken\" and weren't coated in one of their disgusting sauces. Thai curry shouldn't even be a flavor of chicken wings because they were disturbing. Spicy BBQ was nothing original, and on the same level as lemon pepper. Mango habanero were so spicy that we could only eat one each because we didn't want to be in agonizing pain.  We also ordered a side of fries, which were cut skinny and fried crispy. I liked the fries, and tried the salt and vinegar seasoning. The seasoning was tasty for the first couple of bites, but got old very quickly. Overall, we tossed most of the wings because we only tried about 1 of each, when we ordered 30 wings total followed by extreme bloating the following day. We will definitely stick to their competitor."}
{"text":"I'm usually a Wingstop fan but when I had a wing craving on a budget, I suggested Buffalo Wild Wings to my husband because their wings are $0.45 on Tuesdays. I haven't eaten here in 4 years because the last couple of times were gross, but I decided to give it another try and after tonight, never again Buffalo Wild Wings.   We ordered 15 spicy garlic and 15 Asian zing traditional bone-in wings, large fries, veggie sticks, and 3 ranches. The quality of the wings seemed lesser than those of Wingstop; they were small, tough, and over cooked. The spicy garlic sauce was a typical hot sauce with a bit of garlic flavor and the Asian zing was sweet and boring topped with red chili flakes. Although neither of which were actually spicy like their names implied, I definitely prefer the \"spicy\" garlic.   The large fries looked like a medium from McDonald's. When we order a large fry from Wingstop, I've had 4 adults and two children work on it but never managed to finish it whereas my husband and I alone were able to kill these fries. The veggies had really stringy, strangely bright green celery, and baby carrots. The tiny ranches, which cost 60 cents each, tasted like they came from a bottle of Hidden Valley.   When I pulled up to pick up my food at 8:30 PM, the place was packed with people parking in the adjacent desert. The girls in the front tilted my box of Asian zing on the side so all of the sauce spilled over the boxes and the bag. Since I haven't eaten here in so long, I thought that the box was holding something which should be stood vertically, but if I worked here and saw to-go bags going out constantly, I would have noticed it and fixed it. So I guess some people like to come here for the scene and the game, but if you're looking for a good wing meal to-go, this is definitely not the place to get it from."}
{"text":"Parking is horrendous at this location, and because so, overpowers any positive news in the restaurant.  The U haul neighbors dominate the parking area with ominous threatening signs. The restaurant was ok. Standard fair. It was a busy night & tables were crammed next to each other. Bumping elbows & chairs does not condone a pleasant experience.  Food was ok. Have gotten slightly better at other locations.  Server was new, but pleasant and handled tables reasonably well. About equal distance from another location.  Will go there next time."}
{"text":"Good chicken, great flavors...it's what's to be expected at BWW. This location is good for a nice family getaway. Not as busy as other locations which is a plus and the staff is very helpful. Caribbean Jerk is a must, and the new flavor (Desert Heat) is a nice addition also. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Had a good time the other night at buffalo! Ashley I. was our server and she was great. She brought out our drinks and food in a timely manner and was very attentive to us. It is hard to find a good server now a days that can keep a conversation with the guests and make sure that they have a good time."}
{"text":"Beer has been empty since forever. Manager walks by almost wanting high fives for his parlay his just hit. My beer is still empty... great 5 star service ?"}
{"text":"My son wanted wings after visiting the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Fortunately for us, BWW is connected to the HOF. There's even an access from inside the HOF. We parked in the garage next door for $18/day. We walked in around 4pm. The place was not busy at all, just a few customers dining.   Before I get to the food, I would like to give credit to our server, Hollie. She was very professional, attentive, and helpful from start to finish. I would give her 5 stars easily! She provided excellent service.   Now, for the food. We ordered: Crispy chicken tenders (4-piece) with cheese curds on the side $8.99 Kids medium wings with a side of fries $4.69 Ginger ale $2.89 Sweet tea $2.89  I was pleasantly surprised with my chicken tenders. The meat was juicy. The cheese curds were tiny cheese cubes dipped in batter and fried. I enjoyed that as well. The tea was plenty sweet. My son loves hot wings and was very pleased with his entree. His kids entree came with 4 wings, which was enough for him as well as a side of fries. The fries were just okay.  For a restaurant with only a 2-star rating, I walked in with very low expectations. However, I walked out with better. Although the food isn't mind blowing, we had a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Ate here several times but came in tonight and had one of the worst experiences I've ever had, we sat for 45 minutes waiting on our food in a slightly empty restaurant while people who came in after us already got and ate their food. We had empty beers and was looking for a waitress to ask for more but she was in the back texting the entire time. Ended up having to ask a manager and still waited another 20-25 minutes for our food and still our waitress Taylor never came to ask if we where okay or apologize for the wait. She never checked on our food she stood at the wait station by the bar and texted the entire time even after being told we were looking for it. Food time is the kitchens fault but it  was clear she forgot to put our food in for a while, and she should probably be more worried about her tables and not her phone. Didn't really seem like the manager on duty was to worried about it either. Finally get our food and 2 of ours was ridiculously cold and soggy had to send it back and wait again, ended up just taking off some of our food off our bill and not eating. She ended up getting a discount for us for only 15% off of it all. Thanks for the 1.40 off Taylor."}
{"text":"Almost didn't go because of the reviews about the service, but went anyway because it was close and was in the mood for wings. Food was very good (wings were cooked just right, extra crispy). The best part was the service, our waiter was on time with everything and best of all we had to sit outside (52 degrees) because it was a playoff game and showed up in the fourth quarter and we did not bring a coat for our five year old daughter, so the hostess went into the back and let her wear a BWW sweatshirt. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a couple weeks, but being today is Sunday and I'm not there I felt compelled to write why this Bdubs on Durango has been our fantasy football league's spot for most of the 2015 season.   Of course we all enjoy beer, wings, and sports but the real reason we come here is Chantel our server in the bar area. She has been outstanding all season - remembering our favorites (Desert Heat Wings with Blue Cheese & Diet Pepsi for me ), making sure our table was doing great, but also putting up with our howling and screaming when our football teams were getting their butts kicked, or kicking some butts!   We've had some exciting  moments here this season and look forward to coming back in the seasons to come. My leaguemates and I all agree: we're grateful for the terrific staff at the Durango location for their amazing service and most of all, treating us like Champs."}
{"text":"Great service, good food and lots of TV's for sports fans. Our server, Chris, was very funny and made great recommendations! Pretty good beer selection  and mixed drinks as well."}
{"text":"So it's not often I write a review but I thought this was some really bad service and needed to be known. My brother and I went to buffalo wild wings and we asked how long it would be as we had to run somewhere else in a bit of a hurry.   The waitress said about 15 minutes which seemed about normal for two small things of wings (just a snack before we had a meeting). We ended up not getting our wings for about 50 minutes and never heard from our waitress.   I saw someone nearby who had ordered a large portion of wings who got there after us and they received their wings before us. Now there could very well of been a reason for this but the server should have said there was a problem and we would have just left rather than wait for the food.  It was also not busy at all about 2:00 PM on a Wednesday."}
{"text":"Although the atmosphere is good like all BWW the food at this particular one is utterly disgusting. The wings are fatty and oil pours out of them when you bite into them. And you have to love the slimy feel of the skin on your lips. YUM!!!  If I was only going for a beer then maybe I would come back but for food there are many fast food restaurants in the area that I would suggest picking from first."}
{"text":"Stopped to grab a quick bite and watch a baseball game back in August. Terrible experience. Out of three of the draft beers listed on the menu, on a slow mid-week day too! So the waitress suggested a \"special\" draft. Also out. My husband finally got one after several more tries. I ordered a coffee, and after a shocked look from the server it finally arrived in a paper cup with a pint of milk on the side. No creamer or 1/2 and 1/2."}
{"text":"I wont go to this location anymore. It's seriously the worst service ever. I'm not basing this off one experience either, I've given it multiple trys and it's been bad each time. Once, it took the server almost 5 mins after we seated to come get out drink order and then almost 40 for our food to arrive. The food is standard for a BWW but their service is terrible!"}
{"text":"I love BDubs my food unfortunately here was cold and when I asked about the points for my rewards the bartender woman said sorry I already rang you up and you need to tell me sooner so can't do anything for you. First bartender Chris was awesome but the girl who took over after him on 3/7/17 around d 3 or 4 in the afternoon..... thumbs down. I hope Chris got the tip I left also. I had spent around $40 which I guess I'm not getting points for, she offered no alternative either just walked away and handed me my bill. Don't think I'm coming back to this particular location, damn shame."}
{"text":"The food was good like every buffalo wild wings place! The service was subpar. It took forever to get a drink or a refill. Was in a group of people and the food came out at all different time some people were finishing up while some just got their food. The bathroom was disgusting and nasty. Would not go back to this location. Also had homeless right outside the door begging for money or your left overs. Which I gave them my left overs. Just something you don't want to walk into right after eating."}
{"text":"My \"15 minutes or free\" order took 45 minutes. Never saw my waitress during that time. Bartender plopped my food on the table and kept on walking. I'm guessing it was sitting at the bar because it was cold. Waitress finally came by set a Coke on the table, and kept walking. I wasn't drinking Coke, I was drinking unsweetened tea. If she stopped and actually spoke to me, she might have noticed the lemon and Splenda that was next to my glass. Then brought me the bill. I reminded her this was way past their guarantee. She said she would get the manager. Manager never came. After 20 minutes she took the bill and said don't worry about it."}
{"text":"Same ol Buffalo Wild Wings as anywhere else, so nothing too amazing.  The place is clean, floors are clean and staff are friendly. Food came out quickly and our server was very attentive. This place reminds me of kind of like an upscale bar food place as they sell pretzels, nachos, and lots of finger foods.   There are TV's all over the place, 2 claw machines and another game machine. All in all, I'm sure I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"The last couple of times I was here I had no issues - until tonight.  No one acknowledged us for 10 minutes until we flagged a waitress down.  She took our drink order and came back and was surprised that the other waitress had not brought us drinks nor even come by the table.  Finally our drinks arrived, minus the water my wife requested.  We then ordered food.   I ordered 12 boneless wings and was brought regular wings.  My salad was delivered without silverware so I had to snag some from another table.  My wife's fish tacos were supposed to come with tortilla chips and salsa, they came with fries instead.  I will say the manager corrected everything, but it sucked since we were on our way to a show and almost late because of how disorganized this place was.  It will be a while before I go back.  The wings suck anyway and most of the food is frozen then fried crap."}
{"text":"The hubs and I planned on meeting a friend to watch a hockey game on a Sunday evening. The bar was rather full... Just a few empty tables. The bar top was empty so we attempted to take a seat... The female bartender come up so fast and demanded my ID before I could even sit down! I realize i look young, but god damn! So just to be an ass I ordered a water. Seriously give me a minute.   Now, that entire experience had set the tone... We had to ask to order any thing... She would not check on us... Then she argued about a mistake she made! Her shirt was so worn her name was no longer visible  and the entire time we sat at her bar we didn't know her name. Since I was starving I order the poppers and a side salad. They brought the veggie platter, she rang in an $8 salad. When I clarified what i wanted she blamed the mistake on the kitchen (I could see on the screen what she had rang in). When my husband tried to justify the confusion, there is no $8 garden salad on the menu, she argued and was defensive. From that point we could hear her complaining about us to other employees! Classy. We again had to ask the manager for the side garden salad... He was told we didn't want it. WTF!!!!!! We eventually got the apology owed from the manager... Not our bartender. He did his best to rectify the situation, which is why we stayed.   She left with an attitude. John took over! He had one of those new shirts and a name tag! He did great! 5stars for john. When I ordered; he repeated and clarified my order. Everything met expectation, in the end. BWW isn't my favorite place to dine, but we were in a pinch... John was truly the saving grace tonight. Very knowledgable on menu items, cracking jokes and working hard. We gladly showed our appreciation in our tip tonight. He would be the only reason why we would return.   The poor rating on this review is directly connected to my experience with what's her name...."}
{"text":"Check your order before you leave. They are not very good with communication skills. If I did not look at my receipt I would have been screwed. Poor service skills."}
{"text":"I like Buffalo Wild Wings. I've never really had a problem at one before. But this was a pretty terrible experience. I was able to get a table no problem, and the server came out pretty quickly. But it went downhill from there. Once I ordered, it took a really long time to get my food. Then, when it did come out, half of my order was wrong. So I had to wait again to get the rest of my order. My food was delivered to my table in three separate trips. No apology for the wait, no discount. So I finally finish my food, get a to-go box for the half of my order that was received last so I'd already eaten the rest of it, and pay. Then when my transaction hits my bank, I realized they'd overcharged me. There were two transactions for BWW on my bank account instead of one. Just a bad experience all around. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been here probably 20 times and I finally decided to write a review.  First off, I am a guy.  That being said, I would prefer to have a woman as my waitress at a sports bar, but there are more male waiters at this establishment.  Don't get me wrong the guy waiters are actually more attentive and better at their job than the female waitresses, but there is just something about going to a sports bar that makes me want to have a female waitress (or is it just me).  I have had some good/bad waiters and waitresses on my trips here.  I would like to acknowledge Kirsten C., who did an excellent job the last time that we came in. The food, well its bar food and you probably cant expect much more than what it is.  The beer is a little pricey, but I do like the fact that they bring in some microbrews that arent found at other bars (i.e. Kona Pipeline Porter).  There are plenty of TV's and they go to lengths to make sure the game that you want to watch is on a screen.  Especially since we went there to watch the NHL playoffs and that sport isnt exactly popular in the south. Overall, the main reason that I go back to this place is the NTN trivia and the fact that I can watch whatever game that I want.  The place is never that crowded after 8pm and it is a nice place to have a few beers and relax."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Quaker steak wings are better. To each their own. Never been impressed with the wings. Watching a game with the guys is good time with some drinks but the food quality is always subpar at best."}
{"text":"I went to BWW to meet up with co-workers this past week for dinner and a few drinks.  As soon as we walked in and ordered our first drink we noticed it was uncomfortably warm in the entire restaurant. We asked our server and she responded with \"it's been like this for about four years, our A/C just doesn't work well but they said soon we might get some fans\" as if she has to say this to every person who sits down.  I am someone who is always pretty cold and defiantly wasn't the most uncomfortable person at the table. We decided not to stay for dinner and go to another restaurant because it was so unbearable. Our server was sweet and very attentive ( that's why I didn't write a one star review)  Word of advice- if you want to keep your customers and incredibly patient staff, GET A/C!!!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I love this place, but lately it seems like the bartenders don't care anymore. I don't know if it's because of management or they really don't care about their customers. It's not just one bartender either, it's all of them. I always order take out and like to have a beer while I'm waiting for my food. It always takes 5 to 10 minutes for them to even acknowledge that I'm there. It seems like they are always trying to leave before I finish my order. It's sad because I always tip well even if it's not deserved. It's not going to stop me from going because I love the food. They have the best wings I've ever had, no matter what time I go the wings are always good. I'm a chef and I love to cook, but I still can't stay away. On a side note, the parking is horrible. I don't know who the Hell U-Haul thinks they are, but they have taken over the parking lot. I used to park in the desert in the back, but now they have put their trailers in the way of that too. I've been going there since it opened and will continue to do so. I just hope the bartenders wake up"}
{"text":"Service and food was considerably good, considering they were very busy. Loved this location being open 24/7. We hit a Tuesday - wing night - had a great time."}
{"text":"Greeted upon entry. To go orders are always open. Quick and fresh from the kitchen. They always review your order before you leave."}
{"text":"Run of the mill bdubs. Biggest screens are projectors so not as good as picture as HDTV or 4K. Also the tvs around the place all have different picture settings. Could be the same sporting event but 1 tv can be 10 times better than any other one, it may just not be observable from where are sitting.   I have been to others and absolutely loved them just not this one so much."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ever. If I could give 0 stars I would. I have worked in the restaurant industry for a long time and would normally give the benefit of the doubt but in this situation I just cannot. When we walked in the door every single bar table was unoccupied, unbussed and dirty - I mean filthy. We sat at a dirty table and waited for our server to get it clean for us. We lost our appetite just by sitting near the filthy tables surrounding us. How do they not have bus boys or take pride in their restaurant!? Well we still decided to stay and we ordered the wings and they came out dry and looked as bad as they tasted - disgusting. The tablets we received to play trivia on looked like they have never been cleaned. We will never be back and recommend you stay away as well."}
{"text":"This is the worst take-out service ever!!!!! It's happened to me on several occasions that'll I'll call and then they put me on hold for over 10 minutes!!!!! Then I get so upset that I hang up and call back and they try to put me on hold again! I've walked in, still on hold with them because at this point I've already arrived and the people In front will just be chatting away! This is absolutely unacceptable, and the managers are not apologetic or anything. Their take-out service is the absolute worst!!!!"}
{"text":"Came for a football Sunday with my son to watch some of the games and get some Chicken strips.  The wait for a table was crazy, though I do not blame them for being busy.  The hostess staff was in control of the situation, but once the early games were over and the tables cleared it took another 15-20 minutes to get everyone seated.  Small issues that I would normally overlook.  The real problem is in the food.  The grilled chicken strips were practically inedible.  They are coated with something that makes them tough and stringy.  And the sauces were honestly kind of gross. I used to go to B-Dubs in college and have much fonder memories of the quality of the food, but I guess I was drinking a lot more beer back then and didn't focus as much on the flavor and texture of the food.  There have to be better places to get a drink and watch every football game at once than this."}
{"text":"I used to frequent BW3 a lot more when I live in Virginia then I do now. The menu has changed, one of my favorite appetizers is no longer offered. The food (chicken) is still the same even though the prices have remained steady when it comes to traditional wings but less are offered. Boneless wings are  about $2 more for the same serving size a ls traditional. I miss dining here but don't feel the same. On my recent visit all I ordered was wings and an angry orchard. Can't complain about the food but I honestly enjoyed wild wing cafes lemon pepper wings better."}
{"text":"Couldn't agree more with the 1 star reviews - what irked me - being seated at 6:55pm - anxiously looking around for waitstaff (mind you, they weren't busy) so I could order my cold draft beer before 7pm so I can get the happy hour price - only to be greeted (and I'm using that term loosely) at 7:02pm by the waitress and being told \"I'm sorry, the computers have already switched - I can't honor that price\" - wth?  That's what we like to call \"can don't\" attitude.  What happened to good old fashioned customer service?  The entire visit went COMPLETELY downhill from there.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings is in the same building as NASCAR Hall of Fame. The staff & management is so nice & made us feel so welcome here. The food was delicious & the drinks were outstanding. If we ever have any issue about the taste of the sauces of differences in menu items or prices they talked to use respectfully & answered all of our questions completely. The sweet tea is amazing & the hospitality is Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"I'm here visiting from out of town and must say this is the worst dining experience at a Buffalo Wild Wings in my entire life. My server was extremely nice but lacked the professionalism you would expect as a consumer from a server. I had to ask to have the table cleared and I  couldn't tell you her name because she never told us. She was never around and I had to go find her every time I wanted something. I really felt bad that I interrupted her cause she really seemed like she was into watching the game.   The worst thing is she had the audacity to ask me if I wanted my check now so that we could leave as soon as the game was over... it's was the third quarter with 4 minutes left.   Thanks Brandi!"}
{"text":"Great wings here. Finally a place that can make a spicy buffalo wings. Our waitress Brittany was amazing and very attentive, happy and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago, and I've eaten at a lot of restaurants from this particular chain in Illinois and Indiana. I stopped at this restaurant while In the area for a wedding and I have to say that this is the best I've seen. While not as large and visually impressive as some of the branches I've been to, they more than make up for it in every other way you can consider. I was immediately greeted and seated by a helpful smiling face. My order was taken, and served in a VERY timely fashion. I was checked on constantly by my server, and once by the manager who seemed genuinely concerned about my service. The food was normal Buffalo Wild Wings food and cooked properly (not saying that as a bad thing, you should know what you're getting when you walk into the place). Next time I'm back in the area and looking for some satisfying bar grub, I'll be sure to pay them a visit again!"}
{"text":"I love the menu changes and promotions. Get the Southeast Asian pork sandwich. It is very messy, so if you're on a date for the first time and don't look cute cramming a giant torpedo into your mouth and subsequently getting a mess on your face because of it, don't order it. However, if you do look cute at all times, go for it."}
{"text":"I love BWW so much. I always get garlic mushrooms off the shareable section and all flat, extra wet, traditional parm garlic wings. The wings seemed a little colder than they should've been if they were fresh. It was warm but not hot. It also took about 6 minutes when wings take 12 to cook. The waitress charged me for a drink (it's about $3 for a soda) when 3/4 was filled. You weren't busy at all. I was one of two tables for her. You can spare the three seconds it takes to let this fizz go down to put more in it. I don't mind paying for it, but give me what I paid for."}
{"text":"BWW is alright.  the only item that we used to go back to BWW is their Wings+Thai hot sauce.  Love the taste of the Thai hot sauce, they do sell it in bottles so one could make their own wings if health conscious.  Their wings is deep fried, obviously.  Sandwiches are okay, just the regular taste and so are the nachos.  We found ordering over phone and picking it up was quicker than placing the order after you sit in the restaurant."}
{"text":"First of all, they didn't have any of the beers I ordered even though it was on the menu.  The wings were okay.  If you like spicy, the \"hot\" will not do it.  The wings were cooked well but were on the small side.   If you go to watch sports, it's a good spot.  Lots of tv's and they have a variety of sports on."}
{"text":"People are great. Stacie.  Beer was cold.  Food was horrible.   Boneless wings=meatless pieces of fried batter. They need to teach their staff how many times you can microwave something."}
{"text":"Wings are delicious and happy hour prices are great for food and drinks. Our favorite place to go."}
{"text":"This location is a bit smaller than the rest, but it is just as good.  The staff is very friendly and of course lots of tv's to watch all the games."}
{"text":"I've been to lots of different B-Dubs locations and these guys are pretty good by comparison. The wings of course are the star. We get a mix of honey BBQ, hot buffalo and mango habanero to get a good range of flavors and heat. It's never going to be fine dining but it's a great place to watch sports and hang out."}
{"text":"You first walk in and it covers the \"chain\" BWW atmosphere... TV's and Wings! Now you meet the hostess (nice, but could have used a more sincere greetings - the place was empty on a Saturday Night 8-9pm). She shows up to our table and then becomes this espionage spy who is over looking her shoulder while trying to explain to us a \"anonymous survey\" which can turn into $3 off our total for the night (it covered all the usual waitor/waitress formality). Once we laughed that off we were then greeted by our waitress Jasmin whom took our drinks. The tables were disgustingly sticky, good thing we had Baby Wipes (perk of rolling with a baby)...  Now the menu - You come here for the wings which ranges from mild to HOT! and my wife is all about the mild and i'm in the middle ranges... So we went with Mild/Teriyaki/Medium... Only to return the Teriyaki. IT WAS HORRIBLE!!! Its like they just open up a bottle of really bad Teriyaki sauce and daused the wings in them... NO BUENO! Got our waitress to return the Teriyaki wings and brought out Honey BBQ... Which was a MAJOR improvement over the Teriyaki.  We go through our meal enjoying some NBA playoff action (again, it was empty??? NASCAR All-Star Race, NBA Playoff, and MLB action...) and paid off our total while we discreatly gave our \"anonymous survey\" back filled with all the truth!  Run of the mill Wing shack here... Will be going back for a UFC fight and see if they can mustard up a decent gathering..."}
{"text":"I always had great experience here. The service is alway great, staffs are very friendly and fun. Great place to watch UFC and sports. The wings are the best. My favorite is buffalo dried seasoning. You should try cheese curds. It is the best. This is My family's most favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this BWs is so bad but I hate going to this one.  It is often dirty, the floors are always slick, and there is always too much sauce on the over cooked wings.  The only redeeming quality is that the waitresses are nice. Please fix this location and make the world a better place again."}
{"text":"Well I don't want to give a bad review since I worked here and the boss isn't so great. I know a lot of the servers there and some are good some still need work. But I know these girls try hard. Well food is good I love there spicy garlic or medium or lemon pepper or salt an vinager wings or even Caribbean jerk is good. Their wraps are good as well and juice steak burger awesome! I didn't like the fish tacos though not good at all. Now I've def had a couple times were the food was not so great but remember its not the server most times its the cooks fault. They are good at having food runners and to run the food asap. So the majority of the time when it takes forever for your food its because of the cooks. Either they are new or someone is training someone or they have a catered event going on or sometimes in all honesty just plain screwing around in the back. Def on sun expect a wait due to its football sunday and its freaking packed in there."}
{"text":"I have visited this location many times however my most recent experience was horrible. It started with their signs on the door stating TAKE OUT ONLY ENTER THROUGH PATIO. The wording was a little off and confusing. We read it as take out orders are to enter through the patio. We walked in to the restaurant to discover it was all closed off. At first we thought they were closed and only accepting take out orders. Then we saw people standing by the patio so we walked back there. We stood in front of the host podium where there were 3 employees and a security guard who were all carrying on a conversation about one of the girls who was pregnant. Never were we greeted. We had to wait until their conversation was over. Then we asked if they were open (since the wording on the signs was vague). Instead of saying yes she immediately asked how many people we needed a table for in a rude snappy manner. Clearly there were only 2 of us there with a little baby. So she had someone bring us inside and the guy brought us a high chair as we requested. Well then we were told we would need to put the high chair on the inside of the table and not in the aisle. Understandable but the place our table was located when the table behind us was sat the man behind my son was backed up to the high chair causing barely any room. If the position of the high chair was such an issue why didn't they put us at a normal table. Our server was very sweet and nice. Seemed she was fairly new at serving but she was always smiley and kind.  I have always ordered the Cajun Quesadilla and enjoyed it however this time the chicken was very sparse in the tortilla and there was a weird taste to the meal over all.   I would recommend BWW to anyone however I feel the tactics of this particular visit were sub par and need to be reviewed. Also, do not try and visit this restaurant when there is a big fight on PPV or a big sporting event because you will not be allowed in unless you are there for that event."}
{"text":"My family and I frequented this same location of BWW prior to the shut down... When this new location opened, I was REALLY looking forward to going. We waiting a few months to let them work out any bugs, as most 'NEW' business have regardless of franchise or not. My husband and I decided to finally come in mid week for lunch to check it out, and get a feel of the new place.    I LOVED how much more open it felt, and as we walked in we still had that great \"hello\" and \"welcome\" that we were accustomed to. We decided to sit at the bar and we chose a booth right in the middle of the bar, being very visual. The waitress came over and asked if we had be there before, to which we stated \"not since it reopened\". She asked to start us with a drink. We both go two tall Bud lights. She also at the same time asked if we wanted to order any food, we said we needed a few more mins and we would be ready! So off she went! SO FAR SO GOOD, I was impressed!!   After about 5 min a runner brought over our beer, just sat it down and ran, I tried to ge her attention to get our waitress as we were now ready to order lunch.... fast forward 45 min later and MULTIPLE  attempts to get ANYONE to help.. We have been out of drinks (empty glasses at edge of table STACKED! FOR DRAMA) AND NOTHING!!! Bar only had three table full and two people at the actual bar so there was NO REASON we should not have had help! My husband and I actually walked to the front to the hostess and asked for our bill... we should have just walked out!!  We actually were ignorant to try this location again a week ago! SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED!! Except we didn't have to get up and ask for our waitress.. we caught someone flying by and they got our waitress. When the waitress came back over 45 min after we got there, she said are you ready to order? I was being nice and said \"I was hungry, now I just want the check because I'm not feeling wings anymore\" To which the waitress said to me 'RUDE, BE THAT WAY!!!!!\"  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!!  You couldn't give away your food and beer for me to put up with that environment!!!!!!! You need to get a new GM!! There is no one driving the staff to have some sense of urgency AT ALL!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! I got the boneless wings and I ended up getting the snack size (love that they offer less than 10). The snack size says at least 7 and I ended up getting 8. It was exactly perfect. I went with my mom and she got a burger and loved it. We split her fries (which were small, crisp, and hot). Probably the best food I've had at a restaurant lately. My only complaint is they were extremely slow, but I guess I shouldn't expect more from a bar on a college campus at 8pm on a Friday night.. We didn't see our hostess a ton, but it's understandable. Also, be ready to walk a bit. Parking is absolutely packed in the area.  Also, there's a pretty good ambience for a sports bar. There's huge flat screens by the bar as well as smaller ones spread throughput. Each has a different game of varying sports. However, it is slightly loud due to that. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the service!! Mike is the man!!  My husband and I go there and he always makes sure that we are taken care of. Tonight was one of those night where there was a drunk guy yelling across the bar and snapping his fingers at Mike. Everyone knew that he was the only bartender in the place so you had to wait your turn. Dude got mad that Mike cut him off and the guy first left without paying his bill.. A few minutes later he came back and paid it.  Big ups to Mike for not losing is cool and letting the situation get out of hand!!  We will forever come back just because of Mike and his Awesomeness!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE WINGS. I love love love wings. But I didn't love Buffalo Wild Wings.   I've read the previous reviews about service experienced at BWW and want to clarify that I didn't dine in, I simply called in my to go order.   I don't know how something as simple as calling in a to-go order could be so screwed up. I literally called - just ordering two small orders of wings, they said \"Great, it'll be ready in 10 minutes!\" Well great! I show up 10 minutes later and it's not busy, it was like a Tuesday afternoon. There were waitresses chilling out and talking - it was relaxed. So why did I have to wait an extra 20 minutes for my wings? It had been 30 minutes from my original phone call by the time I got them.   Following that - the wings sucked! So, so, so greasy - yuck!  However I must list the positives: (which is why I gave my review an additional star) I was greeted with a smile when I came in.  A nice looking manager asked me if I was okay after watching me wait for 15 minutes in the lobby. The cashier apologized for the wait.  So I was treated nicely, but I'm not going to ignore the fact I waited 30 minutes for 2 small wings that were disgusting."}
{"text":"Waitress didn't visit our table much corn was not cooked the the wings are great. Brunette waitress is all I remember"}
{"text":"It's Bdubs - what more can you expect? This location is fairly large, but despite the obvious availability of tables I'm usually waiting for an employee to amble over and get us seated. Luckily, there's a parking lot out back so you're not worried about your meter running out.  The cool thing about this Buffalo though, is that it's home to the Sporcle trivia nights on Wednesday evenings. No charge at all to play, just go to the Game Master (sitting with his mic and laptop next to the bar), pick up the answer forms, pick a team name, and play. The game play is a little different from traditional trivia nights I've been to, but it makes it more interesting wagering points on your answers based on how confident you are.   Since you're inevitably going to be waiting, you can ask your waiters for the handheld trivia game device which lets you play against other people nearby. A good way to pass the time and learn random facts. Or train for Trivia Crack I suppose. The other obvious choice is to open your mind to the hyper-stimulation provided by virtually every sports channel you could desire (in the US at least) arranged in collage-like fashion on the walls. Come to think of it, I don't even really know what color their walls are because my eyes never make it past the monitors and I've only gone at night.  Tuesday (or Thursday?) nights are $0.50 wing nights, which is a good deal if you're a fan of their wings. Unfortunately, I've always felt like I was taking a gamble whenever I get their wings since some of the flavors that sound appealing are either way too saucy or just plain yucky, and others (that I wouldn't order myself but sample from friends) turn out to be decent. I'm actually more of a fan of their appetizers, which turn out to be surprisingly filling as well.   The bathrooms are similarly hit or miss. Sometimes there's only one toilet that has been spared a messy fate and there's no more soap, and other times I emerge feeling refreshed and  clean."}
{"text":"My grandson and I stopped on before our 500 mile drive home. We were seated right away, and got our drinks and appetizer within 5 minutes. Our food arrived as we finished our appetizer. His wings and my BBQ chicken sandwich we're both great. The one surprising thing was the TV's and the music we're both at a comfortable volume. I wish our BWW in Alamogordo were like that. You can't hear yourself think."}
{"text":"Let me say the food here is always great! Buffalo Wild Wings food is by far the best bar food in the world. My rating is based off of the service here because the FOOD is ALWAYS perfect!   The service here is bipolar! Sometimes the service is great but sometimes it is awful.  I would like to shoutout JD! He is the best server at BWW. He is more attentive and patient and understands people. I have had him as a server at least 5 times and each time he is a professional and GREAT! Even with a party of 15 teenagers he was great! JD is the best server and he deserves to make more money and better tips than BWW allows.   For the rest of the staff, they are subpar. They rarely fill up water and don't care about the customers.   Buffalo Wild Wings is my favorite restaurant! I love their food! I just wish their staff was as great as JD!"}
{"text":"The stars are for the staff, the food gets zero stars from me.  Ordered the Black and Blue burger.  The bun was so hard it was hard to chew and the meat was dry and over cooked."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this 2 stars is because the food is good. However the service is really bad. We have been here a few times and I never wrote a review but last night prompted me to write this.  We got there around 7:15pm and we placed our order with our waiter. I didn't catch his name because after he brought us our waters and forgot the lemons , we didn't see him for another 45 minutes when he came back to tell us the wings are taking longer than expected. Before he came back I really wanted the lemon and some sweet and low so I asked the girl who was cleaning the table behind us. She really didn't say much she got what I asked her and just dropped them on the table. I think I saw her name to be Kayla. While she was waiting on the table behind us I noticed the lady dropped a bottle of milk for her baby and the lady didn't realize it, I saw Kayla look at it and thought she would pick it up and give it back to the woman. She just walked right past it and ignored it. This girl definitely should not be waiting tables she has a bad attitude. As for my waiter we him once again after we waited an hour for the wings.  The service at this place is horrible. Next time I will go to another BWW or order for take out."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with friends, 6 of us in total. Food was state and hot but the wait staff was slow, they missed our gravy order and messed up one of the orders. This place need to have more attentive staff."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The food is always delicious and we love using the enclosed patio to host business events."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and have always enjoyed everything about this location. The remodel they recently did has made it even better, definitely check it out!!"}
{"text":"Hosts/hostesses tried to avoid seating us, and the food took an hour long to arrive as well. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"A new place in this town, but they were better off without it.  Service was awful.  People standing around with no eye contact and it wasn't remotely busy. Staff with no training on the beers they had or what was on the menu.  The bartender that served me was way too interested in looking for young guys at the bar more than actually serving anyone.  Yes this is a chain, but the manger here needs to do some work."}
{"text":"Went to Buffalo Wild Wings in Ajax tonight to celebrate my birthday. What happens...the waiter ends up spilling an entire glass of Diet Pepsi into and on top of my $500 Michael Kors purse and all the waiter and manager can say is sorry. Heard from 2 district managers and all they were willing to do is have it cleaned.  The purse, etc was not even 3 months old!  Bad service by all I defiantly won't return!"}
{"text":"I'm here right now, and I've been waiting for about 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge. No one has asked me for drinks in here with a co worker and about 5 different people have passed by and made no eye contact. So I'm walking out thank you BWW I didn't want to pay for horrible service"}
{"text":"When all else fails, hit the BWW. Ya, even in Vegas! Off the strip and away from most of the chaos. Great place to sit back and relax.."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here today service was great food hot and fresh I had chicken Cesar salad 3 others with me had cheese burgers and fries our iced teas were constantly full we never had to ask for anything refills napkins or the check service and food spot on so for a quick bar food place with tons of TV's all on sports you can't miss the location was spotlessly clean we all were satisfied no complaints here"}
{"text":"good wings! i come every thursday on wing night. service has been lacking a little lately. its like pulling teeth to get refills on drinks other than that food is always awesome!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Buffalo Wild Wings in Madison! You can always count on their food being just what you expected, where as other locations are hit or miss. The service is always pretty decent. They have many T.V's so you can watch a game or follow multiple games. They also offer trivia, which is sometimes fun to play if your going to be there for a few hours. Tuesdays is 45 cent wing night and Thursday is 60 cent (Can't remember how much?) boneless wing night. They offer Coke products which makes me sad, but I can get over it, because their wings are soooo good. My favorite sauces: Medium and Asian Zing!"}
{"text":"My past experiences at B Dubs have always been quite delicious, enjoyable and often for dinner. Today, I decided to try it out for lunch with my boyfriend. The disappointment began with our disinterested host who unfortunately ended up as our server. Not only did he did not propose any lunch specials or wing specials to us at the beginning of our experience, but he never mentioned his name or welcomed us in. He impatiently took our order and snatched away the specials menu while my boyfriend was still looking at it. We typically eat at B Dubs for the specials so this was a tad frustrating. Our food was brought to us by a kind food runner, but our server did not return to the table for check ins. Finally, he dropped the check without stopping at the table or saying a word. After about 20 minutes of us waiting for him to return for the check, I said \"excuse me\" as he walked by. He ignored me and continued walking, but thank goodness for another server who overheard me and tended to our closing needs. Our server failed to complete our payment with a gift card until a manager stepped in. I saw our server roll his eyes towards me and our table two or more times during our 70 minute, \"lunch rush\" experience. Disappointed and frustrated is an understatement. I hope this man is not your server in the near future.   Food was still pretty good though, thus the second star being added."}
{"text":"Sunday Night Football is a must here. Good food and excellent customer service.   My husband and I came in here last Sunday night and we sat at the bar. Kendall was our bartender and he was great! He made sure we were taken cared of and he constantly checked up on us, excellent customer service. Mary was also our server and she was extremely sweet. My husband and I ordered the Bayou Po'Boy, BBQ Pulled Pork Tacos, and a large order of wings. I definitely recommend the Tacos, they're so yummy. Yay for BWWs :)"}
{"text":"Ordered wings through yelp which ended up somehow serviced by grubhub and after hour and a half gave up hope and called and asked to cancel the order and decided to go pick up myself. The worst possible service received by a trashy  disgruntled racist  bartender at this location on Hualapai, after walking in we asked if we can pick up our food and received no acknowledgement of our existence and we were told to wait patiently until he finished counting his change and afterwards told us to step aside and patiently wait until he is done. After asking another employee we were immediately serviced. The food was mediocre so would rather order from another local joint were people are happy and have better food and customer service."}
{"text":"I love B Dubs!  ThIs location has some of the friendly staff I have seen. The managers know me because I am in there so much so I guess it is time to bust out the disguise. :). I took one star off because the last few times I ordered my wings, they have not been consistent with size or taste. I get the boneless because sometimes I am lazy and don't want to take the work to eat the chicken off the bone. The boneless pieces range from golf ball size to the size of a nickel and no, I am not kidding. We always order from here and my order is always spot on, all the way down to the ranch and silverware. It gets packed on big game days so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"Seated promptly - 1 star.  Everything else was crap. 20 minutes without even a hello... have no idea who was our server :/ lots of other servers at tables around us and nothing. The common proactive courtesy when you see someone trying to make eye contact and wave someone down \"Hi, has someone taken your order yet? Let me find your server for you.\"  But no one said a word to us.  We walked out - 3 people said thanks guys have a great day...  uh???? Never served. Still hungry. Never again."}
{"text":"B dubs definitely one of my favorite sporting bars in Tempe. Has some very nice selection of chicken wings boneless chicken wings and chicken sandwiches!"}
{"text":"New fun spot for karaoke on Sundays and Tuesdays (they start at 11PM). The words are up on the big screens all around (making it fun for all to sing along) and the drinks are pretty cheap, too ($2 drafts and shots).   For anyone who really likes to sing multiple times in a night, this is the spot (I put on a mini concert and everyone was very cool!)."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for family dinner weekly.  The servers and managers are awesome and treat everyone like family...  there is nothing but food vibes at buffalo wild wings on Horzion."}
{"text":"Nope. We usually do the metro center location, but the last few times we've been giving this one a shot. We've been getting marginal service, but whatever we don't expect much. Nope! Not anymore - especially with our experience tonight. We got there an hour before close, which I get could be frustrating but we knew what we wanted right away - like I said, we frequent BWW. I ordered my wings by 11:20 and asked for them extra wet. Anna, our waitress, kind of gave me a look and said ok. Sorry I interrupted her putting up all the bar stools 40 minutes before closing even though there were several tables with people still. My wings got to me pretty fast, like 6 or 8 minutes. They were dryer than I have ever seen them. Before she even left our table I asked her if these were extra wet, she said \"well, I rung them in right and the sticker is on there so the cooks think they are, it's probably because it's close to closing and they're cleaning.\" Really? And then she offered to bring me more sauce, and I told her the sauce is cold and that wouldn't work. So she leaves and then brings me sauce anyway. I told her it wasn't going to work. And she avoided our table until near closing, I asked her to take the wings off my bill because it was too dry and not what I wanted. She immediately began saying it wasn't her fault and she put the order in right. I didn't say it had anything to do with her. But she was needlessly defensive, she walked off while I was in mid-sentence. Not ok! I get the cooks make the food, my problem is with how she handled it. She brought the check to me and asked me if I was paying with cash or card, rushing me, and then quickly went to ring me out.   On the other hand, the ranch here is the best that I've had at any other BWW!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Seriously, this is the worst Buffalo Wild Wings I've been to. Our server was very over the top and it often came off as rude. She was very sassy and often would ignore us for her passing co worker. It wasn't busy when we were there but our service was so slow.  I should have known better than coming to this location. I wrote a review before regarding the service, but I can't seem to find it.   When we came here last month to pick up a To-go order, it took about 5 minutes before the servers and host finished their conversation to pay attention to us. I figured it was an off night, so we decided to give this location another chance. After both of the experiences here, we definitely will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Take out superb help. I don't eat in he restaurant as much, but when I do, I've had friendly nice wait staff. Actually a great rule they do when they show you your food. If something looks wrong or missing, they don't roll eyes and actually help with a smile.  The BWW on marketplace by the Sams Club, they will roll your eyes and make you regret going there. That review is for that restaurant, good job savoy BWW."}
{"text":"Have no idea why it is, but this BWW food is awful compared to the BWW in savoy. Seriously, I've ordered take out from both places, same days at same times, AND the same meal to experiment. The controls are the same (as stated previously) and my variable is the BWW (marketplace/savoy). The marketplace BWW wings look old, terrible, and practically have no sauce and 2 weren't edible. The takeout crew just seem to be there for the paycheck, no greetings, standing around. I had to ask for help; which is fine but comparing to the savoy BWW, they all greet you and ask if you've been helped. I refuse to go to the BWW on marketplace and will go to savoy. Again, don't understand why such a huge difference when it's the same company 6 miles apart."}
{"text":"First of all, we were a group of 9. We weren't picky on eating inside or outside, we just wanted to get a bite and catch a early movie. It was a Friday night & of course it's going to be busy. We specifically told the hostess whatever becomes available (inside/outside on the patio) is fine with us. When we arrived the patio was empty. Then we noticed people just passing by being seated. There were about 5 hostesses just standing behind the desk gigging, laughing and gossiping. Nobody came to let us know how much longer it's going to be. We were basically invisible! We talked to the manager and he apologized we were to be seated right away, by then the patio that was empty was now completely full.. It took 45 minutes to get a seat. And after we got upset, then the hostesses finally started working and letting people know how much time it would take to be seated. The music played inside is way too loud it was like waiting in line to get into a club for 45 mins."}
{"text":"I usually love BW3s, but this was our first time to the Avon Lake location. They were promoting a grand reopening so my husband & I thought it would be fun to go. Waitress was very nice but the kitchen wait was completely unacceptable. Took 75 min to get our wings appetizer and more than 2 hours to get our dinner!!!! And once the food came it was terrible! Won't be back here again. Also tons of kids here...not the typical BW3s atmosphere. I guess to be expected in the suburbs but weren't expecting rugrats running around everywhere (even in the bar area). Should have gone to Cafe Melissa next door."}
{"text":"Been to this location several times.  Always a fan of the boneless wings lunch specials, especially with the chips instead of fries.  I've gotten burgers here before too but that was disappointing.  That said the service leaves a lot to be desired.  There will be a 2-1 ratio of staff to customers and it will still be slow getting food/drinks.  Food gets 3 stars, service gets 1."}
{"text":"I Live right next to this place and everytime that i go there it is great service food and a great time."}
{"text":"First time I've ever been to this location after moving to the area. My experience here was less then none. I ordered the garden crasher, it comes out with no hummus, no carrots or celery, and about 2 slices of lousy cucumbers, then the pita chips. I had to ask for all of my missing items , which being in the industry for 10 years, that dish should have not even left the kitchen missing that much! The server didn't even acknowledge the dishes lack of  items and then proceeded to return to tell me that they are out of hummus. He asked if I wanted to order something else so I got the naked tenders with a veggie boat, and he took away the lacking dish. He brought out the veggie boat, and about 15 mins go by with no tenders. My party was completely done eating when mine new dish came out. The naked tenders were terrible! I tried to suck it up and like them and not complain again, but I just couldn't do it. They were slimy and had a rubbery appearance and tasted gosh awful. Finally after 3 bites I couldn't do it anymore and informed the server. The server was very apologetic but the visit was an honest and complete fail. I left still hungry, and not one manager even came to apologize. It was a Saturday morning around 1130/12 pm so it was not even busy. Upon leaving we were not even said goodbye to and there were about 3 or 4 employees up front. I even held the door open for an employee that was leaving and he did not even say thank you or anything ! Long story short we will NOT be back. Stay far away, it isn't worth your time or money."}
{"text":"The hostess was very rude upon seating, I wish I would've got her name. A group of friends and myself walked in and were looking for a friend that had already been seated (there was 7 of us) and when we found her, we went to go sit. The hostess comes by a few minutes later and her attitude was very nasty and let's us know that \"next time we come in, we can't just seat ourselves, we have to wait to be seated\" and just by her tone of voice and the way she stared at us ticked me off. We were looking for our friend that was already seated so her rudeness was completely uncalled for, she didn't apologize for her attitude and just continued to say \"next time, you can't just seat yourselves\". If you have such an attitude, maybe you shouldn't work in the customer service field, go somewhere else. The waitress was overall nice to us and our food was fresh and hot, so thank you to the nice waitress that helped us out after that nasty hostess."}
{"text":"Leonora was an amazing server! Very nice and very out going. Very knowledgeable for someone who just started at a new store. Food was good, as usual. This store looks great. I love the new look that all the new stores are going for. Congrats Mark!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is a typical chain and the food is as expected. Two of my favorite sauces here are the Mango Habanero and Caribbean Jerk.   The dining area at this location has a ton of TVs of various sizes and most seats in the dining area have a good view. However, make sure not to get the corner booth near the stuffed animal claw machines. Some of your guests will not be able to see the TVs at all. I recommend asking to switch if you get placed there.  The service at this location is quite poor and the restaurant seems to be running at very low efficiency. To start, the hosts do not greet or even address customers as they arrive. There seem to be a ton of servers in the dinning area, but you never see any of them working. Instead, they stand around in pairs talking. Meanwhile, our food took about 15 minutes to arrive, which seems unreasonable for a fried appetizer and 10 of their trademark wings. Lastly, we only saw our server twice. One time was when we placed our order and the second (much to her fury) was when I had to walk our check up to the front of the restaurant to pay."}
{"text":"Online ordering needs a lot of work. I placed an order 51 minutes early (had to move the pick-up time later due to traffic) for a 5:00 PM pickup. It's now 5:11 PM and my food still isn't ready. While this problem isn't limited to the Cox Road location of BW3, it does appear to be worse here than other locations."}
{"text":"Had Katie as the bartender & she was awesome. Very attentive & held great convo.  Great food & drinks.  Just moved to the area so this will def be a go to for us."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this location and restaurants in general. I've only had 2 bad experiences since I first started going to Buffalo Wild Wings. It was never about their services but with their food. Until recently when my boyfriend took me out after work. We got there around 11:30pm knowing they close at 1am and stop serving at 12am. We get in and order right away no need to look at the menu but since we had first walked in the manger was starring us down the entire way to our table. He also started at me as I was waking towards the bathroom. I felt very uncomfortable. As I was walking back I passed him for the second time And heard him apologizing to the waitress about us walking in. As a manger myself I understand how sucky it is to have someone walk in last minute. On the other hand I don't think starting us down was the best option. We may have been  the last ones in but we aren't the last ones out.  Plus, I always clean up the table and stack everything neatly for the waitresses and tip generously."}
{"text":"WINGS!!! Who doesn't love wings? Well I don't when it takes over 30 minutes for the waiter or waitress to come visit the table and over an hour for the food to get to us. Overall though the workers were polite,but they don't seem to understand what the meaning of extra wet sauce is unfortunately."}
{"text":"I got the mild boneless wings they were below average fries dry and crusty. Service was extremely bad women forgot about us most of the time and was all over the place. Bad experience"}
{"text":"It's oh so very rare that the ducks and packers plays at the same time! BW is out spot every time we gotta watch a game! However we were in town for the weekend and man oh man I am so so so disappointed.  Shout out to our waitress who ran the whole bar area! Poor girl she had to work her butt off to take care of everyone.  However we did get our orders wrong, no drinks for almost half an hour, waited so long for our food that we were almost gonna go to the kitchen ourselves...... My favorite ultimate nachos barely had anything on it, no sauce, no substance......  Please properly stuff your team and make sure the kitchen doesn't cut corners."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting, dirty, and there excuse is because \"the employees are young\" I have NEVER been to this location without receiving dirty food in my water."}
{"text":"The best chicken wings however you want it but my ultimate favorite is Asian Zing and Mango Habanero, the spicy, sweet, salty and tangy taste of the sauce  covering a crispy chicken wing doest it all...  I can survive eating it all day and all night long since they are open 24 hrs.  And specially Tuesdays is their chicken wings day that gives a great deal even more!!!"}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place. Wait staff flat out refused to serve me. They were too busy arguing over whose turn it was to wait on customers and I stood there for 10 minutes at the host podeum while they argued. Then they all left and ignored the customers. This is what happens when you employ 21 year old blond bimbos to run your restaurant."}
{"text":"Came in on my day off and I'm not sure who my server was but she was awful. Apparent she didn't care about her job or my food.... Food finally came out and couldn't eat it fresh because I had no silverware....for 15 min.... My wings were drenched in this sauce/gel and about raw. My salad was rancid and I wish I could have complained, but my server was gone. So I'll that I had to pay for nasty food and leave hungry....."}
{"text":"I used to love this location. Lately I don't know what is going on. Today as I gave my name to the hostess I was told it would be an hour wait time and then an hour to get my food. The last time I was here the same situation happened and my order came out incorrectly. The food was taken back and I waited another 30 minutes. I eventually just left without getting my complete order and still hungry.  I still had to pay for the food that I never got despite their mistake. There was no way I was going to stick around for that again today. I don't know if they are short-staffed or what but they really need to get their act together."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Minnesota and wanted to watch a Vikings game. We knew that Buffalo Wild Wings would have it. The food is always good. But our server was unbelievably nice and helpful(Krystal). We had a great experience!!!!"}
{"text":"First walked in and no one greeted us. A server even walked right past so I just went and sat myself in the bar tables knowing they're open seating. Our server, Stefani was one of the worst servers I've had before. I think she might of been training because someone was shadowing her but she didn't say a word and neither girl introduced the mysterious follower. There was no engagement no suggesting no anything. Service was slow. Food was no better. I love Bdubs but will never find myself at this location again. Go the extra couple miles and try a new location."}
{"text":"Alison was our server and our experience was mediocre. She had a bit of an attitude and was standoffish. It was an hour before. close so I'm sure that had something to do with it. Our 10 wings took 25 minutes. I had to fill my own water glass and another table in her section got their own napkins. However, the manager (I really wish I knew his name) was very attentive and apologetic when I told him how we felt. He's the only reason I'm giving this location any stars at all."}
{"text":"This is my regular Buffalo Wild Wings! There are about 3 in Vegas. The one on the strip gets way too crowded & doesn't have as much sauce quality like this location. & the north location is far from me. Buffalo wild wings has some of the best wing sauces I know. I'm a spice lover, so I recommend mango habanero, Thai curry, & spicy garlic. If you're lucky, you can try one of their limited time sauces. For sides, its hard for me to jot order buffalo chips with cheese. They're pretty much good potato sliced wedges. & as for dessert, the typical brownie with vanilla ice cream is satisfying. Although buffalo wild wings is nationally popular, some may not have tried it. Might as well go for it in Vegas! Its not expensive & yummy."}
{"text":"Usually go here for take out, I work down the street. Very clean, service is fast and courteous"}
{"text":"Well it happens again...a nice restaurant, establishment takes advantage. I don't frequent BW3 like some but over years have been quite a but....the last couple times, awful service. Not only of course is everything on menu overpriced, drinks included, and as another mentioned poured short, and yes obviously poured short, you can't  do that! The service is and was Friday April 27th terrible. The atmosphere is not that great when you consider crowded, humid outside after rain, almost 70 deg outside and it actually felt like heat was on.... everyone was perspiring including our waitress. To make worse our wings came without our beer refill and told changing keg? Miller lite? One tap? Ok...never offered alternative or even water, the beer came slid across table without a word as we had finished, at that point I wanted check...period. I always, consistently tip 20-30 percent at the least. Sorry but this waitress got our change and this location lost our families business. Disappointing to say the least....ruined great night out."}
{"text":"I never expect good service from bdubs. Today i came here for lunch with 3 other people. We all ordered off the fast break lunch menu. My BBQ chicken salad came without BBQ sauce. Also the timer had expired for their 15 minute time limit. We were still charged for the food, so I have no idea why they set up the timer in the first place. So if you are thinking of going to bdubs, you shouldn't because they are more focused on setting timers than on getting your food out on time and correctly."}
{"text":"Last time I eat here!!!  My husband picked up a to go order I called in didn't get the 2nd Mac n cheese for my kids. Totally ruined my birthday dinner"}
{"text":"45 cent wings Tuesdays! can't go wrong!  The only problem, expect to be here for a little while. When they are busy they are busy.  Had to wait 1 hr to get the wings.  Other than that the staff are great."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner and watch some college football Friday night. Since we've been here multiple times to watch NFL and MLB we know that good service can be provided even when they're crazy busy.   The bar is seat yourself so we sat and waited and waited for someone to come wipe off our table (it was the only one available) and bring us menus. Not a huge deal since they were super busy.   Our server (who will go unnamed) greeted herself and took our drink orders. I ordered a long-island iced tea since they were on special and I haven't had one in forever. It was HORRIBLE, I have had many Long-Islands in my day and this by far was the worst. It was orange, I think they filled the glass half way with sour mix, added some well liquor even though it was supposed to be top-shelf and forgot the splash of coke. Problem is she brought the drink when she took our food order so I didn't get a chance to drink it until she walked away. Normally, I won't say anything, I'll just down the drink and order something else next time. This was so bad and so sour I couldn't even get it down.   Finally I flagged her down and ordered something else, when I told her I would like to get something else because...well i couldn't finish my sentence because her ADHD took over and away she went. I sat there with my mouth opened wondering if I was even talking out loud (my bf assured me I was). She left the drink on the table so I really wasn't certain she heard me.   Then the food came. I had ordered a create-your-own chicken sandwich with a side salad instead of fries. The sandwich came out exactly as I had ordered. However, I had the wrong dressing for my salad and we had no silverware. She dropped off the food, never asked if we wanted anything else and just took off, I tried stopping her but that was a lost cause.   I sat there looking around, trying to make eye-contact with anyone who was glancing my way. Our server was just standing by the bar chit-chatting. Finally someone walked by and I asked if we could get silverware and ketchup, I had high-hopes she would bring me a fork, but she didn't. So there I sit some more, unable to eat my salad. Finally a manager walked by and I asked him, instead of him grabbing it, he shouted for someone else to do it. YAY, I got a fork. Too bad the dressing was wrong (and not tasty) and no server to ask to correct it. Finally when I'm putting my last bite in my mouth she came over and asked how we're doing. Really? You're going to ask me now? UGH.   Well at this point I'm fed up and while we'll probably go to BW3 in the future, it certainly will not be this location."}
{"text":"Leider ist es extrem laut, man kann sich kaum unterhalten. Die Bedienungen sind sehr freundlich - alles bestens. Wir hatten zu dritt zwei 20er Chickenwings mit Kartoffelecken. Die Kartoffelecken waren sehr lecker!   Geschmacklich waren die Chickenwings leider nicht besonders gut, die Saucen waren wie ein Hammer im Mund, viel zu radikal. Da ist weniger manchmal mehr. Schade, hatte mir mehr versprochen. Werde nicht wieder hingehen."}
{"text":"Chelsea the bartender did an amazing job...recommended awesome wings was personable and just made the experience amazing I usually go to the one on Frank loyd Wright but this will be my new spot for sure"}
{"text":"I have had a couple terrible dining experiences here the last few months. This place and best for take out orders. Whenever I dine in, my wings never have enough sauce. I always ask for extra wet wings, but it's almost impossible to receive this service. Also, the bone in wings are pretty inconsistent in size. Most don't have enough meat, so boneless in are better. The place itself is clean and the servers are nice but they seem busy. I can see myself coming back, but I would probably not order wings.  On the bright side, they do great catering requests. They always put enough sauce in large orders."}
{"text":"We sat outside patio. Waited 10 minutes for service. Then waited 10 minutes to get my beer. Wings came no ranch. When asked again waited. I assumed was the manager in blue button up long sleeve shirt asked how our service was. After telling him how bad service was he made the excuse that waiter had too many tables. Don't see how that is a good reason for our bad service.   Upon leaving manager in blue shirt looked at us but never said bye. Even appeared to be bad mouthing.. This was my worst Buffalo Wild Wings experience. . Thx yelp!"}
{"text":"First off it took us 30 minutes to get drinks when we asked the manager Martin about our drinks he had the server go make them and he apologized but he didn't helper or assist her. It took over an hour and a half for us to finally get our food when I asked the manager why did it take so long he said he was going to go find out what's going on. about 10 mins later our food came out. Other parties that came after us had already had their food and drinks while we still hadn't t even had drinks. When the food came out It's was not like we ordered and the server acted like she had an attitude. It was not crowed at all. I told the server and manger that I am a server as well and that this was very unprofessional and bad customer service.  My friend was upset her order was wrong and the manager tried to give her an excuse on why the whole order was messed up. My friend asked him nicely to just leave her alone because she was upset. And he told her that she needed to leave. I don't know if he thought we were going to continue eating and he kicked her out. But we wasn't. So we all left. We are not from Vegas and bww Vegas have us a very bad experience. It was my friends sister birthday. We will never go back. We thought it would be a cool place to have dinner since we were staying at the Alara upstairs."}
{"text":"2 ice teas in a row so far and brought with lemon when I asked for none. Starting today waitresses get no tip if their listening skills are lacking...."}
{"text":"Maybe their wings are their art, but not impressed with 3 meals one a hamburger a was dry and bland and a wrap had skimpy ingredients the third was not memorable."}
{"text":"I went to this new Buffalo Wild Wings a few weeks after it opened with a friend. We had been shopping (early Christmas shopping), and we were starving. We know BWW to be good, so we headed there.  Sadly, this location was not the greatest. Wait staff took forever to even get a glass of water. Had someone deliver our food and refused to take it back when the wrong order was delivered. She said it was not her problem. We finally had to get a manager to sort out the problem.  The food was fine once the problem was sorted, but the lack of service ruined this review. I love BWW, but I may think twice before coming to this location again!"}
{"text":"Update 4/25/17 - The staff has turned over a lot over the past year. Service has gone way down hill because of it. Slower at getting served. The games are still on and the food is still pretty good.  I would say it it's more like 3 1/2 stars now. A little better than ok but not good enough to be great."}
{"text":"Came at midnight and I ordered food and a beer .  Got my food right now STILL NO FORKS . No napkins . And no drink ? The suck so bad please don't come at night so so so bad"}
{"text":"Really, they have some pretty fantastic wings.  The chicken itself should be rated at 3 stars, but thanks to the amount of flavors they have, it bumps the review up to 4.  They have over 20 different sauces that you can put on your wings.  They also have some special sauces that come and go.  Recently, they have begun serving a Captain Morgan sauce... Let me tell you, even if you are not a fan of the rum, you will be a fan of this sauce.  It's sweet with a little bit of kick, and it's a ton better than their honey barbecue.  Try and come on Tuesdays or Thursdays.  They have Wing Specials these days that make their wings much more affordable... After all I would rather not pay $5.99 for 8 Boneless Wings.  That's outrageous.  If you want delicious wings, look no further."}
{"text":"My colleague and I grab wings from here once a month around 1 and I have no major complaints. There is usually (when we visit) only a few people dining in but the service is still somewhat slow. However, the food is hot and good so I'll take that over slow and cold any day. The staff is nice and one of the cooks introduced me to the salt n vinegar rub wings...surprisingly good."}
{"text":"I ordered Parmesan garlic wings and received a box of sauce with wings in it. Definitely don't like to dine at places that don't appear to care about my food."}
{"text":"YEAH CORPERATE AMERICA. Lame in every sense of the word. Great for sporting events on TV, thats it. I always support the local business when I have too. I went to watch the NCAA championship at HOB but some how they lost their liquor license. WTF? I had a beer and got out of there as fast as I could. I rather eat cheerios at home."}
{"text":"Got a honey bbq chicken salad for a to go order. When they initially brought the 2 salads out they didn't put double chicken on it. I politely let them know what my order was supposed to have. They took it back and then brought them back out. The salads now had 2 different looking types of chicken which wasn't a big deal until I tasted it when I got home. The original chicken on the salad tasted HORRIBLE and I threw it away. If that wasn't bad enough I got a very upset stomach within 2 hours of eating the salad. Definitely not coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"Multiple times I've placed take-out orders and it's taken 40 plus minutes to receive my simple order of chicken wings. THAT'S THEIR SPECIALTY WINGS!!!!! It should never take that long to get an order of wings. On occasions I've tried to order a beer there while I wait and was given excuses as to why the keg was clogged. I've mentioned to the manager several times my displeasure in their speed and service. Nothing was ever done to make things better. Avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"Perfect sports getaway during your getaway!  We wanted to actually hear the game and the casino sports bars that offered that - and that were not booked - were hard to come by.   Here's why you should go here: - If you have Natasha as you're waitress you're already  winning. She was super nice, attentive, and fun. She tried to organize her tables so everyone knew who was cheering for what team so there'd be friendly trash-talking. (My husband appreciated that!)  - Food was good. I had a salad. (Don't judge, needed greens so my body wouldn't collapse from Vegas fun.) Then had the garlic parm wings and the lemon wings. So good and perfect amount of crispiness.  - We were seated quickly and our server was there right away.  - Screens! Big screens everywhere, it's glorious!  - Bathrooms are clean!  The ONLY negative is that there are no free coffee refills. We were charged for each cup we had. I get it, we should be drinking beer in Vegas. But coffee is crucial to recovery. :-)  Go here as 2 people or a group, but call ahead if you're a group."}
{"text":"It's a chain folks!  Nothing spectacular, but for any of their daily specials and/or Happy Hour deals, just get in the car and go!  FANTASTIC PLACE to sit back and watch a game; which ranges from hockey, baseball, basketball, all at the same time.  Wide variety of beers to choose from and you KNOW what you're getting.  Small problem with my order, but was quickly remedied and staff/manager came by to check-in.  A nice place to just shoot a couple of hours and connect with friends or after work comrades."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent this location - and always love it! The staff and FAST and FRIENDLY. That in itself is worth it. Plus, always amazing food. Often it is pretty loud, making it hard to have conversation, and there are a ton of TVs to look at, also distracting. But the staff and food overweight that and make it worth it. Definitely recommend you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  We go do the trivia, the food is great and the staff is always friendly!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally friendly staff each time I have been there, lots of TVs with lots of different options, wrestling, baseball, football, the leafs losing etc.   My wife tried a flavour of wings that was too hot and they brought her out another flavour free of charge, waiters came by frequently to check on us, and we never had to ask for refills. After tip came to around $50 for two of us, no alcohol, just two meals and drinks, but worth it to me. I always look forward to my next visit. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming to b dubs for wings when they first came to town forever ago but it seems that they have consistently been bad the last couple times I've been here. I always get the caribbean jerk sauce on my wings, but the wings taste overdone or too crispy. The app platter was very salty. My other disappointment was they advertised that they had woodchuck amber, but the waitress says \"oh that menu is wrong, don't pay attention to that\" uh ok, update maybe? Maybe my waistline will thank me that I'm no longer a chix wing fan."}
{"text":"The one in Yuma, AZ was better. I had honey BBQ wings for appetizer, which were OK at best. For dinner had black and bleu burger. Didnt read menu close enuff, I guess. For $9 I got a \"slider\" with bleu cheese dressing squirted on it. The bun was tastey...more of a dinner roll, actually. The burger was disgusting....like it was baked or microwaved or somthing. Service was friendly but slow. Took them 5 minutes to make a gin/tonic while at 40% capacity. The only thing that will drag me back into one of these restaurants is a mandatory work function. A shame since I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"my first experience with buffalo wild wings. ordered an unsweetened iced tea. waitress \"chucked \"it on my table 5 minutes later. No sugar , no lemon , just a plain ole glass of lipton iced tea. Waited another 5 minutes for her to return so i could ask for sugar , and anothe 5 minutes to actually get the sugar. my son ordered a burger , I ordered wings with 3 different sauces. the menu looked nearly identical to the menu i had seen bofore  at quaker steak and lube. the result . the burger was a pattie that I could pick up at the local grocery store. the fries were the shoestring type that you normally get at the top 2 fast food joints. the wings, my local American Leigion has a much better product for a fraction of the cost. all in all, the service was mediocer at best , for the food was filling but kinda pricey for basic \"fast food\""}
{"text":"I was at BWs i thought the bartender Mike was so rude to me? when he brought the wings to us ?it was cold?when i confronted him about it?he acted like he didnt care? he gave me a dirty look? l went to BWs many year? this is the first time i was treated it this way? i wont go back to this location?"}
{"text":"Some friends said that this place has \"the best wings ever\" so being the conoseiur that I am, I had to try it.   The wings tasted like.... sauce. That's all I could taste. I tried the garlic and the honey bbq, and was not impressed by either. The garlic is too hot and overpowers the flavor of the chicken. The honey bbq was a good sauce (not too sweet like a lot of places) but they just put so much on that it was dripping off the wings.  They have a lot of beers to choose from... but its all pilsner trash. PBR and Bud and the like. It's a sports bar place, not my type of atmosphere."}
{"text":"my 2nd time there tonight. Pluses: Our server from the first time remembered us - very nice guy. I like the tasting samplers you can get, the free trivia game and the Tue/Thu specials. BTW, there is NO blue cheese in the extra-charge dressing. The food sounds better than it actually is - not bad, just not great. All in all I guess this is damning with faint praise. I like to look forward to restaurants. Lots of tvs and neon beer signs - I get a nagging premonition that loud sports bars like this will be featured in the Smithsonian some day as an example of our 21st century consumerism ...  oh well, it's close to home and my husband likes it ..."}
{"text":"When we first arrived, we were greeted by a \"host.\"  We passed a group of servers bunched up socializing.  We were seated and told that our server would be right with us.  There was a drink menu on the table that was sticky and stuck to the table.  We ordered two apps off the happy hour menu.  They were good.  We ordered a burger to share and specified no sauce on it, but hot on the side.  The fries were to be super well done.  When the burger came out, the steak meat on it was so salty that we couldn't eat it.  (We were sharing the several dishes.)  The fries were barely warm and not crispy.  When we finally got our server's attention, she apologized and asked if we wanted something else or another on.  We wanted another one.  She also said that she would let the manager know.  Twenty minutes later, the new one came out.  It was just as salty as the first one and now had hot sauce slathered all over it.  The fries were cold and soggy.   A manager never came over.  When we got the bill that we had to ask, we were charged for two burgers, but it was caught and taken off.  Interestingly, a manager never came over to say anything.  The server saw that we left the burger and we were still charged for it. We told each other that we were never returning.  blah"}
{"text":"My family and I have always loved Buffalo Wild Wings. The food is great, there is something to watch, there are tablets for my kids to play on for entertainment, and the food is fresh and hot every single time. The servers are usually very nice and prompt when you order. My rating was lowered this time because my server, Luis, as kind and friendly as he was, forgot to redeem my reward from my bill and I had to pay an extra $9 for my lunch break. The Blazin Rewards is a benefit to those that are at BDubs a lot and get rewarded for doing so. But I told Luis I had a coupon, he even took my number down so I could redeem it, but he didn't redeem it.  On the plus side, now next time we go we will be having the ultimate nachos for FREE instead of this time."}
{"text":"Waiting STILL ( it is already 40 minutes) for 5 wings & one quesadilla..... Really? Wonder how much more to wait. At least for a drink had to wait about 10 minutes..... Ah, what a service!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The wings are pretty bad, the service was terrible, but might be a great place to sit at the bar and watch a sports game. Don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here often....we enjoy their selection of wing flavors and the service is always excellent...it also fun to play the interactive trivia games, which we wind up playing for hours.              They have new flavors every couple months from the BWW sauce labs, which are always fun to try.  Very friendly people in a family friendly atmosphere... Definately one of our favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Yikes. Found a hair in my food.. was NOT what i was expecting with my wings for dinner.."}
{"text":"I cant get enough of there medium spicy boneless wings.  They are my favorite in town.    There lunch specials make the please more reasonable."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come every Tuesday. Today, we waited over an hour and a half for food and still waiting at the moment. Not one person has come to us to apologize."}
{"text":"The service here always sucks and the food is mediocre. Waited 10 minutes in the bar area without being greeted so we asked for a table, where we waited another 15 minutes before the hostess finally took our drink order. The appetizer came out a little burnt, with the wrong dipping sauce, and the wings came out at room temp. It was two hours before close and the waitress had about 3 other tables. She was very apologetic about the wait, but there is simply no good reason to leave a party of two waiting 25 minutes for water. We live in the desert. Next time I'll go to Hooters across the street."}
{"text":"We were very excited this opened but have had a few repeated bad take out experiences. Basically the cooks don't know their menu and added Caesar dressing to the crispy chicken wraps we ordered on three different occasions. The last time was the last straw. Don't trust your takeout order and check everything! We drove back and they remade everything but comped us on our 'next meal'. I doubt there will be a next time. Sad bc this is a cool sports bar but I have other choices.  Update. Went for lunch and had great food and service. BW3 your stock is rising just in time for Football season!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Been here about 15 mins and haven't been helped it's literally empty here. I ordered take out an hour ago. I would understand if they were busy but there's literally no one here. On top of that the food was cold when I got it. Update: When the manager contacted me about my experience, he tried arguing with me. He told me that the dining room closes after a certain time and that I needed to get my food from the bar area. I did approach the bar area because I noticed that everyone was over there and I just wanted to get my food and leave but all employees ignored me and so did the manager that was working that night. It took me about 30 mins to finally get someone's attention. Side note; I'm under 21 and legally cannot be in that area. He did offer to replace less than what I had originally paid for the last meal. (I paid $30 for the previous meal and he offered to replace $20.) When I ordered for pick up again, I got yelled at by the bartender when I called to tell him that I was at the door but it was locked. He was completely disrespectful (and again they weren't busy) and he wasnt nice to me until after I told him that the manager had left me a $20 credit. Worst Buffalo Wild Wings ive ever been to. I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"What a great meal I had here today! Awesome tasting wings at only 70 cents per wing and for the quality it was fantastic. The salt & pepper, lemon pepper and mango habanero wings were all absolutely perfect. Great service from our waiter who was on it from start to finish earning a well deserved 50 percent tip. I'll be back soon my friends."}
{"text":"Ashley always does right by us... she kills it every time!!! Love hanging here on Thursday nights with my friends as Ashley keeps us cracking up and is on point with refills and service!"}
{"text":"We continue to dine at this location as it is near our home.  We have had mediocre experiences, but for the most part this is what we expect at a Buffalo Wild Wings.   Tonight we decided to order wings to go. We arrived to pick up the wings at the time the restaurant suggested. We went straight home (about a 5 minute drive) and our food was cold. This was disappointing."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was pretty good! They changed the nearest tv to the Supercross race for us and that was a plus. We really enjoyed the new Santa fe sauce and I wish I got that on my wings instead of the spicy garlic! Other than my not so good choice in sauce, we had a great experience :)"}
{"text":"I see lots of negative reviews and I don't get it. It's a sports bar not a 5 star restaurant. They have great wings with tons of flavor choices, one of the best happy hours around and tons of TV's. They also have the baseball package so you can watch any game. For a Texas Ranger fan in AZ, that's important.  The beer is always ice cold and the place is one of the cleaner BWW I've been too. I love the big screen right over the bar. It's huge!!  During happy hour you can get the street tacos for $4 and they are really good. The fried pickles and chili queso dip is really good too.  Oh yea...free WiFI."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent customer service here. Come here for all your football, baseball, and family fun nights. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"These guys know me too well. As soon as I hit 21, I hit up the place after work far more often than I should. This Buffalo Wild Wings has great service all over the restaurant, the food is always fresh, and the drinks are amazing! The staff is super friendly and always on the ball. No complaints from this Yelper!"}
{"text":"My experience here today was terrible. I brought my daughter because she was in the mood of wings. So we ordered some wings and some chili queso fries. When we got the fries we did not get any forks and i had to wait for ten minutes for them to bring some. Hen we waited 40 min for the wings to arrive and when they did they were cold. I asked to talk to the manager and it took another 20 min for the manager to show up and all he said was IM SORRY. This location is a total disaster i should have checked the reviews here before we came!!"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic, but I only scared us a little bit because they were cop sitting by us. We all ordered the wings and the wings were delicious, as always. The waiter actually kept checking on us, which is unusual at this location from the last few times we came. You could never go wrong with the traditional wings, I what makes it better is that now they have lunch break specials. I didn't understand what the lunch break special was, but now that I know what it is after our visit, you get your food for free if it takes them 15 minutes to get your food. So next time, you know for sure we're going during lunch and we're gonna use that timer to see if we can get free food.  We got the hot and mild buffalo wings, Southwest onion rings were always good, and of course the little tablets for the kids to play on, It kept them occupied while we waited. Will definitely come back, always looking toward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I visit this location more than other BWW locations within the Valley. It's a bit more spacious, friendlier and pleasant than other BWW locations. I would recommend this location if you're getting lunch during the week because they participate in the \"fast break\" service. If you don't get your lunch within 15 mins or less it's free. They have a tablet and timer that is placed at your table to keep track of the time. Majority of the time my lunch is out within 5-10 mins.   Here's how I did my review: + Quick service. + Food is out quick. + Your server can change a channel to a game that you want to watch. + Friendliness. + Lunch menu. + Fast Break participation (some BWW don't participate.)   + Option to sit outside. There's a non-smoking and smoking area in different sitting areas. + Outside heaters. + They do military discount.  + If you save your receipt and do their online survey. You get $5 off your next visit if it's $25 or more.  - Restrooms tend to be out of tissue, paper towels and soap on and off whenever I visit. - The booths have very bouncy sits. They seem very old and not comfortable.  - Servers tend to ignore you after you pay and tip."}
{"text":"Just gotta get a bunch of wings on game day every now and then and this is my go to place, although it's just A OK. Nothing too exciting to write about. They have a ton of TV's going but I wondered how to get them to let us hear a certain TV -- but wasn't interested in the game enough to ask. I remember a sports bar that had a little speaker on your table and you could tune into whatever TV you wanted to hear but I didn't see anything what-so-ever like that here . Asian Zing wings are the best....sweet/spicy"}
{"text":"Went back after the owner replied to my review. Actually went back twice. First time we were treated like royalty because we showed them the credit we had for past poor experience. Second time found a hair and charged for extra drinks but Sky the manager was super friendly.    Third time one month later...  I try so hard to like this BDUBS.  Unfortunately it's just about impossible. Second time I have been charged twice for a drink that the server messed up. No kidding second time had hair in the nachos!!!!  Third time I got the check and was charged for other tables food.  Bottom line the place is managed poorly. The staff means well but the training has got to be non-existent. Honestly why not just get hair nets?  Why is it so hard to just take the Pepsi off the tab and replace with a sprite?  Why does it seem the servers are given bonuses for highest sales instead of customer service grades?  Why does it take 18 minutes for nachos only to be delivered cold with the rest of the food at the same time!!!  Why thanks, I love having my nachos and my burger at the same time.  How thoughtful.  I hope the best for the franchise however, won't be surprised if this location doesn't make it to football season.  Obviously, I wrote this review realizing it's no fine dining experience.   I'm upset about simple issues and simple commonsense every day restaurant service being performed terribly.  That said hope you can figure out how to turn your place around owner/franchisee. Best wishes."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!!! My husband my lil boy and I went to grab dinner and the waiter can n took our order and we waited a hour!!!! And still didn't get out food even if busy as a waitress you talk to the people let them know it's going to be a wait bt she did no such thing we got up to leave and still didn't get our food which we had already paid for n left tip the manager canceled our order and the bitch of a waitress kept my tip after a asked for it back"}
{"text":"B-Dubs rocks! Being from Ohio, the birthplace of this chain, I love coming here. Tons of TV's playing every game, great wings, and a great environment."}
{"text":"Came on 4th of july was naked in here but food was hot dark as hell in there nice place if taking a ugly chic"}
{"text":"It's eh. There are better Sport's Bars in Vegas. Some kid at the table across from me in the dining area spat a spit ball at me the first time we went there. We decided to give the place another shot. At the second try, the waitresses were annoyed that I switched tables twice and ended up wanting to sit in the bar area. I was super apologetic about it. I just wanted to watch the game I was there for and the bar had a better view. We didn't order anything yet, so that's why I switched before we started ordering. They weren't happy."}
{"text":"I love this place on game night. I have a ton of screens I can watch, tasty food to snack on, and kind people to serve me. I have spent a few game nights here and I appreciate the staff just letting me hang out and nibble. They have never rushed me out. I appreciate you guys. Thanks."}
{"text":"Holy food poison alarm! how the hell do u screw up chicken wings, u fried the crap out of it and sauce it.  Well not only the food was terrible the management is even worst, although we tip the server genourously only because the management seems to treat them terribly.  I think their GM's name is kyler aka mega douche, i have always liked BWW but the fact they hired this piece of human garbage make me rethink their company values.  Hopefully they can change things around and get rid of this turd eating moron."}
{"text":"Bruh, I will straight inhale 7 baskets of these wings and not give AF. This shit be bumpin son. I would lose half my pinky finger for a bucket of these MFs right now. Them Garlic Parmesan are clutch and uncontested by any wing joint in the world."}
{"text":"OK, I am writing this as a \"converted\" wing eater. I have never cared for wings but after eating here, I'm hooked! what can I say, the food and service were great! Servers are always available, yet they do not bug you. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered 8 boneless wings and a side of veggies. I received 10 wings and was charged for all 10 which barely had any sauce on them and the order of veggie sticks was literally two carrots and two celery pieces. Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Took advantage of boneless Thursday and ordered some take out wings. Holy crap they were huge!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 20 wings via doordash delivery. Picked two sauces, they made a 1/3 of the wings one flavor and 2/3 the other flavor. Opened up one of the boxes to find my boneless wings swimming in sauce...bite into them and realize why...they were bone dry. Now I see why they have 2/5 stars. The doordash app doesn't tell you the yelp review. Would have never touched it if I saw 2/5. Won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"We live right down the street from west gate and usually on football Sunday's buffalo is the place to go without a doubt but lately I have noticed that they're getting really bad with their customer service and with the food , I just went and picked up some wings like 10 minutes ago and when I got home and looked at the wings they were as dry as the damn desert we live in . We ordered a large boneless and a small boneless and they only gave us 2 ranches . This will most likely be the last time we go to buffalo ."}
{"text":"This is one of the biggest BWW's I have ever been in and a large number of T.V.'s. That's the good part. Our waitress: I think her name tag said \"Tiyanna\" or close. (Hard to see) she must have forgot to take her memory pills because she just kept forgetting everything. We were waiting and waiting for our fried pickles before the main course but it never came. When our regular meal came I mentioned it now she's all apologetic: \" oh, I'm so sorry I forgot. I'll bring them to you now\". Other than that, the food was good and I watched UFC on one of the big screens."}
{"text":"A place you don't want to return to. The bartender told me not to come back, because he makes all his money on the slots. I sat with my friends at the bar, unaware we needed to play the slot machines. I ordered drinks and food.   I felt very unwelcome to be here. Doug approach was terrible. One of the worst bar I have been to in 10 years."}
{"text":"Loud, over priced and service is slooooooooooooooow.  Pretty sure grass grows faster then getting out of the kitchen. This is my 2nd time coming to this location, and both times I must have been the lucky winner of the day, because the server I got must be getting better tips from coworkers then me because she sure was making sure her coworkers were having a good time and pretty much not giving a flying rats ass about me. All those other tables that got refills and friendly service and food coming to them hot and fast, just don't have the luck that I got, or any of the other tables she was \"serving\" Fool me once Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"This was actually not the first time my husband and I had dinner at Buffalo Wild Wings. If I remember correctly, I might have gone there 5 other times or more but back when I was not a very active Yelper, hence the 1 check in only!  In all the times we went there we had wings, fries or potato wedges and soft drinks. In all the times we went there everything was perfect, food and service. The last time we went there however was a long time ago now, months back. The reason we didn't go back was that they changed the coleslaw dressing and it was so acidic, with such spicy wings my stomach was on fire to the point where I felt sick. I used to use the coleslaw as a cooling aid for the spice in the wings!   This time we decided to change and try some of their sandwiches. I ordered a chicken po-boy and my husband ordered the Southwest Philly. Both were great but honestly too small! We were finished in about 5 min after the food arrived. I mean if I'm gonna pay over $10 bucks for a sandwich, I expect to feel full! Maybe I was super hungry but I wish the sandwich was bigger.   Overall it was a good experience. We were seated immediately (we were lucky cause a little while after that, the line was almost out the door). The restaurant was packed at 6 and the service although was very good, the food was slow, took about 20 min or more for it to come out. We will definitely go again and try to order the wings and coleslaw again (cause they are actually more filling) hoping that over the past few months, they realized the original dressing worked much better with their wings!"}
{"text":"Always call in for pick up, right by the house normally a ten to fifteen minute wait. Great wings good amount of sauces. Always have had good wings here."}
{"text":"Ended up having dinner here with my best friend. Was a 20 minute wait for a table but there was a hockey game so that would be no fault of Buffalo's. Seated out on the patio, which is pretty nice and comfy. Lot's of televisions and faced the court yard so we were able to hear and see the live band.   But their food and service sucked. I can understand being swamped because of the hockey game and all but its was just ridiculous. We were sat at a 4 top and there was only 2 of us. One of the chairs was in the walkway and another server continued to bump either the table or that one chair. Almost knocked our drinks off once. No apology or anything.   We ordered a few AMF's (which were really good) and two of their appetizer's: nachos were gross, the wings with Parmesan garlic sauce were even nastier. I ate the mozzarella sticks, but can you give them credit for that? Can you really screw up mozzarella sticks. Otherwise not impressed at all.   Our waiter continued to make inappropriate comments to me and my best friend. I don't know if he thought he was flirting or thought he would smooth us over because we were having such a un-pleasurable experience.   I was pretty disappointed with this place, everyone raves about it but I think my wing loving ass will stay with Native New Yorker if I want to grab some wings and appetizers."}
{"text":"We have gone to a few BWs in the area and they are all pretty much the same.  One of the reasons for the 2 star rating is that my husband is in a wheel chair. Once, when we went, there were 2 young girls behind the front desk and both of them stood there laughing and screwing around, totally ignoring my husband and me trying to open the door and get him and the wheelchair in. Another time, when we came with 4 other people, the hostess was totally clueless when she tried to sit us at a table waaaay across the room, through ALL the tables and chairs. There was no way I could maneuver the wheelchair through there!  Nothing like calling attention to a disabled person in a wheelchair by making his wife call out to you across the room that she couldn't get through. There happened to be a table right in the corner behind us. The hostess said she \"always forgets that table is there.\"  Um. Ok. The food and drinks were ok. Just ok. Wait was good considering they were crowded. I wouldn't say we'd NEVER go there again, but it's not at the top of our list."}
{"text":"We're regulars at BWW but this is the first time we've heard of their new \"Table Captain\" promotion.  A server introduces themselves and tells us they are there to enhance our BWW experience. They say they will let us sample up to two beer tastings each, taste different sauces, host our table if we decide to do the Blazing Challenge, etc. they were very polite, as usual, but once we tried the beers (Tasting was decent) and sauces (Couple of drops of sauces and some fries to dip in them), they never returned to ask if we liked it or how to improve it. Not impressed with the promotion but good to see them thinking outside the box."}
{"text":"I went to this chain restaurant for the first time. It is also my last time I sat there for 10 minutes never saw a waitress at all and I wasn't asked what I wanted to drink when I was seated. I don't know about their food but it wouldn't make up for being ignored. On my way out I apologized to the greeters for being an inconvenience and that I would walk to another place. Being handicapped it wasn't a good experience. After my meal at another location I'll walk back to the motel and forget that places like this are even out there."}
{"text":"Some service would be nice. Have been waiting for 15 minutes now, only brought drinks and waitress continues to help another table who has gotten their food and they came AFTER I arrived. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Since they updated the original bw-3 in Columbus, this is now the closest thing to an original b-dubs still left. In fact, the guys who started the company went to school in Kent and this is location #2.  If you remember the old bw-3 locations on every Big Ten campus before they sold out and became the Applebee's of the sports bar world, you'll enjoy the look in here. They still use big projector TVs but finally got rid of the '80s projectors that were the size of a car.  Aside from the nostalgic value, I don't come here very often. It's got the full corporate menu and cookie-cutter management. It's worth checking out as part of your restaurant history but that's about it."}
{"text":"After moving away from Las Vegas to an area of California with no Buffalo Wild Wings, I was happy to drive to the Eastern location as soon as we came back to town. I ordered 6 Hot BBQ, 6 spicy garlic and  6 of the new jalapeño wings that have a touch of heat but nothing substantial. The wings are cooked perfectly (not too much fat, skin or meat, with a little crisp skin, perfect). Got to watch a couple of hockey games and share some quality time with my kids (since it's loud, it's perfect for kids). We'll be back the next time we come to town."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the lunch specials were so affordable. Our server was a sweet heart and the fod was very good."}
{"text":"Terrible service by manager Ed Slisky. Rude person that does not know how to treat people. We will never be back due to him. So disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Health department needs to re-examine this restaurant!! The standards are definitely not where they should be. This is an embarrassment and disgrace to all Buffalo Wild Wings.   Please reconsider going to this location. The cleanliness of their dishes is repulsive. The quality of their food does not compare to any other location I've been too. Management does not how to operate this business or cater to their customers.  I have experienced feathers still attached to my chicken wings, expired ranch was served to me, human hair in my food, as well as, pieces of insects in a cup.  I do not recommend going to this establishment!"}
{"text":"We just absolutely love the wings! The kids love their flat bread pizza, and the tablets they offer the kids to play with while we eat in , YES you heard right! Tablets with games for kids! Woohoo Their cocktails are yummy, and the servers are great! Yes they used to be worse! But each time we're happy with the service(now a days) It's a typical bar, it's not fancy shmancy  But it gets the job done :) were fed! And we enjoyed it. And they offer a list of allergy alert sauces, for example I'm allergic to gluten and wheat, some people can't have soy, dairy etc. They have a list you can look at so you can chose your sauce 'wisely'  Ps. Try the wedges!!!"}
{"text":"Fried pickles were tried for the 1st time here. Service on patio was good.  The view to the play area/plash pad was great with kids. Annoying was the gate on patio the alarm was set off 3 times.  Other than that was a great AZ day!"}
{"text":"Dorian is prerry much the best at customers service ever. He works front desk at my hotel and is a server across the street at bww. He suggested bww to a few of us in the lobby asking about good late night places to eat and he was right . Him and Bww saved the day :)  Great food, amazing service , perfect order accuracy,  clean,  not too loud, and good atmosphere.  This Bww didn't feel like a chain with a robot waiter instead it was super friendly welcoming home town bar feeling .  Will be back"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time at bdubs on veterans day!  I didn't pay attention and went in before the special time, but the outstanding bartender offered me the complimentary meal without me asking for it.  Great service and delicious wings!"}
{"text":"I stopped by to watch Randy Couture embarrass James Toney  (UFC 118), which was shown for free. That's right, NO COVER! I foolishly got there an hour before the main event thinking I could easily get a table. The place was already packed. So, we waited for an hour and luckily got a table. I thought their wings were very good -- a little crispy, plenty of meat, and good flavor. I'll be back."}
{"text":"For the most part we have an excellent experience here.  Staff is on point and our server Angelina tonight was great ask for her if every stopping by this location."}
{"text":"Our server Sara was fantastic age was attentive on a busy wing night and she very polite if you stop in here ask for her. Guys was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Good was great and our server Courtney was awesome. Came in on a humble but was surprised at the space and the layout. We'll look to come back. Server kept my glad full and kept a smile even when getting some trying patrons."}
{"text":"This location has been hit or miss for us. The service has always been lacking. Last time we were here our server gave us wings with bones when we requested boneless and gave me the wrong side. Also, after waiting for our correct order of wings ( which were given 15 minutes after the other food arrived), they didn't comp them. I'm not a sucker for free things, but when the server clearly doesn't do their job right you should receive something in return. I couldn't tell if she was new/nervous or just didn't seem to care. We also had to ask numerous times for drink refills.   The food, when correct, had always been good. You can't go wrong with wings. They have a variety of sauces to choose from  my favorite is the spicy garlic. I also love the chicken wrap with the mango jalapeño sauce. It's spicy, but good!   On the bright side, I've ordered takeout a couple of times from here and had good experiences with it. Maybe that's the route we should go moving forward."}
{"text":"Pre ordered for 6:30 pm. When I arrived I waited 20 minutes before I said anything. 20 minutes later we had to ask for a manager. Apparently they forgot our order. Waited another 20 minutes for order but they made the wrong thing.... Finally 20 more minutes we got our correct order. On the bright side they upgrade order regular fries to a large....  Manager didn't seem to care, I guess they get enough volume of people that one bad service didn't matter to them."}
{"text":"I'm torn. Food: **** 1/2 Service: *  These were the juiciest, tastiest wings I've ever had.  But the service sucked. They seemed to be over staffed and also the MoD was rare to appear (and all the wait staff snapped to attention when he did show his face).  Coupled with the loud music and obnoxious birthday procedure, the eat-in experience left much to be desired.  We might come back... But probably for takeout."}
{"text":"I've had stronger drinks at Starbucks. When I'm paying 9.25 for a double jack and Coke I expect a little bite. My girlfriend was able to suck it down like it was water. Most definitely going back to the N 5th location. I even complained and it didn't even change. Poorly spent 130 bucks. See ya never. Too bad, I'm a great tipper."}
{"text":"I used to love Buffalo Wild Wings...however. The food has gone way down hill and the service at this location is horrific! It takes forever for a server to get to your table to begin with, if you are going to want extra water or any sort of extra service or to be checked on after you get your food, forget it. Every time I have been to this location my order has been wrong, but getting the attention of someone to let them know, and then getting them to agree to correct it is not worth the trouble.   If you really want Buffalo Wild Wings, I suggest sitting at the bar and ordering something simple, it's your best chance at getting the right food and someone checking on you throughout your meal."}
{"text":"Eh.... This place was ok. Super loud and made me want to keep using hand sanitizer.. Don't ask me why.... The food was run of the mill, not wowed. I would go back because a very fun and lively atmosphere that was fun, but I guess that is the focus of this place... Fun."}
{"text":"WORST WINGS EVER!! How can they be so disgusting?? I got sick after trying to eat two wings. And by try, I mean I took the skin off to allow all the grease to drain, yes DRAIN, from under the skin before taking a bite. They were slimy, oily, and un-flavorful even with spicy garlic sauce.  After pointing this out to the waitress, she informed us that they no longer had a grill...and everything is fried. Period. You have a restaurant.... your main food is chicken wings and you don't have a grill? Disgusting disgusting disgusting. After an hour my stomach was upset and I felt like I was going to heave. Not going back there, not sure what I was thinking since there is a brewery right next door.  :-/"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks on a Saturday night and the place was not extremely busy but for some reason it was like pulling teeth to have my beer filled.  Maybe the bartenders were having an off night but after 5 minutes of the bartenders walking by i had to flag them down for a cocktail.    We ordered 12 of the boneless wings that came out extremely quickly...maybe 2 quickly.  The chicken totaly dry, the sauce didn't even seem present.  Perhaps said chicken had been from a previous order or cooked before ordered.   If you're just looking for a place to watch a game and do not care about service, food, and drinks this would be a great choice as they did have many games on."}
{"text":"Ordered online as I expected it to be busy since they have half off wings on Tuesday.  Ready time was at 5:30 (45min after order was placed) daughter went to pick up the order, and it wasn't ready and didn't make a fuss due to the business at the restaurant.  So she ordered ranch, 10 min passed, still no ranch, then another 10 and still no ranch, finally they come out with the ranch.  As soon as my daughter comes home, I verified the order and we were missing 20 wings.  We call back to tell them and they said to come back.   And when she picked up the other 20 wings no apologies whatsoever.  Just the hassle of it all."}
{"text":"I havn't been able to find a place with tastier wings than this! The mango habenero wings are the best. Its really the sauce that makes them so if you order anything else from the menu that gives you a choice of wing sauce, get the mango habenero if you love spicy. Its sweet but very spicy (2nd to last in line for spiciness of the sauces) but the flavor is beyond amazing! Another flavor that is good is the asian zing if you are not that into spice. The hub loves the garlic parmesan wings. Kind of a different flavor and might not be for some people.  If you are not a wing lover, there are other items on their menu that are good choices. I love their buffalo chicken flatbread pizza as well as their buffalitos. For sides and appetizers, their buffalo chips, crispy southwest dippers, roasted garlic mushrooms with southwest ranch, and slammers with hamburger and pepperjack cheese and pretty legit. For wing lovers, remember that Tuesday is their cheap wing night and Thursday is cheap boneless wings. Also, while you are waiting on your food, make sure to request a trivia/ poker device so you can play games as you wait.  Lastly, if you are on a strict diet, do not go here. I don't think there is one healthy thing on their menu. Even their salad is loaded with cheese."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the number of families with children that were there for dinner.  Not what I would call a sports bar.  Considering the number of kids in the place, there was zero sports sounds and all kids crying and making noise.  No one was playing the trivia game, in fact it was not even mentioned by any staff members.    Service was subpar as the waitress seemed to be put off by having to answer questions.  Plus it was apparently a major inconvenience for her when we asked for some extra napkins (wet wing sauce, remember it's on your menu) and a plate (Hint, not everyone wants to eat out of a paper chicken wing tray).  Food was ok but nothing that would make me crave it or want to return, at least not to this particular location."}
{"text":"I had never been to a BWW before, so we decided to try this one since it was new and close.  Not a good experience - the music was so loud that we could barely hear ourselves talk.  The dining room was so crammed with tables, it was completely uncomfortable.  We ordered regular and boneless wings, and we told ten minutes later that they had run out of boneless wings.  The server had told us that the wing sauce was not spicy, yet we couldn't even eat it.  There was nothing good to say about this visit, and though it is right around the corner, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Usually sit at the bar, friendly bartenders. Great machines! Love the Wings!"}
{"text":"We frequent here during football season. It is a nice location just outside of the mall and it is right next to the movie theatre as well, which is nice. Their wings are delicious and they have so many flavors to choose from. They also have a good beer selection and this location has Hop Knot on tap! They have some pretty good food as well, just not too many low carb options. The service is hit or miss, some days it is great, others it is not. This past visit was great and she was very quick for us, we were in a bit of a hurry to catch a movie. It can be quite busy there during football season, so be sure to get there early if you want to get a table in view of the game you want to watch."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it two stars is because the wings are amazing. The serve is absolutely horrible. It took forever for them to even realize we were there. Then we order drinks, appetizers,  and dinner since we had plenty of time to think about it and he got the order completely wrong."}
{"text":"I entered hungry and left unsatisfied. The overall experience is satisfactory but BWW is not in my top 5 for wings.   The wings lacked proportions and creativity. My group of three ordered chips n salsa, French fries, and the triple order of wings. The wings were small and coated - not battered. The fries taste fast food like and the chips resembles tostitos.   Here's my review of each flavor we ordered.   Buffalo: favorite one of the night. Very crispy, lightly spiced and has a very buffalo style to it. Not to mention it's a dry style. Would recommend.   Garlic parmesan: too salty and the flavors are too muddled together.   Kicking? honey garlic: honey garlic that's spicy.   The dining area was good because it has many large TV to watch the game. However the dining area lacks privacy."}
{"text":"My background: Former waitress for 4+ years & Buffalonian so wings are kind of our thing.  As a former waitress - I understand one experience is not enough to judge on.  Everyone & place has a bad performance here and there.  Hence the reason I gave it 3/5 stars.    We were quite disappointed with this visit on a Monday at around 4-5pm.  Could it have been their off day/time of course.  If I go back I will update my review, but currently have no plans to go back.  When we walked in there were only 3 people at the bar.    Quick reference of problems: 1.) Wings were very dry - we asked for extra crispy but, they had almost no sauce on them (we are from Buffalo)   2.) Waitress was unfamiliar with drink prices (not priced in menu) so I found out my happy hour margarita was much more than expected. 3.) Waitress should have addressed the fact there were up-charges for things (I still would have ordered it but, would have been nice to know before hand if I was on a budget).  4.) It took a long time to get the food & came out warm not hot. (sadly I didn't time this officially but could estimate). 5.) It took 10min+ to get salsa & extra sauce for wings which we asked for as soon as food was delivered (she supposedly got sat all at once - this could back her up, from experience)      - however as soon as we got the sauce we asked to get our check to pay and leave.  When we walked inside there were about 5 tables in which 2 looked like they were over half way done with their food. Yet, right after we ordered I  went inside and there were no tables and 3 customers at the bar.  So the tables inside got their food way way faster than us.    Positive - She didn't charge us for salsa (but by the time i got it I didn't need it) & a few condiments due to wait.  Even though we didn't care about the charge we just were hungry and had places we needed to be but, she tried to explain and make it up to us."}
{"text":"The wings are well prepared and very tasty. The different varieties of sauces make it easy to taste different degrees of sauce and tastes. We ordered the large wings with four different sauces, to share. The wings were great, with the right amount of sauce. We also ordered a large onion rings, which were awesome. Cooked perfectly and hot and crisp.   The service provided was also excellent.   As we were there around 2:30 on a Friday afternoon, it was not overly crowded. As this is a sports bar, and not real busy, we really all enjoyed our meals.  If you want good wings with a large choice of sauces and bone in or out, check out this location."}
{"text":"The beer selection is seriously lacking, but I'm a total sucker for the environment at BWW. I love playing trivia and kicking strangers' butts while watching the Blackhawks and nomming on some spicy chicken. The service is usually pretty good, sometimes excellent. It's an easy place to go to, there is something for everyone here... except good beer."}
{"text":"They get one star for decent (not great) service and one star for the restaurant being clean. The wings were soggy and horrible, the appetizer of cheese curds was also horrible!  I only wish I would have looked it up on Yelp before my husband and I went to have lunch today!"}
{"text":"We went back and the service was so much better. But we did the fast break lunch with the timer for 15 minutes and if it wasn't out in 15 they guaranteed lunch was on them? Well our lunch came out in 22 mins and our lunch wasn't on them."}
{"text":"My friend & I came to this Buffalo Wild Wings last night for the first time and sat at a table multiple waitresses walked by us never asking us if we wanted something to eat or drink. The table next to ours was a table full of men. The waitress brought them multiple rounds and wings and never gave us a second look. We moved over to the bar and sat there for 20 minutes while the bartenders outright ignored us. My friend even waved over to a bartender and she ignored her. It was as if the waitresses/bartenders were biased to women. Worst customer service ever. Will never return."}
{"text":"My favorite BWW. Corporate owned, tons of TV's with every game you could want. Bartenders actually have a personality. Decent Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Got the blazin hot wings and they were uncomfortably hot. Even after washing my face and beard my girls vag literally caught on fire. I tried licking milk off her asshole but it wasn't as successful as I initially hoped. 5 stars. Would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Less than stellar BDubs in Champaign. On a Monday night with not much going on in sports we waited a few minutes to even be acknowledged at the Host stand for service. Others who entered later also had to wait for any acknowledgement.   Restaurant was dirty, many tables needed bussing. Server was inattentive, didn't refill waters, so we had to flag down a coworker. The wings were good, but subpar experience overall."}
{"text":"I've been to several BW3's over the years, and have always loved them. The only problem with them is that I've gotten too old for places that loud - that's more of a failing with me than with them.  I need to get a bottle of their mango habanero sauce, so I don't have to waste time with any chicken nonsense, and just drink that."}
{"text":"I am so disgruntled with this franchise! Wings are too expensive, we all know this. But there was a Rainbow with a Pot of Gold once a week on Tuesday's at B-Dubs. Buy one get one free traditional wings that had great flavors, but The Suits decided their profit margin was more important than their client base and have alienated any self respecting wing lover. The traditional wings deal has been replaced with boneless wings. Traditional wing lovers would not be caught dead with boneless wings on their plate and that's why you won't catch me in this place until they bring back their BOGO traditional wings."}
{"text":"This lost the great vibe of the state street location, and parking is expensive if you come by car. The chicken is smaller now, less fresh, and more expensive.  This branch usually doesn't carry UFC fights, and caters to students. Go to any other branch if possible."}
{"text":"Everytime i come here i leave with the same feeling, meh, I probably wont be back for a while. It is definitely bar food. There are good and bad things, its a sports bar chain, not a fancy restaurant.  GOOD: close to home, easy parking, nice servers, large menu, so many TV's to watch sports, friendly and fun feel, prices aren't horrible, etc MEH: food quality. Never left there thinking yum! I will probably go back, but its usually only when someone else suggests it or its for a sporting event and drinking. Not my favorite place but good for certain reasons."}
{"text":"From just take out experience I love this location! Ashley was so sweet & made sure my order was exactly how I liked it! Her customer service was amazing! Thanks Ashley for the good experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here tonight to watch the NCAA tournament. He showed up a little before me and when I meet up with him one of the first things I see on the TV are wrestling matches and NBA games. This is the first day of the NCAA games, with multiple games playing at one time, every TV, or at least the majority, should be on these games. We live in Arizona and the Arizona Wildcats tipped off tonight, the Main TV should be up and ready to play this game, after multiple attempts with all TVs shutting on and off they barley got the game on in time for the patrons to watch, after many boos from your BWW guest they got the game up right before tip off. We also ordered chips and queso and after 3 attempts had to send it back, the queso was cold each time, the waitress even stuck her finger in it to confirm. I'm giving this 2 stars because our waitress Alyssa has been trying to make the best out of a crappy restaurant and running around making her tables happy, which I appreciate. I would give her more stars but this experience just doesn't deserve it. A fun night out celebrating the NCAA tourney and Arizonas team in the big game has been ruined and it's very disappointing."}
{"text":"Not sure what we were thinking coming to this place. Should have known it wasn't going to be good when our server finally showed she said she didn't know we were there. The wings weren't bad but they weren't anything memorable either.  We were there on Wing Night so we had to pay extra for celery and blue cheese dressing. The Buffalo Chips were horrible.  Could have been good because the Pens were on, but this wasn't the case.  No need to ever go back."}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wild Wings but this location is a consistent let down. Find a different location. If this wasn't close to my house and I didn't love the spicy garlic wings and cheese curds I wouldn't eat here. I travel the country and frequent the chain and haven't found a location as disappointing. Management must be on a 2 month rotation. My wings were served cold. Chicken meat and chicken bones should not be lower than skin temperature(that's 98.6 degrees BWW Sardis Road employees...) Adding to the insult is staff that's too lazy to mop a bathroom floor but rather places a 'caution' sign. This is employee behavior that manifests from poor management. If this location was franchise owned versus corporate owned, my experience would likely change and likely so would my review."}
{"text":"I was incredibly discriminated against for being gay by the general manager at this location, william streicher.  My girlfriend and I arrived in overly flirtatious manner,  which to some straight homophobic people may appear as inebriated. As we were seated at the bar we were immediately told we could not be served alcohol.  I had not been served alcohol previous to the evening. The bartender was very nice and helpful in taking my order for wings but as far as the  management goes I am very offened and disgusted."}
{"text":"we went to buffalo wild wings last week and i didn't like it much. it was late 11pm, restaurant still crowded. music was too loud. The staff was ok (could do better...) we were 4, ordered cheeseburger, plate sampler, wings thai curry and buffalo they were so so salty i couldn't eat it, boneless chicken 3 of us got our order...my friend had to wait 15mns before her order showed up :( not sure i will go back there. service was average. please lower a tiny bit the music at 11pm!  came to eat after a long long day! the music once we finished dinner gave my a headache"}
{"text":"Food was great as usual (we're big Buffalo fans), but service was super slow. Not sure if they had cut all the servers too early or what, but this is not the first time that service has lacked at this location."}
{"text":"I had mango habanero wings. Omg hottest wings I've ever had in my life. I loved it! I wish they served Fat Tire Ale in Florida like they did at this Arizona location."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and was greeted right away by Joey. Then it was all downhill from there. It was like he was only trained how to get an initial drink order and that was it. Took 15 min to try and tag him down to try and order food. Once ordered our food was accurate and good but came out at different times which was weird considering we ordered all at the same time. Joey had no sense to apologize or try and make it right and was completely clueless. And after my boyfriend and I gambled easily around $70 we only had 1 out of our 4 beers comped. And I know that the policy is for every $20 is a comped drink but we didn't even get 2 comped. No problem paying or else we would have not ordered or for that reason gone out, but following correct policy and even standard service etiquette could go along way for Joey. I think his skinny jeans are constricting the common bartender foundation skills that could go along way for him."}
{"text":"Expensive.  Tiny wings.  Service is beyond poor.  Food takes way to long to come out (and 3 of 3 times it was wrong). I love the concept, the outdoor area, the massive amounts of tv's but they forgot about the good food and good service part of the whole concept.  Wonder what it will be next because they can't last long doing it like this."}
{"text":"Take-Out:   8  \"extreme breaded & fried\"  wings, french fries, burger.  All I had to eat all day ( no medicines...) An hr after eating-my legs & feet swelled up fast.  Researched the sauces hve sodium benzoate-preserv (never had that kind of reaction...).  I mainly eat clean/healthy. What is in the lard ?  Service was distracted."}
{"text":"Great food lousy service online ordering is broken can't pay for credit card over the phone"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but the only thing u should order are the wings and nothing more.  Thier nachos suck.   I mean really.  Its the easiest thing to make. It lacks good chips and the right amount of ingredients & the  hamburger are frozen Patti's with a wierd texture. 3 of us order them & didn't eat them. Pull pork needs help too.  So in a nut shell stick to wings."}
{"text":"Beer selection is awesome from dollar beers to whatever . The biggest upset is the boneless wings which are not as fresh as wing stop where they make it for you, however the serve time is upside for bwww, however they come pre breaded extra thick so really it's a small piece of chicken underneath all that breading. I did not try traditional . I had 3 tall blue moon and I felt great"}
{"text":"This is the second time I came this location and I've had issues. The first time I came it was actually my birthday and I was really in the mood for wings. They sat us down and took our order after about 20 minutes and we didn't get our food for another hour. They try to compensate us by taking a few bucks off but that didn't really matter because our service went to shit. The second time we visited they turned us away from the door because again they were understaffed and they said we would have to wait at least 30 minutes before being seated.  We decided to leave and will probably Never be back because of the service."}
{"text":"Updated 10/11/2017 I changed my original rating because this location has really gone downhill. For a good year or so, I loved going to this location and went there about 3-4 times per month. But the quality of the food and service has decreased significantly. The food is still decent but it can be inconsistent. Most of the time it's good but sometimes we'll get wings that are lukewarm, dry and tough - like they've been sitting for a while or possibly even reheated.  The quality of the service isn't great, either. It's not terrible and, most of the time, the servers are friendly. But, overall, they just don't run a tight ship there and the service can be slow and a little sloppy (for instance, we don't get extra napkins and bowl for the bones unless we ask).  I really hope they can turn things around at this location because I used to really enjoy going there. I still go but not nearly as often as I used to.  =========================================  It's pretty hard to go wrong with BW-3 and this location, in particular, is excellent. The food is consistently good and served in a reasonable amount of time. The service at this location is terrific. I go often enough that the servers know me so they get my drink  and appetizer order in before I even sit down. Great place to watch sports or just hang out with friends.  By the way, I've read some reviews complaining about bad service and long wait times for orders. They definitely had some issues early on but they've really turned it around. We get seated right away and the food is delivered quickly. If you had a bad experience you should give them another try."}
{"text":"TUESDAYS mean BOGO on boneless wings!  Talk about a great deal! The husband and I were really craving some wings and remembered that it was Tuesday so it was a must to have BWW for dinner.   Of course when we arrived the parking lot was FULL! Thankfully we found some seats in the bar area. Our bartender I believe her name was Denise, was so attentive and greeted us right away. We already knew what we wanted to placed our order quickly.   Seeing how packed the place was we thought our food was going to take a while, but we were wrong! Working 10-15 minutes out order of 48 wings was out! AWESOME!!!   We ordered Asian zing(my all tome favorite)- sweet but also spicy.  Hot BBQ  Lemon pepper  And salt and vinegar.   Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here, but the service was ok. I got the boneless chicken wings, and I really liked the sauce and seasoning I got (jalapeño and buffalo). They had the perfect amount of heat. The huckleberry limeade I got was really good and refreshing! Even though my sever didn't check up on me, she did bring me another huckleberry limeade without my having to ask."}
{"text":"I finally visited this location last night as its been years since I have been inside of a buffalo wild wings. The food was great, but our waiter Levi was awesome. He made sure that we not only had great drinks but that our food arrived in a timely manner so that we would not miss our movie. How cool is that.? Great food, great drinks, fabulous service. What more could a girl want?"}
{"text":"waitress brought water then never came back for our order. we asked another waiter then waited more. he was rude asking me to speak up louder. shameful carrot sticks.lackluster service. subpar chicken. won't be coming back to this location"}
{"text":"I love me some chicken wings, so thought I would suggest this place for a friend in town on business as a place to grab some wings. Had seen it a couple times when I lived in the Area and he was staying at Mandalay Bay.   Arrived on a Saturday afternoon, on a game day. Really packed in the bar and the main floor. I had been here once before and the bartenders were really slow-even for a beer, so decided to give this place another shot with my friend.   Took about 15 minutes to get seated, even with a few tables on the main floor obviously open. Some pretty cute sports attired girls working there, who I think might have taken longer than needed to seat us because all the staff is young and flirting back and forth and shooting the shit more than working. But that's cool, it's a relaxed  environment and they are easy on the eyes.   Waded through the sea of people and sat down. Waited about 15 mins between the water person and our actual server taking our order. Guess it's to be expected on game day-I'm not a big sports person, but I do enjoy watching people get riled up and yell and scream when sh*t hits the fan on the million flat screens they have on the walls.   I ordered the 48 or 50 piece wings for $34.95 with 4 different types of sauces and my friend had a standard burger.  Place was cracking and only took about 20. I chose the Teriyaki, Lemon Pepper, Thai Curry and my favorite Mango Habenero'.   All the chicken had the bones (I prefer it that way) and all probably cooked slightly longer than needed to be-but not a huge deal. The Lemon Pepper ones were under Seasoned, The Thai Curry hinted at that peanut type flavor, and the Teriyaki was just slathered in the sauce....The Mango Habenero were just right and I devoured them. It was a lot more food than I expected-I ate about 30 pieces before I had to undo a belt notch. lol   The beers were nice and ice cold and they have a decent selection, though I think our total time there was about 2 and a half hours, but the service in between items could've probably been sped up a little bit.  All in all, not the best, not the worst, but a great place to b.s. with a friend and catch up with the standard Sports Bar feel. I'll probably come back on one of the wing specialty nights with some friends. Like I said, some of the server girls were smokin hot with those black football lines under their eyes.   Hope you like my review! Cheers!  ~Mb"}
{"text":"The BWW chain, pretty standard throughout the US. No real difference. Tons of TV's, tons of space, service is relatively quick when empty, and giant tall glasses for all drinks.  Asian zing is my fav, chipotle bbq dry rub is my second fav, and they never disappoint. Honey garlic (available for a limited time)  was pretty good too. They are also giving samples of a garlic dip for french fries and that was pretty great too.  Happy hours have a good number of beers and appetizers on discount. My fav appetizer has got to be the mini corn dogs which were are an absolute must-have."}
{"text":"Been waiting for them to bring gaming back for a couple months now. Decided to give them a call before I take the 20 minute drive to see if they have gaming today and they did! I show up and as soon as I get In the door a manager approached me and says yeah our power has been out since 730 this morning and we're not live yet.....  Wow thanks to \"Heaven\" that answered the phone to tell me you had gaming back but no power right now.. I'll go waste my money at PTs, wont be coming back again always disappointed. Hope you dont need common sense to get up there."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for over a year now, but now question the quality of their food.   I mean, you can't go wrong with beer, but I was very disappointed when they stopped making jalapeno poppers.  We visited this location a few days ago and ordered the teriyaki wings and a Greek salad.  The wings were just okay, but the flavor seemed to have changed.  My Greek salad was absolutely inedible. I expected real chicken slices, but what I received was a soy product made to look like chicken.  I ate all the green leafy but threw out the \"chicken\".  I'm sorry BBWW, we will not be returning to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Not impressed!  Went to watch the steelers playoff game and while they have a lot of TVs they had the sound up so loud even during commercials which is really annoying.  The wings were not that good either.  They looked like they had been prepared by a kid.  The sauce was gooped on and those with rub looked like they just poured the rub spices right on them and much too much.  Lastly, when ordering draft beer our server didn't give us the option of a smaller size (pint versus 22oz).  I had to ask if I could get a smaller size.  A confirmation of the size at initial order would have been nice."}
{"text":"Bdubs, as it is affectionately called, is a decent choice if you feel like catching a game. I'm honestly surprised by the negative reviews from my fellow Yelpers.   Do you really expect 5 star service, or a gourmet burger? It's true that the quality and the size of the chicken isn't what you'd have at home, but Bdubs is bar food. It's actually above average bar food, and they have a good enough selection so that everyone can find something digestible. Their promos are decent (come on Tuesday for cheap traditional wings, or Thursday for cheap boneless wings), they have a long happy hour (2pm-7pm) and the bartenders I've encountered have all been really nice.   At the end of the day, If you feel like watching sports on big televisions, having a reasonably priced beer and maybe having a snack, BWW in Madison is always alright."}
{"text":"First and foremost I will say that when I've went to B-Dubs and sat down at the resturant I've had good service however anytime I've order take out it's been a nightmare. I've only done it twice. The first time they screwed up the order, gave us boneless wings instead of traditional had to wait another 30 min to get the right stuff. This last time was ridiculous, we CALLED at 6:47pm they told us 20-25 min. I got there at around 7:15 told them my name and the girl up front said she just had to get my order ready. In the mean time as I waited 2 people order food there and got there food first. At this point I get upset and tell the girl where's my food I've been waiting forever, she tells me one of my dozen wings wasn't ready yet!?! Somebody forgot to put the wings down. So basically I get home at 8:25pm to finally eat????? Ridiculous - that's was the last time will get take out there. Sorry B-Dubs...."}
{"text":"C'mon, you know there's that one restaurant that you only go to because you are part of a group that inexplicably wants to go - right?  Well, my friends, this is THAT place for me. I'm a little surprised I haven't written about this place sooner, but tonight, they were really... umm, off-point?  As soon as I walked through the doors, I could tell it was going to be bad. A server girl was singing (or something) totally off key and for no apparent reason than to want to drive away customers before even being seated.  We are seated, and the waiter couldn't answer definitively whether the tall glass of beer was larger than a pint, and didn't bother to find out. We placed a very, very simple order that consisted of only one fairly large order of boneless wings... and apparently they either don't know how to count or expected us not to notice but they shorted us several pieces.  The rest of my party were served their alcoholic beverages at once and finally, several minutes later, I receive my root beer... and on that topic, I was sucking ice because of how dreadfully long it took before getting a refill. Even once they asked, it would take an additional ten minutes or so for it to arrive.  The food itself was okay... bar food decent? I guess the taste was about what I'd expected, and that's not really a good thing since my expectations were pretty low.  Needless to say, they didn't get our bills right the first time...  We did receive an apology from our waiter at the end and honestly, he was pleasant and his demeanor was really the only good part about the whole experience.  Lesson learned? Dear Lord, I hope so! Though a member of our party suggested we make it a tradition to attend this place to celebrate why we went in the first place. Yeah... no thanks :)"}
{"text":"Service was great.  I just can not believe they built an entire chain of bar/restaurants around some horribly cooked generic foods.    First (and last time voluntarily) I will be here.  Somehow they were able to get liquid fake cheese into a deep-fried ball of dough and call it a cheese curd.  The brand labeled ketchup is literally watered down generic ketchup with a wild wings label on it.  No decor except four walls painted flat black and lined with televisions on them.. Using the TV's for lighting I think is so you don't see what the fake food is...     The beer was cold. That is the only reason I gave them one star.  And there is no lower rating..."}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly bad the last time I went.  Thay was about a year ago.   I go to try it again only to see they have a sign up stating LAW ABIDING gun owners are prohibited from their establishments.     I dont remember seeing this sign BEFORE illinois got concealed carry so I assume they dont have a problem with illegal guns owned by thugs and criminals coming in.  Dangerous environment mixed with overpriced lousy food will keep me away for good."}
{"text":"Parking is difficult and this place is hard to get to.  I don't blame Buffalo Wild Wings for the parking or the difficulty - it happens to be in a hard to access strip of restaurants and stores.  This place is typical of any of the others I have been to.  The bartender is laid back when I went but this was during lunch on a weekday.  There are tons of TVs and they will gladly put on whatever sports you want."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.  This was our second experience with totally incompetent wait staff, mixed up orders and looooong waits.  The first time we came during a dinner rush so we let it go, as our server seemed kind of new.  But we sat for over an hour waiting for our food while people were seated, ate, and left around us.   When we finally said something our food was delivered within a few minutes - cold.   Today we thought 'it's the middle of the afternoon, surely it will be fine'.  Nope.  Got seated and waited and waited.   Food came 25 minutes later, wrong order.   When we asked the waitress about it she said we had called the item by the 'tailgater' appetizer rather than the 'tablegater' appetizer, so she gave us the 'house appetizer' (???????).  We've been to other locations.  They're fine.  But, never going back again to this one."}
{"text":"Buffalo wild wangs is absolutely awesome!  the last time I ate at this place was during labor day weekend 2005 but the taste remains fresh in my mind.  I hear that they don't make the captain morgan sauce anymore but man, the wings here are just to die for.  Yes patrick, I wish they had this chain in the bay area too.  Let's write them a letter!"}
{"text":"So I was having a bad day and I decided to stop by my favorite spot which would be Buffalo Wild Wings of course! I got there and was attended by a host named Jocelyn, really nice by the way attended me, she made sure the table was clean and the food was bomb as hell as usual! Thanks for making my experience one of the Greatest of all time!"}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wild Wings, but the customer service on this location sucks!!"}
{"text":"Had to put one star because it won't let us place a review up. We have been here for 12 minutes and counting no one has come to get an order... I have seen 2 waitresses in our section but no one has stopped yet. I spoke to one lady who said she would send someone still has not come even called the phone got an answer still no one yet. I think smoke signals may be the next available form of communication but they may ignore this as well. The true problem is that there is no manager on the floor playing traffic cop to let servers know people have come in. If we aren't seen yet my kids may eat each other. I have seen bad service before but this is the worst ever! Please help!!! 26 minutes later a lady came to get our order but the interesting thing another table just sat down table 88 and their order was taken right away ... waitress' friends ... I think I may have to start taking food off other tables because I can't think our food will ever come. Laura came and saved the day good for her the other girls working this section if I ran the places would have been fired. Manager took a piece off the bill trying to do the right thing."}
{"text":"This location is the worst. Dirty, employees are rude, they just don't care. Watch out if you Grub hub from this location, your order is never right, and they won't credit you or even care to talk to you. When I use a food delivery service, I will always make sure it's not from this LV. Blvd location,. Discusting!"}
{"text":"We come here often since this is the nearest BWW we have.. The service is usually okay, there's nothing really to serious to complain about like tonight. Our service wasn't very great. When we first arrived, everything was awesome but it seemed like our server forgot about us. After waiting for about ten minutes, we asked for ranch.. Didn't get our ranch until 15 minutes later but by then we were already tired of waiting and pretty much done eating. Obviously every single one of our wings isn't going to be perfect and it's normal for them to have some dark spots, it's completely understandable... Tonight, there was one that was extremely dark all around and didn't look appealing in any way. I was afraid to eat it and just by looking at it you knew that it had to go straight in the trash! Don't recommend, only if you're desperate."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but now I cant even bear to eat their wings. I guess if i go here again, I'll order something else besides wings. I'm not sure what they did, but their wings have been stale, overcooked, and old lately. I'll pass. I dont know if its a new cook there, or they changed something up or what... I think I'll give other wing-places a shot."}
{"text":"Having been to many Buffalo wild wings, I tried this one. Not only did I feel uncomfortable going in there alone, the bartender whose name is Tabitha, decided to even more so make me feel like that by constantly looking at me and choosing not to wait on me; when a manager finally walked by me and then tried to get her to come over, she came over reluctantly. I'm sorry that I'm not some hot guy, and I was just a woman in there looking for lunch but she obviously did not want to wait on me. When I finally got in touch with the owner, he also could have cared less. I can see the profiling that Buffalo Wild Wings at this location is all about. They do do not want single women in there.  DISCRIMINATION at its finest!!!"}
{"text":"I have a great idea for you guys. When you offer specialty drinks that cost $12, at least put (1) shot in them!  Very disappointing. I would drink 4 or 5 cocktails, but the first one I ordered was all sour mix...terrible.   Food is always good though, just skip the bar I guess."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings, I'm pretty much your #1 advocate...and have been when I first discovered your location in Columbia Heights, MN in 1988!  I have definitely had my frustration over the years, however have consistently eaten 1-4x weekly at your locations SOMEWHERE in the country.   There are two things on my mind tonight, one that has frustrated me with this specific location and the other pertaining to the \"sauce campaign\" you have been doing for some time now...  This location has been turning out some pretty good food and service consistently, however - PLEASE resolve to have your wi-fi fixed! This has been in disrepair for at least a couple months that I'm aware, and is extremely frustrating.   On the \"sauce campaign\"...what a flop. Get rid of your entire marketing department and all of their consulting firms. Start from scratch, and get people making those decisions that know how to think! The way you have expedited is this...you only provide enough of the sauces to last maybe a week? Honestly, a week is generous. Typically less than a week...and if the sauce has been available beyond that, I've learned that it's because its awful and noone wants it.  What's really sad is...long after the sauce is gone each month, you continue to send marketing emails to announce the new flavors, continue to keep the flyer in the menu, and keep promoting it on your Social media channels.   Consider a campaign re-launch!"}
{"text":"Great environment for watching your favorite sport whether its basketball or the UFC. The food is always deep fried to perfection the way that every guy likes it. The drinks are cold and I never went empty. That's definitely important! My personal favorite flavor is garlic parmesan. Show up, eat up, and live it up while you can."}
{"text":"Seriously their management sucks! And the servers/waitress are soo rude! My waitress sad down with me to take my order ... What kind of shit is that & not only that they took 35 min to get me my food & let me reminder it was empty! Maybe 3 tables full if that .  Last time we came the waitress got upset at us for her messing up the order  Never again! Million times go to the one on cenntennial or the one by the galleria mall"}
{"text":"I love to come in and sit at the bar area. Jess is ALWAYS friendly and always has great drink suggestions for me to try. The food is always fresh and comes out pretty quick. I love all of the different combinations of wings,especially the honey bbq and spicy boneless wings."}
{"text":"Just updating my review:    I came here to enjoy their lunch specials, but ended up purchasing something that wasn't even on the menu anymore.  I noticed the menu had Fish N Chips, but no Fish Sandwich.  I asked my server if they still had the Fish Sandwich on the menu.  She said that it was taken off the menu, but they could still make me one if I was interested.  That's awesome!  It's not even on the menu anymore and I was still able to order it!    Why did I go to BWW for some fish?  Not a clue.  I didn't intend on ordering a Fish Sandwich.  Just felt like it last minute when I saw the Fish and Chips on the menu."}
{"text":"Love it!! Go once a week atleast! I know that's a problem but I'm addicted. BDubs rocks."}
{"text":"The place is supposed to be a place to go to watch the game but you get attitude when you ask to get the game put on a different TV. Plus it takes them a whole quarter to remember you asked. #neveragain"}
{"text":"Great food atmosphere and service. Check it out if you are in the area and sit in a booth. Extra special shout out to GM Evan!"}
{"text":"It's my 5th visits with my souls mates . Very professional excellent service by Michelle . She got charming face . We  was at booth 95 . She had greatest deal with customers . Wish not wait for next visit."}
{"text":"If I didn't love certain flavors that bdubs carries, I probably would never come here. I gave this place two stars because the service is really slow and they get your order wrong all the time. The wings are meh compared to other options in the area. I get that the waitresses/waiters have a ton of tables to serve but waiting over 35 mins to get my water refilled is ridiculous. Seriously, don't eat in and expect great service during a busy hour. Hell, don't expect any service if you are part of a party of greater than 8.   The interior of this bdubs is same as others, tons of tv's and dim lighting. Prices are inflated and wings are what they are."}
{"text":"Service is very slow. Not many people here and we haven't gotten our wings after an hour of sitting down."}
{"text":"At least twice a week I have to eat my spice wings .First time I came to this place on N Durango .Very poor service .The waiters pass around you and do not even talk with me .As always great food .But this time the most poor service I received.For sure this place I do not come back."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Buffalo Wild Wings!  I love that they have the challenge where your food is free if you eat 6 of their hottest wings in 12 minutes (Blazin').  My boyfriend tried their hottest wings (not the challenge) but said it wasn't as hot or as good as Atomic from Wingstop.  I'm in love with Lemon Peppered Wings and Buffalo Wild Wings didn't have it =(  However, they have a wide selection of other flavors ranging from sweet to hot.  I'm not a fan of sweet wings so I ordered 12 wings, half Spicy Garlic and half Medium.  I also tried my friend's parmesan garlic and enjoyed it as well.  Besides wings, I also wanted to try their nachos, onion rings, and sandwiches.  I was told that their onion rings are nothing out of the ordinary so I refrained.  I decided I'd try the nachos and sandwiches next time I visit, which probably won't be anytime soon because there aren't any near Sacramento or San Diego =(  They have special deals for lunch and good happy hour deals as well, although I don't remember exact times.  I love, love that they have the trivia game where you can play against your friends or other people dining at the same time!  It's so entertaining!  I also love that they're able to split the check so that each person's order is separated and includes tax so that each person knows exactly how much to pay!  3 stars for the wings, another star for everything else!"}
{"text":"Upped my rating since previous visits.  I have determined it is not to my liking to have a sit in meal service.  Instead I chose to order wings back to back Tuesdays (1/2 off wing deal!) ordering online and choosing carry out.  I have found the experience a good one.  I always get in a little early to pay before the time they are ready.  I had to wait a little longer on one occasion, but I did not mind knowing they were coming fresh.  Friendly service and I was even offered a soda each time at no cost while waiting.  Good wings.  The best celery!"}
{"text":"I've ordered online TWICE from this location and BOTH TIMES they charged my account for the food but by the time I got there I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO PICK UP THE FOOD."}
{"text":"This place is a joke.... The customer service is not good. We sit at the table order our food. No forks on the table after we order the food come out fast.   One order was a Philly cheese that was salty, the lemon pepper traditional wings wasn't seasoned. The waitress was rude by throwing out food on the table like it slip and slide with food. The French fries was cold so I sent them asked for some fresh hot fries, what I received was the same fries but darker, really don't reheat cold fries. Talked to the manager Chez about the service and we was leaving. He give us 2 free snack pak wing for our inconvenience.  Emily was a joke with a bad attitude maybe need a vacation."}
{"text":"Attendant was so great- definitely went above and beyond! I wasn't sure what I wanted and I've never had someone at a Taco Bell make recommendations ! For fast food I'd expect a normal experience but this was unexpectedly fantastic.    And of course crunchy gordita supreme (or 3 of them) - excellent as usual!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE Experience!!   Service So bad in fact that for the first time I've been motivated to open up a Yelp account to write a review. The reason it gets 2 Stars instead of 1 is for the TVs. For viewing a game great, but if you want food & service you can do far better. Beer selection is also very limited. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I was surprised at the low reviews.  I dined here with my wife and the wings were great, service was good and the restaurant was clean.  I am a fan of BW3 and will return."}
{"text":"The. Worst. Don't even waste your time. We walked in, sat at a table, no one. No one. Acknowledged us. 15 minutes later I asked for a manager. The young girl said they don't have a manager on today ( maybe hence the poor service) we walked out without being waited on. I contacted the manager via email, no response. Putting a bad name on this place. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Went for the first night of the sweet 16. Was a struggle to get the games put on any TVs.  Wings and fries were served at room temperature. Service was below average. Second time here, both experiences were poor."}
{"text":"of two visits, with a group of 8 veterans per visit, it's a 50/50 right now.   First visit in Jan 2018, one dude never got his order until most of us were finished.  12 Wings and a sauce.  You know I got my order - po boy and 12 wings right away, cuz I sit on the ends of the table!   So, the first visit was not impressive at all.    Second visit in Feb 2018, I made sure the veteran was the first to be served, as he was very reluctant to return.  But, same consistent food, nothing really to look forward to in my opinion - but consistent.   Wifi, military discount and app points available.    So, we'll see on the third and fourth visits if the review improves.    B'dub Bub!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting this location ever since they opened in West Mifflin and have nothing but a great experience every time I stop in.    The customer service has always been great!  The employees at this location go above and beyond.  Whether it's making sure that we have refills without asking or making sure our order is perfect.  The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable.  If you are looking for somewhere to watch the next big sporting event, this is the place to be!  There are TV's everywhere, so you will always have a great view no matter where you sit.  This location get's pretty busy, so I recommend that you arrive an hour or so before the game starts, just to get a table."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years. Never have had a problem until yesterday night when we ordered wings for pick up. All of our wings where fine but not my poor husband. Woke up this morning with a severe case of food poisoning.   Don't think we will take a chance and be back. :("}
{"text":"Thank god our server was a really nice girl that could put up with 8 hungry disgruntled guys that just lost a softball tournament.   The food sucked but we enjoyed the TV's and each other's company.   I didn't care much for the boneless hot wings. They were really nasty. The chips and salsa I ordered tasted like they just opened a bag of tostitos and a can of salsa and threw it together.   I don't think I'll ever go back to Buffalo Wild Wings. It's waaaaay over priced and the food sucks. Definitely a family restaurant trap! Only plus was the server and the TV's!"}
{"text":"I have started a ketogenic diet and was looking for a place to go out to eat. According to the ketogenic rededit forum this is a good place as they have some good offerings.   My wife refused to go which should have told Me all I needed to go but I went anyway.   I had 10 wings of the garlic Parma variety. The wings were cooked though, but I just felt they were not cooked like i like wings. They were a bit rubbery which means to me that they were not cooked long enough. I like them to just come off the bone easily. Also the skin was rubbery and kinda slimy. The sauce was great. I love the celery though. :)  Service was 5/5. Food was 2/5. Overall 3/5."}
{"text":"The service was not good at all, and it took forever to bring the food, they forgot to put the order in...."}
{"text":"I love BWW but this location was the worst one I've been to. My husband and I went this evening. We were sitting at our table for about 10-15 minutes before we had to call for the manager because we haven't been asked about drinks yet. It wasn't crowded at all. There were two waitresses talking and laughing the whole time! We ended up getting a drink and appetizer for free because of it."}
{"text":"I was sober-ish and it was midnight. And I needed a snack.  And my BWW-fan husband needed a snack even worse.  So we went there for a carry out.  It was weird, it was kind of empty.  I know it was late, but it was a Friday night!    The food wasn't anything special, but it hit the spot.  It is a BWW.  That's it.  Nothing special, nothing terrible."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout, the people at the takeout were confusing. Had to call twice because apparently the first time there was a connection issue of some sort. Food was an above average burger. Nothing special. Onion rings were delicious though and the sauce for it was just amazing! Dipped my burger in it and it made it a lot better! I got the screamin' nacho burger by the way. Fluffy bread, crunchy on the inside. Very messy though."}
{"text":"The server seemed like he was in a rush the entire time even though the place wasn't very packed. I hate the way you can't get multiple sauces (unlike native and wing stop) unless you order a massive amount. They even charge you for more ranch! We ordered nachos with our wings and they forgot to bring out the chicken. Rather than take it back and add it they just brought out a tray of chicken separately and he was to throw it on top covering up all the chips and having so sauce on the chicken. When we left the server had charged us for a Coors light we didn't have so we had to wait for the bill to be fixed. The place is over priced for wings which can be ordered anywhere. Beer selection sucks too if youre a craft beer drinker."}
{"text":"I HATE typing bad reviews on Yelp but I think my voice should be heard for my experience here. I came here on Father's Day with my parents and my visit here wasn't great. My dad ordered a beer and by the time he got his beer it was already flat and warm. My mom ordered a salad and some parts of the lettuce were brown. Our wait for our wings were more long than expected. I understand food takes a while to prepare but usually B-dubs doesn't take as long as it did today. The only good part about this visit was the wings. Not cool!   (I forgot to mention it wasn't that crowded and they weren't short staff)"}
{"text":"Such bad service! We were sat pretty quickly, and although our waitress was nice enough, it took her a good 15 minutes to even acknowledge us or get our drink orders. It then took another 15-20 to even bring our drinks out to us. I could literally see my drink sitting on the bar counter becoming more and more watered down. Our food came, and then it took another 30 minutes to get the bill. Are you kidding? It totally bummed me out cause I like bdubs, but I doubt I'll be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings haven't disappoint me ever. I always comeback here! Foods amazingly good and the pricing is reasonable. People are so nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Came here with some work friends, several waitresses walked by us and didn't greet us or seat us until I finally spoke up. Our waitress didn't crack a smile the entire time and wasn't very accommodating. It was a Friday night but still, at least fake it til you make it lady. Overall just bad service and the wings are mediocre, but that shouldn't be surprising."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location because it's the closest one to me, the service and food has always been okay-good, never horrible until recently. The past few months it seems like they hire 15 hosts and hostesses for a shift and 5 waiters/waitresses. Every time I come in, the place could be packed and people waiting for seats, but the host desk is overflowing with employees who just stand around and socialize. The general managers are a joke because they are usually included in this group of socializing people.  Today was the final nail in the coffin though. We ordered takeout because it's football Sunday at the cardinal stadium. I arrived 20 mins after our scheduled time and there was still a 5-10 minute wait (this didn't bother me- I knew they were busy and was understanding). However, the takeout counter was crowded with BWW employees who were all chatting, texting on their phones, or watching tv. I'm not sure if they were on break or waiting for a shift, but the customer take out counter seemed to not be the best place...especially on a busy football Sunday! So I was forced to stand on the other side of the counter, my back to tables and the main path for people to walk through, I was consistently getting bumped into and had to keep scooting over, pressing up to the counter, or apologizing for being in the way. One of the employees left, leaving an empty chair open. The nice woman working the register told me to take a seat and the food should be out shortly. A minute later, the employee that left came back and said \"OH WELL I GUESS I'LL JUST MOVE\" in the rudest tone possible without making eye contact with me. He moved down to the other end of the bar with his friends and I just stared at the woman behind the counter with my jaw dropped. She looked embarrassed and I asked her if I should move and she said \"no\" and walked away quickly. For the next few minutes I had to endure listening to the employee talk crap about ME. It took everything in me not to start a verbal argument with the kid on why I think paying customers should have the option to sit in the seats designated for them considering they are paying for takeout food. Instead I tried to find a manager or someone to talk to, but no one was around, just the hoard of hosts and hostesses. This was the most upsetting experience I've had at a restaurant and I was absolutely appalled by how that employee talked to me, a paying and loyal customer. I'm sorry to say that I will take my business elsewhere and be sure to share this story with many others."}
{"text":"Their food is similar to that of Applebee's or TGI Fridays. It's gimmicky and typical of the college bar & grill type of place.   The service was friendly which is a huge plus! But the food was just ok. Mostly frozen items deep fried and served with sauces. The wings were pretty good though. I had the bourbon honey mustard and it was pretty tasty.   Service from the bar was average but some people at my table complained that their cocktails were weaker than they should be so they ordered shots instead."}
{"text":"While I understand the input of various other reviews,  my assessment of BWW remains a positive point-of-view. That doesn't mean I override the negative aspects at all. I feel the same happens at times to me as it has to you.  I always get a table on the bar-side and ushered in directly. I'm surrounded by multi-tude of various sports on screens. There's on-screen gaming for lonesome individuals like me. I can sit all night without feeling pressure from staff or crowd.  I'm catered to by non-push-up-bra unpretentious friendly staff. Staff are young-ish cheerful making it more family-friendly. Job-opportunities are provided not based on looks alone. The same can't be said for 90%+ of sports-bars in Ontario.  Food & Beverages do take time to arrive, slightly under-value. Wings can be ordered in denominations of 5 rather than 10. Tuesdays 60 cent Wings night is as good value as others. That is if you don't mind not having your Carrot/Celery sticks. Not all sauces are created equal, stick with Mango Habanero.  There are nights the speakers sound-level are painfully deafening. Then some nights like tonight with the Leafs game on it was normal. I guess it could be hard to manage the volume with a large space.  In summary, it really depends on your needs and expectations. As for myself, I can stay there for hours with minimal F&B cost. Watching sports all night occasionally playing on-screen games. While not having hottie pretentious staff give me death-stares."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the shrimp tacos, and the Sampler Platter. I always try to eat at the bar because that is where you get the best service.  The barbenders give great service every time I go there. I don't drink but I love to eat and they are fine with it.  Buffalo Wild Wings better hope they never lose these ladies because the rest on the servers in the dining area are sub par."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Guy forgot our drinks, so he brought us someone else's.  Didn't come by once to check on table. Water glasses left empty all meal.   Food was good, but if you get Dan as your server - change sections"}
{"text":"I love BWW, I worked at BWW back in college. This one is a disgrace to the company. It needs new management ASAP!  From the walking in the door and no one greeting you, to the time you walked out and the hostess at the door didn't say have a good night come back or anything.  So many things wrong, from the way the servers talked about customers at the bar, to the servers sitting around on their cellphones, to the servers going behind the bar when the bartender went to the kitchen to get their drinks and then not discarding the ticket, to the servers touching all over the limes, lemons instead of using the prongs that were RIGHT there, to the food that took over 40 minutes to get out, to the manager who could only slowly clean cups at the bar, to the shift lead who was slowing down the bartender because she didn't know how to do or find anything behind the bar. It was a shit show is putting it nice.   Now don't get me wrong, there was one shining moment. Danielle, the bartender, was alone behind the bar and even though she had SO many tickets continually pouring out, no one getting the food for her at the pass, no one who knew what to do helping her. She kept a smile on her face and did the best to get everything out to us. The only shining light in this place is her.   My boyfriend doesn't love coming here because of price, size of wing, and actual quality but I love it. After today's experience it's going to be super hard to get him back out. Also mind you this was all taking place after 9pm so not even prime time fo dinner.   BWW you can do better, I know, I worked at one."}
{"text":"Ok, so yesterday was the first time my family and I came to BWW. I have to that I wasn't expecting much from all the poor reviews in here, here but have to say we had a good experience. The wings were good , service was great and the dessert was delish. The atmosphere is welcoming and we would absolutely return. Good for families."}
{"text":"I have an Asian zing addiction. I wish they bring back the Korean bbq flavor. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here. Staff is friendly and seem to have the same people there which is a nice thing. Service is quick even through rushes. This is my go too unless there is a game on, then it's avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I placed an order over the phone for pickup and they completely messed up my order. The girl on the phone even repeated everything right but when I went in to pickup, more than half my order was missing.  I then asked if I can reorder what I was missing but she said it would take 45mins-1hr.  They even mixed up all the sauces on my wings... Terrible experience. Will NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Go somewhere else. Foot was fine. But waited forever to be served and get food"}
{"text":"So we have been to this location many time and have never had such a BAD experience as we did the other night. We first had Amanda she was really good but then Courtney came over to our table and told us she was taking over. She then took our order and we asked why she was taking over and she told us that Amanda was not good and could not take all her tables so she was forced to take us. Really? Who talks bad about coworkers and then makes us feel uncomfortable and like an inconvenience. We sat there for a long while and the table behind us who had gotten there 20 mins after us got there food before us. When we finally realized Courtney had forgotten  to put our order in. No sorry or anything. We finally got our food who was not delivered by Courtney but Amanda who asked if we needed anything else. The food was really good. Courtney NEVER came back to the table till she brought our bill. Did not offer to go boxes as we were only half way through our dinner. I watched her play on her phone and when I waved her down she put her phone in her purse which had a colorful strap on it. I asked for a refill on my drink she huffed about it so I told her sorry I pulled you away from your phone and she tried telling me she was not on her phone and she doesn't even have it on her. I told her I could see you and you put it in your purse. She tried to tell me it was a camera bag she was playing with and brought it to our table to show us. It was clearly not the bag she put her phone in. This was black with a red  stripe down the handle not colorful like her purse was. So I give her zero stars but the food 4 stars and Amanda 5 stars. We tipped Amanda $10 for working so hard. Poor girl she was picked up all Courtneys slack and doing a fantastic job. We are both servers so we did tip her as well but only $8. I hope she improves soon or finds a job she's better at."}
{"text":"Ok, I know it's a restaurant chain, but I love their boneless wings. Thursday is boneless wing night, .60 a wing. For being a chain they make some banging boneless wings. My favorite sauce is Asian Zing and Honey BBQ, extra wet.  They also have real yummy cheesecake bites that are deep fried. Mhmmmmmm  Service at this location seems like it has improved greatly. Our waitress tonight was on point and real friendly. I drink a lot of water and quickly. Most of the time I am always waiting for refills, not tonight!  Hopefully next time I come here, the service is still rocking like tonight.   They always seat me next to the tvs playing a hockey game, when I request it. They never complain about it, which is nice.   Yay boneless wing :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We waited over an hour for our food. Watching other people come in after us & get their food first. & when we asked a waiter his response was \"idk, shouldn't be to much longer\" very generic without sympathy!"}
{"text":"The place is full of nice staff and some average food and is a classic to go to. It's local and pretty well priced. Obviously the wings can't compare with some other places but it's still up there. My youngest loves to go but understands that's it's not the healthiest food so he doesn't ask often."}
{"text":"I am very upset with this location. I placed an order online for pick up and set my pick up time for 12:20pm. I arrived at the location and paid for my order and I was told that it would only be 5 more minutes - which I thought was acceptable. 15 minutes go by and I'm a little frustrated at this point. I asked the hostess if she would be able to find out how much longer until my order is ready. She went into the kitchen and came out and let me know just a couple more minutes. I got my order at 12:46.... 26 minutes later and I receive my order that I should have gotten at 12:20. I am very upset with the service I received and I will definitely not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I usually avoid chain restaurants on the strip, but Buffalo Wild Wings on the Strip will get my patronage. Finding good wings on the Strip is actually harder than you think especially when your only options are hotel cafes and Blondie's.   I like that this place is open 24/7. My group and I came here at 2:30 am and we received very good service from our waitress. Our wings were juicy and finger-licking good. I only wish the celery/carrot side that accompanied my small order of wings didn't just consist of only two carrot and two celery sticks.   I will be back here Super Bowl weekend to watch the Big Game and eat some wings."}
{"text":"I love the Tuesday special for traditional chicken wings \"buy one get one\" favorite flavor- honey BBQ!"}
{"text":"Jordan is the best waiter ! He tended to us a group of 11 and did an excellent job with service! Awesome makes me want to always come back due got the service! Hands down the best service."}
{"text":"Quick update for one of my favorite BW3's locations in town.  The whole naked tenders menu option is a new one being I'm no longer a buffalo's regular.  I love the idea of naked tenders but for the money, I think el pollo loco is a better deal.  I know what everyone is think \"It's the sauce that makes bw3's bro\".  No bro...... the sauce is of no use if you haven't got any chicken after two bites.  The service is under par even at a slow bar and overall you expect a little more from such a popular chain.... whoops.... chain; guess I forgot about that."}
{"text":"This Buffalo's has a very neighborhood feel to it, however, it lacks the size and service qualities that have served me well at various Buffalo's in town.  The wings are always decent and the drinks are usually well put together.  This location is hit or miss depending on the time of day and the amount of people inside."}
{"text":"Awesome spot to watch UFC with no cover. Wings are amazing, service was great!!  We tried 4 different types of wings, they were all so good. Beware of the Blazin... Boy are they hot!!!  We go there for almost every fight but I never got around to posting a review..  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings beats the heck out of \"Other wing restaurants\" any day of the week. Their wings are insanely good. They have about a dozen different sauces ranging from mild to \"Blazin\".   I love their craft beer selection. That's actually my downfall there, I could try a different beer every visit. Carbo-load!  They show UFC with NO cover-- bonus points.   Last night, we decided to \"try something new\". We usually go for their mango habanero and hot wings. We went with their \"Asian Zing\" and \"Carribean Jerk\". The Asian wings were delicious. We asked for them well done, They came out in 18 minutes--a little long for a wing ticket time-- I've been in the restaurant business for years. Wings should only take 8 minutes, or 10 for well done. The Carribean Jerk, on the other hand were yucky. They tasted like clove and cinnamon. I'm not used to carribean flavors, so I'm not sure if that's an acceptable flavor but to me-- never again. Cinnamon belongs in dessert, not dinner.    We also ordered their triple play nachos, three different types of nachos in one huge heaping pile of fattening delicious-ness.   Prices: They have a killer happy hour. Beer is either $3. $4. or $5. and all of their apps are half off."}
{"text":"Great wings, and definitely have some unique flavors.  Total guilty pleasures.  You get seated quickly, and it's not bad service, but I think general, we did the bottomless boneless wings, and they took at least 20-30 minutes to get us the refills.  Similar type of service for drinks (less than the 30 minutes, but it's a wait).  I can't say that I care a lot about the service during the work week.  Great food.  Hopefully service is better, since we come to this location quite a bit for lunch."}
{"text":"B dub dubs! When seemingly no other sports bar is showing that boxing match, Buffalo Wild Wings saves the day. This location doesn't get as packed as the Tempe location and yet packs the same great attributes that each BWW has to offer: Above average wings, large draft beers, and TV's in every direction.   When you come in, you're greeted in the front \"hallway\" by friendly staff. To your immediate right is a large open area with lots of tables of varying sizes and booths surrounding. Continue onward and you'll hit the bar with more seating and access to the patio. There's one giant screen in the big front area that tends to be the main attraction, though you can get a great view nearly anywhere. Though there aren't any TVs in the bathroom, the audio is a lot clearer, allowing you to hear what you're missing.  Favorite food and drink picks: Honey BBQ traditional wings and Gamechanger beer (it's like a lighter IPA). Great combo!  My friends and I like to hunker down at a table Saturday to catch all the games. If there's a boxing match that evening, it's a huge bonus. There's also no cover, just encouraged eating and drinking. Even when we've overstayed our welcome, the waitresses have always been very nice and make us feel at home. Keep it up and I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I made the mistake going here on St Patrick's Day and the first day of the NCAA tourney - only 4 servers for an entire restaurant packed with patrons = two hour lunch that is normally 45 minutes max.   Chains suck, the food here sucks, it is the made and cooked and frozen somewhere else kind of chain and reheated or \"cooked\" in store and brought out to you with the greatest of ease, after a long long long wait. Chicken was flat and obviously fried elsewhere, the cheese was barely melted, not enough hot sauce but smothered in blue cheese that obviously is watered down. fries were over fried and too crunchy....the list goes on and on.   Beer - you might think would be good, well it is the 100% corporate approved at the home office somewhere mass breweries - no local support here....   Done with this place - about my fourth time here - really wanted to like it but it has left a bad taste in my mouth - probably from the hot sauce made in China or something like that.   The only reason it got two stars and not one is there are alot of TVs !    Later BWW!"}
{"text":"Asian Zing wings were the bomb!!!   New BBQ chicken sandwich with fries was great...."}
{"text":"Dinner with the family. The food was good. We had buffalo wings and burgers with fries. But the service needs help..... the waitress appeared to be tried and not motivated to be at work. She was very short with us and forgot half of our order but did not get the bill wrong."}
{"text":"The wings are, obviously, the attraction, but the wraps and salads stand up as above average bar fare. Nice bottle/draft beer selection. Overall, a good place to watch a game (or two) and relax."}
{"text":"I just came from L.A. at 3 pm and met up with some other friends from Cali I met when living here in Phoenix a years back. The boxing fight was on last night so we went here to eat some wings and watch the game. The place is new and it looks nice inside they female I think her name was Emily some cute blonde was very nice. We were like 15 in that table and took care of us even though we made it difficult her to charge what beers to who since we kept on changing places to sit lol. I will come back again for the great service and the water she brought me lol I was driving :)"}
{"text":"Been waiting here for 20mins for my food. Going to walk out in 5mins if I don't get my food. The server doesn't check back up to see if you need a refill"}
{"text":"Ordered a to go order online tonight. My item was fine. Husbands food they didn't even include any of the add ons requested for his fries which costs extra, he had the steak wrap, which was heavily salted, so he didn't enjoy his meal at all. Our breaded garlic mushrooms were so bland, not garlic flavored sat all, and very dry. Not sure if the food was made poorly because we did an online to go order and it was inconvenient for them or if it was the cook they had in tonight. Usually we have a positive experience with this location"}
{"text":"Love buffalo wild wings. The service is always great at this location, even when they're busy. The food is hot and fresh and gets to the table quickly. It's great that you can play games on the tablets for free with or against your family and friends; it makes for a fun time. They have a great selection of beer on tap. My favorite was the Mr Pineapple beer. It has a nice fruity aftertaste. Highly recommend teriyaki boneless wings and a side of wedges with chipotle bbq seasoning."}
{"text":"twas a freezing illinois afternoon, icy wind whipping at our faces as we ventured out to savoy on the 100s bus to watch a sappy chick flick and eat someplace wonderful (or so we hoped).  we were thrilled when the unknown restaurant we were hoping for at the end of our journey was buffalo wild wings, where we scarfed down a dozen mediocre chicken wings and an order of pulled pork sliders.  it was ok. nothing special.  what IS special about this place is the trivia game. as a frequenter of trivia nights at the local english pub back home in santa monica, ca, i was psyched to see a less exciting yet intriguing version of a trivia game.  they bring you controllers and you play against other customers in the restaurant.  the questions come up on the flat screens, you are ranked by score between rounds.  not quite as exciting as the team driven pub quiz back home, but an exciting way to keep my trivia brain sharp. happy times!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Ashley we had some great service and food! Thanks for the Cajun recommendation on the fries it was bomb!"}
{"text":"What happened  to this place?   Just had one of the worst dining experiences ever.   First of all,  the place wasn't that busy.   The beer was spoiled,  40 minute wait for food,  watched several tables seated after us get served before us,   half the food had obviously  been sitting under a warmer for too long and was barely edible,  weak follow up from  the waitress.   There was a lame effort to discount  the meal to make amends,  yet the bill had charges for drinks we had sent back because they were no good.   The waitress never owned her part in the experience   Even the manager complained about her kitchen staff and blamed the delay on us ordering traditional wings.  Isn't that their namesake?   Always had great experiences  in the past; can't imagine  going back to this location again."}
{"text":"This BWW always manages to screw up the order if you call it in to pick it up. Why Bdubs doesn't let you order online like their competition, I'll never know but it gets really old having to wait everytime you go in for them to fix the mistake and deal with poor customer service."}
{"text":"This place is alright.  Great place to watch football with the kids though =)"}
{"text":"Please someone explain to me why a person would EVER come in here. It is filthy. Just walking in the hall, my feet stuck to the floor. He loves cold beer, was a rough day at the office so I suggested this place. Arrived straight from work at 2015. Asked for a booth. Server was lovely. Food was not edible. How can they sell this awful food. The naked chix strips were terrible, I am not certain it was chicken. Beer was cold and good, but I am concerned about cleanliness.  Will never come here again and wonder where the health department is with this place."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday to try their wings. Flavours had a lot of potential. But their wings had too little meat on it. Server lost an order of my wings and assumed I already ate it. Apparently got sent to the wrong table. Didn't get an apology. But at the price point is good so can't complain too much. Would I eat here again, yeah for sure if I'm willing to sacrifice food and service for a decent bill on a Tuesday. Definitely don't think I would try them on a regular day though."}
{"text":"My wife and I are selling our house nearby, and we had a showing and an open house on Friday and Saturday, respectively.  So we needed a place to hang out for a while;  since we like BDubs and we like the trivia game, we spent our time at this location.  BDubs in general, and this place in particular, gets a bad rap, but they did an excellent job by us both days.  While not fine dining, the food was prepared to our expectations and to proper temps.  And the service was to the right level of attentiveness both times.  Friday night, in the dining area, our server was on top of our needs the entire time, and we were also seen to by the manager and offered samples of different beers they had on special.  All that, despite a crowded Friday night service.  Saturday afternoon, we spent several hours in the bar area, and our server, knowing that, adjusted to the appropriate level of service, without hovering or disappearing.   All in all, this location did better than others in its own chain, and more than held its own."}
{"text":"The host and the staff at the pickup counter are horribly inefficient and unhelpful!  When you preorder food and are promised a pick up time in 30 mins there is no reason that you should have to wait another 17 mins for your food so the guy behind the counter can \"get it ready.\" This is unacceptable and not how I have come to expect to be treated by Buffalo Wild Wings.  As a patron of many years I was shocked by this suboptimal and lazy service."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Buffalo Wild Wings and I was taken aback by two things:  the quality of the food and the business model.  Food Quality:  Three of the four of us ordered wings.  The bone in wings tasted like they had been prepared several hours ago, then sauced for the order.  The boneless were a bit better, but had so much \"stuff\" surrounding the chicken it was hard to eat.  It tasted like a processed product.  The mild sauce tasted like Frank's Red-Hot, and the Asian Chile was fairly good.  The cole-slaw was awful.  The cabbage mix was actually good, but it was drowning in a very peculiar, non cole-slaw like sauce.  My 16 year old son who has been to several BWWs said this food is indicative of what he has previously experienced.  The Business Model:  Low quality food with endless sauce options with a mid-range dining price served picnic style (paper boats) in a sports themed atmosphere.  Aiming at the 18-40 year old middle class male crowd is my guess.  The success of this franchise amazes me.  Summary:  No reason to ever go back....."}
{"text":"I've visited B-dubs all over the country.  I continue to come back for the draft beer selection and reliable food favorites.  My visit today wasn't associated with a game I wanted to watch, but rather an offer for Veterans Day, which I appreciated.  The overall environment was fine, nothing special.  Our service however, was a bit lackluster. We had to flag down the bartender to order food or drinks.  She didn't promote anything and barely spoke to us- just not the outgoing personality you expect from a bartender.  And to top it off, my Veterans Day meal wasn't even annotated on the bill."}
{"text":"As a hostess I understand the struggles of front of the house and back . I had Amy as a server she had a off day late to greet , didn't check up on table list goes on . I still tipped her good , thought she's having a bad day . End up having her my next visit 10 min to greet , my wings came with no ranch never checked up on my table but was busy talking non stop with the boys in a different booth I never got a refill never even noticing . I put my number on my receipt for my blazin reward points which was never added to my account . I must say most horrible service I ever had with Amy all other servers rock ! ether then that food is bomb ! awesome place !"}
{"text":"This is the worst location in Las Vegas every time we come here we forget how much Themis one sucks!!! Put in an order to be picked up on the app that said would be ready at 4:10 and we're still waiting, What The Fuck?!? Now it's making us late to another stop!!!"}
{"text":"Normally a fan of Buffalo Wild Wings.... But this place is terrible. From the service to the food, the worst Buffalo Wild Wings I've ever been too."}
{"text":"This was my first time in this location, and last. Be sure of that. The service when you are sitting at the bar is horrible. No matter how good wings and beer are done, they are nothing without good service. I couldn't get a drink here to save my life. Took forever between time I got a menu and the time they took my order.   They served my dinner along side my appetizer at the same time. They also run the glass washer right next to the customers. It has the most foul sewer odor ever. Just what you want when eating. Even the bartender agreed with me about how it smelled. Disgusting. Never again for me.   Had to edit:  I left out that I never got napkins, silverware, ketchup or salt. I ended up fending for myself off of a table nearby when I got tired of waiting."}
{"text":"It's a BDubz so it is what it is.  Wings are good, plenty of TVs for the game.  Pretty nice layout.  Only reason I am even writing a review is because the manager in this place understand customer service about as well as I understand Manadrin Chinese.  For the record, I don't speak Manadrin or any other Chinese.  Went here with a large group of people and ordered several hundred dollars worth of food and drinks.  Bill came out and I noticed a double charge for the shots we ordered.  If you have ever had a shot with Rumchata you know they mix 1/2 oz Rumchata with 1/2 oz \"other spirit\" say Fireball.  On every shot we ordered they charged us as if they were doubles.  I talked to the server and he said they don't have a way to charge those shots in their system.  So duh, charge me for one or the other but not both!    So I talked to the manager and that's where it gets comical.  This guy tried to tell me that the charges we correct and that's how they ring those in.  $10 for a shot.  I laughed at him.  Uhhhhhh it's not $10 in Manhattan let alone Willoughby.    Long story short he kept going back and forth and kept taking a couple of shots at a time off and we would go through the same tired debate again.  Mind you our overall bill was over $500 & this guy was nickel and diming me on something they overcharged me on.    Server was good, food was fine, drinks were fine, manager is an imbecile.  If I had a dollar for every time he said \"I will go out of business if I do that\", I would be loaded, but wouldn't spend another penny in that BDubz."}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because of my service tonight. I have been to this location several times, I always order online for pick up and every other time the order has been correct. Tonight was no different. I placed my order an put in to pick up the order at 7:00pm. I arrive at 7:05pm, signed the receipt, and waited. And waited. I finally left the restaurant at 7:17pm with my order of 10 WINGS! That was it, 10 whole wings took almost minutes longer to prepare than they thought it would. Once I finally received my order the guy that handed it to me gave a very half hearted \"Sorry about that man.\"  Now here's the kickers, I live about 4 minutes away from this location. I went directly home and opened my order and wings weren't even hot! They were warm. My guess is they had been set somewhere and forgotten.  So I'll probably go back, but that's just because this location is close by and convenient."}
{"text":"My son's favorite place for boneless wings.   A lot of different flavors to choose from!"}
{"text":"Three strikes. I'm out. I grew up going to Buffalo Wild Wings with my family. It was always pleasurable; amazing servers, service, well done food. Yeah. You won't find that here. I have been here 3 times since moving to Arizona, and each time it has gotten worse(somehow). The first time I went here, there were people soliciting services at our table to make donations to something not even worth mentioning. Twice we had our dinner interrupted by impatient rude kids asking for money. When we declined the first time, they came back. How can we enjoy our dinner when people are harassing us asking for handouts?  The second time our waitress was nowhere to be found. Forget refills, forget napkins. But that wasn't even the most shocking thing. Our waitress forgot to give us straws for our drinks...not a big deal at all. So I asked a waitress who was walking by if she could please give us a couple of straws(which I could see hanging out of her server apron), and she made a face and said \"you'll have to ask your server for that.\" FOR STRAWS? REALLY?  The third time? This was absolutely insane. It was Friday night 03/10/17, my girlfriend and I came in well OVER an hour before closing and it seemed they were already closing up shop. That's fine I get it, get to cleaning duties early on so you can have an easy close. But the experience was if they were closing in 5 minutes. Our server, didn't say his name, came up to the table and literally said \"hey whats up, what do you guys want\" in a dismissive tone. I looked at my girlfriend, then back at him and ordered drinks and he didn't ask if we were ready to order he was about to run off. Told him we were ready and he didn't say \"okay\" or anything he just pulled his pad out to write and looked at me.  We ordered extra crispy wings, and some fries, not a big deal.  Get this, he leaves and comes back in less than 3 minutes.  The chicken was soggy, some pieces were cold, some were warm. The fries were ACTUALLY cold like they had been sitting out all night. So when I reached for them before he walked off I said \"excuse me these fries are cold...\"  He grabs them and says \"oh Sh*t, sorry about that\". He comes back in another 2 minutes with the SAME basket of fries heated up??? How about some fresh fries? Not old fries that have been reheated several times? Let's not forget we didn't have napkins, plates, utensils(I grabbed these from the table behind me, and used one napkin all night). Never. NEVER again. Gilbert and Superstition will always have my business unless this place changes its management and well, everything."}
{"text":"I've gone here a couple times already. This is actually the only Buffalo Wild Wings I've ever been to so I don't have much to compare it to. Both times that I've gone, I ordered the Traditional Wing Combo with Honey BBQ sauce; Very savory, tangy, and sweet with a mild kick. The combo comes with your choice of sauce, coleslaw, and french fries. The fries are mediocre, kind of on the soggy side and the coleslaw is sub par. Now that I think of it, I should really just stick to the wings and not get the combo at all because the celery and dipping sauce is just enough. The service was pretty slow both times I've gone even though it was before noon, so I can't imagine how they deal with the later crowds of people (especially on Wing Tuesdays).   All in all, this is a decent place to eat if you're in the plaza and don't want to pay for expensive mall food. They have specials on different days and happy hour as well. They even have free wifi, which is always a plus.   Tips: -Wing Tuesdays = 45 cent wings -Boneless Thursdays = 60 cent boneless wings -Celery, carrots, ranch, and bleu cheese are not included on Wing Tuesdays and Boneless Thursdays -Free Wifi -Happy Hour 5-7pm (not completely sure)"}
{"text":"The food here is okay, but it's really the service that makes me a fan of this location. During our hour and a half business meeting, our drinks were always refilled when they were down to a third and both the waitress and manager kept checking on us to make sure we were doing well. We only ordered a couple drinks and an appetizer sampler, but the waitress was sure to tell us all her favorites on the menu and make a lot of suggestions before we ordered. Next time, I'll definitely come down for some happy hour specials. They seem to have a lot of good deals everyday, like lunch specials immediately followed by happy hour. The only thing I don't really like about this location is that the parking area is pretty cramped, but it's not a big deal since you have the entire shopping plaza parking lot."}
{"text":"Beer, Sports and wings! What's not to love! We'll let me tell you!  Service French Fries Cheeseburger"}
{"text":"I like that this restaurant is open 24/7. It's in a good location on the strip. They have a lunch \"special\" (I think it's Mon-Fri).  Rafael (mgr) was very nice.   Our server (can't remember his name) was AWESOME!!!   Potatoe wedges were yummy! I love the honey bbq boneless wings.   Beer was overpriced."}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos. There were extremely average for fish tacos. Which makes them slightly above average for a wings place's fish tacos. I would eat them again."}
{"text":"service is sub par. bartender didn't acknowledge my friend and i for 10 minutes a simple\"welcome i'll be with you shortly' goes a long way with customers. and than after taking our beer orders, she simply went back to her other tasks, i had to wave her down multiple times to get her attention to ask for food, seriously i'm at a wing place with a football game on and i have to ask for a menu? this sad to say is a typical experience at most of the franchises. the morale seems low. maybe they don't get paid well and that's why they have no sense of pride in their service or urgency? it used to be a fun place a few years ago, now every time i eat there i wonder why my group didn't select a different place. hopefully they get new management or a staff that cares in the future cause i used to love it there."}
{"text":"Horrible. I don't like anything. We came in to a busy restaurant. Crowded to where you couldn't even stand inside without feeling like you're suffocating. Then 20 minutes later we got our seat. The seat was still dirty even though the person just wiped it down. The table had food on it still. Then the menus were disgusting. I ordered a dr. Pepper as my drink & it came flat. I tasted the Caesar salad I had ordered & the Caesar smelled & tasted so sour & rotten. The waitress on the other hand was super nice, but you could tell she's only playing it off for the customer. I would've ordered dessert but I figured that would be a waste of money too! I would never come back here ever again. Btw, this has been written at the location."}
{"text":"Have you ever try mango habanero chicken wings? No? Good! You have to.. But when you do, just prepare for a great sensation (burning mode) on your tongue and spread out to your lips! Woooohhh! That great! If you survive this one, you got to try the ultimate deadly spicy chicken wings combo that they have. I'm sure you will be leaving here with a full stomach and hot lips! Love their chili fries and honey BBQ wings! Next time I'll try to conquer all the spicy wings..."}
{"text":"Do NOT stop go somewhere else. We though it was good the first 2 times - next visit food came out cold and after I took bites out of my food they re-fried my food AFTER I ate off of it! Health dept! Manager had them dump oil and apologized gave snack size coupons! Went today same thing cold food RUDE service from KHRISTINE and no care from Patty the manager.  Pass! Spend your money where you cam eat!"}
{"text":"Honestly the always overpriced and over rated wing place. The only thing good about this place really is the beer. Every time I meet up with an old coworker friend of mine here it is mainly to tear up the tap, not the wings. Trust me, If the wings come later it's an afterthought. The wings seem to get smaller every time I eat here. Service is just average. They really need to step things up here. Wingstop would be the way to go if you are craving Wings."}
{"text":"As much as I'd like to rave about  how much I love Wings from BWW. I would have to say that my co-workers and I order from here at least once a week. They have messed up our to go orders multiple times in the last month.   First time they forgot my wings completely. The whole order was missing.  More time missed off the clock running around during a work day. Had to drive back to get what we paid for  Second time they almost gave us one order for free but being the kind hearted honest hard working type we told them they had to charge us for one of the orders. This comes with after waiting for 20 minutes to get wings we ordered 30 minutes prior online for pickup. They stated that one of their cooks did not show up for work or called out.  Tonight was the last straw though. We ordered online again and I wanted dry rub on the side of my salt and vinegar order. I ordered garlic parm as they put that sauce on the side as well despite the clarification made in the ticket under the notes field on the website. Anyhow.... I also chose to get one Bleu cheese with my take out in which I did not get. All and all....  I am just tired of the complete lack of paying attention to small details. I am not sure how they have such a high ratings here but I am convinced and I will not eat here again just because of the amount of mistakes that happen over and over. I do not like paying for things and not receive them,"}
{"text":"I have to give it 4 on beer selection and screens for football. But every time I go there me and my wife fight. It has a weird vibe for a date. It's to dude I think and chicks somehow get squirrelly in there. I know I do ok. Lace is great for bee and wings with dudes though. Kinda like clear frat party ish"}
{"text":"In the past year, sadly, my husband and I have witnessed the closing of a few different BWW locations. Our favorite was just across the street from Fiesta mall and conveniently on my route home. I used to come to this location years ago when it first opened.   My hub and I are big BWW fans, so I took him to this one and he liked it. It's only a few minutes from our house. We're big chicken enthusiasts, so we hit it up once a month. When my in-laws come into town, we go with them. My 2yr old LOVES their mini corn-dogs and french fries. She likes to watch all the tvs too.   Let's talk service: Back when they first opened, service was spectacular. Barely any waiting, quick on the refills, and very friendly. Years later, the friendliness is still there, but that's about it. Sometimes we wait up to half an hour waiting for our wings. That's just too long for wings. Seriously! Also, wouldn't you think in a place that serves spicy wings, the refills would be continuous. Not so much. There have been a few times where I've stopped eating because I refuse to continue without my beverage to cool off with in between wings.   So-so service, loud restaurant, but REALLY good wings. We'll be back soon, always hoping for better service. :)"}
{"text":"We go to this location on a once-a-month basis. It's clean, fun, and the food is predictably good. There's always a good atmosphere. Having a two year old in this restaurant is definitely NOT a problem. The noise level from the tv's and sports fans drown out any temper tantrum my child's going to throw. I recommend the booths, which are practically sound proof, if you're not planning on watching a game and want to chat with your table. The only reason I'm not giving this location a five is the service. Most of the time, they are fantastic, but there's two problems. I rarely see the same waiter twice, which I think is weird, but also about every other time we've gone there the service has been a 5 out of 10. Things like drinks not getting filled, and considering we're eating hot wings, drinks are pretty crucial. Luckily, this past Wednesday we had a phenomenal server, her name was something like Erin. Can't quite remember. If you can get her as your server, it'll be a great experience."}
{"text":"Wings were just what the Doctor ordered. We ordered honey BBQ and buffalo, along with an order of carrots and celery. Try the mini corn dogs yum! Server was polite however drinks and check took quite a long time to receive and I go to B dubs all around the country and this location is far darker then all others, felt a little creepy. If you into that, this is your place, just not for me."}
{"text":"45 cent wings Can't really beat it Some of them where small Queso Fries YES yum yum Not on menu but ask for fries with queso the cheese on the nachos"}
{"text":"This was my second experience at Buffalo Wild Wings. I am not a raving fan, but the place is alright. If you are looking for beer and greasy food; this is the place. They have some great sauces for their wings.   They also sport plenty of TVs so you can catch your favorite sporting event."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience back home with buffalo wild wings but we decide to give it another shot. Nachos were good the wings were ok they were a little dry for my taste. so compare to my back home experience I will say this is a better spot. One thing is for sure Sunday football this place is crazy crowed."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go outside of our comfort zone and try a new restaurant on Mayo Blvd. I give one star for the awesome patio and one star for the different playoff games on the TV. That's about as good as it gets.  Maybe it's my fault for ordering something besides wings. But the burger was on the menu, so I guess it must be good, right? Wrong! I asked for a medium burger and it came out well done and very very salty. Now I'm a big boy and I do know how I want my burger cooked, MEDIUM. What is the restaurant worried about, people suing them for having the shits by eating a medium burger? Needless to say, I did not enjoy my meal.  My wife and I agree that we won't be returning since her chicken sandwich didn't measure up as well."}
{"text":"I was teetering between 2 and 3 stars until I looked at the Yelp definition that reads \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" I had the cheeseburger and wasn't too impressed. I also had the pretzel appetizer which was okay. Even though the service was good, I don't see my self running back to this place. $30 dollars before tip for two cheeseburgers, two sodas and a pretzel appetizer. The server just gave me the credit card receipt without the detail of items ordered and charged. The only saving grace was that this meal was charged to the company credit card."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with this place. We went for dinner on a weeknight. This is why I won't be going back: --Wings were served in fast food paper baskets. It's a sit-down place with waiter service, so why can't they use real dishes? --One server spilled ranch on our table and our cell phone. He stood and started until I asked for napkins. He brought some put didn't bother to clean any part of the mess himself. --We waited so long for a refill at one point that I just got up and went into the server station to get my own. --What kind of wing place doesn't offer you wet-naps or carrots/celery?! No thanks."}
{"text":"I found this place good if your into the sports wing and dine kind of place. I agree the service is not the fastest so if you want to come and eat quick... find another place. I found the wings really good. The staff are really nice and do know all the flavors well. I will be back forsure."}
{"text":"Had a great experience dining at this location! Pablo was a very entertaining server! Had our table laughing the entire time! I would definitely come back just to be served by him! Way to go Pablo on your customer service !"}
{"text":"The food was great and service was speedy, but I noticed that most of the workers were goofing around. By the time we left, there was a line up of people waiting to be seated, even though nearly the entire restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not rating them 5 stars is the service; their service is slow and crappy! The servers stand around chatting with each other instead of refilling drinks, fulfilling orders, and asking if we need anything. Ugh... if the food was not as good as it is, I would not be coming back.  Luckily, the food more than makes up for the crappy service. My boyfriend always gets wings, and I get tenders, and we share them. Their tenders are very crispy and juicy on the inside. They come in orders of 4 or 6 and they also come with your choice of sauce, fries, and ranch dressing, just how I like them. I usually get them with the honey bbq sauce, as the wings are usually coated in a spicier sauce.  Parmesan garlic is my favorite sauce by far for the wings; it tastes very Italian. Spicy garlic is my least favorite; it's too spicy and doesn't have any specific flavor otherwise. I've also tried asian xing (which is really good), Caribbean jerk (which made my nose runny from the heat), hot bbq (good), and mango habanero (delicious! but it made my eyes water"}
{"text":"Been her twice. Once for lunch once for diner. This is a new building and therefor new and clean looking. The space is very large with two rooms. One is the main dining room and the other is the bar area. Both are huge. Both have more TVs than I could possible count. The have many high-tops in the bar area and plenty of tables and booths in the dining space. The two areas sort of run into each other without a hard wall separating the two, just a lot of TVs and booths separate. What did I eat.... well Wings! The medium buffalo wings were pretty good, but I would like them fried a bit more and not rushed out with the skin still a little less than crisply cooked. The buffalo sauce was good albeit a bit too salty for my taste. Because of this issue (to me anyway)  they are not on the top of my wings list, but good enough to have more that once. On one occasion I tried the boneless wings. I don't think I like them as well. I tried them because of not liking the skin on my last order of regular wings. But the breading was too thick and way overcooked. They could be a lot better with less breading and not cooked into a hockey puck / biscuit like rock. I think they can make good boneless wings, it might just depend on who is in the kitchen. I'll definitely try them again. I must tell you if you like fries, they are excellent here. Had them twice with similar superb results. Hot, tasty and not greasy. Also the slaw is very good; crisp, clean crunchy slaw which goes very well with the fries and wings."}
{"text":"I was torn between \"meh\" and \"A-ok\" on this one but went with the 3 stars because the service was good.  Food was more on the \"meh\" side.    Ordered boneless wings, which I wasn't aware it also meant chicken-less wings - more breading than chicken in my opinion.  Although I have to say I love all the flavors they have to choose from for the sauce - they bring out all the sauces with little spoons so you can try the different flavors.   For dinner got the Parmesan Garlic Chicken flatbread - very much on the \"meh\" side.  It was kinda dry and bland.  Not something I would order again.    We might be back as they have a ton of tvs and seems like it would be a cool place to watch a game, but I will try the bone-in wings next time and something other than flatbread."}
{"text":"This location is usually always busy. Service depends on your waiter. I've had really good and semi good service never awful tho."}
{"text":"BDUBBS!!!   Love grabbing drink and wings here. My favorite sauce is the hot BBQ. I also like getting the boneless wings. I feel like I get more that way.   I like that they have mikes hard lemonade. I know, weak drink, but sometimes I just want something other than beer and hard liquor.   Once in a while i get the chipotle dry rub which is pretty good too. I've been meaning to tell my brother to do their blazing challenge. 12 of their hottest wings in 6 minutes, goodluck!!"}
{"text":"We have gone to this location two times now, This time our server was okay the food was okay.. We had a little spider in our plate which was kind of gross and scary since I had a 3 month old with me in his car seat.. Good thing we saw it and called the waitress..so she can get rid of it.. I would not be returning to this place again."}
{"text":"This is a terrible place to go to. I was excited when it first opened because of how close the location is, but every time we go, it's always an epic fail of an experience. The kitchen is seriously lacking. The first time we went, it took nearly 20 minutes for our appetizer (garlic mushrooms). When we got them they were cold. I asked for them to be remade & they did. We didn't get it until after we were almost done with our meal. The pace of meal is horribly slow, every time. Any time I order a substitution (ranch instead of bleu cheese, etc), it never gets made with it. The only decent thing about this location is the walls are covered with TVs to try to distract yourself from the terrible dining experience that's going on."}
{"text":"The wings were blah at best. A bit of sauce on the outside. The sauce was watery and soaked into the to-go container. Bite into the chicken and it's tasteless.  I dealt with two staff members. The hostess and one working the to-go. The hostess was welcoming. The to-go staff member seemed like she was irritated and didn't want to deal with me from the moment I stepped up to order. Even had the nerve to look me up and down like she had a problem.  Never going there again. The staff issue is a huge turnoff. However, I have no reason to pay a restaurant for less than mediocre food. At least make it up to mediocre."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome. A TV Is at every possible angle and that's always a huge plus. The only complaint about that is some of the smaller TV's have the local games on, while the bigger ones have the out of state games. But fear not, simply ask and they'll change the games on the big screens.  The food...Amazing! I recommend the Parmesan Garlic wings or the sweet BBQ wings. The wraps are delicious as well.   The main con however is the wait times. Me and my fiancée went on a Friday night , yet there wasn't too many people there. We ordered wings and clocked it at nearly a half hour just for them to get it to us. Nevertheless it was worth the wait.  All in all, we are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regular guests at this restaurant. We went to go eat there on Sunday night. We sat in the bar area. We were sitting there for about 15 minutes without being greeted by a server and had no menus. Finally, our server, Jey, came and introduced himself. He told us that he was \"expecting it to be a slow night and it wasn't so if he was inattentive it's because he's helping other tables.\" As a server, you know to never tell your tables this. We had to flag down other servers to refill our drinks and help us with what we needed. Jey was unable to help us as much as needed (& trust me, we're not needy people). My husband and I have been at this location, in the same area, when it's been way more busy and have received phenomenal service. Unfortunately, this time we got a server who tried to make his tables feel sorry for him that he actually has to do his job. My husband and I will be sure to never get this server, Jey, again. Train your servers to multitask, bww."}
{"text":"This is the best of chicken wings that I loved for many years. Their chicken wings are so good and delicious for me. l loved to have Traditional Wings at least for 2 weeks. Also my son liked to Boneless Wings. It was not taking too long to pick up since I ordered it , around 15-20 minutes. Very busy location, but the services are great. I loved to order on Tuesday for special discount and get more food for my kids."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. The atmosphere is great, the staff is responsive and friendly, and the sauces are great. The problem is the chicken. It's always dry and overcooked. Not matter how great the sauce is, it can't compensate for leathery chicken."}
{"text":"I can't say I'd bother going here again since there are much better options. My salad although good crisp lettuce had a processed chicken on top that wasn't good and the spicy chile dressing they splashed on, although I asked for dressing on the side, was too hot!  Made it inedible.  If your looking for cheap beer until 7:00 pm and fried foods, you may like this spot.  Definitely no shortage of TV's."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is good wings, but theyre the same everywhere and doesnt really make it unique like other wing places in the area (quaker steak, wings suds and spuds, Julianos)  I mean if your from out of town ya its good but there are definently some other places out there that you should go out and try  Anyways: Spicy Garlic, Honey BBQ are both AMAZING  i also like the buffalo chips with cheese :) yumm  And aparently (According to some girls in my class) they have some good fried pickles"}
{"text":"Just left after waiting here for over 50 minutes for a table. Then we watched as three other tables were served while we waited and waited and waited some more. Terrible service. When we addressed it with the hostess she just offered a pathetic, sorry."}
{"text":"I came in to watch a hockey game that was going into the third period. I was sat on the patio immediately. I was greated by my waitress Kora right away. I was given my beer very quickly. I ordered the street tacos. They were excellent.  The tacos were surprisingly good for a chicken wing place. Kora kept checking on me even though I was her only table on the patio.  Excellent food, beer, and service!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid place.  I miss the old \"BW3\" but they've got it figured out.  Party of 8, sat quickly.  Wings are their strength, and they tasted aweseome.  Salads well portioned, attentive servers.  Overall, quick and close to the movies.  Mid range on the price but all around ok."}
{"text":"My buddy called me to see if you wanted to meet at Buffalo Wild Wings for lunch because they had a 15-minute lunch guarantee. Being is that I was really really short on time I said it sounds good and I think I can make it. I bet him there in the place is about 25% occupied so I figured that it was going to go fast.  When you get there and you order they give you this little tablet thing that has a timer on it and you are supposed to time from the minute the waitress takes your order until your food gets delivered. If it doesn't get delivered within 15 minutes of ordering than the meal is supposed to be free. Now I don't go into places looking for a free meal but I won't say no.  Everything we ordered came off of there 15 minute lunch menu which generally was easy to prepare stuff. I had street tacos and fries and a Diet Pepsi. The other guys had the same thing.  At the 17-minute Mark the waitress who was also our bartender came out and apologized and said the kitchen is really really backed up I'm not sure why they were backed up because nobody was there. So you supposed to let the timer run until your food gets there and we did and the final Mark was 22 minutes 21 seconds.  The street tacos were wee tiny but we're actually pretty decent. Little heavy on the sauce. The fries were nothing remarkable or special. However I do have to say that my buddies got boneless wings and they were Thai spicy. I really enjoy spicy food but I grabbed one thinking it wasn't going to be spicy at all. How about 13 seconds later my face started to melt and I had to chug about 8 gallons of Diet Pepsi I don't know what was in it but it was delicious and I'm going to do that again.  Overall I don't like going there except when I can have beer with my food I'm not sure I would go there again for lunch but getting a free lunch was actually kind of neat. I did feel bad for the server cuz it wasn't her fault but we made sure to tip her anyway."}
{"text":"pretty good, we tried a couple flavors but the parmesean garlic and honey bbq are my favorite.   will go again since the house is nearby anyways =)"}
{"text":"I've noticed the quality of wings have gone down-hill over the years with the chain in general.  They have added additional flavors and styles (such as the dry rub) but I always go with either traditional or boneless mild/BBQ.  The main thing I notice isn't as good is how the wings are sauced.  Sometimes all in the same order one wing will be loaded and another one almost dry.  Service is always really good here though, servers refill drinks quickly and there are TV's everywhere you go to watch the game.  Lunch specials are available and they even have a frequent lunch card.  i might try other wing places, but I'll seldom turn-down an invite to \"B-Dubs\""}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I placed a to go order. They tell you a certain time to pick it up and you can't make it earlier than the preset time. I got there at exactly the time they told me, picked up my food and drove home(which is about 5 minutes away) and nothing was even kinda warm. I ordered 2 cheese sampler plates and 3 small wing baskets. It wasnt a big order so I dont see why it would be cold. Now, on the other hand, I am a guy that savors the flavor. The flavor on everything was great. It might have been cold but I could still taste the excellent flavor. Dining in the restaraunt would probably change my rating but as it stands it could be better. There shouldnt be a preset time if the food is going to get done earlier and then just sit there."}
{"text":"I've been a steady customer of BWW for many years. Came to this particular location during my lunch hour recently. The service was slow even though the place had no more than 10 patrons. Furthermore, when my buffalo ranch chicken wrap finally came, the tortilla was still half frozen in the middle. With so many other competitors in the area, why would I consider coming back?"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 4 on Sunday and arrived right before the Browns game was getting ready to start.   We were told it would be about 45 minutes to sit down, but there were only about 3 groups of people waiting and there were empty tables seemingly everywhere.  Decided to wait and ended up getting seated in about 5.  That was about the end of the positives today.  Beers were cold enough, but for the most part were coming to us poured pretty short.  One of our orders was incorrect (got traditional instead of boneless) and another ended up being rang out incorrectly.  The server was definitely doing his best and some of these things probably were not his fault.  However, some of the wings came out cold (after waiting close to an hour for food) and had to be sent back.  The replacements were out very quickly.  The restaurant itself was surprisingly nice.  Very modern, lots of room, and a ton of TVs.  So with all that being said, why only two stars?  Well, simply put, something was definitely off with the wings I ate.  I've been living in my bathroom at home for the past 12 hours or so.  Luckily technology and all of this free time has graced me with the ability to write my review.  Not sure I will be back.  Food poisoning is a deal breaker for me.  I think any restaurant that goes into this location is cursed.  Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"Worst wings i have had in a while.   There beer selection is just you normal boring corporate Bud, Coord ect.   Pretty disappointing have bad wings at a place called Wild Wings.  The ranch they use is terrible, taste like crapy store bought bottled ranch."}
{"text":"Best BWW in town.  They always throw an extra wing in there and awesome staff!"}
{"text":"I love the Thai curry wings. Service is always mediocre and I feel like it's overpriced. The kids love the tablets..."}
{"text":"Ordered online some wings and fries, order said it would be ready at 8 I went in at 8:04 the lady told me \"your order will be ready in 10 minuets\" I waited and it wasn't 10 min it was 20 they had me wait, I got my food at 8:21 when it should have been ready at 8. I was annoyed. When I got home notice the frys were not fresh and the wings were alright not as fresh."}
{"text":"Yikes. An atrocious sports bar with 3,000 flat panel TVs, and a laminated menu book.   I've been back a couple of times since my first bad review and think they have improved things a bit. Bone-in wings have flavor, though stay away from most of the sauces. The drier the better, here.  I've had a burger which was decent - better than the Red Robin across the parking lot. Fried pickles are welcome. And a good selection of beers.   Sports bars are a thing, I get it. Some people like this kind of stuff. (I'd rather cook at home). But you can do worse in this town. A lot worse. Somewhere between 2 and 3 stars."}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good. They are like a slightly better quality Quaker Steak. The only real complaint I can think of is that they always seem to be super busy."}
{"text":"Any place I can order wings and fried pickles at 4:00 in the morning from the app in my phone is a winner."}
{"text":"We made a huge mistake by sitting at the bar tonight. We got a close up view of the drink preparation and food servers...we were completely turned off watching the drinks made/delivered. Multiple girls touched/fixed their hair, and then grabbed lemons with the same BARE hands that they just touched their hair & threw them straight into the customers drinks: GROSS! The guy behind the bar was eating and drinking while mixing drinks. I do not recommend the spicy garlic wings. Not only were they cold, but the flavor was unappealing. I told the servers I didn't like them but no offer was made to fix the issue. Very unhappy with our visit tonight."}
{"text":"We normally come here every few weeks. But tonight was horrible. Came in at 7:30 and just finished our meal after it took almost an hour to arrive (it's 9:18). Service all around was slow. Should have gone to Matthews."}
{"text":"I really like this bw3. They have a ton of TVs if you are into sports and good chicken if you are into that. Check it out."}
{"text":"These are my favorite wings but service usually sucks here.  That is the main thing, the service, if they could fix this I would give 5 stars. The only reason I am giving 3 stars if because the food is spot on, it's clean, and the waiter I've had the last 2 times I was there was great, his name is Tristan. So if you go, ask for him and you should have a great experience:)"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here on game day!  The kids love to play trivia.  We love the Chili Con Queso Dip.  I order the same thing each time... The Chicken Tender Salad with Honey BBQ and Ranch.  It has fresh crisp lettuce, red onions, tomatoes, seasoned croutons, and their delicious chicken tenders tossed in any sauce you desire, plus dressing.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Fun place for wings and drinks.  Lots of great sauces.  This place will do a sauce tasting for you, which is pretty awesome.  My favorite sauces/dry rubs: Desert Heat (also good on fries/buffalo chips) Mango Habenero Honey BBQ Hot"}
{"text":"I recently bought a great coupon book, that has discounts for everything imaginable in my area. I figured, since we're new to this part of the Valley, I'd buy it (not to mention the $$ goes towards a great cause).  Went to BWW's, after driving past it a couple of times....should've done exactly that, keep on driving.   We decided to use our buy 1 sampler, get one free... Sat at the bar, with some old horny drunk next to me, trying to hit on all the girls. We ordered the BBQ sandwich sliders and a sampler platter (onion rings, boneless wings, nachos, mozzarella sticks w/3 dipping sauces). Hubby ordered some beer and I drank a \"berry\" lemonade.   Got our drinks which BTW, were not that good...beer wasn't as \"hoppy\" as my husband would've liked it to be, he asked the bartender which was a better choice and she was useless. My lemonade tasted like crap...my next order was water.  Food got to us, but we had no utensils or napkins, had to ask for those. Onion rings were really good, mozz sticks were ok as well... wings...isn't this what this place is known for... they were mediocre. Tried the sliders...I've had better pulled pork (like the one I make or Famous Dave's).   Once we were done eating, I had to ask for my bill abt 3x's. Thankfully we had that coupon, because if it was up to me, I wouldn't have paid squat!   I was contemplating giving the rest of the coupons that I had for this place, to the guys next to me...we won't be needing them."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings disappointed me once again this is the second time I order hot medium boneless and the amount of sauce they used was ridiculous they might as well not put any !!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time to buffalo wild wings. Not a wing fan at all but my son wanted to eat here for his birthday. Honestly I don't get all the negative comments on yelp. Our server was very nice and attentive, the manager Dave very funny and nice. They made my son happy which makes me happy. I am also very thankful they sold more than wings lol"}
{"text":"Best bartender ever. MC was great. Anticipated my needs when I ate the 'Blazin' wings. I was in a visible amount of pain, and she squirted breast milk straight into my mouth (from across the bar, I might add.) She saved my tastebuds, and for that, I'm thankful.   Wings were killer spicy. I'd recommend challenging your mouth. I did."}
{"text":"Food was average but Johnny the bartender worked hard to plz me Half price appetizers was nice b4 7 too. Loud crowd 4 game. Was fun.. place now closed!"}
{"text":"Ordered and paid for food online. They couldn't pull it in their system even though I showed confirmation on my phone. Reordered and was told 10-15 wait, I waited 45 minutes and just canceled my order. TERRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"I dislike BWW in general, and was hoping for a better experience. But alas, I was unlucky.   This place is good for groups, I'll give them that. But overall the environment is loud and headache inducing.   The food is basic and uninspired. My buffalo Mac and cheese came out looking unappetizing, no garnish, just a plate of beige and the chicken was oddly placed. The salt and vinegar fries were delivered cold, and the boneless wings were mushy.  The service was average, and it bothers me how they give new cups of water and don't clear empty cups or, give a pitcher for the table.   I hate being outvoted, especially when the result is BWW."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The restaurant is very clean and everyone is super friendly. Our absolute favorite bartender is Miss Erica.  Such an amazing personality and great customer service. We will continue to come back every Thursday just to see her!"}
{"text":"By reading the category alone, you already know a bit about this place.  It's a sports bar, which means public displays of testosterone are visible on screens in every direction.  If sports aren't your bag, there's video trivia.  If neither of those get your juices bubbling... well, what the-fuck are you doing here anyway?    The menu isn't surprising: wings, burgers, and deep fried stuff.   It's a bar.  Stick to the wings, as that this place's namesake.  Are they the world's best?  God no.  But they're genuinely good, and the sauce selection spreads wider than a double-jointed gymnast.  A variety of tastes, a range of spiciness, but pay attention to the guide on the menu for the heat factor.  My lips accidentally went ablaze with the Caribbean jerk, which is nothing like jerk sauce in the actual Caribbean, but I digress.  The service is always a low point, and there's a weird-assed heirarchy regarding time.  If you work second-shift, don't expect to see a waitress after work.   Until 10:00 pm or so, tables are waited on -- albeit poorly.  Our waitress disappeared for an hour.   (And beware, they card everyone who's not dead of old age.)   After 10:00 pm, they have a fast food-looking counter, or if you want a beer you have to go to the bar.... which is a kind of shitty transition to make late in your stay if you start with a waiter.  After 11:00pm, everything's goes through the bar, and at midnight the kitchen closes.  The bartender was on top of things.   What can you say, it's a chain, it's everywhere, and it's a pretty unoriginal concept.  But it's dependable for what it is, and the wings are usually good."}
{"text":"I should give it 0..but Im a nice person.   On a to-go order, they forgot the fried pickles, burnt the mini corndogs, 6 small mushrooms in an order of fried mushrooms...and when we called for a refund they said it would take 5-7 days to refund something they had just charged us for 15 minutes earlier.  Called in and was put on hold twice for several minutes.  The manager never bothered to pick up the phone. This place is going downhill."}
{"text":"We love going to buffalo wild wings. The service and food are always great at this location. Unfortunately they changed the mac and cheese, and my kids hate it. I tasted it, and it's awful. We also loved the jammin jalapeño sauce, which has also been discontinued.  Otherwise this is a great place for wings, just bring back the old mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times.  This place is ok.  Service was good.  I had the chili cheese fries.  They were so bad.  I also had a whiskey and coke.  I can't really say much good or much bad about this place.  It was really really cold inside, though."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on Saturday.  Our waitress was friendly, and the food came out hot and fresh.  We both got wings (salt and vineger, honey bbq), and split a basket of fries.  Due to the heat, everyone was crammed inside, but overall it didn't much detract from the experience.  Drink refills were prompt and didn't require asking.  One of our better BWW experiences lately!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Took 30 mins to even be greeted by our waiter and didn't even apologize for being so slow. Could not multi task to save his life!!!!!"}
{"text":"Captains are worthless.  They never provide a service. I come here regularly. 3-4 times a month.   Tonight is Monday night football and the Captain has been standing watching the game and socializing with HIS friends.  Have them run food, refill drinks, something.  By far the slowest and most poorly run BWW.  I like the food and the atmosphere but the service needs to upgraded.  I really don't expect much, but more often than not service is poor."}
{"text":"I normally really like BWW. Just not this location. I've been here a few times and the service is crap. Once, on the patio, our waiter forgot about us for AN HOUR. We looked around for him inside and it was like he was away on his lunch break. It was late at night, but on a hopping Saturday... unacceptable.   The food here is also below my normal BWW standards. Maybe they are changing their recipe, but here the boneless wings are 40% meat 60% breading. Ugh."}
{"text":"All there food there is frozen, nothing's fresh! The one thing that should be frozen wasn't the  mozzarella sticks were defrosted too soon and all the cheese ran out of it, all I tasted was breading....do yourself a favor and find a better wing spot or just order drinks I don't know how u can mess up cheese and spinach dip but they managed to do it. Ew"}
{"text":"Stay away from this BWW...... Worst experience I have ever received at any BWW. My husband and I always visit the one located in Westgate, but living closer to the one on McDowell, we decided to give it a try...BIG MISTAKE! We should of walked out the first moment that we arrived as the girl in the front simply said \"oh go ahead and go to the bar area.\" Didn't bother to at least give us a menu. After we sat ourselves down we waited for about 10 minutes for our server to finally come by and acknowledge us. It was around 11:00 pm and it wasn't busy at all so I assumed the wait would be minimal. The waitress finally took our drink order and said she would be back in a few to take our food order. After another 10 minutes she finally took our order. She came back with the food and no ranch, she made it very clear that it would be a .60 cent/per ranch and would not bring some unless wee were ok with the pitied. We said ok, and another 5 minutes passed before we could get our ranch. At this time she finally brought my husband his SODA.   Not only was the service horrible but the food was disgusting. My onion rings were hard and needless to the say the wings were dry and some didn't even have sauce. I should have called a manager but I honestly didn't have the energy. Never going back here again and taking my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Watched the football playoffs here.  Great wings and wraps.  Lots of draft beers.  Natasha did a great job )better than that) and Andrew was a terrific restaurant captain.   If you are on strip and need wings or sports bar - this is the place"}
{"text":"Went to this BWW to watch a couple of playoff games, I wanted to watch a specific game and our server was nice enough to quickly change the channel of the closest TV.  Now let's get into why I will not be returning to this place, THE FOOD. We started with a chilli con queso dip which literally tasted like they put a bunch of Tostitos chips with a bowl of cheese and chilli that just came out of the microwave, YUK not fresh at all. Next we ordered some wings, which came out cold. BLEH.   I was also seating in the outside area which looked unorganized, the wrong food was being delivered to the wrong tables throughout the entire night. The only reason why I am giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because our sever \"Alexia\" was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I work and live within about 5 minutes of this location. I have been a B-Dubs loyal customer for over a decade (and that's serious since I'm originally from Buffalo!) This location is GOD AWFUL. I have had constant problems with their phone systems for calling in orders, their staff for rudeness or just lack of service, and even their food. The last order I had tasted like it had sat for about 2 hours under a heat lamp, yet I'd only sat and waited for it for about 15 minutes after placing the order.   Tonight, their phone system kept saying it was busy, yet I walk in and there are no orders waiting, and no employees on the phones. I asked what was going on, thinking maybe something was wrong with the phones, and they said they only have one line. One line?! For a place with a takeout option?????  Last visit, I tried to use a birthday coupon that was 1 day expired and the manager literally huffed, puffed, and scoffed at me before honoring it. Sorry, I'll pay the $4 next time to avoid the mistreatment.   Awful. Just awful.   Probably going to drive the extra mile to the Warm Springs location going forward. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Is there a better place to get wings and watch some games? Maybe but not in Monroeville. (I rank the Rivertowne as a more complete restaurant but this review is based on wings only).   The staff are good, the service is fast and the wings - so many varieties of sauces. I'm a fan of the mango habanero, asian zing and spicy garlic. But it's hard to go wrong with any of their varieties. Love me some b-dubs!"}
{"text":"Boo. Service blows. Prepare to wait forever and a day. A lot of servers and no service..."}
{"text":"Walking in, I noticed it was totally remodeled and it looks really nice. It's been a few years since I have been in the location. The host stand greeted us and were polite.  Walking to our table i noticed the floors were really dirty (food and trash not picked up) and after we sat I saw the menus had crud on them. For it being as dead as it was, it took a while for our server to come ask for our drink order (which she was absent most the evening). We ordered a basket of potato wedges (which is supposed to come loaded with sour cream and green onion) and we added bacon. We got a basket with potatoes and bacon. I ordered a side of sour cream and they yummy once again! The chili queso was yummy as always but the chips were SOOOOO salty.. our wings were pretty good. My hubs got boneless mango habanero and sweet bbq (the bbq ones were a bit dry and hubs didn't like them too much) and I got  the traditional (flats only) at medium. Mine were pretty good I just have an issue with broken bones. To end the night we got the cheesecake bites which are always delish!  Not a big fan of coming here anymore. I dunno. I like some things I just feel as if they need to work customer service and food quality."}
{"text":"I love the food and the customer service is just don't like how long it takes to find parking.and every time I order  my food it takes almost an hour besides that I love the happy hour and drinks"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots. The wings are on point. Good looking great friendly service. The wing of the month never disappoints. Food always comes in a nice timely fashion. Can't say enough for a franchise wing spot. A1"}
{"text":"I'm always down to come here on days they have their deals on wings especially because of the many flavors they offer compared to other places.   Mango habanero and honey BBQ are my go to flavors. Garlic Parmesan too if I want something simple. To top it off, a tall glass of blue moon with an orange. Delicious meal!   Happy Hour Mondays - Fridays 2pm-7pm, 10pm-6am. This location is open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I am blown away at the service here.  I did not see one server doing a good job, acting as if they cared,or even  bothered with their tables unless it what an absolute necessity. I really didn't want to give it one star. To top it off the  fake nachos were awful!!"}
{"text":"First time at this location . It was great fast to be seated and friendly staff .   Waitress was excellent ."}
{"text":"Great wings and atmosphere.  The place is new so it looks good and feels good.  Service is a bit slow and food can take a while to get to you when they are busy.  This is something they need to work on but that won;t stop me from returning to this particular one.  (Go Bears)!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome (as usual) but service is lousy. Went in there recently and the place was near empty.  We had a party of six and the food took forever to come out and our waitress was very very slow. We were even afraid to ask for boxes in fear that it'll be another 15 minutes before we got them. Finally after giving us the bill, we see her 10 min later chatting it up with her coworkers while we wait. A dinner in an empty restaurant with a party of six that should've taken 90 min AT MOST, took 2.5 hrs. Yikes."}
{"text":"All good at bww!!! Great food great service fast and accurate! !! First trip here was not good but this time was great. Thank you! !!"}
{"text":"I usually come here on Tuesdays when they have their special on $0.60 wings! Each wing (bone in) is 60 cents on Tuesdays. I always get Parmesan garlic and chipotle BBQ. Sometimes I get Thai curry and mild. Occasionally I also get their seasoned fries with either chipotle BBQ seasoning or a side of Parmesan garlic sauce.   BWW is a great place to hang out with friends, watch games, and eat great food!"}
{"text":"I was craving for some chicken wings so I searched on Yelp and the closest place I found was here. So I went there at 1:30am and found the best deal I've seen by far! 45 cent PER wing! My eyes bugged when I saw how great the deal was. 16 wings for $7.89!!! Now that, my friends, is a place you'll never want to miss out if you're looking for cheap but good buffalo wings. Plus they open for 24 hours. Though the dine area is closed during late night hours, you can still chill in the bar area. Nothing beats beer, sports on 70 inch HDTV, and of course, buffalo wings right?"}
{"text":"Daughter been wanting to take me here since we have moved in the area. fiinally had a chance last night. I love my wings. So I ordered their honey bbq wings with fries. First! We were seated inside, had to request to be moved outside in the patio. Way to loud, we couldn't even talk to each other. Second! We were outside and it was like recess at the local elementary school. They were all over the place running and bumping into each other. While there parents were inside drinking. Third! Their food was alright, Wings were very tasty but not heated, Fries were like they were the leftovers. Yes I would like to come back and try it again, I'll give everything a second chance. But this place needs a lot of improvements."}
{"text":"Jorge was our server, seen him working the Mayweather fight night. Very friendly, checked on us frequently also informed us on his inexperience of Morning shifts ( since he works nights more often) so we weren't gonna be to demanding on him.   Con: Arrived around 9:45 (before eagles kick off at 9:55) bf ordered a Bloody Mary to start off with, The Bartender did not make it properly, was not properly mixed, apparently there was a small confusion / miscommunication of some sort they were probably making a different drink realized it was a Bloody Mary then corrected it, after adding some pepper and Stirring in around a lot more it was better all the alcohol was suspended to the top of the beverage.   Pro: Booth was clean, Service was good, The games were on it was nice and busy, Game day was definitely In affect. I ordered a Small order of wings, all Flats extra crispy it was Great. Jorge let me taste test two different sauces if you like spicy go with that New Mango Sauce they have i didn't want heart burn at 9 am so I wanted a mild one I picked the honey BBQ instead Jorge Suggested the Blue moon BBQ sauce and I went with that. Wings came out fast, crispy, and Saucy. There were no complaints there. My BF ordered a : breakfast club sandwich with fries Cane out very good and came out quickly.   Overall today this place gets a 4/5 stars the Only down fall was the Bloody Mary which is a SMALL hiccup that I'm sure is not a frequent issue.   Food is always great: I recommend people get that Cali chicken sandwich DO NOT FORGET THE CILANTRO LIME RANCH DRESSING"}
{"text":"Just had the rudest waiter tonight. One of my friends lost her wallet and only had a photo of her passport. Our waiter was a black man and he gave my friend a thumbs up and laughed about it. THEN he comes back and rudely says to my friend \"do you have an actual card or not?\" And tells her she can't stay at the bar. It's fine if said it the first time around and wasn't a dick about it. Needless to say I left"}
{"text":"This is pretty much our \"Go-To\" for sporting events and some Golden Tee. A good variety of food with great service. I haven't had a bad experience there yet. Love the new menu and selection of beers!"}
{"text":"We ordered from this place through door dash. Order was cold, missing tons of items. Food was terrible! Dry tough burger. Cold tasteless fries. When I called them they pushed it off o. Door dash! Well door dash didn't make the food! Never again. Terrible! Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"The staff is really nice, but the food took FOREVER. They should think about hiring a whole new kitchen staff"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm giving Buffalo Wild Wings 4 stars. This is a rarity, but this location is nostalgic for me and has never let me down. I lived not far from here during the 5+ years I lived in Las Vegas, and when this spot opened my friends and I didn't go anywhere else. The bar staff  and their service was always terrific (even at 4am), and the happy hour specials cannot be beat. It's open 24 hours and the food is bar quality consistent! I rarely eat at Buffalo Wild Wings since I moved away, but this location holds a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wild Wings the wings are always great flat  wings if you want which it is always a plus in my book drinks at great to never watery there open 24 hours and they also give discounts for military etc."}
{"text":"I had buffalitos and chilli cheese dip and both were not very good at all. Very boring and bland. The cheese dip tasted like old melted cheese wiz with maybe a teaspoon of Chilli.  It is definitely not worth what you pay for. I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Watching the HEAT game! Stephanie is the best server hands down. She makes the BWW experience unique and makes you want to come back because she always comes to say hi whether she is waitressing our table or not."}
{"text":"If you plan on placing an order for pickup with the expectation that it'll be a quick and convenient idea for dinner, think again.  Last night, my sister and I went to this location and placed an order for TWO wraps and an appetizer.  The little girl with a horrible attitude at the pickup desk, ARLENE, read our order back to us and I stopped short when I didn't think I had heard both wraps be read back.  I asked her if she got both wraps to which she nodded her head enthusiastically while my sister joked to her that there was no way our total would only be for one wrap and an appetizer, which ARLENE laughed at with us.  We left for the requisite 15 minutes to Vons and after that time, I went back to get our order.  Arlene brought my bag of food around and opened every container for me to see, but I noticed that there was only one wrap in the bag, so I asked her where the second wrap was.  She tells me, \"you only ordered one.\"  I lost it.  I RE-PLACED the order, went outside to grab my debit card and gave it to my sister for her to handle the order...again!  Apparently, my sister voiced her frustrations to this girl and was met with no apathy or readiness to please the customer due to her error.  My sister asked how long it would be for the additional food and Arlene told her it would be another fifteen minutes, at which point my sister expressed how upset she was that the rest of our food would be cold by then. Arlene's respone?  \"There's really nothing I can do about that.\"  After waiting an additional fifteen minutes for the rest of our order, Arlene held up the bagged item for my sister who snatched it angrily out of her hands.  Rather than let my sister's anger be the ending to this horrible experience, she closed the night off with a sarcastic and loud, \"Friendly!\" remark to the other waiting customers.  UNACCEPTABLE!!!    This yelp will be superceded by a call to this location's manager and, if nessecary, further action up the corporate chain.  My advice to Arlene is that if you don't want a job that involves customer service and having to deal with upset customers, especially when you mess up and can't even take responsibility for it, then find something else that would benefit from your limited skill set."}
{"text":"Order took a long time. Place wasn't busy so not sure what the hold up was. This was about a week ago. The staff is friendly.  I may be back. My girlfriend accidentally ate a spicy mango habanero wing.  It was the highlight of my visit."}
{"text":"Completely sucks! I got sick right after eating my wings. My best friend's wings were completely wrong twice. They came out as medium when asked for a mild. Then we let them know that is was medium and they just tossed them in the mild sauce while they were still meduin. My lemon pepper was LIGHTLY tossed, when I asked for extra lemon pepper they gave me a different seasoning and had hardly any seasoning. Would definitely not recommend this buffalo wild wings."}
{"text":"Extreamly overpriced! Food was average at best and took forever to get drink refills."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. waitress talked to her friends and co workers the whole time and didn't even put our order in. waited an hour and a half for our. food to come out and nothing we actually ordered came out. don't waste your time here, go to a different BWW"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was alright it was busy so I'm not holding that against anyone. However, you should probably have staff consistently card- because I watched a server serve underage kids alcohol. - would really like for this place to not get closed down for a stupid preventable violation"}
{"text":"Went there tonight to watch the baseball game and had a blast.  Our server Zach was on point! He kept our drinks refilled and kept on eye on our table as one of our guest ordered the blazing wings. He made suggestions to take the edge off which were all very helpful. He brought a fruit punch and a cup of ice cream to cool him off.  Thanks for looking out!"}
{"text":"I moved here from CA and didn't know that there were 24 hour BWW around!! Really sad that they now have small (10 wings, $10 something), medium (15 wings $15), large (20 wings, $20). I'm not even sure if you can order individual wings anymore. But looking at those prices, its going be a dollar per wing... which is on the pricer side considering that I can eat 10 like nothing. I always order the parmesan garlic and lemon pepper. I've tried other flavors before like their mango habanero and asian zing but those were way too spicy.   This location is like other locations, but more chaotic it feels like. Super dark inside, with a ton of large screens all around the restaurant.   If you're over 21, skip the wait and go to the bar.   Tuesdays Bone IN wings are $0.70 and Thursdays BoneLESS wings are $0.70. I remember them being only $0.50...   I ordered to go and didn't have to wait long for my small order which came with 2  sides of bleu cheese. They don't taste very good once you microwave them though."}
{"text":"I should have known better. BWW is a big chain after all, it could mean good things or bad. I try to avoid them  Despite the fact my server took my order, they no longer carry jalapeño poppers, first disapointment. Not his fault though.  For the wings I selected the garlic/parmesean 5 and another 5 of the Thai style. Both were very salty. I was only able to eat 4 of 10.  Since they have a wing special on Tuesdays, they charge you extra for celery and carrots."}
{"text":"I went to this Buffalo Wild Wings not long ago with my family and ended up there before a game so it got pretty busy quick. I could see it being slow. For me it seemed ok, we didn't wait too long, but we probably beat the rush. My family thought the food was pretty good. Of course its loud and there is a lot going on, but that is the type of restaurant that it is. Same as the other few locations I have been at."}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch on a busy Friday afternoon around 1 pm. Were seated promptly and waitress stopped by and took our drinks order. We waited a few minutes to figure out what we wanted for food. Ordered our food and I swear it was out within 10 minutes. Everything tasted fresh and the waitress was friendly for the most part. Bill was $22 and i handed her $30, she had the nerve to ask if I needed change? No I'm just going to leave you an $8 tip. The service had room for improvement, obviously.   Overall the food was good, fun environment, just a greedy waitress."}
{"text":"Standard BWW fare, good selection of beers.   +Stella on tap +Lunch Specials  -Slow Service -Beers can be pricey."}
{"text":"First time here, service was slow. It wasn't busy (Thursday) when we got there at 5:30, but they were getting crowded about 7:30 when we were leaving.  We order wings & two burgers.  Should have stuck with the wings, burger was dry & not tasty.   May try another location (where I heard good things about service & food)"}
{"text":"Well...where do I start. I had a late flight into Pittsburgh and everything was closed in the airport so I said hey why not Buffalo Wild Wings? Walked in with my luggage and the staff saw a damsel in distress. They offered to charge my phone and give me a beer menu asap. Had a bud light and an Oktoberfest which were the specials. The beers were great. Very friendly staff and the bar tender (Katie) was super friendly. I don't like the steelers but I like a good buffalo wing and a cold beer. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Only the bartender to assist you at 1am. Wasn't very busy but enough tyhat he struggled a bit to keep up with everyone. One bartender/server and about 20 guests. He managed to do a pretty good job though. Food came in a very timely manner and was all that on would expect from a BWW. Late night eats and drinks. All In all.... worthy of several revisits."}
{"text":"Food is great but service for food and even drinks takes FOREVER make sure you have No plans the rest if the night when coming here as you will spend most time waiting for service."}
{"text":"WE went here when it first opened to watch a Boxing match.  We got there an hour early but still had to sit outside and it was a bit warm. There weren't many TV\"s outside so that made it uncomfortable to see one.   The food is good. Got wings of course and I like that there are so many options for the sauce.  It was really busy there so the service wasn't the best. But it is like that everywhere on a fight night.  Anyways, we would go back because it is a fun environment to watch fights at."}
{"text":"Will NOT return to this location the only good customer service was the bus boy this is a location by the cardinals stadium so unprofessional and happy hour is 10-12 not 10-11:56 sorry but if my phone's time says 4 minutes there's no damn way your clock shouldn't be 7mins off seriously?? Surprise location is way better screw this location! I tipped my bus boy more than the waitress!!"}
{"text":"I'm sure the food will be good, but let me get to the problem with this place...  I placed an order online and it let me put 6:40 as the pick up time. I get here at 6:20 and they tell me they don't have my order. I tell the girl behind the counter it was to be picked up at 6:40, oh surprise now she finds it. She then goes on to tell me that their system won't get the order until 6:40, um WTF. So I ask to speak to the manager who just says the same thing the girl said, but adds it's a system/BWW thing. When I ask what kind of sense that makes he agrees that it doesn't. Yet only says they'll put my order in now and that's it. Talk about horrible customer service!  I don't really care who's fault it is, get your sh*t together people! And when you mess up, do something to make up for it."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out and it was tasty. It was ready right on time and had utensils, napkins and handy naps. Definitely will oder again."}
{"text":"I've gone here multiple times and it's been normal experiences each time until recently...I don't know what's up with the rude hostess but can I please just get some food without being scoffed at. I usually don't take time out to write a whole review, however this last visit really bothered me. And my to-go chicken was seasoned sloppily/chicken pieces smallest I've ever gotten."}
{"text":"I used to love BW3 but it seems to be going downhill. My office ordered a wing extravaganza for our office. Half the office ended up sick. We were also disappointed in March when we did the same thing. Wings were poorly sauced. We did order a lot but gave plenty of notice. I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"I've had good and bad service here. Four minute wait time to get to a table to take a drink order is not acceptable. Not when there's 7 servers on the floor and 6 tables of people in the whole restaurant. Not in my opinion. At least greet them to let them know your alive. When I worked Olive Garden we had a 30 second greeting. Not here but I'm one for screening employees before you hire them: math test, reading test, reasoning, time them on how fast they can fill out a job app. Food is pretty good I guess. I like the Thursday wing special. Beer prices are fair. Plan on spending 20 bucks a person here. Most recent visit:  The host was high as a kite. Took him 5 minutes of him looking at us to connect dots and realize he ought to seat us. He walked 5 steps and gave us the nearest booth. We saw our server three times in the two hours we were there. Drink ticket times were 20 minutes. Our drink order, iced tea, was repeatedly wrong.  We wanted more food and drinks but we weren't willing to wait 45 more minutes to get more items so we cashed out and left. Badly understaffed. Parking is tough. Nice location. Take the other reviewers reviews seriously. There's truth somewhere in the middle. Always."}
{"text":"I was in here yesterday and won't be back. Ever. Not if you paid me. Everything went wrong from start....to finish. The host attempted to seat us. Walked in said \"two?\" He turned around and walked away without saying a word and after a minute realized we weren't behind him because we didn't know if he was seating us, checking on a table, hello? After walking a 1/4 mile to our table which was way out in like New Delhi or something, we are seated near nobody and nothing. He dropped us off at our table in the desert which was dirty, obscure and lonely. The place was filthy, shabby, tired worn down. The next three hours, yes three, were an adventure. Our drinks took 15-20 minutes, our server looked like he just got out of county jail, our food actually arrived before the appetizers. We didnt see the guy for another 45 minutes. When the escapee arrived, he brought the carryout box the size of a pizza container we requested from another server that saw us stranded on the side of the highway. Meanwhile in the dining room, there was loud cheering  because there was a baseball game going on. In our room, the game was not on. We couldn't see anyone but we knew they were there. Then we got the check. We didn't see the guy for another twenty minutes after that. I stacked the dirty plates in the corner of the table. We left with our frozen carryouts. By the way, the beer was cold and the food was ok. All on a Friday night. Behind every bad server, bad host and bad staff is a bad general manager. Loser restaurant of the year goes to *ding* bdubs of Lyndhurst. Congratulations!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick lunch, and the boneless Asian Zing were the best !"}
{"text":"So we came here once and the service was pretty slow and our waitress was rude, but it was really busy so we understood a bit. However here now as I type this, on a slow Monday afternoon, after sitting at our table for 20 minutes we had to flag someone down so we could place our order. And now a full hour after arriving we still haven't received our food. It shouldn't take this long to cook 1 burger and fry up 1 order of shrimp. If it was busy in here, somewhat understandable. Last time well be coming here."}
{"text":"website says closes at 12, it's 10:43 on a thursday night and we were told it's closed , ...but then Tom came to the rescue, thank you Tom, all the other people working here ignored us, hosts, other waiters/waitresses ...thumbs up to Tom, thank you sir for coming to the rescue, you're awesome!, someone needs to change the info on website to closing time is 10:00pm , \"wing nuts \" and \"wing stop \" are both open for business past 10p...thanks again"}
{"text":"This place sucks.  My family has tried several locations.  Half decent food. God awful service.  Took 10 minutes to get drinks, we ordered our meal with our drinks. Sat for 45 minutes before we got our food. Our appetizer (chips and queso) came after our meals. One out of 4 plates had hot food. No one ever came back to check on us while waiting. No refill on drinks. Our waiter barely made eye contact.  We decided this was our last try. If we ever eat from here again it will be to go."}
{"text":"This is our go to BWW. Funny story my boyfriends birthday is on Christmas. This is where we traditionally come every year. The staff is always fun and friendly. The food is always good. I couldn't be more thankful for this restaurant they are usually a busy location on the weekends but, if your over 21 don't hesitate to sit at the bar they have a great happy hour and the drinks are so tasty! If you find it to be busy don't be surprised to see the manager on the floor taking your order, it's always great to see that happening. It gives it an un micromanaged and a family team place. Great for watching sports and have a \"family night\". Thank you BWW! You guys are a great team."}
{"text":"This has been an awesome good time with great food and a good environment would recommend to anybody"}
{"text":"Is it just me or has the service and the food quality of this place completely gone in the sh!tter?? Came here tonight after 8:00. There was about 2 parties ahead of us. We asked to place our name on the list and the guy wrote us in. We took a seat and sat for about 5-10 minutes before we started to notice that people just walking in we're getting seats before us. We questioned it and the guy admitted he took our name off the list for unknown reasons. He put our name back on the list and we waited another 5 minutes for a seat.  It wasn't surprising that the waitress was MIA for almost 10 minutes before someone came to ask us what we wanted to drink. We decided to put our food order in with our drinks. It was only after she took and submitted our order she then told us that it would take 30 minutes for our food to come out... I'm sorry...30 MINUTES?!? How do you not prepare for a dinner rush??  We ended up just walking out and eating elsewhere. Highly unlikely, given the fact service just keeps getting worse and worse each visit, that we'll be returning."}
{"text":"So we go in at 2am on a sunday because the sign read 24 hours. We walk in and everything is turned over and shut down, we were ignored upon arriving. We had to walk up to the bar and they told us we had to order to go and kicked us out of the little bar area because we had minors. We just wanted some wings but besides that other times ive been there the service was CRAP they are really good at ignoring people.."}
{"text":"The food is alright. However don't expect much from the service. Talked to a manager about my inconveniences and right as I was walking out the door they were already snitching on my complaint. By the way, if you're really hungry and want a QUICK eat don't go here as they'll only fill your sauce half way AND change you for it. I remember when this restaurant had higher standards I can buy better frozen wings at Costco. And not get judged out the door."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place. For the people who complain about any wait on food or a table, you can SEE how many people are sitting in the restaurant. Go to Little Caesars down the street on a Friday night if you want your wings in 2 minutes.  I'm so happy this location reopened. The TVs are great, you can easily watch like 3 games at a time from the bar tables.  My husband and I are treated like regulars whenever we walk in. The wings are awesome- order them crispy and wet for the perfect meal."}
{"text":"This is the place to be on UFC fight nights because they put out extra tables so you can watch the fight for free!  The service can get tricky since it does get really packed and busy.  If you are planning to watch the fight there I suggest going early and just hanging out.  Other than that the wings are great just like any other night!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past 2 years with my workmates. Great service, great waitress, great food and great FUN.  Love this place."}
{"text":"First off, I do love Buffalo Wild Wings.  The original wings with buffalo seasoning are delicious! The food here was okay, my wings were broken and having shards of bone stick out of your food is not appetizing to say the least.  The cheesecake bites were great!  The review is mostly for the service, which was for lack of a better word TERRIBLE.  The waitress sauntered over while chewing gum, as if she was doing us a favor, and took our orders but did not write anything down.  She had to ask a few times for us to repeat it, while still getting the drink wrong.  Mind you there are only two of us, so it should not have been such a feat.  Our orders came out wrong, wrong side dish but we did not mention anything at that point as to not have to deal with it anymore. Overall, she seemed more focused on serving groups of guys seated all around then any other customer."}
{"text":"Wings are decent and are on the 'lean' side, which isn't a bad thing.  Loved the french fries as they are the same cut and taste as McDonalds fries, but better.  Service is top notch and they really want you to feel welcome.  This place is a no-brainer if you want to catch a game and have beer & wings at the same time."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. This BWW has gone down significantly. Tried them again tonight, going out had improved. Nope. The seasoning was on point, very tasty, but on what seemed like old wings that had been sitting under the heat lamps the entire day. Completely dry and hard. Totally a waste of money. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars but I shall explain. I always place my order to go. I never have to wait, food is never cold, and they get it right the first time BUT everytime I get wings from here I always regret it because 45 mins later I'm spraying all over the toilet bowl. I always have diarrhea and it doesn't help that I order hot wings either. I like eating BWW but blowing the toilet out 2 to 3 times in 2 hours and having to clean the aftermath isn't worth it. I'd consider giving them 4 stars if they hook it up with some toilet paper the next time I order from them. Other than that, they cool."}
{"text":"The manager really needs to put a no cell phone policy in place unless the bartenders and wait staff are on break! Every time I come in here there is staff on their phone and not taking care of customers"}
{"text":"We went last night with our kids and all of us got sick with stomach cramps and the runs. Had to have been BWW."}
{"text":"This location closed down when the food and service was bad, a few years back.  It remained closed for almost 2 years and I see it closing again real soon.  The food looks and tastes like frozen dinners, microwaved to order.  The servers are nowhere to be found when you need them, until you go to the bar and start ordering your own drinks and food.  Let's get something else here already because BWW just can't get it right."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0  Left my keys here last night, so this morning after realizing they weren't at my place I called them. My first call was short, I was told my probable wasn't important enough and that I need to call back in 10 minutes. So I did, new person answered, I was put on hold for 5 minutes then someone picked up and asked if I would like to place an order...I said no I'm trying to find my keys, instantly put on hold again. 5 minutes later I hung up because I already was on my way in a friend's cars. I walk in to an empty restaurant (clearly I didn't need to be put on hold for extensive periods of time) and I was obviously frustrated. I approach a few workers and said hi since calling didn't get me answers I'm here to see if you guys found my keys. She asked me to describe them and the second I did she started to walk away to grab them. I expressed that I was confused as to why that couldn't have happened over the phone. And she made rude remarks under her breath as she walked away.  Not to mention the food was pretty shitty the night before   Never coming back, bye"}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Vegas to get some wings. They have a variety of flavors, garlic parmesan and mango habanero being my favorite. Buffalo Wild Wings or BWW as I like to call also has a bar for those who like to drink, a great place to eat with the family. Here in Vegas it's open 24 hours for those with late night appetites. They also show free PPV's like UFC fights."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ever. The wait staff took over an hour and it was cold. The management staff and wait staff were not very capable of handling the crowd. The waitress could not properly pass out menus to the entire table. They were just very clueless. This was a mess. I will not be visiting this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Eat with caution!!! We went on Thursday to get discount boneless wings and the waitress convinced us to get the lunch specials instead, which she said would be a better deal-- they totally weren't. The manager refused to give us the lower price, and then when we received our to-go order, it was incorrect. We sent it back, and the manager himself said he looked over it. Upon getting home, we started eating, and suddenly my brother started choking. It turns out that hidden in our batch of boneless wings was ONE bone-in wing. Fortunately, one of us knew the Heimlich. I guess just ask yourself, are buffalo wild wings worth risking your life?"}
{"text":"If I were rating BWW of wings alone it would get four stars.  Although they are a little small, the wings are nicely prepared and I really love the number of sauce options available.  You can go with a group of people and they have a flavor for everyone.  The seasoned potato wedges are delicious as well and a prefect side for the wings.  Obviously this review is not a four star...but why?  Let me preface the following by saying that I am mainly a late night customer.  I work until midnight and used to love stopping by after work for a dozen or so wings and a cold beer.  The problem is that in a city that has late night everything, they are failing to compete.  At my regular location there is a new bartender every time I go in there which makes it impossible to develop a relationship with someone.  All this leads to is being ignored by the new guy every time I go in.  Another problem is that the late night specials have all but vanashed.  The PT's 200 yards down the street has 50% off all drinks and apps, but BWW has a few discounted apps and only one domestic draught beer special.  Maybe I'm being too particular, but when I truly want to come in once a week for some food and drink and I am usually the only person there, maybe it's time to re-examine your pricing.  Bottom line, offer some late night specials and I will forget that the new guy hasn't looked at me in 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Went in around 11pm on a Saturday night and this place wasn't very busy. Our server only had one table (ours) and completely disappointed us. We ordered a couple of beers and took about 10-15 minutes to get them to our table. Then we ordered the snack size wings for me and the buffalo grilled cheese for my husband. When we got our food (which took longer than should have for only being about 5 tables in the entire restaurant) I noticed that I only had 4 wings in my basket when the menu specifically says \"at least 5\" for the snack size. So I asked the server politely about it, because I understand it's not always the servers fault. He responded saying \"on really? Well the number changes every week.\"... Then why does your menu say \"at least 5\"? He then told me he would get me another one. As for my husbands food, it was cold right off the bat, and only had a few small pieces of chicken. Time went by and we finished eating what we had. Our server brought our bill and I never did receive that last wing. Pretty disappointing service for being his only table. I can only image what he's like with a full section. I wouldn't have minded if he had just told me that they were out of wings for the night (if that were the case) by laziness doesn't fly in my book.   Ps. I gave this place 2 stars because it was the nicest bww I've been in so far. But that's not all you need to make a good restaurant. Hire some hard workers, Buffalo!"}
{"text":"I've been to other BWWs and the wings tasted great. This time the food was super bland. I couldn't taste the Honey BBQ off the wings at all. Maybe it was just because it was football sunday..."}
{"text":"I often don't do one star reviews but I had to be honest .  I came with my borfriend and we were pretty excited to try you Guys out but it was shocked what we witness...... Was probably the worst experience I've ever had and really uncomfortable customer service was not that great need to work on just a little bit more nervous . The guy that was a host was rude . Waiter (Allison ) was nice, she seemed nervous and took 15 minutes to get refills and just to check up how everything was doing . Thank you have a goodnight"}
{"text":"I've very much in a wings & beer phase at the moment, so I was excited to try BWW on a recent Vegas trip. Compared to Wingstop, I like the wings here much better - they're tender and juicy yet still crispy and crunchy on the outside, and they have so many more flavors to choose from. Caribbean jerk was my favorite of the 5 or so we tried (tons of heat and flavor), with Azian zing coming in a close second. The garlic parmesan was a bit dry, but they did bring us a little cup of the sauce on the side.   Not sure if this is so with all their locations, but this one had many big screen TVs with different games on around the room. Great place for game day. Also, this is the only place I've been to that gives you more ranch than you could ask for! Being someone who must dip every bite (wings, fries, celery, you name it), I was very impressed. I'll definitely try and make it back (to another location, obviously) to try more flavors!"}
{"text":"I always choose to come here instead of the one on las Vegas Blvd., just because it gets way too packed there.  Usually come on a Tuesday during happy hour to get the best of both worlds... wings Tuesday plus happy hour.  Service is alright. Got our drinks quick but food takes a pretty long time. And it's a hit or miss on how much sauce they put on the wings. I sometimes have to get extra just cause the wings come out dry."}
{"text":"The place is great, the food was really good, I loved the jalapenos appetizer and the crispy chicken sandwich was delicious! I also liked the service, it was fast and efficient. I totally recommend this place for lunch and a quick beer!"}
{"text":"this Buffalo Wild Wings is the worst. service is awful. orders are always wrong and they are very slow."}
{"text":"The chicken ain't cheap, but neither is the beer...  Oh, and my wife got the deep fried pickles and they were GROSS. The pickles were very slimy and for a minute I thought I was eating food that someone had spit on... Maybe I was.. Bleh!"}
{"text":"the food was good. service was slow, even ordered ahead and waited a good 20 mins. lots of construction going on, no parking."}
{"text":"First time here and wasn't good service even the manager kinda blew us off when we asked for more water and the waiter forgot my lemonade and brought me water instead... Food was great! But the service... Yeah wouldn't recommend or return to this location"}
{"text":"My go to weekly NFL spot.  I arrive every week at 9am and stay till the Sunday night games.  It's a cheers like atmosphere where you know everyone.  Brenda is always my server and she already knows what i want to eat and drink.  The food is consistent.   It's not gourmet but they consistently put out good food at affordable prices.  Great spot for NFL, college football, UFC and Boxing PPV events."}
{"text":"Carlos and Jennifer were awesome! Our beer was cold quick and delicious. They were both very friendly and we had a great time.   The boneless wings were really good and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff is friendly, food is great, never had bad service. The mangers are very friendly and everyone will bend over backwards to make your experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"There is a reason the Yelp ratings for BWW is so low.  I showed up today hoping to watch one of my favorite NCAA mens basketball teams play.  When I arrived, I was literally the only person in the place.  The manager knew I was there to watch a particular game, but pointed to it on a small screen.  When the wait staff asked for my order, I asked if the game was going to be moved to a larger screen.  The manager conveyed back that he would put the game I wanted to watch on a bigger screen, but would not put it on audio -- he would keep it muted.  He had two other games that he wanted audio for.  Again, I was the only customer in the place.  i left, and went to Zipps, where they graciously accommodated my request.  The manager at Zipps even came by to make sure I was being well taken care of.  Zipps cares about you; BWW could care less."}
{"text":"Decided to go here after a movie . Even though it was crowded, we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. We had the dry seasoned lemon pepper , salt and vinegar and barbecue and the spicy garlic wings. The waitress , Kelly suggested that we try their specialty \"grand slam\" beer to go with the wings. I must say that I was impressed. My only suggestion would be to add more seasoning! Oh and ask for Kelly !"}
{"text":"This is my boys favorite place to go to for wings and since they both had good report cards they got to name the place tonight. Buffalo Wild Wings it was but we decided to try the uptown location this time. I should have looked at the reviews before we decided on the location but I didn't and I regretted it. We were immediately seated and acknowledged by our waiter. After placing our order we waited for at least 45 minutes and our order still wasn't right. We asked for crispy wings and needless to say they were far from crispy. The manager did acknowledge our wait and provided us with a discount."}
{"text":"So annoying havnt had wings in years here and I ordered them to go . The girl in the front gave me one part of my order then I said where are my wings she's like oh yeah , I ordered 15 crispy she came back with 5 .. I said I ordered 15 she goes one sec , was in back for a good 8 min . I'm standing there frustrated . Then she comes and goes here u are . The wings were wrong and I feel like they were really old wings she put sauce on them soo mad !!! Don't recommend"}
{"text":"I'm in B'Dubs now, at the bar. I try to order a half and half with Guinness and an IPA, and the bartender acts as if I'm some kind of alien. \"There is no button for that, that can't be done.\" A bar that can't pour a drink because of IT issues, way too corporate for me. After that the guy didn't even try to ask for my food order. 15 minutes now.  Plus they are out of the sauce that I enjoy. Not the best representation of this chain. I wouldn't recommend to a friend or stranger."}
{"text":"The second star  is for great service but food wise it was bad - over grilled , over fried, over dry , over salty and just very cheap food for your $$;  the drinks are good like in any other place I guess.... they can do better"}
{"text":"I usually order online through DoorDash, so only can comment on the quality of the food. I usually order a few different flavors, my favorite being Asian zing, Jamaican jerk and the honey bourbon. I've probably only had a couple of instances where I've ordered a flavor and not enjoyed it, but that's personal preference. Sometimes I just feel like pigging our on wings, and although they're not the best wings I've ever had, they definitely do the job! The last few times I've ordered, the food has taken ages to arrive (last time it said 45 min delivery, ended up being over an hour, not sure if that's BWW or DoorDash), and a few times my order has been incomplete or missing items. Count how many wings you get! Last time I was shortchanged by 2 wings, and this wasn't the first time it has happened. Stick to wings, I've ordered nachos and burgers before and they were disappointing."}
{"text":"Me and my family have come to this location because I am in love with wings, just regular hot wings, and they are DELISIOUS here. But I always leave so disappointed in their customer service, all three times we've been here there's a ton of staff walking around and I always seem to be waiting forever to get service. No hellos, no how's everything, nothing, it looks like they spend more time chatting with each other than trying to impress the customers so we can come back. Anyone who knows me well knows I'm a great tipper, but not if I get poor service, I work in the industry so it saddens me when I see bad customer service like we did here, there are so many opportunities to make someone's day, even if it's not your table, just say hi, but it's like we were bothering them for coming in. WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!! So now I have to find a new place to get amazing wings. :-("}
{"text":"Decided to go there late last night and was surprised to see it pretty busy. The noise level was a lot louder than norma, but that really didn't bother us too much. It made talking a challenge but we worked around it.   Service was pretty good, although our server seemed a little agitated at points but overall service was good.  The food was on point as always and came out pretty fast.  Food  Pretzels - 4 Stars - Nice & Soft and better with the Queso Dip Cheese Curds - 5 Stars - Tasted even better with the Marinara sauce. A very nice size portion.  WIngs - 4 Stars - Nice and Meaty - Could be cooked a hair longer to make them slightly more crispy.  Chicken Wrap - 4 Stars - Solid Dish  Cinnamon Squares - 4 Stars - Fine without the caramel sauce, but is awesome when you use the caramel sauce  Cheesecake Bites - 5 Stars - Nice and Creamy, full of flavor."}
{"text":"The customer service is not great, seems like a lot of teenagers are running the place. From the time I walked in I saw a lot of playing around and conversation between the employees and not enough attention on the customers. The wings were ok, not the best I have had compared to other Bdubs, there was not enough sauce on the wings and it looked as if they were just thrown in my To go box."}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings is laid out much more nicely than some of the others I've been to. TVs everywhere, including right over your tables, and good lighting so you can actually see your food. And the wings, of course, are delicious."}
{"text":"Don't bother we had the worst service ever.  It wasn't busy at all and the bar tender kept saying he'd be with us in a min while he waited on people that came in after us.  We ask the manager if she could take are order and she said in a nasty tone that she didn't take orders.  Well I guess they made the right decision making her the manager since obviously this place is mis managed.  It took at least 30mins to put are order in and my food came out but they said they forgot to put my friends food in so he had to wait longer.  Now we're waiting here at the bar for my bill since his was free and were getting ignored again.  Terrible staff and management to say the very least!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to take the time to acknowledge Ryan at this location. Every single time we go he provides excellent service and takes care of us so well. Last night in particular we had a party of 20 people and there were no issues at all. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Buffalo Wild Wings, and I've finally found the worst! Went on a Wednesday night when there were very few people there, and it took 50 minutes to get my wings. The waiter showed up and took our drink order, then apparently clocked out and left. Took 25 minutes to get a beer with no servers coming to check on us after that.  Horrible experience. I sure will not be coming back to this BWW ever. Management needs to fix this problem of terrible service."}
{"text":"Stopped in between classes yesterday with my wife and daughter. Staff is generally enjoyable but the service really sucks. We got there about 4:30pm and sat in the dining area. There were only 3 other very small groups there. Placed our order and waited and waited and waited......   We asked our server to check on the order and waited. The girl finally comes out with our order and says, because we asked for extra crispy and extra wet, this added 4 minutes to the cooking time (30 minute wait), plus, she says, the wings are extra large this time....... huh? She's telling this to us as she's handing us our order and I look....... They actually were smaller than normal, I just about fell out of my chair.  Now on to simple math.... The girls ordered a half dozen wings each and got their 1 cup of dressing with the order, I ordered a dozen and was charged $.50 for the extra cup of dressing... excuse me?   We've decided to NEVER go to this location again. This is the same franchise owner who charges a cover charge for the special UFC events. There are several other locations close by that don't charge and their service is excellent.   We still love Buffalo Wild Wings, we just have to drive an extra minute or two for quality."}
{"text":"The customer service here is TERRIBLE. The girl who answers the phone / does take our orders is awful. I was overly nice to her and she hardly said a word to me, and was constantly rolling her eyes. The place is messy and they rarely clean off the tables & chairs properly. Seriously disappointed in the crew here."}
{"text":"Mediocre service and mediocre food. The server tried taking my brother-in-law's plate before he was done eating....awkward.   Do yourself a favor and find a non-chain restaurant to eat at while in Vegas!! I recommend Earl of Sandwich or Pin-up Pizza over this place, for sure."}
{"text":"We  have been to Buffalo Wild Wings several times. The slow service,  and loud customers, keep me from making this a restaurant on our rotation list. The food is average at best and I have never been a fan of bar food. If you are a sports bar lover, this is the place for you. Tv's everywhere you look. I think too many.  You do have a choice to eat inside or outside on the side patio to escape some of the noise.  The kids love it because they offer a play pad for their busyness wail waiting for the average tasting food. They have a good kids menu and they have no issue finding something, like the corn dogs and fries. I always get the chicken wrap, I am not a fan of greasy finger food. The choices of sauces for wings is very good.  It is hard to watch a sporting event with all the tv's and loud customers. We come because the kids enjoy the food and like the play pad. They have separated the bar and dining area but the noise factor is still there and obnoxious at times. I think it is great for those that love the sports bar experience and atmosphere as well as the bar food.  I have heard many complain about the take out. We have never ordered out and cannot comment. I do have to say each time we have visited, the bathrooms have been clean and well taken care of. I have never had a manager ask about the service or food. The servers have been friendly, but extremely slow, in taking order and receiving food."}
{"text":"This location is a lot smaller than most locations. The wait wasn't very long considering it was a Saturday. Drea was our server she was very accurate in taking our order. She also was very fast and thorough. Not very talkative at all and very little eye contact. But the service was great so who cares, lol. We ordered some tender strips side salad one Caesar salad and a small order of traditional medium buffalo chicken wings ( because they were \"small\" and oh so good I ordered an additional snack )  The food came out piping hot, and relatively fast. And our server made sure our cups were never empty.  I give a five star for service."}
{"text":"I am a fan of their price of wings but it seems that every single time my boyfriend orders his meal, they Never seem to get it right. I have never had an issue with any of the servers at this location or the craig location. The servers and bartenders are always friendly and energetic but I think the kitchen may be lacking in quality."}
{"text":"Can't never go wrong with bdubs! Just that now that I go I tend to order something other than wings! Anyhow must try their blue cheese burger! It's delish! And it's a big portion as well. I did however order Thai curry sauce on the side! ( love that sauce)"}
{"text":"Was at this location yesterday night and the service was mediocre at best. Me and the family visit this buffalo twice a week and that will end as of last night we will take our business else where. Not only did we wait over an hour for the food they were out of certain sauces, some sodas management was very un responsive as Bailey manager on site stated she was new to location. The servers cannot do there job if they are not given the proper tools."}
{"text":"Yesssss!  it is definitely a Sports Lover's Place!  Loads of monitors to watch just about any game live, and the wings are exceptional!!  I like the Caribbean Jerk Sauce----Just the right tang, heat and flavor!----Oh man, does it make me want to take the trip from Highland and 17th to get there right now!---lol  I gave it four stars because the beer selection is mediocre...They don't even have Sierra Nevada Pale Ale on tap....*"}
{"text":"Service was extremely lacking, saw our server to order drinks, food, and to bring us food. Rest of the time he was MIA, never checked in with us. We also had to ask to receive napkins (which should be a no brainer at a wing place). Wings also had way too little sauce. Some were completely bare on one side.   Try to go to the Chandler location if you can, it's way better there."}
{"text":"Here we go again. Roger the manager changed the channel in the 9th inning when we requested to sit in an area for that game. They take their time, eventually change it back but with only 1 out left. He doesn't even come to apologize. He sends a waitress so we have to ask for him. He then just said he was new and sorry and that was it. A rude, not meaningful sorry. Our nice waitress comes to check on us and I asked how long roger had been here. She said 2 years. 2 years?! Wow. Nice lie to loyal clientele."}
{"text":"Always a fun place.  I recognize that Buffalo Wild Wings is a chain and the food is probably similar from restaurant to restaurant. However,  I'm writing this review because of the excellent service we received at this restaurant.   Our server was helpful with showing us the specials, made suggestions on things that would go well together.  He kept our drink full and kept checking on us while we ate.  On this visit we ordered a number of plates to share - including 4 different types of wings - they were all very good - crispy with some nice sauces.  The Blazin sauce was my favorite.  At the end our server offered us a to go drink  and even gave us some extra sauce for our left over wings and told us to take our time, watch the tvs and just let him know if we needed anything else.    Great service will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I Can't go wrong with Bww for some reason. There food isn't the greatest but I do enjoy the wings. I go with the mango habanero always. Its just the right amount of heat for me. My girl can't.take one bite but she tries."}
{"text":"Really like the updates this place has made. There are TV's everywhere and the waitress checked back on us at the right times when we were there to watch a few games.   Nice selection of wing sauces!"}
{"text":"atmosphere is ok but it just costs way too much. Also had a bad experience during a party where we told the waitress we need our check becuase we had to leave early, but she didn't bring it untill about 45 minutes later. All around not worth the money"}
{"text":"Was a typical Friday night crowd at the Place as the playoffs were going for baseball. Hockey games and football games were as well. We got seated and Hannah came and introduced herself to us. We ordered drinks, and then ordered wings with honey barbecue and popcorn shrimp. Hannah was an awesome server and that's why this place got a 3 this time. Food was very long to get to us (35 minutes) and was stale and cold. The mgr came out and apologized to us. She took off the wings and gave us another newer wing order. Finished the meal and headed home. They did a good job and Hannah is kick ass weekend server so try to get her. I just am taking off stars because of the quality of the food when it came out the first time. They need to get it right the first time To get better stars"}
{"text":"It's lucky to get even one star...and the star is only for the wings. First of all, every time I go in there, it's straight up empty. I go here quite a bit and always hope the service gets better and to my surprise, it doesn't. There's never any hosts to greet you, the server takes about 5-10 minutes even to get to the table and all they ask before saying hi is what I want to drink. I even got charged for a side of ranch, and when I questioned it with my server, she said the manager had left which is obviously a lie, but I didn't even care enough to argue over it. The old location on the 101 and Mayo used to be so much better."}
{"text":"More than likely won't come back again.  Food is nothing special and service is slow.  Ask for some place settings and they brought one.  Clearly there is more than one person here.   Same with napkins.  Should not take 20 minutes for bar food."}
{"text":"Great location.  As expected, tons of tv screens, good beer list.  I've been eating BW3 forever.  As much as I love 'em, it's just impossible to overlook a basic like GETTING THE FOOD TO MY TABLE HOT.  Really.  My server was very pleasant, and quick with drink orders, etc., so I'm not sure it was her, but everything arrived cool.  I might give this store another shot, but this was disappointing."}
{"text":"Every time we order ten boneless wings, we always only get 8/9 wings. I don't understand do they not count the wings? I'm paying money for it and they don't even give us the correct amount. We only realize this when open it once we get home by then it's already too much of a hassle to drive back."}
{"text":"My family and I arrived at 7:10P.M. on Thursday August 16, 2012.  We were seated outside which is always trouble at this location.  The table that we were seated at had some type of dressing covering the table.  It wasn't some tiny inconspicuous dressing, I could have dipped my wing in the dressing with enough to go back for seconds.  Finally our server came over to take our order and I pointed out the condiments on the table and he apologized and took care of it in a timely manner. He took our order at 7:15P.M. and it was a very easy order, 18 boneless wings, another order of boneless wings, and French fries.  An acceptable ticket time on thirty wings and a side of fries shouldn't be any longer than fifteen minutes, if that.  It took until 8:00P.M. until after the team captain overheard us starting to complain about the length of time we have been waiting for our food.  She went to check on our order and at that time I realized that the server forgot to place our order.  I use to be a server all through college so I can read what's really going on.  After the Captain walked away to check on our food the server came by to check on our drinks which is a sign from management to go see if he could do anything for us while they expedite our forgotten order.  After waiting over fifty minutes for wings my wife lost her appetite, her daughter had homework to do for school, and I had other business to attend to as well.  We finally had enough and just walked out frustrated, hungry, and unsatisfied.  This isn't the first time that this happened at this location.  About six months ago I had the exact same experience, maybe not as bad as this visit but it was terrible.  I said I would never return again to this location but the general manager called me and tried to make it right.  It worked for my other times I visited but this visit was the icing on the cake.  I'm done with this Buffalo Wild Wings I will never give my business to you again."}
{"text":"Lame. ASU VS Oregon no sound until the 3rd quarter in Favor of Patriots V Miami and why so we care in Scottsdale? Not like Patriots are playing a good team.  ASU fans....no more Buffalo Wild Wings"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I called in an order and the girl who took it was a total airhead. Several times she was just dead silent on the phone?!!! ...like her brain couldn't compute a pick up order that only entailed three orders of boneless wings. Then...I was told it would be 5-10 minutes...45 minutes later the food was finally done. I live just a few minutes away and by the time I got home the wings were ice cold and barely had any sauce. I don't understand why this place is always packed, the food is horrible and the service sucks. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Have ordered carry out MANY times here and the majority of the time I always get dry, no sauce wings. Also the quality of the wings themselves are horrible. DO NOT GO HERE! Fairview Tavern has better wings as well as The Woods and Applebee's."}
{"text":"If I could put zero stars on here I would. First of all our table was surrounded by flys. The manager Joshua's solution was to move us to another table surrounded by flys. They had multiple managers try to explain to us how having flies in a restaurant is just a normal part of the business."}
{"text":"My first experience in this Bufallo Wild Wings Rural branch was horrible!!!  Service: Me and my group was treated so bad, Our waitress was a racist, since I observed  with my own eyes how she treated us differently compared to people who sat right across our table.  During the whole dining experience, We experience lacks of service. Our friends who came in later than us needed to wait 20 minutes to get his orders taken. When our food came, which is almost 30 minutes later, there are a lot of mistakes in flavor of what we ordered. The whole dinner at Buffalo Wild Wings is a disaster. We waited an hour for a crappy food, a lot of mistakes in our order.  Moreover at the end of the dining,  she, the waitress, charged me twice for my drinks because according to her I drank too much of Iced Tea, which supposed to be free refill.  Food: I would gave them a below average, since 2 of 12 wings which I ate that day is slightly under cooks. Some of the fries which we consumed are slightly under cooks too.  Overall: I highly won't recommend this buffalo wild wings branch to anyone!! Terrible Service!!!"}
{"text":"Ah, you know. A place like this you expect microwave bacon on your bacon burger. My beef (no pun intended) was the lack of friendliness from the bartender who actually made me uncomfortable. I think it's safe to say he does not love his job."}
{"text":"This BWW looks and feels similar to any BWW in the US. There are plenty of TVs for game watching. If you're in Canada and want to watch American Football, this is the place to be. The menu is similar but a little more pricey. Our server and other staff we encountered were very friendly."}
{"text":"This place will always be great to me.  The service is slow sometimes.  Who cares.  It's chicken. The bartenders, especially on Fridays, are awesome.  It is sometimes very loud in here, but it's a sports bar.  Deal with it.   Bathrooms aren't 5 star, but once again you are in a sports bar.  Come here, enjoy the sports, find some good food you like, and drink some of their always well chilled beer."}
{"text":"First impression was not good. We were here before lunch hour (11:40am). My husbands chair was dirty and the first menu I picked up was dirty and sticky. They no longer do refills in the limeaid and lemonade. It used to be bottomless and you could even switch flavors. If they were losing money on the deal,we would happily pay a couple bucks more for the drink to keep the free refills and I am sure we are not the only ones!!!  My daughter did try one of the drinks the blueberry mint lemonade and she said it was absolutely delicious but it was maybe 5 ounces of actual drink and the rest was ice.  The drink was very pretty with a very nice presentation.   We were here on boneless wing Thursday so the prices on wings were more than reasonable, 70 cents per wing. My husband and daughter both ordered various wings and I got an appetizer sampler as well as the pretzels because a coworker raved about the pretzels.   When the wings came out one of my daughters choices, lemon pepper, had obviously caused difficulties for the kitchen.  It appeared as though the cap fell off of the lemon pepper and the small dish was filled on one side with a good three ounces of seasoning in the side of the container.  Very strange. The food was ok. I loved the pretzels.  The combo plate was just ok. But aside from the dry pile of seasoning in one of my daughters wing things the wings were generally very good.  All in all I give this 3 and a half stars.  The server did well except she did not tell us her name so I can't compliment her on here and there was a paper on the table when we sat down that said hi my name is Brandon and I will be your server. That was obviously left from the night before.  Which explains why the chair and menus were not clean!!  We will come back as my family loves the wings and all of the sports on the TVs."}
{"text":"I used to love buffalo wild and came here twice a week... but tonight will be the last time. I tried to call ahead for pickup but was put on hold for 15 minutes. After 5 minutes I decided to start driving there and I actually got there before Kim remembered to pick the phone up. There were 2 people at the counter... bad service and that's really disappointing because I love the wings... but the entire point is convenience after a 13 hour work day. Service is bad at this location in comparison to the one on Las Vegas Blvd... just go there instead"}
{"text":"I just noticed I've been coming here for about 2 years and have not written one review. The place is great, the atmosphere is nice, the staff is friendly, and the food is all very good.  I've ordered pretty much everything on the menu and the fried cheese curds are the #1 thing I would always get. However lately me and my girlfriend have been ordering the sampler because it's big enough for two. For dinner the boneless wings are a must-have, but if you're not in the mood for chicken with spinach artichoke dip Pizza is to die for. I never thought bar food tastes so good.   Buffalo Wild Wings is definitely a great place to come and relax after a long days work. Big 5 stars for this location"}
{"text":"I actually love this place for pre-game chatting and beers. For the last Cards home game of the season, we headed back here because the food ok, the service good and for the tons of TVs and the crowd. We loved that they label the TVs with what game their showing so you know where to sit to get the best view. Sweet!   We arrived probably right about 10:15 a.m. High tops were available so we grabbed a good viewing spot. We quickly ordered and perused the menu. Tons of stuff, but once again we settled on the tablegate platter. So huge the two of us didn't finish it.  We both had bloody Mary's and our server was great about telling us they were spicy. I can handle spicy so I ordered it and it was good. Our server explained that I could order it \"dirty\" but that it added more of a kick, so I declined.  It came with the usual celery and there were pickles added.  New twist, I thought.   Food came out quickly and frankly it's bar food. I'm ok with that. It's game day so whatever. The best part of our THREE HOURS there was the wonderful server we had, Kristy. She was quick, friendly and I felt she took good care of us. When a group of guys asked if we were leaving and if they could steal the two chairs we were not using it's like she swooped in a protected us and said we didn't have to leave because of them. Believe me, we were about to move because someone wanted our seats!  She was very sweet and as corny as is sounds, I felt like we made a friend.    So go to BWW for pre-game fun, loud fans and cold beers. Sit in the open space and track down Kristy. She'll take good, good care of you."}
{"text":"The service was average. The place was not busy on a Wednesday night and the waiter was serving multiple tables. It was a little slow but I guess that was the reason. I ordered wings and they came cold but I did not complain. I have been here several times before. I just don't get my hopes up coming here. I know the food will be decent but that's about it."}
{"text":"Haley, the girl with the dark brown curlyish hair is awesome. She always gets my drink right away and is not pushy. Order is always correct, food is incredible for wings. You can tell she is hardworking and friendly."}
{"text":"Took the bar and the bartender took drinks plus food order. Fast service but not pushy at all. As always at Bdubs lots of TV's around all showing sports. I'm trying out the lunch menu specials for the first time. It has variety of options at very reasonable prices. All in all pretty I'm extremely happy with the service, food and the cleanliness."}
{"text":"We sat in the bar and I liked the setup and the service was good. Food ordered was carrabien jerk, spicy garlic, triyaki wings which were all fine.  Overall decent place for wings and beer. Personally I like the All star setup and food better which is in Vaughan."}
{"text":"Worse location ever! Do not come here if you like to order your wings crispy. We waiting 50 minutes for some soggy ass wings.  Server told us it would take 30 minutes which we were perfectly okay with. And honestly, I wouldn't have complained if my wings came out crispy but they weren't. We spoke to the manager and decided to leave. She was no help besides giving us a BS excuse and told us crispy wings only take 12 minutes which made us even more confused.   Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"We waited for over 40 mins for the wings when there were only a few people there. The wings tastes ok. Neither great nor bad. The price is 60 cents per wing on Tuesdays, which is pretty good. Prepare to wait longer than you expected."}
{"text":"While I understand that this establishment caters to sports fans, having the tv's so loud that you can't hear the person across from you in the booth talk is too much while you're in the dining room. I ordered the chicken street tacos, and I was disappointed in what I was brought. My tacos were drowned in the spicy ranch dressing , I didn't see a sprig of cilantro, the Pico de Gaillo was missing and my food was too spicy. The waitress asked if I liked my food and I said I didn't and she asked if I wanted to exchange it for something else. I selected the chicken quesadilla, which was actually pretty good, but when we got the bill both of the items were on it! To top it all off, she never came by with refills for our water and she clearly knew  that I thought the tacos were extremely spicy. Save yourself your hearing and your money by not eating at this overpriced chain."}
{"text":"I decided to order takeout and my first online order was to receive a discount that the cashier forgot to apply. She advised me to get it \"next time\". I ordered a 20-count boneless wing with various dressings. Every last one of them was horrible!  Cold, chewy, meat droppings, each with an undistinguished coating, is the best description I can give them. A 20 piece McNugget from McDonald's would have been much better."}
{"text":"Got an order of 18 bone less for take out...three different flavors - spicy garlic, caribbean jerk, and asian zing...not enough sauce on any of them...carrots and celery must be in short supply as well...  I have no idea why people like this place or how they start in business actually...must be good marketing"}
{"text":"By far the worst service ever, besides the manager being incompetent and not knowing how to asses the situation and know how to manager the room he rather have a bunch of upset customers who are they to watch their team play, he has the sound and tv on games that no fans are their. Then the waitress brought the wrong order. Over all they all looked like chickens with their heads cut off. I've never ever not left a tip but this is one time I will not."}
{"text":"My sister was in town and her friends suggested we all meet at Buffalo Wild Wings. I've never been to this location before but wow, what an epic fail. Our waiter Carlos was clueless. From when we ordered our food, it took 40 minutes before it arrived. The restaurant was not that busy, there were empty tables available and it was relatively early in the evening, we met at 530 pm. By the time we finished it was 745, what a complete waste of time. There went the rest of our evening. Not once did he check on us nor tell us why the wait was so long. It was like he forgot about us. I have a feeling he did because when we got our food, it was cold. Carlos is a big detriment to your establishment. I certainly will be hesitant to go back to this location or any Buffalo Wild Wing locations."}
{"text":"Service was fine.  The staff are clearly trained on upselling and offer to add-on everything they sell to your order.  The sauce was great, the wings were terrible.  I ordered 18 wings and got only 1 leg.  Everyone knows the legs are the best, so this is intentional.  I'm sure they'd be willing to give me more legs for a fee.  The wings also had very little meat on them.  The positives were friendly service and fun atmosphere.  I'd go back for beers or to buy sauce, but not wings."}
{"text":"Tuesday May 2nd at 6 PM.  We all had cravings for wings.  I really love their happy hour appetizers, $4 Fried mushrooms and mozzarella sticks.  Also I will never go back to Hooters ever again.  I have never had wings this big before.  The same chart lies, if you're not into spicy food, don't get them tossed.  I chose a mild parmesan garlic sauce on mine and by the end of the meal I was on fire.  It was delicious though!"}
{"text":"Okay now I am mad.  I did not review this place when it first opened, because my first experience was horrible and I felt bad because they just opened.  I did not review it the second time because it was busy and I felt bad.  I am reviewing it now because I ordered a small to go order FOR THE SUPER BOWL (a event that a wing place opened for several months now should have been more than prepared for) is STILL NOT READY.  I ordered at 6:20p.  The young lady on the phone told me no problem, it will be done in an hour.  I was ok with this wait.  My boyfriend left at 7:20 to pick up the food (5 min from my apartment) and is still there waiting.  Why? Because they felt that they shouldn't put the order in until the guest arrived for their pick up???   Let me get this straight.  Ordered an hour before pick up.  Order not put in until 7:30.  Its now 9pm and I still have no clue why my small order of wings are not ready. Our Super Bowl night is ruined.    You had ONE JOB Buffalo Wild Wings.  No wonder why everyone hates this location.  Your management stinks.    If I could give this place 0 stars I would.   Oh, and the first two times I ate here I sat at the bar.  My food was 40 minutes late because they served it to someone else both times. No one knew how this could have possibly happened."}
{"text":"Didn't get food got drinks and Kloee was the best. Very very huge crowd due to the St.Patrick's Day event and she check on us often and made sure we was ok. She deserve a round of applause"}
{"text":"First time I went there I was not happy. I decided to giver it another try last night - MISTAKE!  Got seated promptly and was informed my server would be there shortly (can't remember the name we were given). About 5-6 minutes later a different waitress shows up and asks if we had been helped. Since we had not she said she would take care of us. She then impressed us (party of 5) by remembering all our order even with the couple of special requests.   She brought our drinks, minus one sweet tea - said it was brewing and would be out shortly, which it was.  45 minutes later... I track down a \"Captain\" and explain we are hungry, cold, and tired of waiting. He stops playing with his phone and talking to the security guard long enough to tell he me he'll check on it.  2 minutes later - runner is parading a tray full of what looks to be our food around the restaurant. Sure enough, it was indeed our food which is now ICE COLD. It felt like it had been sitting under an A/C vent (did I mention how cold it was in this location). Oh heck no - I had it. I told him this was unacceptable and demanded to see the manager. Our waitress came back and asked what was wrong - we handed her some of the food and she confirmed - ICE COLD. She left to get the manager. Manager comes out - asks what's wrong. OMG! I made him stick his finger in my plate to see how cold it was. He apologized, said he would replace it and of course not make us pay for it.  So I guess to ensure it is hot, every order (party of 5, remember) comes out individually as it is finished. First my wife's, then her sisters, then her husband's and then mine - I mean come on, its not rocket surgery here. Oh, and we never got silverware and napkins - not even with the initial order. I asked for them TWICE, and only got them after my wife's second plate was delivered.  This place was stocked with servers - must have been 12 of them. I guess they had no kitchen this night, but it doesn't matter to me because I WILL NEVER GO BACK!"}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings just has to get it together... I really try to give some businesses the benefit of doubt when I see how low the star ratings are, however I believe that if several people who don't know each other all have the same experience it's not them it's YOU! Whether it's management or not I just don't know where to start or who I should be giving some constructive coaching to. The most recent experience I had earlier this week with my co-workers was just meh. For starters we were quoted a wait time for a table that ended up in fact actually doubling. Once we were seated one of the team leads/shift managers came over to introduce himself and another server which whom he explained would also be helping him. That wasn't the case though because we never saw her again until after he left. When it came to getting drinks ordered we all browsed through the menu of cocktails and I decided on one of their \"top shelf\" long islands. Now I am a long island drinker and so is my co-worker who actually ordered the same thing. When our drinks arrived I could already tell that my drink was not made how it was suppose to be. The color of a long island shouldn't look like water with a hint of brown. Anyways we sipped our drinks and of course all you could taste was the sour mix. I brought this to the attention of the server and even asked is this a pre-made mix drink or an actual hand made pour from the bartender. He replied \"No it's made fresh\" I beg to differ.. I know the difference, I sent it back with no desire to order anything else from the bar because it was evident whoever was working that night didn't know what they were doing. When the drink situation was solved and we moved on to our food order now that's when I felt things would be better. After our tables wings were dropped off I again noticed that another request wasn't fulfilled which was to have my wings tossed in extra sauce, they brought out just extra sauce and pretty much said pour it on it's the same thing. Already annoyed I was like whatever about the whole meal and ready to just go. When the bill came again there was an issue there because the manager who at first was our server who now was off didn't properly promo our wings for the Tuesday wing special smh. Get me outta here I won't be back.. I'll stick to the Warm Springs/Durango location or Hualapai in my area.. You would think with this location being so close to the strip that the service would be tip top and not as spotty..."}
{"text":"You never can go wrong with a local Buffalo Wild Wings! This past Sunday was my first time at this particular location and I must say that it was a great experience! Originally went to the casino to watch the football games and due to the over crowdedness we headed up here! Greeted promptly when we walked in but headed straight to the bar where there were plenty seats! The bartenders were all very pleasant and professional! Good came out very fast and fresh which is always a plus! But then again how long do traditional wings and it boneless really take? You can tell that there are plenty locals that come here on the regular because there were plenty people greeted by names by the bartenders! Will return again!"}
{"text":"Who knew Buffalo Wild Wings had Happy hours at 4:00 AM?! Not me! Boy I'm sure glad my co workers introduced me to this late night/early morning happy hour! After a long and entertaining night at the club we decided to stumble into this place hungry! The menu has plenty of things to order off of as well as the regular main menu is available! We ordered Large wings split with the different sauces, fried pickles, mozzarella sticks, etc you name it we ordered it! Our server/bartender was awesome and was very attentive which is important for people who are kind of drunk and hungry! Will I be back after a fun night like this?? Absolutely you better believe it!"}
{"text":"Where to start out with this review.  It has been a while since we visited, but still need to share this.  To start, the place was packed as it was the NBA playoffs.  The place was absolutely freezing and I do not get cold very easy.  We spoke with the manager about the issue and he stated he had contacted corporate, but they had not sent someone out to fix the AC.  After ordering the drinks, my mother received her wine in a glass which was hot, but at least clean.    We ordered our food and surprise, stuff came out wrong.  The fries we ordered for the table came out lukewarm at best.  When brought up to the manager, he stated he was surprised since they came out of a 170* fryer (or whatever temp he quoted us). Eventually the fries went back and came out piping hot the next time they were dropped off.  The salad was asked to have the dressing on the side, but it was on the salad.  When explained to the manager, he asked us to taste the \"dressing\" to see what it was.  Instead of fixing the issue, he decided to keep talking about it for way too long.  He finally took the salad back and when it came out, the salad had a complete different chicken on it, but at least the dressing was on the side.  The salad did take way too long to come back out as well.  When we ordered the wings, we had requested ranch on the side, which didn't come out until we asked another couple times for it.  We were surprised about this when the bill came and we were charged for the ranch.  Lastly, the manager was not very kind before he actually took it back.  He was trying to place the blame on us that the food was cold and the salad was made wrong.  He should've taken responsibility for it right then instead of taking forever to take back the food and get it corrected.  Needless to say, this was the worst BWW and we will certainly not be going back to this one."}
{"text":"Since the remodel prices have gone up and expect people to pay $4 for 16oz can unreal"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go to eat with family. The service and food is awesome. The people who work there are friendly and always accommodating. We love to watch sports games there."}
{"text":"Mango habanero sauce was the business! Watched the NFL draft & Cavs/Bulls game here while visiting Vegas [again]. It wasn't crowded at all, our server was great.  I really wish they'd open one in San Diego; it would fare very well considering we love sports bars out here."}
{"text":"My cousins, their friend, and I went here for a late dinner around 9pm on New Years Eve. We were expecting it to be crowded, but it was empty, which was good for us because we were hungry and didn't want to have to wait too long for our food to come out (as I'd experienced other times when the restaurant was busy).  Anyways, we ordered Mini Corn Dogs, 8 Boneless Wings with Asian Zing sauce, and 24 Traditional Wings with half covered in Medium sauce and the other half covered in Asian Zing sauce. Here is a breakdown of the food we ordered:  Mini Corn Dogs- Yummy. The cornbread coating was crunchy yet soft on the inside while the hotdog was hot. The accompanying spicy mustard sauce was good too. My cousin noticed that the recipe changed, saying that the new recipe was better as the cornbread coating was less doughy than before.   Boneless Wings- More meat than Traditional Wings, but a little more expensive. I enjoyed the crispy coating and the moist white meat inside, but I did find the coating a little too salty.    Traditional Wings- Mini drumsticks and wings deep-fried to perfection. I found some of the wings to be too fatty, but at least the meat wasn't dried out or tough. I also preferred the drumsticks to the wings because there was more meat to eat. I am in love with the Asian Zing sauce. It's the perfect blend of spicy and sweet, and matches so well with the fried wings. The Medium sauce was too salty in my opinion.   Celery- Yay for negative calories! I wish some of the celery pieces had been cleaned more thoroughly to remove the hard-to-remove dirt spots. Also, some of the pieces of celery didn't seem fresh as they weren't as crunchy as I like my celery to be.   Overall, we had an enjoyable time at this Buffalo Wild Wings eating, talking, and watching sports on the big screen TVs. Usually it's too loud to have a decent conversation at Buffalo Wild Wings, but this night proved different."}
{"text":"I am only rating this particular experience. But my boyfriend and I come here one a week or so maybe once every two weeks. U remember roman use to be our regular bartender but he had left, such a shame because he was great!  Instead these new bartenders, Michelle was her name, are incredibly rude, does not care about the guests that sit at the bar. The first thing that she screamed for was for our id and then took a 180 and walked away. Who does that?! I had to play 20$ of poker before she even acknowledged us to get our drinks and food. After that she doesn't even check on how our food was or if we needed anything else?! Isn't that your job description?! Again I loved this place when roman was here I don't think I will be a regular anymore. I would rather go out of my way a little to go to the one on north 5th."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!!! This place is horrible, my family and I went to this Buffalo Wild Wings and first of all the service was terrible. We were looking for the restrooms and the staff was just standing there laughing & looking at us. When the waitress came over I asked what was so funny and she said because we knew y'all was looking for the restroom. We ordered our food and the food wasn't right plus the food was horrible!!! Nachos were dry and didn't have anything on them but they were supposedly to ultimate nachos. (NOT) none of us enjoyed our food. This location is uptown and it was EMPTY now I know why!! This place is horrible. We won't be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible head to toe! Service 0 food 0 cleanliness 0  Servers are untrained kids and the food is greasy. Not recommended at all. The bathrooms smell like piss. Manager lazy walking around not checking on on guests. Good job driving this location down the hill."}
{"text":"In the interest of cheap wings, my boyfriend and I decided to visit the Buffalo Wild Wings on their $0.60 wing Thursdays. That was our first mistake.   We got to the restaurant at about 3:00pm, and it was completely deserted. this wasn't a bad thing, but it was kind of eerie in such a large sports bar. We were hoping to take advantage of happy hour drink specials, but their happy hour does not start until 4:00pm.   Consisting of 27 wings in 3 different flavors and an order of fries, it took about 15 minutes for our order to arrive. These were the nastiest wings I had ever seen; they appeared to be deep fried and then sparingly slathered with different types of sauce. The sauce-to-wing distribution was inconsistent ans stingy. Some of the sauce even appeared to be congealed because it was improperly heated.   The fries were just as disappointing as the wings. They cost $3.69 and were smaller than the portion size available at In-n-Out Burger (not as delicious as INO might I add).   The total for our 27 wings, one order of fries and two waters was around $30. Now I can think of many restaurants that I would have preferred over Buffalo Wild Wings that serve much better food similar pricing. This negative experience was exacerbated by the fact that we came here because it was cheap.   TL;DR: Don't eat here if you have any sense of dignity."}
{"text":"Why is it that every time I am here, I end up leaving about 10 lbs heavier?! I guess I am a sucker for some good wings! The wings here are great. You can even order them boneless! And with so many sauce options and only so much room in my stomach, I always find it hard to choose. I always find myself going with the Spicy Garlic, Caribbean Jerk and Mango Habanero.....can't go wrong with any of them. Of course if I don't \"feel like chicken tonight\", the Popcorn Shrimp and Chili Con Queso are always winners.  I have been to several BWW out here and this location is my favorite. Bartenders are great and always provide the best service. Sundays during football season are the best here. Great crowd and food....you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"It was food, that's the best I can say. The restaurant had a funky smell my wife described as \"like a day care center\". The service was OK but the food was blah and I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"We come here after baseball on Thursdays as a team.  It is a fairly good location although I have heard that the one in the north surprisingly is better.  On Thursdays when we go they have their boneless wings on special for 75 cents a piece.  I don't know how this is a deal because it doesn't seem that cheap compared to when you can go to a wing knighted get wings for like 10 cents, 25 cents or 40 cents each. I need to find out how much they are regularly because for 10 it is $7.50.  They got a 4 star rating because their server that we had wasn't very friendly."}
{"text":"The only thing going for this place is the amount of TVs they have. This is the 3rd time we've been here and it's terrible. The service is beyond awful. Our waitress had to be tracked down every time we needed something. She never cleared out table in a timely matter from dirty plates/cups. The table next to us had to go take their check and form of payment to her after tracking her down for the check to begin with. She wasn't the only waitress like that either. Rather go to Zipps. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is the WORST headass place ever worst customer service and worst food. bye"}
{"text":"Had good experience at other Buffalo Wild Wings, but had a really bad experience with a  rude and nasty woman staff. She cannot be more impolite. No matter how you like about a place's wings, this staff is simply driving any customers away. Avoid if you can."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always a nice treat. Lunch is around 8-10 dollars and the staff is great.   The sauces are excellent  and the food comes hot to the table.   I love the honey bbq the most.  The wings come traditional,  with bone or boneless.  The  fries are yummy and the  side salad is fresh.   Hey, get over there. They are waiting for you."}
{"text":"I like my wings BWW (drake voice). .  . Ok this place is awesome!  Servers always nice and foods always great!  I only do boneless mango habenero and hot!  I also get down and dirty with the jerk mon! And never forget cajun fries with queso on the side.. for the drive home! Why are you still reading ? Get you some!"}
{"text":"Fail! Tuesday  night and we couldn't  get service  at the bar! Management was to busy shooting  the breeze than to help the one bartender.    The red hair manager  even looked  me in the eye and ignore us awhile  longer.  I had to ask for  menus  and then she left, didn't  even  tell us what's on tap!  Never  going back!"}
{"text":"I usually like BWW but this place was bad. Pretty empty when we got there at 8pm, a couple of 8-10 people groups came in and there was still plenty of room. First sign of trouble, \"I'll have a ... IPA, draft\", comes back in a bit \"we are out of that\", \"I'll have the Dogfish 60 IPA\" (a pretty standard IPA), comes back in a bit \"we are out of that, how about a Stone IPA\", \"Sure\" I say, comes back in a bit \"we are out of that\", WTF? My wife orders coffee, \"we are out of creamer, we do have milk\", OK, whatever. Put in a order for wings, pretty simple, it's in their name, it took 1/2 an hour for them to show up. They would stop by every 5-10 minutes to see if we wanted a beer refill, no thanks, I'll finish my food and get out of here."}
{"text":"Unlike my other Cleveland BWW review, this place was nice. Parking was a bit tight but there was plenty of room inside. We asked to get a specific baseball game on the TV and they were able to get that done pretty quick. We had Beer and Wings and they both came out fast and tasty, overall a nice BWW"}
{"text":"I've been to Buffalo Wild Wings at multiple locations and while others may have issues, I haven't had anything bad to say. I usually get a seat at the bar and watch sports on the TV's around the area. They usually have some nice options of beers on draft and the service has always been great. I usually get 1 or 2 orders of wings and enjoy the different flavors. I did get their \"Mango Habanero\" once, thinking \"mango is sweet\" but it was way too hot/spicy (which makes sense since it's the 3rd from the top of their \"hot\" meter) and I didn't finish them but my other choices have all been tasty."}
{"text":"If I could give this Zero stars I would ! I attended this location this past Saturday (01/27/18) with a few friends of mine around 2am. When we sat at the bar to order the server by the name of ED approached my party extremely aggressive and asked us if we were ordering drinks. We hesitated  for a bit just looking of the menu and he rudely shouted at us \"IS ANYONE ORDERING DRINKS !\" we brushed the incessant odd and proceeded to place our food orders with him. When he got done to a friend of mine in the party who wasn't quite Sure what he wanted ED stated out loud to hi  \"GUESS NOT\" before storming off!! At this time my party and I decided we were going to sit there and be treated that way and went to leave ! At that moment ED ran up behind us belligerently telling us we had to pay our bill (mind you we hadn't received our food and didn't order any drinks!). When we told him we we didn't appreciate the way he was treating us and we weren't going to pay he attacked us verbally telling us to \"GET THE FUCK OUT! YOU'RE ALL 86'd\" !! I have never in my life been treated this way by someone in the restaurant business! So we decided to speak to the manager who wasn't apologetic or empathetic to our situation and seemed to see now problem with the way ED was treating the customers !! Even other customers who witnessed the ordeal were on our side and told the manager that ED had been rude all night to not only us but to all the customers in the restaurant!! I'm truly disheartened and disgusted with this establishment and the way this situation was handled ! I'll never eat at Buffalo Wild Wings Again !!"}
{"text":"Generally good servers and food. However the late night option has become less and less helpful. They close the non-bar area too soon and force people who want late night food to sit where the people are drinking and shouting and swearing and ranting on around the bar.  It's tiresome and dumb. I used to like going here late at night but this is becoming less and less enjoyable."}
{"text":"Waitress not attentive at all. Ordered large wings with mild sauce, they came out cold with very little sauce on the middle and almost none anywhere else on the basket. Very dissatisfied with this experience"}
{"text":"BWW at this location has been super yummy the way I prefer my wings. I order strictly the flats in honey bbq.  The combination of the crispy chicken skin and the sweet, savory sauce and the tender chicken meat is phenomenal!  This business is clean, welcoming and wonderful with their service. We enjoyed our waitress, but didn't get her name, she's super cute too.  However, I am not a fan of the LOUD music it takes away from your dining experience when you are having a conversation with those in your party. I enjoy the music, it's just waaay too loud the two times I have been and I think the prices are high too. My traditional wings for 10 pieces were $10.99 and it doesn't come with any sides other than a few carrot and celery sticks.  If you like traditional wings they have a special on Tuesdays (I don't know the price) and on Thursdays they have .60 cent boneless wings, so 10 pieces is $6.00 compared to my $10.99! A significant savings, but at the regular price perhaps offering sides with it would be ideal and appreciated. I still like this place! :)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. After a recent visit, it's been a complete 180 NEGATIVE experience. Pending review, I have made a request for corporate to contact me regarding valid concerns. Clearly during my last experience the staff and management just don't care about anything. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. As a vegetarian I was excited that they had black bean burgers. BEWARE.  We brought the food home and instead of a black bean burger, imagine my surprise..IT WAS BEEF! They gave us a black and blue burger instead of black bean. When I called to report the error the response was , \"wow, I'm sorry\". S my question is what would happen if I had an allergy to shellfish and ordered chicken strips and was given popcorn shrimp?  Their prices are not cheep, portions were small and incorrect. DON\"T GO! SAVE YOUR MONEY!"}
{"text":"Best Wings Ever.  Loud sports bar atmosphere, great for kids, variety in wing flavors is crazy, if you don't like wings or wing sauce or sports you should go somewhere else.  This one seems to be managed well.  Only downside was eating there after my seahawks lost the superbowl...."}
{"text":"Great wings, lost of choices, you better like a sports bar feeling. Lots of tv and that trivia game thing.  Love this place, don't eat here much only because I'm always on a diet....."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings serves up great wings and bar food and you can't go wrong with them if you're craving wings. Having tried them, I've now tried all the major wing franchises here in the GTA and can say Buffalo wild wings is probably the best of the bunch (I'm no wing fanatic though).  I liked how you could split sauces at no extra cost with their wings so I had half in a chipotle dry finish, and the other half in a spicy BBQ sauce. Their wings were excellent, it wasn't too breaded (like wild wings) but yet aren't as skimpy as St. Louis'. I really liked the dried wings. We went with the Tex Mex loaded chips as an appetizer; it was awesome and not what I expected at all. Fresh crispy potato chips, with cheesy sauce, tomatoes, and some chicken. Nachos it was not but it was still oddly satisfying.   Do keep in their mind that the spicyness levels here are more spicy than you would assume, so kick it one notch lower than you would normally eat.   They have great lunch specials where if the food doesn't come within 15 minutes, it is free (food came in at 14:40 on the clock if you're wondering!). Service was fantastic, screens are everywhere, there's little to complain about, so good job to this location and Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love the place and the atmosphere. We had a guest captain today and she offered to bring 6 sauces to the table for ha to sample. We had the Caribbean jerk- it was ok, spicy garlic- was a good one, Jammin jalapeño-spicy/tangy., Thai curry- tasted like Ramen noodles, mango habanero-Loved the sweet spicy! It hits you,try it and Sirraacha- Spicy! Remember everyone's taste buds are different so ask for a guest captain and sample some sauces!  They charge $.60ea for celery and ranch,which don't get me wrong is fine but I didn't know. Tuesdays is traditional wings day which are only $.50 Thursday are boneless wings and not sure how much! To end it, place is good, staff is great, food is freaking delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!  It was not crowded on our visit.  Our waitress suck so bad, forgot what we ordered, gave the wrong food, and did not bring our blue cheese.   She was not available when we needed her and did not come and check on us.  The topper was that we tipped less than 10% but when we review our bank statement on-line- the waitress added more to it!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been coming in once a week for lunch and sitting with Daniel at the bar. He really knows how to make you feel welcome and like a main priority in your visit! Such a warm smile and always ready for a beer or wing sauce suggestion! Felicia has also made our experiences great every visit we've had. Great food, legendary service, and awesome times! You've earned yourselves two new regulars due to these two individuals!"}
{"text":"I love wings. I know this place is a chain so what can you expect? I couldn't believe what I was seeing, the floors were filthy and none of the hosts or serving staff that were around (it wasnt a busy night) bothered to clean the floors or pick up the straw wrappers, food, and napkins that were all over the floor. It was pretty bad... Also lesson learned - don't try and be daring and order something other than wings here. I decided to get the app sampler, the buffalo mac and cheese (some of the pieces of chicken separated from the breading and it was a mini dried up piece of chicken inside) and we tried the pulled pork sandwich and fries as well. Overpriced, lack of flavor and possibly microwaved meals. My server didnt give me silverware (to eat my mac and cheese) so I had to wait 10-15 minutes until I even saw her again to flag her down to ask for a fork. No facial expression of Oh man I forgot it or im sorry or anything like that... i feel bad even leaving this as I was a server in the past but I think management and customers should be aware."}
{"text":"Niko recognized us as soon as we walked in and kept us company while we waited for take out and made all sorts of suggestions and offered us drinks while we waited. LOVE coming to this location and being welcomed like old friends"}
{"text":"Look, it's a wing place so don't expect the moon. Good beer selection and the number/orientation of TVs is exactly what I'd expect from a sports bar. Not all sauces are good so when in doubt stick with mango habanero. Service was fine at this location however I came pretty early in the day. I'm a fan of the concept but wouldn't come to a bdubs on a busy  night without realistic expectations of less than stellar service."}
{"text":"My favorite place for wings.  Every one of their 15+ or so sauces looks delicious, unfortunately I fell in love with four flavors and just can't bring myself to try anything else!  The WIld is the 2nd hottest sauce they have and isn't a tripe dog dare type of hot, but packs a punch for those of us who love really hot stuff!   Honey BBQ is my wife's favorite and my 2nd favorite behind the Hot/Wild.  It is the perfect mix of sweet and bbq and the chicken is always cooked perfectly.  The pick up service is always fast and they are always friendly.  I go there to pick up wings before almost every Bears game during the NFL season.  It's the best!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Went back again as really craving wings!  My faith has been restored. Good service, checked up on us just the right amount of times, the yummy wings and ice cold beer were just what I was looking for.   Meh.  We came in Wednesday, service was less than stellar. Asked to sample new sauces, our 'captain' completely forgot about us but our waitress did too so I guess all is good. While ordering, another patron approached and said I want to leave what do I owe, he was clearly upset and said he had been waiting on his final check. I started the stopwatch on my phone in plain view so when we were finally given our final bill 30 minutes later we got the excuse 'oh I had to close out a large draft party'. Really it's 9:30 on a WEDNESDAY there is no one freaking here and we saw you so engrossed in washing glasses you weren't helping anyone. Whatever! If it weren't for the wings we would never return."}
{"text":"It's reopened!! New ownership! :) Granted, I was at \"B-Dubs\" once or twice before new ownership made its way, I am glad it's open again. It gives us, Surpris-ians, the ones stranded out in Surprise, AZ, another option for eating and drinking.  Service still \"meh.\" Sometimes, the waiters and waitresses hit it out of the ballpark amazing. Other days, the service can be slow. I can't complain too much because they gave our group free shots while we were waiting for our food to sample. This bribery I'm ashamed to say tends to win me over sometimes.   Food is consistently good. The latest creations that I've tried are the Margarita wings and the Salted Caramel flavors. As one can imagine, low and behold, the margarita wings do taste like you've drank a margarita. Sorry, no buzz to be found, but the sweetness and saltiness definitely are familiar tastes. Same goes for the salted caramel. My friends gasped at the idea of me trying the salted caramel, screaming, \"No, salted caramel belongs with dessert not chicken wings.\" Of course, I'd try it if someone tells me it's wrong. Survey says, \"not bad.\" It's definitely worth a try. It still tastes barbecue and hickory accented, but there's just a bit of caramel poured into the sauce so a hint of sweet hits your palette. Not overwhelming at all.  Last night, I took the ghost pepper wings, a large order of 20, home for my hubby to try. I was not trying to ruin his day, honestly. He loves spiciness and can hang with the toughest. He housed all 20 wings with no problem, even when the restaurant servers forgot to put ranch dressing in our to-go bag. Blast them for forgetting the ranch! It goes hand in hand like peanut butter and jelly! He said the wings were very hot and tasted good. Most of the time when foods are too spicy, you can't enjoy the flavor, but he said in this case, you could still have great flavor. He's uncertain whether if the wings were one of the spiciest he's ever had because he said it didn't have quite enough sauce. I guess we are going to have to go back and try again or you'll just have to find out for yourself."}
{"text":"A great spot to hang out. Its better than the other BWW i've been to, and i've been to a lot of them! Great bartenders during the week but the 2 girls who work on the weekend or nights just don't cut it. They're to slow and leave you sitting there twittling your thumbs waiting for service.  Besides that this place is great!  I love just hanging out watching the games over beer and wings.  Spicy Garlic!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hot damn!!! Great service, delicious menu. Definitely coming back. Thanks to Gloria. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This is a famous chain, so my review is more about this particular place around Robinson, PA. Our waitress Sarah was too busy with other stuff, and not attending to us at all. She didn't even repeat water, forget other beverages and food. We wanted to place more order but were disappointed with her behaviour. We were more put off as this is not the first time. We usually go after 10:30, as this is one of the few places open till late, and we mostly see her. We know at the waiting desk itself how our experience is going to be when we see it is she attending us. And nothing unusual that night, where she just didn't come back after putting our orders on our tables once. We had to request someone else for water and check. I usually don't write such nasty reviews, but this is more like a complaint against that particular waitress and not the chain. We still enjoy the food and the beer and the environment and the gentry that comes to this place. Please hire better waitresses/atleast manage them better. Hope this review is taken into consideration."}
{"text":"I live really close to this location and my boyfriend and i go to this location at least twice a month (im always craving their asian zing wings!) The girls who take phone orders and to go orders are always nice. I hate giving bad reviews so I'll take off just 1 star because this isn't a big deal (mind you that i use to have problems at this location all the time.. one time we waited 20 mins after being seated to be greeted by someone, we actually had to ask. another time i found a peice of paper on my meal that had just been brought out to me.. but since that was 2 years ago and accidents happen I got over it and plus, I didnt yelp back then so theres no proof of it lol.) But this time I ordered wings and for the sides i chose celery sticks and ONLY celery sticks. However i got carrots and celery which im happy because the celery sticks they had given me were old. They were brown on both sides which hey, i can cut the ends out myself right? Well i mean they could too. Not a big deal because I paid for wings and the veggies are more complimentary, but, this is just a reminder to go the extra step and to fix the problem right then and there because you never know who might yelp and post a picture on here. I'm happy they got the *celery sticks only * part wrong because i ended up eating the carrots and tossing the celery."}
{"text":"I live in Richmond, Virginia and I had went to vacation to Pittsburg, PA. I was telling everyone how good that Buffalo Wild Wings is so of course I had to show everyone what it was about. I wish there was more restaurants around because they are so good. I always get the same thing, medium boneless and medium sauce, everything was perfect about the service and cleanliness but I would have to say that they should put more sauce on the wings because dry wings aren't that good. And for the people that don't like that much sauce should be asked by waiters how much sauce that they want. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I think my time with BWW has come to an end.   Boneless Wing Thursdays used to be a weekly group outing years back. We would to order food and drink as we played trivia for a few hours. That gradually dropped off as our favorite locations began to close up. So this year when I received a birthday coupon for a free snack size order of wings I thought why not give it a try again?   Unfortunately, this is a franchised location and I was informed the coupon would not be accepted. That was disappointing. But since we were already there and bordering on hangry, we decided to stay and order food anyway...my mistake.   Not sure if I just can't handle an overload of fried food anymore or if I legitimately got a bad batch but my system is not pleased with me and I regret the visit.   The menu has changed with a lot of additional options beside just wings and potato wedges (my old standby order). Also, Buzztime Trivia has been upgraded to new tablet consoles. This initially seemed great, but then the consoles froze while we were trying to play a second round of games. Super frustrating.   Overall not a great experience and probably my last visit to a BWW."}
{"text":"Went in to get some wings and beer and that was good. I put 10 dollars in the jukebox and played a whole list of rock music. My first song came on and then I noticed a food server putting money in the jukebox and picking songs. After my first song, country music came on for almost 45 minutes. The server paid the extra 25 cents to play over all of my songs and by the time I was walking out, my songs were coming back on. Screw this place just for that reason, is going to go to distill next time"}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful. You know when you're pretty drunk, everything tastes AMAZING! You think about it the next morning and maybe you go back sober and you're like, \"okay.. Maybe it's not as good as I thought, but it's still good.\" This is not the place to think that. Even in my drunken stupor after a Panthers game I found this to be the worst Bdubs I've ever been to. The wings were so disgusting I couldn't even eat them."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I called my order in, went to pick it up 15 mins later. Meal was cold, Togo server was very unpleasant. I asked for Togo sauce after paying my order. It literally took 8 mins before receiving my sauce. A party of 6 was patiently waiting to be seated. No welcome, the family decided to seat there self's."}
{"text":"I love BWW! This one was lacking any cushioned seats in the whole building. The food was very good, the service was a mediocre B-. The atmosphere was nice enough. I asked for my wing sauce to be mixed, and was told that it was not possible when I know that every other BWW is able to. I had any empty glass twice. Overall I was not impressed but satisfied."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this Buffalo Wild Wings location and I am never going back. The service was the worst I have ever experienced at any restaurant. When I asked the server about an explanation about the happy hour menu, she told me to look at the menu myself and waited there impatiently until I ordered. I asked if I could get half and half flavors for my wings, and she said yes so I ordered two different flavors - the lemon pepper and mango habernero, and my husband ordered two flavors too for his medium sized order of wings. We ended up getting four full orders of chicken wings! My husband and I could not finish 60 chicken wings between the two of us, but we felt bad because it was prepared already. Another server noticed we did not want it and agreed to take the chicken wings and come back with what we originally had ordered. My husband and I snacked on the appetizer for half an hour until a different server finally served us the food again. Again, they messed up our order and gave us two entirely different flavors that we did not order. We didn't want to complain again because if we were to do so, we were scared they might do something to our food because of how much we complained thus far. At this point, I didn't even want to eat and I just wanted to pay and go home. Our original sever finally comes back after an hour and asks us what's wrong in a rude tone, and I was so close to walking out. This was my first time complaining about shit service because they first over charged me, then attempted to make up for it by giving me the wrong orders??? I still tipped and payed, but this place is not worth anyone's money."}
{"text":"Placed a large order with my coworkers and everything was perfect! No missed orders, and everyone's order was correct! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food? Meh. Service? Blah. Ambience? Cheesy.  Its a typical sports bar, nothing to write home about. The cheeseburger (yes, I know, not their specialty) was greasy, half the fries were hard and small, and the service was slow. The manager was cool and made her way over to introduce herself, which was nice. Looking around the room youll find the typical framed jersies, including some of Scottsdale's high schools. The floor is carpeted, which I hate in restaurants. There was a waitress walking around sweeping the carpet, so they do make an effort to keep the place nice n clean. One thing BBW needs to do is cater to ALL sports fans. Of allllllll the TV's in there, only one had a hockey game on, and it was behind me. Every few minutes I would crane my neck around to check the score, as not many waitresses were around to change channels for us. All they had on was lame college football. zzzzzzzzzz"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. It took 15 minutes for the first beer to get to the table (restaurant was not busy) and they told us that they were out of the rest of the beers. We asked for another type and guess what... They were out of it too. When I spoke with the general manager he basically told me that it wasn't their fault. I'm sorry but if you are going to earn my business at least own up when you are in the wrong. It ended with the GM saying \"it won't bother us if you don't come back and don't threaten me like that.\" It wasn't a threat but however this is a Yelp review sooooo...  Good luck in the future, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the closest one to us which our default location...service is ok, usually our order gets messed up...but food is always good! Love the beer selection too!"}
{"text":"I hate this BBW location...only because they have the worst service ever! Hosts take almost 15 minutes to get your names. And most of the time servers take 20 mins to even come greet you and get drink orders. Even the bar was always a hassle.  All the stars is cause our recent server Bryant. He constantly checks up on his tables and makes sure everyone got everything. He's the go to guy at this location, will always try to look for him! Bryant deserves 5 stars but the location still sucks."}
{"text":"You will never have worse service anywhere else. Every time I've been there the servers have been rude & totally incompetent. One time a friend I was with asked for a new fork cause the one at the table was dirty, & our server rolled her eyes & snatched the dirty one away! This place is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Mango Habanero was on hit, but service sucked ass!  A bunch of workers standing around and empty tables, yet it took forever for us to get seated, orders taken, refills, food, and our bill!  They are open 24 hours though!  I'll give them another try the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Took over 45 minutes to get our food and we only ordered wedges and boneless wings. Food was cold when it came to the table. Place is understaffed."}
{"text":"We should not be waiting for food for an hour. Other locations are not this bad. Not coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The manager Danny is on some sort of power trip and ysuara is a super annoying bitch not much else to say came here in a good mood some how left in a better mood knowing I dont have to work there"}
{"text":"I would have probably given this 2 3 star for its food. I am not a big fan of wings, specially in all the flavors it sells. But that would be a general comment for all BWW. But this branch specifically, I have bad experience with. During serving, they dropped chicken with spice on my t shirt and pant, making both of them unusable. Which aggravates me more is that, no one even apologized for their mistake nor replace the chicken. I had to eat the partially empty bowl of chicken. Not only that, they were going to charge even for the chicken they dropped. Only when we reminded them, they dropped chicken on me, they decided not to include the price of dropped chicken.   Anyways, a decent apology would have sufficed."}
{"text":"We normally love BWW but this location always seems to have a problem getting the right amount of sauce on the wings. One time, they will have very little sauce and the next time the wings will be drenched (which is ok with me!).   The last time we ordered take-out from this location (I really mean the last time!) we got home and noticed they forgot to put any sauce on our 2 orders of wings.   Even though it's closer, we are no longer frequenting this location. The Las Vegas Blvd. location is much more consistent (and quieter)."}
{"text":"In the grand scheme of things, this B-Dubs fails to separate itself from its other locations.  The food, drinks, and plethora of television sets are all standard for B-Dubs -- nothing out of the ordinary. I thought the atmosphere and layout were both better than the Akron location but worse than the Oxford location. The exterior makes the place look run down, but it's really not. It's kinda unorganized in the interior, which is what I don't like about it.  Other than that, you know what to expect from a big chain such as this -- horrible ads, college-aged workers, and good food and drinks with above-average prices. Come here if you're looking to stay with what you're already familiar with."}
{"text":"The food here is alright. Never really was a big fan of BBW, but my cousin wanted to eat here because of the wing special they have on Thursdays, 60cents for boneless wings. It's a little too pricey for boneless wings I must say. I had the parmesan garlic wings and the chicken 'burlitos', which basically was a soft chicken taco. I don't recommend the parmesan garlic wings, it's wayyyy too saucy and the chicken burlitos was a disappointment.   The only good thing about this place is that there's plenty of TV's to watch any sports game."}
{"text":"They have a new policy in effect as of OCT 2016 for 1/2 price wing Tues. No Special requests ( i.e. All flats, all drums, fried hard, not crispy, etc.) I decline. If I want my wing the way I want them I'm not compromising even if they are 1/2 off."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Went here a week ago with some friends around 1 am and sat in a booth along the wall. Not a minute after our food arrived a roach crawled across our table through my food from the wall. I screamed with a serious phobia of bugs and jumped up and say on another table. I got the waitress who got the manager right away. The manager came to talk with us and just as she did the roach came back and \"BAM\" she stepped on it and motioned the waitress back over. She asked if I wanted new food because the roach had gone on my food but my appetite had gone and I was very pale and felt like I was going to pass out or throw up. She didn't offer a voucher for next time or a gift card. She comped our meals but it didn't mean much because I didn't really get to eat at all. It was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a food establishment and would recommend steering clear of this play until they get sprayed or something."}
{"text":"This isn't really a review for Buffalo Wild Wings so much as it is for this location.  I've always liked going to BWW but the service at this one has always been so slow.  I'm about 0 for 4 and decided thats enough tries.  The first time they brough me out raw chicken wings.  The chicken was still transparent and not even warm.  It seems like I'm always waiting around forever for my drinks here.    Again just want to say that I do like BWW but this location needs to pick it up a little bit before I go back.  I don't doubt that it can happen."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. I would not recommend this location at all. The waitress who served us seemed to be absent minded the whole time we were there. The appetizer came out last, after our entrees were served. Tonight wasn't busy, so I really don't get why the service was not up to par."}
{"text":"We went back here about 3 months ago. Service and food were, as always, good to go. But the new layout still remains, and it still sucks. And seriously, the booths are so freaking deep, an average person needs a pillow behind them to get them to the table. I don't think we'll be going back here anymore, for us, it's just not a comfortable dining experience. Which is a bummer, cause I lover their Caribbean Jerk. We'd order as take out, but we live about 25 minutes from them so it's not a real option."}
{"text":"We usually only come on Tuesdays or Thursdays for the specials! You can't beat the happy hour menu. The service always seems to be on point. Make sure you join the rewards program we always get free appetizers!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Buffalo Wild Wings and the nicest thing I can say is they have great commercials.  I won't give it a 1 because their onion rings were good and one of the wing choices I made was good.   Bottom line, if you're in the mood for wings I suggest going to Wings and Things."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is generally a three star restaurant but I give an extra star on this occasion because of an honorable mention. Our server, Marlena, was probably the best server I've had anywhere! She went above and beyond. Great job Marlena!"}
{"text":"What a complete and utter disappointment!  My husband and I went their today for a late lunch, and by late I'm talking about 3pm, so we completely missed the lunch rush.  The place was not at all busy and we sat at a table in the half empty bar.  We sat there for 10-15 minutes and no one came over to take our drink orders, give us menus, or even acknowledge our presence.  We didn't even get an \"I'll be right with you.\"  After waiting for as long as we did and still thirsty and starving, we got up to leave.  On the way out I mentioned to the hostess who thanked us for coming that we were never even served.  She said she would tell a manager, but who knows if that happened.  Afterwards, we drove to Hooters and got excellent service and were served immediately.  The Buffalo wild wing server lost out on a big tip.  Next time serve your customers."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this location quite a few times, and every single time the servers are great and the food is always wonderful.  This time was a bit different. I was trying to win something out of the prize machine, and I won one toy, but I wanted another. I tried again, had the toy in my claw, and then BAM-- it dropped, much to my sadness.  We sat down at our table and the manager surprised me with a free toy due to all my extra effort.  The staff is wonderful and so is the food."}
{"text":"Just bad customer service, everything else is what you expect from a standard buffalo wild wings."}
{"text":"We had not been to a BWW since 2012 on the road from Colorado heading into Nebraska, on a long trip. That experience had been a good one, and I had to go out for wings last night. My husband was game, so we headed to the BWW on Hualapai. Recently a wings place, which shall remain nameless, STOPPED selling traditional side dishes we liked. They STOPPED and so we STOPPED taking out their food, though their WINGS are fine, but STOP messing with our sides. I mean, seriously: STOP! We were seated immediately at BWW. The parking lot was full and the place was hopping! Families, kids, and seniors like us.  Server was johnny on the spot at our table, knowledgeable and friendly. Savannah had our drinks (a tall, very good Hefeweisen and a pretty good IPA from Washington state) and some roasted mushrooms, which turned out to be fried. I recommend that the pieces of mushroom actually contain more mushroom than just batter pieces without mushroom, but they worked enough in there that you could at least get 7 real mushrooms in the entree for almost $7. my husband had a spicy sauce with bone in wings and I went for the Thai ginger which is amazing on my grilled chicken. Give me an attentive server PLUS a manager who checks in naturally and with a welcoming manner. Thank you, Aaron! Staff were numerous and the crowd seems satisfied.  This was a very good experience."}
{"text":"The service is great. Unless you come on a game night. Or your friend asks the waitress for her phone number.  The food is fab. And by \"food\" I mean wings. Nothing else counts. That's why I can't really dock them for having shrunken, misshapen potato wedges, watery coleslaw, bare bones ribs or tasteless nacho chips. It's a wing joint. It would be like docking points from a pizza joint for having a dried up hamburger. Check the sign, buddy. If it says \"Buffalo Wild Wings\", then chances are that's the only safe food to eat.  The atmosphere is dull and lifeless. Unless there's a game going on. And then there's too much atmosphere. If you're lucky the screams and cheers of the other diners will drown out the fact that your food is like a half an hour late and your sprite needs a refill.  The price is appalling. Unless it's a Wing Tuesday or Boneless Thursday. In which case it's only semi-appalling, if you have no bones with paying extra for a cup of ranch or bleu cheese. Look, not to be a pain in the ass, but you have vats of them in the back. Maybe if you had a little man sitting there in the back heaving and hoeing to pump that artery-clogging goodness in its tiny plastic cups, then I wouldn't mind so much. But I shouldn't have to pay an extra 50 cents because you can't afford to offer 40 cent wings or 50 cent legs three times a week. Take a fucking economics class, you bum."}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wild Wings because of one thing. I always get the Buffalo dry rub traditional wings. If you like crispy wings and no mess which I don't you, need to try them. The only thing that is the downside to this place is it can get pricey when you are with a lot of people are ordering a lot of food in this case that would be my only drawback to eating here often."}
{"text":"Blah!!! Skip the walking taco. Every item on the Taco Bell menu is better than this disaster."}
{"text":"Pretty high up in the ratings on the corporate chicken wing ladder.  The service was actually very good, although there were only about 4-5 tables full in this cavernous place. The wings were good, I guess it is just their standard method, but a couple small plates wouldn't hurt to eat over.  Price can get a little high when you are basically just ordering appetizers."}
{"text":"In love with their happy hour menu. Great special deal for wings on Tuesday . Great location with larger room & open seats . Depend on the hour it does get crazy crowed & a bit wait of time for food , do not come when ur super hungry at their rush hour, especially game night. Over all great server & well done on food."}
{"text":"We've always had great servers that are friendly and attentive here! Atmosphere is loud enough to bring a noisy toddler. It's a chain so the food is pretty consistent here. Would I hour of my way Togo here? Probably not, but overall it's decent bar food."}
{"text":"I like this BWW location. I've been here many times and it's always been great. They will put whatever game you are interested on a tv if one is available. Food is good, sometimes a bit salty for my taste but that's all BWW."}
{"text":"Worst.Service.Ever. I realize that bartenders are not servers. I understand it is not in their job title. Foodtender...does not have the same flow right. But if you are going to serve food at your bar (that you are tending) one would assume that you kind of have an idea how the process goes. I waited for over 45 minutes for our order, was served the wrong beer twice. ( I ordered Newcastle, recieved BUD LIGHT?! then a bottle of Corona...) i finally gave up and drank the damn Corona. After I reminded her 3 times about our order, she brought it. cold. and with no silverware. Excellent!! She was rude in addition to being incapable of performing her job. Enjoy the 10% tip sweetheart, you were lucky to get it."}
{"text":"I waited 25 minutes for my drink. Horrible service. Bad & worst experience at a Bdubs."}
{"text":"I live in North Las Vegas but this is my location of choice. The food is always prepared great no matter the day of the week and the service is always awesome. I would like to single out one employee in particular, her name is Kamryn. She is fantastic (and deserves a raise management!!) she always remembers my name and my order when I pick up to go. Great over all and thanks for always being awesome Kamryn!!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the one in Strongsville with my Drama Class at Tri-C, but since I live closer to Brooklyn...I had their wings! They're actually tasty, but I will say this...I won't eat anything with habanero peppers again...ouch!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch, happy hour, UFC, and late night. Wings are always delicious. Getting sauce on the side is the way I go.  That way I get to try as many different sauces as I want. Spicy garlic, mango habanero, and Asian zing are my favorites. Don't like wings? Try true burgers. Actually, don't go to bww because you suck if you don't like wings. I said it. You. You suck all you non wing loving people out there!! BWW is good. When they do all you can eat wings, game over man!! Game over!! Love love love it!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  I'm a fan of their 8 wing lunch special.  Wings, fries, and veggies.  This is also our go to spot for Champion's League games.  They show every single match!!    Unless you've been hiding under a rock all these years, you've been to a BWW location SOMEWHERE on this planet.  You know it is all about the wings.  My personal favorites are mango habanero (which I think is way hotter than the blazin), Asian zing, and thai curry.    There are a good variety of beers on tap, something for everyone I would say.  The food is always fresh, servers friendly, and always a fun time.  Only problem is that, depending on the sporting event, it gets way too crowded.  But that is part of the fun, you have massive crowds cheering for both teams.  Almost feels as if you're in the stadium."}
{"text":"NOT AMAZING. 1 bartender trying to serve entire bar while the ASU/ Syracuse Basketball game is on. Also trying to clean and keep up on dirty and putting away clean glasses. Now Sitting next to pissed off customer waiting on his order bartender keeps ignoring him knowing because informed order would be out in 3 minutes that was 7 minutes ago. Nice staffing BWW... **( Update just got my bill and this review is based on principal. Tried to get beer from bartender from 6:51 to 7pm unable to get her attention until came over to corner of bar at 7:01.(of course came over after Happy Hour) Just assumed she would give happy hour price do to ignored me, nope I was wrong.  Not about the money here just nice when a bar or bartender does the right thing. Do to the awful service tonight she could have given Comp beer knowing she had no help behind the bar do to poor staffing.."}
{"text":"The wings were okay but certainly not good enough for a place with the name of the food in the name of the restaurant. The service the 2 times I've been here is friendly but super super S L O W.  I like the atmosphere... TV's everywhere... very family friendly... but I don't like the smell in the restaurant/ bar and I don't care for the S L O W service."}
{"text":"Arrived on Sunday to have lunch and it took more than 30 minutes to get our food. When the food arrived I was sitting with an empty glass of tea and my wife with an empty glass of water. We asked for silverware and only received one set, while waiting for the second set we touched our food to find it cold. The chicken on the sandwich was cold and the bun hard, our fries were cold and hard as well. The manager came over as requested and apologized, she also refreshed our drinks. After finishing our meals we decided to hang around and enjoy the games and atmosphere. Unfortunately, the service  continued to be very slow. Not an experience that I hope to repeat."}
{"text":"Service is so slow. I've gone twice and it gets worse and worse... Never coming back again."}
{"text":"So I typically check into a place, and maybe leave a quick tip.  My experience tonight has inspired me to FINALLY write a review.  This is not a good thing.  For me to take the time to write a full review takes some serious impression upon me from the restaurant.  In this case, the impression was so piss poor I couldn't help but come home and sit down directly to cyber-lambast our evening's activity.  This Buffalo Wild Wings has been closed for over a year, and I honestly think they should either A) hire a competent staff with a great manager or B) close their doors again because they clearly have no idea what they are doing as a team.    To begin, we are a party of 6, well 5 1/2 since the baby doesn't count as fully human yet.  We were told that a booth that seats 6 would open up momentarily and would we mind a brief wait.  No sweat.  I like sitting on my husband's lap, but NOT at dinner in a restaurant.  After sitting for a few we were told to follow the host.  He sat us down at a small booth that literally squished me up against my husband and the baby's car seat.  When I questioned \"Is this the booth for 6?  It's awfully small.\" The host said, \"No this seats 4, but you could wait if you want for the large booth.\"  I thought we had made that choice already, but I suppose ignoring your customer's preference is ok. The host said he could bring a car seat sling since we were squashed.  Having 3 older hungry children I acquiesced to his offer.  Our server appeared promptly, and she was very upbeat.  OK, things were getting better.  She took our drink orders and gave individualized attention to the children which was great.  My husband ordered a beer, we all ordered sodas.  She returned with the sodas and said the beer was on the way.  She took our appetizer order and the meal order.  She asked if we would like the appetizer before the entree and we said yes. The beer still hadn't arrived.  When she checked in a few mins later the beer STILL hadn't found it's way to the table.  She personally grabbed it from the bar.  As my husband took the first sip he noted that the beer was skunked.  (bad flavor, sat out and got warm and then was re-chilled).  he mentioned this to the server and she stated \"Oh yea we have some issues with beer at the bar getting bad.  Happens a lot.\"  Really????  So at this point the entrees come to the table.  Where is the appetizer??  No one knows.  Also the carrot/celery order magically changed into 4 orders of celery.  The server says she will check with the kitchen about the status of the appetizer and grab some carrots as well.  We just started eating our food because we were hungry.  Now the food was good.  I can't complain about the wings at all.  The kids liked their kids meals.  The portions were good.  This was the ONLY saving grace of the evening.  The server comes back with carrots and says the appetizer is coming.  We keep eating and notice there are no extra napkins.  With chicken wings you sorta need napkins...wings are messy.  We are messy. Our fingers and faces are messy.  It's hard to feed a squirmy 9 month old and try not to get the hot sauces on our fingers mixed with the not hot food she's eating.    The appetizer still is MIA.  At this point all the kids are done eating.  I am full.  I am requesting a box.  My husband is done eating.  He asks for a non-skunked beer.  The beer comes and the appetizer is STILL not there.  The server says \"Do you want the kitchen to just box up the appetizer?\"  The nice lady I am says outloud \"Yea I guess so.\"  The furious b***h inside me says silently \"You can tell the kitchen to shove the appetizer up their A$$\"  So we get an appetizer in a box well after the entree to go home with.  We ordered a sampler platter (onion rings, mozzarella sticks, nachos, and some wings) none of which is too tasty after getting cold and spending a night in a fridge.    We pay our full bill...not even a sorry was offered.  I honestly didn't even feel like paying the $12 for the platter but I was just too disappointed to say anything.  We rarely go out to eat since we are a large family.  Spending $100 for dinner just isn't always in our budget.  I didn't want to mar the evening for the kids by complaining.  They thought everything was terrific, so I let them maintain that belief.    When I got home I opened the sampler platter just to see what was in there....the three sauces were in the box with no lids and the sauces had managed to spill on everything and mix together.  I now have a bunch of snacks swimming in a melange of ranch, cheese sauce, and marinara....not my idea of a flavor explosion.    We don't eat out often, and it's experiences like these that keep me from wanting to go dine out.  I know it's a chain and not Chez Robertfancypants, but I expect my appetizers at the table before the meal and most certainly not in a box after the meal has been eaten.  Sorry Wild Wings.....we gave you a shot, but I don't think I want to drop $100 again.  Ever."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the mango habanero wings. Mango might make you think of mango flavoring but all of it is a lie. It's really fire flavor. Very spicy."}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich which they forgot to put sauce on and then charged me for a side of sauce. Brought me a different sauce I didn't even ask for and charged me for it. This place is so corporate. I won't return!"}
{"text":"This place has turned into a s**t show particularly when using take out. Soooo late and beyond what they say it will take. Beyond disappointed..."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Buffalo Wild Wings we've been to. Food was very below average, we had to send the fried pickles back because they were too salty and soggy. The wings weren't spicy at all and we got the Caribbean and desert heat. Our waitress didn't seem like a people person. We'll get our wings somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Fight night and they are seating family style which is fine, but when we get 2 different rounds of people and the 3 girls in the booth next to us that the manager keeps flirting with get none it's super annoying."}
{"text":"Attempted to place a to go order and over the phone he said they were so busy it would take 45 to hour wait for food. We drive there, the parking lot www empty and there were no customers in the building!"}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings food had great customer service by our server Adam. He made our visit great especially coming from California and visiting this area. Thanks Adam."}
{"text":"My very last review. Promise. We have since moved out of the Boro and now have a BW3 near us.  The new one we moved near is so much better! Why? Happy hour beer is $2.50 and wine- $3.25 as opposed to 7.50 a glass anytime of the day. What a joke. Even if the Boro is individually owned, the price of their alcohol is absurd.  I am appalled by the variance in price. BTW, if the manager or owner of the Boro location gave a rats behind, they would post a response. Will they? Doubtful."}
{"text":"Listen. Just moved here from another zip code in the immediate area. Drinks are almost half the price of the bw3 we go to AND the service is waaayyy better. How does a chain restaurant vary that much in price? Its almost half of what we were paying in our old zip code not more than 30 min from here. Falling in love with Bw3 - again - after many years."}
{"text":"By far the best hot wings in the world! I am willing to drive from El Centro, CA to Las Vegas (5hrs)  just for these hot wings,  its that good! The service is great, they have a full bar and the best thing about it its open 24-7. how awesome is that :)"}
{"text":"So far so good our waitress has given us decent service so far! All is well with the family not too busy actually sort of quite today! Normally it's a packed house so it was a nice change, we usually come later around 7:00pm, but this time we came around 5:30th just right! Here's the piping hot appetizers gotta go! Yum! Thanks Karli!"}
{"text":"Despite having a large group, the service here has been absolutely terrible! We had maybe 15 people, but regardless, the server would drop a drink and run away, without asking is anyone needed anything. It took more than 20 minutes for a sprite to come out. I've asked for a water twice, to no avail. If you don't have time to spend, don't waste your time. Or order to go."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Buffalo Wild Wings. This is a good location to stop in and watch the game and enjoy a tall beer. They also have wing specials pretty regularly. My go-to here is the hot BBQ and a side of wedges with lemon pepper always hit the spot. Service is pretty good here and the bar usually has plenty of open seating. Beer Wings Sports Yum."}
{"text":"It's Buffalo Wild Wings. I don't have super high expectations when eating it, but compared to some of the BWW I've gone to in the past, this one does a great job ensuring my meal is right every time. I've never eaten at this location but I've gotten take out a few times and they open every box of wings at the register upon pickup to catch any mistakes in your order before you leave (there's never been a problem with my order).  I can't vouch for the service of the restaurant itself, but the food is decently and wings are priced well (especially boneless on Thursdays.)"}
{"text":"Why is it that every time I go into this joint, it's like Amateur Hour at The Apollo? I am so over going into joints, and leaving feeling like I was taken in a weird slight of hand game.   This place is so over-rated. How does one order off of the Happy Hour menu, and leave with a $70 bill. For 2.5? Me, GF, and 5 yr old.   We went here for a great fun time with cool peeps, and were there 2 hours. Wing Tuesday is really not that good of a deal, and the Happy Hour beers are junk.   Sorry for the rant, but, Buffalo Wild Wings, I am over you, and we need to end our tepid relationship."}
{"text":"Went for the Machida - Jones fight on 12/10. The line-up card was awesome. If the service was as good as the fight card, we would have dropped a 20 on her. Unfortunately it was not. She came out of the gate like a Thoroughbred, and finished like a Donkey.   Our server came to the table a total 4 times without asking us if we needed anything. (We shared a table with a couple of others due to the crowding of the place.) If ever there was an opportunity to make money for a server, this is one of those nights.  However, water glasses remained empty, even though our server was at the table 4 times to the tune that I needed to ask a different server for more water. I was prepared to drink several beers during the fight, but due to the hassle decided that drinking beer at home would be easier.   The toughest part was watching this server stand at the hostess stand and bullshit with her co-workers during the majority of our time there. Her lack of attention had nothing to do with the place being packed, and working her ass off. She had decided that it was more important to bullshit with her co-workers.   As the fight was winding down, my gf and I were sitting at the table talking, and I noticed our server staring at us. AWKWARD. I almost wanted to tell her to go away, but instead, removed the tip that I felt almost obligated to leave. And shortly after, we left.   Let's talk about the check.... $32 for 2 beers, and 24 boneless wings. Yeah. Sticker shock. Shitty service, and overpriced food.  I don't stiff servers often, if ever before... But tonight, I did. I admit it. Call me a douche. I've just made the decision that I refuse to put up with shitty service from people who feel entitled to make money for no effort. If we're talking about entitlement,  I am now entitled to tip a shitty server nothing if I deem it appropriate.   What a horrendous dining and service experience."}
{"text":"Here to watch UFC 200 on one of their large plentiful TVs. This experience was much better than my last visit. Crystal, our server, was great! She kept our drinks full and made sure our food came out correctly.   The food tasted good and came in a timely manner. The Naked Tenders were surprisingly juicy and not dry like I feared they would be. The order had 5 medium-sized pieces. I tried the Carribean Jerk sauce but will go for something spicier next time. My friends really enjoyed their Big Jack Daddy burger and Bacon Cheeseburger.    This is definitely the place to go for UFC PPV events!"}
{"text":"Very slow service. Stale food. Waited a hour to get cold food. Couldn't finish after few bites. Someone probably forget our order and made excuses. Restaurant was not even that busy at 2 in the afternoon on Wednesday. I don't see why would they serve this bad quality food. Next time I will have to rethink before walking into a Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Ive been here a million times and this place never disappoints! Sometimes the service is slow if they are busy but they keep your drinks full, they have a million TVs and the game to keep you entertained until your food arrives. the atmosphere is great for game watching and having a large group of people, never have to worry about being too loud or disrupting others. I'm obsessed with the mango habanero but they have a flavor for everyone."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly however it took over 40 minutes to get our food. We ordered a salad and a wrap. When we asked the server if our food was coming any time soon he responded with \"I think there is 3 tickets in front of yours. Food is being really slow tonight.\" Ok... Maybe we should fix the problem in the kitchen. If there are 3 tickets in front of ours, you're telling me that I have to wait close to an hour to get my food. We won't be coming to this location again."}
{"text":"I have not been to BW's in a long time (so long it used to be Buffalo Wild Wings and Weck).  This location was selected for my fantasy football draft (my team sucks btw).  The location was larger than I thought.   The place was clean and the server very attentive.  I was pleasantly surprised that they had a buy 1 get one free special going on.   The server recommended I change my order to the smaller size since I could double up.    I saved a little money.  The place was clean and atmosphere was good.  Overall, I liked it."}
{"text":"Watched the superbowl here and had a good experience.  It was my first time at this location. Service was great; Well at least our server was on top of it. food was what you would expect coming here; but it came at a reasonable time and was hot.  good place to watch a football game."}
{"text":"So Ive been on a low carb \"lifestyle\" as of the first of the year so options aren't all that plentiful when visiting my friends out in the 'burbs. Fortunately the wings at BWW are fried and not breaded. So for about 3 carbs for every six (less the sauce) you can have a pretty good and satisfying meal. The garlic parmesan (2 carbs per oz of sauce) wings are pretty good with a side of ranch and some celery, perfect!   The service was really friendly but for a bar type place the dining room was packed with kids. Not that I cant stand kids just that with all the beer served it just doesn't seem like a family kind of place, talk about a bad example. Do you really want your kids hanging out in a bar?  Im just glad that there are more low carb options out this way.. though leave the kids at home or take them to Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"I was here on 9/22/17 and my server was Bethany... I ordered wings and the appetizer sampler they were great ... but I also ordered the curd bacon burger..... it was awful there was a spoiled taste to the meat and I told  my server... and she asked so you don't like the burger and I said no the meat is off... she asked again is it the tomato the bacon lettuce or meat.. I said the meat  is spoiled  and she just waled away like it was normal.... it was not removed from my bill... I also got food poisoning ...from the burger...... Never go here!!!!"}
{"text":"Look.. The service is really good.   But here's the kicker, \"Cook the wings LONGER\"!!!! Please adjust the time you normally cook them a few minutes longer. It's just so bad to have a wing hang out of your mouth because the ligaments are still attached to the bone. Come on man..!!!!"}
{"text":"Trendy chain bar: what you would expect  Good potato wedges and alright food... Kind of a scene for people pre 30 year old range in my opinion...   Nothing really bad about it other than noise and just nothing Super exceptional either..."}
{"text":"This is the WORST BW3 in the area. Terrible service and I mean terrible. The only reason to walk in here is to watch UFC, have a flat beer, do not even think about eating anything here. Please listen"}
{"text":"This was my first time back since the remodel.  The inisde looks great!  The service was OK.  The food was NOT good.  Upon being seated we were greeted by the \"Captain\", John, I believe his name was, and then our server.  I asked about Happy Hour which is normally just for people sitting in the bar and we were not sitting in the bar but I am a regular to BWW's sso I asked if they could accommodate which they said they could.  I loved this...until they told us happy hour had ended.  No bueno.  We had drinks which were good, we ordered Mozzerella sticks which were also good, and then the traditional wings came.. they were SO dry and barely any sauce on them.  Our friend got boneless and they were perfectly sauce and had so much flavor!  We didn't complain as it was busy however I did ask for a side of sauce.  I love BWW however I think I will stick to my Eastern location which has GREAT service and GREAT food."}
{"text":"The wing sauce selection is unbeatable. Always have had great food here. Waitress Kat saved an otherwise very poor service rating for this location.  After repeated requests to turn down the unbearable volume of football game. (Pre-season by the way)..finally turned down the sound once I said I would Post on \"Yelp\".  Nobody was watching the game and a total of 15 people in the place.     Thank you Kat  for the always cold beers....and great service."}
{"text":"Happy hour from 2pm -7pm & 10pm-6am Monday through Fri. $3 appetizer/drink specials. We had cocktails, boneless wings & mozzarella sticks. Food was hot, fresh & delicious. Excellent service. Brian was an awesome bartender! May be my new local spot."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. I understand you don't open till 11am but when a customer calls for a Togo order the prober response is I will take the order and place it at 11 when we open not tell the customer we aren't open you will have to call back. I guess they don't value their customers. Way to go!"}
{"text":"When this restaurant first opened it was great but for some reason I feel like it has gone downhill lately      We ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer and it was barely enough to feed one person. The salsa was just poured out of a jar, nothing special at all. It took about 45 minutes to get our food and the restaurant didn't appear busy. When the food finally came out it was just ok. Kinda cold and just blah. Not worth the 49$ bill to feed 3 people. On a positive note they do have really good wings and onion rings! I assume it would be a great place to go to drink, eat wings and watch a game or fight but for a family dinner not so much."}
{"text":"Servers are  rude and have  sex  with  customers.  Robyn talks  about  how she  enjoys licking  her boyfriend's butt. This is disgusting. Shayla cusses. They  over serve; bartenders allow customers  to leave and drive very drunk. Ladies keep  your men out of this place. It is toxic. Food always  comes  cold and  with  mistakes. Much  better  places in town to watch games. Gross!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I usually go in on Friday night. The Girls behind the bar are great. Always a friendly smile."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports on their big screen TV's. Love the teriyaki wings and mild wings. The salads are good too. Last time I was in for a to go order and was waiting awhile and the manager noticed my long wait and actually took action. That's why I will be back!"}
{"text":"Your average BWW. I always sit at the bar when I am traveling by myself and because service is generally better at the bar IMO. The bartender was fast and friendly and made conversation with me. I played the trivia games, ate, and drank. Gotta get the traditional wings with honey bbq of course! Pretty standard BWW experience - although there was an exceptional amount of birthdays that day. Lol"}
{"text":"Average Buffalo Wild Wings with good food. They just redecorated the entire restaurant which made it much more refreshing. I highly recommend thd boneless wings and you cant go wrong with any of their sauces."}
{"text":"If you're dining in the food is fantastic, but I've had about 3 poor take-out experiences in a row. Our apartment is 5 minutes away from this location, and every time we get back to our apartment the wings are lukewarm, and the fries are soggy.  I love b-dubs, but my consistently poor take out experience might send me to the Scottsdale Pavilion location. It seems like some of the other reviewers have had similar experiences..."}
{"text":"As with all other BW3s that we've been recently, the bone in wings are small, overcooked and under sauced. Boneless wings are mostly breading, hard from being overcooked and under sauced. Chips with cheese don't have enough cheese. Tonight we tried a buffalo mac and cheese.  It tasted like mac in a watery milk sauce, with no cheesy flavor.  There were cut up boneless wings on top, overcooked, hard and not easy to eat in the mac.  Garlic bread made with a sandwich bun toasted on one side and buttered with a little garlic flavor.  Not a winning meal.  My hub tried the limited time only maple butter wing sauce which he loved.  I had my usual mild buffalo that I love,  which is the only reason we keep going back.  The service has always been good here in my experience."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of BWW and everything they have to offer. They have a ton of TV's, plenty of seating, good service, and awesome food. Hot wings and beer.......what else do you need.  The thing that sets this location apart is its location. It is located right in the middle of the Westgate area. If you have never been to this part of town, you should go check it out.   If you like hot wings then this is the place for you. Their hot wings sauce is super hot! They do offer samples of their sauces since they have a huge selection, and I would recommend taking advantage of that before you order.  If you are in the mood for a burger then the Big Jack Daddy Burger is hands down the  way to go! Pulled BBQ pork, and onion rings stacked on top of your burger.....GOOD STUFF!!!!   If you are a sports fan, I would for sure recommend you go there to check out a game and hang out with some buddies."}
{"text":"I've been here a fee times over the years.  Each time I've left, I left with a good impression.  This place excels at service.  If our party size is 12 people or 4 people, we have the same impressive service level.  I've had their wings before. They're good. Its in their name so it better be good.  This time, I got their Asian Zing Chicken Salad.  It was good, I especially like the wonton chips that came with it.  I also appreciated the fact that they gave you the sesame dressing on the side and let you control how much you want.  Drinks were filled quickly each and every time.  We actually joked because when were talking to friends the waitress startled everyone.  One second, their drinks were low. The next second their drinks were full!  And the question was \"Where and when did the waitress do this?\"  Clean establishment.  Ample parking.  Excellent service.  Will come Herr again for sure!"}
{"text":"Hate to review after only one visit, I will be going back again to give it a second chance.  This location, like many of their others, have many many TVs, busy atmosphere, and happy people.   First off, I ordered a well whiskey and coke, which wasn't bad, but after that was finished I was asked if I wanted another. I agreed and when it arrived it was a glass nearly twice the size of the first. This would have been awesome had it been the same liquor/soda ratio, but this next drink was nearly all coke...  Ordered the grilled tenders with honey BBQ sauce and a side salad instead of fries. The salad and tenders came at the same time. Can't say that I'd order their side salad again. The chicken was served without the BBQ sauce and without utensils to eat the food with. My friend and I sat there for probably 10 minutes before we caught the waitress again to get silverware and the sauce for the chicken.  The server was very friendly but I paid for the food and service, in which both were unfortunately lacking."}
{"text":"Just received a order thru GrubHub. They did great. My order, not so much. Ordered their chips, extra 60¢, no big deal. What I saw was maybe 20 pieces of undercooked potatoes. Very disappointed. Then I realized I didn't get my Blue cheese, that's sad. And I think they forgot the Parm on my Garlic/Parm wings. But GrubHub did great."}
{"text":"Not my top choice in sports bars, but when you're stranding in Mentor and there's a Browns game on, this place doesn't suck. Here's my take on the bar area, only:   First, TVs are everywhere. I'm surprised they're not on the bar. So, no matter where you sit or how packed it is, you'll be able to see the game. Service? Well, it's pretty good to be honest. On Sundays there's almost always the same people working in the bar, so they know how often to check back for beer refills, etc. The prices are also not too bad, especially if you order the specials.   Food, well, I don't stray far from the wings. I prefer the spicy garlic and hot BBQ flavors and they do them just the way I like 'em. Extra crispy underneath a very saucy exterior--a hard balance to achieve, but somehow they've figured it out. This past visit I also tried the soft pretzels, which seemed better than your average frozen pretzel just warmed up in the oven. They also came with nacho cheese, but not the stuff that comes out of the squeeze container all neon orange. This was actually pretty decent with flecks of tomato and peppers you could see and taste. I was impressed with what I got compared to what I was expecting.   Overall, it's a chain, but the wings are actually pretty good and so is the bar area service. Just do yourself a favor and don't stray from the bar."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 rating for the foodz!   We all have our chain restaurant vices and Buffalo Wild Wings is (one of) mine. Why? Because their wings are damn delicious. Shut up.   I love wings but I hate the way most local bars prepare them. They should be crunchy on the outside, tender inside and have adequate, delicious sauce. Simple? You'd think so. But too many times have I fallen for soggy wings all over CLE. There is only one exception to the crunchy outside/ tender inside rule, and that's Greenhouse Tavern. Because those wings are the best damn wings I've ever, ever, ever had.   Leave it to the wing professionals at a chain restaurant to churn out consistently good wings. I specifically order all flats with medium sauce. And they're perfect every damn time. Oh--and holy crap, have you tried their fries with the salt and vinegar seasoning on them?! This. This, this, this, this. I dream of these wings with a basket of their \"McDonald's-esque\" fries sprinkled with that glorious seasoning.   They also have free trivia that you can pop in on at anytime. And I enjoy that at least one screen always has trivia on so you can passively play while you eat your food.   Other than the delicious items I order every time, there's really nothing too remarkable about anything else here. The service is so-so. Last time we got to listen to the bartender bitching to the other bartender about just BEING there, for like 10 minutes. That's always fun. And I hate all the sports on 98% of all TVs, but it is a sports bar. And this is Cleveland. I've gotten quite used to drowning in constant sports chatter, shows, games--lives revolving around activities with balls (haha.)"}
{"text":"Y'all Suck !! Can't even play the Laker game with sound! It's Kobes last game! Lucky you got 1 star !! Dean you suck! Worse customer service ever you see all the laker fans here!!"}
{"text":"First time at BWW and I guess to sum it up you really can't do much with a chicken wing, bone in or boneless. Boneless is a chicken strip no matter how you decorate it or dip it, and mine was just average. I really don't know how a franchise that has a chicken wing as the \"Big draw\" survives. Won't go outa my way"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's right around the corner from me - always great bar food, cheap, the kids love it and the staff is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I've been to this Buffalo Wild Wings quite a few times as I used to frequent their trivia night a couple years ago. Went here recently with some friends and noticed their menu changed at some point.  As a vegetarian, this is not a place I would typically seek out, but again, the trivia night was the main draw. I used to get their pretzel appetizer, which was three small pretzels with cheese and mustard dips. Now, it is a large pretzel with one large queso dip, like a small soup bowl serving. It was really excessive, but tasty.  The large pretzel is actually better in my opinion as it is softer and definitely enough to share with a few people.  I recommend asking for a side of their bourbon mustard as it also goes well with the pretzel at a minimal upcharge. There is a veggie burger I believe and your standard bar food (mozzarella sticks, onion rings, fries, etc).  Nothing to get too excited about, but enough options for a vegetarian.  Never had any issues with service, but this location does get crowded if you show up around prime dinner time."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like wings? I like this particular location because it's close to everything especially me lol. Dave your friendly neighborhood bartender is outgoing and friendly. we were just ordering some wings to go but ended up having a few brews n appetizers. Still ordered wings to go lol. cool place, lots of screens, friend staff and bomb wings!"}
{"text":"Okay -- this is my last time coming to Buffalo Wild Wings. Been to this location 3 times and others in different cities. They a share one common trait. THE SLOWEST SERVICE AND FOOD DELIVERY OF ANY MODERN RESTAURANT CHAIN. I mean all restaurants have a bad day now and then. But this particular location; 3 times in a row now, I and my sons have been seated and we are then apparently just invisible. Each time, after in excess of 10-15 minutes of sitting dow,n not even an acknowledgement from a server until a return visit to the host asking for service. And then ... the food takes forever! We are one of about 8 tables in play -- convinced that if they were actually busy you might never see your food. Awful --"}
{"text":"Bad food horrible service if your a women and theirs some kind of big event going on. I will NEVER be back here again. I rather go to Apple Bee's and deal with the long wait."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to several valley locations of Buffalo Wild Wings, and this is the only one that has been consistent with service and wings. We often sit in open seating, and sometimes that can be a hit or miss with how quickly you get service, but once we do interact with our server, they're always polite and consistently checking up on us. Warning: Asian Zing and Spicy Garlic are addicting sauces. Last night I tried the new Srirarcha sauce...definitely is going to be addicting (and is only available through early February 2014)!"}
{"text":"This was a life saver.  Went here for a couple drinks with a friend after being disappointed by another bar.  We sat at the bar and were instantly greeted.  Drinks were promptly brought to us.  Katie, the bartender, was awesome.  Very friendly and her drinks are on point.  They kept the drinks flowing quickly the entire time we were there.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I do not know what it is with all of the restaurants on Mall Ring Circle in Henderson, but they all suck!   This is the third time I've been in this BW3, and it keeps getting worse.  My server today (at the bar) was nice enough, but it took 30 minutes to get one order of 8 traditional wings.  And then, they're going to charge me an extra 60 cents for some ranch to dip them in?!  They NEVER have enough staff.  The person I had today was friendly enough, but most of them in there, look like they work in the worst place on earth.  And God forbid you ask for a game on a certain TV (even when it's slow) and they act like it's a chore.  It's a shame, because the location on Warm Springs and Durango is great.  This location could definitely use a refresher course in customer service from them.  I am done with this location.  And I am done with ALL of the restaurants on Mall Ring Circle."}
{"text":"The service was terrible, The way they talk does not respect and do not want to serve, I come to eat pay not for free."}
{"text":"Conveniently next to nascar hall of fame. Great food, great service. Table next to us was complaining about something and manager was quick to fix."}
{"text":"I have had only good experiences here. Good service and food. With drink and dinner you can spend around $80 so that's pricey. Good sports. Soccer sucks and America hates it."}
{"text":"Those wings were garbage. They should probably get new management. They dumped ranch in the bag. Sauce was drizzled on the wings."}
{"text":"Good food good people. This is one of my favorite BWW in the city. Love the service and the drinks!"}
{"text":"We would drop in to the bar occaisionally - but the smell. The first few times you disregard it, but then when it is always there you can't deny it. The bar area smells terrible (have you ever watched Bar Rescue). My mom (a former bartender) went with us once and she recommended that they clean the mats on the floor behind the bar. The next week, the smell was still there and overwhelming, we just turned around and left. We won't go back - not until they get rid of the smell. It ruins the experience - as I'm sure you can imagine."}
{"text":"FIRST LET ME SAY!!!! PLEASE READ THE COMMENTS! I did read the comments before I walked in this establishment and wished I went with my first mind. Yet! Here I am. So the CLEANLINESS of this Place was... It WAS NOT clean!!! Chicken bones on the floor, napkins and trash and dishes on the floor under the table. Secondly, they didn't bring us anything to eat with. So I guess we're suppose to eat like animals. THIRD OF ALL, the chicken was DRY ASF, NO dipping sauce for our DRY ASS chicken. To make it WORSE, the \"Mac & Cheese\"... HAD NO FUCKING CHEESE!!! So with this shit being said, DO NOT BRING YO ASS TO THIS PLACE!!! Unless you just DO NOT give a FUCK about a Fair restaurant experience..."}
{"text":"Terrible customer Service.....  I been in this location twice and twice I sat at the bar and the bartering IGNORE us (me and my boyfriend) we sat NO eye contact, NO hello, NOTHING. I will never going back there is ridicules. But the girl that show up after us he was making sure she was taking care of, we still waiting never look at us, he was drinking his soda never look at us..... HORRIBLE Bartender (ass hole)"}
{"text":"The service is so bad as is the food.  The Manager could care less.  The waitress lost our credit card but delivered the check and never told us.  It took 28 mins to get check and we were late for event.  The food is so bad, the last 2 times I chose to not eat at the Restaurant as the concession food is better at a High School football game.  Avoid!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ehhh, not too bad. 3.5 stars.   It took awhile for a waiter to come to our table once we were seated, but once Patrick showed up, he was very attentive and sweet. The food came out quickly, thanks to him. I loved my strawberry mango margarita... definitely one of the best I've had. We ordered wings, seasoned fries, and mozzarella sticks. Patrick brought us a ton of dipping sauce and consistently checked on us. To be honest, as far as the service goes - it's definitely 5 stars. As far as the food goes, it's 3 stars. I really don't know if I would come back unless I was in the area and had a craving for wings."}
{"text":"Good, greasy, cheap happy hour for hang overs. Order your wings bare and then you can have as many sauces as you want by dipping them into \"samples\""}
{"text":"I love this place. I always come here for the UFC fights. The place is always packed but the key is to come around 430 to beat the crowd. The waiters and waitresses are always awesome and super nice. Food is amazing I always get the build your burger and as well as get the wings to share with some friends. They always have great beer prices as well. And they have a ton of tvs for everyone to watch the fights and games."}
{"text":"Ordered some wings tonight got there and not all of them were ready when we got here so we waited an extra ten minutes for the rest of our wings got home & our wings were cold! Unacceptable! Wings should be hot not cold in temperature! Train your cooks better! This isn't my the first time my wings came like this."}
{"text":"It was a really nice location with good lighting and had good games to watch. Went on a Sunday around noon, no wait, average wait time, and service was good. Good place!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever at this BWW.  Multiple times I've had them screw up orders.  No apology. They make you wait forever and blame customers for their screwups.  The bartender refused to remake a drink for another customer because of his huge ego.  This BWW sucks."}
{"text":"We decided to do take-out, and will never do so again. Ordered two Philly cheesesteak sandwiches which were ok and two chicken wraps which were so small; small portions in large tortillas. Fries were mediocre as was the side salad. The parmesean bread tasted like it was old. Nope, will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I loved their spicy mango habanero wings. They were actually so spicy that I only ate 3. The menu rates the the flavors from mild to hottest, which I appreciate. Nikki H. and I also tried the fried pickles which were delicious. Definitely would get those again.   The only issue I had was that when I attempted to add a little sprinkle salt it dumped out onto my food as though it had no lid at all. I suspect someone accidently put the pepper shaker's lid on the salt shaker. Our waitress offered to replace it. Yay! The manager brought it out and wandered around the dining room, looking awfully confused. When I waved him over he apologized and told me the waitress had told him it was for a child, not a child sized adult.. Not quite so yay, but I'll take it as a compliment.... Btw, I'm 32.. At least the mac and cheese was good!   The menu doesn't indicate how many wings you get, so here it is.   You can get traditional or boneless fried wings. Snack is 5, small is 10, you get the idea. It's all in increments of 5. Your wings do not include a side, which I found a little annoying."}
{"text":"9/14/13 Fight Night. Fire violations, you bet! Bad service! oh yeah! Or, Should I start with the people that brought in patio chairs?? Or....,.(yes, as in camping chairs) OR, better yet....should I begin with the people sitting on the floor in front of one of the entrance doors eating wings picnic style?. I am dead serious people.  There's nothing pretty about what I am about to share.  You can't make this stuff up. It's THAT bad!!  I am still reeling from the experience and I am not sure how much energy I have to go into details.  However, I feel an obligation to share this hair-raising (and just plain awful) adventure. Here's the deal.  I called on Friday to find out if they were playing the fight. \"No, we do not take any reservations. It's first come fist serve.\"  \"So even if I have a big group? \"No, we do not reserve tables at all.\"  What time can I come in and be \"first\" ?  \"Any. Then you are \"first\" come first serve for a table. Great. We got there Sat., 4:45 pm and walked into the non-organized nightmare.  A long line just to get on the list. So as I asked the lady at the pulpit, while my husband stood, committed to the big line, I was told about the list they were making was for the dining room. Where at the time I was standing there, was full and she said would be cleared by 6:00 to start their STADUIM SEATING. The list is how they are seating the room.  Then, goes on, \"But, the bar was open seating, no wait over there, no list. Sit where you want.  Great...My husband got out of the line and we went over to the bar area. Not a great idea. There was 8 or so people scattered about but on every single seating area had these cheezy dirty signs that said, \"RESERVED FOR FIGHT\".  Huh? So, Each employee gave a different story.  \"Contest winners\" , \"People who reserved a table\", \"Overflow from the dining room.\" , \"Gaming customers.\"  We were told not ONE seat was available - ALL SEATS ARE RESERVED. Okay, back to the line. (Yes, the one we got out of).  After telling the 3 girls at the pulpit they were shocked and didn't know this. One even went over to ask. She never came back. We ended up 59 or so on the \"List\" after getting out of line to get back in line. No mercy. They said, \"Oh, don't worry, we are clearing this place out empty.\"  We asked if we could get a drink to wait. Sure. Okay, back to the bar because they told us, \"You wouldn't be able to sit in the dining room unless we were there JUST TO EAT - NOT TO WATCH THE FIGHT. (seriously, I swear this was out of the Managers mouth).  What? Wait. Yes,  I am here to eat... Huh?  Okay, sitting at the (almost empty except for these signs) bar order beers and chat up the girls next to us.  They were not contest winners and didn't make any reservations and they were sitting there. (And ended up sitting there the rest of the night with no hassel).... This is getting long but I swear this happened.... Well, at 6 - They only told 3 or 4 tables in the dining room to get up. People were pissed. They said, \"They are just eating.\" People who walked right in sat down at empty tables that they just told people to get up. And the servers didn't know who sat down where. No contest winners showed-up at the bar. (We asked) But, were told it was going to be \"overflow' that never happened, because after raging and them offering us a bench seat to sit on with 4 other people, (yes, no table, a bench)  we went back to the bar where we had been drinking earlier (and were told to clear out because we followed directions ). We then got gutsy and moved the 'RESERVED FOR FIGHT' sign and had to endure a FIRE DEPT VIOLATION OF TOO MANY PEOPLE. and BABIES on the floor with food and lawn chairs and chaos. There was no way they had any order to the situation! The topper to this is - The girl we sat next to at the bar the rest of the night- Came in to \"reserve\" her place at the bar just by asking the night before. She doesn't gamble. !!  So crazy.  Complete lack of any type of service here. None. No customer service. No organized service. No Managerial service. No communication service. They do not give a flying rip about any type of loyalty or even level F type of  business service. barely a half ass trying. I have never in my life seen such a joke of a place.  Do not go here during an event of any kind. It will turn into a night you wish you stayed home and scrubbed grout instead."}
{"text":"Many flavors of chicken wings under one roof.  from mild to nuclear hot.  Great for a snack, and for late night runs."}
{"text":"This review is for food only!  TERRIBLE!  I know its a chain, but come on!  Don't bother if you have any inkling of eating.  Good if you just want to watch the game and drink beer..."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the bad reviews are about. Was there on Saturday and had a great experience. The wings were great and so was the customer service. Our server Josh was attentive and prompt. Would definitely be back."}
{"text":"I order delivery from here often. But today I was highly unsatisfied. I ordered BONELESS wings and onions rings. Waited almost an hour..What i received was bone in wings and a poor excuse for onion rings. I complained to the delivery service and had a reorder...waited yet another hour and they had sent the exact same thing as the 1st time.."}
{"text":"Your typical Bdubs; wings are usually pretty meaty, service is timely and friendly, and the beer is cold.   Taking a star away due to 2 out of 3 take out orders were either missing an item or was a wrong item. Have never had an issue while dining in"}
{"text":"There's no wonder why Buffalo Wild Wings is struggling to stay afloat, their prices are crazy. You'd expect that for the $16.99 price of an order of medium boneless wings that their portion size would be pretty large, but the actual size of the nuggets has seemingly gone down as the price has gone up. Basically, two orders of medium boneless wings (that weren't that great either. Chicken was a bit tough) and two iced teas was over $50 once you figure in tax and tip. Seems like a lot of money for fried food, a little sauce, and a couple drinks for my son and I. Needless to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"Hot wings and burgers sounded great after a night out, but I was really disappointed.  The bartender took all of our orders correctly (i could tell by the receipt) but every single order came out of the kitchen wrong! Not gonna come back again for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Watching the fight, no cover charge!  Can't get better than that...   Milwaukee can have 20 dollar covers if it's a big name.  BWW in Madtown lets em in for free.  This is the fight spot..  When Anderson Silva gets down in the ring on UFC, or if Pacquiao ever makes that boxing date with Mayweather - I'll be there!  Their fish tacos aren't so bad, either.  Not to mention, the waiter was chill enough to hook our friends up with free beers as a nod to \"the regulars.\"  Can't say I'd ever become that intimate with Buffalo's, but I will certainly join the regulars here on fight nights."}
{"text":"There is only one reason you can catch me here on any given Saturday night: UFC Fight Night.  I love MMA and now that women are throwing down in the ring I'm even more interested.  There is no cover and if you get there around 8:30pm you'll be able to find a decent place to sit.    The place is loud, and they don't turn up the volume for the main event, nor do they switch all of the t.v.'s over because they \"guarantee\" that they'll play any game you come in to see. Right before the big fight the waitress turned one of the big t.v.'s over to a football game, but all we had to do was swivel around on our bar stools and watch the huge screen behind us.    I ordered a veggie boat and it was carrots and celery taken out of the freezer and thrown in a paper holder.  By the time I finished there was water pooled at the bottom from the freezer burn melting off.  Gross.... We also ordered fried mozzarella sticks mid-fight and they were good.    Two stars for free entry to PPV fights and enough room to actually sit down."}
{"text":"If you like wings, sports or beer, this is the place for you! Service was fast and friendly and food was exactly what I expected. This is not gourmet, but I knew that coming in. That's why there are other restaurants, for different occasions. This would be a good place for a large hockey team to come to I'm sure"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place, a standard Buffalo Wild Wings experience out here.  Nothing that could detriment my thoughts of BWW but nothing to improve upon it either.  Still a solid place to come and watch games and enjoy some wings."}
{"text":"Not the best  Not worth the money at all the wings were  Horrible my brothers fries were cold my fiancé wrapped Horrible our food tonight was not good st all"}
{"text":"Food always consistent. Service always excellent. Great place to take the family during sporting events.  My kids love to play the interactive trivia and tabletop computer games. Management always attentive and eager to please."}
{"text":"This place is sadly only rated 2 stars due to me being from Buffalo originally. I have had real buffalo wings and this place doesn't hold up to flavor standards as far as that goes and calls itself \"Buffalo\" wild wings. But for the people who aren't worried about what brand of buffalo sauce is being used (LOL!) they do offer a braod selection of sauces from mild to atomic hot, jamacian jerk, BBQ honey etc. The atmosphere is average bar scene."}
{"text":"Standard BWW fare here, open 24 hours. I shit you not, I had my first real cheeseburger here and did not get sick, so that's saying something.  Good beer selection on tap, standard bar food, good wings. What else is there to say? If you're in the mood for wings, here you are."}
{"text":"Racers start  your engines....  One of the largest BW3's in the land resides in the heart of the NASCAR HOF. This location has a huge outdoor patio section and the interior is massive too with three distinct seating sections.   I have been here a few times since it is just a long walk from the South End. I have had pretty good service here on my visits. The staff was always attentive even during peak hours. The food itself is not the most inspiring but is in line with most chain casual dinning places. The have a long list of wing sauces to cover most of your taste buds. I highly suggest the Asian Zing to try.  What does suck is getting charged for extra sauce when your boneless wings aren't properly covered.  Doing the math,  Beer+Wings+Big TVS+NASCAR history = CHECKER FLAG."}
{"text":"I hate to bring B-Wild down a notch since I formerly owned shares of the company and I totally bought into the hype.  However, I have to say that I was really disappointed.  I place B-Wild in competition with places like TGI Fridays, Chili's and BJ's.  In particular, as a fan of Chili's, I felt like this place should wow me beyond any particular experience at Chili's.  Chili's is decent, but it is a heartless chain... B-Wild is supposed to be the happy, super cool bar and grill that is a chain but gives the Mom and Pop type experience.  First issue was the seating.  I felt as if there were not enough boothes and too many standalone tables.  Perhaps it was a layout issue or even a fire issue, but I think a bar and grill should just have a ton of boothes.  It is more comfortable for beer and wings.  Secondly, the food was just not really up to snuff.  The fries sort of soggie and a little bit cold.  It is a real problem when you are serving shoe-string fries.  The wing sauces were fine (spicy garlic and Asian... actually the Asian one was really good), but I thought the the wings were a little on the tiny side.  Plus, $12.49 for 18 would be okay if the wings were a little bit bigger.  It just did not look impressive sitting in a couple of fry trays either.  The burger meat was okay, but I didn't have the option to have the meat medium and it was a little burnt.  I know I ordered cajun style, but come on!  The buns were good, but were cold.  Finally, the service needed a little work.  The food took a long while to come out (might explain the cold fries).  Then some things were forgotten like the side of blue cheese for the wings and my salad.  Finally, I know that it was kind of slow, but servers were standing around talking to eachother rather than watching the tables.  Maybe it was just an off day... maybe it is better on a game day... maybe I should have had a pitcher of beer...!  I suppose that one should not be so picky about a bar and grill, but I really like the concept and appreciate the corporate management of the company.  So, I hope that they can make some improvements if the issue is systematic.  If it is just this one place, then I hope the manager regulates this location better."}
{"text":"Not a good experience appetizer took 30 minutes and 12 wings was going to take an hour and a half"}
{"text":"The crew at this Buffalo Wild Wings is 100% geared towards customer service. The bar tending staff makes your experience one to remember. I'm kinda sad I don't live in AZ now I'm gonna miss my new friends :) I highly suggest visiting this restaurant when visiting west gate...especially on game days for their specials!!!Spicy garlic wings are the best! 5 star well deserved."}
{"text":"Wish they would quit changing how you order.  First they took away \"trashing\" the wings and now you order different number sets and also have to come up with a time you want them cooked.  Why fix what aint broke?  Food was good and great server Stephanie - thank you."}
{"text":"So, had the weirdest experience here this past Thursday. My coworker and I decided to go get wings for lunch. They have a decent lower-cost lunch menu which works as we are both broke ass poor. We both chose snack size orders of wings with a side. When they brought our orders out, there appeared to be a huge amount of wings, double our order. We brought it to our waiter's attention as we figured we would be charged accordingly. He was a trainee and apparently hit the wrong button on the register. Now this is totally understandable, mistakes happen. The way that it was handled really blew our minds. He brought over a woman who appeared to be his manager/trainer who told us that we would have to pay more if we kept the wings, or we would need to give them back. We had started eating at this point as we had to get back to work. Did I mention that their orders take forever to come out? Anyway, she brought containers for us to pick out wings to give back to her. We were so shocked. I have never heard of a restaurant making a mistake and then asking for the food back. Wouldn't it be logical to say 'oh we made mistake, keep the order, it's on us?' Instead let's throw out the wings. At least I hope that they didn't serve them to someone else."}
{"text":"If there is any food that I am somewhat experienced in, it has to be chicken wings.  I've had them at all of the major chains in Buffalo, NY (Duffs, Anchor, Buzzy's, Sammy's etc) and the GTA. (St. Louis, Duffs, Crown/Anchor, etc)  When I head that Buffalo Wild Wings was coming to the GTA, I was anxious to try them out and have a little taste of Western NY here in the area.  Lets cut to the chase.  The wings at this Argentia location are NOT good at the least.  They were not cooked to how they are in Buffalo or even the USA BWW restaurants.  Personally, St. Louis Bar & Grill or even Kelsey's Wings are better than these.  Try Buffalo Wild WIngs in Niagara Falls, NY.  They are beside the Outlet Mall.  Way better and they live up to their name there.  Not this location.  Even the staff were just moping around looking bored.  Too bad as I had high expectations for another cool wing joint in town.  2 out of 5 at best.  :("}
{"text":"Went with a friend on Saturday night. Was packed to the rafters inside with youth league sports clubs . We were both greeted coming and going, and Denise (our server) was attentive and friendly. I had the seasonal special Spicy Cuban chicken with an upgrade of sweet potato fries for an additional $1.79 for a total of 15.01 for the sandwich which is quite pricey. It's amazing how offers to upgrade at these places aren't accompanied by disclosure. 15 for a sandwich and a handful of sweet potato fries is a bit obnoxious.  We sat out in the patio which was virtually empty. They have screens to watch The soccer and if you've been out there you have a nice view of the grain silos across Yonge Street. The development up there is at a fast clip.   Overall, this is an occasional joint of which I prefer St.Louis Bar & Grill. The staff is friendly, but there really doesn't appear to be a competitive differentiator between these types of establishments."}
{"text":"My review is going to be about their carryout, and the service we received while waiting for the food. The staff there was nothing but SUPER nice! They offered us free drinks since we had to wait about 5-10 minutes. The food was perfect, the order was all correct and from what I saw of the other staff for the eat in area, they were on their toes!! They seem to really know what their doing there!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant cuz it's very close to my house! It opens late, so i and friends can come over and after work. We love drink bluemoon, asian style wings and play games"}
{"text":"Bar tender was great explained all our options."}
{"text":"stopped in on a Saturday night with a party of 10 - down the street was a 1.5 hour wait while we walked in a sat down at this place. Overall, it was exactly what I expected. Mediocre food and drinks with a bunch of TV screens.  We shared a number of drinks. They were over-priced, lacking in liquor, and mediocre at best. Beer is definitely the way to go. We shared some Chili con Queso dip with chips as an appetizer. Came with a lot of chips and was pretty good. Though it's tough to mess up cheese and meat. I went with a honey bbq chicken salad. Overall, it was decent size, tasted good, and I was happy with it. Good mix of ingredients. My friends got some fries with bacon and cheese on top. They were fine, though the fries were a bit mushy. Service wasn't impressive either. She was nice, but didn't know the menu and forgot things. Overall, the experience was exactly what you'd expect from a buffalo wild wings."}
{"text":"B Dubbs never lets you down, I love the Mango Habanero wings, always my go to flavor and will usually try another but have not found another that I liked nearly as much."}
{"text":"So here to catch lunch. Sit at bar.  Not real busy at all.  Order wings...thats what they do right??? Two guys at bar get their BURGERS before my wings come!   Never been a big fan of this place and another reason not to be, besides being over priced."}
{"text":"I come here for one reason and one reason only: 60 cent wings on Thursday.  If it wasn't for this special, I'd probably never step food inside of a Bdubs . The food, ambiance, and service are average at best. Other than the wings, nothing else is really worth getting off the menu. The burgers and sandwiches are pretty meh and overpriced for what you get. Fortunately the wings are delicious and there is a good selection of sauces and dry rubs to go along with them.   I guess this is the place to watch sports but I always feel that the image from the  projectors is washed out and you can never quite hear whats going on. $6-7 for a beer is more than what I would want to pay for a place like Bdubs. This location in particular gets a lot of traffic especially from tourists as its just a mile south of the Strip. Service is decent if they aren't busy, but expect to wait a while for a table if its packed."}
{"text":"This places is great for watching sports. Especially football! They have tons of televisions and several projector screens. I have been up here a few times for football Sunday, and a couple UFC fights. It's absolutely awesome here!  There staff are really friendly, and know their product well. I like how they have their names in the back of their shirts, for the simple fact that I can be horrible sometimes with names.   The menus is very impressive! They have tons of different genre of foods to choose from, most importantly they have a decent drink selection as well. Before we go there let's get back to the food menu... The wings are supposed to be pretty delicious here from what I know. They have about 21 different wing sauces to choose from. I really like the Spicy Garlic!   Tuesday nights they advertise \"Wing Tuesday\" where all day they have 60 cent wings. That's pretty cool!  If your looking for a cool, entertaining sports enthused atmosphere you need to stop by and check this place out in the West Gate Plaza!"}
{"text":"Although it can get a little crowded, the waiters and waitresses are fantastic! No matter how busy it is I always receive the best service! This is a great happy hour hangout spot. Get there early on Sunday's if you want to find an open table! Love this place. Great food and great service! Always a fun time!"}
{"text":"The bartender is a psychic!! Or perhaps I just come in here too often! haha  I usually come into this location on Tuesday nights after work for the wings special. They offer 60 cent wings (Bone-In or Boneless) on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I like this location a lot because it right on my way home from work. They are located just west of Dysart Rd on McDowell Rd. on the south side of McDowell Rd.   When I come in here I usually set at the bar. Gabe the bartender, is a pretty cool guy. We've had our conversations of humor and gossip.   When I come here I order the same thing every time. Which is a tall ice cold Coors Light draft with an order of 12 spicy garlic traditional (Bone-In) wings. The spicy garlic sauce is absolutely amazing! I also like the Buffalo rub as well, but usually stay consistent with getting the spicy garlic. I would also recommend the fried pickles here! Probably the best fried pickles I have ever had at a restaurant!  This place pretty big, and in the bar area they have a lot of TV's to watch fights and sporting events, which is always cool! I usually see kids here all the time, so I would assume its great for kids, and they offer kids their own menu to order from.   I am curious to see if these guys' business will be affected or not, with the new location opening up in the Westgate plaza."}
{"text":"I think I found something better than All Stars and St. Louis! Right when we entered we were greeted warmly and asked if it was our first time here. It was, and a really nice server explained the wings section of the menu. We ordered the Cajun popcorn shrimp sandwich and various Flavours of wings, such as honey garlic, lemon pepper, garlic Parmesan, Buffalo and mango haberero. The Cajun shrimp was nicely battered and the fries that came with it was very tasty. They were like McDonald's fires and I really enjoyed it. The wings all tasted very flavourful. They're not big like All Star wings but I would prefer natural sized wings than unusually large ones. Favourite flavours of the night were dry Buffalo, garlic Parmesan and honey garlic!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I've ever had at a BWW. Our sever clearly did not care about his job. It took about 15 minutes to even get our drinks ordered. The wings were awful. They pretty much just drizzled the sauce over them. I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"We had a blast food was great service was fantastic. Zach did a great job checking in is and making sure everything was great. Love this place. Great lace to meet up with friends and family."}
{"text":"I visited last night with a friend to catch up about current events going on in our life. Now I can't remember the name of our waitress but she was an older brunette woman who was a bit on the short side. Essentially any interaction we had with her led to her going on a rant about how much she hated that store and that she hated her coworkers. Mid conversation she would sit down at our table and go on another rant about the store, customers, etc. At one point she was telling a story about terrible customers and angrily slaps my empty beer can which then hit me in the chest. Any time she would leave it would take her in some cases over twenty minutes to get back to us. I ended up having to ask another waitress for another drink. We ultimately had to hurry out of there and sit in the parking lot to finish catching up. Needless to say I'll probably not come back just to avoid being served by her. Love bdubbs.... But not this one anymore."}
{"text":"Came in to have dinner and a few beers around 10pm. I chose to sit in the bar area because i wanted to watch the game as I had a couple of beers. Bar tender came over and took our order. I had the bacon burger and some boneless wings with a few Miller lights. I specified that I did not want onions so please had no onions on the burger. The order took almost forever that I almost cancelled it, when it finally arrived the burger had onions in it and the barbecue sauce or bacon sauce in the burger was loaded with onions. I tried to scrape off the cheese and sauce because it was all mixed up and it was just too much of a mess and way to many onions.  I wish the staff would be better educated on what ingredients their products have so they know to say the sauce or what have you comes with whatever they are ordering. I sent it back, paid my bill and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of BWW's for quite some time now and I still love going there about every week or two. The food is good, the servers are usually pretty friendly, the atmosphere is nice, and the prices aren't too bad.   First off, the most important thing here, to me, are the wings. I love the traditional wings, but I've been enjoying the boneless lately because sometimes you'll get a gross chicken wing that came from a chicken on 'roids. You know, that super buff chicken that was always a jerk to all the other chickens for not being as muscular as he was... Anyways, those always taste like crap. So I've been sticking to the boneless; they're also more filling. Now the main thing at BWW's are the sauces. They have 14 sauces, 4 dry seasonings, and from time to time they will introduce a new sauce or seasoning, such as Captain Morgan sauce or Thai Curry seasoning. My all time favorite remains the Mango Habanero sauce. As far as the other food, it's really nothing special, some burgers, salads, wraps, and other basic menu items that most American casual dining restaurants will offer. Of course, you can add your favorite sauce to most of the menu items. They also offer a kid's menu and desserts.   Next are the servers and atmosphere. Most of the times that I have been to BWW's, I have had a pretty friendly server, but there have been times when my server just really sucked. But I guess you will find that with a lot of places and you shouldn't be too concerned about that aspect because it will change by location, time of day, etc....  The atmosphere is fun! A bunch of flat screens all over the walls, some projectors, there's music, (which you can pay to pick, jukebox style), playing in the background, trivia games going on, and even games that you can bring to your table and pay to play. They are always showing basketball, football, baseball, soccer, and softball games as well as Nascar races, UFC fights, and other sports events. It's really a family friendly sports bar with good food.   The prices aren't bad. A plate of wings will cost you from 6-12 dollars, depending on how many you get and if you choose bone in or boneless, which are slightly more expensive. They do have some cool deals though, like traditional Tuesdays when traditional wings are offered at 45 cents each and boneless Thursdays when boneless wings are offered at 60 cents each. Typically, ranch and celery/carrots come on the side at no additional cost, however on these days it costs 60 cents extra for each cup of ranch.   Buffalo Wild Wings is a good place to grab a quick lunch or to watch the game with the guys and enjoy some good wings and a couple beers. If you haven't been, I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Why bother coming here. I waited 45min for a take out. What the hell is going on? Their all so rude. Worst bww ever."}
{"text":"BWW is quickly becoming me and my boyfriend favorite place to go! The new Mac n cheese bites are amazing and our orders come out correct and quick every. single. time. The attentiveness of the wait staff is 10/10. Our server today, Shaun, was the best service we have ever experienced. Refills, extra sauces, he knew the menu fully and was pleasant and professional. Amazing job to the entire staff there. Even the host, Amanda was smiling and greeted us. Will always come back and recommend BWW!"}
{"text":"Great place to come if you are a sports fan or like big women which I'm not a fan of. One waitress was sweating. I had to check my phone for latest cpr techniques just in case she coded."}
{"text":"Went here for an \"employee meeting\" today and was pleasantly surprised. The host and waitress were really nice, and we had some good service. Ended up ordering a Bleu & Black burger and it was good - fries were okay, a little soggy from the huge ass pickle with all its pickle juice but I didn't mind all too much... probably because I was so hungry.   I won't go out of my way to come back to BW3, but I also wouldn't object either. So this place gets an okay from me. If anything, I can always update my review!"}
{"text":"Went here on Wednesday and there were several things wrong!  I ordered a drink (can't remember what it was called?) It was in the menu, rum chatta pumpkin martini.  The description sounded amazing and included a cinnamon sugar rim.  I love cinnamon so I was excited to try this!  Well, it was brought to me literally 1/2 filled in a martini glass with NO cinnamon sugar rim!!  I mentioned this to the server and she could care less and just said i'll get you some more water.  Normally a server would say oh I'm so sorry or I apologize, I will tell the bar tender or can I get you another one.  Nope!  The place is absolutely dirty!  The drink menus (menus that stay on each table) are just swimming in bacteria.  I'm not just talking about a few finger prints.  There is nasty crust and grease caked on.  Pretty sure they have never been wiped down like ever.  Went to the bathroom and the door is just as disgusting!!! There were 5 employees standing around talking, doing literally NOTHING!  If I owned this placed, you better believe my employees would be staying busy and wiping all everything down etc.  Also, our server was new we were done eating and I could find her for 30 mins and we needed to leave!!!  My fiance and I eat and BWW often but we won't be coming back to this location until the menus and doors are sanitized and they learn how to make what's on their menu!!"}
{"text":"Tonight I walked In to this establishment and was seated by the hostess. I waited... and waited ... and waited for 25 minutes while watching  four waitresses walk by me .... not one of them asked if I'd been helped. Then the same hostess walked by and looked at me ... clearly realizing that after so much time passed I still hadn't been helped. She immediately came to my table asked if anyone helped, then took my order. She brought out my food and occasionally checked up me. She was awesome! Although the boneless wings tasted like they were two days old I didn't  complain simply because the hostess was so nice! She would be the only reason that I would change this one star to a five .... if you eat here  I'd suggest asking for Dee (detoria)  the hostess to be your waitress"}
{"text":"The wings the wings the wings. When I'm working this is my spot to eat wings real simple fast and easy. If you're in for late night ID is needed. Beers on tap alcoholic beves to many to mention but the wings is mean.plus this Vegas spot is 24hrs"}
{"text":"We go for the wings-NEVER the service until last night and we hope that this gal is working when we go in again- Mariah(please forgive me if I spelled it wrong).  She was adorably polite, professional, and poised!  Thank you again."}
{"text":"This is the BWW location that I visit the most often. It's pretty convenient for me and my coworkers to visit after work, considering we work on the strip.   This location stays fairly busy, especially during special sporting events. Currently, their traditional Tuesday's and boneless Thursday's have their wings priced at 70 cents each. My coworkers and I typically come during one of two days and it is busy then too. We usually go in big groups, so we have to at least wait for 15 minutes, but typically we wait for a good 30 minutes. One good thing is that they don't require your entire party to be there to be sat, so if you have one person that can go ahead in your party to reserve your seats, I would recommend that.   A downside for it being consistently busy is that the servers have a lot to handle, and can sometimes take a while to take your order, or to come back and check up on you. That's a problem I consistently came across, but once you see what it looks like, you can't really blame them, but the problem is still there. The food is just as delicious here as any other BWW location so if you are craving their wings or cheesecake bites, it's just as great of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Well what is there to know about this big chain restaurant?  I only ever get chicken wings from here for the fact that it is what they are known for. The selection of sauces and rubs are nice. The wings are fried pretty well and the breading is pretty decent. The area has tv's everywhere and sporting events on them. That's at all of them, but that's the best part of going to buffalo wild wings, to sit down and enjoy a nice game with your buddies. I wish they served food that's wasn't fried but still a nice place."}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant time at this BWW location with my friends. We were a fairly large party with 10 people and the employees did their best to seat us all together since it was a little packed due to an NBA playoff game. When they seated us, we had an awesome server named Josh. He was super friendly and helped us all throughout the night, taking good care of us. The food always takes a while to come out of here, due to it needing to be fried, tossed, etc, but he let us know and of course we were ok with it. The wings came out fresh and amazing, like always. They had all of the best games going on their TVs and it was all good, no complaints."}
{"text":"My family used to come here all the time, haven't been there in 6 months due to our favorite waiter gone.  Went there tonight because we miss it.  OMG! was the worst experience! Staff was boring, no smiles, no good service, no fun,  over priced beers on happy hour.  So sad that this place was the \"happening \" spot,  what happened? ? I blame it on the staff and probably poor management.  If they aren't outgoing and friendly then customers aren't going to enjoy themselves. If this place doesn't change soon they will never survive.  And, apparently according  to other yelp reviews I'm not the only one.  Get it together Buffalo!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. I've never had worse service in my life! We got sat, and literally sat there in the corner for 15 minutes without being greeted. As all the staff starred at me and my boyfriend.. None of them did anything. We just sat there. Finally someone comes over & apologizes. Doesn't comp us anything or offer anything for waiting so long AND the silverware was dirty. I'm talking still had Asian zing sauce on the fork. Food was gross, never had a refill. Will never go here again! People need to know how to do their job. One more thing. Manager walks by & just looks at us. HA. PATHETIC."}
{"text":"Ok -I have to start out with full disclosure..I walked in to place a takeout order at 6:30pm on a Sat night during a Cardinals game. (I planned on putting in some wait time, and I was OK with that) I always order to go from this location, so I've become familiar with a few of the gals who work the to go desk.. I must say, none of them work hard at customer service. (I don't demand much, acknowledgement, correct order, and good quality, that's it.. I am not one of those demanding consumers who think you owe me the world just because I'm there in front of you) Back to the take out desk staff; Most are young, I get that, but the \"meh\" attitude is prevalent. It pisses me off to spend good money on dining and feel like I've been ripped off, because of that, I try and make sure and be very specific when I order-  Here's how it went: \"15 traditional wings, ranch on the side, wings extra crispy, appetizer of street tacos\" - that was it.  I waited an hour, (which I was fine with) my food was brought out . It's SO SAD, but I know to NEVER, EVER leave with take out food until you CHECK THE ORDER. ( seems so silly, it's take out food, for goodness sakes!) but people do NOT CARE!! Most only care if your order is wrong IF YOU BRING IT BACK..  Back to the food .. I check the order before leaving:  1) no ranch, but 3 blue cheese 2) street tacos are so cold the grease on the chicken has begun to congeal 3) wings are not extra crispy, but soggy, soggy, soggy I tell the \"meh\" gal in the takeout booth, who says she will get the manager. She comes back out and says,\" my manager wants to look at your food.\"  Me: \"OK, it's right here, is she going to come look at it?\" \"Meh\" girl: \"no, she wants me to TAKE your food to her so she can look at it\" WTF? What? Your Manager can't even come to the front to talk with a dissatisfied customer? You want to TAKE my food back to the kitchen it just came from so someone can possibly poke their fingers all over it so see...what? If I'm telling the truth? What? I ask her to have the manager come speak directly with me, please.  A manager comes up front, it was a woman, and she pretty much had the same,\"meh\" attitude as the take out crew.. But mentioned that she would go to the kitchen and see how quickly they could make it right.  I sat for another 15minutes and finally asked another gentleman, (who was also wearing the Red shirts managers wear) if he wouldn't mind helping me and checking to see the status of my order. I was not willing to wait ANOTHER hour for them to get my order right..  He immediately went to the kitchen, checked in the status, came back and notified me, and apologized (the FIRST one to do so). I explained the situation to him, he then said he would personally oversee the order before it came back out, AND he pulled up my original check and removed the charge for the wings, altogether. Now THAT is a manager who cares about service! I would have been fine without the refund. I just wanted somebody to acknowledge that this was NOT that difficult if an order to get right! And DEFINITELY not an order that should have taken the 1.75 hours to prepare correctly.  Manager (male, NOT THE FEMALE) is on top if it. There were several phone calls and food returns that happened during my almost 2hrs in this place; every one if them that HE handled, the customer left happy.  Sorry if you have a problem and you get the female manager (or assistant manager, not sure) with the \"meh\" attitude, she must be the one who trains the take out staff.? I will go back, but I will never leave here without checking every item in my order..( so far it's 10 for 10 there has been something wrong) Ouch!"}
{"text":"Should have been 2 stars, I Ordered the naked tenders, I asked if they could grill them with the sauce it was ok, but when it arrived it was breaded tenders,not naked fresh, grilled, the server had an attitude ,like it was my fault, then my friend's finish eating before my food returned, and was slightly undercooked, so I pretend to eat, then paid my bill and we left. Very very sad, the server never really cared whether or not the food was right the second time. Needless to say not coming back, Cleveland doesn't rock it sucks at wild wings."}
{"text":"Servers drinking behind cut outs by bar,e smokers in bar dining really still city ordinance outside only! Waiter have to flag down to get a refill or an order I know it's Friday night but rules still apply!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 1 star because I have no choice...well husband and I decided to take our daughter out to dinner for her 17th Birthday. We walked in...young girl sat us outside (thats where we chose to sit) she gave us menu's..........thats it! We sat for 35 minutes waiting for someone to take our order and noone showed up. 1 waiter helped 1 table full of people ( 6 total) but never acknowledged us....looked at us from the corner of his eye and went on his merry way. After waiting 35 minutes for someone to at least take our order I turn \"H-angry\" we got up and walked out. The girl who sat us down seened us and never asked what the problem was....she turned her back and ignored us. I will never step a foot in this place. Btw...It was NOT busy at all if it was I would've definitely understood...but it was Wednesday  630pm on March 2nd."}
{"text":"Ate here on 3/19/11. They were getting ready for UFC Fight night. The hostess must have asked me 3x if we were staying for the fight. Each time I said no. Ok, we finally get seated, didn't have to wait long but no waitress to take drink or food orders. We had to flag a poor waitress down to get noticed. My wife got the shrimp with Mango Habanero sauce. She loved the sauce! Daughter got the mozarella sticks with ranch. I got the boneless wings with spicey garlic sauce. The wings were good just on the little large size. Good ambience and alot of sports action going on (March Madness, NBA, etc). Too many of the same tvs showing the same college basketball game but overall ok."}
{"text":"It's average, had a burger and have had alot better ones in a lot of other places. Typical pub food but you pay more for the ambience. The only thing I have enjoyed here is there steak/roast beef wrap. Everything else is just average."}
{"text":"I have always had great service with a smile here. Very attentive, I sit in the bar area and when I want something fast and easy, my girlfriend and I come here. The street tacos are awesome along with their fries. I live right around the corner and enjoy this place."}
{"text":"We came here at 6:35pm. A group of 9, with four kids under the age of 10. We sat outside and looked at the menus for drinks. We were happy we were there before 7pm so we could get the happy hour. We waited and 10 mins go by, no service. 20 mins goes by and still no acknowledgement, at this point we are pretty upset and thirsty. At least to get some drinks since we are outside. My sister goes in to let them know we have been waiting outside for 25 mins now with no service. He tells her they will be with us as soon as possible. She asks if it will be before the happy hour to place our drink order. At this moment it's about to be 7pm. She says if he could give us the happy hour price since we have been waiting. He says no that after the happy hour at 7pm there is NO WAY, him as the manager, can change it in the system. She is outraged at this moment. She says don't worry about it and gets our party of 9 to leave the restaurant. We have never witness such horrible customer service to not even acknowledge us for 25 mins. The worst part of this all, if I have never been to Buffalo Wild Wings. This was my first visit. I wonder if this is a common trend with them.."}
{"text":"Came here twice this week, Monday and then Sunday  for the broncos game.. Monday night was slow, I was surprised that not that many people were in the place. Our server was on top of it, and our meal was great.  Got the honey BBQ wings. Onion rings daughter get the mini corn dogs (I'm not sure why lol)  everything was great except for the game ;/ !! sunday, the place was packed but I can't believe  how huge this one is compared to the one on las vegas Blvd. our server was so so, had to ask many other to get things for us it's nice to sit back and watch many games at once or just watch your own team.. tons of tvs everywhere, a fun atmosphere to hand with some friends if you can't be at the game"}
{"text":"the applebees/outback of chicken wings.  i see a lot of bad reviews - but how can you? it's a franchised sports bar. you can't come in here expecting top notch server or food for that matter. i don't go to denny's expecting a 5 star steak house service and food. you get what you pay for and BWW is cheap food. 'nuff said.  i throughly enjoy the habenaro mango bone in wings. it's something i crave day in and day out. the beer on tap is always ice cold. and tho the servers aren't the most personable people - they get the job done in a timely manner that i can't complain.   i'll prolly be back to sweat from the heat of the wings and cool it off with a beer sooner than later!"}
{"text":"We always sit at the bar. Swing bar tenders are beyond amazing...Nando and Tonya. I can't say enough good things. We come here a lot. I only recommend Sat-Tue graveyard. Drew is no nonsense and has a dry, funny sense of humor...very efficient. We've been coming here for years and will continue to come here."}
{"text":"I think everyone knows what to expect here for the food, so I'll skip that and add my review to the torrent of other reviews that lament the miserable service at this place. If I could give this place negative stars I would.  The manager doesn't know how many bartenders to schedule on a busy night and consequently they are miserably understaffed on popular sports game nights.  Then to top it off, when the bartender does get a minute away from making drinks for the tables, she instantly jumps to her phone to update facebook or send a few texts to friends rather than check her own customers seated at the bar.  Meanwhile, empty beer glasses are piling up at the bar and everyone is looking thirsty or wondering where their checks are so they can leave.  There is nothing more miserable than sitting for 30 minutes and being ignored by a bartender that is walking right in front of you.  Shame on the manager for not having a clue about his staff's lack of attention to customers and not knowing that SO many customers are unhappy.  As for the bartenders...find a new job because it isn't hard to keep people's drinks full and ask them if they need anything else more often than once every half hour instead of updating facebook and sending texts.  What's even worse is that for all the TV's that they have, they basically have them tuned to two channels even when those channels only have the same boring sports wonks droning on and on about the NFL that are over and done with.  There's a ton of other sports out there that are going on and GOOD sports bars know this.  BWW doesn't have a clue about being a real sports bar.  Go somewhere else, because the service at this place sucks and that a bit unusual for this chain. Corporate needs to step in and do some serious house-cleaning of the staff here."}
{"text":"The best server I've ever had is at this location Katie is amazing . I drive from trop and Pecos just to come to this location. The rest of the staff is amazing as well the food is awesome ."}
{"text":"In my search for Beer and Wings, this is where the hubs and I ended up. Right away I felt annoyed by the person sitting behind me, but I was here to eat! We ordered a sampler with wings, mozzarella sticks and a small stack of nachos. It was very filling for the price. Then we ordered the medium size set of wings (18) so I could try different sauces. Overall we tried the carribean jerk, asian zing, medium and hot bbq. All flavors were really good. I was happy with everyone we tried. Next time we won't get the boneless because there was soooo much breading but overall they were tasty. Our server was very soft spoken and we waited a long time between requests. (e.g. may we have blue cheese? sure. 20 mins later we reminded him.) We each also ordered beer and were never offered another. So instead I asked for a water to soak up some of the spice. But our glasses sat empty for quite some time. I also overheard a server and and a hostess arguing right next to me about why she wasn't sat and that she had 2 open tables etc.... Overall, food okay... Service is lacking. No one was rude, but no one really seemed to care about their tables either. I would totally go back if I didn't have my kids with me and I was just looking to drink and watch a game with some good food."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was my fried pickles.  The service was bad, but   I can't blame the waitress for that.  The place was full and she was the only one running around.  It took about 10-15 mins when we were sat down for anyone to ask what we wanted to drink and almost a 20-25 min wait for us to get our food. When I got my wings they were cold and dry.  More staff and the service would probably have been better."}
{"text":"I absolutely love BWW. It's a great chain of restaurants and I totally love it! As for this location.... not so much. First impression, the staff ISN'T friendly or welcoming AT ALL. Been to this BWW twice now and pretty much had the same experience both times. We weren't greeted when we first walked in, instead we received a dirty stare from the two female servers standing at the hostess stand. We brushed it off and actually did their job for them by friendly greeting them, \"Hi, how are you? Table for 6 please.\" Seated a few moments later. Inexperienced waiter. Plenty of room for improvements needed on the waitstaff. Perhaps they should enforce stricter management or emphasize the fact that customers needs more attention from them rather than their phones or socializing amongst each other. The entire restaurant had possibly 5 tables AT MOST during the times of our visits. Our food took at least 30 minutes both times, had a messed up order (didn't complain, brushed it off as well), and by the time we received it the food looked as though it's been sitting out for a bit. Overall, I wouldn't choose to come to this BWW if it wasn't the last resort. Two stars were generously given just for their sanitation and the fact that we received food at all."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer since my 1st visit! They take care of me! If they get the order wrong, it is promptly corrected! Their wings rock! Management is awesome!  That \"other place\" sucks! They do not care! They have more flavors, but service is rude and pitiful! Go to B-Dub!!!!"}
{"text":"Would have been 5 stars but Sara refused to turn the music up and we spent a lot of money and no there weren't a lot of people in the place Seth on the other hand is only reason they get three stars Sara you got your location 3 stars instead of 5 Way to go Sara even a little more volume would have been cool but hey who am I the customer to ask you to turn the volume up on a juke box for music I paid to listen to if your business doesn't like music then they should get rid of the jukebox   You need more employees like Seth GO SETH!!! Actually in fact Seth gets 5 stars Sara you get 1"}
{"text":"Mediocrity everywhere, you're better off eating some wings from Sonic's instead.  The staff doesn't care for the customer and it really shows in the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"This food is the definition of mediocre. Wasn't bad, but wasn't great. If I have a real hankering for wings, I'll go somewhere else. Don't get me wrong, this place is not bad, it's just not memorable."}
{"text":"Right in the zone for wings.  Similar to other major wing joints, BWW has a good variety of standard bar foods, and wings are the centerpiece.  I ordered the Lemon Pepper Wings for a quick late lunch.  They arrived at the table, hot and crispy with great flavour.  I could have had more, but paying over $20 for a feed of wings just doesn't sit well, when I could have a great sushi meal for the same price.  BWW is clearly a sports bar, with tons of video screens showing the same content in a variety of different hues (video screens should be calibrated).  Camp out at a table with friends and a load of beer and wings and watch something!"}
{"text":"Save yourself the time, and money, and head to the location on Hualapai.   I placed an order for take-out last night at approximately 11:15PM, for pickup at 11:40PM. I arrived a little late, at 11:50PM; the girl at the front desk was originally perplexed and asked if I was \"sure I was at the right store\" until she opened up the order on her screen. She then said she would go and grab it from the back for me. Ten minutes later, she came out and said it \"was going to be a few minutes,\" as one of the \"wing orders was extra crispy.\" I noted when the order was placed, and the designation for pick-up time, a time that was now twenty minutes past (i.e., the wings should have been ready before I had even arrived.) Finally, at ten past midnight (I would have left, but she completely disappeared, giving me no opportunity to receive a refund and leave), she came out with my wings. No apology, no refund, no offer to bring a manager forward. Just a blank stare.  To add insult to injury, when I opened my order at home (I should have checked it in store, but at that point I just wanted to leave and get home after sitting at BWW for a half hour) it was not fulfilled correctly.   As I said previously, save yourself the time and money, and head up to Hualapai for BWW. At least their service is timely, consistent, and their staff are attentive and responsive."}
{"text":"I feel like the girls who work at bdubs are usually snooty but not at this location. I usually order pick up for lunch at this location and the girls are always so friendly to me! I think they have great service at this location."}
{"text":"Gluten free awesome wings FTW!!!! Yeah, this was some serious awesome wings... HOWEVER... If you are there to have a family birthday dinner (or something similar where you want to talk to each other). This might not be the place for you. BUT if you are there to watch some sort of sporting event on tv and yell at the top of your lungs for a good solid hour or so, this is your place! I would go and bear the noise again just for the wings though. I'll just prepare myself and the crew I go with better next time. :)"}
{"text":"The service here is TERRIBLE! Slow and rude. Just throw the food on the table. Don't offer straws and silverware until we had to ask for them. Server would leave and not come back for 15 min. Jamila was so rude and wasn't friendly to us. The food was fine but the service made it so we won't come back to this location."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short. Bad service expensive food and charges for dip. Gave them 3 tries. They are out."}
{"text":"BW3s has a great atmosphere but the food is not consistently good. Every once in a while their wings will be pretty good but not too often. There is almost always a long wait to get in and the service is barely average."}
{"text":"I went the other day 6/9 for lunch and I had Ashleigh as a server. She was an amazing server. She made sure my drink was always full and made sure I was pleased with my meal. It was my first time going there and she explained what the Traditional Tuesday deal was and also made sure I knew they charged extra for the ranch. She recommended the fried pickles which were phenomenal. I plan on going back there for lunch very often and I hope I get her as my server again!!"}
{"text":"It's probably a little weird that I come here and normally order a pulled pork sandwich rather than wings, right? Well, welcome to my reality!  Again, this is one of those places located near my job so I come here due to convenience rather than quality. However, it's obviously not that bad where it stops me from coming altogether.   They have a 'fast-break' lunch menu consisting of about six items - one of them being the hickory pulled pork sandwich - that ranges in price from $5.99 to about $9.99. The sauce that's used is smoky sweet and the pork is juicy, topped with crisp, cool coleslaw and pickled onions. The fries that come with are typically hot and slightly salty. It's the one thing I've found that is consistently good.  Service can be hit or miss here. Definitely don't bother coming here with a large party greater than five people. Your food will be crawling its way to the table. Also, they have a sign on the doors stating that anyone under the age of 18 is not permitted to dine inside without a parent/guardian....which I find a little odd and would love to know what drove them to make that decision."}
{"text":"Overpriced, dirty, how do people waste their money there? Food sucks!"}
{"text":"Awful service standard bbw food.  Came with my lady friend for a late night meal.   Took at least 15 mins for a server to come to our table. He forgot to bring us water until I flagged him down.   Time between him greeting us and getting us our waters, 30 mins.   Manager came up to is to ask how everything was while we were eating but too little too late I'm not one to make a scene.   This place is slow and careless but that seems to be the trend at any bww.   Don't expect much from this place."}
{"text":"Well I sit here still waiting for my server to get my check and I must say this has not be the best BDubs experience. To start a co worker and I decided to catch the Orange Bowl and AZ vs ASU basketball game and what better place BDubs. Well the place was busy as expected with lots of sports on but we were able to get a table in the bar right away. Our server did seem a little flustered but I worked in the industry so i understand and can be patient with good service. Well she came and dropped off our drinks and she didn't stop back but for another 20 mins. This was ok because I noticed she was busy and we were watching the game. Friend order mozzarella stick and they came out pretty fast, unfortunately it was another 30 mins or so before she stopped back by. She did apologize for the wait and asked if we were ready to order more food. We order a small order of traditional wings all flats and a snack pack of boneless. Once again our server was not as attentive to us and did notice the about an 50 mins had gone buy and our order still had not come. She did get us a water refill in there some where. I eventually stopped her and asked if she could check on our order. She did and came back with some excuse that our food was behind some big party on the dining room. Two things I noticed in this 50+ min wait, tables that were sat after us received food and I didn't see any party large enough to put our small order an hour behind. Or food took another 15 mins or so (guessing on the fly) and when they came she said she would talk to a manager about our wait and see if she could take something off. We finally asked for the check and of course nothing was taken off and she didn't even say she spoke to the manager. I bartend and have served so I understand being busy but I always checked in with my table and kept them in the loop on what's going on. If there were a big enough party I would have let my table know and they would not have to track me down to find out. A little communication and actual service does go a long way. I was here to enjoy the game so the wait wasn't the issue but more the lack of paying attention to your tables. I'll be back here but I'm very disappoint in tonights service. And of course a manager never stopped buy to see how things went so I have not gotten a chance to speak with anyone. Just very disappointed."}
{"text":"horrible service ... waitress didnt even know beer of the month !i had to tell her what it was !,,"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I like wings, sports and beer, so I'm predisposed to like a place like this one.   Service is always attentive. We are always amazed at how many employees they have. Good business sense to keep the drinks flowing and wings hot to the table. Friendly staff who know their menu is always big in my book.   Food is above typical bar food level. I enjoy their wings and they'll cook to order. Mine must be crunchy. They try new sauces and rubs on a regular basis. The gnome enjoys the wings and an occasional burger or wrap. She also considers their cosmos to be very good and potent. At the 3 Cosmo level, reached only once, she transformed into the zombie gnome. No worries - I was the driver.   Friendly staff, good bar food, sports, and good drinks. A good place to meet pals and watch a hockey or football game."}
{"text":"No matter what day, whether the restaurant is busy or empty, the wait time for food is ABSURD. There's literally 2 tables here. I ordered to go food 40 minutes ago, and still waiting. The employees are friendly, but the wait is just too long and it's been that way every single time."}
{"text":"Options, options, options.   Wet or dry wings, sauce or no sauce, sweet or spicy, and if it's spicy, well then please indicate how spicy you want it... talk about a plethora of wing options to make your head hurt.  Thank goodness they have a neverending wings buffet option because the last thing I really want to do while eating is make hard decisions...  So just bring me every single flavor one order at a time. A great way to discover your options and get your money's worth.  A great place for families. It sounded like a recipe for disaster when we walked in and said, table for 10, and we need 2 highchairs, 2 baby slings, total of 6 kids and 4 adults... But it was good, and we weren't rushed, and our server was nice. Not to mention we had tried every single wing in the joint (no pun intended).  Til we meet again Buffalo Wild Wings..."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. it is typical bar food and the wings are sub par. There is way better in town. The cheese sauce and nachos have a weird taste to them.  Way too sweet for me. One positive...the BEER is always cold!  I love their seasonal choices. My favorite during this time of year is the Leinenkugel Summer Shandy."}
{"text":"I don't think I will be returning to this place.  It's very frustrating when you arrive and see many empty tables and your told to wait. That should have been the sign.  We finally get seated place our order and 15 minutes later my beer that I had ordered arrived,  warm I might add.  My wife orders a cup of ice and I'm guessing they were waiting for the ice to freeze.  Because we had to ask for it 3 times,  I said 3 times.  I ordered wings and after 40 minutes they arrive but I didn't know what was what because there was like no sauce on any of the wings.  Avoid Courtney at all cost,  she forgets about you.  Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Cold beer and friendly faces. Love this bar. Come here all the time when traveling for business."}
{"text":"Ate at Buffalo Wild Wings at Norterra last night because my son is a wing fanatic. I don't like to eat there often, because frankly I think it's always expensive for what you get.  We ordered a medium basket of medium hot wings and a side of fries. I spotted a margarita on the table next to ours that looked great, so I decided to order one too, but as a Cadillac. Now a Cadillac Margarita is a really common drink that any bartender should know hands down . It's simply a float of Gran Marnier on top! Nope. Not the bartender at BWW in Norterra. She came to the table to have me explain what I wanted. I got my drink and it was pretty tasty. I told her just to give me the house tequila (Souza Gold, I believe), nothing fancy.  In the meantime,  the food came out and while the fries tasted good,  they were completely cold. My server was sweet, but her timing was off all night, and it seemed difficult for her to multitask. After several minutes went by I ended up taking the fries to the bartender to see if we could get some fresh ones that were hot. The second batch came out perfectly, fresh out of the fryer. The manager brought them out and I mentioned the first order was really cold, and he literally shrugged it off, and said nothing!  The wings were good,  with medium heat and lots of sauce. We enjoyed our meal until the bill came. They rang my Cadillac margarita as two separate drinks totaling nearly $16!! I about died! I asked my server to please send the manager over so that I could talk to him about the price of my cheap house margarita with Gran Marnier. He never came to the table . He simply told her the closest drink on the menu is their top shelf margarita which also has Gran Marnier and Premium Tequila for 9.75, which is what they charged me. I waited nearly 10 minutes for them to adjust the tab. No apology , no nothing.  I know now that BWW is not the place to order a Cadillac margarita. It's also a place to not have very high expectations, and with that kind of manager, it makes sense. For a $45 tab (with tip) for a medium basket of wings and one order of fries with a soda and a cheap house Cadillac margarita, it seems that it should be a better experience."}
{"text":"Hmm...this place is ok. Just ok, nothing more. We went on a Friday night expecting it to be busy but it really wasn't (was this a sign?! Probably). The actual wings were good, but the service was horrible. We were seated by one person, introduced to another, then had yet another waitress bring us drinks, and another one bring us the food! We probably saw our actual waitress twice and she gets NO points for service at all. I will reiterate that it was not busy; she had maybe 2-3 other tables. Half the time we couldn't find her at all and were constantly left without refills, etc. No hope of ordering anything else. She FINALLY came back after 15 minutes of us waiting with empty drinks and empty plates and halfheartedly asked if we wanted anoything else. No! Just the bill, please, before you disappear again! And after that, another 20 minutes of waiting ensued. My boyfriend just got up to pay at the front because at that point, we'd had enough. If you're going to eat here, order take-out."}
{"text":"There are way more waiters/waitresses than customers and no one has been to our table yet. We have been sitting here close to 15 minutes. No \"I will be right with you\". Nothing. Everyone else is being served and we are being ignored. This is unacceptable. We will not be back at this location. Obviously the manger does not want our business because all she did was apologize and try to make an excuse. What she should've done was agree that the way we were treated was unacceptable and have someone take our order. We haven't been to BWW's in years. Our little boy was looking forward to it. Good job disappointing him."}
{"text":"I love this place! My favourite place for wings, a quick chicken burger, or even chicken strips. I love it. Huge fan! sometimes the wings are a bit small and weird tasting, but most of the time they were perfect. The servers are super friendly and the service is quick! great place."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect for phenomenal Tuesday prices. They do mess up orders often and consistently fall behind schedule, but we keep going back for those crispy, delicious wings."}
{"text":"I like coming here but the only problem is how slow the service is here. Other than that, everything else is great."}
{"text":"If I could I'd give it 0 for the service. The foods great but the service is terrible. I pick my mom up from mcdonalds and we eat here sometimes for breakfast. It takes literally 15-20 mins to get seated. Every time it takes forever & today i have to wait till 8:10am for a server to get here so we can order? What kind of 24 hour restaurant is this? Who leaves their place unattended at the front?! Someone could just walk in and grab a soda or whatever and they wouldn't even notice tbh. There is nobody in the front watching the place. How do you keep your customers if no ones at the front?! Seriously got here at 7:40 and it's ridicules having to wait till 8:10 for a server.. what was the point of opening BWW at the strip with this kind of service?"}
{"text":"Wings are good. Prices are on the high end but not reduce loud. Staff is friendly. Place is noisy but there are a ton of games on so got in the spirit. Just don't order the \"Supreme Nachos\" there is absolutely nothing supreme about it. My hubby and kid love this place so I am sure that they will come again."}
{"text":"Very nice place to have good food and drink and watch some sports. Went there for a few hockey games and it was pretty cool. Having the game on more than 5 big screens is pretty neat! They have a wide selection of drinks which is awesome, and as of yet I have not had a bad meal there! Servers are always nice and the wait usually isn't that long for food even on a busy night. Certainly a cool hang out, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"By far the best service I've had at a Buffalo Wild Wings! Jessie and Sarah at the bar were so friendly and knowledgeable, the manager Mark came over and made sure everything was good! Kevin was a great captain and had the tv setup on point! Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"I would not choose to eat on the premises--but that is entirely on me, at 72, I am more comfy hanging at the Christian Science Reading Room or Lawn Bowling.  So I really have little experience with wings.  BUT, with BWW one can order online, choose a pickup time.  And I did just that and crossed Harmon Street from the Marriott Grand Chateau for the ez pickup.  Hey, the wings were delicious!  And so many dipping sauces.   I am going to order once more while I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We had a very good experience here. Wings were very good.  Plenty of flavors to choose from. Some very spicy. The salt and vinegar fries were the best! Mac & cheese was ok not the best. Service was perfect! We will be back."}
{"text":"What a terrible place to go eat. Went here with my 6 month old baby and your not allowed to have a stroller in the dinning room which made eating difficult. Out table was not in the way of anything and having the stroller would of not been a big deal. Since my son was asleep we have to wake him up and it was real pleasant to deal with that. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich which took almost 40 minutes and they brought me the blue cheese one. Girl said the kitchen screwed it up but the ticket said blue cheese. There was 8 tables in the place that were full so they must of not had more than one cook in the kitchen. I would not go back."}
{"text":"I can't say I'm a very well traveled BWW person - I think I've been to maybe four different location - but this one is pretty descent in that it has lots of seating spaces (booths, raised bars, bar chairs) and lots of TV monitors. Plus the food is consistently good and the beer selection is adequate. The bathroom could stand to be a little larger and cleaner, but hey, for a sports bar, not a bad place to hang out."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is hands down the perfect place for wings, I've had it many times and I don't think I can go a month without my Buffalo Wild Wings! The levels of spicy are amazing I always get hot and above with my wings and I usually get the Blazon dipping sauce for my fries. The service is amazing as well and the servers are extremely nice and get exactly what you want. One day I hope to do the Blazon Wing Challenge and beat it, but anyway this is defiantly a 5/5."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Our server was Una (sorry if I spelled that wrong). She was very attentive. Appetizer, salads, and wings came out all in a timely manner. Kept us stocked up on drinks. Very sweet girl. We're visiting from Lubbock, Texas and this Buffalo Wild Wings was far better than any back home!"}
{"text":"Terrible boneless wings and service. Ordered wings To Go at 5:48. Was told 15 to 20 minutes. My Husband went in to get them when we got there and after spending an hour in the car with my toddler we finally come in and then there done, the time is 7:25. We live only a few miles away, when we get home the wings are cold and hard."}
{"text":"I ordered the nachos with no meat then my food was brought out with MEAT!!!!! It's against my religion and had to wait after my friends food was out and I sat there waiting. As a Vegas resident this is upsetting. Never had problem when danna was my server."}
{"text":"First off... LOVE the fried mushrooms and fried pickles... honestly can't really find those anywhere else around - not that i've seen.  Wings are always good though I do have a issue with the amount of hard breading that's on the boneless chicken wings... always seems excessive.   Salsa seems to change temperature, the girl says sometimes it's too hot for her, but mostly is the same. Different cooks perhaps?   Celery costs extra = lame... it's frickin celery... Anyways, at least they don't charge for refills lol... (yet).  Location is great for college/pro sports as it's packed and always some good cheering going on... fun to be there during games.  Place gets packed during UFC fights too fyi.  Cool basketball arcade game too!  Lots of TV's too"}
{"text":"Best place at the mall to watch sports and great place to relax/drink if the girl is inside shopping and spending money :)  Not sure how long this location has been here because I think I remember it being something else, but then again I'm not one to frequent malls too often.   First off... LOVE the fried mushrooms and fried pickles... honestly can't really find those anywhere else around - not that i've seen.  Wings are always good though I do have a issue with the amount of hard breading that's on the boneless chicken wings... always seems excessive.

Anyways, at least they don't charge for refills lol... (yet). But overall pricing is fair and normal.  This location is very clean, again which leads me to believe it's newer? Seems to be great TV viewing, more-so in the bar area than the table area however - so be mindful of that. Service was quick and very friendly. Outside patio along the walkway near chipotle in the mall is good for people watching too, however you have to deal with no TV's and smokers :/"}
{"text":"What can you say - its a BWW - but the layout is good and food is very good. Great place for games and great selection of beers."}
{"text":"two words. MANGO HABANERO ;)  im a regular on tuesdays for .45 cent wings... but damn, do i have to bring my own bottle of Ranch sauce in my purse, since they charge .50 per little bitty serving? I GUESS."}
{"text":"Oh BDubs. I love their wings, I hate their service.  Last time we were there it wasn't busy, so you would think there wouldn't be an issue with not getting what we wanted.  The first thing we asked to play the trivia game (which you need boxes for)... and never got them. She took our orders, but never asked anything was and was generally just not there.  It was really frustrating to see her flirting with the guy at their stand (with trivia boxes right there) rather than serve us instead."}
{"text":"Great wings and the best spinach cheese dip and pita chips I've ever had ... Terrible mojitos though. Fun sports vibe, good for groups."}
{"text":"This BWWs is pretty good for eating at the restaurant, but less consistent when it comes to take out. The orders seem hastily put together (one order of wings barely had sauce on them while the other wings were sitting in 1/2 inch of sauce, forgot all the ranch and bleu cheese.) Dining room staff is always friendly though!"}
{"text":"I like BW3s and at home, I'm a regular (once or twice a month).  I enjoy sitting at the bar and watching a game, and the food is decent but well priced.  At this location (visiting from out of town), I walked in and the bar was completely empty, which I've never seen at the one I usually go to.  Then when I sat down, I quickly learned why...it stunk.  The area smelled like cheap cleaning products, kind of like bleach with other heavy cleansers.  I ended up having a beer and leaving, and that was too long."}
{"text":"Great service I was having an issue and the server lace (super sweet) made sure to call Christiana the manage to take care of us and she was amazing super helpful makes me want to come here every time. Love Bww thank you ladies and thank you for making my lil ones bday a great experience"}
{"text":"I'm a restaurant guy, so it's tough for me to leave a less than stellar Yelp review on a restaurant.  BUT... the last 2-3 times of visiting this unit, well it's actually been horrible. And it's too bad, cause we like BWW in most locations. But this franchise needs help...soon. We came in at 9pm tonight, had to patiently wait for a total of 10 minutes to be seated while our eventual server walked away after we had waited 4 minutes to be acknowledged, to sweep the floor in a section where there were no customers while \"visiting\" with another employee.  Actually, there were only 4 small paries seated in the restaurant. Then she came back & finally seated us, nonchalantly apologizing for the wait. She wanted to take our entire order as she seated us, but we didn't know what we wanted, except for our drinks. Then she disappeared only to return to the 3 top seated behind us...visiting with the young patrons there, as if she knew them. When my wife decided to get up to go to the ladies room, she finally came over to take our order but said she'd return when my wife returned. I said no,  I can order for both of us and did. I ordered the \"snack\" size boneless wings with honey BBQ. My wife's wrap came out okay but my order of 8 boneless wings came out as 6 and labeled as \"1/2 small\" with 6 pieces, not 8 and they were mostly very dry, with little sauce, mostly bare breading showing. She finally came back & I asked her about it. She did get me some sauce & 2 more pieces. I don't usually leave a negative comment on a restaurant's performance but felt compelled after seeing so many employees, lack of patrons and lack of customer service.  Something needs to be done to save BWW's reputation and this franchise... one visit with bad service/food is one thing...3 times is a sign of poor management and/or employees that don't have a clue or care. We hope someone will fix this one and soon...Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings have really good wings but I was not impressed by their service. My roommates and I came Sunday evening to grab dinner and the restaurant was not busy at all. We were seated immediately but we waited about 15 min for our server to come take our drink order. There was plenty of other staff members who could have helped but instead they were all standing in the front just talking with each other.  It would have been nice if the servers helped one another and grabbed drinks for the tables. But I guess the conversation they were having was way more important then serving the customers. Our server was nice but she barely came around to our table. It took forever to get drink refills."}
{"text":"Service was excellent by Jessica & Emily in the bar! Very disappointed that they don't offer anything for our Veteran's, being that it is Memorial Day weekend.. Take care of our Veteran's and I'll give  but only one star for now!!!"}
{"text":"Updating my review. It looks great with the remodel. Food is still great and the service staff is not notch there!!! I recommend the honey bbq boneless wings."}
{"text":"The food is great, the drinks are cold, and the employees are awesome. The GM, Dean, stopped to strike up a conversation because he noticed I was from out of town, and he was such a nice guy. The bartender, Allen, was another really nice guy. Food came out fast, drinks came out fast, how much more can you ask for? I'd definitely come back here next time I'm in Arizona!"}
{"text":"The service at this location is fabulous. Our waitress was quick, funny, and efficient. She checked on us often. The manager checked on us. Passing wait staff asked if we needed anything. Just exceptional service for a busy bar. Our drinks came out quick. Our appetizer was great. And it came out with plenty of time to eat it before our meals arrived. I tried the new street tacos and they were good. I would order those again. I'm so happy we decided to eat at the restaurant instead of to go."}
{"text":"I visited this BW3 a couple weeks ago for a Cavs game that started at 8 p.m.  Met three friends all coming from out of town.  Got there at 6:15 p.m., found a first come first get table for the four of us.  Ordered the large order of wings, fried pickles, medium order of wings, a burger and some other kind of sandwich at 6:25 p.m. Got our couple beers and pops fairly quickly. Table of two that sat down about 6:30 p.m., ordered their food within a few minutes got their food about 6:45 p.m.  I only noticed it because I saw them sit down after us since tables were at a premium.    Didn't worry too much about them getting their food before us.  About 7 p.m. a large table with 10 plus people sat down near us.   Ordered their food and drinks.  At this time we questioned our server asking for an eta for our food.  She said soon. About 7:10 p.m., large table got their many orders of wings and almost all pop (many young kids).  Now we had a real issue. I asked the server again and I can't make her response up if I tried.  \"They ordered smaller orders of wings and we always serve those first before the big orders\". Are you kidding me?   We questioned her thinking we could not have understood her correctly and she repeated it.  We even let her go and flagged down another server and she said the same thing. At this point it was now 7:20, game starts at 8 and we don't want to bring our food in. We told the waitress to please just get our bill for the drinks and cancel the food part and she told us she'd tell the manager.   That's fine, do whatever you want but we're out of here. The manager came over, gave us the bill for the drinks.  Did not apologize for the food.  Would not even address or respond to the policy we were just told.  I swear they just grabbed someone off the street and said we'll give you a free beer if you go over to this table, hand them the bill and don't say anything for five minutes.  It was the strangest experience.  Thought their might even be a hidden camera. After waiting several times for the manager to show any life, I asked him if he thought we should still have to pay the $15 or so for the drink and he finally replied with a \"no\".  Still no apology, still no explanation. We left. Gets better - I asked Suri (sp?) on my iphone for the number of BW-3 the next day.  I wanted to call and question the Twilight Zone episode I just had the night before at the downtown BW-3.   I got a different location so I asked them for the corporate number.  Told them that I had a negative experience a different location.   They got a manager on the phone and told me I had to go to the website to get it.  Customer service at it's best."}
{"text":"Came in here today since 1:30pm to watch my favorite college football team of course USC Trojans. We got here early for the game and got good service although it was busy through the day when our server was busy the manager of the place would stop by and check in on us to see if there was anything else he can do for us. Definitely be back and recommend for all sporting events and or just a good lunch."}

The waitress was nice and polite. The food order was delivered in a timely fashion.  The problem was the food quality and taste. My wife and I ordered wings. With the wings came celery and carrots. The celery had brown ends and the carrots had a \"foreign\" taste to them. I pointed this out to the waitress and she \"sorry\" and did not offer to replace them. The wings were fatty and much hotter than we expected medium to be. No management ever came by and I got the feeling that this restaurant IS NOT CUSTOMER friendly. I wish Hooters would come to Monroe."}
{"text":"There's another Buffalo Wild Wings on Ray and McQueen that is nicer than this one.  When you walk into this location, it has the same feel as an old Denny's.  My party and I stood by the \"wait to be seated\" sign for a few minutes.  Servers walked by and no one acknowledged us.  It was a Sunday night, busy but there were still plenty of empty tables.  One of the people I went there with said they had to use the restroom and asked if we'd order them a beer when we finally got a table.  When he came out of the restroom we were still standing there, unacknowledged.  With plenty of other options to dine nearby, we left."}
{"text":"The newest Buffalo Wild Wings (or BW3 if you can remember them that far back) is located adjacent to the Nascar Hall of Fame.  The location is a bit off the beaten path for \"uptown\" Charlotte.  But, if you are in the Wachovia/Wells Fargo end of town, it is an easy walk.  All the standard BWW fare is here.  Try the Asian Zing sauce- as they say, its where Sweet meets heat.  Street Parking may be a challenge, but ample deck parking is available at the HOF and nearby. Or, ride the light rail in, and walk a couple blocks to the NASCAR HOF."}
{"text":"Cheese curds are good, service was good, big daddy burger was good, more than enough food."}
{"text":"Great place to have wings and watch the game. Staff is real nice and friendly. The only real downside is the odd parking. The whole shopping center has very weird parking. Wing specials are great though and I love their rewards system."}
{"text":"This, I would say, is by far the best BWW I've been to.  First off, it's huge!  So many TV's cover this place plus is very opened up. Some BWW's are separated in rooms this one is much more like one big open room then the bar. The bar is also very open and very big. Almost all the TV's are angled at such a position where you can see everything wherever you're at.  The food and service are much like other BWW's, very friendly, very prompt. I went in on a Monday Night Football game with the Cowboys playing and it was packed. Still, I got my wings and potato wedges before my beer even arrived!  Only suggestion (and this goes out to all BWW's): Make a breaded version of wings like Hooters. It's the only thing missing from your menu."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible customer service. Bad management. The other location on hualapai is much better and the people are actually welcoming and nice. I'm very disappointed. I do not tolerate rude ass employees."}
{"text":"I came one night to order take out since I'm not 21 and it was past 12. The server mike took my order very sweet and great customer service!! Got my friends and I water as we were waiting without us even having to ask! Love Buffalo Wild Wings & their staff! (:"}
{"text":"My favorite one in town. Food could come out a little faster. But love the atmosphere of the strip and sports"}
{"text":"I frequent this location every time I drive to Pittsburgh. They had some 15 guarantee that I didn't know about. The manager politely explained that because the meal took too long it was free. The food was good- but did take longer then we expected for lunch. The 15 minu"}
{"text":"Service was good, lots of TV screens (football games) to choose from.   Food was excellent as usual.  A little crowded but that's too be expected on game day."}
{"text":"I really like the wings, specifically because of the sauce choice. My favorites are Mango Habenero (spicy), Wild (spicy) , Caribbean Jerk (medium) and Teriyaki (mild) Spicy Garlic (medium) is also pretty good.  The chips with cheese and cajun seasoning is delicious.  I almost always sit at the bar and the bartenders are great. Dani and Michelle are my favorites, but the guys on weekend swing and grave are always great too."}
{"text":"This ones isn't as close to my house... but I stop in occasionally when I'm in the area. I usually sit at the bar and Megan always takes great care of me. This one usually has an upbeat vibe. The girls behind the bar are fun. Nothing like take a break from the mall with a tall Blue Moon to take the edge off.  If I'm eating than I really like the chips with cheese and Cajon seasoning. I feel like the quality of the chips has gone down a little bit, not a lot...but there's a small distinction. I still like them. Wings: My favorites in order are: Wild (Spicy), Mango Habanera (spicy), and Teriyaki (mild), Caribbean Jerk (medium), & Spicy Garlic (medium)  But my friend really likes the honey BBQ (mild)  Pro tip: Order the wings crispy (I hate when I forget)  Happy Hour 2pm-7pm and 10pm-6am $3 Drinks (Jack, Captain or Absolute) $3 Domestic Drafts $3 select Appetizers (only time I get the mushrooms)"}
{"text":"Pretty good choice for lunch with the standard chicken choices. Good service and enough tv's to watch all kinds of sports. The only flaws are the entry way is full of pigeon krap and the trash can is over flowing with garbage. Dirty filthy and gaaarooss! Makes you kind of feel lucky if you didn't get hit with bird crap on way in or out!  They empty stores along the same building is kind of depressing too. Just make it inside without getting pooped on and you'll have a good time. Maybe bring an umbrella?"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Buffalo Wild Wings for several years (even worked at one for 3 years), and Jessica is one of the best servers.  She is always extremely friendly, and remembers us when we come back.  Even though we usually only come in for the UFC fights.  No matter how busy the restaurant gets, she always takes good care of us.  Last time we went in she was bartending, and her service was still incredible."}
{"text":"Worst service in the world with 1/2 the tables empty and employees and management that could care less.....avoid!"}
{"text":"My husband & i used to love going to this location! It was so close to our home & usually service past the host stand is great!   I have been a successful server at a fast paced strip restaurant for a while & also a lead host so I understand fully that a busy packed Friday night can be quiet frustrating... There are usually the same two blonde hosts every visit and every time it's the same thing. They always seem to make you feel like you have bothered them! The first time we came in I was roughly 7+ months pregnant and asked for a booth and were told there was none available and were seated at a table in the middle of the insanely crowded floor then right after a couple was seated at a booth right in front. I am very big on forgiving people in the industry as we all get overwhelmed and mess up.    Usually we get a server named Phillip which is outstanding & on the ball at all times! Even whole training a new server he never failed to make sure we had everything we needed!!   After a few more dinners with a few more annoyed eye rolls from the hosts I finally hit my last straw... I had my best friend in town who has had a few bad experiences with bww back home in Cali I promised we would love the service received at this location. So yet again the hosts never let me down. This time one of the blonde was off, we came in and asked for a booth for 4+ a car seat. After waiting 5 minutes the other host (off shift) comes in with a friend (2 PEOPLE) were immediately seated at a booth. While the manager was standing at the front I quietly laughed and said wow they came in way after us! The 2 hosts like deers in headlights quickly & frantically corrected and said that we were there before. The manager even seeing that our name was first on the list made the off shift host get up and give us the table. We thanked him.   The host & our server processed to chat leaning unprofessionally on the front counter while our bar drinks sat waiting until I finally got our attention... Thank goodness for the manager that brought out our food or we might have never received that either... I would love to go back to this location but I'm not sure if I ever will... I would give 1 star but because of our usual server Phillip I will give it 2"}
{"text":"Brand spankin new...   The good: Service was excellent they had 26 servers on staff to help out just incase they were busy. Granted several of those servers will not be employed after a few weeks. You know who they are.   Janine was nice helpful and didn't mind sharing stories while she had no one else to help.   The just ok: The burgers are a nice hunk of meat but are corporately cooked to med well. Which means well by the time it gets to you.   I had the Big jack which has the burger and pulled pork on it. The flavor was great but the burger was done.   Over all the place is nice, set up with a bar on 1/2 and dining room on the other. I could see watching some football here."}
{"text":"So I don't really do reviews I went to go watch ufc 225 here last Saturday great environment but an employee named Juan Hispanic guy slick back hair gave probably best service I've ever received was not only great to me and my girlfriend but with others around him making the overall experience even better and making me want to return to this location so great dude keep it up"}
{"text":"The service here is HORRIBLE.  I know the menu better than most of the employees, they rarely come by the table to check on you, often times I feel ignored, and their food is moderately so-so.  All of the issues I have with this location stem from management.  they are not being accountable and overseeing their operation.  My guess is that they use their position to supplement their dating life.  I have no evidence to support that, but I've seen it a time or two before and this is exactly what it looks like."}
{"text":"I am so happy they opened this place back up after being closed for so long. They have a whole new staff and whole new management team it seems like because they are much nicer than before. The food is awesome. I got the 24 wings, 12 HOTTTT and 12 HOT BBQ, they were amazing. The beer was ice cold and for a Friday night not to bad of a wait, we sat on the patio since it was nice outside."}
{"text":"Come here on opening day and a buddy of mine took on the wing challenge. 12 super flaming wings in 6 minutes. He and a competitor did it in under 4 mins. In fact the guy who won did it in 2 mins and 17 secs.i think we will call him Chris. Anyways the wings are very fresh and the place is as clean as it will ever be. They gave out free wings for a year to the first 100 people on opening day. People spent the night to wait Until 10 am. Crazy , check this place in Monroe we now have a sports bar that is fun to hang out in."}
{"text":"First off, Alex and Brandon were fighting the entire time we were standing by the host stand.  I'm a bartender and I usually don't do this but I am extremely unhappy with what happened when I came in. They were both extremely rude. I understand there's a wait so there is absolutely no need to talk to me like an idiot. They then sat my friends and I in a section that had NO SERVER. Us not knowing, we waited for 25 minutes before anyone came to help us. When we asked a server they scoffed and said \"you were seated in a section that doesn't have a server but I guess I'll take care of you\". Thank you for taking care of us Betsy, but really If you're really trying to not make money off of your service I recommend you trying something other than waiting tables. You took 15 minutes for 3 orders of water, you never checked on us when we got our food and you never refilled any of our waters. When it came to us needing something we asked another team member and they said \"I'll tell your server\" meaning I don't want to do it.  The team work there was awful! When we finally got our checks she mixed our payments up leaving us waiting even longer. She didn't even apologize when we brought it up. Just an \"oh\". The restaurant wasn't even busy and this is how our experience went. Talk about quantity over quality. I don't recommend this location at all!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible costumer service.  Waitress was rude.  She argued with our group about or basketball kids ages and eating off the kids menu they she didn't think they were 12.  Then charged us for adult meals for them and they were actually 7th graders.  We had to get our own waters because after being asked 2 times she still did not give us them.  Our food came out wrong she argued what we ordered.   Took a half hr to deal and fix our bills that were wrong and overcharged.  I will never return to this place.  I spoke with the general manager before I left and she apologized for the service and told me the next time I come she will give me a free meal.  I will never eat that free meal because our family will never return there"}
{"text":"Best BWW in the area. The staff at this location is great! This is always a busy place. They offer seating outdoors or indoors on the restaurant side or at the bar.  I always sat at the bar or outdoors. They have tvs both indoors and out for you to watch the sporting events. The are reasonably priced both in regards to food and alcohol. The wings are the best!  Anytime I am in the area I always stop here to grab a bite to eat and have a drink.  The restaurant side seems to be kid friendly, they have games on both sides. The service is always quick and the food is always hot and prepared as requested."}
{"text":"For this corporate chain, I'll just make some quick hard hitting facts of some of the things that stood out to me at this specific B-Dubs!  My colleagues and I were quickly seated. The layout of the restaurant is nice and spacious with numerous large TVs lining the walls. The servers and bartenders are extremely friendly. They offer electronic trivia. When I asked for an extra side of sauce to go with my boneless wings they complied without charging me. They did however mess up my coworkers 'well-done wings' order, quickly fixed the mistake and comped his meal. If you are a Sriracha fan, they have a new wing sauce you can try dubbed 'Sizzling Sriracha!'  Lastly, they offer two weekly specials: Wing Tuesdays(discounted regular wings) and Boneless Wing Thursdays(60 cent boneless wings).  List of Sauces and Seasonings for your perusing pleasure in descending order of spiciness: Salt & Vinegar Seasoning Sweet BBQ Lemon Pepper Seasoning Teriyaki Mild Parmesan Garlic (*MY FAVORITE!*) Chipotle BBQ Seasoning Medium Honey BBQ Buffalo Seasoning Spicy Garlic Jammin' Jalapeno Sriracha Sizzle (Limited Time Only) Asian Zing Desert Heat Seasoning Caribbean Jerk Thai Curry Hot BBQ Hot Mango Habanero Wild Blazin'"}
{"text":"Worst management of all time! Terrible service this place is great if you enjoy getting ripped off.   Had a to-go call ahead order that was 30 minutes late. That's fine. I understand shit happens. But when I asked if they could give me a beer on the house while I wait, they said there was nothing they could do.   What a joke! Terrible management. I will not be going back ever again."}
{"text":"Came here after work yesterday morning. That's one good thing about BW3 in Vegas compared to home... 24 hours! I was the only one in there with 2 other guys. Got some naked tenders and a veggie boat to go while I caught up on Sportscenter. Honey BBQ and medium sauce are the way to go! Great spot for game watching any time."}
{"text":"DO NOT come here on a Tuesday or Thursday food is not as good as any other day.  I recommend kickin honey garlic wings."}
{"text":"I come to this location cause its the closest to me. But this is one of the busier locations so be prepared to wait more than an hour on a busy night. The service is good and obviously the food is great!"}
{"text":"Wings are good like always but the service here isn't all that great. The waiters and waitresses are basically just standing around talking to each other. We didn't even get refills for our drinks or anything. Also the waitress brought out our food, walked around with it not knowing which table to bring it out to, then she goes back into the kitchen and brings it back out to us. Again, food is good but please work on your customer service."}
{"text":"We have been here quite a few times and their service has always been amazing, doesn't matter how busy or empty it is. They do unbreaded wings and they have decent wing flavours. Tuesdays are half priced wings and a perfect time to stuff our face with all that fried meet.  Mango Habanero and Hot honey Garlic are our favourite flavours out of the ones they offer but they could really do with some intense hot flavours; blazing and wild aren't that hot and thats the only thing lacking here. Their dry wings are quite nice as well."}
{"text":"Took the kids out for some wings on a Saturday night.  Place was decently packed, but there were tables open (before 6:00).  Despite this, food was a little slow coming out of the kitchen.  The food is decent pub grub, and they have a decent selection of draft beers (a few micros mixed in)."}
{"text":"Arguably the best restaurant to hit up in the 480. Always fast service and always bomb wings. I've never once had a complaint."}
{"text":"If it were not for the atmosphere and entertainment options, BWW would be out of business.  I will admit it is a very fun place to get a beer and watch a game.  My wife and I also enjoy the game options the provide while you eat.  But that is the only good of this place.  The food is so mediocre it is mind blowing.  If you have \"wings\" in your name, I expect you to have at least above average wings.  I can and have made better tasting wings in my oven than you get at BWW.  They are never crispy and I have never had a sauce that has impressed me.  On top of that, the ranch tastes like bottled ranch.  They are the same whether you go regular or boneless wings.  I won't go as far as to say they are bad.  If I have the choice between tysons frozen wings and BWW, i'll probably choose BWW.  However, the difference is not very substantial.  Other than the wings, their sandwiches and the rest of the food is also nothing more than average.  They do have good appetizers, and the potatoe wedges are delicious.  Stick to beers and apps unless you enjoy bad food."}
{"text":"Wtf... BW's has lost their touch. The one on the strip by the outlets was terrible last time but they were busy so I gave them another chance.. Big mistake. I ordered from this Durango location today for lunch, and I got a burger with old lettuce, and Mac n cheese that had barley any actual cheese on it. I am highly disappointed!  won't be getting any food from ANY of the Vegas locations again..."}
{"text":"Hubby and I get takeout a lot here. They always seem to be very busy when we come here but they always have our food ready and great customer service!"}
{"text":"I had take out at this place. The service was great. The person at the register was friendly. I came in on time from when pick up said it would be ready. I waited about five min to get my order. She told me she would go over my order once it's ready but she didn't.  I should've insisted on going over the order because the quality of food was way below bad. The wings were mostly bread and little chicken. They were over cooked. And the worst part was it had very little to no sauce. One of the Parmesan Garlic box that I got had almost no sauce it in that it was like eating chicken nuggets. It was so dry.  I do not recommend coming to this place. Maybe try a different Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Oh man I have a mixed review. We came here for game 6 of Lakers vs Suns.  It's cool that there's lots of big tv's showing all sports. The vibe is cool, loud n fun. We sat at the bar and the bartenders r cool and nice. But daym...I'm starving!!   We ordered our wings during the first quarter and now we are on the fourth quarter and nothing. The food didn't come and the bartender checked with the waitress three times. But every time the bartender asked the waitress, the waitress shook her head, I dont know if that meant no, she hasn't checked it or no, it's not ready. What?don't they have tons of wings back there? Like thousands and they can't find 25 pcs of wings for us? Ridiculoid!! We ended up cancelling our order during the last 5 minutes of the 4th quarter. What chaps my hide is there is no empathy and although we spent lots on beer, there was no \"hey sorry for the missing wings order, here's a glass of beer on us\". Nothing for our miserable wait...nada.  Everyone else gettin their wings except for us. Man, we also had slow slow service in the Torrance location, 1hour wait for 25 pcs. And here too? Im trying to give BWW a chance but it can't redeem itself. It would have been nice to be munching on some wings with the beers but whatever. Never again.  We are so hungry that we are going next door to Cane's...that actually is great which I will post in another review."}
{"text":"Where did the customer service go? Our server came to give us waters but left after that. It took about 20 minutes for someone to come and take our orders (we had to flag someone down). Once we ordered, it took another 30 minutes to get our food out, which is unusually long considering what our party of 3 ordered. Alongside that, I never had a refill of water the entire time. I tried to again, flag someone down for more water but no one came the entire time, only to bring us our checks."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Food took over 20 minutes, we ordered an appetizer and never got it. When addressed with the server, all she said was \"I don't know what happened but you won't be charged\" all I could think was \"well thank you for not charging me for a product I never got!\" I was starving upon coming in here and was let down. I usually go to Native Grill on the other side of the freeway but wanted to give this place a chance.   I'll probably stick to going there.  I honestly think the server in the bar area had too much more than she could actually handle.   On the plus side they had several tv's. And all the sports games on everywhere, my drink came to me cold.  One more thing, it was super uncomfortably cold.  We were also in during happy hour. I do like their happy hour specials.  No manager ever stopped by either.  10.29.15"}
{"text":"Went to pick up my takeout order and was extremely disappointed to find no ranch or blue cheese in the bag. If you've ever had buffalo wings you would know that's completely unacceptable. For a brief moment I thought I was in North Korea. Not sure if I'm going to be able to shake off this disappointment. I don't want an apology I just want them to be better!"}
{"text":"As far as these places go, this one is pretty nice. Mainly because the bar area is almost completely separated from the main dinging area. All the crazy, shouting sports fans don't scare the little kids munching on their boneless wings.  The bar is nice and big, which I LURRRVE. There is nothing (well, almost nothing) I hate more then walking into a place where most of the seats are taken up, so you have to stand there like a douche, head up in the air, looking like a lost puppy as you try to find an empty bar stool. I definitely liked the GINORMOUS projection screens they have there. Not a bad seat in the house, really.  The bartenders were nice, but never printed out my receipt and put it into a lowball glass like they usually do. Not a big deal though.  Yet again, no Michelob Golden Draft Lite :( So far, I have found no place in Las Vegas sells it. Makes me sad."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful experience here most of the times I went. Food is medicorce, barely even worth the price it is, it's always so loud (but that's my fault for choosing this place because that's the atmosphere) , and it's just not great service. Nothing special about BDubs, but it's wings, so if you like wings, especially mediocre ones, come here. Nothing too special, but Wingstop and VooDoo Wings have better wings for a better, more deserving price."}
{"text":"Aghhh...BW in Norterra....this is exciting stuff!! I live right by here so no more driving all the way to scottsdale...cool servers..best boneless wings...this is the place to be with your buddies during a fight, sport game or just to sit down and shoot the shit."}
{"text":"Two trips to this place: one OK and the other not great at all.  The result? A two-star average over those visits.  First time I stopped by with a friend, who ordered a variety of wings and some fries while I had the buffalo wrap with fries.  It was quite tasty and the wings were good. Decent fries too.    The second visit was where things went to crap.  A group of us stopped in for a quick late lunch that was anything but.  Upon entry and asking for a booth, the hostess marched us straight back to a booth near the toilets despite a number of open booths elsewhere in the facility.  Not only is this booth near the toilets it had the worst viewing area for the numerous college football games being shown.  She then took off before we could ask to move.  Fortunately our waitress let us move, but as we walked over to a much nicer booth the hostess who seated us was starring daggers at us.  If looks could kill we'd all be dust.  We then had a bunch of wings, some fries, and I had a buffalo chicken sandwich (grilled).  The chicken sandwich was disgusting, really chewy with lots of tendon in it and barely hot.  The dry rub buffalo wings were ok, as were the fries, but the Caribbean jerk wings were way way too sweet.  Service was ok to start, with a couple of drink refills and the food coming out quick, but our waitress kinda vanished after that and it took forever to get our bill.   Overall, the first visit was probably three and a half stars and this visit was (being generous) one and a half stars.  I'll average that out to two stars and, given the last experience, I doubt we'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"For some reason my son LOVES the kid's burger here; it's the only place where he actually eats his burger before his fries - and for a 3 year old, that's some magic!  We prefer this location over the one at Elliot & McQueen - the service is a little better and I like the layout.  It's especially good if we can get the couches to lounge on.  I wouldn't call this a real sports bar, but it definitely tries with several TVs and a big screen.  But for me, it's just too tame to attract any hardcore sports fans.  For what it is, though, it's good - a place where I can watch an hour of the game while my son and I enjoy some all-American grub.  The wings are decent, I don't recommend the nachos, but I really like the mini corndogs.  The service is friendly and although I find the surcharge for ranch or extra sauce completely ridiculous, I can put up with it for some family fun."}
{"text":"Oh my... Had read the reviews but decided to venture out to this Uptown Charlotte location because a) it was across the street from my hotel and b) I'd driven 550 miles today and didn't feel like going any further than across the street from my hotel.  The food -- street tacos and fried pickles appetizers -- we're very good.  The IPA selection was way above average (Ballast Point Sculpin, Lagunitas, Elysium, Stone), but pursuant to the majority of previous reviews, the service was severely lacking.  They brought my foot, they brought my beers, but there was no personal interaction, no, um, service.  I had to call out to engage the bartender, and I was close enough to overhear the two bartenders complaining about another group of customers on the other side of the bar.  Pretty unpleasant as a new patron.    Don't expect good service, and the food and drink will exceed expectation."}
{"text":"Service sucked and I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and it was all lettuce just HORRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"18% gratuity on a $7.95 drink? Waitress didn't ask if I wanted any other drinks or come back to ask if I wanted anything to eat after I said not yet when first asked. Not the best experience this time. Oh! And the waitress kept the change from the $10 I paid for my ONE DRINK. disappointed.......very disappointed."}
{"text":"Go to Winking Lizard.   Service was poor, food was lackluster. We had an order come out wrong (it was inputted incorrectly), and the server who delivered it tried to convince us it was right. We got another server to take the food back and put in the correct order. By the time the correct order came back, the rest of us were done.  At any decent restaurant (e.g. Winking Lizard) a manager would volunteer to deal with this in some way - no charge for the food or comping one of the beers. I've been in this situation before, and I return to restaurants that do their best to right their wrongs. Instead, we were informed by the server that nothing could be done because we ate the food (that arrived 25 minutes late). The manager similarly argued that he couldn't do anything because we ate it. He ultimately agreed to a discount on the single food item, but he was surly about it - no one from the restaurant owned their mistake.  In short, eat local, and keep these kind of chains that care more about the bottom line than their patrons out of our neighborhood.   I suggest Winking Lizard."}
{"text":"Worst hostess service ever!! We walked in and everyone was cramped up in there small waiting area. My husband told the hostess it was 2 of us and she \"wrote\" his name...well we thought she did, but we were skipped twice. They seated people first that got there after us. We ended up walking out!!!! Never going back to this location!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday for the UFC200 fight. Best service ever! Good food , cold beer considering I was there for 8 hours. Most definitely will Return again"}
{"text":"Desert Heat wing dry rub seasoning with onion rings and two bottles of Strongbow. The medium size is meant for sharing. The server was great even under pre hockey match duress. This is a good bww with outdoor seating. It is unreasonably loud like all the others."}
{"text":"Service continues to get better, however as I make my way through the menu it becomes more hit and miss than my original review.  Their burgers are weak and limp, and the quality of their chicken breasts is average at best. The wings have also been a little overcooked lately.  That being said it's still a great place to eat and the service has been so good lately. Just wanted to update my original 5 stars down to 4 to reflect a couple of weak points on an otherwise good place to go."}
{"text":"Where to begin... this place used to be so great!  We went to BWW at Westgate after the Cardinals Red & White practice. We got there about 6:15 and put our name on the list. There was a lot of empty tables so we figured it couldn't be more than a five minute wait. I asked how long it would be and I was told that there was no way to tell as there was a UFC fight going on and people may not be leaving. OK, but what about the empty tables?!?   We took the kids around the corner to Just Sports and browsed for a few minutes then went back to BWW at 6:30. After standing there in the crowded entry way for ten minutes my 12 year old son noticed a lot of empty tables. He went up to the counter and asked why we couldn't sit at the open booth on the west side of the floor. Then we were immediately seated in that booth. So we got a table at 6:45, 30 minutes after we signed in and with still a lot of open tables.  We ordered drinks and some appetizers because at this point we were all starving.  We were delighted to hear that they could make naked potato skins for my son who has life threatening peanut, dairy and beef allergies. We asked our server to make sure that they didn't use peanut oil to fry and he checked and found out they use BEEF TALLOW to fry their food. Bummer for my son as that now ruled out pretty much everything he could eat. I understand that beef tallow is cheaper than a lot of other oils but it's just surprising to me that a business would use an oils like this when there are other pure oils that could be used. At any rate, my son ended up ordering mandarin oranges and naked chicken tenders.   Fast forward to 7:45... we sat there waiting for our meal, an hour after we got there. Thankfully BWW has these little tablet devices the kids can play games on so we were able to avoid any meltdowns from our 10 and 12 year old. At one point our 12 year old said \"doesn't waiting this long defeat the purpose of going out?\" Ummm yeah.  We finally got our food around 8, after having a chat with the food service manager. I have to point out that the ONLY reason we gave this location two stars is because our server, Tristain, and the food service manager, Melissa were outstanding when it came time to resolve our issues. Shortly after getting our complaint, Melissa had our food on the table. Everything came out fine but it was all such a debacle.  BWW has a great location here. They just need to get a grip on their service. They used to be really good and getting people in and out but if they can't handle the crowd after a Cardinals practice I have no idea how they are going to get through the demand during football season. They have a five star location with one star service right now."}
{"text":"We met some friends here for wings and drinks.  My first Margarita was pretty good, good flavor and kinda strong.  The gf and I shared wings, half Sweet BBQ, half Spicy Garlic?.  I thought the BBQ were ok but I didn't like the garlic wings at all.  They were served with the usual ranch (or blue cheese) dressing, and carrots and celery (or fries).  I just thought they were WAY OVER COOKED.  They were dry inside, and the only thing saving them was the sauce on the exterior.  My second drink was a joke.  I sent it back and it was still terrible.  It tasted like stale mix.  GROSS.  The waitress must have been on her rag cuz she was a B.  She didnt even say sorry about the drink, she just kinda grabbed it out of my hand before I even finished my sentence.    Her tip matched her attitude. :o)  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went to this location tonight. Where our food was cold and took forever to come out. I couldn't even eat my wings the medium was too hot and the wings and fries were literally ice cold. This isn't the first bad experience I've at this location but it is definitely the last. Thanks for wasting my time and $35 bucks."}
{"text":"Great wings-  I like the traditional style with the mild sauce.  Skip the ribs- its not what they do.  Great selection of games being shown in the dining area.  Open till 2am."}
{"text":"Fun sports bar are the words that first come to mind when I think of Buffalo Wild Wings.  They offer something for those who are into trivia games as well as those who enjoy watching sports.  When ordering I layer my order because the food comes up quickly, so I often order my main course upon receiving the appetizer.  Garlic Parmesan wings are fantastic as are their walking tacos, I don't think I've had a bad dish here."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar, really like the garlic parm sauce on wings (they do put it on heavy, which I like) if you like to eat your food warm, don't order it until you finish eating your app...as many years as I've come here, they bring your food out almost immediately after serving the app and the app is either wasted or my food gets cold...I've learned that I have to pace the servers myself...and plan on waiting to pay, the servers will bring your bill you can take a long winters nap and need a shave and a haircut by the time they return to pick it up...(slow or busy times, at least they are consistent)  Food is typically good."}
{"text":"We have been to this place a couple times and every single time they are SO slow!! There's always a wait even with lots of open tables and the servers are nice but cover too many tables & the hostess also busses all the tables! The food is ok- up to 30 min for it to come out & kinda overpriced for mediocre bar food- $35 for 2 adults & a child without any alcohol- I even had water! This could be a fun place to hang out - instead it's just a letdown every time. The manager needs to get a clue how to run the place- hire more people or learn to be more efficient! Another customer lost....disappointing at best."}
{"text":"Awsome restaurant! I've been to many other BWW's and I don't think we've ever receive great service like we did this time. All thanks to Joe for the AWSOME service.  He would constantly check on us and it's pretty surprising because it doesn't happen a lot at the other locations I've been too. Thank you Joe! Coming from Los Angeles, CA. I'll be coming back here too."}
{"text":"ZERO!!!! The food is extremely the lowest quality. The wings are as large as a chicken leg... obviously injected with fatty hormones. ..i  don't trust this place passing any health inspection. .. Very dirty as well. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I have two bad experiences with this location in the past 2 weeks.  The first was with a catering order I placed.  Placed the order on a Thursday night to be picked up on Saturday at 2:30.  Went to pick up the order and they didn't have it. They \"lost\" the order.  It was a joke.  Then just went to lunch there today and got a plate of boneless wings that were presented very badly...sorry but I don't want my hot flavored wings touching my not spicy wings.   This store needs some work."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Ok for a couple beers. Slow service. The honey mustard wings look like baby crap & the taste isn't much different. Wings were also cold. If you get a salad don't bother asking for balsamic vinaigrette...they're trying to pass off Italian for balsamic."}
{"text":"We walked in asked for a booth for 4 there are more than 5 booths open they sat us at a table. The bathrooms are disgusting. My little sister asked what lemonades they had and our server told us just regular then she looked at the menu and there were many different lemonade options. This is all within just 5 minutes of coming in. Who knows what will happen the rest of our time here."}
{"text":"This place really went to s***t!! Food took forever to come out and my queso had a skin on it from sitting under the hot lamp so long. My friend's fried pickles came out a big fried ball of mess with a pool of oil in the bottom of the basket, and there was wads of uncooked batter in the middle of the ball. An hour later our wings came out, all cold. We payed for our half foam beers and left. Server was rude when we expressed our concern over the cold food. Do not visit this location!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what has gone amiss w/ BWW, the ambiance has gone downhill recently.  Upon being seated I counted  5 unbussed tables in our immediate area (ok I get it, maybe those 5 parties all left at the same time just before I walked in).  What gets me is when we got up to leave of the 5 tables 3 were partially bussed and 2 remained untouched).  The establishment didn't look 1/2 full and eating while being surrounded by dirty tables didn't make a pleasant experience.  In addition the floor areas appeared dirty and unkept (napkins on floor which appeared to not being taken care of).  I give an extra star as the server did a good job at serving us (I wonder if that person was thinking job hunting sites..).  The food was so so.. Wings will obviously exceed your salt/sodium quota for the day, ranch dressing had an off flavor as it tasted different from my previous visits).  It will be a lonnng time before I return I'll be exploring other options in the area.."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service! Husband baby and I went on veterans day so it was packed and they sat us right away and served us immediately. Baby was acting up and we asked for the check, they were able to get us out the door quickly. All of the staff was super nice and great help. Food was spot on!"}
{"text":"Our waitress did not come help us until half an hour after we were seated and did not even apologize. The hostess had to get our drinks and tell the waitress to come take our order."}
{"text":"Experience was subpar - bartender was attentive and friendly - but food was mediocre and manager was miserable. Ordered a grilled chicken burger which arrived with a burnt bun and hardly any sauce. The bartender was quick to get the issue fixed. Her manager, however, appeared not to care and mentioned that he was \"surprised someone didn't like a charcoal-ed bun\" and offered no apology. Traveled here on work, so I don't have to worry about returning; but would caution others."}
{"text":"Wings on point. I ordered take out and it was very fast and efficient. Only thing I'd complain about is the guy taking my order. He did not give me time to just say what I want to have ordered. Keep rushing me! But other than that everything else is good! You win some you lose some! I guess as long as the food tastes great.... :P"}
{"text":"Been here a few times when i come to vegas. Its an alright location, service has been ehhh and the food was also ehhh. The service was ok even though it was half empty. Lots of workers on their phones or taking selfies not paying attention to tables. Unsanitary.... seen girls fix their hair while handling food. But bww is always fun."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst experience I've ever had. When we arrived it took them around 10 minutes to seat us, which was irritating considering they weren't busy and there were clearly tables open and servers standing around. When we sat down, our waitress explained that she was new and had only been working for a few days. She was clearly a little nervous which was understandable. However,when our food came out, one of our orders was missing. She said she would go check on it, and never came back. Clearly she forgot to ring it in, and 20 minutes later our order came out. This is a lack of training on this locations part and we will not be back. The only reason why I gave it two stars is because the waitress was sweet and apologetic and the manager was professional."}
{"text":"I will give this location a good rating as the service is always decent.  They are great with kids and its a nice loud place where we can dine with them.  The specialty wing flavors are also very creative.  My only concern with BWW's is that the prices are kind of high for wings and the sandwiches are a better deal."}
{"text":"the food takes a long time and it's overpriced, but definitely is always consistent with the delicious food. great place to watch a game"}
{"text":"Worst BWW that could possibly exist!  Came in and put my name on the list saw a couple people waiting so I asked how long the wait was the servers response was exact words \"i don't know\" okay I sat down and waited... 5 mins... 10 mins.. I could see empty tables by the front but just kept waiting..  Finally we get seated.. Dirty booth there is food on the seat and water on the table and I didn't even dare to look under the table.. 10 minutes go by and nobody even acknowledges us. After 15 minutes of us being ignored and the table who was seated after us had already ordered I was very annoyed so we got up and left..  Extremely dirty place & 0 customer service skills from anybody in this place. Don't waste your time coming to this BWW"}
{"text":"Excellent service....drinks full the whole meal, suggestions for a new sauce when i didn't like the one i ordered, with no hesitation....good food too. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"good place to be after a long day at  work to eat and have a couple of drinks. Good food ,good people. Only down side is that theres a 30 minute wait most of the time"}
{"text":"Make sure you keep on top of them over your place in the seating arrangement. We had a party of 7 and never got called. Wasted 45min of our time. We had to go to another restaurant. They should have a speaker or a buzzer system."}
{"text":"Do I have to say Buffalo wild wings are the  best for hot wings ? I don't think so they name says it all also the tortilla soup was great  and I will just come back because of the service good job Buffalo Wild Wings!!!"}
{"text":"We tried BWW another time hoping they had worked out the bugs of a new location. They still haven't. I ordered nachos and they were the worst nachos I have ever had. It didn't even look like they tried to make it edible. Will not go back. Give up and won't give them any more money while they try to get it together."}
{"text":"I tell myself to stop coming here due to never being really impressed but I enjoy the television viewing options and keep thinking the food will taste better. Nope, I was wrong again and again and again. Today's experience also included a dash of disappointing service as well.   Friends and I stopped by to catch some Thursday night football. We were seated quickly and all was off to a good start. We had a round of the boneless bourbon and mango habanero wings. The wings came out and some were coated and others lacked much sauce. The wings tasted okay. Bourbon not such a fan but the mango were pretty good. For dinner, I had the Big daddy burger and was told it was a popular item. I was really hoping for quality but it was a bust. The patty seemed like what you would get in a junior high cafeteria.  The pork on top was flavorless and it just fell flat in my book. The fries that accompanied the burger were good. Again, another average at best food experience.  To top off our dining experience, the service was on par with the food. Our waitress took our order, delivered and then disappeared. In the span of an entire football game I was given one refill. ONE!!! I kept waiting and waiting and waiting. Finally, she arrived near the end of the game with our bills and we just left. I will not make the mistake of going here again. Lesson learned. Sadly it took three visits to figure it out."}
{"text":"your classic sports bar setting. I come here every Thursday for the boneless wings for $0.75 a piece. They've got a good variety of tasty wing sauces, good beers on tab and TVs everywhere showing different games.  Only downside is that the wings are usually over battered and over fried. So they tend to be hard to chew through at times but you do occasionally get the good pieces. If you go in the afternoon they're rarely busy but the night time they are packed."}
{"text":"Count your wings!  Ordered 40 wings and received 35 plus one scary boneless wing.  All this after waiting too long and being served tepid wings.  Asked for 6 medium wings to  cover the ones we did not receive and the odd one.  Received 5 sweet bbq wings.  I give up...you should too!"}
{"text":"Everyone who works here always works hard especially on Game Day, every server I've had always tries to satisfy me and the rest of the tables it's great  I love it here I would definitely recommend anybody to come here!"}
{"text":"Did my fantasy draft here. We were more disturbing than anyone else. I forgot about wing Tuesday's and paid a lot less than I thought!!  Crista was nice, quick and lovely. Come here for your draft picks! You get a board, trophy and it's fun!!!"}
{"text":"Okay so I'm just gonna keep this review short. Either the service is really good or it really sucks! There hasn't been a between for me.   I ate here a couple weeks ago and my boneless wings literally tasted like dirty dish water. I'm not a picky eater but I couldn't handle them and had to send them back for new ones. It was cold and chewy and tasted like they sat in a sink for awhile. So strange. The new ones came out much better and tasted like chicken not a sink. Lol"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. First of all this company's political leanings aside, my son wanted to come here for his 17th birthday so I obliged even though I would normally not even park in the same lot as a BWW.   We were a table of 10 and they assign a server on his 2nd day. Food took forever. All orders but 1 were incorrect. Most orders were cold.   Spoke to a manger and she offered to get us drink refills!   When our cold boneless wings came back, they were still cold and now hard as a rock.   Stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch sports, they have multiple games going on at one time . So whatever game you want to watch it's more than likely on. It's also a great place for friends and family to get together."}
{"text":"Absolute worst experience of my life at a restaurant. My server was very slow getting us our things and not a very smart girl. She took about 10 min to greet us. Then our waters took about another 10 min. We ordered lunch right away because we were in a hurry and I specified 3 times to her that I wanted my quesadilla plain to which she replied \"I got it, no problem\". Well about 25 maybe 30 minutes go by and we finally get our food. Yes you guessed it! Pico de gallo was all over and inside my quesadilla. I am allergic to tomatoes so of course I asked for a new one. She then blamed it on the cooks which I know wasn't true because she simply had too many parties and probably just forgot. She then brings me out my new quesadilla and it's delicious but that also took another 15-20 min. At this point my friend is done with her meal and needs to leave. So I scarfed my food and we got ready to pay. We split the bill of course and my friend paid cash. I paid with a card and everything was dandy. Until I got home and checked my bank account. My lovely server charged my card for both of our meals and didn't even mention to me that she did that. This missing money from my account was a complete surprise later when I was going through my bank account.  1st off can someone please explain to me why I even paid for my meal that took 45 min to get?  2nd, why didn't a manager or my server mention to me that they over charged my card? I am now out that money.  So thanks BWW I will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"Last 3 times we ordered food to go. The order has been completely wrong. Tired of the bad service."}
{"text":"My 5 stars is for the fact that I passed by the location last night and THEY ARE RE-OPENING!!!  No word on when...but there is evidence outside that they are already working on it and the sign just says \"OPENING SOON!\"  Thank goodness!!!!  The food may not be the greatest, but this place became a favorite hangout and \"neighborhood watering hole\" for friends and I! Not many sports bars like this in the West Valley.  I no longer have to have a moment of silence and \"pour one out for the homies\" every time I pass by! Now I can smile and start the countdown to OPENING DAY! Hope it's just in time for football season!"}
{"text":"Down to the facts.  1. After 30 min, they said they were out of brats to a few people at our table and had them re-order. 2. Their new order came out before our original order 3. Turns out they weren't out of brats later on. 4. Then finally everyone's food came out. 5. 1 and a half hours from sit down to actually getting our food.  Meanwhile, a bunch staff stood in the front chatting the entire time."}
{"text":"This BWW has done better than the other ones. Food came promptly and the waitress was competent. Of course, it was the slow time with barely anyone there so they better have done better. At the other BWW, service really drops when they are at half capacity or more.  Come here for wings and choose your sauce. I like the non-spicy Garlic Parmesan sauce."}
{"text":"The happy hour was good on the drinks and appetizers for $3. And during happy hour, the boneless wings were 60 cents. But that's probably the highlight of the place when it came to wings!  The rest of the wings were pricey. Around $6 for 5 wings? Really? Yes I know you have sauces (let me tell it's pretty mediocre) and you have the giant TVs but I can't really seeing myself paying for that much for wings.  I would go there for the $3 menu and 60 cent boneless if you are into the boneless stuff. Go somewhere else for tastier and cheaper wings."}
{"text":"maybe we ordered the wrong things.... 12 boneless, nachos & a black & blue burger.  burger was ok. boneless chicken was like the frozen stuff you buy out of the grocery stores, bleh! and my nachos would have been ok if it was prepared as I asked!  it was a to go order so I asked them to separate the wet toppings on the side for me so I could put it on when we got home so it wasn't mushy... we had mushy nachos. gross.  the were generous w/ the military discount tho I'm not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant about going here,  because it just seemed like it would be lame, but what the hell, sometimes you just want bar food and this is THE ultimate bar food.  I mean who doesn't like wings w/ a HUGE variety of dipping sauces? Sometimes a few brewskis and some wings is JUST what hits the spot.  So get your nose out of the air and go get some wings!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go on a Tuesday. Who says it has to be taco Tuesday when you have wing Tuesday's! So far, the service is great and the chicken wings are good. What a better way to do it, by washing it down with cold beer. You really can't beat half off wings. It gets pretty busy, so expect to wait, or if you don't want to wait, order to go. My favorite is the garlic parmesan. Look out for the special flavors they have in the menu too! They always have seasonal flavors. If you like your wings extra saucey, ask for them extra wet! It's worth the flavor blast."}
{"text":"Great wings. Terrible service bunch of slow and sad staff. No smile no eagerness to serve n earn a tip. Always disappointed on the staff."}
{"text":"This branch is a hit and miss on service. Wings though is always spot on. I always order the Asian Zing. Has spice but doesn't overpower the flavor. The first time I went here, service was awesome. If only I knew our server's name I would gladly recommend him. My recent visit for a To Go was not that great. The girl taking my order kept flirting with this random dude that didn't even eat there (They were conversing a couple of feet away from me). I would not mind it if there weren't customers popping in every couple of minutes. And the hostess (6 oclock something shift on a tuesday night) has the enthusiasm of a sick baby. Plus my to go order took, no joke, 28 minutes to be out, when she swore it'll be just 15. Oh well, hit and miss I tell ya. Will go here ONLY if I crave their wings. But for a chill go to spot, nah, i'll pass."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice, both this year and last year during Labor Day weekend to do a fantasy football draft party done with my cousin. The staff and manager are all really nice.  I love how they have a few local beer brands (didn't carry SanTan but had Four Peaks and Desert Rose).   I do wish they still had the fish tacos available, but had the veggie burger this past time which was still tasty."}
{"text":"This place doesn't always impress me. One thing I liked about them is the traditional wing special that had on Tuesdays each week. I haven't been in some time but when I went back this past Tuesday, I realized they no longer had that special! I thought this was a long standing deal that was offered and, really the reason I even went. I came to find out that they no longer offer it and was forced to order boneless wings if I wanted any kind of deal for the night.  I will say their Teriyaki wing sauce is one of my favorites and I did order that with my boneless wings making them a little more bearable.  I think they price their craft beers at a considerably higher rate than most places. My friend ordered a craft IPA and paid $6.25. You can find a QUALITY craft IPA for about $6 or less elsewhere.  Overall my experience wasn't all to great but I knew what I was walking into when I chose this establishment."}
{"text":"The only thing this place is consistent about is the quality of wings that come out of that kitchen. Every time I've been in there (4th time now), my wings look like they've been sitting out in open air before they've been cooked. They're extremely dried out to the point where the skin is hard.   Management has made their efforts to alleviate the problems, but always come up short as the re-made wings are just as bad. Kitchen staff needs some training, or just needs new staff.   I won't be returning to this location as I've given too many chances."}
{"text":"After striking out at Victory Cafe down the street I quickly went to my Yelp app at searched out my closest Bdubs, with luck it was only minutes away.  We were seated immediately at the bar with access to 6 big screens showing 6 different football games.  My server was really cool about refilling my pop every 15 minutes and ensured me it was no trouble at all. I was kinda bummed I already had a shitty appetizer at Victory Cafe and didn't have room for some bomb ass wings.  The crowd at Bdubs made the experience even better, all kinds of fans sporting there favorite teams jerseys.  By the time we left there was a crowd lined up the door for the 1 o' clock games.  My only regret is that I didn't start here, Man. Good Job Ddubs, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Been to this B-Dubs multiple times and have never had a good experience. Best one we had was at the NCAA National Championship Basketball game. Jalapeño poppers were delicious but warm beers, a couple poured way short, shots poured halfway put a sour taste in my mouth especially after spending over $80. Another visit was with a party of 6, four of us ordered draught beers, girlfriend ordered a bottled beer and our other friend ordered a mixed drink. Half the drinks show up so we order appetizers and entrées. Entrées show up first, missing my girlfriend's wings, one of our friends' was completely incorrect. I told our waitress (completely inattentive) and she grabs the manager. I work in food as a GM, so I tell him the situation and he looks at me like I'm crazy. Long story short he did not comp my girlfriend's food that never showed up, the drinks we didn't get, and argued with me when I approached him about it before we left."}
{"text":"I come to BWW place often. It is right next to my house and sometimes my friends and I just want a quick drink or some food. However, I have no idea why we continue to go to this place and put ourselves through this torture. The service is always TERRIBLE. Tonight I finally decided to write a review. As always, we were seated right away. The hostess/ hosts are always polite and quick to seat us. Once seated, we waited 25 minutes until being greeted by a server. TWENTY. FIVE. MINUTES. Multiple servers walked right by us during that time but they ALWAYS ignored us despite me trying to make eye contact. Finally, we were greeted by Andre I believe his name was. He was very sweet and told us that there was some confusion with servers getting cut and passing on their tables. I would totally understand, if this wasn't the third time I've heard this! We didn't order any food and just wanted drinks. They came quickly and our server was nice and attentive after that. Nothing was wrong with him and his service. However, this is the umptieth time I've come and we ALWAYS wait forever! Slowest service ever. Unless you have hours to waste, I would avoid this place unfortunately."}
{"text":"The food is good. Nice place. Friendly staff. We went there on a Monday morning 4am they did not honor the $4 Happy Hour tacos or beer. They consider it Sunday. Not a good way to do business."}
{"text":"i oredered take out the other night, and they forgot to include the ranch and celery. Thanksfully i had some at home, but it's not the point. Over the years, BWW has gone downhill, and this location is no exception."}
{"text":"We came on a tuesday night, place was chill not too busy. It looked clean, they have lots of tvs playing different things.  We ordered chicken BBQ hot wings and the order took forever, but when it finally arrived it was sooo good, probably one of the best wings i've ever had. So worth the wait, but... the service sucked. The waitress was so blah she couldn't care any less. The same people at the host stand, they were just uninviting.  Food was really good but i wouldn't go back, too snobby for Vegas, way too many places around there to eat at. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I really don't see why the reviews on here are so low. I go to this particular BWW's at least once a week, if not more, because of the great service and food. Tonight They were packed but we got our food and drinks at a normal rate. But the greatest part was Brylee! She was the guest experience person tonight & she was on top of her shit. Some douche kabob kept yelling for the TV that multiple tables (mine included) to be switched to hockey, although we were watching football. So they change it to hockey, we get pissed and ask them to change it back. This douche is yelling at us, the bartenders & waitresses. But Brylee went around to each table and asked what we wanted to watch & what TVs it would be on. She was great & it was awesome the bdubs has someone like her come around to make sure everyone has their game on."}
{"text":"My kids and I stopped for lunch on Sunday after the renovation.  I think they forgot about the bathroom, FILTHY!!  I Went into the men's bathroom only to gag on an extremely high chemical smell that burned my throat.  I couldn't take it and told my son to wait till we get someplace else to clean up.  Good thing cause my throat is on fire today."}
{"text":"Terrible bar service.   I was sitting at the bar and they are serving others before me. I've been here before and it's happen twice now. At least once they apologized.  This times he basically said I was wrong.   The customer was wrong.   Really?   First time I heard that one.   Done with them."}
{"text":"After ordering wings, I explain I got all shanks,  what the bartender calls flats.   She says that's wrong,  but does nothing about it. Apprentally she's tired and wants to go home.   This is no way to ruin a business.  One star.   That's not wrong."}
{"text":"Glad the service is great.   If you sit at the bar your vision is blocked by the beer traps and liquor bar setup.   This is a poor design.   They make a terrible bloody marry but thre service is good.   They will even change TV channels without hesitation."}
{"text":"The server (Dylan) was friendly right from the beginning. It was a slow night so we were catered pretty well. I remember being here during a fight night and hated it. The food came out right away and now I am stuffed. But we need to make room for the desert nachos. This is a great place when it's not game day. I will come more often especially during happy hour, however Heineken is not included."}
{"text":"Wow!  Good food, great service.  On a long road trip, stumbled across this place while checking out ASU, and was so happy with the fantastic service. One waitress came around and offered us samples of any sauces we wanted to try. Smart--I never would have ordered the sauces just based on description alone.   Hint:  sample the sauces before ordering. The strawberry Hot sauce was fantastic, as was the Asian, for those who love the sweet & spicy.  Also loved the Mac & Cheese.  Free refills on soda."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! SOGGY WINGS! Ordered online for pick up. My husband and I were planning on using our points since we're running low on cash until payday. When he arrived he was told they haven't accepted points for a few months now unless it's done through a new website. We were never told and there was NOTHING on their website that said so. When he was asking if he could just re-order from the new website they said they wouldn't be able to help him. The morning male manager was so rude it was unbelievable. I am in shock that a place would deliver such TERRIBLE customer service. On top of that, my wings were soggy and there was barely any flavor on them. Don't give them the time of day. That manager should be fired. If you're going to act like such a jacka**, don't work in customer service. MORON!"}
{"text":"This 5-star rating is for the gentleman, Miracle Eli, who took our order and was very attentive! Kudos to you, sir! We really appreciate your service."}
{"text":"Picked up my food to go and it was cold, that was a deciding factor of why I'll never go to bww again."}
{"text":"Came in here and the food took forever and after we was finished eating they took 25 minutes to come back to my table for me to pay the check.... Seriously"}
{"text":"I ordered online which was easy. The site is very easy to use.    I ordered Normal Hot Wings  half wing half nuggets.  With something called cheddar nuggets.  The wings where not hot, they where super nuke hot.. I mean too hot to eat. Now I am a person that orders wings everywhere in every state I go. Hot wings are not the hottest... there are levels above hot.   The chicken itself looked and tasted like they reheated left overs from the lunch rush... I ordered after 2:00.  No way these where made for me.  I guess they dump there old food on TAKE OUT.. so beware of that too.  Don't even get me started on the cheddar things... did not taste like cheddar and where mostly dough.  Not like the picture where cheese pours out of one cut in half.  I now remember why I haven't eaten here in years.  I tossed the entire meal out.... $20 for crap."}
{"text":"Gave BWW another chance. Fun crowd got a seat at the bar where Tiffany took care of us. My order snack medium with hot sauce on the side got screwed up. HOWEVER  Tiffany was attentive and corrected it in no time.  My friends orders came out as ordered. Not looking for gourmet dining just good bar food and atmosphere that is why I keep trying.  Some day."}
{"text":"Went there today around 3:00 for a beer and to use the men's room . NO TOILET PAPER, that was just a lousy experience. Not going back!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS great food and excellent service. Request to be in Katie's dining section. Let her know you saw it in YELP!"}
{"text":"WOw  so many t.v.s on basket ball all at once  .. the waitress was very helpful when  asking what she suggest as a sauce for a buffalito  she turned back on me finding my taste preferences..  I had a lite lunch special of  a buffalito and side salad  and i ordered  some onion rings idky i did.. the buffalito was more a small soft taco size and heavy on the shredded lettuce   the salsa wasn't fresh but had a nice flavor it left me wanting more  the salad was good and crisp ..my o-rings we fresh and crisp  not oily .. my over all meal left me wanting more .. the waitress kept our drinks full and wanting to chit chat but not annoyingly so.. my only real disappointment was ..wanting more ..."}
{"text":"I ordered over the phone and I went in at the time I was supposed to. The young lady that was helping us out was not friendly at all. We had asked her to split the check & she had a lot of attitude. I love going to buffalo and I love the food here but good customer service is really important to have. I will not go back again. On top of this rude person the order was wrong and we had to wait another 15-20min so the other part of our order was cold. I just think that they need to be a little more organized it looked really hectic."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The food was great. The restaurant itself was wide open and spacious.  I didn't feel crowded or over whelmed by the volume either.    Our waitress was gracious, helpful and everything about our venture was positive."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had two good experiences.   We simply ordered the wings both times.  The service was prompt, courteous and it was a fun environment.    It is a little off the beaten path if you're just driving through.  They have plenty of tv's for your viewing and plenty of sports to check out too"}
{"text":"Wings were delicious hot and spicy. Service was so so. Wife wanted a glass for her beer and it never came. Lots of servers and packed on a saturday night."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a BW3s in a while and I was glad to return.  I came here with a fishing buddy after moving my younger brother into his apartment for college.  They have an excellent \"60 cent boneless buffalo wings\" special on Thursdays and we hit that up.  We phoned our order in and picked up in 10 minutes.  The service was quick and prompt, even though the place was bustling (the Thursday wing special is very popular).  I highly recommend the Parmesan garlic sauce and the mango habanero sauces for the wings.  Both are delicious.  While I prefer actual wings the boneless wings, the meat was good and tender.  Plus there's a liquor store next door so you can pick some beers up with your carry-out.  Everyone wins!"}
{"text":"Sometimes the waiters and waitresses are great, sometimes they are absolutely infuriating.  Sometimes the food is good, sometimes you'd have been better off going somewhere else for wings and fries.  See, with this particular wild wings you never know what you'll get.  It's nothing like a box of chocolates though, because at least with that its consistent in some form."}
{"text":"I come here every once in a while for lunch, and every time the service is terrible.  Food is good, but I have been waiting for my check for about 10 minutes, no server in sight"}
{"text":"Happy hour stops at 12 and the service is unbelievably slow and the employees can dance and sing along to the music. Plus my friend just turned 21 at midnight and they don't honor power hour? Don't ever go there"}
{"text":"Just wanna ask question. If u go to restaurant and made order, what should servers should bring? Isn't it silverware and plate? Omg. MIKE. I believe he is the manager, and so rude to us. Omg I just wanna upload the pic."}
{"text":"The food & service was great and all but I feel disrespected. I paid with my hard earned money to have songs played on the jukebox. I wanted to listen to my favorite song (All Star by Smashmouth) four times in a row while I enjoyed my appetizers after a long day at work. So im going about eating my fried pickles, which were great btw, and my song was played twice so I was enjoying life. As I continued on and the song was about to come on for the 3rd time it WAS SKIPPED. I didnt think anything of it at 1st but then THE 4TH TIME WAS SKIPPED AS WELL. I paid with my hard earned cash to just enjoy my favorite song and it was skipped even when I paid for it. I expected more from such a fun place. Im just disappointed this time around."}
{"text":"Because there was no option for zero stars. By far the worst dining experience I have ever had, hands down. I was embarrassed that I suggested that my colleague and I meet at this location for lunch. The food was okay but the service is what really killed the entire experience for us both. While waiting for my colleague, I was asked several times if I was okay and if I needed an appetizer. I feel that I made it pretty clear that I was going to wait for the other member of the party. The waitress continued to visit and ask if I was okay, which was fine, it was not annoying yet.   When we did finally order she told the other member of the party that they could not prepare his meal that way, that she would check but knew they would say no. Wow! Really? Any server would tell the guest that they would check and leave it at that. Now comes the kicker, we were asked if we wanted dessert while still in the middle of our meal. No joke. I can't make this stuff up. I don't know why I keep going back to this place to give it another chance. On top of that, after discussing with the manager, she said that they hope to make it better when I return. I will never be back to this location unless there is another tenant in that space."}
{"text":"Happy hour after midnight and a good combo on tuesdays for 50 cent wings love that this location is 24hrs"}
{"text":"Tried getting a table at 8pm after a coyotes game. Was told an hour & a half wait. While I'm looking at SEVEN empty table on the patio. Went to the use the restroom on the way out and all trash cans were overflowing, the toilet was clogged. Mostly I'm Shocked at the wait with the abundance of empty tables outside. Won't bother trying to eat here again after a game. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great bar with moderate drink selection. Wings are tasty as always. Only complaint is the noise level within facility."}
{"text":"I visited this location for lunch during the week and while the food and service were very good, the order entirely too long to be prepared. I had a party of two and we waited nearly 30  minutes for our meals."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 0 stars I was here waited for ever for my table and then they started to sit people who came in after me first when I asked why ohh there a large party so we seat them first then I get my table and it's dirty food on seats top is sticky the gm then said sorry for the confusion but never offered me any comps or anything did not offer to even clean the table very disappointed"}
{"text":"We love Buffalo Wild Wings usually; however this particular location, while the food was still what has come to be expected seriously lacked in service. Our waiter basically forgot about us the entire night, order was effed up, didn't get our beverage refills (large beers) for well over 15 minutes after ordering, the employees just seemed to have an overwhelming lack of enthusiasm for this place. It sucked guys :/. Hate to say it. Have the two stars purely based on the food still being what expected; good wings."}
{"text":"The wings are always good. This location is the busiest since it's on Las Vegas blvd. If they are too busy they will let you sit by the bar but make sure you have your id's. Overall it's nice here."}
{"text":"Fun place to watch games. It is usually fairly clean, seems like the staff stays on top of keeping it tidy. The staff are always very attentive and friendly. Usually pretty busy even on late nights. Love the twisted margarita."}
{"text":"i expect high prices so i'm not complaining - just pointing out. their sauce flavors are 9.5/10 - amazing.   what disappoints me is this:  normal sauced wings - basically bone-dry, sauce definitely not on every bite \"wet\" sauced wings - even though i say \"wet\", there is still not sauce on every bite  these guys are supposed to be wing experts.... and for right around $1/wing - give me a break!!    bottom line alert*************************************************  food is great, price are high, if you like sauce on your wings you better request 2x wet - and also tell the waiter that you will be returning the wings if they dont have enough sauce!!!"}
{"text":"So we just live down the road and this is my hubby and my treat on a tuesday or thursday night.  Usually everything is fine, the food is good. Can't say anything about that. We go there usually once a week and tonight and the last time we just had bad service. The waiter is not comming to the table to take order, not asking us, if we need anything. After the manager took our order and the runner brought it out, our empty plates were sitting there.  I must say, I don't care how good the food is, but bad service make the hole expierence bad. Oh and stay away from the waiter Rochelle, that's the one from tonight, you'll have no luck to order from her or anything else from her. We're going to stay away from there, drive a longer distance and just try another one with better service!"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience of my life at this location. Showed up and got \"in line\" to watch a UFC event @ 3:30. We were told people in line will start being let in at 4:30. As the time approached 5:00 there were at least 50 people in line and no one going in.  Several people kept going in to ask when we would be going in, and each one got a different answer. The event started @ 5:00 and at 5:15 many of us were still outside and very irritated. There were a few people who got tired of the wait and left. One person went in just before 5:30 to get an update and witnessed the Manager giving a \"pep talk\" which was more like a chewing out of employees. The mgr did in no way seem to be professional and seemed to not care that there was line of people outside all waiting to see an event that had already started. When people finally started going in at approximately 5:30 the Mgr at one point stopped and said \"in the last 10 minutes I have let in approximately 25 people, we have to stop or we're going to kill our kitchen\" She at no point explained to the people waiting what the hold up was, or even apologize for the delay. The food was ok, nothing to brag about. The chips & salsa were bland, definitely wouldn't order that again. We were seated at a corner table, and as the building became full and obviously no one else could fit, they let all the remaining people stand in the lobby. From our view a few of the standing people were blocking views of the tv's.  We even at some point asked them to move over so we could see, and after multiple requests we had to call our server to help us with this. Bottom line of this was they were more concerned with serving those standing people beverages then the customers sitting at tables. One of the worst showings of customer service and me and the group I was with will never go there again."}
{"text":"Do you always refill ones soft drink or water using a To-Go cup or am I just special? Does one always let the wings, fries, and fried pickles set in the window to the point the can be mistaken for ice cubes?"}
{"text":"If you need to indulge in a mountain of deep fried deliciousness this is for you! I'll recommend: mozzarella sticks, cheese curds, chicken tenders and sandwiches. The wings are so/so. The fries are usually good but fries are always a hit and a miss. Parmesan Garlic sauce is to die for! Trivia keeps everyone entertained. Great service.   Overall: good food, not healthy at all, great service and not terribly vegetarian friendly unless you are willing to eat an appetizer or salad for dinner."}
{"text":"Their corn dog minis are terrific. The boneless sweet BBQ wings are good. Not the best I've had. The waiter we had was new and put our wings in all wrong but the manager gave us 25% off our bill for the inconvenience. That was nice of her to do. I remember the wings being better than what we had today. Oh and they are starting to charge extra for sauces - ranch and the like so be aware of that."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Always friendly. Great food.  For being a sports bar it is super kid friendly.  They offer games at the table and a good selection of kids menu options."}
{"text":"My second favorite place for wings.  It a chain but I love there wings!  Mango habenero have great flavor between sweet and fiery but they are very sticky.  My other sauced wing favorite is there spicy garlic, it's very very good.  As for there dry seasoned wings I recommend desert heat.  Has a smoky sweet flavor with just a little spice.  A + for this place"}
{"text":"What late night with family isn't completed by making a run to the only restaurant open after 10 on a weeknight to grab a late night meal? There weren't many people here this night so it was great.   I usually get an order of wings but this time I got the buffalo ranch chicken wrap with fries. It was actually really good. I will definitely add this to my rotation the next time I'm there!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer:This will be long because so many things were unacceptable, and i feel they are worth mentioning. Hopefully someone in charge reads this. This place needs Bar Rescue or an intervention from corporate.   Where do I begin with this disaster? I arrived in the late afternoon/early evening on Valentine's Day. I walked in and stopped at the hostess stand. The girl who is standing there saw me and then walked away to speak with to the left of the entrance (I'm assuming it was the to go area). The person she spoke to pointed her back to me and told her to seat me prior to whatever they were discussing.  I requested a table off to the side so that I wouldn't have my back to the dining room while using my tablet. This proved to be a difficult request for the hostess.  She flagged down a 2nd hostess who said she could help. She walked me past many open tables/areas to a high table next to the end of the bar. At the time, it seemed fine.   A server walked by my table and asked me if the hostesses seated me. Her tone was not friendly. I said yes and she walked off with another server that had come by, mumbling about to them about having her table sat. I didn't even get a standard \"______ is your server,\" or \"your server will be right with you,\" from her rude interaction.  My server Bruce arrived and he was the only positive from this experience. He was great. Personable,  he told me about the specials, & answered my menu questions. He gave 5 star service(or as close as you can get in a wing joint). They desperately need more employees like him.  About 2 minutes after I initially say down I noticed a group of staff(3-8 people, the number varied [including the female mgr]) beginning to congregate at the end of the bar behind where I was sitting. Their conversations ranged from why they were quitting their jobs,  how much they no longer liked the place, to why no one should be in there on Valentines Day, and how pathetic it was to be there. They suggested the customers should go to Olive Garden across the street. While hanging out, one of the servers was eating the fruit used to garnish drinks. That's definitely not health inspector approved. The bartender told her to stop because she's 'tired of getting cussed out over the missing fruit.' A few minutes later one of them knocked a stack of serving trays on the ground where they were leaning.That was it for me. I could no longer tolerate being there. It felt more like a middle schoolunch room than a restaurant.  I've never seen a restaurant that has the staff hanging out in large groups during business hours near customers. The other bad reviews were right, there is a serious lack of professionalism and respect from the staff.   My order came out and I had it boxed up for takeout. The wings were on the bottom end of average. I got 2 different sauces. The honey mustard wings barely had any sauce. About half of each wing had sauce and the flavor was weak. The parmesean garlic wings had enough sauce but I didn't care for them."}
{"text":"Sunday Funday Football!!! Our waitress, Angie was awesome! the onion rings are great! Light batter, hot, fresh etc...everything you'd want in an onion ring BUT the portion was small... like 7 rings I think... lame. Shared the stampede burger, It was pretty good! Not anything I'd come running back for but above average. The fries that accompanied said burger were cold and blah BUT thank goodness I had them after trying the ridic hot mango habanero wings... good god! You know I LOVE spicy, sweaty, kill me now hot but these were crazy! Really good! Just a bit too much for me! Ask for extra ranch!"}
{"text":"Football & beer! Yay! Great place to watch the game! Good service, tons of TVs = awesomeness!!!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is the typical go to place to meet my friends.  I have been to several locations around the valley and the service at this one is by far the worst.  The waitress started out ok, but when half of our group asked her to come back for their order in 10 minutes, she just didn't.  We would flag her down to order something, she would take that order and run off without even checking if any of the rest of us needed anything.  (Before any of us could ask for anything either!). Two of the members in our party wanted to play the trivia game.  Unfortunately, there was a problem with the system where they could connect.  (Not a huge deal, not upset about it not working). We were able to get the manager to check, and he promptly reset it, but never came back to check if it was fixed!  (It wasn't.) The food we got was still yummy, but would give 0 stars for the service."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this style of food. I was first indroduced to Buffalo Wild Wings in Iowa, while in college. Since then, their menu continuously inproves, and the offerings are fantastic. This location is the most conveniently located for my typical commute. Despite the convenience, I would rate this as the best restaurant in the chain. The staff is friendly, the food is dependably excellent, and the layout is both welcoming and comfortable. Please, \"b-dubs,\" take a look at what is going on at this restaurant and use it as an example of how other locations should be. Great job, and kudos to the staff for making this an excellent dining experience.  Pros: you get what you expect, but with lots of extras. It's buffalo wings, and a variety of sauces and sides. Other dishes include sandwiches and the like, if you're not in the mood for the flagship offerings. Equipment such as seating and counters, entertainment options, etc., are all in good clean shape.  Cons: There could be easier parking lot access."}
{"text":"The manager Mark was very nice and accommodating. You can tell he cares about his employees. Our server Bryan was awesome and willing to take on our family even though it was close to closing for the dinning area. Food was great and service was awesome. Great job Mark and Bryan. Also a shout out to Mel who greeted us quickly and was very polite. Thanks BWW. Keep up the great service."}
{"text":"Came here while in town for Spring Training. I must say it's the best BWW experience ever. I dine at BWW at least once or twice a month. This was the fastest and best service I have ever had. Johnny was our waiter and was supported by another server. However, Johnny did a phenomenal job. He set a very high standard for the rest of his peers and others in the business. My family and I were taken back by how professional and fast Johnny and the crew at BWW were on this night. They even put on a L.A. Kings game during March Madness. Once again just wanted to express my appreciation for Johnny, the BWW team, and management who have Johnny on their team. They are doing something right with having Johnny and others working for them with a similar work ethic.   Thanks"}
{"text":"If I could give this business less than 1 I would. Let me tell you what a horrible experience I had ordering takeout. I don't live in the area, I ordered for pickup and paid for it and left. After leaving BW, I checked my order and half of my order was missing. Shortly after I called and spoke to the manager, he assured me to come back \"anytime\" that I would have \"credit to redeem\". So not thinking anything of it I gave him my name.   Fast forward almost a year, I live in the area swung by to place another order also redeem my PAID credit. But a new manager came out not even willing to locate my PAID credit telling me it's expired and that management changed. He also told me nothing he can do and didn't bother to even make a customer happy. Let me tell you how terrible this Customer Service experience was. Why in the world do I have to pay again for something I had already paid for and promised to redeem? It's such horrible business ethics, I would never ever recommend this place to anyone. BAD customer service, BAD management just poor attitude. All over 12 bucks. I'm a business owner as well with a business in the area and it's no wonder they're losing a lot of their customers. If you don't know how to service your customers properly than don't be in the industry!"}
{"text":"If you think you'll be getting your food without a good 30-40 minutes wait, think again! Every time I've gone to this place I had to wait for a ridiculously long time before I get the food and the restaurant is not even busy (maybe another 1-2 tables with customers). Overall, customer service is very poor. We asked for napkins 3x and never got them!"}
{"text":"I come here quite a bit and it's generally the same thing. Quick to seat, loud music. To the point where waitresses and waiters can't hear what we order.   I'll give a play by play on this trip.  9:58 we are seated.  10:00 we order drinks at happy hour.  10:13 we get drinks.  10:15 she finally realizes we never got menus.  10:21 order. Have to repeat one part 4 times between the two of us for her to hear it.  10:41 got food. Very rushed and in a hurry. 11:01 we finished eating.  11:02. Got the bill.   Food is good as always, and at least they give you wet naps so you can clean your own table when you sit down. Good food. Poor service as usual"}
{"text":"I watched the Superbowl at BWW this year - we walked in about 10 minutes before the start of the game and were surprised to be seated right away! It was definitely packed, but it was clear that they had prepared for the crowds. Our server Allison was amazing and checked on us frequently (although there was a group of servers hanging out by the kitchen and talking/watching the game for most of the time we were there).   The food was average - the boneless wings have a lot of meat in them and the prices aren't outrageous! I tried the Chocolate Cake Milkshake and was disappointed, though - the consistency was off and I felt like I was drinking an Icee (not a great sensation with the chocolate flavor)."}
{"text":"Myself, a spouse of someone who is active duty in the U.S. Air Force, along with someone who is a dependent of a 25 year USAF Veteran and whose father is now deceased, but also served in the USAF was refused a discount today when at this location by his waitress as well as the manager, Stephen; who was very rude when we asked for a manager, when he provided his military I.D. because he is not active duty, retired or a spouse of such. Another reason given by this poor excuse of a manager was because they have had problems in the past with people misusing their discount. So now it is the managers right to say who is deserving or earned their military discounts after time served fighting for our country? Okay. After the other person was denied their discount I was highly upset so I did not even bother asking for mine. He and I will never return to this location and I will make sure everyone I know who is retired and/or active duty is aware of this \"new policy\" that has been in effect for 3 months, yet it is not posted anywhere. You cannot pick and choose who gets their military discount. They did not pick and choose who they fight for when they are at war. Military active duty, retired, spouse and/or dependents are entitled like everywhere else that provides military discount!"}
{"text":"I have never given a one star review yet but this specific location was pretty bad. (I have been to countless other BWW locations across the country for reference). First it feels a lot smaller than other locations and it smells terrible in there. Like moldy laundry almost. And the menus were disgusting( greasy and still had sauce on it).  The service was slow too, granted it was the super bowl but our server didn't even come until half way through the second quarter. Similar service for people around. The food was luke warm and didn't give us silverware, refill our drinks, or bring us carrot/celery. They guy didn't even seem like he cared. There was like food or something smeared on one of the tvs in our line of sight. I'm not expecting 5 star service,but this was pretty bad. Just avoid this location or go to another sports bar in the area."}
{"text":"So what they turned corporate?  So what they weigh their wings instead of traditional 6-12-24 wing combos?  It's B Dubs....and the food is always good. One of the really great things about this chain is the daily wing/food specials are available to go. Most places won't let you have wing night to go...not here. Boneless wing Thursday's to go thank you. I call it BW3's and I prob always will. The location is great and the TV's are even better. Staff always friendly and they don't play music during Cleveland sporting events."}
{"text":"I always have low expectations when i go to Buffalo Wild Wings because of the service, but this location rocks my darn socks off! My waitress was super attentive and cared about my food feelings as well. Quickest service at the busiest lunch hour and the whole staff is super friendly. I highly recommend this Buffalo Wild Wings location."}
{"text":"Typical buffalo wild wings. Good happy hour deals $3 drinks and appetizers. Good wings. They have deals on traditional wings on Tuesdays and on boneless on Thursdays. I love the desert heat wing seasoning it's the best."}
{"text":"I really don't like Buffalo Wild Wings.  My boyfriend loves getting the take out from there when it is late so I end up eating alot of food from here.  The wings are not great... there was a feather on one of the wings from the last batch I got.  I actually really like the sauces, but the quality of the chicken is terrible.  There are very few healthy food options available.  One time I got what I thought was supposed to be a Greek salad, but it had blue cheese on it.  Everyone knows greek salad has feta cheese!  The service can be either really great or really bad.  It just depends on who you get.  I remember one time it took us like 20 minutes to get our drink order.    Over all, Buffalo Wild Wings is a chain restraunt and there is nothing excectional about it.  I only order here if it is after 10 pm and no where else in Gastonia is open.    PS... if you watch games there are lots of tvs!"}
{"text":"Like always the service is mediocre.  It is so loud in there that you can not get good service.  There are tvs, trivia and music.  It is sensory overload.    The server did not bother to give us a full list of specials.  I wanted to order a beer and I was told it was happy hour.  However, nothing was explained to me.  What does this mean?  It was just \"eh.\"  I asked for a spicy recommendation.  I ordered Asian Zing.  Not spicy.  Nope, nope, nope.    I have no idea why I ever go back to this place.  It is nice for specific events and outings."}
{"text":"The food sucks about as much as the wait staff... Do not go there unless you only plan on drinking."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience. The service was extremely slow and my wing's did not have any of the salt & vinegar rub. When I spoke to the mgr she said the kitchen was \"careless\" and forgot. She offered me a box so I could shake the rub on myself. I declined. She finally asked if I wanted new wings. I was on lunch so I could not wait. She gave me a credit for the NEXT visit. I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"it was ok ish.. to loud ... not only did our server seen just to not care we were there :( the food was ok too but really not my type of place."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant. Pleasantly surprised. This is the perfect sports bar, TVs everywhere. Our order was promptly taken at lunch time. I was impressed that a team of two came to the table to check and make sure everything was going well. This team checked back twice. I liked that. There are lunch specials and I ordered the honey Barbecue wings that came with fries and celery and carrot sticks. $7.99. I cannot understand all the comments about how pricey this place is. Good value for what you get. The wings come in a large variety of flavors and degree of heat. The other three girls I was with liked their wings too. Excellent service. I will be back."}
{"text":"Normal B Dub food. Staff was great. Both draft and can beer was warm. Had 2 and had to move on to the next bar."}
{"text":"Service is good, sometimes the order takes a while to arrive. Also, some of the flavors in traditional wings are not consistent - especially lemon & pepper and mango habanero. Other than that, everything's great!"}
{"text":"Look at all these bad reviews.  It's time for people to let Buffalo Wild Wings at this location know we don't put up with such poor service here in Mesa, AZ.  Let's also let them know that we will no longer pay such high prices for their low quality food.  Posting here on Yelp can be powerful, and actually drive a bad business out of town.  But in the mean time, I think we need to do more than that.  I encourage residents to choose another place to watch a game or to eat.  And to ask others to do the same until the owner makes a positive change.   Cheap... as in poor quality for the money.    I wouldn't go here if you're hungry and want to eat a meal.  This place is more for watching a game on one of the many TV's, and maybe ordering an appetizer and beer.  It's not exactly a quiet place.  I ordered wings with a small order of cheese fries.  I've eaten better tasting and better quality wings bought frozen, and then baked at home. The vinegar and salt seasoning was tasteless.  The mild wing sauce was too spicy (for me) and didn't taste like much other than whatever they thickened it with.  We couldn't help but look at each other and snicker when the waitress set the fries on the table.  They were in a tiny paper dish about 4\"x3\".  It had a bit of cheese melted to oblivion.  I sent it back.  The celery was cut from the outside of the stalk - tough and stringy.  Glad I had dental floss picks in my purse.  He ordered a chicken sandwich, and paid .60 extra for the wedge cut fries.  He said it was just ok, and that a McDonald's chicken sandwich was better.  We eat out quite a lot and don't remember ever having eaten at a place that charges extra for a different kind of french fries.  The whole pitiful carnival-type \"meal\" came to a whopping $35 with the tip.  And we didn't even order drinks.  We drank water.  For that price, we could have gone next door to BJ's, and had excellent meals on real plates, and experienced servers.  As the patrons were clearing out, because the game on TV was over, their tables were left a mess for longer than we would have liked.  The waitresses have to buss the tables. Not only that, but they have to wash the dishes from the tables they served!  Course, this would only be cups, dinnerware, and plastic baskets.   But, I have never heard of such a thing.   Because the owner of this place is too cheap to hire bussers?  The only thing we were impressed with is their effort to make a gluten free menu."}
{"text":"Delicious food, surprisingly. Especially the gyros and fries. Great sports bar and restaurant. Nice if you need a break and want to eat some good food!"}
{"text":"So I'm visiting Champaign from out of town and asked where the best place to go would be to watch the USC vs ND game. I was pointed to B-dubs as the best choice due to the excess of tv's available and a more moderate noise level than most Champaign sports bars.   The experience was a nose dive from the start.   We got our table quickly and the waitress was nice enough. After ordering my drink I requested that my game be put on on the tv directly in front of me. At that moment the tv was showing figure skating, of all things, and of the 50+ screens in the place none of the others had my game on. Simple enough request.   10 minutes later, still looking at men in tights twirling on ice, fail.   Asked another waitress to put the game on. She smiled and said she would handle it.   10 minutes later, still getting my eyes burned out of my head. Fail!  At this point I give up, I'm not an ass by nature and won't get aggressive. I settle to watching updates on my iPhone.   20 minutes after that, one of my friends (who is also not from the area) points BEHIND me and asks if the tv behind me had my game on. I turn around and sure enough..they had put my game on..on the wrong freakin tv! FAIL!  To top the experience off, two of the meals ordered to our table were wrong. And half of the meals were brought a full 20 minutes before the other half..one of which was a salad of all things easy to make.   I was going to give 2 stars despite all of this cuz I'm a b-dubs fan, but unfortunately I had decided to try out their \"Desert Heat\" wings tonight. No flavor, no heat, their mild sauce has more kick..yet this flavor is over the halfway point to their hot sauce.   -1 star for not appropriately labeling this sauce..I wanted my face to melt a bit while trying a new flavor. FAILURE!!!"}
{"text":"Expectations are already low and somehow it was worse. Slow service, very dirty restaurant and food was cold.  Let's of better options"}
{"text":"Customer service at this place is so bad. We waited for a good half an hour, and when we checked with the hostess she said our name had already been called. We told her wed been sitting in front of the podium the whole time, and she gave us an attitude. If that wasn't bad enough, after seating we waited a good 10 min without being offered a drink or appetizers, and someone started taking an order from a table that was seated well after we were. I had to holler at a bus boy to get our order taken. There were five employees running around this section, and none of them had the time to even greet us? This visit was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying the food and the happy hour at this location was a 4 STAR. With that being said. With the exception of RUSH THE BARTENDER for the first half of my visit. The staff was straight up GHETTO and unprofessional. Vanessa the bartender who replaced Rush showed up late and with her kid. Talking to another waiter, that obviously she was sleeping with in the most  Inappropriate language. The waiters and waitresses that approached the bar to get there drinks were talking about there personal lives and not shy about it. Long story short. Ghetto ass staff. But if you visit the bar at this location. Call ahead and ask if Rush the bartender is working. She was amazing and gave great service."}
{"text":"I've found it. I've found the worst ribs in the city. And you'll be able to experience them also if you head down to Buffalo Wild Wings. I made the mistake of ordering the 1/2 slab of ribs and wings and what came out was the saddest boiled ribs I've ever seen or tasted. I should have known better than to order ribs at a non-BBQ place so I have no one to blame but myself. The ribs were small, rubbery, tasteless, and full of fat. There was no chance of the meat falling off the bone. It was the epitome of failure. The wings, on the other hand, are always tasty. Service was decent but nothing note worthy. I'm still a fan of this chain, but not their ribs."}
{"text":"Having been to many other B-Dubs in town this one doesn't fair as well as far as the service goes. The food is always great I do have to say that. This is one I feel most comfortable at. I'm a sucker for the Sampler Platter (almost) every time. You get nachos (salsa isn't that great I ask for con queso on top instead) you get Mozzarella Sticks and Boneless Wings (Honey BBQ is my choice) and Onion Rings. It's just the right amount of all the yumminess I'm looking for :)  The service is usually slow though so getting refills on your drink isn't likely or often enough. I waited for over a half hour for the order to come out. I suppose it is the tasty food that keeps me going back! OK it is the tasty food that keeps me going back hehe. This last visit I had to get up and ask the hostess to get someone to get me a refill. The food tasting good is important to me, but the service is too.   They have a variety of options to choose from besides wings. They offer burgers, chicken sandwiches, wraps, and salads.  Check them out on Facebook or the B-Dubs website because they have weekly specials on wings. They have TV's everywhere. If you like watching sports, drinking beer, and eating chicken wings then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I came in here with my boyfriend Sunday night around 1am for a late dinner. There was no sign to seat yourself but no one greeted us. No big deal though, we just waltzed in and had a seat in the corner. The food and drink were just as good as it is during regular business hours and the server/bartender was nice even though we weren't at the bar. I actually liked that only the back bar area was lit up. It felt very private and clubby, but the music wasn't terribly loud. We only had to shout over a couple songs, the rest were okay. Not my ideal date (this wasn't really a date anyway just dinner) but it was still good. And the pretzels are to die for, just really wish they had a nacho or cheddar type cheese sauce instead of the tex-mex queso they give you. I was also confused because the menu said they come with a queso and your choice of mustard or any other BWW sauce, but they didn't ask about that, just defaulted to two queso dips instead. Still would totally come back!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars because the service was amazing and the price is very good for wings. I got my food much faster than I expected and they were quite busy at the time too. However, the wings were terribly freezer burnt (or at least that's what it tasted like). I'll still give them five stars for great service and perhaps I just got a bad batch, but the wings were atrocious. Otherwise a great experience."}
{"text":"This is my regular BWW. They do anything needed to make the experience right. Looking forward to it reopening after the remodel!"}
{"text":"Went there just to grab a beer and a burger with a friend. There were no big football or basketball games on so it wasn't super busy. First problem is that I had to wait at least 10 minutes for a bartender to acknowledge I was there. Finally got a beer and it was good. I decided to order a build it your self burger. It was a pretty simple order. I wanted honey bbq sauce, cheddar chesse, bacon, and pickles. Seems simple right? Well it came out with the bbq sauce, cheese, close to a pound of finely shredded lettuce, no bacon, no pickles. I DO NOT LIKE sending my food back or complaining but I couldn't eat it that way. I sent it back and told them what I had ordered again. Between 5-10 minutes the bartender asked if I just wanted the lettuce scrapped off or a new burger. My response was that I could have scrapped off the lettuce and it's going to be cold. So I got the same burger and ice cold pickles on it and still no bacon. I wasn't thrilled about my food. The manager was so busy watching basketball he wasn't helping anyone behind the bar and especially not the customers. Pretty much an overall FAIL on their part. Poor management in this restaurant so you're better off just finding somewhere else to eat. I won't be back and I live right beside it."}
{"text":"Just went here the other day with a friend since we were craving some crispy chicken wings and fries and boy did it hit the spot! I don't know why I always get cravings on days that aren't on Tuesday (traditional) or Thursday (boneless) to take advantage of their promotions :(.  I recommend getting the honey bbq and Parmesan garlic wings since they are pretty good. The honey bbq has a hint of sweetness while the Parmesan garlic is creamy and flavorful. Their sauce distribution could be a bit more consistent since there were times where I barely had any sauce on my wings which made it taste plain and dry. I guess they are just skimping out on the sauces. My favorite flavor is lemon pepper, but it doesn't taste as good here compared to Wingstop. I would just stick to their sauces and avoid the dry flavors.   This place is really convenient since it is open 24/7, so you can go here whenever you feel hungry! It's near the mall so you can eat and shop right after or vice versa. The only downer is that service can be slow at times even though there aren't many people in the restaurant. The staff is really nice and they even let you try out some sauces before ordering.   Worth checking out, especially for late night munchies/cravings! Just be warned that it can get a bit loud if there is a game going on, but that's part of the fun right?"}
{"text":"Great location and we always get fast service. Staff is also super friendly and love how they always take the time to talk and acknowledge my 3 year old. One thing that I have noticed is that their menu has gotten smaller over the years. I miss the build your own sandwiches option they used to have. Otherwise great overall!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the service and the general manager.  I usually come here for Monday night football as well as pay per view fights. Tonight I came in for the boxing match,  I came in early so I can get a good table to watch the fight,  while the preliminary fights were going on,  the manager came up to me and told me that she was going to find me new friends and that they were going to sit at my table to which I replied,  I am waiting for my friends and she said well,  I will be back in a few minutes and if they are not here I am going to ask you to pay for your friends in advance or you are going to make new friends. Once again, I was there early so we could have a table. That manager is not a good business woman, she needs to learn how to treat customers as customers versus inmates. second, the service was incredibly slow and only saw our waiter seldomly, it would have been easier to walk to the bar to get my drinks. I don't know if I should give them a second chance or go somewhere where else where they want my money."}
{"text":"This place closed last week and cannot find out why. anyone know?? seemed like they were always doing well...  UPDATE: The owner was not paying his royalties for the 5 stores he had and they shut him down. I understand they will reopen but under BWW ownership..."}
{"text":"Bad experience every, single, time. I give 2 stars because the food is good, but the service is sub par. West Gate is a good location, but the building itself is just too small to host as many people as it does."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE I have ever experienced!!!!! After a hour and a half wait from the un organized teenage staff \"I watched so many people seated that arrived after us I began to think did they forget us?.... and they did! This is what they told us! Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"I am giving this BDubs a 1 because my friends and I received some of the worst service of our lives. We went to watch Sunday NFL and were ready to drop a pretty penny on food and drinks but our waitress chose to ignore us. I told her several times how we felt neglected and wanted to keep ordering beers and entrees. It almost seemed like she was ignoring our table on purpose, and it wasn't really all that busy. I complained to the hostesses a few times to no avail. When I wanted to pay my bill and leave, I asked the hostesses for the check because I knew my waitress would take forever. I asked them to close me out and they handed the check to a manager who then walked around the restaurant and handed the bill back to my waitress which I made clear I wished to avoid. The joke is on her because she could have served us a lot more food and drinks and gotten quite a nice tip. Suffice it to say I will find another sports bar or stick to the sports books. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this location late night after work for some beer and grub.  Was pleasantly surprised to find out they were open 24x7 and that it was happy-hour when I arrived just after midnight! I had the starter tacos, followed by some wild wings and a few beers.  Everything was really good, including the service.  Two thumbs up and really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"No one ever came to take our order.  We Packed up and left.  BWW has great food but the service is going downhill.   Visit was 4/11/17 at 4:30pm."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!  The only good part of this experience was the drive home, agreeing not to come back here anymore!  We went in on a Saturday night, slightly expecting to have to wait to be seated.  But that wasn't the case!  In fact, it was so dead inside that they were closing all of the booths and cleaning up, only seating people right next to the bar.  Surprisingly though, the food took forever to come out.  It took 20 minutes for our nachos to come out, and you could tell they had run out of tomatoes and jalapenos, because they were fresh, like from the grocery store, while the rest of the toppings had obviously spent a week or two in the fridge.  Then, it took another 15 minutes for our wings to come out.  Not only were they over cooked, but the seasoning on them was scarce!  My lemon pepper wings didn't have enough seasoning to cover even 1/3 of the amount of wings that were in the tray, let alone all of them!  And the Blue Moon BBQ sauce tastes like garbage, don't waste your time!  And the worst part of the night was the carrots and celery they gave me!!  It was brown and mushy, on the verge of being a moldy wonderland, but when brought to their attention, what do you think happened?!?  NOTHING!!  The waitress said she would tell the kitchen staff (like they cared in the first place), but instead went and flirted with another employee that was cleaning. She ignored us for the remainder of the visit.  We were not pleased, so she received the tip she deserved...  $0!!  I hate not tipping, but you need to at least show me that you give a hoot!!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!"}
{"text":"What can I say it's buffalo wild wings. Had mozerrella stick for apps and chicken tenders and a Stella. Good eating. Service started to slow when the 6pm rush hit but wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"Got the new bbq turkey burger, fried pickles, and mozzarella stick. Washed it all down with with couple Heineken. Nice eating!! Our server Megan was great."}
{"text":"HOREIBLE SERVICE. This isn't unusual for this chain, but this location is particularly bad."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was because I got my food to go or not... but my medium wings were super dry, over cooked, crunchy, with minimal sauce. I was there early to pick it up so I know it wasn't because it was sitting under a heating lamp or anything like that. Despite the look of them, the tase was decent. I had to add more hot sauce when I got home to make they saucy. Also, check out the picture of the vegetables they gave me.. this is a carrot in case you couldn't tell. Looks like an old cheddar string cheese. Ew. If I even go again, I will think about ordering something different."}
{"text":"I am from L.A so when I was able to get in with absolutely no wait it was amazing to me. I am used to waiting 1 hour to an hour and a half for a table. NOT ONLY was the seating fast the service was great too. Paige was our server and she was super friendly. Will definitely be coming back here! The assistant manager was really nice too, everyone had a smile on their face. (Also got to see a woman complete the challenge). Overall satisfaction, worth the 5 stars."}
{"text":"I like this location better then the one on centennial. Definitely cleaner and we seem to win more here if we play the video machines in the bar. If you've never been here the food is pretty typical chain restaurant. Nice staff as well."}
{"text":"The food is not bad.  I just hate that out of the last couple of visits, no one follows up to see if you need anything else to drink.  I am taking the rest of my food to go because I am thirsty."}
{"text":"I know that this isn't fine dining but I would still have liked to be greeted and seated in a timely manner. We sat there waiting, had multiple people walk by us and then finally were seated.   We ordered the sampler which was yummy and were given samples of the wing sauces. We ordered both the boneless and the regular wings. The boneless wings are good but lack sauce so I suggest asking for more. The regular wings were good but not as crispy as I would like."}
{"text":"You get two stars because you're new, Cedar Buffalo Wild Wings. I'd normally give one star for the experience I had the other day.  Three of us at a table. Two got boneless wings, I got traditional. Also got a side of buffalo chips with cheese. Food took 20 minutes to come out, which is excessive for chicken wings. Every order came out boneless. I asked them to remake mine, which they did. Both of my companions had cold food. Had it come out fresh, it would have been much better.  Midway through the meal our server took away the buffalo chips while there was still food left without asking if we were finished. We were too surprised to say anything before she was gone. Meanwhile, we had all finished our water and hadn't gotten a single refill yet.  My traditional wings came out well after my friends had finished eating. (Every wing is identical until you put sauce on. Why not just grab the next wings that come out of the fryer and throw the sauce I asked for on them?) We had to get moving quickly to get to an event, so I ate my food as quickly as I could. Checks took a long time to process, which was the icing on the cake.  Hope you guys up your game as you settle in to your new location. For now, though, I'll just go to the Winking Lizard when I want wings."}
{"text":"Definitely had lil Jon on TV might have to flip the table word da ma P.S.where is lil Jon he prolly got hoes damn man s/o lil jon"}
{"text":"Watched games here with 8 of us. John took excellent care of us despite how busy they were!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went shortly after they opened on a Saturday morning. We were surprised to see a few tables already taken. The food was good. But the service was lacking. They progressively got busier but more wait staff showed up to compensate. We felt like we were ignored after we ordered. No asking if we needed a refill until we finished our food."}
{"text":"What a disappointment, but then again a typical Buffalo Wild Wings. Was waiting for a table outside where there were 9 tables waiting to be cleaned.  When I asked the hostess about the dirty tables I was told there were only 2 servers outside....while I counted 7 for her standing near the hostess stand. She offered to get a manager for me and mentioned something about wanting to make sure we received good service. I thought it was best to go next door to Yard House where they seem to have their act together. Like I stated at the beginning, a typical Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Slllooooow service and the tablets don't work! I love playing the games! The staff doesn't give a shit"}
{"text":"Food is always good, service keeps up well in busy spells, staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"25 minutes and counting for a to-go salad. Nobody is even here. This place is poorly run."}
{"text":"I got a gift card for BWW that I was trying to use and did a pick up order. The girl who answered was so sweet and helped me pick out flavors I thought my kids and I would like, as we've never been. She was so nice and didn't act like I was a nag (I kept asking about flavors and how many pieces came with what) I will totally be back!"}
{"text":"It's a bit expensive to eat here for the first time. It's a bit expensive. I like to eat fried chicken. The other one is a bit sour. The fries are also good."}
{"text":"Astonishingly Mediocre   Alas, this experience was everything I dislike about corporate restaurants--unenthusiastic employees following a script, slow and incompetent service, uninspiring food.  While I understand that a party of 9 is a large group, the restaurant wasn't busy during our time there at lunch, and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson.  Despite being perhaps 30% full, our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver.  And the order was incomplete, one entree was incorrect, one not delivered at all.  Too bad it was wings, as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive--and these too were incorrect.  I guess other than being part of the name, wings are a difficult entree to prepare.  The waitperson apologized, then started complaining about the kitchen staff--true professionalism.  The head host (who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us) never came by to apologize.  Despite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there, the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill, which was incorrect.  We were charged for the delayed (and incorrect wings), but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree.  That would somewhat make sense, but it was not mentioned by the waitperson, so I don't know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary.  My entree was entirely forgettable (indeed, a few days later I have no recollection of what it was).  I do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy.  The two word review:  Why Bother?"}
{"text":"Visited and it was my first time. The portions are very generous. The food was great the wait time was average. If you are not a sports fan make sure you check ahead to see if there is a sports event on the night you decide to go."}
{"text":"It was cold and rainy in Scottsdale the day we visited this specific BWW.  They have a full bar so we asked for Irish coffees. The waitress had no idea what that was but no big deal she was young.  The bartender was older but said she didn't know either. She didn't offer to find out, so we ordered coffee with a Jameson's side.  BWW is know for a very good variety of beer on tap. I tried to get some recommendations but the waitress and bartender were useless on this request too.  The restaurant was not busy by any means, just a few people besides us. It took a half hour to get a small order of wings. The wings were very good and our waitress was polite but she had no support from the bartender and the kitchen was slow. It was a very poor experience."}
{"text":"My favorite location by far. Love me some hot wings and cold beer!  Great happy hour specials. The asain zing is the bomb. They have dry rubs as well. They are so so. Love the selection of sauces.   Pretzels with cheese sauce is some of the best around.   Enough TV's to keep the biggest sports fan happy! They are happy to move the games around too so your game is on the tv nearest you!!  Love that they have their names on the back of their shirts too!!"}
{"text":"Gets super busy. Wings are ok not the best. Service when busy is very slow. Price is good. Atmosphere is very cool. Loads of TVs for games perfect place to catch a game."}
{"text":"It my first time going to buffalo wild wings i was going out with a bunch of my cousins from out of town and decided to go to this spot first we had to wait to be seated for like 15 minutes and the establishment was not busy the customer service was not good at all they acted like no one wanted to work their which ticked me off i wanted to call them out but i didn't want to be rude. so after we got seated their was like 9 of us in one table outside we ordered about 10 things off the menu and the waitress was acting vary suspect thinking we were going to dine and dash.   so we waited about 1 hour for our food when they brought it out it was cold and food has to be hot in order to be safe to eat.And the employees just kept on watching us we didn't get our drinks entail our food was out it mad me so mad that these people thought we were going to dine and dash so when i was eating my food it didn't taste right so i called the waitress and told her what was wrong with my meal she said its your problem because i chose this meal and i wanted to just beat her up.   so i asked for a manger and said ill get u a different meal and i said no i want this refunded from my order because u don't no what the employees  will do with that food and the manger simply didn't want to do that .so we all got up out of our seats and walked out and said well never come back and some other things as well. do not go to this locating vary rude employees."}
{"text":"It was game day..Niners vs. Green Bay, and the time was 4:15pm.  My fiance woke me up so we can get to BWW for the 5:30pm game.  I was sooooo sleepy but when we arrived at BWW, I was so glad he woke me up to get there early.  The place was already crowded for the Broncos/Ravens game.  We waited for 15 mins before we got tables to seat 7.  After we were seated, I realized how we got there just in the nick of time because there were tons of groups after us.  The server was very attentive and friendly.  She made sure our drinks were always half full.  At a time like this, half full is good enough for me.  She came by many times to ensure we ordered everything we need.  My favorite are the lemon pepper bone-in wings.  Fiance and I shared 18 wings.  I was stuffed after 6.  Will we come back...Heck Yeah! Awesome place to hang out for drinks, wings, and the accompaniment of other fans."}
{"text":"I randomly popped into this location just to kill some time, have a beer, and catch up on my sports news. Out of all the Bdubs in town that I've been to, this one has to be my favorite.  The bartender when I was in (Arial I think) was very attentive, regularly checked to see if there was anything I needed, or if I was hungry.   It goes a long way to see a bartender paying so much attention to customers, but especially ones that aren't gaming. Thank you for the hospitality, I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My husband loves this place.  The wings never disappoint and the 5,000 tv's that have sports on are exactly what he goes for!"}
{"text":"Waited for 45 mins for food. No one let us know what any issues may have been. Asked to talked to manager 4 times  Finally came out to speak with me. Acted like he didn't even care....

This will be the last time I bring any of my groups to Wild Buffalo Wings..Still waiting for our check... Been an additional 20 minutes"}
{"text":"Horribly understaffed for st patricks and march madness. Waited 20 min at lunch with open tables, tables covered in dirty dishes and barely anyone sat. Walked out.  Poor management."}
{"text":"Go here all the time! Love the atmosphere and how big it is compared to other BWWs! Customer service is pretty good but food is always on point!"}
{"text":"Seated at a dirty table. Stood there for 6 minutes as staff walked by multiple times and said nothing.. finally sat down at the dirty table and someone came and cleaned it off.. asked what beers they had local and she said didn't know, had to walk to the bar to look at there beer as everyone else sat at the table and the waitress stood at the table waiting.. took FOREVER to get our tables drinks. Ordered food, a different waitress dropped it off. Everyone ordered wings and as she started naming them and placing them on the table with a terrible attitude, stopped telling us what they were, when we asked which wings they were she very rudely said I don't know and threw them on the table and walked off.. it was a DISASTER. I will not return, this is my 3rd time trying and it is always bad. Food was great, customer service is absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever got at a bww my food took 40 minutes to get to me The place is not even full never happen before not even when there is a game Plus the employees didn't seem to care my food was dry and had a bitter taste I do not recommend for anybody to come to this Buffalo wild wings at Metro Center ever because this is the second time it happens"}
{"text":"Worst service I have received ever after my food being so delayed the waiter brought me my food with pico de gallo when I specifically said no pico de gallo also my mac & cheese was cold, waiter was being rude overall worst service ever don't nobody come to this Buffalo Wild Wings"}
{"text":"Came here after the indians watch party, big mistake. For starters, we stood at the door for 10 minutes because our hostess was bussing a table. she tried to take us to the table but table was for a table with four chairs and we had a party of 6. we told her we have 6 people and she threw the menus back into the menu holder, rolled her eyes, groaned, and stopped off to clean another table (i wish i was exaggerating). she came back 10 minutes later to seat us. Walking to our table, every single table that didn't have somebody sitting at it was full of dirty dishes. I was confused because i'm a hostess at a restaurant and as soon as someone leaves a table, i instantly bus it, so i don't understand how every single table can be dirty, let alone it be 10 minutes to clean one. Sarah was our waitress. We waited about 5 minutes for her to greet us. She bought back our drinks and then took our orders. my party all got deserts. One would think it would be fast to scoop ice cream into a bowl,  that was not the case. It took over 45 minutes for us to get our deserts and the restaurant was not full, empty tables all around us. After she took our orders, she did not come back to our table until we had to ask another waitress for our checks. It took 15 minutes after that for our checks and when they finally came, she literally threw them into the table and walked away. She put everyone on a separate bill, even though that's not what we wanted, not that she asked or anything. It took another 10 minutes for her to come back and pick them up and another 10 for her to bring them back. My party and I had a horrible experience at this Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"This place needs to go out of business.   They skin you on the price of EVERYTHING.  The wings are small.   What's just as bad, the service is ALWAYS slow.  Meals never come out at the same time.  And, it's typical for food to take 45 minutes to get to your table.  With the competition in the area, there is no need for this place.  There are numerous spot close by where the prices, service, and food are better.   My family is done with this place."}
{"text":"Best Buffalo Wild Wings I've been to; fresh and clean food. Very well made, fresh wings."}
{"text":"I placed a take out order on Thursday night, and the food was great like always, but there could have been a few things changed that could have made the pick-up process smoother. Knowing that it was their special (boneless Thursday) night, you would assume that they would have more than just one person working the take out desk. I was told that my order would be ready in 15 minutes, so I got to the restaurant accordingly. There was probably about 6 people in front of me, and only one worker working the take out station. I ended up waiting about 15-20 minutes before I finally received my food and left. While I was waiting there, I saw plenty of other servers huddled around the bar well talking, when they could have been helping. It seemed that the only busy part of the restaurant was take out; the dining room wasn't that busy at all. Even a manager could have stepped in to help, I mean the girl looked like she was a little over whelmed. I would suggest that on your \"special\" nights (Tuesday/Thursday) you should have at least 2 people working the take out station, or if not two, then a manager should step in when it gets busy so the one person doesn't get over whelmed. Also- it would make everything go a lot smoother."}
{"text":"Just had a nice tall frosty cocktail and awesome mini corn dogs and mozzarella sticks!!  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Server was nice, but food delivery was a bit slow.  As always, the place was crowded and loud.  It was hard to watch the game.  If Don't have any crazy expectations, your visit will be just fine."}
{"text":"Wow, it was packed, I really don't see why this place is so popular!  Ohhh yea, football! I got the sampler platter, the nachos were ok, I'm glad I didn't just get the nachos!  The onion rings taste like onion rings, the fried cheese, like the onion rings, nothing to hoop and holler about. The spicy garlic is really spicy....and I like spicy, almost too spicy for me, I wasn't expecting that.   It was ok, but wayyyyyy over priced for what we got!    They won't be seeing me there anymore!"}
{"text":"What an awesome experience! I love coming to this location, all the staff is friendly and seem eager to want to serve you. Never had a bad experience. My coworkers and I also do take out from this location since it is close to work and everything is always fresh and correct! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for the evening. Place was packed as the leafs were on. Sara is an awesome bartender was prompt and pleasant. I had the buffalo wings and they we're done to my liking and spicy. Beers were cold. My reason for the lower rating was I ordered a spicy buffalo wrap and it took over 25 minutes to arrive when I asked where it was it showed up right away but the fries were cold and I was charged full price with no explanation on what happened."}
{"text":"I came to Buffalo Wild Wings for the first time and unknown to flavors, the waitress was not very helpful. She took my drink order and was dismissive about the wings specials and flavors.  The experience was significantly better once the manager came to introduce herself. She uncovered it was my first time and took the time to explain the menu, proactively offered me to sample the sauces. The food was great. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars I would!   I've eaten here many times but today was the first (and LAST) time that I order to go. My order was not ready at the designated time. Ok no sweat but instead of keeping my order warm while they make an order of corn dogs they hand me my food to hold as I wait. 20 minutes later my corn dogs are still not ready as the remainder of my order grows cold. I ask for the manager and let him know the situation. He takes my food and opens the boxes, touching my food with his DIRTY FINGERS! Tells me it's still warm.. WTF! I lost my shit and demanded my $65 dollars back.   I'll go to wing stop form now on.."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is without a doubt my favorite place for all my wing needs. Whenever I'm feeling spicy, I go in and order the hot and enjoy it with creamy ranch. Amazing flavor! Lately, my favorite has been the salt and vinegar. I recently bought the seasoning so I can cook with it at home. Great selection, great service."}
{"text":"Tonight our server was Tyler and he was absolutely fantastic we have sun with a milk allergy and he checked and verified that there was no milk or weigh in the breading for the chicken strips so that my son could absolutely be there he also made sure that we were absolutely taken care of at all possible angles my drink was never less than half empty and that is a great thing in my book much kudos to you Tyler"}
{"text":"I can't believe I never reviewed this place from my trip on 9/16/14 but after giving a poor review on service at a BW's in Michigan I read the reviews for this one and decided it's time to add to the reviews.  I showed up with my 8&10 yr old kids on a weekday and the place wasn't too busy. As far as I remember the food was fine and service was mediocre. However, what happened that night was negatively memorable.  I heard loud yelling coming from the kitchen area and some staff came running out. First thought, fire!?, robbery!? Either way I get beside my kids and grab arms ready to run out the door. The ruckus continued and all staff just looked back into the kitchen. They seemed concerned but not in an urgent way. A manager then came out and ordered everyone to disperse and got on the phone.  Our waitress came by and I asked her if everything was OK. She said, \"the cooks got in a fight and one tried to push the other in a fryer!\"  I wasn't shocked however, she did just say that in front of my 8&10 year old. At this point I boxed our food up and left as the cops were pulling in.   Now BW's was a favorite place of mine in the mid to late 90's in Mt. Pleasant Michigan. They had a good hold on college towns. As with many companies they want to grow. They need to keep their customer service and prices in check as they do this. I like the guy from The League in their commercials but that doesn't mean crap when you get bad service at high prices. I predict their growth to falter and a restructuring on the horizon."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with any of the chicken wings on the menu at the B dubs restaurants they're all fried, super crispy and tossed in a great sauce, either BBQ, teriyaki, garlic. Etc. if good for Ohio clean friendly staff"}
{"text":"Great service great food! Gary hood is the man! Will be back definitely! Also the wings are out of this world!"}
{"text":"I have been to Buffalo Wild Wings several times, and never have I been so dissatisfied until today. I thought speaking to a manager would get me somewhere but it did not; Robyn, the manager, was the least helpful, all she said was \"I'm just sorry you're done\" so there's nothing else you can do? We waited an hour for a table while we were continuously hounded about a booth and table, splitting the party of 7, no we came together we would like to all sit and eat together, the server Patrick was of no help and at the pace of a snail took one drink order, didn't deliver the food order and waited until the end of the meal to deliver our refills. A member of the group couldn't even get his order for desert in because our server couldn't be bothered. By far the worst experience ever, and the sad part was they weren't even that busy. If I could give this place a 0 Star I would. Thank you for the horrible experience, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place sucks the waitresses take to long they don't get our order right and they don't have good service they take took to long to take our order their chips are to salty I ordered the ultimate nachos and I was very disappointed I thought the food was a lot better but I guess I had my expectations set to high but either way they are terrible I'm never going again I hate their nachos"}
{"text":"We went during opening week because we had a coupon for a free \"snack size\" wing to promote their grand opening. The food was as expected. I tend to think I like spicy things. The medium sauce was not spicy to me so I'll definitely be trying the hot next time we go.   Because it was opening week the service seemed a bit off/discombobulated. When we got our food, there was an additional plate of plain wings we didn't order. The person said we could have it anyway since they already made it. Cool. Except they charged us for it at the end of the meal. The manager was very nice and removed the item from our ticket so no big deal. We all ordered iced tea. The first round was good, the refill was water! When I tried to explain that the tea was brewed wrong I got a very blank look and a replacement glass of... water. I tried to explain again that the tea was not brewed correctly and finally got a third glass of correctly brewed iced tea.   Will go again and hopefully this time all the kinks will be worked out. Is conveniently located off the 101 on Indian Bend."}
{"text":"Wow!  What great customer service. Nikki was absolutely fantastic!  Not only did she confirm and repeat our order back to us, AND she made us a fresh pot of coffee for our lunch.  #AboveAndBeyond service.  Check these guys out!!!"}
{"text":"This location sucks I've had take out from them twice and both times preordered about 2 hours before and when I came in I still had to wait 25 minutes, now besides the waiting they also got my order wrong! This just pisses me off!"}
{"text":"New to the area and I will never go back. Our waiter was terrible!! No people skills what so everyone and he had little to no training. He didn't even know what a sweet and sour was! He walked by us several times and never asked if we where ok or if we need it more drinks. When we finally got our food it was cold and we had to wait even longer to get silverware. Terrible service and food! Look for other options."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple BWW locations over the years, and was interested to see how things would be at this location.  The motif was true to most BWW locations - sports bar, multiple video screens, video games, etc.  Their signature item is their wings with multiple sauces, as well as other appetizers, burgers and wraps.  Also, they have a selection of beers, wines and mixed drinks.  Server was friendly and service was timely.  Mixed drinks seemed a bit watered down.  Fried appetizers were ok.  Sandwiches were fine, but not inspired.  Their special chocolate dessert looked better on the menu than in person.  Overall, this is typical of most BWW's I've been to, but not as good as its competition up the road."}
{"text":"This is one of a local change of sports bars.  Wings are its specialty, as you might tell by the name.  It offers a variety of sauces.  It also has a nice selection of burgers, sides, and wraps.  Good selection of beers.  Timely service.  Nice portion size for the price.  Good experience."}
{"text":"I had never been to a BWW that was anything but a disaster, food wise, but we were out cycling, and this was the best time for a break. Wife had a chicken salad thing and I had wings and a small salad and all were excellent. Even the carrots and celery were fresh and crisp.   4 stars for breaking out of the mold."}
{"text":"Decent bar food with a sports atmosphere.  Out of the wing flavors I tried I like the honey BBQ.  Ordered the sliders but not too impressed.  Meat seemed a little dry and I'm not a fan of having to assemble my own slider with the toppings.  We came during happy hour but unless your a fan of beer there was only another fruity choice as an option that night and I didn't notice any other happy hour options.  The trivia game is entertaining."}
{"text":"Had lunch there and my friend had the chicken sandwich and I had a cheeseburger with braised mushrooms. It was very good only I could not get my burger cooked medium. But then this is a fast food place. We had their onion rings which are good, but not the best and also fries. We were both quite satisfied and will continue to visit."}
{"text":"All Buffalo Wild Wings have poor to bad service but this one screws up every order and takes forever."}
{"text":"I used to love going to B dubs back in the day when they had a location down in the flats! I was excited to have them so close to the house but I've been in here 3 times and I'm very disappointed. The service is so poor. This time I walked in for a quick carry-out order that went horribly wrong.  I waited at the bar for my order and had a beer.  Shortly after I was drink my beer, someone came in and sat at the bar and was eating before I had to say something to the manager about my order. It was sitting behind the counter up front getting cold. No one bothered to even tell me my food was ready.   Unfortunately this has been a consistent level of service I'm each experienced each time I'm eaten there. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I came in on wing night to find a few things has changed.  You can order either bone or boneless wings in any denomination.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  Pretty young staff as a whole but I was surprised with how many people spoke or smile as I was being seated.  The beer selection has improved since my last visit with a mix of domestics, micros and imports.  Any franchise that doesn't carry products made in the city where they make $ won't get any of mine.  They also have a private room that can be reserved."}
{"text":"service was fantastic as usual! my boyfriend and I came in for wing Tuesday and some beer. it was moderately busy, but our server Kimberly was extremely swift and super awesome! we kinda knew what we wanted, but she made suggestions to help us make a final decision. we left with our bellies full along with our left overs. (:"}
{"text":"This location was better when it first opened now it seems like the food has gone down hill. Last time there my wife said there was no toilet paper in the womens washroom and the mens room was god awe full dirt mess! Just think its not just customers using that washroom but employees who are handling your food! Had a tall draft beer and it tasted like soap, sent it back and got another just like it. Thinking that they don't clean the tapper lines like they should be doing? This location isn't on my list of places to go from here out."}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings location is the best, most consistent location I have been to. The staff is friendly and quick, their happy hour appetizers are cheap (less than $5 for chips & queso + meat) and their wings are tasty.  I always get wings with the desert heat rub. It's spicy,  awesome and I want to buy to take home. It's not overpowering and sticks to the meat well too.  I usually a sauce too, I like mango habanero which is spicy, but could be too spicy for some. There is a fruity sweetness as well.  The potatoes wedges which are seasoned wedges with chives, you can add cheese and bacon.  Solid wing place."}
{"text":"Drinks are good, but over priced. If you're going to come here, sit at the bar. You get the shittiest service at a table. If you're looking for an intimate atmosphere, keep looking. LoL."}
{"text":"It's really too bad this location has decided to serve pre- cooked, dehydrated wings. When wings are your business, they should be fresh every time."}
{"text":"OMG. Don't bother frequenting the Buffalo Wild Wings on Centennial. We sat in the lobby area between the doors for our 10-15 min wait. No big deal, but the hostess \"forgot we were out there\". Nice. She takes us to a table, points & walks away. hmmm...ok. (We saw her do that pretty much every time she seated somebody). We sit for another 10-15 min before anyone comes over. Another 30 min later (& after the appetizer gets there), then my drink comes. No napkins. Finally the waiter takes our order. Other people come in after us, get seated first, get thier food, eat & leave & our food STILL hasn't come. Waiter disappeared. About an hour & 1/2 into it, we ask for the manager (who hasn't been seen at all up to this point). She checks on the food & disappears, too. We get up to go pay for what we DID get & are told that she can't do anything and has to get the manager. Really? She's not able to ring up drinks and one appetizer? I told her she better get on it because I would like to pay our bill & go to a place where we can get DINNER. Our waiter comes up front & says the manager is boxing up our food. FINALLY, the manager comes back out (without any food) & says our tab is good, she won't charge us. Gee, thanks. Never again.  We started going to this location after the service & food went downhill at the Montecito location on N Durango. Thier portions suddenly got a LOT smaller & food was way overcooked. The female bartender there was too busy flirting to serve us when we sat at the bar.  When she finally did come over, she was obviously annoyed by our mere presence.   I don't know what is going on with this chain, but they won't be getting any more money out of us."}
{"text":"I love their tortilla chips & salsa!  Try it next time you're there :)"}
{"text":"I'm very particular about wings. The seasoning on the wings was delicious (lemon pepper on 1/2 and the \"Asian Zing\" sauce for the other half), but they were a skosh underdone (my fault for not requesting extra crispy, but nothing that can't be fixed in my oven at home). The waitress in the bar area was very nice and courteous, if not very attentive. I will probably return at some point, prices are reasonable. Love that they have so many screens to watch a variety of games. Today I was watching soccer and basketball."}
{"text":"What is the point of ordering online and being given a time it will be ready only to show up and have to wait another 25min...  I placed the order online at 6:45, pick up time generated by BWW was 7:10. I showed up at 7:08, waited my turn and was helped at 7:15. 7:17 I was told it would be another 10-15 min. 7:45 I still didn't have my food.   The guy working Togo was very nice and apologetic but that really doesn't make up for the company not having a better system. Over an hour to get 10 wings some mac & cheese and a soda! Then my food was cold, I shouldn't say cold but it was room temperature and not a nice hot meal like we were expecting. How do you expect your employees to do their job when you have such a flawed system."}
{"text":"I have been to BWW many times before but unfortunately this visit made me not want to go back. Everything was just fine. Greeted, seated, drinks, food. There was a little mix up with the food but nothing major at all. I asked our server Kelsey for the menu because we wanted to order desert (the nachos which I've had before and they were awesome, enough for me and my two boys to share). My boys were still finishing up with their meals and my 5 year old said he had to go to the bathroom. I left my keys so someone would know we're coming back and thankfully the restroom was close. It took him not even 5 minutes then we rushed back so they wouldn't clear the table. I get back and the server began cleaning the table. When I get there she says \"oh I thought you guys walked out\", mentions that she saw my keys, put the food down then walks away. My kids sit to finish their food and I'm PISSED. Why would a server say that to their customer? Why? I obviously found it very offensive and found it very necessary to say something to her. When she came by and asked if we wanted to order anything I asked her \"why would you say 'I thought you walked out'?\" I told her I found that offensive and we did want to have dessert but will now go elsewhere. My bill came out to $36 and some change and so I had $43 which I was going to walk to the cashier, as we got up she said I have to pay her and I said good \"now you know I'm not walking out\" then she had the nerve to say \"well the dessert is better down the road anyway\". WHAT THE F**k??? Sorry BWW but you need to get your servers in check. Whether she was being a smart a$$ or not, that was unacceptable. When I asked for the manager she said \"yeah that's him, he already knows what happen\"... Brought me to him then says \"this is the lady I told you about\". So did you tell your manager that YOU F**KED UP or that I'm being a b**ch? Anyway I told him my peace and how I was very disappointed especially since I was a server and know how it is. But all in all, she got the payment for the meal and a little less than 20% tip (would would've been more had this not happen) which I already know servers live off of but if she plans on making money she needs to learn how to talk to her customers. BWW management has a lot to teach Ms.Kelsey."}
{"text":"The staff here is awesome! I work up the street from here so it makes for a great lunch spot. They are always mindful of the time and get you in and out so your back to work on time. They have deals throughout the week as well. For game nights, the energy is awesome. No better place to be for watching a cardinals game."}
{"text":"Decent place to watch football games, food is average as was the service. Slight on the noisy side. I would recommend this place to hang out, drink and watch games. The good thing is there are a lot of TVs."}
{"text":"Things have changed drastically since I last came here 6 months ago. Before then-- I was a regular. Am absolutely a regular again!!  Stuff my friends said I should not have believed. Ryan and Jay are 2 of the coolest managers around. Cam is a terrific store manager. Rex and Cheyenne-- besides the others whose names I don't know-- are all great!! So many beers to choose from.  Food and drinks are a little pricy in my books, but have tasted awesome when I get any. NFL season is sweet in here. Can get any game you want. Same for MLB and NHL. So many screens. Lots of kids quite often-- being next to Chuck E Cheese. Loud at times. Love the trivia. Wish more players would be here more often."}
{"text":"Two stars is very generous. Last two times I came my wings came out cold. Last night they were room temp, almost sauceless, and some of the smallest wings I've ever seen (I've been eating wings weekly my entire life). They looked like they had been sitting out for an hour. Service was slow but the server was apologetic. I will not be coming back. Say good bye to their traditional wing deal too. As if I needed any reassurance to never come back."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place to go. We would eat there at least once a week if not more. Service has gone downhill along with food. I'm not sure if it is under new management now or what. We waited 30 minutes for an appetizer and another 30-40 for our food. It wasn't busy so I'm not sure what happened. Props to the manager on duty for recognizing poor service and giving the meal for free. I used to love this place but drive to the Tryon location now. Better food and service."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of the wing scene in Vegas but BWW isn't too bad. I prefer to go on Tuesday or Thursday when they are .60 cents. They have good happy hour food and drink specials twice a day and this is a great place to watch sports."}
{"text":"I was there for their wing Tuesdays, which is basically wings at a cheaper price.  Except that you don't get the ranch and celery for free.  They're extra charge on wing Tuesdays.  I ordered 12 wings, 6 in their spicy garlic sauce, and 6 in their mango habanero sauce.    The mango habanero sauce was too sweet for my liking and not nearly as spicy as its position on the chart would indicate, nor as the waitress had suggested.  I like my food SPICY, and this wasn't spicy at all.  Overall, I didn't enjoy the wings very much.  I like my wings a little bit more cooked and for the skins to have a bit more crisp to them.  These were flabby, fatty skin.    Their fries however, were really good.  I had the regular and the potato wedges and they were fried just right and flavored/salted just to my liking.  When I was in the one in Columbus, Ohio, I ordered their pork sandwich which I enjoyed."}
{"text":"45 cent wings on tuesdays???yes please!!!! Salt and vinegar is my favorite for the dry wings, and Garlic Parm and Asian Zing for the wet. Mango Habanero used to be  another one of our selections, but lately, we can't even finish the order. They must've jacked up the Habanero and put less mango,.....Hmmmmmmmm....ALOHA!!!  (YELP 365 CHALLENGE-38/365) \"Buffaloes have wings!?!?\""}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(203/365) \"Tuesday Tradition\"  Tuesdays are where its at! Its just a cold drink and some tasty bone-in wings... The Soft Pretzels are pretty bomb with the cheese and mustard sauces too. Service was quick and very personable at this location.  We ordered a few of our favorite flavors-Garlic Parmesan, Asian Zing, and Salt and Vinegar.  Sports fans can watch the many screens of various games going on, and even on a Tuesday night for being very busy, our orders came out in a timely matter. Huge tasty wings, great flavor in every bite, I've never been disappointed in any BWW visit.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4"}
{"text":"SERVER AMANDA D. At the bar tables was literally the worst server me and my husband have ever had. I had to get up 3 different times because she constantly kept walking by us like we were not there. We are locals and eat once a week at the Buffalo Wild wings in centennial and I can tell you the servers in centennial are by far better than this buffalo wild wings ON THE STRIP! that's what blows my mind she was very rude, unattentive, took her 25 mimutes to bring me my 3rd beer like wow. I understand being busy but that's inexcusable. I ordered a shot of Jamerson before we left and it took her 10 minutes to bring me a shot she told me she was waiting for the other guy to pour it? Why you work at the bar and we're at the bar so why could you pour the other 3 shots we ordered and not this one, that a right because you were too busy putting cups away. I understand they have other things to do but the customer should be first and things like that should be done on down time. I expressed to her my husband knocked my coke.ober so again I had to get up and find her on the side of the bar to tell her and she brought the shot and a new coke with a wet yellow sign. She picked up the check and our total was $98 she was awful service I told my husband do not leave her a tip after I saw another couple next to.us arguing over THE SAME EXACT THING. He insisted he has to leave at least 3 dollars so she took the receipt and said oh wow yes ha thanks for the whole 3 dollars. I looked at my husband and we ended up talking to the other couple outside and they expressed to me and my husband how terrible she was to them as well. So they told us to yelp and I said most definitely. I get that bad days happen but this server was terrible and we will never return because of her."}
{"text":"terrible service; management could care less about customer satisfaction. Visited my sister in Phx last week and had a taste for wings. SAt down after the peak dinner hour, around 8pm, ordered right away and still waited 53 minutes for two 8 piece baskets of boneless wings, one of which was messed up twice, so had to wait even longer. Both orders were dry, came in the same little paper trays we used to eat tater tots from in elementary school. No plates or napkins; had to ask twice for them. I guess that is an odd request at this establishment. Asked repeatedly for celery while we waited for first order to be corrected, none came. The server was very nice and apologetic, however made no special effort to correct her mistakes, and walked with the pace of a turtle. She sent the manager over, who at first went to the wrong table saying to the family next to us; \" I hear you folks have a problem.\" When we explained it was us, and we had waited an unreasonable amount of time for our order, and that the order was wrong when it finally came his answr was; \"Huh. Thank you for bringing that to my attention.\" That was it. In addition, there were about 19 servers milling around, not one had a sense of urgency or purpose in their step. We also observed other tables in the not full dining room being ignored. Management didn't even offer us a discount or any reason to come back, as you should if you want to keep loyal returning customers. So glad i don't live there. Will never return to this location; possibly never to any location."}
{"text":"I went in asking for something relatively healthy, and they literally said \"no, this is Buffalo Wild Wings\". If that floats your boat then yeehaa to you"}
{"text":"My favorite wings! Best sauces and reasonable food prices make this economically awesome! It's also family friendly."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of Buffalo Wild Wings. I've just never had a meal there that I thought was good. Well, last night our options were a bit limited being that it was Christmas Eve so we decided to give this location a try. Well, it was as expected. The food was not my favorite.   Let me say this though. The bartender was great! He was super friendly and made sure our drinks never ran low. He gets an A++. But the food cannot be overlooked. I ordered the snack size of traditional wings with mild sauce and we started with potato wedges with cheese. The potato wedges were okay but honestly a little too salty. The wing sauce was a little spicy to be considered mild in my book and the wings in themselves were super dry and overcooked. I only took a few nibbles before deciding it wasn't worth eating.   Sorry Buffalo Wild Wings. Wish I had better things to say but after trying multiple locations I've decided your wings are just not for me."}
{"text":"Surprisingly not crowded for Panthers home game day.  The take out service is pretty slow here.  Best boneless wings in town.  Their wings will keep me coming back for life."}
{"text":"We are regulars at this location and all the servers are great. Taylor is our favorite to have. And we always love when Lauren is there. She makes our visit entertaining and memorable. These two are quite a team. Don't always order food but when we do it's delicious. We will continue to go!"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night, arrived at 7:30. No food or drinks until 8:45. If you're that busy inside, please let the folks on the patio know how long it's going to take so we don't wonder where you've gone and can decide if it's better to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It took two hours after we sat down to receive our food. This is not an exaggeration it was actually two hours. People were waiting for tables for that long too. It was awful. To top it all off the food was cold when we finally got it. The server was amazing during the entire time."}
{"text":"The worst take out service that I've ever experienced, and it looked like it was horrible service all around the restaurant. My husband loves wings, and after landing at the airport we placed a to go order. They quoted us 15-20 minutes so when we arrived I hopped out of the car to get our food... however, it wasn't that easy.  After I paid, they informed me that they still had to make the food. If they said it before I paid, I probably would have just left and went somewhere else. Since I had already paid, I waited and waited for about 20 more minutes. They kept saying they were working on the salad, but they must have had to go buy new lettuce. When they made it, they had made it wrong, and I waited about 15 minutes to have them redo it. Oh, and then I still left with the wrong salad... left with a BBQ chicken salad instead of buffalo...  While I was waiting for the food, I couldn't help but watch how disorganized they were. One table didn't have service so they got up and left. Hope this place really isn't a \"training store\"."}
{"text":"They opened at 11. We showed up around 11:10. We were given the option of wherever we wanted to sit in the restaurant, we chose the patio. Needless to say, after 15 minutes of being seated I had to go in and ask the bartender for a server. 5 minutes later, our server arrived. He took our drink order and brought that back 5 minutes later. He left and said he would be right back for our order. Another 15 minutes goes by, still no server. I had to go in and ask for him AGAIN. He was sent back to our table and took our order. We only ordered three things. Our food was brought to the table by another person and was wrong. Go figure. By this time my already lukewarm Pepsi with the generously given 3 ice cubes has gone to hot..... the server returns and we ask for our bill and boxes, we have had enough by this point. 10 minutes later we get a few boxes, after we asked for them AGAIN by another server passing through our area. Our server brought the check and I gave him my card to pay for the bill after it was corrected for his mistake. Another 10 minutes..... he brings the corrected bill and FORGETS HE HAS TAKEN MY CREDIT CARD ENTIRELY. He then states he needs to go inside and find my card. He comes back, corrected bill and my card. I sign. We leave. AWFUL FROM START TO FINISH. NO MANAGER EVER CAME. If this is the level of service that is satisfactory here then we will will no longer bother coming."}
{"text":"Good spot if you're craving some fried junk food.  Slow service if they're busy but I think it may be more of a kitchen capability issue than a service issue. Usually friendly staff.  It is a bit overwhelming to walk in to the building with 6+ employees standing chatting at the door."}
{"text":"First of all this review is only getting 3 starts because I'm so happy something is actually in this space!  They really did a complete change of the interior.  I have to say it looks pretty nice.  I went here with one other person and we sat at the bar.  There were way too many bartenders working.  This seems typical of new chain restaurants.  They hire a bunch of people when they first open and then will let a lot go after a few weeks.  The woman helping us was very nice, but she didn't know what beer was on tap.  Their beer on tap was nothing special, mostly your typical big beer companies.  We ordered a fried mushroom appetizer, chicken tenders & popcorn shrimp, and the chicken wrap.  The food was ok, the serving dishes made the food look tiny.  The prices are too much for what you actually get.  My chicken wrap was supposed to come with chips and salsa.  They forgot my chips and salsa when it was initially brought out.  It took a while to finally get them.  The chips were good, but the salsa was horrible.  Straight out of the can.  I couldn't even eat it.  I would only come back here to get a drink and watch sports.  They have a ton of TVs.  And when you want to just hang out and watch a game, the slow service doesn't matter too much."}
{"text":"Wings are awesome if you get them with sauce on the side and extra crispy (add 6 mins) and I love their buffalo chicken wrap with fries on the side.   Order may take a while, but food is soo worth the wait."}
{"text":"The place opened about 2 months ago waited for to get the bugs out so I came here with husband and son  the food was really good  had wings , sliders , chicken strips and salad   Placed order at 1225 took 20 mins. And the place wasn't even half full about 35 40 percent.   Can you imagine if it was 75 % full cause of a game plan on a hour wait.   Place is nice TVs every where so if you want to watch a game you can see it every where you sit."}
{"text":"I was in Mesa to go to the Cardinals Eagles game the next day, so we decided to come here because we have never been.   Food was normal bar food. I got the parmesan garlic wings that I thought were good, but there were like 12 different sauces to choose from. We also got the ballpark sampler. It's hard to mess up bar good.   Service was good, even though the place was packed for UFC and they had a bunch of beers on tap and never had to wait for another beer."}
{"text":"Yeah, I got suckered into Buffalo Wild Wings after a running event with some friends.  Haven't been since college...and hope not to be back!  I don't eat chicken, so maybe that was my problem.  I had some buffalo chips & popcorn shrimp.  I'm pretty sure frozen foods from the grocery store baked in my oven would have been just as good.  Others from my table (who ordered wings and such) were also complaining, so it wasn't just me.  Save your $ and head elsewhere for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Alls well when cold beer is available. This venue sticks out from all different bars and restaurants in Westgate as we all know buffalo wild wings is a great sports bar. What makes this place unique however is the quick service and availability of tables and bar space due to the open seating by the bar. Being here on a holiday or game day is a challenge to find a place to get a quick drink for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Low rating for the service. At the bar and only 5 other people and three tables with people behind me yet the bartender was super distracted.  I ordered traditional, he asked me again because he forgot to put my order in and boneless came out. He fixed it quick but had to ask for napkins went through those quick he walked by enough to know I needed more but I had to ask anyway. I even bought some sauce for the fundraiser but had to wait to pay my tab while he chatted with a server with no order then only brought my credit card slip and not my itemized tab. Sorry for bashing but disappointing"}
{"text":"Last night I came in with my family around 8ish! Our server was amazing wish I knew his name (blond curly hair dude)!! But anyways I had left my wallet with $400 in it! I for sure thought my money would be gone but to my surprise the money and wallet where both return to lost and found!! You don't really see this happen often! Food is always amazing and servers are so polite here!! I'll definitely be coming back here! I love honest places"}
{"text":"I previously went to a buffalo wild wings in southern California where I'm originally from, and to be quite honest my experience was not the best. So I decided to come here with my wife and get some wings on this friday afternoon, and I'll have to tell you that my experience was much more better. The waiter came back in a timely fashion to make sure we had what we needed and most of all the food was tasty. I gave it a 4 only because the restroom was not the best, but other than that everything else was excellent!."}
{"text":"All a pregnant girl wants is her food hot and not drowning in sauce. Oh and for her salad not to be brown. Is that too much to ask?"}
{"text":"Poor service ask for water 3 times and never got it.they charge extra for ranch dressing 60 cents so be careful. had 3 different types of wings Ultra one in one basket and could not tell which was which. they need a lot more staff training , would not return for at least 6 months."}
{"text":"I love it that they are open 24 hrs but their drinks suck!!....wings are a hit and they have great wing deals but all other food is garb!!!!"}
{"text":"Very pricy at about a buck ten a wing. 8 bucks a beer and they let kids in the bar part of the place. Server was just ok but very immature for a bar setting. Food was not bad. Nice size wings. If you just want wings not a bad menu but if your party wants more than just wings it's not great. Glad I went once."}
{"text":"Whoa, the two times I've actually been to this location has been very far a part. Although I don't remember my first time here too well, I just know there wasn't any problems. The more recent visit was great. My server, David, was an awesome dude, kind of just hanging out with us and taking care of our every need. He made it like a chill out, rather than us just being in a restaurant so that was pretty cool of him."}
{"text":"ok I haven't been here for quite some time... but I still order their hot sauce on line hahaha omg geek.. I know but who cares ... anyways.... I actually came there on a whim when I was visiting some friends that lived in henderson... and everyone and their mom knows I love hot wings, and fries... and so they took me to bww and it was happy hour! awesome.. .75 beers, and 15 cents wings... pardon me? what? 15 cent wings.. omg... freaking a.. it's going to taste like dog shit... but whatever, i was dehydrated and hungry... so i thought maybe this cheap miller will help.. hey it's 75 cents... awesome.. guys it was amazing tasty..and I got the spiciest thinking that they wouldn't be but.... my eyes were watering, and I had to lather my tongue up with ranch dressing.. which I didn't mind at all....  it was so great I had to get some to go.. why? because I wanted some for later... bad idea though because when I ate them after a night of partying. it was bad news bears.. if you know what I mean... wink wink hahahha.. but I haven't been there in a long time, but the experience was great.. they were really nice to us, and the food came speedy fast!!!! I hope when I visit in april that the experience will be the same and as tasty as I remember....."}
{"text":"Great place and very clean. Best time to go is on Tues and Thurs wing specials.....no fights break out there , like the other Buffalo Wild Wings locations. Friendly staff,  all out going."}
{"text":"I would not visit this location again. Service was extremely slow and the waitress took 30 minutes to check on us while we were still waiting on food. Ordered and appetizer that arrived less than five minutes after we ordered it. It was obviously not fresh. Maybe we were eating someone else's mistake? This was on a fairly slow Sunday night. Wings finally arrived covered in way too much sauce. Chicken strips were mostly just breading and fries were reheated and not cooked fresh. Everything was overpriced in my opinion. We had 2 tall beers, 2 glasses of wine, mozz sticks, chicken strip basket and a small order of wings with a side a crappy service for $58. Never again. And as a side note we didn't complain because there seemed to be no one that cared. We cut our losses and left."}
{"text":"They have drastically improved.  Much friendlier staff and the food is much much better. I highly recommend coming here and playing buzz time trivia is a blast as well"}
{"text":"Today is the NBA draft lottery and when I'm thinking of a sports bar with lots of tv screens this spot was the ideal location! Located outside the Metrocenter mall area, this would be my first visit at this location. Thankfully made it on time to see the Phoenix Suns select the #1 draft pick, as I ate some lemon peppered wings and macaroni cheese.  For some reason the wings did not have as much of a lemon peppery flavor as I expected. They had more of a naked flavor. Definitely not the fault of the server as she was awesome and friendly. But still disappointed with the way the wings turned out. To compliment my meal I had some ice tea and a coors light that was on special for $2!"}
{"text":"NOTE: I actually had this posted on the wrong BWW Yelp page, so I deleted that and moved it to this one.  --------  So far I have been to this BWW about 10 times, and I have nothing but GREAT things to say about this place!  First off, the service.  The service is amazing! Every person that works there is courteous, personable and fun to talk to.  Every server that we have had has exceeded our expectations on being great. They joke around with you, accommodate you in every way possible and make the experience worth while.  Next the food.  The food is always hot and comes out quickly. And the flavors of wings are great! I normally get \"hot bbq\" and it has just the right amount of spice with flavor. The fried pickles are delicious!  The beer battered onions wings are great as well, and the southwest ranch sauce is great for dipping in!    My only little quip, is that the wings are a little smaller than some other wing places, but I can look past that when they are tasty!  The big winner here are the people that make the experience a great one: The employees!"}
{"text":"Horribly slow service bad attitude has to go behind the bar to get my own napkins never again. Food took FOREVER to come out. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was not only friendly but fast.  We will definitely be going back there soon."}
{"text":"By far the best location in town!!! All of the staff at this location are attentive & hard working, and the general layout of this location is much nicer than some of the others. All of the to-go girls are especially helpful and pleasant to deal with. Especially Ashley! Ashley ALWAYS has a smile on her face, makes great conversation, gets your order right (no matter how complicated) and is one of the most positive & sweet employees on the Buffalo crew!"}
{"text":"This is the beat place to come for fight nights if you are in town. It doesn't get too busy, by busy enough !! This is my go to spot. I've met many of the staff members and they all have such a great personality. Five dollar beers, you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"We came out to Las Vegas for a weekend vacation and typically we try to stay away from places that we have back home, but I am glad I stopped at Bww. I wanted to watch the game so we ended up here and the service was amazing, way better than back home. The appetizers where brought right away and the beer did too. The waiters were so nice and constantly kept asking of we needed anything. After we decided to pay out bill they told us to sit and enjoy the game with no pressure of leaving or buying another drink. I am amazed at the awesome service we received."}
{"text":"I am always here, always that I for get to check in. I mean what can you say, it is BWW. Standard wings with good amount of sauces. Food is good but at a cost of below average service. I don't understand how standard it is for buffalo wild wings to have terrible service. I try to only go when Justin is the bartender because he always gives us the best of service from there. I sit at the bar because it is easier to be helped by the bartender over the young waiters with goldfish memory.  Anyways  Hot BBQ wings are my go to. Roasted garlic mushrooms are also delicious."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Worst BWW I've been to. I've gone multiple times, always wanting to give it another chance each time, however tonight was my last. Service staff is completely rude and have not a clue about customer service. Manager is no better. Found a hair in my wings. The restaurant is always filthy as well, tables are rarely bussed in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Great service  Food came out extremely fast  Machines odds are horrible, 4 star and that's the only reason why"}
{"text":"Honestly don't get all the negatives reviews. The service was fine, even on a relatively busy Saturday night. Dude named Marco was sufficiently attentive and friendly. Food and drinks came quickly.  No preconceived notions about the quality of food one should expect from BWW. Hot wings were same as other BWW, drinks were on par.   Positive attitude walking through the door goes a long way."}
{"text":"It has been many many moons since I have stepped foot in a BW3.  Place was big, modern and so many freaking big screen TVs. I went to order wings and was told you can not get extra crispy on wing night. Well I know the barkeep did not make the rules but  who the hell says you can not get wings crispy, I  mean how stupid is that. If they come out soggy then they will get sent back.   Anywho, I was with friends so I  did not  stage a walk out. I ordered the smallest order which is 5,  wing night  means they give 5 \"free\". Meh. The fowl arrived approximately 10 minutes later.  The  bird was pretty good. I was really surprised, the wings were large, fairly crispy and had the right amount of sauce. Notables were: Thai curry, jerk, wild, hot and blazing. I will warn you the blazing packs a good punch . I would give the about a 7 on the sushi slut spicyness scale.  Would I come back, sure, I was with a group of friends; probably not a place I would suggest."}
{"text":"Sigh. This was one of few/open choices that was walkable from my hotel. I had the black bean burger and fries. Bland and boring and only lukewarm. Then I ordered some pretzels to-go with two different sauces, got back to the hotel and, you guessed it - no sauce! I'm pissed because a to-go order is not rocket science! Of course, I should have  checked my order before leaving, but I thought the bartender/kitchen staff were competent folks. Lesson learned. Never again."}
{"text":"I just can't talk myself into a full 4 stars.  Lets start with the service, Amber was a doll and we got exactly what we ordered and the tab was 100% accurate (no small task for a 6 hour visit).  When we and others at our table got what we ordered was a different matter.  As the afternoon wore on the helpers had trouble getting orders to the correct tables.  And the young one (3) in our party had over a 1/2 hour wait for his ice cream.  I don't think they have enough staff for a football Sunday as Amber was visibly run ragged with her assigned sections.  I have had better and less expensive wings however we liked both of our sauce choices (Thai curry, Asian zing).  I actually preferred the sharing sides (Southwest bites and spinach chicken flat bread) we ordered later on.  The selection of beers was excellent.  The place was packed and noisy.  Our group ended up on the patio and it turned out to be better than we thought it would be.  Less noisy and easier to get up and socialize.  The parking lot was made for midget cars.  Overall I give this place a 3-1/2."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some friends that picked the restaurant.  They had been here before.  This was my first time at this location but had been to others on Sundays for football.  The whole atmosphere changes for weekday lunch.  I had the Black and Blue burger.  No choice in how it is cooked but it was juicy and quite tasty.  Food came out quickly and we were checked on frequently and our iced teas were kept filled.  If asked I would not hesitate to have a weekday lunch here again."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to this Buffalo Wild Wings and due to a misunderstanding between the servers, we weren't greeted for 10 minutes. I wasn't too upset, as a server myself I understand how sections can be mixed up. Still, I approached the manager and asked him if he could send a server to our table. Dave quickly apologized and offered us a free sampler of our choice. The server who was supposed to take care of us came up to us and apologized as well. Sim ended up being our server and took amazing care of us. We had a great dining experience. The staff was very friendly and Dave continued to converse with us thought-out our meal. It was obvious that the staff is full of genuine, caring people and I appreciate that!"}
{"text":"Roach crawled on our table while eating. Our waiter was nearby so when we pointed it out he immediately grab a napkin & removed it. He discounted our bill w/a military discount but honestly I think the meal should hav bn half off if not free.  It was jus my coworker on a lunch break so it wasn't a large order. We were in great spirits & busy discussing our night at work so making a fuss isn't what we do but I know this experience is a deal breaker for most so wanted to share.  The rest of our service was a 4-4.5 but the roach was kinda a big deal. Lol If they had given the meal free, had a manager come by to apologize or offered a free appetizer for our next visit then I would hav given them 2 stars. I won't come back to this location bc although it was 10pm at night, the place was packed on a Friday so that was a pretty bold roach"}
{"text":"No rating yet as we are the very first customer! Woo!!! Service is fantastic so far. Huckleberry lemonade is delicious. Okay, my son and I happened to stop by for lunch. We were defiantly outnumbered by the staff. Quit a few people stopped by to ask how the food was, top off drinks and just to check how we were doing.   I ordered the Mediterranean salad no meat, it was delicious! Fresh, lots of flavor and with pieces of warm pita and hummus it was what I needed to feel satisfied and full.   My son ordered the boneless wings, jerked and Asian spice. He loved them, I had a taste, let me just say - I'm more of a traditional, bone in, buffalo wing type of girl.   We will definitely be going back. Loved the large screen TVs. You won't miss the view of any game in this place. Try it out. It just opened and will most likely have a few bumps. They are off to a fabulous start!"}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite places to eat wings when we were in the mood.  The restaurant always looked clean, and the menu was lengthy, so depending on what you are in the mood for, they probably have something close to ease those cravings.   One thing I really like about this place is their choice of flavors for wings.  You can choose from a variety of flavors such as Sweet BBQ, Teriyaki, Parmesean Garlic, and Caribbean Jerk.  They have a very extensive bar line up, as well.  The popcorn shrimp and buffalo chips (thick potato sliced french fries) are so tasty, too. The service has always been friendly and efficient here.  It  is great for sports watching, and they sometimes have pay per view action, but there is a cover charge that usually gets taken off your bill once you order food.  For example, you might paid $10 per person to get in, but receive $10 per person in \"credit\" when you order food during the popular UFC fights."}
{"text":"I used to patronize my hometown Buffalo Wild Wings frequently up until about a few years ago for no specific reason I decided to stop in again.  And from my experience this time around I do not think that I will be returning.  A few specific reasons for this,   I visited on a late Sunday afternoon when it was not busy to have some wings and a few beers at the bar.   It was nearly five minutes when I sat down at the bar a bartender finally appeared.   I find this inexcusable, especially when it is not busy.  The bill I received is another reason,  I ordered 10 traditional wings, buffalo chips two short Sam Adams (over $6 each) and a Dr. Pepper and the bill was a whopping $31 not including tip, this is abhorrent.   I would have given a 1-star rating but the food was good.  If this place is busy, parking is an issue as well, there never is at any other BW3 location,  the owner should consider a new location in town, for a suburban location of a bar/restaurant should never have a shortage of parking but that point is moot, with these prices and meager service I will never return."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for lunch and had the best service yet. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. She went out of her way to check on my sister and I during our lunch. Our appetizer was inexpensive yet served with huge portion sizes. The food came out in a timely manner. Both my sister and I enjoyed our meal, although my wrap was very salty. Overall, it was a great experience, and I will be back again."}
{"text":"High dollar chicken!!! Gaming sucks I dropped $100+ in the machine for 3 beers and I received a bill for$5.41. As well as me bringing in @ party of 12! Wack!!!"}
{"text":"Hanna the head bartender was on top of her game, what a wonderful person to have in this position. She is definitely a great asset to Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"So I won a free a meal from a friend who was doing a little picture contest and the place was my pick, So I picked Buffalo Wild Wings, if yall haven't learned yet I love love love spicy hot food, you're thinking wings huh? I'm not the type that digs the vinegar based sauces that are on soo many wings out there. I like that Buffalo Wild Wings offers so many choices and yes even offer the vinegar based ones too!! My lips were craving the burn wanted to feel the heat!!! So I ordered boneless wings covered in the Mango Habanero sauce, its sweet and burns you at the same time!! Hot damn!! I have tried so many times at home to recreate this sauce, but yet have failed, have even thought about getting a part time job in the kitchen to master it, but yea that would take too much time and effort on my part and it's just easier going to BWW and ordering them and yes I know I can just buy the sauce by the bottle, but I'm a cooking nerd and like to try to recreate things from scratch. Next time I'm going to ask for heavy sauce!!  I also ordered the Honey BBQ Bacon Burger with coleslaw, had been craving coleslaw for a while and I got it, it was nice and cool and great for after the wings!! But I know I will be back!  In fact I already hear the Mango Habanero wings already calling my name!"}
{"text":"BW3 is a great place to sit and watch a game. I saw the Carolina and Duke basketball game there last year, and while my Tarheels lost, I still had a really good time. Their veggie burger is great, and the bar is a lot of fun. The service is fast and good, and the televisions are big without being overwhelming.   It's a typical sports bar without the ick of a typical sports bar."}
{"text":"the wings were great.. the place is hidden a bit, but the bartender was awesome.. and the restaurant was extremely clean. thx bww !"}
{"text":"Best experience at BWW thanks to our server Bryant. Super friendly and didn't make us feel rushed at all. He was extremely busy and he was great under pressure and got the job done."}
{"text":"It was very very busy but that's not an excuse to serve raw chicken along with disgusting floors covered with chicken bones."}
{"text":"This b dubs was terrible! First off, I came in today at a slow time. There was a ton of empty seats, and so me and my friend asked to be seated. Three of the hostesses couldn't figure out where to seat us. It was empty not that hard to find a seat!! So we are finally seated, and our waitress was so rude! Hopefully Crystale is not your waitress. She didn't say hi or introduce herself just asked for you drinks. She slammed the drinks down than walked away, when we were ready to order. Crystale finally Cameback after nearly 10 min and was rude taking our order. And talking to the table next to us in the middle of us ordering! We then got our food and my friends tenders had barely any sauce when they were suppose to be tossed in sauce. I couldn't eat half of my tenders because they were fatty and disgusting. We had our food for only several minutes and she put down the check and said nothing. We wanted separate checks but she didn't bother to ask. So rude and will not be coming back here!"}
{"text":"A friend asked me to meet him at Buffalo Wild Wings for a beer and some wings.  I can honestly say that there was not one positive part of my experience.  The service was terrible - I'm pretty sure our waitress had been drinking.  She was inattentive and slow.  The wings came out and were average at best.  The celery & carrots had a brown slimy coating, so I returned them & a food runner brought back a new basket of celery & carrots with the same slime on them.  GROSS!  My friend bit into his chicken finger, and found a small metal screw in his food.  We called a manager to the table, who was mildly apologetic but only took the chicken fingers off the tab.  Our friend was served food with a foreign object in it - That could have been extremely dangerous...You would think maybe a beer or 2 would also have been on the house....but NO.  Instead, the manager told us how much he didn't like his job and how he was looking to get back into bartending for his career (as if we cared!) I hate to sound harsh, but this restaurant is trashy and a waste of space.  If you want amazing wings, head over to Johnny Macs in Henderson."}
{"text":"Table of 3 on Saturday March 25 around 8pm.. Well the service was terrible. . the host this night took us to a dirty table. . that waitress brung one glass of water when clearly all 3 were empty. Her hair was too damn long and should have been pinned up.. She reaching all over the table and my food.. I couldn't enjoy my meal i was pissed... First time at this location and will not be returning"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my parents and fiancé for lunch today. I ordered the blazing wings, my fiancé had garlic, my dad had traditional, and my mom had the salad. We also had sides of fries and macaroni and cheese.  Food is decent -- reasonably priced, pretty salty, a little fatty, but good ol' sports bar food. I think the location has very little to do with that. The wings aren't very saucy so you might want to ask for extra sauce on the side, if you're into saucy wings.  Service was very good -- the server changed the TV to the World Series of poker for me, kept coming with drink refills and napkins and extra sauces without batting an eye. Was also seated and waited upon quickly.  Overall a good meal for the price. It could be better, but for the price, it's a good value."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Buffalo wild wings branch I have ever been in. The staff, cook are very bad in service and their food quality. I simply ordered a cheeseburger and it was the worst ever cheeseburger I've ever tasted. The beef clearly was not fresh as I can tell that it was refrigerated. Even the store smells so bad that they use chlorine.I'm shocked it is given 2 and half stars where it should be given nothing.  I wouldn't recommend this branch even to an enemy."}
{"text":"Pathetic. The dining room was half full at most yet I waited 20 minutes without a server coming to my table. I left with an empty stomach. How does this happen?"}
{"text":"After having a bad experience at wild wing cafe, I came here and boy were your wings 10x better!!! Awesome service better food. Keep it up"}
{"text":"For a chain or restaurant in general with \"wing\" in the name, this place really doesn't impress.  If all you're looking for is standard draft beers, mediocre wings and sports, sure it'll fit that bill but it won't stand in any discernable way.  Wings are just average sized. Selection of sauces is good, the hottest is pretty hot but not extremely flavorful. I suppose it's just there to burn you twice, you know what I'm talking about.  I won't go on promoting a bunch of local bars or chains locally that do the same thing with wings, beer and sports. Oh okay, I will; Hazelwoods, Native New Yorker, Zipps and Tweakwoods all do some/everything better than Wild Wings."}
{"text":"I went here to watch the boxing match between Mayflower and Marquez. The food was good, we sampled 4 different favors of wings and they all had a great taste and texture. Our service was great and the place was packed - though we got there super early and had great seats in a booth. The manager came to our booth during one of the preliminary fights and told us that since we were in a booth they were going to move people to sit with us (she said something about it's a requirement to have 4 people to a booth during these kind of events). I was a little annoyed, but if that's policy then I didn't mind so much - plus it would have been cool to meet some new people. However, people never came. I don't know if there just wasn't as many people as the manager had expected, or the groups were big and didn't want to lose two people to come sit with us. Either way we ended up having our own booth the whole time, which we preferred anyways.   The fun for the crowd really started during the main event, there were whoops and yells and cries of defeat or success. Super fun - and what really topped off my experience was the bathroom! Clean, roomy with a sitting couch and cute mirrors all over the place. It smelled good too.  I would definitely come to a Buffalo Wild Wings for a big event like this any time!"}
{"text":"Thank you BWW for the energetic atmosphere during football season!! When I don't plan right, I get the crappy table on the side, under the TVs but you have SO many TVs I can still watch my Bears from any angle! The food is super greasy and I never feel good when I leave, but I'm not going there for the food - I love the united and random screams and shouts and I will continue to put my stomach through the ringer just to be a part of all the commotion!"}
{"text":"Bdubsssss! This is one of the only wing chains that usually doesn't disappoint.  They got specials weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays for wings.  They got awesome beer on draft and amusing bartenders.  They got more tv's than best buy so you'll never miss a shot.  I've been here quite a few times since I moved down the street.  The staff here are all friendly and are usually on their A game.  We stopped in here yesterday and had an awesome server. He came when we needed him and helped us wipe up some spilled beer on the table lol. (my bad)  I totally recommend the salt and vinegar dry rub wings.  They come out crispy and taste exactly like the chips.  The wedges here are quite delish and the onion rings are bombbb.  Stay away from everything else though . Burgers are mehhh and the salads are mehhh.  All in all if your in the area stop in and get your wing on! Friendly staff, good beer, and a fun atmosphere that isnt too loud."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest, buffalo wild wings is my ALL TIME favorite place to eat! The issue with this location is that they just can't get it right. It's not every server here, the ones who have worked here for a while aren't bad.. but this location has such high turnover that it's ridiculous. The new staff is always rude.  Today was the final straw for us to come and sit and eat at this location. We'll gladly take a 5 minute extra drive to Warm Springs. They are super close to my house so I would still use them for take out, because the double check the orders before you take them home. At least at home I don't have to deal with rude servers. Tuesdays are busy, we understand, but we asked for a booth and we waited our time for it. They sat us at a table and we had stated that we requested a booth and had pointed to an open booth that was just being cleared. The gentleman than stated that the booth was for a party that had just walked in the door and put their name on the list WELL after we had been waiting.  We had asked how that was so when we had been waiting and he brushed us off and had us seated at the table right near the door. This was unacceptable. We saw another booth being cleared and requested to change to it immediately. Finally, they obliged. At this point, the waitress seemed annoyed and barely came back to check on us. I never received a refill on my water (ridiculous).  The only reason this is receiving 2 stars is because I love B-dubs food. The service sucks at this location. Try your luck elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have to agree with previous posts. Sorry I decided to purchase from this business.  I ordered chicken wings with the sauce on the side (Mild Sauce).  I was given hot sauce in 3 cups that were all marked mild. Please check before leaving. I called and was told to return the wings.  Unfortunately I placed a double order and my family was greatly disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered the 24 wings (8 honey bbq, 8 lemon pepper, & 8 hot).  It is nice that they can split up the wings that way and everyone get their own flavors.  I loved my lemon pepper wings.  YUM!  I ordered and shared a flatbread pizza:  Garlic parm chicken.  Right on!!!    The served was ok.  We had to ask for refills."}
{"text":"Super expensive, can never get service takes FOREVER! Good wings but not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this restaurant!  We usually frequent it during happy hour or before a movie, and enjoy the nachos and/or quesadillas.  We ALWAYS have exceptional service, and most recently, Suzie has been our server in the bar area.  She's the most pleasant server we've had in a long time, and I felt she deserved to be mentioned here.    In addition to remembering what we drink each time, she's always quick to ask us if we'd like another before we have to ask her. Also, if we request a side of hot sauce or ranch or anything else, she or another staff member are always quick to bring it to us.  The other staff members are equally friendly and helpful, and the food is always fantastic. Being vegetarian, it isn't always easy to find quality meat-substitutes, especially in a sports bar and chicken restaurant, but BWW has a tasty selection served with a smile.  Thanks, BWW, for always assuring a great experience with a super staff and excellent food.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love it already!  Had to go on the grand opening as we'd been anxious for this BW's to open since we first saw the sign that it was coming!  They were BUSY at 11AM and they didn't miss a single beat!  Servers were friendly, smiling, attentive, and seemed genuinely excited to be there! The vibe is awesome there, the layout with the TV's and decorations were excellent. Every other restaurant in this building has closed within the first couple of years, however I'm betting with this Buffalo being here, they're in for the long haul! Keep up the excellent work, we look forward to coming back! :)"}
{"text":"We came in with 3 children and during an nfl game. I was very surprised it wasn't packed in here. I ordered the buffalo chicken flatbread and it was really good. Our food came out quick. And the server was nice. We've been here before and have never had a bad experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I just got back and they messed up my order, so they had to remake them.  then I asked for a order of fries 3 times and I still didn't have them by the time I was done eating. Food was great service was horrible. Me and my family eat here all the time and  we've never had any issues"}
{"text":"Well we gave Buffalo wild wings another shot and I'm glad we did. Our server Emma was amazing. Kept our drinks filled and checked on us numerous times. The manager Brandon came over a few times to check on us as well and we had a much better experience this time."}
{"text":"Went there during the night as me and my friends asked to get seated outside. As we were walked to our table we had to wait for them to clean it as we all stood there in the way of everyone until they finished cleaning the table which they did a terrible job at as the table was left sticky and gross. The table should have been cleaned and ready for us before they Took us to it. Took the waiter 20mins to come and greet us to ask us what we wanted to drink which I think was way to long as we started to feel like we were just being ignored. This was my first time here and probably my last. The food was good but the service was terrible which is a shame. I would recommend eating at the other restaurants around there."}
{"text":"Overcooked pita chips.. Never nade wing extra wet either waitress forgot or cook forgot... I dont know.. Bunch of kids working this place"}
{"text":"I probably like this location the most, it's has plenty of windows so you're not sitting in the dark, there's actually space between each table and there's plenty of tv's to accommodate watching sports for football sunday.  I ate in the bar area, they carry the full menu, full bar, tons of tvs on every wall and there are plenty of waiters in that section. I order a black bean burger, not made in house however :( so its was kind of small and ordered a side of buffalo chips because they're MY FAVE! I don't recommend their fried pickles, they're heavily battered and don't seem to be cooked all the way through. I've definitely had better.   I will say i didn't love that i often saw my waitress either eating a meal at a near by table or sitting at the bar chatting away with what seemed like friends or coworkers that we currently off. Otherwise the service is good."}
{"text":"I enjoy BWW for the wings and the jerk chicken sandwich. This particular one tends to have too many young children running around the bar but besides that it is s solid sports bar. I wish they still played the UFC fights as I always went and spent a good amount of money for those. The waitress claims the owner did not feel they made money out of having the fights. They usually got at least $60-70 out of me and my wife during fights that they lost since they stopped a while ago."}
{"text":"The server took too long to take our order. Moving slow with no urgency. On top of that it took 45 minutes to bring us our 40 wings. And the server took long on bring back my bill. But the food was good. That's the only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of one."}
{"text":"WORST service EVERRRR!!!! from hosts to servers to whoever else those people are who stand around doing nothing!!!! management is horrible as well .. suckie, suckie, suckie!   seriously, go somewhere else.   so... now, a couple months after my original review, i am being contacted by an obvious fake acct \"Rocky R.\" calling me all kinds of vulgar names telling us to stay away... LOL- yes, we will gladly stay away from a disgusting establishment such as this one...   im just curious to know whos behind the fake acct?? an employee? a mgr? either way, its just more proof at what a low-class place this has turned into!! yuuuccckkkk"}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service ever ! I get it it's Vegas and I'm sure they experience a lot of stuff with customers, however don't treat everyone the same. Nor treat anybody a rude way either, this is the job you picked not the customers Suck it up if I oh don't like your job then quit"}
{"text":"Food came out cold!  Also the taste was off on the wing sauce and they wouldn't exchange it for another sauce so I wasted money. The management seems rude! I recommend not going here."}
{"text":"Went here to meet up with some friends for supper. Wasn't really feeling wings, so I opted for an appetizer of fried pickles and  Pepper Jack Cheeseburger with buffalo chips. The fried pickles were good and a majority of the table enjoyed them, but the burger was nothing to write home about. Very bland and sort of overcooked.  The restaurant has a sports bar vibe and is a little too loud to enjoy good conversation with old friends. I guess it would be more suitable to have a few beers/wings and enjoy a game. Too chain-y for me though.  The service was very good considering the large size of our party. I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"So I love coming here and sitting at the bar because Todd gives us nothing less than the best customer service, it just sucks when he leaves half way through our meal and we get a guy like Colby, he brought us napkins after we finished our chicken, he didn't pay any attention to us. Never acknowledged us or anything.. then to make it worse he complains to a manager about how he hates being here... yeah... if there was a way to get Todds schedule I would only come when he's here because this guys got me convinced he's the only one who enjoys her job besides Michelle, she brought us out our food and she was so nice and presentable. Thanks Todd and Michelle for making my visit, Colby on the other hand should find a new line of work"}
{"text":"Terrible.  Writing this review while I wait.  Husband and I ordered our food at 6:30pm.   Wings, salad, naked tenders, Mac n cheese came out at 7:10.    Immediately I knew that the naked tenders were not \"naked\" and grilled.  They were breaded and fried and someone scraped off the breading but left half of it on the plate.    Our server took it back and said she was sorry.  14 minutes later still waiting.   No apology from management.  My husband is done eating while my 15 month old and I are still waiting.    This place is absolutely terrible!"}
{"text":"Almost $20 for a combo meal and a 15 minute drive to pick it up. We open up to find $9 worth of food. This amount of food is what we would have gotten had we gone into the restaurant.... This is hardly $17.50 worth of food and really disappointing. I won't be ordering take out ever again."}
{"text":"Service was very slow even though the restaurant wasn't busy. Plus didn't get what we ordered. Avoid"}
{"text":"My local BW3 and I dont follow the bad service reviews.  Everyone at this location is always very friendly to me.  I do think the value for food overall is not good.  The buffallitos, which I have been ordering for close to 20 years, contain maybe half the meat they did years ago, but if you go for just wings like I did today they are still worth the visit.  They are more expensive than most places but also quite large, well cooked and the sauces as always are excellent.  Always consistent on the wings."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few \"b-dubs\" and this one is alright.  It's usually pretty packed here (I guess it's because the last few times I went, we were there for tuesday wing night lol) so we usually have to wait for a while to get seated.  I usually opt to getting the \"veggie\" burger for the non meat eaters and it was pretty good.  The last time though the burger was cold so I was a bit bummed that I had to eat a partially frozen burg.  Nonetheless, it is nice to have an option in a restaurant where wings reign supreme.  Also, the trivia aspect of BWW is a nice touch.  It keeps everybody engaged on the table plus it makes the wait for the food seem a little shorter.  Good times and good wings (so I hear).  Maybe next time they'll make my burger a little less cold and make me a little more happy."}
{"text":"So annoyed.  What happened to customer service?  Called b-dubs after midnight no manager available.  Ordered 50 wings and wanted more than 2 flavor of wings. The guy working Matt wasn't rude per say but wasn't trying to be helpful either. You would think spending 100 bucks on wings they would try to accommodate a customer but no.  They just lost a customer. I know wing stop appreciates there customers and would have gotten wing stop but they are closed.  I don't think asking for an additional flavor that they have is unreasonable I would of paid an additional for it. 50 wings 2 flavors....really bww????"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this b-dubs every Thursday for the boneless wings promotion for almost an entire school year. The food isn't incredible, but definitely above average for a chain. They have a wide variety of sauces that honestly make the food. If it weren't for flavors like Asian Zing and Thai Curry I wouldn't eat there. Indeed, the only wings I've ever had and actually like were at this chain.  The boneless wings are a little expensive if you don't go during the promotion, but with the deal they're not bad. You can fill up for a little over $10. The atmosphere is your typical sports bar so it's a little on the loud side, but overall not too bad. It gets busy during dinner time, and if you're unfortunate enough to go during an Illini game or major league draft you'll probably be waiting a while. You can control the music with the Rockbox app, which is fun in a group since you can all upvote someone's music to the top of the queue."}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on here. I was shorted on my wing order. When I noticed and brought it to the servers attention...he totally freaked and said he needed a manager. I got the impression this wasn't the first time for him. It sucks but you might wanna double check your order here."}
{"text":"Fried pickles!  Yum!  The mild wings were tasty and mild enough for my children to eat.  They had a nice selection of beer on tap.  Will come back for beer one day."}
{"text":"I took my family to Buffalo Wild Wings on 2/20/16 at 2 p.m. The waiter \"Dallas\" was very pleasant but very overworked.The drinks took to long and the food took to long to come out. The waiter \"Dallas\" was to busy with other customers to bring out our food. My carrots and celery were left out of my order. I had to ask for them before I left. I was not offered silverware. I asked the bus person for lids for my ranch she never brought them, I had to ask the waiter \"Dallas\" for lids. Food was satisfying, but overpriced. I had to go to the cashier \"Manager\" to pay for my check.This Buffalo Wild Wings need to work on team work among employees.There should have been a bus person serving beverages to relieve the waiter \"Dallas\" to take orders and serve food. I will not be visiting this Buffalo Wild Wings again."}
{"text":"How dare people give this place three stars. Great wings, beer and sports all day everyday. Sometimes the workers can be slow and have their off days but who cares. Just get me my wings and put the game on. Recommend asian zing, garlic Parmesan, and lemon pepper. I always order a large chili cheese fries to go with my wings. Go Texans."}
{"text":"DISCRIMINATION AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS! We were at this location on a Sunday afternoon to watch the browns game and were treated horrible by management. Although the restaurant was pretty much empty the entire time they refused to allow our party to use additional tables and chairs. They said it is a company policy that whoever you come in with are the only people that are allowed to be served. When we explained that we had additional friends join us they went as far as to say that wasn't their problem. We were buying a large amount of food and drinks but they refused to accommodate us. There are so many great bars in Cleveland to have fun and watch game don't waste your time at this location for sure."}
{"text":"I understand that this is a casual restaurant bordering on fast food, but I got the worst service ever! Went here after a Panther's home game to have some drinks, wings, and catch a few of the other games on the TVs. Requested the patio and were walked halfway through the restaurant before the hostess just pointed, \"it's back there\". Well yeah, we were just there except there was a huge sign that directed us to the hostess stand to be seated. We sat ourselves and sat, and sat, and sat. We watched as three servers moved through the section, looked at our table and walked away. Shift change and they didn't want another table? After about ten minutes, the manager stopped by to see if we had been helped. We ordered through him because we didn't know when we would actually see another server. About ten minutes after that, Orlando stopped by to verify our order. You mean you haven't even put our order in? Rather than get drinks, cause who knew when we would get them, I ordered a Coke.. Which I never got. Food arrived (cold) and I asked for extra sauce. My girlfriend realized she also wanted extra spice just a minute after he left the table, so she pulled one of the other servers aside to ask for more water and a side of the salt and vinegar spice. The sauce came at about the time that I was finishing my last wing. Orlando asked if we wanted boxes, I said yes, my girlfriend AGAIN requested a side of the salt and vinegar spice. Waters were never refilled. Ever try eating hot wings with no water? I was chewing on my ice. The manager stopped by as I was finishing my glass of ice to see if we wanted more water. Actually, we wanted water refills, a Coke.. on second though nix the Coke, a side of salt and vinegar spice, a box, and a check. Orlando made his third appearance at our table with the check. The patio was half empty. There were five tables between three servers.. Although one of the servers had her family in her station, so she spent her time chatting with her one and only table. Seriously? Give me hot food and keep my drink full, that's all I ask at a sports bar.. apparently, too much to ask at BWW.   Visited October 2011"}
{"text":"My first time at any Buffalo Wild Wings and the verdict: Better than Hooters for sure. The wings we got had some real meat on them and were pretty huge O__o.  The sauces are definitely all on the sour side, but the meat was actually really juicy and piping hot!   Atmosphere is great, and you can see TVs at any angle, perfect for sports fanatics c: they also had some yummy fries but lets be honest its hard to go wrong with fries"}
{"text":"We just went in for lunch. We took a seat in the bar, and sat for 10 minutes without anyone greeting us or even stopping by to find out if we had even been greeted, so needless to say we left. This certainly isn't the first time we have had a poor experience at this location!"}
{"text":"They've actually built a new store that's almost right across the street from the previous one. It's awesome inside. Although I didn't eat when I went to the new one, the service seemed pretty good and the servers were very prompt."}
{"text":"One of the worst sports bars as far as customer service goes. The Mayo/Scottsdale rd location in Scottsdale, AZ has the rudest managers, servers and hostesses. I will never return and will use yelp, Facebook and all other resources at my disposal to let everyone know!  Horrible, terrible, pathetic service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Typical bar type food but the staff are very nice. The owner is an awesome person who gives back to her community!"}
{"text":"When I called in my order at 7:23pm, the woman on the phone told me my wings would be ready in 15 minutes. l arrived at the restaurant at least by 7:55 (maybe earlier) expecting to pay and have my food handed to me right away, but instead the gentleman asked me to take a seat and wait. Around 8:10pm I got up and just as I was about to ask the woman working the register about my order another woman came out with my food. In front of the woman working the register I opened up my wings to check the temperature. My first order of wings was definitely warm to touch, not hot, and lacking sauce. My second order of wings was a bit warmer to touch but to me it was obvious my wings were not fresh. And since they weren't fresh I don't see why my food wasn't just handed to me when I got there. The older woman who I was explaining my wait time and frustrations to definitely empathized and had I made a bigger deal about it maybe I could have stayed for \"better\" wings. But I didn't. I came home and warmed wings in the oven. I wasn't given napkins or silverware or the blue cheese I was offered and accepted or my receipt. I would be more understanding if they were busy, but they weren't.  Just careless. Not once in the 15-20 minutes I was there did anyone assure me my food was coming out nor did they apologize for the wait. I even made eye contact with the man who rung me up and not once did he go in the back to check on my order."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is awful!  Every time we want to go there, we always think of bad service!  One time they took an hour to serve us and it wasn't even busy!"}
{"text":"Bdubs Bdubs, the only consistency I have found when dining at Bdubs is slow service and poor quality of food.   Bdubs amazes me to take their time to take our order and serve us food. The group that I was with waited 20-30 minutes to get our orders taken, and then almost another hour to get our food. In addition, the food itself is greasy and lacking flavor.   Bdubs is the place to visit to watch TV, and spend money on overpriced, low quality food."}
{"text":"Great service. Happy hour was amazing entire bar staff was great. Super friendly. My favorite BWW"}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment.  This was my first visit to BWW.  I ordered 10 boneless wings, half BBQ Hot, the other half Hot.  I also ordered the Pepper Jack Cheese Steak Wrap with chips and salsa.    The sauces on the wings were what I expected.  The Hot wings were the perfect temperature for me, I like my nose to run a bit with a hot flash here and there.  Downside, heavy breading covering the chicken.    My wrap was Ok but for $10+ I would hope for more.    The chips and salsa \"side dish\" was unspectacular.  The salsa lacked any character and chips were plain.   I've had better luck taking it off the shelf at Wal-Mart.    The food was typical chain food and wasn't that great.  The atmosphere was good, plenty of TVs and variety of programming that was necessary as I had to wait 15 minutes for the check and to pay with my debit card.     If I go back again I'll just have wings and will try bone-in next time.  My son reported his cheeseburger slammers tasted like McDonalds. He only ate one out of three. His comment leaving was, \"we don't need to come here again.\""}
{"text":"Exotic!  Ok it's next to the condo and a easy place for lunch. I hope the Thai curry sauce is as good as it is back home. The place is huge with loads of tvs. Friendly server and happy hour m-f 2-7 and the awesome Vegas hours of 10-0600. Amazing!"}
{"text":"No stars for this place! I went there on Wednesday kids eat for$1 .. We got there and the assistant manager asked how many we where and I said 8, she mouthed\"wow\" they  sat  us down and the waiter took a while to come over.  When she does, she tells me I need 4 adults ( w/ ID) for the 4 kids meals I'm getting, I told her why do I need iDs if I'm paying for 4 regular meals n  4 kids meals isn't that the same... I just got \"that's what the manager told me \"not really keeping their word on that deal are they! I left to a different location (Craig ) and had a total different experience!"}
{"text":"If your online receipt says your order will be ready by 630pm and you arrive at 630pm you should expect your order to be ready when you get there.  Not waiting a half hour.  And then the order is screwed up (fries instead of wedges i ordered) they screw that up too. And whats with having unlv game on one of the hundred tvs and with no sound?  There wasnt a GK game on. Think im taking my business to wingstop from now on. The wings and fries are much better there."}
{"text":"Im done with this place.  Constantly putting me on hold not once, not twice, but thrice.  Service sucks when you get there to pick up order.  Im taking my business to wingstop."}
{"text":"Okay....I rarely give 1 star reviews on Yelp, but if you are a fan of Buffalo Wild Wings, trust me, there are FARRRRR better locations than this one. My fiancé and I are an interracial couple, I am Caucasian, he is African American. 90% of the staff at this location is African American, from observation. The whole time we are sitting at our tables, we are receiving nasty looks from waiters and waitresses, they are having little side conversations and whispering while looking directly at us, and the racism we experienced at this location is unreal. On top of that, our serve was so inattentive, I almost had to get up and walk to the nearest drink station to refill my water several times. I ordered boneless wings, I received traditional. My fiancé ordered a wing flavor, he received something different. The welcome we received was very lackluster. The staff only seemed to care about socializing with one another and playing with their phones. When we approached management about the issue, they seemed like they could care less. It was horrific what we experienced, and I do blame the management of this facility. We will NEVER visit this location again, and I hope folks see this review and take it to heart. There are WAYYYY better ways to spend $30 for two people than to visit this miserable establishment."}
{"text":"I'm just going to make this quick.... bloody wings are the absolute worst! Especially after looking forward to your first meal in 8 hours."}
{"text":"I went there tonight for the first time. The food took a while to come out but our server was really nice and the food was delicious! Try the street tacos for an appetizer."}
{"text":"Horrible service on a Thursday night. It was busy due to playoffs and our waitress was very nice. She was however overtasked. 30 min average for a beer and the food was served cold. I will not go back."}
{"text":"I went to watch the Panthers MNF game and although they were extremely packed, the entire crew had everything under control.   I waited less then they originally quoted which was nice.   Their prices are on the high side of fair.  Same pricing as Fox and Hound, similar food too."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! Waited a half hour for drink order to be served and then an another hour for food to be served. And then the food came out cold. Restaurant is located directly across from theater where we had tickets to an event on a Saturday night. It is also a busy college town. A busy Saturday night should not be unusual or an excuse for poor serve or kitchen backup. The manager basically called us liars saying it had not been an hour wait for food. He also never apologized for the inconvenience. Will not ever go there again!"}
{"text":"Just left, I have to say my food of the black bean patty and onion rings were very good. My husband ordered boneless wings with parmesan and garlic sauce. They came out without sauce, he sent them back they came back hard as a rock, but they had sauce. We sent them back. We're guessing the manager came over, we said they came hard as a rock, he said he cut them with a spoon. What??? What he should have said is, I'm very sorry, I'll be happy to make a fresh order or would you like something else? What happened to customer service. First time and last time, so much for caring about repeat customers. BTW, we stopped at KFC for tenders, he said they were great."}
{"text":"Food here is great but service is sketchy at best. I just left after sitting for 15 minutes at a high top with no one offering me a drink or checking on me. Apparently 5, yes I counted, 5 servers would rather hang out at their main terminal checking Facebook than serve their customers. Lucky for me, five guys is in the same commercial center."}
{"text":"My friend and I sat at the bar to watch the Blues game and have dinner.  The bartender was awesome. Her name was Ashley and she was nice and knew her stuff. I had a Bloody Mary and it was killer, the Strawberry Mango Margarita was really good too. For dinner we had the cheese curds they were so good but the portion was small for the price. For dinner I had the fish tacos, they were ok kind of blah. Overall though great service, awesome drinks, and decent food."}
{"text":"I have been going to this bbw for several years now. This place keeps getting better and better.   Last time my boyfriend and I went to go eat was several weeks ago. We had a nice server but after she seated us she never bothered to check up on us. But yet again she was the only one cleaning while the other servers were gossiping. That is the only \"problem\" (I guess) that I found in this location.   The food is always great! Always prepared on time. Piping hot fries and wings. I always get Asian zing and honey bbq btw   The new remodeling is fantastic! Way better and more convenient. I love this location!"}
{"text":"I went to this BWW on a Wednesday prepared for a wait there were two Caucasian young hostesses one with long braid told me it would be a 30-40 min wait, which was a lie because I went to the restroom for 5 mins when I came back and sat down I noticed some people waiting were gone but looked over that and continued waiting after all she said 30-40 mins right? 10 mins passed and they sat a family who was after us, therefor we asked if we had been called and said \"yes a while ago sorry\" Excuse me? I went to the restroom for 5 mins on a 40 minute wait and you called me? Unacceptable I said nothing more although I believe she added me on the list again and just left to another location. Also, hostesses were very chit chatty with each other and \"friends\" that had came in to eat. Not very pleasant to see when you're waiting to eat and the person who has to seat you is having a friend reunion. Train them better bww. You're a very busy location there is always something to do in a busy restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to many Buffalo Wild Wings. This one is by far the worst. Servers are not great. Went in a few times, one of those a server was high. Next was a server did not check on the table at all. It's not clean, and the food sucks compared to other Buffalo Wild Wings, including  ones out of state."}
{"text":"I can't say I was impressed but there were a few things that really made me cringe.  1. My Mediterranean salad was not one, it was a POOR imitation. No dressing, not even olive oil and vinaigrette...it was DRY.  2. My child's MILD wings were wicked hot, she was in near tears and I had to share the chicken on my salad so she would eat.  3. My other child's salad was, in his words, \"meh\". 4. My husband fish was greasy and overcooked.  We were on a strict schedule so there was NO time to reorder or complain.   If you are going for a beer to watch the game on dozens of screens and eat nachos, this place IS perfect.  As for us, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"David, David, David.  Ask for David. Finally after 2 years in AZ i was able to have a great time at buffalo wild wings, thanks to David.  He was extremely helpful, the wait was over 40 minutes and he managed to quickly get us a Table withing 10 minutes.  Exceptional Customer Service by David, he was very attentive to our needs and didn't miss a beat. Thanks David."}
{"text":"It's like going to a grill & bar. They do have a bar, and I hear the place is packed on major sporting events aired on TV. They have a great variety of wing sauce flavors, and you can get as few or as many wings as you want. They have both regular wings and boneless wings. The menu also has a great variety of salads, appetizers, desserts, drinks, burgers, wraps, etc. The place is kept pretty clean, and the inside does not reek of cigarette smoke. The service at the bar (during lunchtime) was not good though. When I said I was ready to order, she stepped over to the computer/cash register and looked over her shoulder at me and waited for me to tell her what I wanted. Too lazy to step over closer to the customer to take down the order. Then I handed my credit card over to pay, and she just put it down next to the computer. Then she went to stack some cups, knocked them over on the floor to the other side of the bar. She walked all the way around to clean it up. Went to the back into the kitchen for a while. I got my card back about 20 minutes later.  Overall, I would visit again, only to sit at a table."}
{"text":"Usually have to wait 30 minutes for food. Hard to get a hold of service. Besides the wings, everything is subpar, but 4 star wings. Also, great beer selection and drinks."}
{"text":"If it was noon (lunchtime) on a Sunday when the NFC championship game was playing........don't you think they'd staff appropriately knowing that there would be a crap load of people?  Not BWW.  We were seated quickly, then waited 15 minutes and no one came over to us at all.  I know it was 15 minutes because I checked what time I checked in on Yelp (handy little app).  Also, a table that sat after us had already been brought their drinks.  I went over to the hostess stand where a manager was actually standing and asked him if the waiter knew we had been seated.  His response was an annoyed, \"Yeah, we're getting ready to send someone over there.\"  You're getting ready?  For 15 minutes?  So finally our waiter, Ronnie, saunters over to the table and takes our drink orders.  Then he shuffles away.  The drinks come....and he forgot my friend's Shirley Temple.  We'd like to tell him but he ran away as soon as he dropped them off even though we were ready to order by then.  We finally order when we flag him down and remind Ronnie about the Shirley Temple.  And we wait........then we ask the hostess to go get the drink because, what do you know, Ronnie forgot it again.  Now, I don't want you to think I'm being a bitch and this was just a fluke service accident.  So I offer you this other evidence: the couple sitting behind us pulled a manager over because they were having the same issue.  In fact, they set a freaking timer on their phone to prove how long they had waited.  And then there was a third table beside us who complained about a missing beer and had the manager come over.  Hmmmmmmmmm, if three tables in the same section are having issues with the waiter and the amount of time it is taking to even acknowledge customers....don't you think they'd call in more people?  The horrible service left us in a bad mood as we left early at the half.  We would have stayed to watch the whole game and ordered more drinks and food, but, sadly, Ronnie was no where to be found.  So we left and took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"After getting off a late shift the only thing I want to do is enjoy a couple ice cold beers with my friend. It's really hard to enjoy the drinks when I show up at 11. I guess the hours of operation should warn customers to avoid coming in after ten as to not inconvenience the employees.. We were rushed out after our second beer. And although we could have drank more and gave a great tip to show our Appreciation, the server wanted to leave apperently and wanted no part of our business. Not recommended as a place to relax."}
{"text":"Why does this place only have 3 stars? ! I don't know what people expect bit the service is good and the wings come out hot.  Not to mention they are big wings.  Got the large order of wings and you can choose 4 flavors. The Thai curry is for the adventurous but don't attempt if you don't like curry flavors.   Nachos are huge for $10 but could use a little help (the canned ground beef isn't the greatest and you can tell the peppers have been sitting since they are dried out)    Great place to watch the game!"}
{"text":"Finishing the drive from Baltimore, got take out here on the way to family's home in the Pittsburgh area.    No surprises here for this wings chain.  Menu is large and accommodates a range of tastes and levels of health consciousness.  We tried fried pickles, naked chicken tenders, black and blue burger, and chicken wrap with mango habanero (spicy as advertised) sauce.  All solid offerings, good size portions, great value (although maybe we felt this way because Pittsburgh is cheaper than Baltimore in general).  This place did the job for quick take-out but not sure we'd try it for anything else."}
{"text":"My food was delivered and it was fantastic, as always! Something I really love about BW3s is the consistency I can expect regardless of which location I visit or even if my food is delivered."}
{"text":"Well was worried cuz so many bad reviews. Came in today Tuesday. They got half off traditional wings.  Really good price. Wings were not exceptional but very good. We got lucky with server. I think.  Doris(she is the server trainer) waited on us. Man she is good. No wonder she is a trainer. Loll. I will be back as long as servers are like Doris. Little scared to come back thinking I might get a bad service. Lollll"}
{"text":"The service is always poor and the servants like talking to a person but not checking other customers."}
{"text":"Updating review.  Reducing from 4 stars to 3..  Prices have gone up, promos have gotten worse.  Beers are pricey, rarely on sale it seems, and the happy hour appetizer pricing has disappeared?"}
{"text":"Typical chain restaurant. Don't go there that often. Their wings are very good, that's they're known for, so they ought to be. They have several flavors of wings. They have typical bar food, alcohol and Coke!! Lots of TVs with different games on; trivia game and Texas Hold'em poker."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's the fact that we went here twice in one week (once Tuesday and once Thursday) but after like 10 wings or so they all taste the same. Meh...I still love that burning sensation around the mouth when I finish all 12 of the BLAZIN wings and then get to chug them down with BEER!!!   this place gets a 4 for atmosphere, nice staff, good deals on certain nights, and fun entertainment type stuff."}
{"text":"Worse costumer service I ever had, my pick was spouse to ready by 6:30 after 15 mins of waiting. I asked for a manager, she said \"would you like me to cancel your order\". Wow"}
{"text":"Love Buffalo Wild Wings but the service can be better. I went in with my boyfriend to watch a NBA finals game, got there mid 2nd quarter and we wanted to catch the second half as well. So we started with our appetizer and told the waitress that we will order later on, she even asked if we were going to watch the game, which we responded yes. So she comes back during halftime and asks if we are ready to order, I say not yet, in a bit. So right before the game comes back on she brings the check... My boyfriend and I were a bit confused.. Like she knew we were going to order but she brought the check anyways. I was like \"wow they are kicking us out\" lol. So the check is sitting in the table and I kid you not, she came by to check if it was ready for her to take twice. Finally I was like ok let's just go, we paid for our appetizer and drinks and left. Good thing the game was a blow out, we were both upset that she knew we were staying but basically made us get out."}
{"text":"The wait was ridiculous. Went in at 8 left at ten. Seriously understaffed due to call outs? I would of rated it at a one star but the nachos where super delicious. And the tablet also saved them because my daughter was running out of patience. Bottom line is get better staff!! Going to a different location next time..."}
{"text":"It's Buffalo Wild Wings, what can I say.  Good wings, big bar, many TVs.  Service was good, beer was cold, and food came out in a timely manner.  We used to live in Surprise and were happy to see this franchise come closer to Phoenix.  Good place to catch a game or a UFC fight."}
{"text":"My buddies and I know came here on a Sunday because we were going to hold our annual draft here. One of my friends had reserved this place maybe a month ago so I was really excited about that since there was no hassle. We got there maybe 15 minutes early before our reserve time and they were able to take care of us. Our table was near the entrance. It was enough for at least two draft parties.    The waitress we got was really good. She was patient and very professional because sometimes a party of 15 I assume can be overwhelming because of different orders and special requests, but all in all she was excellent. I'd so the only down side was a miscommunication when it came to the check because there was an item on there that I feel we didn't order. I think one of my buddies took care of it and we moved on. Speaking of the food, I'm not really a big fan of most of their items, but I did think in my opinion the mango habenero is really good, just a little spicy. The other item was a dessert item called cinnamon squares and those were just something you had to get another order of.   Overall, that day we went I thought everything I had planned went very smoothly. So, for us reserving the place at Buffalo Wild Wings for our draft party they provided us with some goodies. They provided us with a draft chart and stickers of the players name so we can put together ourselves. There was a championship flag, coupons to share within the group, coasters with our draft numbers, and also bottle openers. I thought that was cool with all the items, but slightly prefer last years because they provided us with a beer can holder and everyone in our draft got a $10 gift card. Hopefully, they can change that back, but all in all it was a pleasant experience for a draft and we'll definitely make sure we hold our draft party here again!!"}
{"text":"Full store review: HORRIBLE. Start off, the location sucks. There are maybe 20 parking spots that aren't U-haul or the gas station nearby. We ended up parking in the field on the opposite site of u-haul.  Next, we were at another location and they had a real long wait. We called ahead to this one and they said there we absolutely no wait. We tried to put our name on the RSVP, but they said that they don't do that over the phone. (I will give them that one) When we actually do walk in, they tell us it is a 35 minute wait. We tell them that we have 4 adults and three kids, so she then asks if we want to sit at the bar if everyone is over 21. Talk about a moron, with me holding my child IN MY ARMS. Didn't think they offered babysitting services either. When they do seat us, they take us to a booth that cannot have a high chair at the table. The hostess, who probably should have kept her McDonalds job, was told that we needed a high chair prior to us being brought to that table. It took a while, but they found another place for us. Hostess service- overall fail. Next, our server was a complete mess. It took over 5 minutes for the kids drinks to arrive at the table, and another 5 for the alcohol. When we ordered appetizers, we stated that one person was allergic to tomatoes, and to hold them. I guess she didn't know that pico de gallo had tomatoes.  That took over 10 minutes to replace some Chili con queso. The same person who asked for no tomatoes asked for a wrap with, spoiler alert, no tomatoes. Yet again, and another 5 minutes went by. Granted, the main food was after waiting for 45 minutes for the food to come out and watching other tables around us sit down AND get their food before us. The waitress had to be asked multiple times for items that would normally be expected or even parts of our meal, dips and such. Food server/cook- FAIL. Last, in order to take a piss, I had to make sure to not stick my feet in the GIANTS puddle of pee on the bathroom floor. Granted, I get that this can happen fast if someone just comes and pissed on the floor, but I came in at the beginning of the meal and after. Most places have an hourly, at the least, check of the bathrooms. Didn't see a manager at all either come to the table and check on anyone in our section. Coming from someone who actually has waited tables before, THIS PLACE SUCKED!!! It was an overall horribly ran restaurant, and honestly, the whole chain has been bad. The last 4 times we have been here, ranging from New Mexico, Texas, and the durango location, BDubs is no longer the place to go. Take a trip down the road and hit up Wing Stop. They have better service and great wings."}
{"text":"1) waited 45 min for 2 beers 2) waited 2.5 hours for a sandwich and salad - then waited another 5 min for silverware  3) couldn't see a Cavs playoff game due to softball, wresting, golf and bdubs trivia taking up tvs 4) when food finally came out, ALL orders were incorrect 5) after all of that that there was no offer for compensation -  I had to tell the waitress we weren't paying  If it were possible to give 0 stars, I would. please do yourself a favor and support the cavs elsewhere, because Bdubs does not value the game or proper service during one."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and sat at the bar. We were greeted almost immediately. Our bartender was fantastic and on top of it all night, never went more than 3 minutes without a drink. He was very friendly and seemed to genuinely care if we were having a good time (he asked a couple times). We ordered wings which came correct, hot, and very good.    It is over priced, but its B-Dubs so of course it is.  Averages about $1 a wing.   Service was 5 stars.  Draught Beer was delicious and obviously correctly cleaned and stored (unlike 98% of bars/restaurants/casinos out here).  Also a huge selection to choose from.   Restaurant was clean.  Would recommend!   ( -1 Star for prices)"}
{"text":"My food was wrong the wait staff couldn't be bothered blah food  boneless wings too breaded"}
{"text":"Well, first off my whole time being here I wondered why the waitress didn't smile, seemed care free about whether or not we had great service. Until I saw the bill and realized you guys charge 18% for a tip without allowing the customer to make that decision. Honestly, I don't care about that, I tip regardless but that explains why she was so care free. You guys should really think about that because that's probably why she treated us like that. She wasn't exactly rude, but she wasn't caring enough to treat us like we're paying her salary. I won't write her name as I don't care to get her in trouble over this as I think it's your companies fault. But just something I think you all need to work on and think about. Servers make their money on tips, they try to get tips by great customer service so when you pre authorize tips without letting us customers know they then turn into ass holes and come to work just to work, not make your customers happy. That makes me never want to come back to Buffalo Wild Wings again just knowing that. Also, I'm a general manager at a pizza shop, so it's not like I'm just some no body who knows nothing about running a business. I turned our lowest sales volume store into an up and coming one in the business, our owner even praises me on how much we're growing. Take this advice, and pass it on. I like seeing other companies thrive and I believe in critique."}
{"text":"It's Buffalo Wild Wings, not much to write about here. The place is okay. Wings and tenders are okay. Today I got a grilled chicken Caesar salad and it wasn't good. The lettuce was brownish and looking like it was past it's prime! The chicken that was in the salad was like frozen breast that was microwaved and just tossed on top!  I should know better than to try and eat something fresh like salad here. Stick to the fried food and soft drinks. You'll walk out feeling like crap but at least you'll be full. LoL Place was pretty clean and the service was good. Probably be back but it won't be for anything other than fried food."}
{"text":"I personally love Buffalo Wild Wings. Have been going to the one in San Diego for years. This is by far the worst Buffalo Wild Wings I've ever been to. The wings had no sauce even though I asked for medium. Had to ask the waitress 3 times for ranch even though it was ordered with the food. Watched the waitress playing with and showing off her tattoo in between 2 out of the 3 times I had asked. Terrible service, the waitress had a terrible attitude."}
{"text":"Worst wings ever. I ordered boneless wings and a beer. The sauce on the wings was  applied unevenly. The wings themselves were horribly hard, dried out little nuggets that were completely unappetizing. The beer was flat and it wasn't even a full pour which appeared to be because the beer was warm and flat. Like other viewers I experienced awful after effects from the food which must be due to poor hygiene in the kitchen - I can only imagine. BWW will not be getting return business from me."}
{"text":"Well, I didn't think that it would be easy to mess up the staples at Buffalo Wild Wings, but I was wrong.  The appetizer of buffalo tots was ok (nothing wrong with it), but both the naked chicken strips and the popcorn shrimp were pretty bad. In fact, the shrimp tasted like dirt so I did not finish it.  In addition, the server never came by to refill our drinks, and the salad was wilted and half dead. Nothing was absolutely horrible, but it is definitely not a place I'd visit again."}
{"text":"The wings are average here.  Even for BWW standards.  Breading is a little heavy and sauce is somewhat inconsistent.  We got salads to go once and the nice thing is they separate the sauces so it's not completely soaked/soggy when you get home to eat it."}
{"text":"The wings and fries are great. I love The atmosphere and being able to watch all the games while eating. The service lacks when it comes to drinks and refills."}
{"text":"Another American restaurant makes its way to Canada.   This is my favourite spot for some basic, traditional wing flavours. Goodbye Crabby Joes, you will be missed.  When the place first open they had ipads that you could use to order the items you wanted if you couldn't get hold of a server right away. That idea tanked, b/c I've returned a couple of times already and see no ipads to be found. I betcha the staff lucked out and got an ipad for free.  The wings here are very flavourful and simple. They remind me of chips b/c one you have one you can't stop. I will say however the wings are very small and when I mean small, I mean I've ate 50 wings, twice, during my visits here. The sad part is I was still hungry after those 50 wings, I only stopped b/c eating more than 50 wings in one sitting is disgusting.   The service is very good and consistant. Staff are constantly checking up on you and refilling drinks without even asking if you want more, of course alcoholic drinks are the exception on free refills. However the wait time for food sucks, for wings it took about 15-20mins to come out. But I already expected that b/c I've been to so many B-Dubs, Buffalo Wild Wings nickname btw, in the States that the wait time for food is consistently slow. So eat a snack b4 heading into B-Dubs.  Lastly there are alot of screens to watch your favourite team, and for once all the screens are a mix of all kinds of games not like most sports bars in Canada that only play hockey games on their screens. :-).  If you want wings this is the place to go for something flavourful and traditional. Tuesdays is their wing night where wings are 55 cents each and for all you Maple Leaf fans, if the Leafs are playing you can get 20 wings and 2 beers for $20.  Items to definitely get:  Wing Flavours - asian zing - garlic parmesan - buffalo - mango habenero - Sweet BBQ"}
{"text":"LOVE, there mango habanero!  A mix of spicy and sweet.  The wings were pretty big about 4\" for the wing and a little less for the mini leg looking one.  Enjoy my wings with a side of buffalo chips (french fries in a round shape) and some blue cheese.   There hot are pretty tasty too.  Do not like the carabean jerk, those to me are pretty gross, but some of my friends do like them. I saw give it a try.   Also a great place to catch the game or simply play some trivia."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch closer to 1. We opted to sit at the bar as my friend indicated the service was faster - unfortunately wasn't the case. The restaurant was busy, the bar area- not so much. Our server was OK. She seemed nice but had little interest in our table. She wasn't particularly memorable either as I usually remember names and I don't hers.   Food took a long time (about 35 minutes, we ordered 3 snack wings) and my friend asked to have hers re-tossed as the sauce was close to dry when it came out. I also had to chase her down to get our check at the end- which she brought back very quickly, thankfully.   Overall was satisfied enough with our lunch."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2013- 15/100  Don't expect anything fancy. Decent selection of bar food...I'd recommend the wings (of course), especially the honey BBQ or Spicy Garlic. If you're with a group consider ordering  the sampler which includes some delicious fresh chips, soft pretzels, some super spicy wings. Ambiance is decent and there's plenty of seating and TV screens around showing all types of sporting events. They also get bonus points for being  having the entire restaurant Nonsmoking .. (rare in Vegas).  They also serve my favorite 'beerish' drink...Pear Cider. Yes, I'm a weenie and I enjoy cider.  Also, they offer 60 cent per wing ( boneless or bone-in) on Tuesdays.. Go get your grub on..."}
{"text":"Honestly I've never felt so disrespected. The grave staff is horrible rude and racist. They should learn their laws management is horrible as well. I've been going to the same location for a long time and unfortunately this time the grave didn't match the great staff they have during the day."}
{"text":"Came here today with my wife, daughter and friend. started with fried mushroom. not bad exept they brought no ranch. we asked for it but it took forever. the wraps sucked. the buffalo chicken wrap was way to spicy for them to it. ot was supposed to have ranch inside it to cool it off. the pepper jack steal wrap has this god awfult dressing inside it. the mac and cheese came out half frozen! I keep coming back and every time wonder why. other than the beer and tv's this food sucks."}
{"text":"Very busy tonight! Had a little problem with hostess and manager but got it all figured out.  Turns out we got our favorite waitress Nicole. She's the bomb."}
{"text":"Worst service ever do not go here!!!  Wings were awful it took forever for us to be seated  Beer was stale"}
{"text":"I would never go here again though they have a vast amount of different flavored wings as I tried 5 different flavors none were too appetizing if you happen to find yourself check out the salt n pepper wings they were different I've never seen that flavor before as a wing contra sore"}
{"text":"They got rid of the half price traditional wings Tuesday.  Now no discount on traditional wings at all.  Tiny wings at a large price.  Will go elsewhere now..."}
{"text":"Its a fine place.  If you think the Olive Garden is the best Italian than you'll think this place is the best for wings. Or, if you take comfort in the familiarity of chain restaurants than again its for you. But if you're actually looking for the best wings for the best cost try a local place like Chicken Shack or Born and Raised. If you're looking for beer again Go Local or a national chain that has a good happy hour prices and more to offer on tap. Finally for a sports place that tries to establish itself in the community they go out of their way to not show UNLV basketball again try local, especially a great place like born and raised... if you don't mind a little drive."}
{"text":"Dont waist your time!  We got here at 6:30 on sat night for a friends birthday. When we sat down we ordered a beer each and everyone wanted to do a shot so we all did one. We at that point we ordered chips and queso dip. 45 min later we ask about the queso and the waitress said she will check on it. She comes back out the kitchen and says they are making it now. WTF this is chips from a bag and some cheese dip the put in a microwave. Unreal. 10 min later our chips and queso show up. Everytime we ordered a beer it took 15-20 min to get. No joke. Its because they have one person bartending on a saturday night. Not sure why, but the place was only about a third full but she was backed up and the manager was not helping. At about 8:30 a few more people show up and we got another shot and now my third beer in two hours. When the waitress brings the drinks she tells us the manager says we cant order anymore drinks for 30 45 min. I said why not. She says the manager says we cant serve you anymore shots cause there is a limit to how much we can serve you in a certain amount of time. I said you have got to be kiddding me. On my third beer and two little girl foo foo shots and we are cut off, one hour for queso dip , you are f$#kin kidding me. I said check please we are out of here. We were not being loud or causing in attention to us for any reason. It was the most melow I have seen a grpup of 10 be at a bar. A few people went outside to smoke every once in a while and each end of the table had there own conversation going on.The worst service, I have never seen this before. I have been drinkin at the bars for a while and I have to say 3 12oz bottel beers and 2 shots in 2 and a half hours on a sat night is a slow start at the bar. This place is horrible. If I could give them 0 stars or negative stars I would! Im sorry I guess Im the only one going to the bar on a sat night to get a littel drunk."}
{"text":"Wings....Meh....beer list....Meh....No more free WiFi....server nice and helpful....that is all I have to say..... Won't be back"}
{"text":"I am between 3.5 to 4 stars but the service was great so I bumped the review up.  I like the shrimp and the boneless wings, great selection of sauces. I ate lunch there with some friends and they said their salad and sandwich were average, but nothing to write home about (they did eat all their food)   If your there to watch sports, you will love it. If your there to talk shop or do a little business it was a little noisy and there are TV's everywhere distracting you.  Bottom line, Good sports bar and fun place, not the best place to do business.  I will be back for shrimp and boneless wings and to enjoy a cold one with the game"}
{"text":"Friday night and this place is packed for football week one! ! We gave the baked wings which is best so you can pick up to four sauces... and we chose sweet bbq,  honey bbq,  Asian zing, thai curry to start. Of course it still goes well with carrots and celery. The Asian zing is tangy and spicy, while the Thai curry is hotter but has a perfect kick in the mouth.. stay tuned.. as I'm still eating. ."}
{"text":"Haven't been dissaponted with their wing flavors and service yet! If you order the plain, you can order a variety of sauce on the side and that way it feels like you have a variety at your disposal."}
{"text":"Lol. What a poor excuse of a BDUBS. It's my favorite place to eat and this place is a joke. No leadership, poor wait staff, they put the drink tickets IN THEIR DRINKS which is insane unless you like ink in your beer AND now they close early for no reason. What a joke."}
{"text":"I drove 20 minutes from Pineville to get to this location last night and arrived at 1232 and the place closes at 1. I was looking to sit down and have a beer while I placed a TO GO order for Wing Tuesday. Upon arrival there was no one in the restaurant to be seen so I sat at the bar and waited. I looked at the clock and saw it was now 12:40 and I decided to get up and start looking for some sign of life so I went to the to go area and saw all of the employees huddled up in the back of house on their phones laughing so I asked if I could have a beer and place a to go order and the manager said no. I asked why and he said they stop serving alcohol at 1230 every night and it was company policy. I had explained how I had just got off work and drove 20 minutes to get to that location and he Said there's nothing that could be done. I'm a Buffalo Wild Wings rewards member and it is my favorite place to eat but I will not be visiting this location again. What a waste of time."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for close to two years now and have never had a problem.   I usually go Tuesdays for the traditional wing specials because boneless wings don't have a soul.  Great bartenders and servers on swing shift and a great place to catch a game. The bartenders are more than willing to accommodate the crowd on what gets shown on the screens, and don't mind when I start frothing at the mouth every time a Laker player turns the ball over.  The food is excellent, I always order a dozen hot and a basket of wedges (the wedges are some of the best I've tried anywhere). I can't testify to their other flavors because I'm a wing-purist and believes they should only be eaten hot."}
{"text":"OMG coming out of wild wing and our server is being arrested. Shouldn't have left the tip. Lmao"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings food is always consistent which is why we went in. The food was average like every other location in the country but the crowd here was as trashy as I've ever experienced.   This is my first time in Mentor, I've been to Cleveland where I know they've had better times but I'm wondering if this is how life has always been in Mentor... lots of drunk people.  We sat at the bar, ordered our food and while waiting for our drinks two very drunk people got into a bar fight tipped their chairs over and smashed my arm. My husband and I got up and told the bar tender we'd like to move to the restaurant side to distance ourselves from these people and she rolled her eyes. The server whose section we sat in once we found a table open away from the bar seemed annoyed with where we sat but we explained we had already ordered food so she just shrugged her shoulders and let us stay.  The rest of our dining experience was filled with eye rolls. Maybe we're out of town snobs but where we come from and most other places I've traveled to if there's an individual at a bar so drunk they're tackling people and falling over in chairs they're kicked out and the people they hit get checked on to make sure they're ok. My arm is still aching from that obese person falling on me and I'm happy I'll never be back in Mentor."}
{"text":"Party of 5 went in for lunch on a Saturday.  Waitress was friendly (at first).  Took longer then expected to receive one wrap, one mac & cheese with bbq wings and three burgers.  My husband's burger was plain - had lettuce & tomatoes but no condiments - when he asked the waitress about it... she said; there is ketchup on the table what else do you want?   I'm like REALLY???   The blue cheese burgers were ok but nothing to write home about.  My mac & cheese was warm - I would never have known the boneless wings included in the meal with bbq.  BORING.....  The wrap was ok.  Three men - each with burger & fries and still hungry when we left.    After my husband asked the waitress why she didn't ask him about mayo, mustard or ketchup she became \"invisible\" to us... no more ice tea refills - no more service.  I think his two questions stared her off.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"They have since gotten rid if cheese curds due to it being a special, last couple of times we have been we have had HORRIBLE service forgotten food, cold, & not what we ordered. It's sad because we do love b dubs , it's just gone down hill"}
{"text":"After our visit to the NASCAR Hall of Fame, we figured we'd grab a quick lunch before heading out on our road trip.   Buffalo Wild Wings was conveniently located...  The food, however, absolutely sucks.   We ordered 6 chicken boneless wings which were dry and not all that appetizing.   We also got 3 mini pork sliders and they too were dry and unimaginative.  Go somewhere else if you even remotely want decent food.   Lola's across the street is a vast improvement over Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Much like many of the other BWW's It Is spacious enough, yummy eats and a FANTASTIC HAPPY HOUR. so please do make a pit-stop here on your way to the mall :)"}
{"text":"BWW Is awesome!!!! Especially on fight nights!!! I love coming here for some of they're new Southwest Bites and beer to watch some of my fave UFC Fighters on live circuit."}
{"text":"Seriously.  Is this place for real. Great interior but that's it.   Lousy service and bad bar food.   Wow. Never coming back.  Pathetic. Poor management.  It took 5 minutes to get vinegar for the salt and vinegar wings.   They forgot the vinegar and then the manager brought the vinegar after 5 minutes of my wings getting cold."}
{"text":"Somewhat busy on saturday. Food came out cold. Shaylene the waitress was not interested in helping us at all. Has been the worst service we have recieved in a very long time. This olace has really regressed over the years. Son had wings that were literally saturated with sauce. Would bot ever come back again."}
{"text":"Good food, lackluster service. If you're with little ones, definitely skip it. The food took hour + and it was a struggle for our waitress to keep up with our simple requests."}
{"text":"Bar food and that's about it...on the positive note happy hour is good and so is the selection of beers."}
{"text":"It is a normal BW3; great place to go when you are alone. The food is consistent but a little pricey for the quality and quantity. Bartender here was attentive and friendly; talked to all of Twitter customers. They changed the channel without argument which is appreciated. Food was good and came out quickly. Overall a better than average Buffalo Wild Wings location."}
{"text":"Love the bar. They have grate service  Wings come fresh and delicious  Will keep coming here"}
{"text":"We come here once a year in hopes that the service has gotten better but it is worse than horrible!!!! We waited 30 minutes for plain wings and when we asked another server about it (because ours was no where around)she was snooty booty!!! The food has never been stellar and that's to be expected however you do want a little service at least refills and silverware! Apparently that's too much to ask at this dirty establishment!!! Our annual tradition of giving this restaurant a shot is over!!!! Here's your warning don't come here unless you intend to be here for over an hour paying to be treated like they are doing you a favor being here!"}
{"text":"Visited this location on July 17, 2014 at about 6pm.  This day happened to be boneless wings for 60 cents day, so they were somewhat busy.  Checked in with the hostess and only waited about 5 min for a table.   I ordered 15 boneless wings with mild classic wing sauce.  My daughter had the build your own sandwich, which she chose the chicken sandwich with lettuce, pickle spear, and bacon.  Sandwich comes with fries.  We also started with some cheese sticks because it was still happy hour, so why not.  Cheese sticks came out pretty quick and tasted delicious.  About 10 min later our food arrived.  My daughters sandwich had Swiss cheese on it, which she didn't order, but she still ate it anyway.  My boneless wings looked like breaded chicken pieces literally DROWNING in wing sauce.  I was only able to get through about 6-7 of them before I had to stop.  Not only was it not mild flavored, but I felt like I was just eating liquid hot wing sauce.  The waitress (Samantha) was very nice to offer me something else, which I declined, and took it off our bill.  My daughter was very happy with her meal...cheese and all.  Samantha our server checked on us often, refilled our drinks as needed, and was very nice.  You could tell she had been serving for quite a while and knew what she was doing.    In closing, with the exception of my food being messed up due to the kitchen, this was a good experience.  Honestly never really had any real bad issues with this restaurant and the wings are always great.    I give this dining experience 4 out of 5 stars with the only problem being the drowning wings.  Other than that, service was great.  Best of luck to Samantha in law school, which she leaves for in 2 weeks (as she told us through our conversation).  If you make it in there before her two weeks are up, I would request her if you can.  Always good to have a helpful server!!"}
{"text":"Not dog friendly.   Upon special request to be seated on the patio to accomodate our friend's leashed dog (Hiro), we were led out by the front wait staff.  However, upon being seated, we were informed that Hiro would need to be stationed on the other side of the fence. The staff additionally had no way for us to move Hiro to the other side, recommending that we jump over the fence and jump back over.  The lack of shade in the Arizona weather was unfit for leaving the dog outside.  Before we were served our waters, we decided to take our business elsewhere.  Note: this review does not take into account the service or food at this particular BWW."}
{"text":"Cold fries, cold nachos and an indifferent staff makes for a truly unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"The wings are great but sometimes the service is less the spectacular. On our last visit we were seated promptly but that's where the great service ended. It took about 5 minutes just to get water and about another 15 for straws. The staff looked like they were cleaning but it never appeared to get clean. So after we ordered the wings took longer than usual and another waitress brought them out (which is not a problem) but our server looked confused that we had food. That was also the last time we saw her. Never got refills and had to flag down someone after finishing and waiting for 15 minutes with empty baskets and drinks. Bdubs you have to step it up, you can't hope your wings make people forget lousy service!"}
{"text":"What can I not say about BWW? I LOVE this place. We are usually here at least once a week. Tuesday 45 cent wings are never a let down. We usually end up getting the Mango Habanero and Caribbean Jerk sauced wings. The pulled pork sliders (with Hot BBQ sauce) and cheeseburger sliders are perfect. They'll even add a little bacon to the cheeseburger sliders if you ask. The potato wedges are always hot and great. You can add cheese and/or bacon on top but I find them the tastiest when they are plain. I love their Chicken Tender salad which is simply lettuce, tomato, red onion, croutons and your choice of chicken tenders drenched in the sauce of your choice. This salad usually provides me leftovers that I have for lunch the next day.  The service is always great. Awesome music is always playing. You can play a little video poker/blackjack up at the bar if you'd like.   I'd live at BWW if I could. Seriously."}
{"text":"TWICE we have had horrible service.  Both times my orders were wrong. We could never find our servers and our food was cold. You would think I'm a glutton for punishment seeing how we went back but I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt. No NOPE Not again. We love westgate but this place just has THE crappiest service.  Also on both visits the place wasn't even busy so that's not an excuse. Don't waste your time or money here folks. There's better places to eat."}
{"text":"Ok I've read the reviews and there are not a lot of favorable ones.  But I have to tell you...my husband and I go to this BWW every tuesday.    First off, one day, I decided to order a side garden salad instead of fries....OMG... Now we always order a side garden salad because it is the BEST, crispest, freshest salad I think I've ever gotten in a restaurant ... and it's consistently good!  Never thought I'd find that in a BWW!! Give it a shot!  The wings are always amazing as wings usually are and we always order with the honey bbq sauce.  Add a Kiltlifter.....YUM.  I have to tell you... I think the staff in incredible.  They have always been friendly, accommodating and responsive.  Maybe we've just been lucky, but you'd think going as often as we have we would have run into a bad experience once or twice.  This just hasnt been the case!"}
{"text":"AWFUL. Do not go here. Hours are not accurate. Terrible service. I would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"I wish I could give less than one star.  From the service to the food it was disappointing. My food was too spicy for me to eat and although it was removed fron the bill I was not offered anything else.  I watched my family eat and left hungry without lunch.  The manager was not called and our waiter was clueless.  We were here to celebrate the last day of school and instead I am still hungry."}
{"text":"Traditionally I've never been a fan of BWW until the last few months after stumbling onto this location.  These guys are great!!!....this BWW has the new \"stadium\" seating concept. Compared to older builds it's hands down the best BWW I've been to as there are so many excellent quality TV's... there is never a bad seat in the house come game day!!!  Staff is excellent in my opinion, courteous and professional....always very friendly and service oriented. Management is approachable, goes out of their way to make me feel welcome and leads with an ownership mentality.  I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"It was a 3 strikes and you're out experience. I ordered a Caesar chicken salad. A large percentage of the lettuce was brown or slimy as if the kitchen staff didn't even look at it before sending it out...strike1. The manager checked and reported that they did in fact have fresh lettuce and they would quickly make a new salad. I sat for twenty minutes with an empty glass hoping someone would ask if I'd like another beer while the other 3 people at my table finished their food...strike2. I cancelled my meal. Did they comp us anything to make us feel a little better about the experience ...nope...strike 3. I pride myself in only sharing my good experiences but I just couldn't let this one slide!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best bdubbs in Vegas. Always get fresh food and a smile here. Every person in here does there part and they don't have attitude when you come in before close. Which is always a plus  Raven is the best waitress she always remembers us and has a genuine personality, you can tell she actually enjoys her job. Great place"}
{"text":"I came in just to get a gift cards. I waited in what seemed to be a takeout line. The girl was texting on her phone and not paying attention to me, who hadn't been helped. The people standing near the counter were waiting on their takeout orders. I heard one complain that she was 15 minutes over her quoted time. Not a good experience!"}
{"text":"Huge B Dubs fan for over 10 years but the quality of the places have gone down. It is still a good place to grab beers and watch the game. I wont take that away from them. The wings were actually big but they don't put enough sauce on them at all. Service by Amanda was interesting. She approached our table explaining how she is hung over and went skinny dipping last night. Then ranted about how she is a Buddhist and Namaste this and that."}
{"text":"Service is spotty - love BWs but this location has had a long stretch of bad service and lack of care when it come to servicing customers. My son loves this place but I have been served cold food on several occasions - take out is just as bad ALWAYS check your food before you leave. Notorious for leaving out condiments or parts of orders."}
{"text":"I love this place. Usually order boneless, mild buffalo wings. Mild is enough for me, spicy enough that is!  Love the wings, even my baby loved his sauceless wings! The chocolate cake was also good, not as sweet as in most places - a plus for me  The only downside is the time it takes to get the food - maybe it's just because they make them \"fresh\" but I always go there super hungry and feels like they take an eternity to bring the food"}
{"text":"Past 5 visits were terrible.   Slow food to table service.   Friendly staff but mediocre food quality.   The waiting is the worst.   Not everyone wants to be there 2 hrs"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened since the 2009 reviews but this place is Ghetto.  Worst Service in the world.  I know numerous people who will never go there again.  They drive further away to other BWW to eat.  Agai, it's not the food, it's the lack of service.  So sad."}
{"text":"last week had 3 different servers take my beer order....got beer 15 min later then never saw another server in next 45 min. complained. nothing happened and charged me for beer.  Good Management....not"}
{"text":"No stars isn't an option apparently. Terrible quality food for the price. The waitress was a joke, never to be found when I needed something. Didn't give me her name. Didn't seem like she gave a damn about working there. My last time at this establishment."}
{"text":"Came for beers...beers were fine.  Bartender was nice and wanted to chat with us but it was hard to hear him with the strong bass of the TV sound.  Female bartender needs to bite the bullet and buy a bigger size in jersey and leggings.  It was odd to see bartenders eating off of a tray on the side of the bar...is it their food?  Is it food headed to a table? Either way...I shouldn't see them eat.  Clean place, will be packed for sports games with the billion TVs and well known name, but, meh for me."}
{"text":"Usually a pretty solid bet - both food and drink are predictable, good, but predictable. Love their wings though, definitely have their specialty down pat. If you're in the mood for fried food (you name it, it's fried here) and a cold beer, come on down!"}
{"text":"Typical BW3's. Noisy, typical sports bar atmosphere. 40 year old guys with baseball caps on backwards, shades hanging off the back of their Vikings jerseys, yelling at the jerk who just dropped an easy pass because, you know, if he was playing he could have done much better... bah good wings (get them extra crispy) service was good. I've never really had slow service at the bar area, the sit down area though i think is quite a bit slower. Our waitress was nice and talked with us for a bit. I've always like the BW3's in Centennial Hills better though, not sure why...."}
{"text":"Misty was amazing. I went there with all three of my kids and I'm always in a rush with them. Misty made sure that the food came out fresh and quick. She even brought us extra napkins without new having to ask. checked up on us regularly not once did I have to flag her down for anything. I will definitely be back but only if she's my server."}
{"text":"We sat for 10 mins in the bar booths... No one came... So we moved to the dining room .  There we sat for almost 20 mins and still no one approached us. We watched 3 tables sat after us get greeted.   Servers were standing around chit-chatting.  The manager was busing tables instead of greeting.  When there was plenty open tables.  We visit often sometimes just 1 but up to 12 of us.  I even asked to be helped.  Still no one.  We left and more than likely not return.  This caused the loss of loyal customers."}
{"text":"Day after Christmas so everywhere was crazy busy.  As I asked for the wait time, your hostess was super annoyed with the high stress environment, and stated if we want to \"check out\" the bar area for a high top table we could just walk in, but the wait was \"a long time\". I asked about sitting outside, she stated, let me check to see if we have a server willing to work outside.  (Two tables were already situated outside.) She put our name on the list for dining area to be safe.  25 minutes go by, and I went inside to \"check\" if we could be seated outside. She then openly asks a server who is at the drink station or counter nearby if he can \"handle\" a party of 6. He looks at her frustrated and says, \"I already have 3 tables, but whatever!\".  She then looks at me and says, \"you can sit outside if you want he will take you.\"  \"UHHHHH....NO? After seeing the way he was with even getting more patrons, do you think I want to sit in his area?\"   At this point, people in the waiting area see this, and LEAVE. I mentioned to her how it's probably not a great idea to openly ask your team if they can \"handle\" anything.   I just tell her we will look for a table top in the bar.  Found a table, the manager who looks tired as all get out, takes our drink orders.  The waitress who had us was pleasant but overwhelmed clearly.  Drinks took 20 minutes and food was almost 45 minutes to receive. Most of anyone who was working were agitated and overwhelmed. You hostess was clearly inexperienced, she was a very young lady who even said a couple of times out loud, \"I'm about to have a break down\". Why is this individual even in the front? She is your restaurant's liaison for new and returning patrons.  It just makes for a bad dynamic for the customer. Having worked in this industry, I am understanding to how busy it can get.  To include your server who was in front of customers complaining of how he had enough \"tables\".  Watch who you hire! Some may be good for the hustle but not for customer service!   Service was not so great! We would of left with other people but my kids seriously wanted BWW regardless! Probably won't ever come here again! Food was alright, fries were not that warm and the sauce on the wings were over the top!  Plenty of other options next time!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  We sat down and the hostess told us that our server was new and kind of winked at me.  I prolly should've taken this as a warning but I sat down with my 3 kids (ages 8,6, and 5).  After we ordered our food I couldn't find our server anywhere.  35 minutes went by and finally the manager saw my upset look and came over.  He told me he would check on it and let me know.  He said my kids chicken tenders is what were taking so long.  Not sure what took nearly 40 minutes to make tenders but finally the food came.  Our other food had clearly been sitting out for at least a half hour because my daughters wings were so hard she couldn't even eat them.  My quesadilla was soggy all the way through from sitting out while we waited for the food.  The server apologized and said the tenders were on them since they took so long.  At this point i didn't even care but appreciated the gesture.  She then came back with the Check and the tenders were on there . I asked her and she gave me a dirty look and then walked away.  If it wasn't already getting close to my kids bedtime I would have asked for the maneger or owner but I just decided no tip would be enough.  I've worked in restaraunts before and currently work in a high luxury customer environment and service is crucial these days.  Both her service and the manager here were deplorable.   I know the chicken tenders didn't take 40 minutes to cook.  You drop them in a fryer and at max 8 minutes we are done.  I would've rather they just said after 20 minutes hey we forgot about them and here's something in the meantime.  Honesty is best but don't tell me it takes you 40 minutes to fry a kids chicken tenders.  I expect much better from this place"}
{"text":"Came in on Thursday $.60 wing night and the places was packed asses to elbows. They sat us within 5 to 10 mins which was great the service was a bit slow but I understood with as many people that were there. The food was on point and the waiter made sure that everything was satisfactory and he was trying to hustle to keep our drinks filled at all times. I think they might've understaffed for the night but needless to say I will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"This Bdubs finally screwed up my order.   I've been here probably ten times. Having a Buffalo Wild Wings in close proximity is .25% of the reason we bought the house in the area. I like what the business does and they usually do it pretty well. However, as happens when you employ actual people, one of them made an honest mistake and put meat on my wife's nachos. Which we didn't discover until I had returned home.  I called them back and relayed the problem (we have dead animal on this stuff. We specifically asked for no delicious animal murder on these chips) and they offered us free food. We said we didn't want free food we just would like an exchange please. The nachos we recieved looked like the menu. You know how food never looks as good as it does on the menu? These looked like Mario Batali plated our Bdubs nachos. They also *forced* chocolate cake on us. The manager personally apologized. All of this highly unnecessary but very appreciated.  I have come away impressed every time I've eaten here. The beer list is great (this varies from Bdubs to Bdubs) the service is good. The only bad thing is they get full during big UFC events. Completely reasonable.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After the way I was treated & disrespected I will never go back to this Buffalo Wild Wings again or at least until there is a different manager (Robyn) . I'm a waitress myself & I know what it's like when there are mistakes on behalf of the staff. I always try to be understandable anywhere I eat, but the way I was treated by the \"manager on duty\" Robyn was beyond disrespectful & offensive. I ordered online & picked up my order at this specific bww. Once I was home I realized one of my orders was wrong & thought it was a mistake on my behalf, I triple checked my receipt & realized it wasn't my mistake but it was a mistake on behalf of Buffalo Wild Wings. It was 12:30 am just got into town from Colorado & I was pretty upset & decided to call & let them know what had happened. I was very nice about it & let them know what happened, the manager had attitude with me from the beginning. I had three orders of boneless mango habanero & sweet bbq except one of them was extra crispy & traditional. The order of traditional extra crispy wing was given to me with no sauce at all it was completely plain. I let the manager know the order was suppose to have mango habanero & sweet bbq sauce on the wings. She straight up lied to me & said that I asked for the sauce on the side . I told her mam I have the receipt on my hand, it doesn't say that on the receipt & even if that was the case I don't even have the sauces on the side. She decided to blame me for it then after I proved her wrong she blamed it on corporate because of the way they have the site set up. I let her know more than 3 times that it wasn't the sites fault & it wasn't my fault they just got the order wrong & what could she do to fix it. Then she said she needed all my information so she can give me a credit back since she couldn't refund the money. I politely asked for her name 5 times & she kept talking over me at this point you can understand I had enough & I was furious. She finally gave me her name (Robyn) well that's if that really was her name because since the beginning she was being very dishonest. Once she gave me her name I asked her if she was the manager, first she said no then she said yes. I couldn't believe my ears. She said she needed my information to give me credit, I told her I would be calling corporate, never in my life would I ever think of calling corporate but at this point i felt the need too since she said she was the manager & I didn't know who else to speak too. She said I wouldn't hear from them in a while & I told her take my information so I can drop by the next day. She literally said I have all your information in front of me & tried ending the conversation. I said are you serious you just asked me for the information because you said you don't have it . So I decided to end the conversation right there & then she was going to continue to lie & be dishonest & contradict herself. Listen my husband & kids were listening to the whole thing my husband was furious even wanted to take over the conversation because he couldn't believe his ears he really wanted to tell her off. We are very good people I have never complained anywhere I've ate, let alone write a bad review. I had to do it I understand people & staff make mistakes but all i really wanted was a sense of understanding & accountability on her part, see how we could of fixed the issue but instead she lied & tried to blame it on anything she could instead of taking responsibility of a mistake that could of been handled with taste & class. If she really is the manager I can't believe they have someone like that running the place. It's sad & to be completely honest I just feel very hurt that this happened to my kids & I don't recommend this place while it's being ran by her."}
{"text":"We stopped here after getting our nails done and I think it was a wonderful idea!!!!  I was starving!  Our waiter, Steven, was extremely good at his job.  He was very on top of attending to our table and suggesting what to eat.  He also was very friendly and joked with us at the table.  He for sure is one of the main reasons why I am giving this BW3s all THE stars!  So if corporate ever reads this, Steven is a rock star and deserves all the gold stars!!!  For my appetizer I ordered chips and salsa.  And I LOVE me some chips and salsa.  Their salsa had an extra kick to it, which I truly appreciated!  For my main course I ordered the veggie burger without cheese and added the Asian Zing (I forgot the name of it lol).  It was so yummy, very spicy but oh so good!"}
{"text":"So disappointed.. After we finished clubbing, we came back to the hotel and decided to go out for some BWW and unlike how it states that they are open 24/7, THEY ARE NOT. They said they always close from 5-8am because they have no customers? Okay that's totally fine and I understand that, but then maybe you guys can at least put up a sign that states this. We were all excited and were put down real quick."}
{"text":"So I hadn't been to a B-Dubs in years! Literally 5 or more. Anyways I go in and so much has changed! The menu has so much stuff going on but I managed. Our server Brittany was amazing. She was very personable, down to earth and kept it 100 in regards to what her preferences were. These stars are for her. When the food did come which seems like hours later it was ok. I ordered Parmesan Garlic wings and Honey BBQ, which they were out of. Let's pause for a moment...HOW ARE YOU OUT OF HONEY BAR-B-QUE?!?! There goes another star!  So as my stomach is growling, for what seems like a half of eternity, the food finally arrives. I seriously think they killed, plucked and seasoned the chicken the moment I ordered. 10 wings shouldn't take 40 min tires, especially at 12am on a Thursday. All in all great service, slow response time, oh and hopefully they have the flavors you want."}
{"text":"Sometimes the wings are bad, sometimes they're just delicious.  So I don't know what to make of it except to give a mediocre rating.  It's fun sometimes drinking here except on big game days where it's just ridiculously crowded, and service stinks on these days.  The days with the specials are the days to definitely go.  I've just had up and down days from this place."}
{"text":"My experience here always differs every time.  I guess it depends on the cook, but sometimes the chicken wings are just cooked well with a nice crisp to it, or they're just undercooked and soggy.    The appetizers haven't disappointed me.  Onions rings are always cooked to a golden brown, fried mushrooms are great, the sampler always does well, and I can go on with the appetizers, but those are usually just good.  The service can be hit or miss also.  Sometimes I might get a waiter that will never come by for service.  You're just annoyingly waiting for him just for a cup of water.  The other times, like last time, they'll be great to you.  Bringing yourself a pitcher of water without asking, trying their best to get an order right (There was a confusing moment for him when my friends tried to order something specific to go.) which I thought was admirable, and he gave us little things like ranch without any charge.   I guess I've had more times where I enjoyed it than not, but you happen to go on wrong day, it can just be really bad."}
{"text":"The ladies here make this location a home!  Life here without Fernando would be the bane of my BWW experience. It is people that make this bar!"}
{"text":"Wings work out to be one dollar per wing which seems expensive to me. The boneless wings really aren't any better than what McDonald's serves. Beer is expensive as I paid seven dollars for a Guinness draft.  Service was slow.  I had a black and blue burger with fries that was pretty good. However my friends that had the wings have decided not to return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wings are consistent with other locations.  Went for lunch and ordered soup, but they were out.  How do you run out of soup at lunchtime?"}
{"text":"This is seriously the WORST BWW. I've been too many locations and have never had such horrible dining experience. We ordered drinks and food as soon as we sat down since we knew exactly what we wanted. The drinks took 15 minutes to get to our table (take in mind it was only two of us). It's been 45 minutes and still no food. Our server only came by to drop the drinks off. I had to stop a different server to ask about our food and his response was it take 45 minutes to an hour for food. I couldn't believe it . And then he told me the host was suppose to inform me it would take that long. Still have not received my food I just hope the wait is worth it !!! Definitely not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Went in with co workers and the waitress from the start said she was new, ok no worries!! Problem was one of us never got his food! Next I gave her my card to pay 41$ and looked at my bank statement and noticed she charged me extra 10$ where and why? Told the manager why and they said it would be fixed! Nothing yet!! Never going to that place again!! Watch yourself!! Ashley is the waitress!!"}
{"text":"Wings and fries arrived slightly warmer than room temperature. The boneless wings would be considered nuggets at best any where else. They get a bonus point for switching the the TV nearest my seat to the hockey game of my request without any complaint. Unfortunately considering the quality and price of the wings, I could have gotten as much from the Sheetz next door and they would have been served hot."}
{"text":"Love this B-Dubs! Our experiences here have always been great ones. We went there tonight, and Elan was fabulous! Very attentive to our needs and questions. We would have gave 5 stars, however we found out tonight  that they have discontinued the jammin' jalapeno flavored sauce. It was a family favorite. PLEASE bring it back! Thanks! Smiles..."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!!! The hostess was more then rude & spoke to us like we were stupid & the manager was clueless"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location there is always an issue and I usually never leave reviews for places . I ordered over the phone and told him I wanted boneless wings and repeated my self just to insure he heard me correctly ... I get home and open my box to find that they're not boneless . Such a let down. The chicken was so bland and worst of all when I went to get the napkins out of my bag they were bunched together and obviously were used . Like wtf???? So disgusting... I really wish I didn't tip . Complete Waste of money , I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone . Don't even bother especially after midnight."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for fried food same with the portions of food being ok and service is a bit slow for chicken sandwich I ordered 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Love there wings and they really have good cusomer service... makes me feel comfortable coming 2 eat with my family and friends ...."}
{"text":"Andrew is an awesome bartender who does his job well. He professional and funny. I came in and ordered food Togo and waited while playing a little keno at the bar. Enter two douche bags who don't understand when you don't have your ID (or a valid one) you  can't be in establishment that's 21+ up after midnight. The douche bags got super mad about it, even asked for a manager, he got involved, oh what a surprise, same answer.. they said \"your bartenders a dick\".. \"uh no, he's doing his job you rocket scientist..   I made sure the manager knew he wasn't being a dick, but this wasn't his first rodeo, he knew but was appreciative I told him.   Food was good, typical bdubs but Andrew is a super chill bartender, I'll go back when he's working grave"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food, because we didn't get to eat.  I arrived around 6:45 on a Saturday with a party of 6.  There were 3 employees congregating at the hostess stand, not sure what their functions were.  After standing for a good 5-10 minutes, we were seated.  Did I mention that the restaurant was nearly empty?  There were several employees wandering around, but not one approached our table.  We sat for about another 15 minutes before we decided that this place truly did not need our business.  I noticed that there a quite a few negative reviews about this locations.  You would think the management would take note and make improvements to their customer service."}
{"text":"Wing lovers rejoice. This chain has plentiful of wing flavours and the size of wings are very consistently larger than most.   Pricing is expensive for wings (except wing night which is Thursday $0.75).   Staff are super friendly and lots of sitting area in both restaurant and lounge (lots of TVs)  Menu has great selection of food from salads to burgers.   If you enjoy wings this a great place and they have 15 minute or free lunch menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for a huge variety of wing flavours.   Staff are super friendly and quick.   Pricing is little expensive for wings but the size and flavours make up for it.   There are both a dining and lounge area for sports fans which dozens of TVs.   Menu is of course chicken wing based but there are burgers and salads too.   Atmosphere is lively with both music and sports in background noise.   Wing fans rejoice for south Calgary and restaurant is a must try."}
{"text":"Decided to give them one more chance as my wife really wanted one of their wraps. We sat outside as it was really nice today. The server was fast and we were able to be seated very quickly which was a an improvement over other visits in the last year. The resturaunt seemed busy but the server was fast with drinks and taking our order. We put in our order at 12:07. I was optimistic this visit and things were going really well. Then I noticed the floors on the patio.... they were covered in soda/sticky stuff. Looking around I started seeing more this that were disappointing. The amount of birds and nests above eating areas was concerning. The bird droppings on the patio, fencing and exit doors was unacceptable. After putting in our order in it took 32 minutes for our food to come out. The server came around for drink refills only once and it took an additional 10 minutes between the server clearing the dishes for us to get our check. The food was good but it seems that they have changes the sauce. This is really the last time I will eat here until they change alot of things about this place and attention to their customers and details."}
{"text":"The service was truly TERRIBLE. I arrived at 6:30 pm and due to the fact that our company was young, when we placed our order at 6:45 we had not been visited by a waiter still at 7:45. After proceeding to ask the sever THREE TIMES we were not served until 8. After, it took 35 minutes to receive 2 loaded ice creams for dessert. Then they messed up the bill 3 times, so that process took another half an hour. I will not be coming ever again due to the disrespect with which we were treated."}
{"text":"While they may not use the best wings, they definitely have some of the best sauces! They have my all time favorite wing sauce in the Mango Habanero. Go on a Tuesday if you're going for the first time and get the $.50 wings. The Buffalito's are also a great choice for switching it up, and you can add your favorite wing sauce to them as well. We always get nachos when going in large groups, which never disappoint."}
{"text":"I love wings! So of course  I love this place!! The wings are perfection and the people are wonderful. We went to see the game since the game had no parking at all. They were kind enough to change our tv to the game we wanted! Good service, yummy food! & SPORTS. What more could you want!"}
{"text":"We go here at the end of almost every month after class. It's a good time, everyone is always friendly, the staff is really accommodating to our group, and someone is always around to offer wing sauce samples.   I feel a little weird giving 5 stars to a chain restaurant, but I've never had any problems here, they've never gotten our order wrong, we've never even had to wait for seats!"}
{"text":"Update: We decided to try this place out again and we're glad we did!  Our server, Nick, was awesome.  There was a small service goof but it was quickly taken care of the correct way.  We have high hopes that they've worked out all the wrinkles and we'll be returning."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED but a fun place to meet, snack and watch sports.  Good beer selection."}
{"text":"Warning!!!!! Read all the other reviews before going here.   My family and I went here on a Tuesday for wing night. If I remember right wings are 65¢ for traditional wings. I'll start by saying I love Bdubs and their wide variety of beers and wing sauces. Which is awesome!  With that said here we go!  Service was completely horrible!! I couldn't tell you our waitresses name I think the hour in a half we were there she came by the table once which was because I flagged her down to get the check. We never got refills, the manager had to come by and fill them up which he was a pretty cool character but let the place run like a madhouse.   It was if no one there cared about their job nor the customers. You could clearly hear the kitchen staff yelling for \"runners\" and the staff to come get the food. But when you'd look over everyone was just sitting in the corner talking and hanging out. Even the manager just walked by and didn't do anything about it.   The food we got was just okay, nothing amazing I mean I've been to other Bdubs and have had better food. The food was cold and at that point it was just pointless to bother arguing about it.   When we finally got the waitress to bring us our check we waited over 20 minutes just for her to return my card I thought we'd never leave.  I can for sure say I'd never come back here as the staff is a complete bust and a waste of time. If the store in University was still open I would've just gone there. Just pass on this place."}
{"text":"I come here all the time B-Dubs has the best wings. I get the Hot BBQ or Nuclear and a basket of chips with chipotle BBQ on it. The beer specials are always a plus!  It's one of the best spots to go and watch a game at. A numerous amount of tvs displaying everything from golf football and basketball to UFC fights even wrestling at times. So a huge variety.   I love the spot it's not just a \"restaurant\" it's really a hang out spot"}
{"text":"Personnel is very friendly, lots of movement during game days, loads of tvs to watch your preferred game..."}
{"text":"I wish there was 1 BW's that actually had decent service.  We ordered dinner and an appetizer and waited over 35 minutes and the restaurant was barely half full.  The waitress didn't seem to care.  It took 3 requests to get silverware.  Plus, the food was only so-so.  Lastly, what restaurant only serves medium well cooked burgers.  No other option than almost burnt. This was our first and last visit to this BW's and last visit to any BW's. Ick."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst experience I have ever had at a bww. To start the bathrooms were disgusting, they were hot and dirty and smelled. That alone should have let me know what the rest of my experience was going to be like. Upon my arrival I spoke with a server on the patio and asked about coming in through the gate so that I would not have to bring my dog through the restaurant. I have been to a number of bwws and have never had an issue with my dog on their patio. The server told me it was fine to bring her through the restaurant so I carried my small dog through as I did not want to be rude. I ordered the Greek salad with chicken, which is what I regularly order. The hummus was literally inedible and the pita bread almost raw. The salad had multiple stalks from the bottom of the lettuce in it, which I don't know about you but I would not serve a salad like that to guests in my house let alone at a restaurant. While I was disappointed with the food I chalked it up to \"well it's a chain, probably shouldn't have high expectations.\" Then half way through our meal a manager came out and requested that I show him papers proving that my dog is a service dog. I did not have my purse on me, but I was wearing my medical walking boot. I have never been asked if my dog was a service animal on a patio in Arizona. I was then told that since I could not produce papers I would have to tie my dog up outside the patio where there is no shade and where she would constantly come back through the gate since she could fit through the bars. Not to mention walking on my busted ankle hurts enough, but the gates on the patio have alarms so to get her out there I was going to have to walk all the way out and around and then back the same way. My friend and I decided we would just try to finish our meal quickly, as I said we had already been there at least 30 minutes, but the manager came back out again. This time he brought a large man with him. I do not appreciate the fact that he was trying to physically intimidate me. At this I told him to just bring us boxes. This was literally the most ridiculous experience I have ever had at any restaurant and I will definitely not be returning. Not worth it to be subjected to such disrespect and low quality food."}
{"text":"To be quite honest with you, I think Buffalo Wild Wings is overrated. My boyfriend and I have been here twice, but there's nothing special about it compared to any other place.  My boyfriend prefers the wings here, compared to those at Pizza Hut that we usually get, but it's actually vice versa for me. For me, the BBQ sauce on the wings I got here tasted the same as what I can get at Pizza Hut. So why PAY more for less at B-Dubs when I can GET more for less at Pizza Hut?  The cheese curds, fried pickles, and shrimp tacos are good, but the appetizers are vastly overpriced. You get an extremely small order for the price of what should be enough for two people. It's just not worth it. Furthermore, out of all the desserts here, I've only tried the fried cheesecake bites and they weren't good at all. The texture was strange and the flavor was lacking.  Overall, I don't think I'll be going here anymore."}
{"text":"Their wings are decent, unfortunately I don't remember the couple of sauces that I wasn't please with. The thing that bothers me THE MOST though is the fact that they are going to nickel & dime customers over ranch & blue cheese. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? Now, I don't eat wings often, however isn't bleu cheese ALWAYS served with wings? I can understand charging for extras, but I stand by my assessment that this practice is ridiculous.  Based on this, I would only ever eat here on Tuesday, .60 cent wing night."}
{"text":"Probably my best experience at a BDubs! I completely forgot who our server's name was but he was very helpful with everything! I went with two of my friends to watch the USC Vs Stanford game on Friday night and it was PACKED inside. Still he had a great attitude with helping us and our food came out really quick!! We weren't even done with our appetizers and our wings already came out! They were even cool with us staying for the whole game and he still checked up on us throughout! I still can't believe how fast the food came out on such a packed night! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"While this location has the same look and feel as the chain overall, it is definitely a smaller, more compact, location. The seating here felt very cramped and we were both bumped into regularly throughout our meals by people walking by us (staff and other patrons).    We ordered ten wings and some fries to share between us since we were both just looking for a lighter lunch. The food came out after a little bit of a wait but everything was hot and prepped as ordered.    The game offerings are a big plus for this location since it's compact, you can really see the TV trivia games from any of the seats. They offer a free app to play along on your smartphone, or on one of their gaming devices if you prefer.   Overall: B Busy location, cramped seating, but fun games and the standard variety of wing options you expect from the chain."}
{"text":"First off I want to say I love Buffalo Wild Wings...now this is the 4th or 5th time I've been here and I'm going to share with you why I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5.  The service is usually always great however my complaint would be on the consistency of the wings.  On this visit today I ordered the parmesean garlic wings and they did not have enough flavor or sauce. Of course I asked the waitress at the bar for a cup of the parmesean garlic sauce and she quickly brought some out but this is the 3rd time out of 5 ordering the parmesean garlic wings when the flavor just wasn't there....  Everything else is great.  Maybe next time I will try a new flavor so that I'm not disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here wings are great.Their garlic parmasson are excellent. Nice cold beer. I will be back."}
{"text":"Their food is decent. The wings are usually good, but I wouldn't recommend the fries. The service here is not consistent. Sometimes they are nice and sometimes I feel like a nuisance. I've also noticed all Buffalo Wild Wings smell like a fast food playground...pretty unappetizing."}
{"text":"I attended my bestie's going away party here. She had won 50 free wings and invited us to pig out. We had our own little private room (I would have preferred to sit and mingle with the rest of the crowd). Service was good...football was playing...all's good."}
{"text":"Lame location. Usually don't have to have expectations going to a BWW as they are pretty consistent, this location was the worst. We were seated next to a high powered fan. When we asked to be moved the the host just redirected the fan. After finally being relocated our server got one of our orders wrong and never apologized. Instead we were told it would take 10-15 minutes to correct without offering anything free or discounted. Suffice it to say we took the discount out of her tip."}
{"text":"Service was spot on and the Lemon-Pepper dry rub hit the spot. It took a little longer then I thought it should. Our waitress was very attentive and kept the drinks full without issue. Potato skins with bacon, yes please."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for the FREE WiFi, food, & beer.  This particular location is the closest BWW to my house, so I frequent it the most.  Today I went for the Sampler.....Nachos, Cheese Sticks, Boneless Wings, and Onion Rings....yeah baby!  I thought the sampler was excellent, except the Nachos which were just OK in my book.  I'm not a huge fan of their Cheese/Chili combo on the Nachos.  Washed it down with an Apricot Wheat beer....went for the Ranger IPA next and then the other IPA they have on tap to end the day.  The place isn't too busy in the middle of the day, so it was nice to have most of the bar area to myself.  The server was awesome and very helpful.  Will I return?  Of course...I will be here often."}
{"text":"I was driving down Macleod trail and saw a fool in a Buffalo costume waving people in to this new restaurant in 30 + heat, and felt sorry for him.  This is the first one apparently in western Canada.  It's really kinda cool.   They have a massive selection of on tap beers big tvs a great bar, super friendly staff ( and lots of them), and a fairly upbeat atmosphere. The prices are decent and the food seems pretty good for what it is. If your into beer and wings this is the place.  I have had more bad wings than I can count, there's almost no such thing as good 25 cent wings anymore other than in my home town of Langley, bs and a quaint little place called the rendezvous.. But even those are 35 cents these days, but oh so worth it.  Sorry I was digressing thinking about those wings and waiting on these.......  Ok, so I ordered some salt and pepper wings just to judge the quality of the wings themselves.  I found them... Very salty and the salt they use is the very fine type, they should prolly go for the coarse type, but that's my opinion, the wings were a bit on the skinny side not too much meat to them but nicely cooked not over done, but then i am spoiled having the best wing pub in canada in my back yard.. Based on most places i have been to these are quite good...I would assume they would be very acceptable for the 65 cents they are on Tuesday's, smeared with any one of the nice sauces they offer.  Beers on special are 4.95 quite a good deal..  So next I ordered a black and blue burger.. They say in the menu that you should see the other burger... Like I suppose they were in a fight and this was the winner.. Hahahaha...  Well no doubt.. It is great... I love the square patty and the wedges are awesome... So come here already...  Hope you get Shay or Neilly as your waitress they are awesome!"}
{"text":"I can understand why this place gets crappy reviews, place is employed with teenagers & early 20 something's. I called to placed my order. I heard laughing as it was picked up, the FEMALE answered using a males name..Miguel? Michael? When I stated my purpose she asked me to please hold. For 30secs I waited, than a MALE answered using same name and took my order. :/ Wasn't amused.  I ordered the wings, of course. Desert Heat and Wild. Desert Heat is a dry rub but good. Wild was wet, good spice to it. They weren't great, would go somewhere else first but come here if disparate...."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this location, but it's not as good as the others.  I come here because a friend of mine comes here regularly, but I wouldn't come to this BWW otherwise.  My last visit was this past Thursday evening.  I was waiting for my friend in the bar and wanted to order a Ranger IPA.  I was told they didn't carry IPA on tap or bottled.....WTH?  The other location on North Durango & 215 has two IPA's on tap.....I was there 2 weeks ago, so I know they carry it.  I asked the waiter if they recently stopped selling IPA's and he said he didn't know and didn't even know what an IPA beer was!  I settled on a 24 oz Newcastle and put away 4 or 5 before the night was over.  Wow, I thought that BWW's were suppose to be consistent with their product.  I guess I was wrong.....whatever.  Will I come back?  Only when I come to visit my friend, otherwise I wouldn't come to this location.  There are better BWW's in Vegas."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here in the middle of the day during the week to study or work while using the FREE WiFi.  That's one of my favorite things about B-Dubs is the FREE WiFi.  I'll order a 6 pack or dozen Boneless Wings and just work away.  It's really hard not to have a Beer or two while studying so I'll cave every once in a while and grab a Blue Moon.  The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is great for hanging out.  Return Factor - 75%"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for quiet some time now. Truthfully, I have never had such horrible customer service until last night. I went in trying to order to-go and as I walk in to the take out area this lady greets me and  tells me I have to order from the bar. Shortly after I walk over to the bar and the employee working behind the bar then ask how may she help me and I had told her \"they sent me over here to order for take out.\" Her response was \"there's no one at take out?\" Then, she walks away attempting to help me goes over to the cash register where a few other employees had been standing then talks to one of them then walks back behind the bar and doesn't say a word to me at all. After standing there patiently I got impatient and walked back up to the front. I stood there for a good 5 mins waiting to be helped the hostess and other employees are looking at me not even attending to me and my family members until finally after 10 mins goes by another hostess/server finally asked if I needed any help. I told her how I was just trying to order for take out she sends me back to the take out area. No ones there. Afterwards I kindly saw a gentleman whom I thought was finally going to help me then tells me that I have to go to the bar at this point I was getting really irritated o was still not being helped. I walk back over to the front desk stand there for another good 5 more mins until someone tells me to just go to \"take out\" where had originally went to try and order in the first place. They basically kept sending me back and forth for a good 30 mins after that I just walked out. It makes me wonder if I was to be seated would have I been help than? They really need to up their customer service or get new employees who actually care to be there."}
{"text":"Finally!  B-Dubs returns to Scottsdale.  Ever since the location in North Scottsdale closed, I've been waiting for it to return.  They opened earlier this week and we were anxious to give it a try.  Since they were new, we were expecting the worst in customer service...there are always a few hiccups here and there during opening week....not here though!    We were greeted by smiling, friendly hostesses who seated us at a table in the bar area.  We asked if they could put on a specific baseball game on one of the TV's, and they accommodated.  Our server gave us a run down of the menu & specials.  I threw her for a loop when I asked for an IPA, it was National IPA Day...she didn't know what that was.  That's ok, most people under 21 don't know what that is.  She smiled and said she'd ask the bartender and let me know.  She promptly returned and told me that they had Hop Knot IPA and Firestone IPA....I ordered the Hop Knot IPA first, then the Firestone 2nd...yum!  For dinner, we ordered:  Queso & Chili Dip http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=35tWJX8t0jOppa8akUSfyQ#35tWJX8t0jOppa8akUSfyQ  Cheeseburger Sliders http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=MW6o7ZqiBpR3DI0Qdg4TTA#MW6o7ZqiBpR3DI0Qdg4TTA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=VcPnbq9ofF80r6IdSCM1yg#VcPnbq9ofF80r6IdSCM1yg  Boneless Wings, 40 cents ea. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/buffalo-wild-wings-scottsdale-2?select=mZsJCccMnqgBmSE_B6RXQw#mZsJCccMnqgBmSE_B6RXQw  The food came out rather quickly and we enjoyed our dinner while watching baseball games and shooting the breeze.  Our server remained attentive the entire time and ensured that we were good.  Overall, I am very impressed with their opening week.  I can't wait to come back during football season!"}
{"text":"I honestly never felt so disrespected. I am my wife come into the restaurant at 10:30pm which is 2:30 prior to closing. They were vacuuming with the most annoying vacuum I have ever heard. I asked is it possible to turn that office while we eat. The server came back after asking \"no we just started\". When it come to professionalism there was none. I honestly felt extremely disrespected and did not enjoy a thing. My wife and I got up and walked out. No one cared. Well if there is no care then I will never and I mean ever step a foot in this ridiculous establishment. I would recommend any to just skip it and go somewhere else. I promise those wings are not that great. Hope this finds a regional manager so that some changes can be made with this working staff for the future. I really do want places to succeed."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience here. I didn't like my food and they wouldn't refund it or even let me pay for what I ate. They wouldn't even let me swap it out for something else. The manager was rude, had a terrible attitude and she tried to argue with me. I will never come back. I attached a picture of the food that I barely ate. I could understand if I complained after eating my food, but I didn't even eat it. And the fact that I offered to pay for part of it, and she made me pay my whole bill is ridiculous. I wish I could have given them zero stars."}
{"text":"Not friendly. Takes forever even for drinks. And gave us like 3carrots and two celery sticks when we ordered a large traditional. I don't know if that is the \"rules\" but other locations always gave us more then that. Not only that we had to ask for utensils and never gave them to us, had to ask for the plates or whatever you call them to put our bones in. The wings were a mess with the hot sauce all over the other wings that were not supposed to be."}
{"text":"As good as any Buffalo Wild Wings.  Love the Asian zing wings.  A beer and those make my night!  I also had the buffalo chips which were also very good.  Good place for a quick meal and some beer."}
{"text":"The fact that I'm the Duke proves that Yelpers are smart enough to avoid Buffalo Wild Wings or savvy enough NOT to check in.  I find myself here out of necessity; there are few places that serve food after hours on a Wednesday in Gastonia.. and I skipped dinner tonight.   The food isn't great, but it's consistent. The restaurant (or is this a bar?) is clean.. And the staff depends on return service, so your server will generally make some attempt to be cordial and attentive.   I wish I could give this place a higher rating..but I simply don't like how generic the concept is.. It's the Old Navy of sports bars. Nothing wrong with it, if that's what you're looking for..but why would anyone look for that?"}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings was an awful experience. I tried to order online and then when I got to the restaurant, the order did not exist. I've been waiting in store for 30 minutes after ordering and people in front of me still have not received their orders. If I hadn't paid, I would have left already. This location was a terrible experience."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely ridiculous, horrible service. Waited over 35 min expecting a server to greet our table and get drink orders, the restaurant was not busy at all and yet servers were ignoring us and walking past. We brought it to the hostess' attention 3 times before getting the manager to come out, and even then she was rude and unapologetic about the situation."}
{"text":"TRUST the BAD REVIEWS!!!  This place is not worth the time.    My husband and I went this location on OCTOBER 7th around 7pm and found an open table in the bar area.  The manager was talking to customers 2 tables down from where we sat.  We were not even acknowledged by a server until 15 minutes after we sat down, and was told that someone would be with us shortly.  All of the other server and manager on duty ignored us.  After another 5-10 minutes of waiting for just a simple drink order, we decided to leave.  The manager watched us leave, but my husband let him know why we were leaving on our way out.    We understand that it can be busy at this time on a Saturday, but there were open tables and no need for this kind of service.  If you go on a weeknight, the service and food are much better.  Decided to add a few more stars, since we gave them another chance... and we we're much happier."}
{"text":"Amazing! I looove boneless honey BBQ wings! Every time I come here the bartenders and waitress are great, always polite and take care of what I need. The only downer it takes Sooooo long for the wings, even if there are no people there. Oh well everything else rocks. Great beer selection for a local bar."}
{"text":"Whomever said this is the McDonalds of wings was spot on.  No the service isn't five star. No the food isn't five star. Yes it is a chain restaurant. Yes the staff are likely minimum wage with lots of turnover. TV's and music too loud even on the patio which is next to a parking lot but they did turn it down when asked.   To the rest of the folks writing reviews I say ...what exactly were you expecting...?  We go about twice per month and I usually have the BBQ Chicken salad and my wife has the street tacos with shrimp substituted in.  Not five star but consistently pretty good, definitely a bigger salad than I can eat.  Annoying that they charge you 60 cents for an extra dressing. Servers are hit-n-miss but overall about what you would expect at a chain restaurant.  They are quick to right a mistake with 25 percent off or a free entrée if it wasn't what you ordered.   For example, I ordered a large beer and the keg ran out leaving about 1 inch at the top of the glass that normally would have had beer.  I didn't think much of it but a few minutes later after they swapped the keg out came another large beer to make up for the first.  Never had to ask nor did I expect it.  I'd say that's pretty good customer service.  I signed up for the blazin-rewards program a while back and this location, on more than one occasion, banks the points from customers that pay after you until (I think) someone else in the rewards program bumps you from the queue.  This turned into a free medium sized wings for us ($15) and I also used a survey credit ($5) on the same bill.  Lunch for the two of us that day was $8 including tip.  So lighten up, go eat something and enjoy the ice-cold beer."}
{"text":"Service sucked!! At least the 2 waitresses I had to deal with didn't know anything about customer service. Maybe it's just them."}
{"text":"Food sucks and staff is even worse. I can't believe that people pay to eat there. Their wings are usually dry (not enough sauce), glasses are dirty, silverware is dirty, servers are terrible and why can't they use plates instead of paper??? I don't like the atmosphere and I'm not going back."}
{"text":"very talented bar staff during happy hours. Cheap wings on tuesday. Lots of beer on tap. One of my favorite sports bars"}
{"text":"I like this place. I go at least twice a month. Of the year and a half or so that I've been going, they've messed up my order twice. The first time, they gave me a 50% discount. The second time, they charged my card more and so they gave me my meal free. (I then got my incorrect amount refunded back to my card) I was pleased with how they corrected their errors. I love the boneless wings and the mozzarella sticks!"}
{"text":"I like this BWW. I've had great service every time I have been here. The boneless wings are great and their selection of bear on tap is great. Come during happy hour and you can get a large beer for the price of a small. Yes, they might be more pricey than Wing Stop, but personally I think their wings are better, they have a better selection of sauces, and the ambiance is much better."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here but unfortunately never got served.  Waitresses were too busy standing around talking.  Finally gave up"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game with my kids and their friends. I always take the boys as they feel like they are at a pub. And they love the wings, I usually order a triple, so we can get 6 flavors of wings, I'm a fan of the saucy flavors over the dry, but it's all preference. If you like spicy, my favorite are the mango habanero and the hot. Kids love the teriyaki and honey garlic. Great place to hang out for hockey or basketball or any big sport events. They also sell some of the sauces, I bought the mango habanero, great at home w/ hash browns."}
{"text":"Came into this location about 5:30pm on a weeknight, asked to sit outside on the patio where it was pretty empty, restaurant wasn't full either! Waited and waited and waited for a server to come out but to no avail, had to go inside to find someone to come outside. Finally someone showed up and she didn't look to be too happy about it. We placed our drink orders, 2 martinis, 1 whiskey, 1 water, 20 minutes later still waiting for cocktails, finally, she showed back up and martinis were 1/2 filled, asked kindly if it was some sort of a joke, asked about the water with no ice that was requested and she pointed to a glass of ice water already on the table. Clearly she had no idea what she was doing, we went to get a manager and no one was in site at the front desk so we decided to get out of there before ordering any food...pretty sad since their wings are pretty decent!"}
{"text":"Yes, I know it's a chain. But I do like their wings and in mass quantities. Especially the spicy garlic and the caribbean jerk. Let me say that that's the only thing I order there. I have been disappointed by their other apps and tried a burger once = meh. Sooo I stick with what they actually do best...wings. They always have beer specials and keep up with seasonal brews. They have those nice tall glasses that look like baseball bats/ yard glasses."}
{"text":"Honestly. Like every other Bw place  but the draft beer is overpriced and then they give you a 3/4 full glass.  Not cool. Bartender says its corporate but its still a ripoff.  Seemed like when we complained it got worse. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Solid BW3. Good food and good service. All of the waiters and waitresses are friendly, as are the bartenders. My only complaint is that the kitchen does not put enough sauce in the wraps. The last time I was there my buffalo ranch wrap had no ranch and only a little bit of mild sauce."}
{"text":"I went in the other day just to grab a beer and a snack while the game was on.  They brought my snack size wings and I had to wait about 5 minutes to even get silverware.  No biggie.  I get my check and give the 'captain' my ATM card.  When he brings back the slip, the amount was $22 not the $16 I originally saw.  I asked him if he could show me the original check because the amount seemed too high.  He hands over the check which was all crumpled up.  I told him that wasn't even mine.  He asks for my card back.  I was thinking they would issue a credit for the $6 or so they over charged me.  Nope.  The original $22 was voided and $16 was charged.  No one bothered to tell me that is how they were going to handle the situation.  He explains it will take a few days depending on the bank for me to get my money back.  How does this help the customer?  I was polite about it and still gave a tip though I was upset about it.  A day later, I check online and they actually slid my card three times: $16, $16 and $22.  This all for a snack sized wings and a beer.  No one ever mentioned that they slid it three times.  If you are going to illegially authorize $54 instead of the $16 I agreed to, it may be nice to mention that.  I call and ask to speak with a Manager.  He made it clear that it was my bank who was causing the delay.  He didn't seem to understand that you don't just keep sliding someone's card since the funds are held.  He didn't offer to comp anything and didn't even seem to understand why I was upset.  He just said if the bank doesn't clear out the 3rd charge (since I only got a void receipt for one) that he would take care of it.  Will I be going back?  Ummmmmm....no."}
{"text":"I came to have lunch with my girlfriend and the staff was really friendly and helped us out right away. I recommend them if your looking for a quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"The waitress crystal is HORRIBLE. Me and my family went and we waited at least 30 min for her to help us. The food was amazing as always but NEVER GET CRYSTAL AS A WAITRESS. was not even busy and it took forever."}
{"text":"The  reservation was made for the fantasy football for 8 and we requested a power strip and extension cords when we did. At arrival, we had 1 table and one booth separated, no power cords or extensions and Mike the manager looked clueless!!  It's been a tradition to watch it here. Never had issues, until now. Maybe Mike, the manager is the change!"}
{"text":"After a group of 4 of us arrived at 6pm on a Sunday and were seated, I had to ask the greeter for a waitress after 15 minutes.  The waitress missed 2 items on our order and did not come back for drink refills until after 3 people were done eating.  It then took another 10 minutes to get our bill.  The manager can over and I wanted to tell him how bad the service was, but he did not let any of us finish the food in our mouth before waking away.  This is my worst Buffalo Wild Wings experience and I will not be back for a long time."}
{"text":"Literally the WORST service I have EVER experienced. First off, we walk in and the host doesn't even greet us with a smile or anything, the first thing she says is \"YOU CANT BE IN HERE WITH THAT ON\" my friend and I had on bathing suit cover ups. COVER UPS! It's not like our we were naked and second of all, it's VEGAS! So we ended up running next store to by shirts to put on since we really wanted BWW. Anyways, Our server was Phoenix and he treated my friends and I like complete shit. When we got seated he asked if we would be needing separate checks and we said yes, long story short, EVERYHING was an issue for him! It was so bad, we thought we were being PUNKD! We ended up not ordering anything and left! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"First time here, came for a draft party. Didn't have wings but had Buffalo Blue Burger (TO DIE FOR) Didn't like table they reserved for us too high (I am short) Floor was a little greasy & sticky so if I leaned on table it kept sliding Waitress was very attentive and fast especially to toddler in our party (big+ for the crushed ice) Would definitely come back here to try the wings but oh the burger is so gooood! Atmosphere is fun and friendly!"}
{"text":"Take out is terrible here. Ordered online and it was supposed to be ready at 5. Food finally came out after 5:30. All the food was cold except the wings. Cold fries, cheese curds chicken fingers and onion rings are not very good. This is at least the third time I've waited over half hour from the time I was quoted to pick up. I really want to be able to pick up from here but it's a waste of my money"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken ceasar, 10 wings, and fries bucket TOGO. Fries were cold and starchy. Salad was warm and didnt even fill a third of the bowl... wont be back. Second chance with these guys first time we experienced extremely slow service and no updates. Had to chase down waiters and bartenders to figure food times."}
{"text":"This will be my last and final time coming to BWW...  I'm sorry I use to be a huge fan. This location by far has the worst service... there are three location and so far the best location is Monona and East side.  I refuse to go to Fitchburg location.  Not only that the service was bad but the food wasn't great either again I've been to this location so many times and didn't think about writing a review because I wanted to give it a few more chances especially being a server/bartender myself I know.  I don't feel bad about writing this review.  I even talked to the manager a few months ago politely explaining my experience who was not apologetic at all and just stared at me. She then goes \"are you trying to get compensated\" in all honestly no I was not, I still tipped your server 20% but I wanted to express how I felt without giving you guys a bad rep.  And now I just about had it."}
{"text":"I just went to this restaurant after it opened. The problem is not really with the food but with the atmosphere. The music was extremely loud. No one could talk to each other at our own table. Another issue was how they were serving the beer. They bought us a beer that had the top of the head a good half inch to inch below the top of the glass, This was consistent for all 3 of our beers. One person in our group mentioned this to the server that delivered them and we were told this was the proper way it was to be served. After we looked at all the other beers being brought out, they were all with the head at the top of the glass. We spoke to the manager about it when he came by to check on us and he said again that ours were served properly. We showed him all the other beers and he said, \"Huh?\" It would seem that a new place would be interested in feedback and try to take it in a little better than in a more confrontational way.  The food was good. The majority of us had wings. They had a ton of flavors which was nice. Unfortunately, you have to order a minimum of 6 of a flavor so it doesn't leave much opportunity for experimenting. I had the Caribbean Jerk and the Parmesan. They were good just not enough to really entice me to come back. There are some other places near by with great wings and we can actually talk to each other when we go."}
{"text":"Ate here last night. 4 hours later, puking my soul out. And still am more than 12 hours later. Go here if you want food poisoning :-)   Service stinks. My friends had their food and were half way done by the time I finally got my meal.  The only reason I'm giving it a star is because our waitress was so amazing. Wish I could remember her name."}
{"text":"Drea is one of the best waitresses at this location. She is attentive, friendly, and not overbearing. Hope to be seated in her area on my next visit."}
{"text":"I'm here visiting from Mexico for my birthday to celebrate in Vegas, stop by to eat here. My Mexican driver license expires on my b-day and they couldn't serve me alcohol cus is 1 week expired. So since it expires 1 week ago I'm not 25 no more. Ordered the wings, half of them were cold but felt lil warm since the other ones where close to them.... Got no celery nor carrots I had to request for it half way my meal. I've been on BWW before at Hollywood and their service is awesome. I expected the same here too bad it was a big disappointment"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. One star rating is an overly nice way of telling you what my mother said about if you cannot say something nice, don't say anything...but my wife and I felt underwhelmed.  Arrived in the middle of the afternoon. Very slow. Front cash register was where all employees seems to be. Music was loud. The multiple TVs were all showing a variety of sports events, but nothing live. Carpets were filthy. One employee had a constant need to pull and fix her long hair. Not sure if she was a server, but I worry if she handled food. Lots of loud conversation at that register.   The greeter sat us and proceeded to babble a paragraph of mumbles about something about the several beers they offered. I asked her to repeat, but still had a tough time understanding. We then met their \"Guest Experience Captain\". She was also hard to understand and my wife and I enjoyed the irony of being offered the guest experience captain and wondered if she had subordinates, but never had the opportunity to ask, because she blew out of there immediately and we noticed a replacement who never came by, only because she was wearing a football jersey identifying her.  The food. Greasy, bland bar food. Not priced right for that atmosphere. Overpriced. $15 for wings? I guess drinking makes the price palatable. This will make twice that I ate there...my first and last.  The city of Buffalo should sue."}
{"text":"Absolute best BWW in the valley. The service and consistency of quality has made me a regular.  Phenomenal Service Great and large variety of food"}
{"text":"We ordered a medium size boneless wing order with medium sauce and large french fries.  We got ripped off big time...see the picture, what are there 10 chunks with sauce not on all pieces?  This cost $15.99 for 10 cold small boneless pieces  and sauce poured on them. Gobbs of sauce on the bottom of dish, several pieces with partial sauce. The fries were also cold. First time at this BWW and it was very bad. Really, 10 pieces for $15.99?  And cold and sauce poured on some pieces but not all. We were starving so we ate this garbage. This was the worst portion meal and cold food I've ever had anywhere. Manager should be in prison for theft. I work for my money and they stole it. Would have been better off going to the Dollar store and buying their frozen rubber chicken. The beer was pretty good though at BWW."}
{"text":"I used to work around the corner. With free wifi available, I made BW3's my second office. The waitresses were always friendly, remembered my favorites, and didn't mind that I sat there for hours on my computer.  The coffee service isn't too good though. So, I would stick to soft drinks or beer!"}
{"text":"It was kind of late, just wanted a couple drinks and wings, hostess Yomi was very informative and friendly. Bartender Michelle kept the drinks coming and our waters full . Overall exceptional service, felt like my lemon pepper wings were a little dry but granted there's no sauce on them lmao. Will definitely be back ! Thanks guys !"}
{"text":"We were at Gene Autry baseball fields for a morning game that lasted until 1pm and then we just had to get something to eat before heading back to Scottsdale.   One of the guys had mentioned seeing this place, and it seemed like a perfect spot for a bunch of smelly ball players after a hot winning game. There were about 13 of us and we ventured on in. The restaurant was clean and the perfect sport bar/restaurant. Tons of tvs and very friendly staff. They pulled together four tables for us and got us started on drinks a computer game for playing trivia.   Our waitress, meigken (not sure on the spelling, but the pronunciation was MIKEN) was very friendly and outgoing. She had enough spunk and quick retorts for even our best smart a*& in the bunch. It was great! We all got our drink orders and proceeded to place our food orders. They had some specials with pulled pork slammers, some good looking appetizers, wings, ribs, wraps, lots of choices.   Several of the guys ordered the slammers, and I ordered a naked tenders wrap with honey mustard. Our first attempt at the trivia was pittiful until a bunch of the guys began noticing what was going on. More brains are better, I have decided. Our meals showed up and we all started eating. The pulled pork slammers were delicious. The sauce on the pulled pork was great, just what I like. My naked tender wrap was light, but tasty. I did put some medium wing sauce on there to spice it up a bit. I like spicy and the medium was right up my alley.   Everyone seemed to enjoy their food. No real complaints to speak of. The service was excellent. All 13 orders showed up as ordered and the boys were content with their lunch. Who knows if it would have been different with a loss on the field, but I think the place got good remarks all around. All bellies content and it was back to all of our respective resorts/condos for a nap."}
{"text":"I normally dine in at BDubs but tonight I did not have enough time so I ordered take out. I would have to say that the customer service was outstanding. Jessica took my order and was very helpful and she actually was the reason that I order a side of fries. She sold it to me perfectly. She told me that my order would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes and it was spot on. I arrived in 18 minutes and the food was hot and ready to go. I would like to give Jessica 6 starts but we all know that's not possible. Once again, BDubs doesn't disappoint and I will continue to eat at BDubs!!! Thanks for dinner."}
{"text":"Good 'ole B Dubs. This place will be kicking over Spring Training. Built right across from and old Hooters, the location, food, and service are better. I recommend the Spicy Garlic bone in with blue cheese, but that's just me.  Great place to watch any sporting event. Plenty of beers on tap for the beer snob in you life. Service can be flawed at times but the staff is empowered to correct any issues. I'll be back...again and again and again..."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and they do a pretty good job of things. They do get a little busy sometimes which is to be expected and it seems that sometimes the servers seem a little overwhelmed but they still take the correct orders and food comes out hot. Dave the manager is also pretty aware of whats going on and stops by all the tables to check on them which is awesome, so thank you for always making sure your guests are happy."}
{"text":"Went in around 11pm on a Saturday night. Surprisingly there were empty tables all around. One group came in after ours and we noticed there was one table that consisted of about 4 people total that was already there.   It took a good couple minutes for our server to come by and even longer for us to get water. 20 minutes had past before our server came to ask for our orders. The group of 4 that was there before us had already left. They must have been even more frustrated than us because they didn't even have any food out, just their waters.   I'm pretty sure we would've left also, but we had a big party of 7 with kids included too and they were already grumpy. It was late and we were all hungry.   Took forever for water refills. 25+ mins after our order was put in and our food still wasn't ready. Usually I'm never one to complain about how long it takes for food to cook, but it was only bothering me because there were no tables around! We requested to speak to a manager and she said our server was still in training so that was why it was taking longer than expected. Also, I understand if someone is new, but why schedule a new person by themselves on a Saturday night? Also, what does the speed of the food cooking have to do with someone being new?!"}
{"text":"Beer wings sports.... Can't beat it Lots of TVs to watch your favorite teams.  The variety of wing sauces is sure to make any wing lover happy."}
{"text":"Food is reasonable, but we go for the environment. Love that we can watch the Olympics while eating wings. Service was a bit too slow.  We opted for an early family Valentine's Day dinner (Thursday instead of Friday), but we ended up being out way too late with kids because of the slow service."}
{"text":"Went in an hour and a half before closing the host was rude I understand he was probably tired but he gave extreme attitude, I was about to walk out because it was insane"}
{"text":"Sad this is the closest BWW to me, because it is by far the worst I've been to. The service has always been slow here, not a big deal, but now is also unfriendly and poor, so after 1.5 years of frequenting, I will no longer be going back ever again. On my most recent visit (when the restaurant was not busy at all btw), our waiter was clearly so unhappy to be working, took 20 minutes to even take our drink orders, got multiple drink and food orders wrong, didn't bring obvious things like napkins, would take 10 minutes to track him down to ask for napkins. Will just have to drive further to a different location."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I'v never been a fan so I never ate when my family would go. Not to mention heartburn galore.  It's likely good for the tailgating, sports watching people who eat before going and just have beers and appetizers. It can definitely accommodate TV sporting events. It has several TV everywhere and one main big one that the speakers go to."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to go for chicken wings. I love their traditional mango habanero wings, so spicy & sweet... Finger licking good ;). They have a variety of flavors to choose from. Tuesday's are the best day of the week to come because the wings are 1/2 off."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Many BWW's for years and this location about 5 times in last 10 months...  Two complaints:  Noisy (we go for wings, not sports bar atmosphere...so try to hit off times)  and COST...wings are getting outrageous...we spend $30-40 for dinner for two without alcohol.  Service is great.  Curry wings are to die for.  tons of flavors.  Manager took awesome care of us when half our wings came out cold on one of our many trips..  even in the busy times, we have never had a bad or inattentive waitress. We'll continue to go as often as our budget and waistlines can afford tit:)  ."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday midnight/Tuesday and they started their Tuesday wings special which was great! They have Happy Hour 10pm-6am! That rocks! Their drinks were great and I had a great time late night when the place is slow and quiet, not routy or crowded. Tuesday traditional wings are $.60 or .65! Cocktails and beers at happy hour are $3!"}
{"text":"Called to make a pick up order late Christmas night, and Denny, the employee who picked up my call was straight up RUDE. Like, bruh, I'm sorry you had to work on Christmas, but to speak to your customers the way you did was incredibly unnecessary and uncalled for. He was rushing and was condescending when we were trying to figure out how to order saying \"is this the last time you're gonna change your order or what?\" Like, whaaat? Lol Regardless, ended up leaving a 30% tip because it was Christmas but regretted it when I realized they didn't give the right amount of wings. Not cool, bruh. Never had a problem with anybody there before, so please work on your customer service ESP during the holidays."}
{"text":"I have been this Buffalo just a few times. However, I always enjoy my time here. The fact that they stay open late is a definite plus. Recently I made a trip here for my sister's 20th birthday celebration. Her friends, being the sneaky snakes that they are, got the waiters to bring her a peice of cake and sing to her (which is something they don't normally do). She loved it. The entire experience was great. The waiters are friendly and the food was really good. Usually I order the medium boneless wings and the southwestern dippers to start off with. I can't say much for their alcoholic beverages, despite the fact that I am now 21, I've never gotten a drink there. The happy hour menu, is pretty legit."}
{"text":"This location is never busy when I am here, yet it is always extremely loud.... which is cool, I totally expect it because it is a sports bar. It still confuses me how the eight people in there can make it sound like a mob of 100 people.  I will say, though, that I much prefer the location in Avondale. I feel like the servers here aren't as friendly because they are bored out of their minds and that all they want to do is leave.  The food is consistent with the other locations I have been too, which is a good thing. I really love the chocolate fudge cake (I may have mentioned that in my review about the other location). It is so good. How can you not love chocolate cake frosted with chocolate and then topped off with chocolate chips? Yummy.  Overall, I will continue to go to this location, but I still prefer the Avondale location."}
{"text":"Service was Great!!! With 3 boys we EAT!!!! The server was really cool and genuinely seemed interested in the conversations. Had the boys laughing and just got it. I didn't have to ask to get another beer and my boys really enjoyed being apart of the conversation unlike most places and servers who shine away from the kids. It's BDubs!!! Wings were on point and kickass vibes with the outdoor seating. Price isn't bad and they run promotions throughout the year. There are so many great places in West Gate I feel like this place gets over looked although it's always busy, I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I wish that 0 star. We went there with 2 kids were very hungry and thirsty. We waited for more than 15 minutes, no one come and ask for anything...  Really bad services and never care about customer.  What is the same??? You should close ur restaurant..."}
{"text":"Great burger for lunch today. Also sub'd a side salad for the fries, cutting the carbs! Sat in the bar area, pretty busy for a Thursday lunch and service (Dayton) was top notch! Great lunch visit today, will return!"}
{"text":"Tuesday Happy Hour menu is my favorite and the wings are only 60cents. Only bad things is sitting at the bar area and the staff is all around the place so service isn't the best."}
{"text":"I've been too many bww and all have been outstanding but with this location it doesn't even deserve a star. They have messed up on our order several times. And this time was the last straw. I come in thinking my order is either ready or will be ready within a couple minutes but little did I know, the cashier comes back speaking with her coworker saying she made a mistake and gave OUR order to the previous customer and didn't inform me about HER mistake. Better yet she told a manager her mistake and all they did was walk off. I waited an additional 20 minutes for my order while customer who came in after me left before me. When finally our order came out and all the cashier had to say was I'm sorry that took so long. She didn't apologize for her mistake, let alone tell me she made the mistake! I had to point it out. The worst bww I've been to by far"}
{"text":"Disgusting.  Went here with a dozen people from work and everyone didn't like the food. None of us will be going back.  Small wings with sub-par flavored.  Veggies were soggy, pickled willies tasted they came straight out of a packet.  Gross..!!"}
{"text":"We do take out now. It's cheaper. But always enjoyed the servers here. The place seems a little run down. Not so clean. Good wings and beer!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch sporting events especially if you're into UFC or Boxing, b/c they don't charge a fee to watch big fights unlike some other places. Lots of high def TV screens that you can definitely catch all the football and basketball games as well. Food is okay. I used to like the wings and how they offer so many different sauces. But to be honest, it's not that great. Good beer options though."}
{"text":"Haven't been a patron a BWW in years but have always missed the potato wedges.  I got the same meal I had years ago which was the Buffalo chicken sandwich with potato wedges by phone as I was headed out of town.  I arrived and waitress mistaken me for a buffalo wrap but the meal was corrected.  Took a while and it was a busy night (super bowl weekend).  I had a tea with my order but it wasn't prepared and I left forgetting about it ($2.$$).  My sandwich seemed kinda light for its value and there was a LOUD red onion on it.  I love onions but my goodness this onion ring went through my nostrils.  Not sure if I'll try anything else.  Maybe I'll be back for a different sandwich or wings."}
{"text":"Asked a server named Bobby who was walking by our table for water looks at us and says \"oh I'm off\" then pulled his phone out and walked away. This is the most ridiculous and disrespectful thing I've ever encountered. Don't walk around in your uniform around tables if you aren't prepared to do your job. Unbelievable"}
{"text":"First here I will be back Morgan was the best I recommend coming here best food ever and fast services ever"}
{"text":"Franchises tend to be a little tough to judge since it's difficult to hold each one at the same standard. However, my experience at Buffalo Wild Wings (B'dubs) here in Charlotte never leaves me unsatisfied.  To begin with, the real estate is huge and located right next to the NASCAR museum. They've got a whole block and a half of restaurant space that includes indoor / outdoor seating and a large central bar. I'd say there are at least 30 TVs (various sizes, 45 in+) surrounding you as you eat. Often you'll see the evening's game on the big screen (in which case the restaurant is packed), or UFC Championship Fights, or sports discussions with celebrities that you can't actually hear :P The general vibe of the place is upbeat and the staff is usually quite friendly.  When it comes down to the menu, I have to comment on the variety that's available at your fingertips. Not feeling wings today? They've got burgers. You don't eat beef? Chicken wraps and popcorn shrimp! Vegetarian? Fried pickles! Seriously, it would probably take you awhile to try everything on the menu, but each item appears to revolve around the B'dub special sauces. I will review each one for you here:  Sweet BBQ - Nice Sweet BBQ Southern Flavor, easy on the tongue Teriyaki - Not the best, also sweet, slightly tangy, not very Asian Mild - Classic Buffalo Parmesan Garlic - It's like eating a Ceasar Dressing Wing Medium - Classic Buffalo Honey BBQ - One of my favorites, nice honey and smoky flavor Spicy Garlic - Another great one, getting spicier, pasty texture, garlicky Jammin' Jalapeno - This one is good, limited time only, not much jalepeno taste, more lime and sweetness Asian Zing - Like Sweet Asian Pepper Sauce for your Crab Rangoons Caribbean Jerk - Very Peppery, not that spicy, ...has a jerk flavor? Thai Curry - Salty as hell, very much a thai curry flavor, it's slightly confusing Hot BBQ - Quite hot, spice almost masks the bbq flavor Hot - Classic Buffalo Mango Habanero - All time favorite, except it can be difficult to handle the spice for prolonged periods of time. This one will blow your head off. It's deceptively sweet until the heat kicks in with a 2 second delay. Not much mango, but  still tons of fruity flavor. Wild - Getting to the point where it's unbearably hot Blazin' - You'll get the runs.  If you're not into the sauces, they have dry rubs too, which are.... dry. Stick to the classics ;)  And If you don't like bones, you can go ahead and have the tenders. Occasionally, they'll do something like half off wings or all you can eat wings on the weekday lunch hour, which is good if you can pack away an insane amount of wings in a 2-3 hr span. I've had the limited edition Captain Morgan flavor, which is another favorite, I highly recommend. Nice rum flavor.  All in all, good for groups, sports, food, and drinks. When it's packed though, your order can take a long time. Be warned!  4/5"}
{"text":"This location really needs better management and more sufficient busers the wait time is ridiculous. Food is still delicious great work cooks !"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. The wings were on point. Food took a little long to arrive to the table and even longer to have our server bring us our check. Alex was a very nice guy however the service is extremely slow. There was a lot empty tables so I don't understand why they took forever.   I want to give this place a try again maybe my score will be 5 stars"}
{"text":"Walked in and waited for 15 minutes before someone even attended to me. There were 4 people in their uniforms just staring at me and proceeded to go back to talking to each other. Then just when I thought they would actually come to me two employees came up to the register and started arguing for another 5 minutes and continued to ignore me. Finally another lady came out and answered a phone call before helping me even though I've been waiting for awhile now.   When I finally got my food, my fries were rock hard (pictured below) and my wings barely had any sauce.   So disappointed. I love Buffalo Wild Wings but this will be the last time I will go to one if this is the kind of service they give to their customers."}
{"text":"I ordered some boneless wings over the phone and once I got there, realized I was at the wrong location. The manager just happened to be at the front desk and let me know they would have my order out soon. It was out within 3 minutes and they gave me even more than I ordered. Great customer service, even when the customer is the one at fault!"}
{"text":"I love this location.  It is never too crowded and the food is always great.    The only problem is every once in a while you find a staff member that really just isn't that good.  If the staff were a little better, it would get a 5/5.  I love going here.    My wife complains because I always mention going here if we are thinking about going out."}
{"text":"First time to this location. My boyfriend and I went last night. And are waitress was pretty good but she didn't really refill are drinks. I mean we are eating wings. The food took forever I even saw ppl are that came after us get stuff before us. She did  go check on our order. That's why I didn't give them 1 star.  Everything did take forever. Thank god I had a gift card because if it was my money I would be upset. I have one more but I won't be going here"}
{"text":"Just sort of average for your typical chain restaurant but good enough to scratch the itch.  I had the grilled chicken \"buffalitos\" which were actually pretty good.  It was 2 soft shell tacos filled with grilled chicken, lettuce, pico and a sauce of your choice.  I do like their choice of bbq sauces and always choose at least medium hot to combat the typical flavorless food often served to the masses.  It comes with chips and salsa which worked for me.  They offer alternate sides including a veggie boat which is just raw carrots and celery with a $.45 up charge.  C'mon guys, you can do better than that.  Give us some cooked green beans or steamed broccoli and skip the up charge, it's just veggies.  Finally, this place is LOUD with all the TVs going on.  We virtually had to shout at our waiter.  Conversation at the table wasn't too bad since we were close to each other.  Still they could back off on this \"ambiance\" for a better dining experience.  We ended up here because it is what the group chose.  Definitely not the worst choice but I don't see just the two of us choosing to eat here on our own."}
{"text":"Love this place. Yummy food for such a great price. Lots of TVs as well to be able to see different games at the same time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and was seated right away. Our server was horrible. She didn't really paid any attention to us and basically ignored us. She had our drinks order (didn't write it down) and 5 minutes later came back and told us she forgot our order. I ordered the Bayou Po'Boy and it was alright. I think they do use frozen shrimp because my shrimp tasted really funky. Although, the beer battered onion rings was amazing! It tasted so good. Then, our server never came with silverware and we asked her to bring us some and we had 4 people at our table with things that needs to be picked up by silverware and she only brought 2 over. Really? Come on now! Then, she gave us the bill and we never saw her again even though we stayed and talked for a lil bit. She definitely ruined our night. Might not come here for a while."}
{"text":"Always great service... Mango habanero wings always brings me back!! My son loves the Asian zing!! So many favors to choose from!!"}
{"text":"Somehow, my partner and I ended up at this location 45 minutes before the Women's World Cup game was about to start. That should have been a red flag to leave, but we were so hungry we decided to stick around.  That was a mistake.  We were seated after waiting about 15 minutes, and - although we weren't there for the game - we actually got a pretty decent seat to see the giant screens. Our waiter was quick to get our drinks ready, but after that instance it was like he disappeared. We were serviced by a Captain, whose name was Alex, and he was very friendly and helped us try sauces.   Our waiter, on the other hand, took 25 minutes to refill our sodas - which was odd, considering we sat at the table right next to the soda fountains. He also only came over once to ask us how our food was.   When we finally received our food, we realized my partner's fries had not shown up. We told three different employees, and it wasn't until the last employee we told that we finally got his fries - which was about 15 minutes after our food was served to us.   I get that Bdubs gets busy - especially during sporting events - but the fact that my partner and I watched our waiter service other tables and NOT ours was incredibly insulting. Not to mention we were halfway through our meals before we finally received our french fries. My experiences here are always mediocre, but this by far was the worst. I plan to avoid this location, and try another location or just avoid BWW altogether."}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings is better and larger than a majority of the other Bww I have been to in the past. Obviously being a sports bar, they have an abundance of TVs. The food is hit and miss. I typically get wings and it is hard to mess them up but I have had more than one bad experience. The other reason I gave three stars is that the service is usually decent but not great with how many waiters they have on."}
{"text":"Checked in from the parking lot so I could remember to write a review. My husband REALLY wanted to eat at B dubs tonight, because we found one in our new neighborhood in the Northwest and he was extremely excited. The only reason we left our house on a Friday night was to come to this restaurant.   There appeared to be a line from the outside, so we parked the car and called just to make sure we can get a table in a reasonable amount of time. Girl answering the phone screamed in laughter when she answered and then continued to yell into the phone to greet me. I asked how long the wait was and she said \"Probably... wait how many of you are there? \"I told her there were only two of us and she said \"We have tables open,  no wait come in now.\" We shut off the car and walked inside, and the girl with the white shirt on and a pixie haircut, who I can only presume is the manager, to this if there's a 20 minute wait for the two of us. We said \"Oh...really? We literally just called from the parking lot and they said their tables were open to come on in.\" She said, \"Okay.\"  We turn to leave, and she said, \"You can sit at the bar.\" We said \"No, thank you.\" She said, \"You don't want to sit at the bar?\" We left. Some people don't want to sit at a bar with a poker machine embedded in it, in an uncomfortable chair, yelling over sports fans to spend time with their significant other. Mainly, don't tell us to come in when there isn't a spot for us.  I'm writing this review from a booth at BJ's Restaurant down the street, where we will spend our money this evening.   Poor customer service in the phone, terrible customer service by the person you can only presume is the manager, the music was so loud when we went in that we had to strain to hear the rudeness, and the parking lot sprinklers are shooting up in the air making a muddy mess all over. Get your shy together, BDubs."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Buffalo Wild Wings!!!!! And I live in the North Phoenix area, and there are several locations but their service and the quality of the food is poor. Our waiter Josh was awsome, if your ever in the Surprise area Tuesday-Saturday ask for Josh!!!! He is the bomb, and it doesn't take a lot to be polite!!!! Thank you again Josh for your great service"}
{"text":"Love the food but when you order for take out the proportion of food is cut by atleast half. If your hungry eat in."}
{"text":"Great food, just like any other Buffalo Wild Wings you've been to. This one is worth going to, staff is friendly and the service was fast!"}
{"text":"BWW is a really nice place when it comes to chicken..wWen it comes to workers at the To-Go register, the workers are really rude and mean. Especially a worker named, McKenzie. Never came across a rude person like her. Just because of their poor attitude, I am not willing to give more than 2 stars for this place.  Be careful when you order from the To-Go area, they can talk behind you about your orders and be rude."}
{"text":"This was a pretty standard Buffalo Wild Wings. It was very clean and we got seated quickly. Food was hot and came out at a reasonable time. Service was weird...we were well taken care of between two servers, one who seemed to be covering for the other in the beginning? Not sure what the exact issue was but the bottom line was no issue with the service :-) they also support UW organizations (we were there for an Ask Listen Save function) which gives them 5 stars in my boom!"}
{"text":"As far as bdubs go this one was pretty standard. Nice to get a seat right away at 6 pm and service was average. Food was similar to every other Buffalo Wild Wings, came our hot and in a timely manner. Only real complaint was that it was pretty dingy, and my fiancé saw fruit flies above our food multiple times. Overall there are probably lots of better places to go in the Tempe university area, but there was no glaring sign not to go back here. Good for those who are ok with a little filth and looking for a standard meal that is not out of the ordinary"}
{"text":"Poor customer service, from top to bottom.  There's a reason this place is empty during sporting events"}
{"text":"Kind of a miss tonight.  The seven of us from work decided that this was the place for dinner. We were seated pretty quick on the patio by ourselves. Our server's name was Angela who was very pleasant. She took our drink orders and disappeared, the sodas came out quickly but the bar stuff took several extra minutes, the the server disappeared. She came back and took our appetizer order and then disappeared ( you are starting to get the idea) it took 90 minutes for most of us to get our dinner, we were actually afraid to ask for refills or anything else for fear we would never see our server again!   The manager on duty came over and was very pleasant and apologized and promised to investigate the speed of service, when she came back she offered us 25% off our bill.   Server brought us our checks (yes we split the bill) and no discount! And she disappeared, she came back and we explained the there was no discount on the bills, she gathered them up and disappeared and then she's back and announced that it was fixed! We examined the bill and on my check it said \"10 card 25%\" but the discount off the food before tax was NINE percent.  We gave up BWW had won, we paid, tipped a small amount and headed for the door we stopped by the manager and asked for a quick math lesson who explained that the friends and family discount we got didn't cover what we bought. I thought we were getting 25%?   So bottom line service was S L O W, food was very good! Manager not so much.  Everyone was very pleasant. I am going to pass on this place next time."}
{"text":"I had decided to give Buffalo Wild Wings another chance after finding a bird feather in my food during the last visit. I talked to the manager last time I had found the feather in my food and he was very understanding and apologized about the quality control, promising me that it won't happen again. So tonight I had ordered another 10 Traditional Buffalo Dry Rub, 6 Traditional Asian Zing, 6 Traditional Spicy Garlic, and a ranch. When I got home, I found another bird feather in my food. I called the store and the cashier directed me to a female manager by the name of Kristina. This lady was so rude to me and was trying to convince me that having feathers in the chicken is normal for Buffalo Wild Wings. I HAVE NEVER HAD FEATHERS IN MY FOOD OTHER THEN WHEN I ATE AT BUFFALO WILD WINGS. I questioned her about the quality control over food before serving it to the customers and she cut me off by saying that they go through several processes before serving anything to their customers. If that is so, then why has there been feathers in my food the last two times I had eaten at Buffalo Wild Wing? I've been going to Buffalo Wild Wings since I was a kid and now I will never eat here again.   Disgusting..."}
{"text":"I've seriously had it with this place.  My last few visits have been horrible and today I walked out because I just couldn't get sit down in an empty booth and be served.  When I came here a couple months ago, I explained to the server I was on lunch and needed to be out quickly.  They said no problem, but it ended up being a 1.5 hour ordeal to get the food, eat and gtfo!  Today, I asked for a booth for me and my wife to sit together and the host tried to sit us at a table.  I asked him for a booth when I saw three available and he told me he needed to clean them.  So I said okay, no problem...5 minutes goes by and nobody is doing anything.  Again, here I am on my lunch break.  I decided to just walk out and go to Burger King drive thru which gave me fantastic service.  This is about the 3rd time in 3 months this has happened at BWW and I'm done with this place.  This is sad too, because I really love the wings.  Don't come here if you value your time, because they sure as hell don't."}
{"text":"Really enjoy myself at during sporting events here! The food is not great but the atmosphere compensates for it. I have always had great service here and they always have some kind of great happy hour. My kids really enjoy it so its great to go as a family as well!!! They have tvs everywhere and you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is great. The issue is the cook is not consistent it is hit or miss. The chicken is either great or meh. The problem is it is not consistent."}
{"text":"My wife and I after 20 years of marriage love going out on a date. We are not materialistic so we don't like going to fancy places and dressing up. We are not about that whole \"act\" we are real people that like food and beverage and having fun! So, we went to buffalo Wild Wings this Saturday and the experience was awesome.   We had the chicken nachos, breaded mushrooms and the parmesan garlic wings and we had some beer that was a special spring training beer for the KC Royals fans which was a wheat beer. Fantastic beer...(Even though I am a Met fan).   Not only was the food and beverage very good, our waiter was a cool dude, the atmosphere there was exciting but most of all our date was great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"OMG - Yum Yum Yum!  Lets have a Bar B Que   This place is so cool and great sports atmosphere, ate there many times and again last night was AWESOME.  I had a Cheeseburger with bacon, fries, topped off with a Delicious Strawberry Margarita.  The staff is so professional, cool, and always making sure we are happy or need anything.  It's a awesome place to take the family, workout partners, team players, and buddies!  If you take your girlfriend there \"for a romance dinner\" you might get slapped LOL :)"}
{"text":"We ordered 3 kinds of wings and were told 25 minutes so we waited to go pick it up. Upon arriving we were then told that no one ever took our order that we didn't call we probably called a different one. The woman working knew she took our order and lied about it. Then the manager robin didn't even care and we had to wait another 20 min for our food to be done. We even proved that we called the same number we called at 11:15 and it was now 11:50... The same address and she had no idea. They just didn't want to take orders or something and we payed full price no sorry nothing I don't think I will be eating here again. Then we asked and paid for 2 ranch and got blue cheese worst experience ever. Whoever the manager at night is (Robin) should lay off the pills because she had no customer service at all!!! Kind of seemed like she was intoxicated Bad Experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go after a long days work of manuel labor at the old warehouse.  I visit here with my best friend and co-worker, Dan, a few times a week for the cheap beer specials and the excellent service.  My favorite bartender works here, Amanda, who is honestly more of a friend than a bartender.  Sometimes I could picture her hopping over the bar and sharing a few cold ones with me and my buddies.  It is your typical sports bar with great trivia and television screens galore.  However. the service keeps steady customers.  Come on by, and tip Amanda well."}
{"text":"Gotta give this place four stars for how they hooked me up last night.  I won a poker tournament back in January, and it was finally televised on some obscure channel on Dish/DirectTV.  Called a bunch of bars around town, and BWW was one of the few places that had it.  I rolled in with my friends at 10pm to watch, and they put the show on the big screen with the volume on for me.  On top of that, it was happy hour, so $3 beers and apps.  Sorry they were out of Jack Daniels, Mario.  Staff has always been super cool every time I've come here, so it's no surprise that they were so helpful.  Thanks, BWW!"}
{"text":"Top two sauces: Mango Habanero and Asian Zing.  It's BW3 because it used to be called \"Buffulo Wild West Wings\"."}
{"text":"Woah, for all you BW3 experts, Tuesday nights are now 45 cent wings. what the heck... I remember back when I first graduated college, they were 25 cent wings. It wasn't that long ago really! It's still a better deal than any other night of the week, so I'll still continue to go. 20 wings for $9 is still a decent deal. I don't eat 20 wings; I'm just calculating to put things into perspective for you all.  After going to this Robinson Town Center location, I still prefer the Monroeville locations. Both are slow, in terms of service, but the wings were actually better in Monroeville - plumper, juicier, and better sauced. This RTC location was pretty packed at 9pm, mostly filled with college students, probably looking for that good Wing Night deal.  As always, I'm a fan of BW3. My favorite sauces are Mango Habanero and Asian Zing. They are just the perfect blend of spicy, sweet, and salty flavors. Don't forget to lick your fingers afterwards - you paid good money for that extra sauce!"}
{"text":"I am here on business and got forced by hotel and weather to eat here two days in a row.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever eaten at - hands down.   Bad food, bad service.  Our dirty plates were never removed (we were here over 2 hours watching a hockey game).  The tables all around us were uncleared for over an hour after people were gone.  Abysmal experience- stay away!! I would give it zero stars if I could. Btw - game over and we are still waiting for our check......"}
{"text":"\"Can I put you on hold for one second?\"    30 minutes later nothing. Worst take out service I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Me and my cousins have been coming to this place for around 2 years. Never had an issue until tonight. Upon arriving we were told we had to play the slots if we wanted to stay at the bar. We each put 5 dollars in the machine and ordered all our food. We stayed the duration of the knights vs jets game along with everybody else around the bar. At the end the bartender doug was very rude. He told us that because he makes all his money on the slots and we played only 5 dollars we were not welcomed there anymore during the games and busy times. He also said that we laughed at the other bartender when she told us we had to play the slots which is a total lie. Mind you that nobody else was told they had to play to stay. Like I said, we've been coming here for 2 years to the point that they don't even check our ID at the bar because they know us. Regardless one bad experience changes everything and doug will get his wish as we will not be coming here anymore or any other location either."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, Jake and Bryan were attentive and great servers! Also appreciated the manager came over to check on food quality. A few Buffalo Wild Wings here in Vegas have been disappointing, but I will definitely be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"First time at the Sunridge location but I've been to the McLeod Trail location too many times to count. So I knew what to expect food wise, ambiance, etc. but here we had a really good server which can be hit or miss for the Dubs. She was really on top of things and patient with the little kiddies we had with our group.   Delicious wings as always."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places of wings always amazing to eat their !! The wings are perfect and they have 100 flavours of sauce and it's a great place to hang out !!"}
{"text":"Went with my family and we waited a few minutes and got the table and it was busy because it was a game night but it's a fun atmosphere and the stuff where very nice and the have tv everywhere and the food is always hot and fresh and good amount of sauce and they have good deals every week and you need to try the every sauce like they have 100 types from dry / wet sauce for boneless or bone and every Thursday the boneless wing is 75 cent each so that's a good deal and if you want to do a party or gathering with friends and they have a kids menu and you know can order from the app or website and pick up at the restaurant and on Tuesday, traditional wing for $0.75 cent each and they have cool beer selections and you need to try and they do family night from 4pm-8pm so I very highly recommend this restaurant for family and friends"}
{"text":"This place is full idiots. The service is horrible it's a shame this fucking place is still open. Servers are horrible. The runners dont know what food you ordered, its a shame. The food is disgusting the the traditional wings skin is like your chewing gum. I ordered a salad and they forgot to give me my silverware. I don't recommend wasting your money in this place. Fuck this place period! And its not the first time I've been here, i always have bad experiences. Today was my last."}
{"text":"Wings are great but the burgers need improvement I guess that's why it's called Buffalo Wild Wings not Buffalo Burger and Wings... Staff is always friendly and the food is always warm and tasty... Please get some real ketchup the one they have is watery I'm a Heinz guy myself... This location is very clean and that's impressive and important lots of TV to watch all the games and like I said staff is very attentive...  I will say I sit mostly at the bar when coming here so please take that into account..."}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 times , usually when I have a coupon. We have been with the kids (both teens) and we have never had a bad experience. They can be a little stingy with the sauces...like we all asked for ranch and was brought one little container...oh well.  Their wings are tasty and they have a good variety. I had a great time playing the trivia and totally kicked ass !!! I won a round and decided to stop while I was on top.   Everyone here has always been friendly and will definitely return ."}
{"text":"Saw two employees in the restroom come out of the same stall and not wash their hands. I let a manager know and one of the girls kept giving me dirty looks the rest of the time I was there. Service was also very slow and the happy hour mixed drinks were very weak."}
{"text":"It never ceases to amaze me how a restaurant  that all they do is wings, can suck at doing wings. They should have it down to a science. Forgot the fact that my tots were not on my plate, but fries were and then the tots were brought out at the end of my dinning experience! Why do you go to Buffalo Wild WINGS! FOR THE WINGS.  The wing were cold. And it wasn't like the were packed on a Friday night. No it was a Monday at 1:15pm.  There were only four parties in the entire restaurant! But when the word WING is in the name of the restaurant, at least don't sick at the wings. Then to just put some icing on the cake, it says 15 minutes or it is free. It take 17 mind the first time and another 17 minutes the second set of wings. My hour lunch brake turn into 2 and half hours mostly waiting on food or staff that was never around to get napkins, water or a check. They gave me a coupon for $5 off, yea... not worth it. That was my first and last time to this location and perhaps the last time to BWW. I will stick to Hooters!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Called to put wing order in for Super Bowl. Granted it's a busy day for them, but I was putting my order in FIVE AND A HALF HOURS before pickup. First I was told we could not pick up the order at 6:00 pm, only 5:45 or 6:15, which seems arbitrary and unusual considering the game starts at 6:30. Then, when I asked for the wings to be cooked well-done (which is standard as otherwise they are rubbery and cold) I was told they were not taking any special requests. OK, fine. Won't bother ever again. Remember folks -- you're a wing joint, nothing more. Get your act together."}
{"text":"I really like the food here! Their wings could stand to be coated in more sauce, though, as the sauce is pretty sparse and causes the wings to taste a bit dried out. My husband and I ordered takeout one night and the boxes of wings were given to us into a very small bag. As we were at the cash register, 1 boneless wing fell out of the box onto the counter due to the tiny bag it was in. I wish the cashier would have offered to replace it for us, but oh well. I would return here, always a good staple!"}
{"text":"Writing this review based on the many times I've been here. Today was probably the last straw and it called for the review. Service is slow here and I'm talking about dining in and picking up. Used the online ordering which said the order would be done at 7:30 pm. Ordered my food at around 7:00pm. Didn't get my order until 8:10pm. As far as dining in. Waited a while for food to get out and the waiters don't refill your drinks right away. Food is always good though. Service just take a while."}
{"text":"Great patio it was great to sit out there and watch the World Cup and drink a draft beer. The wings not my fav."}
{"text":"Was here only on Tuesday and Thursday....other days its costlier....shrimp is my favorite along with chicken.......loved the ambience the most.....best place to hangout with friends....great service.....there is waiting time which I dont like......"}
{"text":"Usually, a big fan of BWW - Service was incredibly slow  Literally waited almost an hour for dinner  Worst BWW I have ever been to.  Not sure how I did not post this review earlier :-("}
{"text":"Shouldn't the food you name your restaurant after actually taste good?   Why people go here for wings instead if Zipps or Half Moon is beyond me.  Only good thing about this place is that they have all the games on TV. Otherwise, food sucks."}
{"text":"Rant begin..... My husband and I went to Buffalo Wild Wings on McDowell and Dysart road to enjoy a few drinks and wings. Unfortunately 1/2 way through our dinner a mouse was roaming the restaurant near the kitchen and bar. We were disgusted along with multiple customers with the poor management led by Martin who did not acknowledge the issue and neglected to apologize for  the grotesque incident. He kept it hush hush... Not only did he not apologize, but he had the balls to try and inform us that the mouse couldn't enter the kitchen and there was no way our food was contaminated regardless of the swinging door from the dining area to the kitchen.... Does that make sense to anyone???? No!!!!! Our waitress understood our frustration and was very understanding and polite and apologized multiple times. The management at this facility should be reconsidered or should be put through the basic customer service training in which  most likely they give their new hires.... Rant over for now. #nevergoingback #disgusting"}
{"text":"I honestly love bdubs but I hate going on a busy night. We walked in Friday night and there was a huge line. The host/hostess didn't really look like they knew what they were doing and a ton of people hadn't been helped yet. We decided to sit outside because it was less crowded. Our waitress was really nice and took our order promptly. The food usually takes a long time to come out but that's at every BWW location. I never have any complaints about their wings. I really enjoy them and all the different flavors. I usually look forward to their monthly sauce. It took a while to get our waitress to give us our check. We were probably there for another 15-20 minutes after we were done eating waiting for her to come back. She kept passing us and helping other people. I sort of wish they had a self pay tablet like Applebee's and Chili's. It would make checkout much faster.  Side note: I've also ordered from this location to go and wasn't really impressed. The last time I did this, I waited  at the pickup counter for 15 minutes before being acknowledged by anyone and once I was, I was informed that there had been a mixup with my order and I had to wait an additional 15 minutes. I also don't understand why they charge you extra for dipping sauce when you order on the app but it's free in the restaurant. They gave me free sauce anyway for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I usually love buffalo, but this one made me lose faith. First, there was no host to greet us or to seat us (no biggie right?) so we decided to sit in the bar area to make it easier on everyone. We sat for a few minutes and figured they were busy so we just got menus from the bar to start the process hoping they'd see us, but Servers passed and no assistance was offered. Eventually, we left and went next door BJ's; I definitely would not recommend this location unless you want to be ignored and waste your time."}
{"text":"Food was on point. Absolutely delicious. The service left something to be desired. 1 drink refill during an entire hour spent waiting. Food took about 45 minutes to be brought out after ordered. I don't know if it was the waitresses fault or if that is just how the restaurant operates, however I will not be returning to this location ever again based on the service."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. If you order online, expect to wait 30 or more mins past your pick uptime for food. Don't be surprised that when you get home with your food after waiting way way too long for it, your order is wrong. Seriously disappointed. Every time we order to go, it's always late!! Get it together!!"}
{"text":"Pro: Very nice location and has the appeal that most of the BWW establishments have. The food is fine and I enjoy the people who come to eat.   Con: No matter where I go: Florida, Illinois, Wisconsin, etc. The service is terrible. Almost every waitress I get can not get the job right. You are suppose to come back for refills and to deliver the food at some point. Lets just say the service was bad here, too. I will BBW was self-service. Otherwise, everything is great."}
{"text":"We came here cause we were hungry and wanted some wings. I walked in and we were seated pretty fast (party of 3) and our drinks were taken right away. The TVs are way too loud and you have to yell to order. We've been here for 30 mins and barely got our meal order taken and still haven't received our appetizer we ordered when we ordered drinks. So hungry and disappointed :("}
{"text":"Out of all the Buffalo Wild Wings I have gone too in town, The Warm Springs Location Definitely has the best Vegas Hospitality! I usually sit at the Bar, Shane The Bartender is Great at his Job. Im never waiting around for another Drink, and My food is always out hot and fast!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was prompt with everything and made sure we were taken care of. Which is surprising because this BWW is only a couple months old. The bartender Jake was awesome too and really friendly."}
{"text":"This was my first time in a BWW. The only one near my house is way too far away so I was kinda excited when I discovered this one in Vegas. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and seated within 2 minutes. Our waitress was super chill- even asked if it was our first time, suggested some flavors for the wings too. There was also a girl who came by and offered samples of sauces so we could decide without guessing which is good or not. This definitely helped. I'm a fan of crispy wings and was stoked when they came out as such. I'm most def a fan of BWW now."}
{"text":"Our server this past visit was AWESOME! so friendly happy and seemed as though he enjoyed his job. Unlike a young gal who seemed somewhat bi-polar, when asking for cheese with the fries. Well!! we went on a Friday night before going bowling.. ohh yeah!  BUSY it was very busy!  wait was about 35 minutes for a clean table.  A few games were going on the large tv screens and the bar was full!    I don't remember our servers name.. but he checked back frequently to see that everything was okay. if we needed anything else. refilled our cups.   and.. as we were ordering combined the wings into a larger order, as opposed to three small orders and made it cheaper for us.  NOW that is a NICE man. :D    just saying he got a good tip.  nice and close to the mall if you don't fancy food court food."}
{"text":"Great food but service needs to be attentive more since it gets crowded but great place for  sports tv"}
{"text":"We were here with a group of friends on Tuesday. Ordered 2 large and 1 medium wings. They didn't inform the customer that they are not doing the Wing Tuesday special anymore. I spoke with the manager, and they told us they stop doing the traditional wing Tuesday special 2 months ago. Just be aware of the Tuesday special isn't available anymore. I just don't understand why they don't inform customers who orders wings before they place the order in..."}
{"text":"Carlie was excellent her service was above and beyond expectation the front staff that got us a great table Robert was amazing in assisting us with any issues that we had and Jesse was just as good"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we love Buffalo Wild Wings, and we came there with huge party of people and spent a lot of money tonight.Manager DANNY, from bbw very much humiliated us. Especially the other manager. We had spoken to them about an issue with the bartender, because he referred to us as \"stupid\" because we laughed when he left the beer running. As we spoke to the other manager he said he would take care of it, and another employee followed us out the door, and harassed us. My boyfriend spoke with him in a decent manner and for some reason he got offended and said \"all of us white people look the same to you now\" as I was trying to speak with the man his manager came out of the corner and began to kick us out stating \"you are not my customers you need to leave\" without even asking about the situation or Trying to solve the issue. Instead we were kicked out in front of everyone at BUFFALO WILD WINGS IN LAS VEGAS near aria hotel. I'm humiliated and should not have been treated in this matter. On top of that as we were trying to clarify, the manager in the video states \"what's are you gonna do about it your in VEGAS\" @bwwings I will not return to that location, is this the way you treat your customers BWW? I'd like a response. In my years of working hospitality, this was not right for your workers that are the \" face of your company\" to speak to us. He threatened us by saying security will come and take care of us, and said that we don't know how to Treat workers. First of all my sister is security, and knows there are lines that should not be crossed. Second her wife is a server so we treat all with respect whether they're working as servers or not, and on top of that I specialize in hospitality and am very clerical so he had no reason to argue and say we don't know how to treat people when all we do is work with people and the public for a living. This is going to corporate. Because I'm sure by the way they were acting and saying those inappropriate things, they treat all of their customers like that. We were disrespected to the highest extent and I am ashamed. Miracle Mile Shops, 3663 S Las Vegas Blvd #600, Las Vegas, NV 89109 BEWARE OF THIS PROPERTY"}
{"text":"Came this time with my mid-kid & we had a really great time! Quick service & yummy food & drinks- we'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the fight and all seats gone but they weren't tripping as they got me a drink to stand and was ch the fight and I placed an order later. Location was packed inside and parking lot packed outside. Good location for beer food and sports so it's all good."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst service experiences I have had. We came here for lunch and wanted something quick before hitting the road to visit some of the areas outside Vegas.  It took our server 3 trys to get our drink order correct (an orange juice and lemonade, nothing too complicated). They brought the wrong appetizer to the table, took that away then took another 20-minutes to get the right one to us. Then brought the wrong entrees, and again took another 20-minutes after those were taken away before getting our food. Never got our drinks refilled during the whole time we were there.  Overall the whole staffed behaved like it was their first day. Running around like chickens with their heads cut off, going from table to table with an order of food until they hit the right one. It is obvious there is a lack of leadership and guidance from the management of this location. This is an example of not training the staff and letting their shifts just be a good time for them and requiring little to no discipline from a lazy manager. Either that or the management here has absolutely no idea how to run a restaurant.  I highly recommend avoiding this location. They are lucky to be on the main road into the strip, so they can survive with little to no repeat business, because i cannot imagine anyone coming here would come again."}
{"text":"To be honest, we never had an issue before this evening. Service is generally good, and food is what is to be expected from a Buffalo Wild Wings.   However, tonight was my birthday. There were just two of us at the table. We ordered a pretzel appetizer. I ordered a buffalo ranch chicken wrap, and my husband a medium order of wings with 3 flavors.   The waitress repeated the whole order back correctly. A food runner brought the wrong wings for my husband (someone else's order). The waitress apologized and let us know it would be another 20 min for wings, because the kitchen was slammed.  The waitress was not at fault, but I find this to be unacceptable. The result was we cancelled his order, and paid for my food and the appetizer. It was a bummer they were not willing to rush his order, or comp the appetizer, or offer a dessert. The manager (gave the waitress to give to us) coupons for a snack size wings, but never came over to the table. Oh well! We tipped the waitress more than 20% and wrote on the receipt that the food runner and kitchen need work.   We will be back I'm sure, but the expectation is 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"Rarely am I disappointed with BW3, but service wasn't good and I know restaurants get short handed due to staffing, and what not so I try to give them the benefit of doubt. But one of the seven guys didn't get asked what he wanted to eat so they gave him coupons for his next trip there, that's how bad it was. I just had water and ran out for 10 minutes or more twice and had to track down another waitress. The waitress was young and maybe new, so again I'll give her a pass. They place was NOT busy though.   The food: I got the buffalo chicken salad, where was the protein in this salad. Everything I was hoping was chicken was actually croutons. So I thought for a second I got a house salad, wrong, I finally found chicken. The chicken was minimal and the salad had way more huge piece lbs of tomato and croutons than it did chicken, yet chicken is in the name!   I will probably be back, more often than not they're good. I have the waitress a $6 tip on a $12 ticket, hoping she will improve. I'm sure it's not a job for everyone, I've never done it and respect the good servers"}
{"text":"On February 23, 2018, my family and I attended the Dodgers SpringTraining in the City Glendale. We decided eat at the BWW, which is located at the Westgate mall.  We were told that the wait was approximately an hour and we decided to wait. My three buddies and I decided to walk over to the bar to kill time. Wearing our Dodgers gear, we sat at the bar. No one acknowledged us for a good five to ten minutes. After ordering our drinks, the bartenders purposely ignored us. They attended to the other customers and never turned our way. My buddy finally got one of the bartenders attention and ordered a drink. She placed the drink in front of him, turned around and walked away. She never asked the other three of us with empty glasses if we would like a drink. We literally had to flag her down one by one and order our drinks separately. It was obviously and apparent that she did not want to serve us. There was a total of three bartenders and none of them would attend to us. I have to say that this experience completely changed my view of BWW."}
{"text":"Every time I come here they get my order wrong.  And on top of that they take forever to get you anything. Want an extra side of ranch? 30 minutes."}

{"text":"Nothing bad to say! Kevin our sever was friendly, Attentive and funny. We ordered 1lb of parm & garlic and 1lb of hot wings...both were great. Oh and we shared a basket of sweet potato fries.  Look the menu is simple so the service better be top notch...and it was."}
{"text":"In a word disappointing.  Overpriced and slow.  9 pm at nigt and not a lot of people here.  We won't be back.  We were charged for celery and ranch and the menu said there was no charge."}
{"text":"Our server, Vince was great!  Friendly, fast, and got things right.  We did not have to wait for a table, but did end up under an enthusiastic air vent.  Vince moved us to another table immediately.  We had a great experience!  And, of course, the wings were perfect."}
{"text":"Cody the \"captain\" was amazing and on point with everything and truly went above and beyond with his job. I wish he was our server. The server Melinda was not on point and we were constantly having to ask for everything. She was a nice girl, but I feel Cody did more for my group."}
{"text":"You cant go wrong with salt and vinegar wings, a cold beer and a good game. This is one of the hubs favorite places to go and I thoroughly enjoy myself as well. I was amazed by the quality of the salad I ordered. I expected your typical run of the mill restaurant side salad - iceberg lettuce, some onions and ranch. But this was amazing. There was a variety of greens and even some extra veggies tossed in. Love it."}

{"text":"Once again i do not usually write reviews. But given my past bad experience with a establishment by my home i wont name any names but dunkin donuts HORRIBLE. And after that to get such a great customer service experience over the phone i was not even physically at buffalo wild wings and by far got the best customer service ever! By JENNY LYNN i specifically asked for her to clarify her name because she deserves 10+ stars for her customer service and should be recognized. As to the food always prepared right. Always tasty , as to waiting and time frame this location is usually always busy and is not necessarily a \"fast food\" joint, and i do try to always plan ahead of time as you would say and if they are to busy , i go sit at the bar and they always try to provide the best service they can. No one can be perfect but imagine i took the time out of my \"relaxing time\" to write a reviw about people i dont even know that should say something.  JENNY LYNN great job! And just in case there is another Jenny Lynn at buffalo wild wings at durango. The Jenny Lynn that was working up front answering phones on the evening of 12/20/2016 in the evening time. Happy holidays and happy new year !"}
{"text":"I found it ok.  Their wings are decent (they are on the smaller side as Phil W. noted).  I however found them tasty.  They also didn't make me feel sick after like the other \"Wild Wing\" wings always do.. LOL.  Atmosphere was ok - for what the place is.  Don't get me wrong, it's a loud, obnoxious sports bar atmosphere.... BUT, it was clean, and had friendly/prompt service (neither of which you usually get in such establishments).  in the end, I'd go back.  Especially to have some wings, a pint, and watch the game.  it's nice to see something NEW coming to the area, rather than just the usual garbage chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Medium wings have definitely changed, the size of wings are better and the service is awesome! Been to this location at least 3 times so they are always consistent."}
{"text":"I was to this outlet many years ago and was somewhat disappointed to be eating out of a paper lined, plastic basket.  My friends Amelinda L. clued me into their boneless wings Thursday special and I decided to do take out last night.  Boneless wings are $.60 each on Thursdays.  It's only about 3 miles, so it's not a drive for me to go here.  I din't order online or phone my order in.  When I got there, the young woman at the register walked me through the process and answered my questions.  A minimum of 4 wings per flavor must be ordered.  I ended up getting 6 spicy garlic for my wife and 6 of the classic hot for myself.  I also ordered a basket of fries which she assured me was great for two people sharing.  She was correct!  The cashier told me it would be 10 to 15 minutes.  I started to play Angry Birds and before I could swear twice, the order was ready.  It was probably 5 minutes maximum.  I brought the order home and we dug in.  I was so hungry that I forgot to take a photo of the food.  Next time.  The wings were very good and the sauces were just right.  There was a nice bite to my lips from the hot sauce.  The fries ameliorated that heat a bit and I had a nice mug of iced tea at hand.  I am a fan and I think I'll come back here on a Thursday again.  For less than $14, dinner for 2.  Not bad at all.  And tasty dinner for two.  And, I didn't have to cook!  Amelinda L, thanks once again!"}
{"text":"It's got \"Wings\" in the title, so why are the wings not a knockout?  If you've never been to BW3s, it's visual overload.  TVs and gaming (electronic poker, trivia, etc) is in every corner.  Wings are now in \"Small, Medium, Large\" rather than the old system where it told you a number of wings you get.  You don't really have a way to judge how big a \"large\" order will be before you get it.  My main complaint is that the wings are not 100% perfect.  You get some that are good and some that are a little flabby.  Other menu items aren't of note either (appetizers and burgers).  And definitely avoid if you are a vegetarian unless you just order fries.  The other amusing thing is their beer list.  The menu very purposely avoids listing prices for drink. When you order a beer, you're asked \"Small or \"Large\"?  The small is a pint glass and the large is a pilsner glass. If I go again, I want to do an experiment with teh glasses.  The pilsner probably only holds a few more ounces than the small, as the pilsner is taller but has a thick base and is thinner as well.   There are so many restaurants in Madison where you can order wings, drink beer, and watch sports. I can't say that BW3s is even close to the top."}
{"text":"No puedo creer q el servicio sea tan malo en este lugar, y bueno lo mismo pienso de las alitas, la vdd es q las alitas congeladas de los súper mercados son mejores, no vuelvo a regresar"}
{"text":"Owners also own location on Gilbert road which seems to get more attention.  Service at bar area is good, but table service is hit or miss.  Not sure why you can't order a dozen wings anymore - when did it become 10?      Rumours that they are closing this location."}
{"text":"They allow the Mom's to bring their kids to the bar???? I guess if you say something it would be worse, smh."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner Friday night..the Rocky River location is the best I have had...Chelsea was our server and she was spot on with everything..we loved her!"}
{"text":"In college, we often visited the BW-3 (I am so old school, I remember what the last W stood for-Weck) on State St.  We would drink our beer, play trivia, and eat wings. Life was simple.   I was a fan. Now, after 20 years, not so much.  Yes, I appreciate all the TVs in the place and sitting in the bar area guarantees that you will never miss a play but that is about it. The beer offerings are commercial and boring. It is laughable that they consider Leinie's Honey Weiss a microbrew, The wings are fine but I find they are getting smaller and smaller.  The sauces are fine.  The rest of the food is your basic \"Open up a Sysco product and pour out the food\" variety.  Overall, just myeah....pretty underwhelming. Service is friendly and usually pretty efficient. I will comment that I find this location brings out the d-bag factor more than other locations.  If you are 40, it is time for you to stop wearing your hat backwards.  Yes, you and 90% of the world's population are wearing a black North Face jacket.  You are neither cool nor trendy.....just stop trying so damn hard..."}
{"text":"As my husband so accurately put it while we shared a drink on the crappy patio, \"I've seen better ambience in a Chuck E. Cheese.\""}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times in the last month or so to watch OSU games and Buffalo Wild Wings has been pretty good for it. They have plenty of TVs and the food isn't bad either. I haven't had any problems with this location."}
{"text":"This location is always so unorganized! Everyone seems like they're in a bad mood and like they don't want to even work there. I was waiting for a to go order for over 10 mins and one of the workers kept coming to the register but wasn't even acknowledging the line there was. She wouldn't even say a word. There was the female manager on the floor but she couldn't seem to keep the restaurant together. It wasn't even that busy to begin with. Overall good wings but terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this is one of our favorites. This location is clean and the staff has always been extremely friendly. I love the snack size boneless wings with Asian zing and hot bbq (garlic parm is always a fav, too). My husband enjoys the bone in wings and loves how they over do it on the sauce. I do think they have raised the prices of the wings recently but during happy hour you can get some reasonably priced appetizers and the beer always seems to go down smoothly :)."}
{"text":"This place is decent.  I like the atmosphere OK, the wait staff is friendly enough, and the food is decent.    I've had a few different things off the menu and there was nothing was memorable other than the wings.  The wings are good, but not great.  They don't overcook them and they are a good size yet even with all the flavors they lack one that I HAVE to go back and eat.  I also think they could add a couple more micro brews into their beer selection and considering they don't have happy hour, it isn't cheap to go for a round of beers and some wings."}
{"text":"Did a online order and picked it up I had asked for a additional side of sauce but didn't get it however they did grab it right away and took care of the situation. Food was ready right when they said it would be and got in and out right away! Friendly staff and great atmosphere if your into sports and damn good chicken!"}
{"text":"We dont eat at BWW too often, but we usually have a good experience, and this was no exception.  I happen to love BWW, but my husband, not so much, so when he suggested we eat there for dinner one night I was like \"HURRY BEFORE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND!\" :)    Anyway, our server was totally on point.  She had a really friendly, outgoing personality and her service was awesome.  My husband and I were both impressed with her.  There was also a guy going around running drinks, offering samples, etc.. I forget what he told us his title was but he got us to sign up for there emails and he did a really good job suggesting different drinks and helping us out.  At first we were a little confused because he brought the first beer sample to our table and we assumed he was the bartender because he asked us if we wanted to try something else, and when he brought THAT sample, we told him which we preferred and he told us we had to tell our server, which we didnt understand at first, but then he continued to tell us what his job was there.  OK, but maybe still just go tell our server.. it just made for a confusing, awkward 30 seconds or so.  Regardless, we finally got it and he was a really nice, helpful guy.    Our food was, in my opinion, awesome as always.  I almost always get the 10 boneless wings with 2 different sauces, celery and carrots.. pretty basic and I dont go crazy with new sauces.  In that aspect, I'm a creature of habit.. I know what I like! The hubs got whatever sandwhich they were featuring and he wasnt INLOVE with it, but then, he's hard to impress.  He liked it enough not to complain and he wasn't upset, he just wont be ordering it next time we eat there (Lord willing, haha)."}
{"text":"Service is trouble! Took 35 minutes for a side salad and 20 minutes to get a fork to eat! They can't handle a crowd at all!"}
{"text":"Try the reverse happy hour.  Great drink specials and appetizers are half off.  Monday through Friday 10 PM to 6 AM.  The wings are consistent but the chili con Queso is awesome."}
{"text":"first - they sat us next to a window. IDK why restaurants in AZ even have windows, it was hot AF. so we asked to move within the first 5 mins. they moved us and we waited at least another 10 minutes to place a drink order. in AZ, i dont want to wait 10 minutes for water, i'm already dying from heat stroke. the frustrating part was that the \"manager\" was standing right outside the kitchen \"watching\" the scene and didn't notice we had nothing on our table for 10 mins or that the table next to us hadn't been cleared in the same amount of time! ew. anyways, its a bdubs: u get drinks, u get wings, there's a zillion tvs to watch. it is what it is at this place."}
{"text":"I've never been to one of these before, mostly because I hate chains and buffalo wings do not interest me.  But this joint has a bajillion TVs and we wanted to watch a college football game.  I told the hostess that we had a party of four and wanted to see the Northwestern-Iowa game (one of the minor games in the time slot), and she made a beeline for a particular table which suited us very well.    We had just come from a late breakfast, so we didn't eat, but instead ordered just beer for the duration of the game.  Our server was attentive and friendly though.  No complaints."}
{"text":"I thought I knew what pain and loss was,but then I ate at Buffalo Wing Wings off Cedar and it destroyed my life.  Their food ripped out my colon, gave me cancer, destroyed my marriage, and got me fired from my job.  Now Im homeless and lonely.  Thanks Buffalo Wild Wings!"}
{"text":"Best place in the neighborhood, surprisingly good! Great service, clean place, tons of wing sauces, and NON breaded wings which is how wings should be."}
{"text":"This is the best Buffalo Wild Wings I've ever been to!  We went on a Sunday afternoon for football, right before the Cardinals game. Now, anytime I've done this before at a different BDubs, I always end up regretting not getting there sooner because it's so full! But this place is like an undiscovered gem - there were actual open tables!  The service was par for Buffalo Wild Wings: nothing special but not disappointing.  The food was also par: great!  Go here for the football games before people discover it!"}
{"text":"You gotta hand it to Buffalo Wild Wings: they are the place to go for football on a Sunday. With TVs lining the walls, you are definitely going to find the game you came in for. It should be noted that Sundays are PACKED - get there a half hour before your game is going to start. And if your game is at the same time as the Cardinals game, you may be sitting outside. Don't worry, they've got heaters in the winter and sprinklers in the summer for their patio :)  I like the layout of Tempe's Buffalo Wild Wings. The environment is always clean and the waitstaff is always very helpful. Being at a bar for 3+ hours can be a challenge for any waiter and these folks do it well. Our orders are always correct, our beers are always refilled in a timely manner, and they're always smiling and happy.  If you need a place to watch the game, go here! You'll love the wings, the beer, and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the spicey buffalo wing challenge! Only one yelper was brave enough to take on the challenge: My T and he completely owned it! Congratualtions!  As for the restaurant, \"ehhh,\" is about all I can say. I am not a huge fan of buffalo wings to begin with. We came during happy hour, so .45 cent wings, food and drink specials were great. Multiple wing sauces also kept things interesting. But, beyond that, there was nothing specal about this, or any other Buffalo Wild Wings (I asuume). A large bar area (equal in size to the dining area) with multiple prejection tvs airing ESPN 1 through infinity, trivia games running on smaller tvs. All the stereotypical sports bar accrutrements.  Our server I think was overwhelmed, it could have been quicker and friendlier. She was nice and efficient enough to split the check up for us, so that was a plus!"}
{"text":"First time going to this location with my husband and we loved it. We went straight to the bar area and didn't have to wait for seating. We had a nice server and she was helpful. The food was bomb(compared to the location in L.A. ). We ordered mozzarella sticks, fried mushrooms (boooooomb) and combo wing platters. The Caribbean Jerk was good and definitely has a lot of kick to it!!! Great first time experience and will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The closer you look at BWW, the better you understand how are run here, at least I know it. People may see Buffalo Wild Wing as not so good because of their first impression, well, I guess not because the more I eat here, the more I realize how delicious their wings are. The people were also very wonderful, they this good attitude, they keep this formal tone when talking to their customers. I also love the dining area that has this good atmosphere. Overall, this a good place to eat wings."}
{"text":"I LOVE CHICKEN WINGS!! My fave is parmesan-garlic!!"}
{"text":"BWW you get wings and you're happy!! great for watching sports. i get the parm-garlic and salt vinegar traditional wings. RANCH!! love this place."}
{"text":"I should have ordered just the beer.  I know thats good.  Instead I ordered a salad.   Gross--the lettuce looked like it was last weeks lettuce.   The chicken on it tasted like imitation.  My husband ordered the steak wrap which tasted like cheap parts is parts meat.   My daughter ordered  the boneless wings.  Those were over cooked and dry,"}
{"text":"This location is horrible service is bad food is bad food was cold they had 4 tables and took 1 hour to get our food I will never go to another buffalo wild wings"}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Buffalo Wild Wings and most of the time when I go, I sit at the bar play video poker, order food and a beer.  When I went to this location 7345 S Durango Dr on Black Friday I ordered food and 1 beer while playing video poker for about 30-40 minutes.  After finishing I cashed out, losing $5 out of $20. Also, during that time I was up to $32.   When I got the bill the beer was on the receipt, I asked the bartender isn't the drink comp'd because I was playing?  She stayed that you have to play $20 to get a comp, I said I did play $20.  She said that you have to lose the whole $20 to get a comp.  I told her that have never heard that from a Buffalo Wild Wings in Las Vegas before. She said that since the restaurant went corporate 10 years ago it's always been that way.   So Why don't they state on the machine: play & lose $20 to get a comp drink??   The bartender did take the beer off the receipt and I paid for my food.  Just wondering has anyone else been told this at BWW?"}
{"text":"I really do not know why, but all of a sudden my six year-old daughter has a hankering for chicken wings.  What better place to bring her to than BWW.  We went yesterday during the crazy storm that rolled in here in Las Vegas.  We ordered sliders and fries, mac and cheese, and 15 boneless buffalo wings with the medium sauce and plain for the kids.  My kids ate everything and really enjoyed their food; I enjoyed the wings and beer.  We also watched the US vs Panama in the Gold Cup final; my daughters were into the game because everyone else was.  All in all a great experience; my kids are asking to go back already."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Buffalo Wild Wings, and they do a good job of keeping the experience consistent. This location specifically, is about as average as they come. The food, is consistent, the restaurant is pretty clean, and the service is ok.  I work near the restaurant, so my co-workers and I visit about twice a month. More out of convenience than anything else at this point. The servers arent very attentive, nor have great attitudes. The whole experience is just kinda, meh. Deserving of 3 stars.  If you are looking for a place with above average wings, with average service, but alot of TVs to watch the game or fight, its the perfect place."}
{"text":"Was here for a Bachelor Party and watched a UFC PPV with NO COVER! It was busy, yes, but the service was very fast and I can say with out a doubt that our waiter was one of the best servers I've ever had. Your not doing yourself any favors if you don't stop by here if your in Tempe"}
{"text":"Way to many waitresses with food service  pathetically slow. It looks like the manager is bored. He doesn't appear to do much to make this place a good experience for customers.  Looks like they need a new manager.   Maybe they should improve food delivery speed. I doubt they will. It's always slow here.  It's  just not worth it given how expensive this place is now.  I used to love Buffalo wild wings but this place and service and value proposition is not competitive and frankly a joke.  Finally the boneless wings are nearly chickenless chicken wings as well.  Lightly breaded? They were like 20-30% breaded omg.  The  only reason I came back is because I had an oil change nearby and they were the best option within walking distance.  Oh well.  Customers will drive on by when they can. Lol"}
{"text":"Worse worse customer service. An older man that's a manager was so rude to our table. They really need to fire him. He lacks in customer service. Our waiter kept forgiving to give us our drinks. Our wings were dry and cold. We spend too much money there for them to treat us like that. Please do not spend your money there."}
{"text":"Usually good food, but not on the night shift. Its hard to get them to ever answer the phone.  One night we just drove up there after trying to call in an order for about 20 minutes. My husband went inside and sat at the bar for 10 minutes before he was even acknowledged (only about 6-7 people in the place). He placed the order, got it in a timely manner and we came home. Only to find that my wings were over cooked and dry, fried pickels were more like the crumbs from the bottom of the fry basket and the salsa bowl was only half full. $50 worth of disappointment. The next day i called the manager. He did offer me a food credit but what was upsetting was his remark, \"You cant alway know how busy a place really is.\" Busy or not you should answer your phone, acknowledge your customers and prepare what is already over priced food correctly."}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (37 of 365). I have a lot of catching up to do!  Great establishment.  1 star = for the massive number of TVs they have in the bar, including some huge displays for the big games of the day.  They are willing to seat you near the TV that is playing the game you are interesting in watching.  They are also willing to change the channel for you if the current ones playing aren't of interest.  2 stars = for their selection of drinks.  They offered us green colored beer on St. Patty's day too!  3 stars = for the food!  Besides their wings, they offer quite a selection.  All of their appetizers are awesome.  Make sure to have their soft pretzels; the cheese sauce is amazing and has kind of a curry or cumin kick to it.  Their sliders are huge, and their pita chips w/ spinach dip are yummers!  4 stars = duh! for their wings.  Order them naked so you can try more than one type of dipping sauce; they have lots.  Garlic Parmesan is one of my favorites.  5 stars = for having games to play at your table.  They have trivia to play against other people at the bar as well.  Thumbs up if you want to watch a game and eat good food!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to try a Buffalo Wild Wings but for the longest time, there wasn't one close to where I live.  So...when we were in Mesa last week, we seized the opportunity to try it.  I had heard good things about Buffalo Wild Wings thus I was looking forward to trying it.  So, sadly, I must say that I was disappointed.  I ordered the spicy garlic wings but what I got looked and tasted like ordinary buffalo wings.  They had no garlic flavor what so ever.  It's a good thing I only ordered 6 wings!  My husband, who isn't a fan of wings, tried their burger and pronounced it to be *meh*---pretty forgettable.  After reading the reviews here, I'm glad we went for an early dinner.  When we went on a weeknight, we were the first dinner customers of the evening.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Still...if I hear that my experience wasn't par for the course, I would be willing to try it again, but not in this location!"}
{"text":"I called to place an order today, I decided not to. The feminine male employee that answered the phone was very rude. Management, please send him to a customer service class or something."}
{"text":"I have had really nice and amazing experiences at this location. I hate to write something negative because I love this place, but tonight was horrible. I was treated by this really rude and disrespectful lady named Amber. She was very rude and it put me in a very bad mood the whole night. Great place, bad Amber."}
{"text":"For the last three years me and my friends would come down to this BWW location and do our fantasy football drafts!  And the service continues to be excellent!  I usually order 18 regular wings but different sauces per 6.  For some reason I love their asian zing!  But on days where I'm not rolling in 15+ deep, ordering tons of wings and beer (which guarantees gratuity) the service still is excellent.  Maybe I'm distracted by all the sports on the numerous tvs mounted everywhere or the trivia they have.  If I have room, I love their onion rings with that sauce thing they have.  Mmmmm.  I'm not a regular enough to know what special nights they have or what their happy hour times are but this place is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun, good food and great place! The waitress was outstanding service kept drinks full ask if we needed anythimg else. Food oder was correct and the bill was correct also no discrepency. Will be back had a super time."}
{"text":"At 4:15pm the dining room is empty and I am promptly seated.  Table was dirty. Mistakes happen so no problem I moved to next table - dirty. Then I moved to 3rd table and it is sticky. I asked server if she thought it sticky but she hesitated to touch it. She agreed and asked me if I wanted her to clean it. No thanks. Three dirty tables in a row. I am out of here."}
{"text":"Went to Buffalo Wild Wings because we had a gift card to use.  Normally I'm not much of a wing guy but I do like Wing Stop so I figure, why not?  What do we have to lose?  Quite a bit actually.  No offense to the service here.  Our waitress was prompt, very polite, and kept a good check on us.  But the food?  Eh, not my favorite for wings or bar type food.  For a chain I guess I should have been held to the 'average to maybe above average' experience.    Was I mistaken to think the wings here at Buffalo Wild Wings should be bigger?  Damn, these wings were small!  An order of six could barely feed my 12 year old kid!  We got her a kid's meal as well.  Luckily we had our gift card which did cover most of the bill, but still we had to order quite a bit of food to lose our hunger.  We started off with the 'Ultimate' Nachos.  I put ultimate in quote because they really weren't at all.  Basic dish of nachos with chili, pico de gallo, jalapenos, cheese, and salsa all on a bed of tortilla chips.  But...who puts shredded lettuce on hot nachos?  Thing was all soggy upon arrival to our table.  Serving was ok but barely enough for three of us to share.  For wings, we got traditional in the medium size (about 15-16 wings) in three flavors: Mild, Lemon Pepper, and Asian Zing.  Our wings also came with sides of carrot and celery sticks, and blue cheese dressing.  The wings?  Bit of a disappointment to say the least!  So tiny!  Looks like it was meant for kids to nosh on.  After two little bites one wing was gone.  Flavors weren't my favorite either.  The Mild?  Basic Buffalo with less kick.  Lemon Pepper?  Dry, dry, dry!  Where is the butter for this?  Like they took fried wings and just dressed it with lemon pepper without anything to make them stick to the wings.  Asian Zing?  Just damn basic sweet chili sauce on wings.  Bleh.  Kid got a meal of boneless wings in Parmesan Garlic flavor.  She was disappointed as well unfortunately.  The boneless wings were dry.  There was nothing on them to really hold the parmesan garlic flavor in.  Once again, a dip in butter would have helped.  She ended up not eating most of them.    We've gone to that 'other' wing place (*cough* Wing Stop *cough*) a number of times and much prefer them I'm sorry to say.  The wings were much more substantial, and the flavorings were much more on par with being tasty.  Pricing was a bit better as well since it provided more value.  Sorry Buffalo Wild Wings, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"They would not accept my yelp offer... Because they are a franchise.. I love Naima she's funny and has great humor. since my friends and I are servers it's nice to have someone who remembers us and treats us like we're friends :)"}
{"text":"Food is just OK here. I have to say I was rather disappointed my the spicy garlic sauce. What I was expecting was garlicy (white as most garlic sauces are) with some kick. What we received was some garlicky buffalo sauce. Perfect for the boyfriend though. I know better for the future!  I like they can be flexible with the drinks. I like to get one of their non-alcoholic specialty drinks and then adding vodka to it. Works great.  I go here to watch the UFC fights or to just chill and have a few drinks. A great place to watch the fights. Great sound and it's on a lot of screens. They did a great job of serving our very large party together one evening. Waitress was great handling the different orders throughout the evening. It gets really crowded so you have to get there early. There were people who just ended up standing the whole evening. But everyone seemed to be having a good time."}
{"text":"Over-priced and overrated. Somewhere along the way, this chain started prioritizing the gimmick over the food."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great Bloody Mary's, Wings, and watching football."}
{"text":"Came here last night for some March Madness action.  It was my first time at the new location across 22 from Penn Center East.  Although it was extremely busy, we had excellent service by our waitress.  Got the hot boneless wings, and holy crap were they hot.  They were so hot in fact, I couldn't finish them really.  That's rare in my book, as I love spicy.  Mind you, I did have a dinner before I came here for a late night... so that could be a factor.  Overall, great BWs and I will be back."}
{"text":"My review is mixed at all times about BW3s. The wings are by no means the best in the world, but going on Wing Tuesdays increase their desirability."}
{"text":"Tuesday Wing Nights are the reason to go.  Dry Rub Buffalo is great."}
{"text":"Best location in town! :)"}
{"text":"Lets start with the good........their wings are really good and  large in size. Tv's everywhere ........  The bad...... This location has a few antiquated projection screen tv's that make what you're watching look like a 1975 tv. please upgrade !! Wings are now 1.10 each.....man oh man....when did wings get so crazy expensive?? A dozen wings.... 13.00 ???  15 wings 16.00 ? They have so many specials that the waiter couldn't even figure them out..... Special Calendars, drink specials, happy hour only at the bar.......we were frazzled just trying to get past the rules.   Again , loved the asian wings, my jerk chicken sandwich was ok......"}
{"text":"The environment was awesome, everything else was extremely average and bland. The wings, which I'm assuming are among the main attractions, were average at best. I've had blatantly better from pizza places I order from. But they weren't bad. Same goes for the mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and fries. Generally just something to keep you alive while the game is on."}
{"text":"every time my friends an I come to this place we always get forgotten about. We always have to wait so long to order our food and then wait some more to get our food at the table. I love this place and it's hard to leave a bad review but wish the service here was much faster."}
{"text":"If there was Zero Stars I would give this location that grade. We have been here five different times, and never once had good service. Today, we went in after my girlfriend got off work, and waited for six to seven minutes without anyone even acknowledging us in a completely empty restaurant. Several servers walked by, and did not even bother to look at us. When a server. I am used to Buffalo Wild Wings being a very positive experience. It is my favorite restaurant. I will gladly drive out of my way from now on to avoid this location."}
{"text":"Shayan was super accommodating I asked for the Mexico vs Panama game yesterday and he rushed to put the game on from what I understood it was he's first week there or something however the service he gave me and my GF was that of an expert I really want to give this guy a shout out for giving us 5 star service as well as women that was training him she was also super nice and sweet i always come to this location for pick up but after this will come and enjoy more games here cheers Shayan thank you for the amazing service !!!!"}
{"text":"This is my Tuesday 45 cents and Thursday 65 cent chicken wing spot. Awesome chicken. Good atmosphere. Tv. Sports. Trivia. Happy hour with $3 drinks. What more do u want?"}
{"text":"My loyalty lies with Wingstop, well for boneless wings anyhow. But on Tuesdays BWW has a 40 cent traditional wing night. $15 wings cost me $7. Cheap! They also give you a raffle ticket for each beer you order, my friend won a certificate for 50 wings!!! I loved the Asian Zing, Hot BBQ and Medium. Thursdays is 60 cent boneless night but I think for boneless I'll stick with Wingstop. BWW atmosphere is nice to watch the game as well. The only downside is on any other night the food is overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Subpar service despite the restaurant being nearly empty. The wings were great though! I'd suggest going someplace original on the strip instead especially since we can eat bww at home. I was disappointed that we wasted a dinner in Vegas and had pretty bad service."}
{"text":"Nice pace, came here after being disappointed by PT's it was busy but the bartender made sure to greet everyone and get service down fast. Well as fast as they can being so limited with personal. But over all a good experience"}
{"text":"What can I say I mean please take pride in your food, doesn't matter if it's 10am or 10pm, If you sell food which is exactly what you do take pride in every dish, sure you didn't want to toss my wings in buffalo sauce but did you really have to waste an in tire bottle of sauce on my wings I mean the bottom of my bowl or plate whatever that thing is looked like soup needless to my wings tasted like a soggy mess but I ate it no problem but my sisters food that was a joke her food looked days old I mean wow that was pathetic, first of all her ranches were dated a week apart I mean is that even ok don't you push the old ones forward and the new ones back? I mean who was in charge cause no one seemed to be just 1 poor guy trying his best to service many and he's not to blame for the food, oh and if you don't believe me about her food check out my pics and video."}
{"text":"I've been going to Buffalo Wild Wings all throughout the country being stationed in multiple states and with that being said, the service has never been bad. The food has always been good and if there was a problem it was handled instantly and usually taken off the check. My experience at this Buffalo Wild Wings was better than any experience I've had before. I was served by Corey and he went the extra mile to make sure we were taken care off. Never had to ask for anything extra because it was already there. He even brought out extra ranch dressings and more carrots without even being asked. Excellent experience."}
{"text":"Well if you like cookie cutter food this is the place for you!! There is definitely a science into putting out mediocre food that \"everyone\" likes. If you like Kraft dinner and zoodles type of food this is the place for you! This place appeals to the masses. As a real \"foodie\" i really expect more out of my restaurants food. I am looking for more than big screens and hot waitresses. Which there were plenty of. But for now I am rating the FOOD. I ordered the Fries (McDonald's style) blah.. Onion rings... Blah frozen style and the breaded pickles. They were good but still not freshly made. Onto the wings.... Hey wings are wings right... but it's the bottle sauce you can buy at the super market that separates them!! Oh wait did I say that out loud? Ya cookie cutter conglomerate is the key phrase of the day here. Besides paying a dollar each wing for something you could thaw out and reheat yourself hey not a bad deal. Do you detect the sarcasm? Hope those big screens keep you warm and fuzzy as this place drains your wallet. I personally like value added to my food equation. Which I truly believe for what you're paying for you should just be at Hooters and at least you could have some T/A in your face."}
{"text":"If you call and do a order over the phone for a pick up.. I suggest that you don't. We had to tell our order multiple times because the girl couldn't get it correct.. She said it back to us and it was still wrong. Another girl stepped in on the phone and got our order correct. We go and pick it up.. The order was STILL wrong!!!!"}
{"text":"I want to start off with the counter argument....their wings aren't that great.  The sauces they use however are pretty good and the sandwiches and grilled chicken salads made with them are pretty great.     The space is pretty big and it is a good place to catch a game,  the beer is restaraunt priced as opposed to bar priced, and the beer selection as a whole is limited compared to some other establishments that are around, a better craft beer selection would help them out."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night with a few co workers.   We decided to take advantage of their happy hour and buy 1 get 50% off wings. Our food and drink were good. Typical BDubs.   Docked 2 stars for their customer service. Except from our server, who's name I believe is Jordan, I was very unhappy w the rest of the wait staff at the restaurant. Especially the women handling the take out area. I didn't even order take out and only spoke to them for a few seconds. But they were very rude and impatient when we were confused on where to go for the hostess. You're standing right in front of the door, you could've let us know we were speaking to the wrong associates in a less than an annoyed way.   Based off other reviews, I highly recommend management at this location to retrain your employees. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone because of their lack of customer service."}
{"text":"This location is located on north 5th and centennial! The service has always been good and fast, even with games going on. We came last night to watch the UFC game and it was packed! Great things about BWW is there is no cover charge for big games, but they do ask that you spend at least $25. BWW has a variety of flavors, which you can get traditional or boneless. The fried pickles are the best! Make sure to ask your server how many pieces come in each \"size\", which starts off as a \"snack\" size (but includes 8 pieces). They have a lot of other items besides wings, and also have wing specials on Tuesday's and Thursday's!"}
{"text":"Walk a few extra yards to Hooters.... Horrible service/food not worth it! Walked in... Alleged \"hostess\" took our party number no names. When I asked how long- responded with \"a few\"....: WTH DOES THAT MEAN......came in after a Cards game not interested in getting jerked around!"}
{"text":"This place is near my office and I often go hear for lunch. I have always had a good experience at this location. The food is always served fast and the service is always very good. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for quick lunch at a reasonable price! Definitely one of the better Buffalo Wild Wings locations I have been to."}
{"text":"Went on wing Tuesday for the easiest order possible to sit at the bar. 10 traditional wings took 50 minutes when not busy at all just to come out and when they did they tasted awful. The manager came over to say he was sorry and then only took 50% off a $6.50 bill. It was a terrible experience there and I will not be going back. Plenty of better places downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"OMG, the food service is the worst! The greeter was so rude, snotty attitude.  Why does it take 30 minutes to serve fries & 2 sliders FROM THE LUNCH MENU???  The restaurant wasnt crowded at all, their kitchen was just slow.  Our server, Shaun, was great, really attentive & apologetic.  But OMG, their kitchen is the worst!"}
{"text":"Chefs Need Help Making Salads  Salads look better on paper then in real life. Everything came in big pieces, not designed to eat with a fork. Don't worry about your presentation so much you forget the real purpose of the meal.."}
{"text":"Ordered hot, medium and BBQ wings plus a side of fries and some cheese and bacon wedges. First the wedges were small and not very good. The wings came out and the hot was definitely hot (made my lips burn) but the flavors weren't great. They weren't very hot either. The fries were terrible! Freezer fries (that's what we call them) and I could make better ones at home. :)   The service: We didn't get refills and I'm pretty sure our waiter took his lunch break while we were eating. When we were done he gave me a receipt and didn't say anything so I went up front to pay and they told me my waiter had to ring me up. He was really nice but that's not enough to win us over. Sadly we won't be coming back.   Comparable to other wing places (*cough* w..stop) this was just not good.   The only plus here is the sports."}
{"text":"Love going there. My friends and I go there all the time for beer and wings. It's really fun to go and hang out and be apart of the atmosphere. It's a sports bar, so it's loud. But that's what a sports bar is! Duh! The servers are always very nice and seems as if they really enjoy their workplace and customers! My friend works there and can back me up on that. :)   Beer is always good! And wings are never a disappointment!"}
{"text":"ordered wings over an hour ago. still waiting!!!!!!  the worst!!!!! grubhub is a bs service."}
{"text":"I love going to BWW on Tuesdays and Thursdays for the wing deals. Today we went for the Thursday boneless wing day. Katie did a great job serving us. She was attentive and timely. We will return!"}
{"text":"The wings are good. The host was rude but our server was excellent!"}
{"text":"My beef is with the takeout people. I ordered online and gave my sauce choices. Someone took the liberty of putting the sauces on the side. Even the dry rub! If i'd have wanted naked wings I would've ordered naked wings. I just don't get it. The point of getting wings is for the sauce. Oh and we're minus 2 extra ranches and veggies that I paid for!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, plenty of TVs but the typical place where waitresses, bartenders and hostesses think they are the best in the world, and it's actually the opposite, they suck.  The dumb hostess during an Indians away game with about 20 people waiting for a seat and a lot of open clean and unclean tables, just sat there starting at everyone and didn't do anything. Lot of the people that were waiting left after bringing it up to her a few times. She just sat there with a wet towel in her hands like she was doing something but in fact she wasn't doing anything."}
{"text":"Gosh. Buffalo Wild Wings.. Hmm.  I love their sauces. They have a good happy hour. But they are so slow. Offering the bar area instead of waiting for a table is dumb when either area you sit in you get slow service. It's just annoying to have to wait so long for a beer, to have your order taken, or for the check. An hour should be plenty of time to have a drink, eat some wings, and leave. But it's not here."}
{"text":"Service was good, they put the game we wanted on screen, however the food wasn't great. It's like the wings had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while."}
{"text":"I go to numerous BWWs and this was one of the more forgettable ones. It didn't have that cozy feeling that others have and it has weird sections where you cannot see the whole place. The bar in the middle was weird too as it felt like the restaurant was built around it, instead of around the TVs that scatter the walls like other BWWs. The staff pretty much ignored us while we were there and it took a while to get the food, but the food was still really good. We would probably come back to this one, but there are a few other eateries down this block we may go to first."}
{"text":"Food used to be great, when we could order it the way we want.  Now, they have made the decision that on Tuesday's we can't order the wings well done, like we always have done.  When this was brought to our attention and my wife told them we would leave, they had no solution...so we left.  It's a shame, because they used to care about what their customers wanted.  They used to have great food and service...now they are just another of the hundreds of restaurants that care more about turning the tables, than ensuring they have the service their customers deserve, to keep them coming back.  Bad decision BWW!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because I got lucky enough to have pretty good service compared to a lot of people who have been leaving poor reviews. However, as I was sitting at my table, I observed several staff members goofing around and not taking their job very seriously. It is clear this particular restaurant is very poorly managed. As for the food, it was absolutely disgusting. I ate about 2-3 wings hoping they would get better with each bite but they only got worse. I couldn't even taste the chicken. I feel we paid $18 for a plate of batter balls drenched and I mean drenched in sauce. I most delicious thing I ate here were the dried out carrot sticks and ranch. This was probably one of the worst meals I have ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"We like this location.   We can always find parking unlike the Craig road location.   We go there often. Last night we went there for our 3 boys birthdays.   The waitress took great care of us.  Not as busy as the Craig road one.  We can always get in without an hour wait."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst BWW I have ever been to. I don't like spending time with bad reviews at all but for sake of people's welfare and awareness this should be noted. I came here to grab a small bite, and the first thing when I came in inside the restaurant was the bad smell, like old grease type smell, I don't know how to describe it but is simply bad enough that my it took my aperture away and I ended up giving it a chance anyway by taking a carry out order since I was already here and was going to go back and eat at my hotel. In summary: The food awful: ordered chicken wrap and  -the tortillas were cold and felt old.  -The food inside was super cold -the sauce was cold -the cheese tasted weird -the fries tastes mediocre at best and was a pretty small amount what they put. -the tables outside were super dirty, and I chose the less dirty one (see photo) -I left feeling sick in my stomach -Don't come here unless you have very low expectations or just grabbing high fat and high calorie wings.  I hope they do something about this place because I know there are some good BWW in other cities."}
{"text":"Wings were just okay, some of the wings were kinda cold. Are server was pretty nice at least. It feels like hot topic in here, with the darkness and depressing music."}
{"text":"Against my better judgement, I agreed to meet friends here to watch The Cubs game.  Nobody in our group was happy, the wings were terrible and fries greasy/soggy and cold. why bother having to ask for carrots and celery when they are served inedible, Careful if you are sharing because you have to share your ranch or pony up more money for another portion.  Our server was nice but seemed nervous and jumpy.  This remains my least favorite restaurant in the world!!!!"}
{"text":"I come here every day for lunch and it's because the staff is great. They are always smiling and happy to serve. See my boy uncle dru behind the bar or the talented Ginna! Either way you can't lose. All the managers here are great They always say hi to me by name! The music does a great job of setting the mood for every occasion so come in and have a great time. If you're calling in an order speak to the one and only Morgan! She handles all my to go business! There are tv's everywhere so come in for the Game or Games and just ask nicely and they will put it on! Man! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Holy moly there's nothing better than this Thai Curry we had tonight! It's always been our favorite but here it's the absolute best! We left with two bottles to take home. This was our first time at think location. It had the highest ratings so we thought we would try it. The wings are far better than any other Buffalo Wild Wings. There was so much sauce it was nearly dripping.  My hubby was pretty annoyed upon entering. I got to tell you it's pretty hard to upset this guy. The girls took a very long time to acknowledge us then they asked us if we're picking up or placing a to-go order. That was a pretty weird question. We replied saying no that we would like to be seated.  Our waiter was good. He took our drink orders and they came immediately. But it took him way too long for him to get back to us. I got to tell you as soon as he walked away with our order our food came! It was wonderful!  We left the happiest people! It was a delicious meal and a perfect evening!  It would have been a five star but the entrance to the night can not be forgotten. The girls appearing as air-head idiots that would rather stand together talking among themselves.  I recommend you don't leave without the Thia Curry! We also had Thai Ginger and it was a bit sweeter than I would have expected but excellent all the same. Happy for use it was happy hour! Michelob Ultra for us!"}
{"text":"The food is good but it is the noisiest bar or restaurant that I've ever been to other than Red Robin noisy noisy noisy noisy so not go there for conversation but the wings are good"}
{"text":"Arbys bought BWWs??? Seriously??? I've always come here for sports or dining with my family and i always enjoyed the time here. Now since arbys bought the company ive seen a increase in price of a lot of my favorite foods I like to order. I just went the other day with 1,other person bill was 50 bucks. What really annoyed me was the filled ranch sauces...yeah I was mad at that big time and i was charged full for them. That made me even madder. But seriously Arbys you killed Buffalo wild wings!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay first of all they have amazing wings! The food to the appetizers are all decadent and delicious, but the staff.... I don't understand how they can have so many employees, like 20 standing around doing nothing why you have a waiter who who's working their so called \"section\" but they are so slow ... The service of speed sucks and I'm talking about when its not busy. I do have to say though that's not going to stop me from coming back its just annoying sometimes"}
{"text":"Good happy hour! Had a glass of wine & split the chicken tacos with the table. Our server was attentive and nice, everything came out quickly, & prices were great. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying if there was a zero star option that would be my view on this place. I can absolutely understand why there 2 1/2 Stars here. First off I placed my order of food to pick up an hour in advance and when I got there and paid for it the employee working the cash register said \"give me a minute I'll get your food\" (30 minuets later). I ask why even place an order in advance when there is people walking in and getting there food before me. Not only did it take over an hour but she also didn't give us utensils and our order was not correct. I'm not to sure who is running the show here but it might need a little more help on day shift. I probably won't be returning lol not like they really care anyways. Just be prepared when you go to this bdubs have a spare couple of hours on your hands."}
{"text":"Service - it was horrible.  They didn't want to take our group when we arrived.   The servers were debating who should take out party.   Our waitress took a break in the middle of our time at the restaurant.     Food - They gave us the wrong order and the items weren't correct.    We only received 1 round of drinks while we were here for 2 hours.    I'd recommend ordering room service in your hotel room over this place."}
{"text":"This is probably one of a kind experience Jackie has an AMAZING customer service, great personality thank you so much Jackie for your service!!!"}
{"text":"Since we have a BWW close to us and we were very hungry and only wanted to eat a little bit we decided to go to the BWW close to our the NASCAR museum and the Embassy Suites.  We came in the patio door which didn't have anyone around to direct us to the front door, but we found our way without help yet loads of employees talking to each other (too loudly).  Got seated quickly and after a little time without any server coming over we got our order done. Food came out quickly and dropped off by the runner. I do expect our server to actually come over and check to make sure our food is correct and maybe some a drink refill. Ours on the other hand was talking to other employees which seems very typical here.  We also were somewhat close to the kitchen door and it seemed like it had a screeching sound for every person who came through to the point of distraction! Fix the door guys!!  The food was good and the kitchen was doing a great job, probably because the manager was spending his time watching them while the front of the house stood around talking too much!  Spend some time and find someplace else unless you just want a wing fix."}
{"text":"I don't live too far from here and actually tried to avoid eating here for a couple of reasons;  1.  Poor customer service at the Bullhead AZ Location 2.  Rude employees at the Encinitas CA location  Not this locations fault for me to not come by.  A few people out here swear by this place.  I reviewed a couple of Yelp reviews and you get mixed reviews.  I might as well test them for myself.  Besides, it was 4 hours since my last meal, I was starving like a mad man, and driving on Centennial Parkway.  Didn't want Roberto's, McDonalds, and was in the mood for IN-N-Out (surprisingly). I gave them a shot and here we go.  -Not busy considering it was Saturday night and a couple of games were going.  I am assuming that like most BWW, gets pretty busy during UFC and NFL Games.  -Ambiance:  Actual a chill type bar and restaurant.  -Customer Service and Staff:  So far, the best I've seen at a BWW's.  Tons of staff everywhere.  All were friendly.  Greeting on the way in and way out.  Food ordered and received quick. Waitress and bartenders always checking up on me.   -Food:  Had their Boneless Garlic Chicken and Buffalo Ranch Chicken.  I was never a fan of BWW's wings or even boneless chicken, but their Buffalo Ranch Chicken was pretty good.  Next time I will probably ask that the ranch and sauce is on the side.    -Price:  Cheap, in my opinion.  Bill was less than $10.    -Drinks:  Didn't have any, but who is messing this up.  Only poor customer service and outrageous prices can give drinks a poor review.  Based on what I noticed, BWW Centennial delivers.  Will I come back?  Probably will during NFL games and hang out with the homies.  Regarding food, there's enough of a selection to find your needs.  It's basically a sports grill, so expect tailgate type fried food.  The staff at this location has brought me back.    PS:  Honey, school tomorrow.  Get your homework done and go to sleep early. Love you."}
{"text":"What a wonderful Sports Bar!  We got the Boneless Wings (I got BBQ and Nick got Buffalo Sauce).  They were very very good!  Then we both got the Spinach Artichoke Chicken Flatbread and it was amazing!!!  Next time we're gonna try \"no cheese\".  It's not really on our diet plan, lol!  I found our new hang out place for sporting events!  GO PENS!!!!"}
{"text":"Couple of facts about Buffalo Wild Wings.    Fact #1:  This place serves a lot more than just wings.  Buffalo Wild Wings also serves burgers, sandwiches, wraps, soups, salads and a ton of apps.    Fact #2:  I recommend BWW if chicken wings is your thing.  They have a ton of flavors and their wings are pretty good too.  Just in case you didn't know...the wings are made of chicken, not buffalo.   I've been to this Buffalo Wild Wings twice in the last 30 days.  I got the same thing on both visits.  I got their bacon cheeseburger and a side of chili.  Service was excellent on the first visit and no so great on the second.  2nd Visit Dialogue w/Server Me:  Do you have a lunch menu? (by the way, I know they do) Server:  Yes, we do.  I don't have one on me, but can get one.   Me:  That would be great. Server:  But are you sure you're going to get something from the lunch menu? Me:  Not sure yet.  I haven't looked at it yet.   It was obvious to me that our server didn't want to bring us the lunch menu.  She eventually brought one over.  And yes, I ordered from it.  The chili was good, and my bacon cheeseburger was missing the bacon."}
{"text":"How do you screw up buffalo wings?? I didn't know it was possible.  I am a huge fan of BWW, as evident from how often I check in to the one by my place.  When I was on this side of town, I stopped into the Centennial location and left disappointed.  Server was incredibly nice and the company was good but the wings came out cold and not very tasty.  And I kept thinking my beer tasted like soap.  But sometimes I am weird like that.   BWW is usually pretty consistent and this location was a blemish on its good name.  Definitely check out a BWW, just not this one."}
{"text":"The food and service was good.  The manager Dave was horrible.  I asked him a question and he rolled his eyes and blew me off.  Really?!?  Way to lose a customer."}
{"text":"Buffalo wild wings to me is like RA. Great atmosphere and service, but crappy food. I ordered twelve hot wings and a beer. We'll get to the beer in a minute. The wings were super greasy, like soaked in cooking oil. They were more sweet than hot, they tasted like they were dipped in sugar. The ranch was mayo with seasoning, and even had the same consistency as such. It was overall gross. I asked the difference in cost between a bud lite and a kiltlifter. The guy said, bud is $3 four a tall, and $4 for a kilt, as I began to order a kilt he verbally changed the price to $5.50. I will not return."}
{"text":"This B Dubs has the distinction of being my favorite location in the valley.  Full Disclosure: It touts itself as an unofficial University of Kentucky bar so I am predisposed to love it.  Setting that little fact aside, the traditional and boneless wings are consistently hot which can be an issue at BWW.  The servers are very nice and generally on top of things and I like the fact that the bar and dining area are connected.    Anyone who says BWW doesn't have the best selection and flavors for sauce is out of their mind or really just a big fat liar.  In either case, I wouldn't take their advice.  This location is a really open space and a great spot to watch your favorite team.  Go Cats!"}
{"text":"I still remember the first time I spotted this B Dubs.  I had just moved to town a few weeks before and couldn't believe it.  I knew if Vegas had a B Dubs, I could live here.  I've been here MANY times over the last few years, and, with the exception of last March Madness when technical difficulties forced me to go across the street to Sunset Station sports book to view the UK game, I have never had a bad experience.  Their sauce really is the best restaurant sauce.  I'm partial to Spicy Garlic and Hot wing sauce.  I even buy the trio of sauces so I can make my own at home when I am budgeting.  Plus, I'm a big dork and I love buzz time trivia.  Don't judge me.  I was here last Tuesday and discovered yet another reason to love this place: ELECTRONIC CORNHOLE!"}
{"text":"I remember trying a Buffalo Wild Wings location a few years ago when I went to school in Oshawa and I was not impressed. Either the menu got better or this location was a lot better in general, but whatever the case may be, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and food here.  My friends and I went on game night, May 11. We were seated rather quickly despite it being a full-house (they have ample seating space which is a plus). Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, even though you could tell she was a little overwhelmed by the crowd.   I ordered the 'Mango Habanero' chicken fingers with the sauce already on them. As a South Asian who is down with spice, I can definitely say that these were SPICY. I couldn't finish them in one go but they were so, so good! I also ordered these fries that came with some sauce and cheese but it was pretty pitiful. Avoid it at all cost. Tasted, and looked like elementary cafe food.   I would definitely be back for the food and the great service.   Food: 5/5 Ambience: 5/5 Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"Melynda was awesome!! Wonderful first impression and she didn't fail after that! Thanks for the hospitality (:"}
{"text":"Not a place to watch hockey games! We sat at the bar because it was completely empty, pretty much like the rest of the bar area.  We asked to watch the Coyotes hockey game since all the TVs were playing college basketball and volleyball. There was a total of 20 people in place. Maybe 10 in the large bar area and they weren't even looking at the screens. The manager told us all TVs were requested and they could not put the game on for us. BS. Then a Blackhawks fan sat down next to us to watch the game and they wouldn't turn that game on for that man either. So there three hockey fans sat at an empty bar and bar area without being able to watch our hockey!! No explanation."}
{"text":"It's been forever since I've been to a Buffalo Wild Wings and this visit reminded me why I prefer Hooters to This place.  I came during lunch hour as I was in the area running errands and had a craving for some wings. Finding this place is a bit tricky as it's hidden off the main road and you can easily miss the little side road. Had to drive around the block several times before I finally got there.  They have a good size parking lot to accommodate a good amount of people at any given time. When I got there, I was surprised to only see about 5 cars there during the lunch hour, but better for me to get a front parking.   Once inside, I had to wait about 5 minutes before someone came over to seat me. Not sure what was taking them so long as the place was practically empty and they had many waitresses just standing around trying to find things to do. Once seated, my waitress came over quickly and took my drink order. When she brought that back, she took my food order and then handed me a timer, telling me that if you order from the lunch menu they guarantee your food out within 15 minutes or it's free.   Food came out under 9 minutes. I didn't end up getting the wings as the price of them have really gone up. So, I decided on the chicken wrap with a side of fries. Basically, the wrap was chicken (flavored with your sauce or rub of choice), lettuce and cheese. I was very disappointed with it. It was dry and they hardly filled the large tortilla, so I ended up having more tortilla then filling!! Fries were good though.  My waitress was very nice and came around several times during my visit to check up on me and see if there was anything that I wanted or needed. When it was time for me to pay, she brought my check over quickly.   Not the worst experience, but definitely not the best. Probably won't be coming back to a Buffalo Wild Wings. Portions were small and prices high for the quality of food that they serve.  2 star for food. 3 star for location and how easy it was to find. 3 star for cleanliness of the restaurant. 5 star for the service I received from my waitress."}
{"text":"Good food, very professional and impressive customer service from our waiter Charlie. Kudos to Charlie this guy was very helpful and worked very hard. I will definitely come back with my family. The system needs to be updated though, it kept crashing."}
{"text":"David (the bartender) was great! He served our party quickly and made sure our drinks were not empty. This will definitely be our go to place for late night food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Supposed to be 24/7 but almost every time I call to order late they never answer to take my order. If I was the owner or gm I'd be concerned over the lost revenue, aren't people being paid to keep the doors open and answer the phone."}
{"text":"65 flat screens? Okay. Had a good experience here, though the lighting in the bar could be not too bright at times. I'm not  a huge wings fan but the boneless wings are pretty tasty. Will I be back?? Um, yes. I have to watch the Sharks win somewhere when I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"I can see why this place has bad ratings.  WOW GORDON is a total A HOLE.  we just walked in from a night at the club it's four in the morning and one of the girls had her shoes off I understand there's rules but the way that Gordon came up and talk to us was like we were in fourth grade I'm sorry management this guy has to go you need to fire him immediately he was the biggest jerk ever I will never come back to this location as long as he is employed here"}
{"text":"Melynda was a sweetheart.   Super friendly and great service.     The food was good and the place was clean.  Love that it's open 24 hours and free parking   I will be back"}
{"text":"I love their food. But, the service is spotty. We had a great server and then a large table came in and he got pulled and sent to help them. In exchange we got a new server who was slow and forgot to come back and check on us. I waited about 20 minutes trying to flag someone down for the check.  The experience was just blah overall. It probably would have been different if our waiter was switched out, because he was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place got 4.5 stars. Their food is possibly some of the worst food I have ever had. Ever. And that's pretty bad, as I'm not super picky. I've been to two of their locations and both times I was completely unimpressed.  First time I had a burger. I requested it rare, and of course it came out well done. Like damned rubber. Anyone knows that once you go rare, you don't dare...go...well done. Ok I was trying to be funny and I failed, but you get my point. And the food came in some crazy picnic-type containers. Shit you'd see if you bought it at the Fair or your neighbor's BBQ.  Second time was a salad. Trying to be healthy!!@#! The \"greens\" were pretty much ALL iceberg lettuce. REALLY you guys? REALLY? Too expensive for such a lousy salad. If I wanted to munch on what was basically water I would've ordered a free water! The one I created myself at Old Country Buffet tasted far far better.   The only thing it has going for it is decent drink selections/prices and a nice bar-like atmosphere. But tons of other bars have that too AND good food to boot. Like Santisi Brothers. Yeah, count this place out.  Oh, their logo is kinda nice. Makes me think the buffalo just drank Red Bull though."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant. Don't go here unless you have to. Walked into a hand written sign saying \"Seay yourself\". We walk in and sit down and nobody acknowledges us for at least 10 minutes. Then when we finally get our server the wait was long even though there were hardly any customers in the restaurant. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I was pleased with my service and food.  I visited on a Monday night during Monday night football.  Even though the location was packed and busy, the service was top notch.  The chicken wings were excellent and like I would expect."}
{"text":"cool place for sports or hang with a friend(s) loud and sometime very busy. it still gets a five star based on the effort of the staff to always try to make your time at BWW fun. great for game time"}
{"text":"I don't know how you can have a bad experience at a chain restaurant. If they weren't so busy blasting the fucking music maybe they would notice their shit food coming out. Food sat for so long under the heat lamp it made the tortilla crispy and the lettuce became brittle! My Son Cheese burger has cold cheese on it. I sent it back and it came as a different version of what they normally serve. B Dubs better get your shit together!  What's the point of having a kitchen manager if they're going to allow food like that to come out.   Also, I asked them to turn the volume down and literally I heard it go up! There was a new born next to us and the mom kept getting up with the baby to calm it down.   One star is too much for what your Manager allowed to happen today!"}
{"text":"Even the most creative writers will have a hard time differentiating this location from any other.  I've been to a variety of different B-dubs in a variety of places & this one is just another brick in the wall.  Service is pretty crappy, wings come from the same supplier, sauces are no different & the beer is slightly overpriced.  You know what you're getting - no surprises here."}
{"text":"Although the man behind the bar acted as though his wife just left him & took all their money, & although the chicken sandwich was just average, the trivia was the driver behind the 4 star rating.  I've been to BWs more than a handful of times, & although I've played the TV screen trivia, this was a  whole new animal.  With a live DJ asking 50 general knowledge questions in increments of 10 (including a picture round, sports round, music round, etc) & ~15 groups submitting their answers, this trivia rocked.  My wife & I (newcomers to Cleveland) managed to meet some locals & spend the night discussing all that is good & not so good about the cleveland area over some beer.  So, although the food was standard & the prices are consistent with other BWs, Thursday nights here around 8:00 are the place to be."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars- I would. Horribleeeee service. I've eaten at Buffalo Wild Wings around arizona for a while now and this one is the worst. My food took forever to come out. It was happy hour and our waitress went MIA for 30min and I was forced to pay full price for my beer. On top of that they didn't get our order right and it took them 30min to get cheese dip with our chips. I will never be back here again."}
{"text":"Best wings ever service is excellent I want to move in and just watch games and eat wings thanks guys special thanks to me. Gary hood for being nice to us . Definitely will be coming back to this establishment..."}
{"text":"The restroom are disgusting!  I was really disappointed  with the conditions of the restaurant over all.  Differently will not be returning.  they wouldn't even let me bring in my water bottle! we live in the desert  how are we not to carry water around."}
{"text":"BWW has great wings with great sauces but the service is the worst. The Scottsdale location is never busy but it takes forever for food and drinks to arrive. If you are unlucky enough to go when it's busy allow a couple of hours to eat. The table next to us complained and the manager just shrugged like too bad."}
{"text":"Oh B Dubs. There's a reason people come here and it ain't for gourmet food. Beer selection is good. Prices are good. Location is good. Service is good/friendly. Food is wha...?! Clearly the burgers are frozen because I asked if I could get one not well done and the answer was no. The taste was decent though and that's all I can ask for. Will I be back? Probably. I'm a masochist."}
{"text":"Ok, so I am SOOOOO addicted to the salt and vinegar dry rub!!! I discovered it completely on accident and have been craving it ever since! I will zoom in to order wings JUST for the rub! lol.... I always sit in the bar area because it's a lot more friendly back there and the staff took no time to learn my name. Appears they have a lot of regulars and they have a \"family\" type relationship with them. They are friendly and efficient.  The food is typical for BWWs so no real complaints there. Sometimes they take forever to bring out your food, but usually, you pass time watching the tvs, playing games, and drinking *shrug*"}
{"text":"We have been here many times, and while the food is hit or miss (sometimes the wings are dry) as well as the service, its usually acceptable for Tuesdays/Thursdays.  On Saturday, we decided to give it a go.   We sat at the bar.  Bartender was not the normal one we deal with, and not too friendly.  Either way, we got our order in.  I had ordered Cheese Sticks, and my wife ordered wings.  Food was good, which was not the problem.  I asked for an extra cup of marinara sauce for the cheese sticks.  When the server brought it to us, she spilled it all over my pants.  Needless to say, hot as hell and ruined my pants (stained).  The manager was standing 3 feet from me, saw what happened, and did NOTHING to help.  He glanced over then went back to watching football.  My wife nearly had to yell at him to get some napkins as the server said \"sorry\" and ran off.   Finally got a few napkins to clean up with and wipe down most of the stuff as well as using the towelettes in the packages to help clean up.  While the next part could be labeled as my fault due to not raising a fuss, I should not have to.  I did not call a manager over to speak about the incident as IMO, the server should have immediately notified them.  Well, she did not.  We got our bill, and they did not even take off an item from it.  Afterwards, through email (complaint from receipt), the manager offered me a $30 Gift Certificate to come back.  What a slap in the face.  My pants cost $30 and there is no way in hell I would ever give a business money again with that poor of customer service."}
{"text":"The food was good, considering we went on Tuesday. I literally had to refill everyones water at my table, thankfully I had an extra water bottle in my purse. I have never been somewhere upon where I had to refill my own water. Its not like we just finished our drinks, they were sitting empty for 20 minutes while we ate spicy wings. If you are going to eat food here, order togo because their service is horrible."}
{"text":"Traditional wings taste as if they flash fried raw chunks of chicken taken straight from the freezer. I wish they marinate their chicken or atleast let them thaw before they fry them"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food, incredibly nice people, we went 20 min before the dining are closed not knowing, they told us that we could not eat there because its about to close and the bar was the only thing open, we are not 21 (my girlfriend and i). I not being in a good mood let them know that their sign says that we can eat in the dining area because its still open so they can not tell us no. After a few minutes of discussion we went in, ate , and loved it."}
{"text":"M'Lynne is an amazing server! The prior week my boyfriend and I had poor service making us hesitant to return. Tonight the dining room, were we originally wanted to sit, was slammed. M'Lynne prompted us to sit in the bar area and took amazing care of us. They didn't have the Amber Ale my boyfriend wanted but she was quick to lighten the mood with jokes. Smart, quick-witted, and funny. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm from Buffalo originally.  BWW is a poor excuse for chicken wings.  Go to Barro's, the native, otto's, or Booty's instead"}
{"text":"Best Buffalo Wild Wings I've ever been to...and that's not saying much. But friendly staff, great food and amazing happy hour."}
{"text":"I've gone to this location a couple of times, mostly because the boyfriend suggests it often and its close to home. But, I can't say I've ever had a bad experience. I've tried a few different things on the menu (considering I'm not a huge fan of wings... weird huh?). I think my favorite was the chicken breast sandwich with a honey BBQ sauce. I got a side salad... it was a little weird, but they didn't have an italian dressing- not sure if they were out or if they didn't carry one. Either way, the ranch dressing worked well. We also tried the popcorn shrimp as an appetizer.. those were very good as well."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this location was there... score! We were leaving the mall on a Saturday morning, just before lunchtime and saw this BWW. We went in, got a seat at a table near the bar and were promptly greeted. We ordered the fried pickles (my fav) and I had a chicken wrap. Yum.   The location was very clean and since it was a Saturday, they had a bunch of different NCAA football games on the TVs. Another group of people requested that one of the big TVs be changed to a specific game and they changed it within seconds.   Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nice set up with a spacious dining room area as well as a bar with lots of seating. Clean decor with lots and lots of TVs. I came in for lunch and had the combo plate - 5 wings, 5 boneless, a cup of coleslaw and an order of fries. Honey BBQ wings had a good balance of sweet. The boneless were small but meaty, and the spicy garlic delivered on both spice and a nice garlic kick. I had chipotle BBQ dry spice on my fries, which gave them a solid kick. Nice shoestring fries with a crisp, I liked them.   Were they the best wings I've ever had? Probably not, but they are nowhere near the bottom either. I would absolutely come back and it seems like it would be a good place to watch a game. Staff were also very attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"Talk about bad service! Places a regular order of just wings 45 mins or more to get my order. Terrible terrible service ill say. Ive been to many bww's during full house and ill get my order withing 15 mins. I DO NOT recommend this place whatsoever"}
{"text":"the customer service is very bad . The lady who took care of us takes a lot, I wish they could put more attention on that because the food is very good"}
{"text":"came here with my boyfriend on the 6th of march. it was my first time at bdubs. it was so packed, wait time was about 5-10 minutes.   SERVICE: 2/5 me and my boyfriend both agreed that the service here is just terrible. we can understand that it was busy, so service couldn't be perfect. however, we had to have been waiting for probably at least 45mins for our food to arrive. our server was really slow with everything. the fact that a few of the tables around us, who got seated way after us, received their food before we did was just wrong. we even got served before a table that was already there before us. when we finally received refills on our drinks, he didn't even take the empty cups away until after a table left and he was cleaning up that table.    FOOD: 4/5 i had their ultimate nachos & small size honey bbq traditional wings. the boyfriend had their mozzarella sticks, 4 piece chicken tenders, & snack size sweet bbq boneless wings.   everything was very delicious. the sauces on their wings were tasty, and paired up with ranch sauce, just perfect. i definitely want to try their other flavors yelpers rave about. we both really enjoyed the food here.   OVERALL: 3/5 i would give this place 2 stars, but because the food here was really good, i rounded it up to 3 stars. we will come back again only because it's very close to our house and the food is great. we shall see how it goes next time."}
{"text":"Service tonight was fantastic. Katherine, our server, was stellar.  Food has gotten a lot better. We started with the Molten Dip...a combination of cheeses, chicken, celery and tomatoes. It was excellent.   I ordered the Jerk wings...a combination of sweetness and heat. My dining companion had the Hot Bbq...he said they were good.  When they first opened, it was awful....but they've turned things around and it is now a viable option for dinner plans."}
{"text":"So after work my two coworkers and I decided to go here, it's not busy just one large group and people at the bar. We order our drinks and appetizers because they are half off! Sweet! Wrong!! They immediately brought out two beer and we are still waiting on shots and a cocktail. After 20 minutes we noticed still no shots and no cocktail and the appetizers are coming! What the .... So we ask and the waitress is like oh I forgot let me go get it- meaning they've been sitting at the bar for the past 20 minutes!  Once we get our food it's ok and we didn't receive all of it. We then had to ask and she said no you didn't order that and argued about it with me for ten minutes! Yes I kept it going to see how far she would go. Horrible customer service for being the only ones left in the dining area. Do yourself a favor and go to Wingstop great wings and service!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience. We were in town on vacation and we love BWW at home so we went. Food was great, just like home. This place is open 24hrs which is cool! The staff was great, Raven and Luke Wilson's look alike that was the Captain were a blast. Got a good picture. The only bad part is the location. It's kinda hidden from the strip unless you really are looking for it. But now that it's here the next time we are back we will be visiting again."}
{"text":"BWW is a Great place for fight nights. Good selection of wings and overall above decent service. If you'd like to try items other than their wings I would recommend their sliders and wraps. The mango lemonade is a must, excellent drink with unlimited refills. Make sure You come early on UFC nights, this place gets packed!"}
{"text":"Quick takeout service. Spicier BBQ and Chipotle than most Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants. Love the Honey BBQ Chicken Salad."}
{"text":"I tried ordering wings over the phone at 2am to pick up. I called at least 5 times and each time waiting on the phone for someone to pick up for about 8 min till the phone call got disconnected. NO ONE picked up the phone at all. I got frustrated and went into the location to order wings. There was 2 bartenders one blonde girl and one African American guy. I asked the guy what's the deal with not picking up the phone and he gave me excuse that late at night it's busy and they can't pick up the phone. So I looked around and there was about 6 people at the bar and 2 tables. For 2 bartenders that's NOTHiNG. Horrible service and the bar area was all dirty there was paper and empty cups everywhere!  DONOT order wings from here late at night it's the worst location ever they should look into some new employees seriously !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good (not great) but the loudest music ever. Couldn't hear the waiter. I have been to this location several times because its close to the office. Do not like the experience inside the place. I think I'm done with this location"}
{"text":"I love going to BWW, especially for their deals on Thursdays. They have a late night happy hour as well on their appetizers. Their cocktail selection is pretty good too. I can always count on BWW when I want quality food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Back again for TNF and hockey game, Nikki was great we were at a small table in the bar area , she said hang on a minute and will get you a better table , that was very nice of her , service great, Brittany another server we have used came by to say hi , nice , had mushrooms, wings and Hamburger all of which were good again, be back soon for another Hawks Hockey game"}
{"text":"long story short ... I wasn't too impressed w their wings the last time I visited so I tried their chicken strips. Our waiter asked us what sauces we'd like to try and since they had soo many to choose from I wanted to pick a couple. Well between 3 of we manage to get 6 sauces and to our surprise when the bill came, we were charged for every one. Now I feel like the waiter should have advised that there was an additional charge for sauce for my chicken strips but w/e lesson learned. I also learned whatever their beer of the month is, you can get a pilsner for 3.25... Not too shabby.  All in all the food was mediocre, but the waiter was actually a cool dude, I'll give him that. They have heaters on their patio which made it that much better to get away from the annoying crowd of drunk guys and girls inside."}
{"text":"Truly disappointing service. Over an hour for food.  While server was pleasant she was distracted and inconsistent.  Manager came out but did not address the issues.   It may be time to find a new spot."}
{"text":"The manager Greg was such a good guy. Didn't think I'd find wholesomeness at bdubs because most locations suck but this one was great because of Greg the manager. Thanks Greg."}
{"text":"My review:  Please understand that I am a hard rater.  I rarely award more than 3 stars.  My definition of 3 stars is a good, solid meal with good service.  It is a place that I recommend you try and a place I will likely return to.    The food here was tasty and the value for what you pay is within reason.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Both made for a positive dining experience.  Tonight I had the medium wings.  Yum!  Take a chance and eat here.  I think you will enjoy it.  Tell them Chris S. from Yelp sent you.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but you may get a good laugh out of it!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The service here totally sucks.  45min wait for our order and then another 10m to get your utensils.  Maybe they are just under staffed during the lunch hour... but the food wasn't very good either."}
{"text":"I don't know why every BBW has terrible service. It seems to be a major trend for this chain. The food is always great and they have a ton of beer but the service is atrocious!  Freddie was our waiter last night. He dropped off our food and then left, asking if we needed anything else. I asked for SILVERWARE AND NAPKINS which is pretty reasonable, IMO. He came back 4 times empty handed and asked the same question each time. I literally ate my boneless wings with my hands, with no napkins. Never got any refills. He bussed tables the whole time. It was a joke of a night out.   I know I'll probably be back because I love the food but they should really try and get some training to each franchise. It's always terrible!"}
{"text":"How many negative reviews will it take to make the staff AND most importantly management to GET their staff educated on customer service? My biggest suggestion is start with a host! The greeting is the most important and it was the worst. During ANY major events staff must exceptional!   Also- things required for the table:  1) silverware  2) napkins  3) water   As I'm typing this - I still have none and our appetizer has arrived. Oh and my drink was incorrect which I'm still sitting here waiting on.   Shall I go on?"}
{"text":"Kristen was a great server. Fun, friendly and knowledgeable. The food was 45 minutes to arrive at the table.  Not Kirsten's fault but the place is a little slow.  The burgers and salads were all good and tasty.   Will probably not return due to the loud noise level."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!! I was there last night at 230 in the morning and I was having a blast with all the staff members! Service was great at the bar from Alex and of course who could forget about boneless Thursday..my boneless wings were bomb.com thank you Vegas for a great time!"}
{"text":"Stopped off at this location meeting family for dinner and the place was freaking packed 20 minute wait for a table but that was ok I sat at the bar and had a cold beer while waiting, food was great hot and everything was on point. Service was top notch Amber was just great will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The service in the bar area is horrid. It almost seems like they're understaffed. And they also short you on fries if you order a burger."}
{"text":"I recall when the first location opened on Craig rd., it was great and this became home for dinner, lunch and sometimes in the morning after a graveyard shift. Now the staff on Craig Rd acts like they do not want to be there and can be rude at times. It's not just me but I hear this around the area from others. I have since moved near the Centennial location and had the same experience. During my first visits I loved the place, staff and people were great. Now that management has changed a couple of times the place has gone downhill. I can really tell the difference since Bobbi was the manager here and now. Staff is slow and appears to be there just to collect a pay check; no one has a welcoming attitude. Yes they greet you when come in but it feels like they are greeting because that is the rule. My first sign of the decline was when I waited 40 minutes for an order of wings from the bar. I showed a manager the time stamp on my order receipt and all I got was a, \"oh okay,  I'm sorry\" and he walked away. As of this past Thursday (July 9, 20130) I have decided to stop coming here. I ordered six wings, spinach dip, two beers and two scotches. I noticed on the other side of the bar a customer complaining to the manager and the bar tender making a drink near me with an attitude saying, \"whatever\" and other employees coming in the bar area trying to see what was going on. That was really nothing compared to a couple of hours after I got home. My stomach was cramping all night and the next morning and I was running to take a crap every hour or two through the night. That was the last straw; a place I once loved has gone completely downhill. Now I understand why PT's down the street has all of the business."}
{"text":"This is a newer location and has a lot to offer. Plenty of TVs like you'd expect from a Buffalo Wild Wings, friendly staff and great atmosphere for watching a game.  Clean and big with plenty of seating. Great location!"}
{"text":"3 stars for having a good happy hour with 3$ jack or captain and cokes. Love playing the Texas holdem on the tvs .there are way better options for food in e area though. Just typical franchised frozen food that's fried and slapped with sauces. But great drinks and tvs."}
{"text":"The flavor was good on the sauces but where are the chicken wings? I got wings the size of quail wings and charged like they were!"}
{"text":"We're pretty much regulars on Tuesdays. My husband and daughter love the wings. I, myself, love their blue cheese burger. I'm just sorry today isn't Tuesday."}
{"text":"Came back last night for Wing Tuesday and managed to try a lot of flavors because my friends ordered different things. Skipped the honey bbq because I wasn't impressed last time. My favorites were garlic parmesan, asian zing, and chipotle bbq. Buffalo was pretty good, but was more buttery than spicy. Caribbean jerk was also really good, although I'd shy away from ordering myself the minimum of 5 because it was kinda spicy for me. Others who are more tolerant won't find it so spicy. The last one that I tried, desert heat, was just ok.  Not ready to bump this up to 5 stars yet because the service was a bit slow while we were deciding on our orders. Definitely a good idea to bring friends on tuesdays to share different flavors of wings for just $0.45. And it's really open 24/7, which is great for late night munchies!"}
{"text":"This location is amazing! Fast service! We put in our order of pickles and it wasn't even 5 min before they were hot and crispy at my table! Their electronic ordering pad is amazing"}
{"text":"Horrible service today! Not really a godd lunch place anymore as it seems things are taking long to come out of the kitchen. We asked our server for our check and obviously we are on lunch and she goes to take 2 more orders and disappears."}
{"text":"Why do I have to wait 5 - 10 minutes for a booth when there are 5 empty ones? The managment here sucks. Your hostesses dont know wtf they are doing. Then you sit me at a dirty table!"}
{"text":"Wing Galore!  I'll make this a quick review as the name really speaks for itself. I've been coming here with friends for quite a while.   The menu is pretty extensive with plenty of wings to choose from. It also has salads for the non wing eaters and my new favorite Pizza Pockets that ain't to bad.  This business nearly splits in three different sections.  1) a sit down booth and tables area, where they have a few large TVs. Mostly for the family.  2) A massive wet bar where you have poker machines with high tops tables surrounding. massive TVs are placed all around the bar so you won't be able to miss a game 3) An entertainment room for birthday parties etc. This room also is used for alot of fantasy football and baseball fantasy leagues to draft from. They can supply you a tv for your use.  BWW is great, the service and food is also at a high standard and it has been very rare that something has gone astray here.  Also on big game days like Super Bowl etc it's gonna be packed. There is always some special on wings and beer. For sure a place to visit.  Overall Food: 4-5 Drink: 4-5 Service: 4-5 Coming back: yes"}
{"text":"Can't believe all the negative reviews this place is getting. Have been here several times and always gotten good service."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, -1 star for the service, the wings are great but on a Friday night no credit or debit cards?! They made us go to the ATM, get charged for service fees and service was still VERY slow, I mean with chicken wings and beer how  could you possibly give bad service you ask? By not bringing me another beer and having a table full of empty glasses...,womp womp womp! *the boneless spicy garlic with a side of bleu cheese are my fave though!"}
{"text":"This particular Buffalo Wild Wings is Consistently TERRIBLE !  I dont know why i even went back, i guess maybe because its close to my work but all 4 visits over the last 2 years have been the worst experiences. They seem like they hire young kids that rather sit around and talk then servers who do there job.  This last visit we just got up and left after sitting 10 minutes in a empty restaurant waiting to be seated then another 15 minutes at a table with no water and zero attention while 10 workers sat around talking to eachother.. Avoid this BWW at all costs .. Try Millers Ale House down the street or anything else .. You will starve waiting for service.  WE WILL NEVER VISIT BWW AGAIN EVER."}
{"text":"Prices kill this place for me but it's consistent and probably the best sauces around.  Just remodeled and will say it makes the place much more welcoming.  Been here way too much but will say you know what you're getting each time.  On a side note, the owner and staff are actively involved in a lot of community events & organizations.  The support the community and that is great!"}
{"text":"In high school, I used to come here at least once a week with my friends after school. Not only was the food amazing but the service was spot on. However, I've been in here three times recently with a friend, and the service was incredibly slow. There were only two of us and it wasn't busy, so there is no reason why we should have had to wait 20 minutes for our food and several minutes for someone to take our drink order. The wings are good, but not good enough to make up for the fact that their service is horrible. If you have a hankerin' for BWW, the Las Vegas Boulevard location is worth the little extra drive as you will not spend several minutes waiting just to get a refill on your drink like you would here."}
{"text":"First and last time ever coming to a Buffalo Wild Wings...didn't have to wait long to be seated but was sat next to a huge party, which was loud and obnoxious. Our server  was quick with drinks and the appetizers we ordered (mozzarella sticks) got to our table within 5 mins of ordering them.  The rest of our order took a good 30 mins, not only did it take long for the wings to come but the runner didn't know his tables and ran our food to the wrong table. Once he realized It wasn't the right table he apologized and left. The wings were cold like they had been sitting for a while but the wedges were stove hot. The wings weren't all that, I've had better elsewhere.  A few hours later my brother and I both had food poisoning symptoms. Called the store the next day to let them know and was supposed to hear back from corporate. I haven't heard back from corporate or from a manager. It's ridiculous and they need to be on the ball with things. If someone has food poisoning they better back track and fix whatever hot mess they have in their kitchen. Needless to say I will never come back to any BWW z"}
{"text":"We came in a party of 6 and we waited to be seated. Once we we were seated more people around us started to sit down. Five minutes went by and no one had come by to check on us. We noticed everyone else that was coming in were being seated and they would be immediately attended expect for us. Then 10 minutes and still nothing. 20 minutes went by and that was the last straw. We got up and left. I don't think it takes 20 minutes to get acknowledged at any place!!!! No drink order NOTHING!!!!! We won't be coming back to a place with TERRIBLE customer service. Don't waste your time coming here and go to the BWW on Sunset. There they will take the time to acknowledge you right away!!!!"}
{"text":"My biggest issue with this place is the location.  I don't live out there... but a couple of friends do... so...  $.40 WINGS ON TUESDAYS!!!!!!!  The place is huge.  They have huge TVs.... I can see where it would be a log of fun if there was a good game and a bunch of friends.  There is plenty of beer, and CHEAP WINGS.   So, after work, I wandered (more like drove for ages even though i work on the west side) over for CHEAP WINGS.... Life is good with a table, a beer, and CHEAP WINGS.  Did I mention the CHEAP WINGS?"}
{"text":"Bar staff is great, friendly gals. But this place suffers for its restrooms. The dudes restroom smells like four year old urine. Plumbing, cleaning, remodel... I don't know but something needs to happen. It's disgusting. If I do go here again I'll go to the parking lot to relieve myself."}
{"text":"First time at this location and to a BW3 in Vegas. Really impressed with this location. Easy to get to,  opened 24/7 well 21 and up after 11. Ordered to go lady was really nice over the phone. Only took 15 minutes for the food to be ready. Got there and the cashier was extremely nice. Food was delicious too! Will be going back here :)"}
{"text":"Meh... location wasn't bad and the restaurant was clean and nice looking. Our waitress was very nice and they had good specials (happy hour) but we ordered the traditional wings extra crispy and extra wet. Got the wings, dry as could be. I have never seen wings with no sauce (literally) I know it's not the waitresses fault cause she wrote it. But, I'm not sure how you can't tell on the way out there was like a drop of sauce on each wing. It was both of our wings.. the popcorn shrimp was good but the southwestern potato chips were over cooked and not enough sauce. They were only $4 so I wasn't going to complain. I just won't ever have those again!"}
{"text":"I kept forgetting about this location its way closer to where I live. I honestly like this BW3, It was clean inside and hostess was super nice. My waitress Regan was very nice  the food was really good I had the nachos, they came out hot and didn't take long at all. I will definitely come to this location more often."}
{"text":"Went here to watch a hockey game before they got busy. As soon as my family got done eating they bumped us off the big screen. Service was horrible. Had to ask another server to send my server over for drinks twice. When I told the manger this it appeared to be policy she did nothing to make it right just hollow apologies and lip service with no real sorrow or attempt at real customer service or building repeat business. As soon as I stopped buying food and drinks I was not going to watch the end of my game. Will fire a letter to corporate and not be returning. Awful experience at a cost of over 70 bucks in food and drinks for 3 people and kicked to the curb during 3rd period."}
{"text":"So disappointed by a terrible burger.  Buffalo Wings is pretty much a known commodity - a gazillion TVs, pub food and all.  I like most of the food I've had...but not this time."}
{"text":"So far service is slow and to get a booth is never gonna happen. Wife went in first I can in 2 minutes later and asked for a booth (#84 booth open with nobody waiting for it) I asked can we move? Nope there is a server rotation and the wait for a booth is 15 minutes. Don't understand that at all but whatever. Sat down and waited 10 minutes for a server to take my drink order. So not the worst place but by far not the best. They have some great trivia and a lot of tv's."}
{"text":"Done with BW3. New person taking phone orders goofed. No biggie. Just fix my order. Why 1 star? Mgr came to ask what was up.  Told me that what I ordered cost more than what i paid...then stopped and stared at me. I asked if he wanted the 50 cent difference?  He said no, like he was doing me a favor. It is not \"the best day ever\". Ugh."}
{"text":"Place wasn't maintained well, gave us a corner desk and the corner was filled with trash. The service was really slow, took them ages to get our snack of boneless wings."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings offers your standard buffalo wings (obviously) and other bar type foods. I only go on Tuesdays when the traditional wings are buy one get one free. The regular prices here are a little much for me justify for just buffalo wings.   This most recent visit the server I normally request, Sylwia (not a typo by the way) wasn't available. The server we had this time was okay although I wasn't offered a refill on my drink once the check was paid.  The wings were excellent as usual and I'll definitely be back. On a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Love Bdubs for many years! Service was ok minus having to flag the waitress down a few times cause she didn't check on us much and I was upset they were out of mini corn dogs and those are the kids fave. But all in all the food was great as always."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a beer but food is really bad. wings are ugly and taste bad. Food is expensive compared to similar places. One time visit is more than enough."}
{"text":"I went with some friends to watch some sunday football. Here's the long & short of it: The wings are fine, not fantastic. That was actually kind of disappointing. I know a lot of people like boneless wings, so if that is your fancy, you will probably be happy! I was impressed by how many beers they had on tap.   The service wasn't seamless, but I know this is a new location. I'm not eager to return, but if you're in the area or want to watch & football games at once - this is a good place to do it!"}
{"text":"The only reason I go here is because of Wing Tuesdays and Boneless Thursdays...and the wings are just okay.  I would suggest getting the Jammin Jalapeno and Asian Zing.  The last time my friends and I were here, our server was awful.  He was smacking his gum loudly, which is not only disgusting, but against health code.  He never refilled our waters and was no where to be found.  When we did see him, he was running around the restaurant backwards...LITERALLY BACKWARDS.  We even saw him sit down at a chair at one table to take their order."}
{"text":"All I gotta say is Mango Habanero! Best wings around that I've had so far! Tuesdays and Thursdays are their specials... Great place for wings and sports"}
{"text":"I love my chicken wings and I will always go to Buffalo Wild Wings but I will never come back to this location. Our server, Michael, was extremely rude the entire time and I've never felt so disrespected as a customer.  I dined there last night after a few drinks at PKWY. We sat in the bar area and the bartender/server had very little patience for us while ordering (even tho the bar was fairly empty). After I ordered, I just asked if he can make sure we have carrots and celery, and I always ask Bc servers have forgotten about them before and he very rudely said yeah, they always come with it. So the food comes out, and he checks on us once. As we were finishing up, we asked for boxes, which took him a while to get bc he was on his phone before giving us the boxes!! then he constantly kept checking on our checks to see if they were ready. we had 2/4 payments out and the other two were getting their cards out and he didn't have the patience to wait just a few seconds. And I KNOW they do military discount but he couldn't give us it bc there was \"no manager present\", which sure that may be true, but it makes no sense to not honor it.. what if he had a void, cuz I know those need a manager for that?? And even if that was the case, he was very rude about it and we had 3 members in the group in the military..  I understand most people don't like to deal with \"drunk\" people but we werent even drunk or rude. Just a few young adults tryna get some chicken wings. So if you're in the area coming past 11, I would skip the place entirely if you don't want an asshole aka Michael taking care of ya!   My chicken wings were bomb tho btw."}
{"text":"Worst. Customer. Service. How long did I have to wait for someone to come over and greet us/ take our order?- I lost track of how long. The waitress seemed too busy with her convo with another server and bartender to really notice us.   Next thing you know the guy she was having this long convo with ends up switching her and he became our server. Unfortunately, the service didn't get any better.   Honestly, I only came here bc my friend loves BWW, and the best thing about this whole visit was the beer I was drinking, that was helping me get through the meal.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Connected to the NASCAR Hall of Fame. This is a chain restaurant, with a bar and several TVs. The food is less than fair and at this particular one, the service was poor. Restaurants need to stop thinking that memorizing orders is impressive or efficient. With human error being high, orders will be wrong, as mine was not correct at all. I was not about wait any longer to have them bring the correct order. For a rather large restaurant, surprised to see they were using the NASCAR Hall of Fame restrooms as their own, rather than having separate ones. Tables not clean and we were rarely visited by our waitress, during a slow period. I realize that their attire is based on football, but when connected to a NASCAR place, maybe on race days, they should be wearing race car team shirts at this particular one. Charlotte has many great restaurants, so I suggest to go elsewhere, until they can get their act together at this one."}
{"text":"Fresh air on the BW3 patio. Friendly service thanks to Missy. And one heckuva great pulled pork sandwich with sweet tea to wash it down. This was a 5 star experience and I'm happy to share it.   The entree and side for lunch is a great value. I dined with a work colleague and we ate, chatted, and relaxed...and did it all in under an hour.  #iwillbeback #bw3 #cascadecrossing #missyrocks #jordanwascooltoo"}
{"text":"I've gone to this location since college.  I saw the recent reviews, but my service was good. She stopped and checked multiple times and I received prompt refills. My favorite is the Caribbean jerk wings and also like the deep fried mushrooms."}
{"text":"Dirty table. 10 minutes for soft spoken server in loud sports bar to arrive. No napkins or \"dishes\" brought with app. Management standing with hands in pockets WITH staff who seemed in no hurry. Server didn't even deliver food, and girl who did brought 1 table setting for 3 people. Luke warm chicken, and such little sauce, I may as well have gone to McDonald's and gotten McNuggets. Upon approaching management, seemed it was not an uncommon complaint. If they were swamped, I'd get it. Worst BW3 experience to date. The coworkers I begged to join me will not have a good taste in their mouth about this corporation."}
{"text":"Love the food but every single time we come here the service is terrible. Just when I Try to give them another try, they prove me wrong with terrible service again.  So we put in an order over the phone   They said 20 min. And we waited 50 min. For the food. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!"}
{"text":"Service here is always extremely slow. The employees don't care about providing good service. It once took me an hour to receive a takeout order for their nachos, and the restaurant wasn't even busy. I could deal with the slow service in exchange for some decent food, but I got food poisoning after my most recent visit. Won't be coming back here for a long time, if at all."}
{"text":"Great happy hour in the bar! $3 beers and select mix drinks. Wings are soooo good! Chili con queso with chips is BOMB! The servers are super nice too!  4/5 stars because we had to wait a while before our server brought us menus and the place is a bit small.. Smallest bww I have ever been too.   But I will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"It doesnt matter which BWW you go to, the wings are amazing! I have a thing for eating chicken wings. It's sort of an addiction I have, what can i say... not only does this place have chicken wings, they have an amazing assortment of sauces to flavor them. Everything from Mango Habanero to Asian Zing. Anytime i go to Vegas, i have to stop at one of these.   What makes this place even more fun (as if the food wasn't enough), they have a free trivia contest that you can join in on when you're there. They give you this remote thingy and you can answer the trivia that shows up on the screens. I love this place. It's my previous love from a past life."}
{"text":"Just don't go here. The service is terrible. We have been waiting for almost two hours for food and or waitress didn't bring more water for us until we asked for it. When we asked did the manager we were told he was coming and then he walked by and ignored us. Just. Piss. Poor. Oh, and when we did get our food, our boneless wings weren't cooked all the way through."}
{"text":"I tend to go to a lot of sports bars especially during football season. This BWWs is one of my favorites. I was here almost every sunday since I moved here in September. I always headed straight to the bar area to grab a table. I was assisted immediately after seating. Drinks and food were brought quickly and tasted great. never had an issue with food or service any time I went there. never sat in the actual dining area so i can't speak for the service there but the crew and bartenders in the bar area are amazing!"}
{"text":"Ohhh, you sports bar you. You're too large, with too slow of service, but I get it - that's your thing. Make us wait, so we drink too fast, order another beer! Think we'll be distracted by the game to notice it's been 40 minutes since we ordered 10 wings? Most of the time, I bet you'd be right judging on crowd, but not this girl. I know what an awesome bar with decent/good food and TV's galore can be and you're just not up to par with it. At least you've got a great location for everyone going to the Nascar Hall of Fame and people attending anything at The Convention Center!"}
{"text":"When I sat down, I was on the phone for business and the bartender approach me at the bar. She didn't believe I was 21 so she decided it was best to ask me for Id by clicking at me like she was riding a horse and when I expressed my displeasure she decided to continue to click at me over and over. Food was over cooked and not the way I ordered it. Queso dip was good. Super unprofessional bartender. The good thing for them, she said she's leaving next Friday."}
{"text":"Our sever Was amazing and got our food fast. Right when we came in during the busy football Sunday morning, everything was fast and ready to go!!'"}
{"text":"Skylar was great he gets five stars! for my family who has worked in food industry love to see great customer service and Skylar has it in spades! there is no need to be fake just be yourself and be nice which Skylar has no problem with! will come back hoping that all employees have a similar work ethic!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a lower mark I would. We waited for 40 minutes for drinks and then were greeted by the rude manager, who was apparently clueless about the poorest service I've ever received in a restaurant."}
{"text":"The managers are always nice when they come by your table. The servers are a hit or miss every time. To be honest, it's only worth it to eat here on Tuesdays or Thursdays because it's *slightly* cheaper. Everything is overpriced from the wings to the burgers. They even charge for celery, carrots and ranch which is actually ridiculous. This wouldn't be a problem if the portions and quality/taste were satisfactory. You have to be very specific with your order (whether you order takeout or dine-in) because they often get details wrong. If you order takeout make sure you open everything up and check if it's all correct. To be fair, all wing places are usually overpriced."}
{"text":"BWW has lost it's appeal as they became more and more corporate and political based (or biased) and pricey.  BWW just blends in with the other national food chains now, and frankly aren't any better or worse, just kinda irrelevant and blah. They look, feel, smell and taste the same.  The customer service is scripted, and feels phony. Like the others.   Nothing stands out, unless you like a $20 plate of meh, so so wings and a $6 beer.  They nickel and dime you from there (charge for a little extra sauce, etc.  Not worth the money anymore.    Sticking with local bars, and local or regional restaurants that didn't loose their focus while chasing the dollar.  To be fair, if someone in the group suggests we go to BWW,  I'll still go and have a good time, but I've had to modify my expectations to do so.  Knowing what the once were as small, strip mall restaurant with a handful of locations hurts my review after the became a standalone (hey look at us, we're just like Chilis, Friday's and Applebee's now).   Good, okay but yet, meh...we can do better. Let's get back to that cool place we felt comfortable in."}
{"text":"We came for lunch 01/31/15 . The restaurant wasn't busy so the service shouldn't have sucked as much as it did . We couldn't get refills or extra napkins to save our lives . There were waitress everywhere , just none servicing us?!?!? Wings were average , nachos were average , the carrots and celery were rubbery .. The tablets for kids to play with were $2.99 each ! So that added another $8.97 to my bill .. the BWW in mesa has the tablets for free . Something to bear in mind if you patronize this specific location.  We will definitely not be back"}
{"text":"Ok I need to take a minute and update my review . We have been back 2 times since the last review and both times were great! Staff still seems sparse but this last visit the manager was walking around making sure customers were properly taken care of. Our waiter was great, food was brought out quickly and of course it was fantastic. Here is tip I recently discovered TUESDAYS ARE 1/2 PRICE BONE IN WINGS!! That makes for a huge savings . Plus if you go for a birthday they will bring out a dish of vanilla ice cream for you ."}
{"text":"Had my husband pick up wing they were so dry he called and they told him that he would have a credit on his next visit so about a month later he calls and asked about his credit, come to find out the credit didn't exist I'll never eat here again too expensive not to serve quality food."}
{"text":"I like to come here but when you have some punky ass kids that work here giving you a hard time because you want to sit in a booth rather than the middle of the room it takes from even wanting to be here.. I believe her name was Alexis or something the waiters are very nice though.."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have come to this location on a Saturday night. The first time I had a bad experience because the food orders were all wrong but I had excellent service and food this time.   It definitely gets really busy in the evening so instead of waiting for a table we just went straight to the bar. They told us it would be a 45mjn wait if we wanted a booth.   Our waitress was very friendly and recommended the new mumbai masala sauce for the wings which we got. Amazing! Definitely try it if you like the taste of curry. We also ordered the Bbq ranch chicken mac and cheese, side salad, fried pickles, and cheese curds.  It was a bit of a wait for our main entree but the appetizers came out quickly. The fried pickles and cheese curds were very delicious and paired amazing with a cold beer. When the food came out the chicken wing order was wrong with the flavors and amount but it was fixed very quickly by the server.   Overall I really enjoyed my night out at this location. The food was excellent and the service was so much better than the last time I was here. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Damn you guys really like your salt. 2 of my arteries clogged just with the appetizer!"}
{"text":"This BWW is home to the Las Vegas Texas A&M club for 2012."}
{"text":"We went here last night we got seated quick but it took forever to get our drinks and it took every longer to take our order normally we go to Buffalo Wild Wings and we get done eating 40 minutes it took 30 minutes to get our food and after we eat which was good it took an hour for our check and our drink was empty the whole time we got a to go order and they forgot that we ordered we got  there at 9:30 and left at 11:40 this is not how to run a business"}
{"text":"The people there are soo nice and always so fast love it here. my fav are \"wild\" \"mango habanero\" and \"mild\" and of course union rings!!"}
{"text":"Went in late at night, got sat right away. Waiter was pretty friendly at first. Ordered our drinks which seemed like FOREVER to get. There was hardly anyone even there, there was more staff than people.   Ordered the Buffalo Mac and Cheese. Let's just say it was pasta and dried out boneless wings. It wasn't even hot and creamy like a mac and cheese should be.   My friend ordered the New Yorker sandwich. The sandwich and fries came out COLD. GTFO. We let the waiter know about how cold the sandwich was and he took it back to the kitchen. He seemed very irritated that the food was cold. We then asked for the sandwich to go after waiting so long for the 2nd sandwich, we asked for the manager. Waited 10 minutes for the manager...while waiting for the manager, our server then started with the excuses...\"We don't have that many people on\" \"I am doing everything, busing, exposing, running my own food.\" Who wants to hear those excuses? What was he willing to do to make it right?? I work in the service industry I play all roles at times too...that is not an excuse. When the manager finally came he took care of everything. Was very happy that he took full responsibility for the restaurant.   I will not go back there again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Better than average BDubs here.  Service is good and beer is nice and cold."}
{"text":"Stopped in to play some golden tee since only one close that just updated to 2016 courses, gt machine has a table right in front of it so it is basically unplayable unless you get that table. Typical bdubs food and service."}
{"text":"Jasmine was our waitress. She is AWESOME! Unfortunately, it's still loud, crowded and overpriced. I give Jasmine 5 stars but the atmosphere dragged it down to two. Also, I had played several songs on the jukebox. During the middle of one of them, it shut off and skipped to my next song....which stopped and went to the next one..I couldn't figure out what was going on until I saw a server with a remote control in front of the TouchTunes machine, skipping through the songs I just played. I went up to her and asked why she was doing that. She told me they were just random songs that plays automatically. I told her that, actually, I had played them. She said that another customer had requested they play something else. Newsflash***It's a machine where you can put money in and choose what you want to hear just like I did!!!!! They couldn't get it to go back and replay the songs she skipped and the manager didn't do a damn thing to correct this. It's certainly not a huge deal, but I thought it was a bit ridiculous that they just randomly decided to do that.... Honestly, this place is just not cutting it, even after their renovations...."}
{"text":"This was our second time being served by Ashley Irwin at this location.  Both times, she was incredibly helpful and attentive to us while we watched Thursday Night Football on two separate occasions, two weeks apart.  In fact, she even remembered our drink orders from two weeks ago.  Her friendly conversation and positive attitude prove to be a great attribute.  We will definitely be heading back to this location and will insist on having her as our server once again.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"STRICTLY FOR BAR AREA  I have been going to this location for years and have had great customer service provided by Sylwia every time, SHE WORKS IN THE GENERAL AREA.   And this last time that I went I decided to sit at the bar area since everyone in my party was over 21 worst mistake ever. It took them at least 30 mins for anyone to even acknowledge that we were there. Then it took another 30 mins for our drinks to get there finally another 25 mins after that for us to get our food which was cold by the way. So I basically started eating about 1 1/2hrs after I got there. I do understand that it was busier than usual since there was a game playing, but people that arrived later than us were getting their food and drinks in about half the time that I did. SIMPLY A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I recommend to avoid this place when there is sporting events they are simply not prepared."}
{"text":"Came here this evening for dinner... Took over 10 minutes to get a refill on my drink and I had to specifically ask for it when she came to the table. I wish I was exaggerating on the time, but it was 8 minutes after I began timing and had already waited several before that. Waitress walked by our table 4 times and was too focused on clearing the empty tables and I had my empty cup sitting on the edge.  Not busy at all...."}
{"text":"The wings are good and the staff is nice. It's just that there is always a long wait no matter what you order...including water. Some days it would be packed and I understand why there would be a wait but other days it's like I'm the only one in there but it still takes them a while. Don't get me wrong the food is good it's just not one of my top choices"}
{"text":"Dunno what it is about the food here The mango-habanero sauce was quite tasty and featuring heat with depth and not just searing heat... until after a few bites. I felt like my entire face was on fire! But that's not the problem - I dont know what they put in there but the wings will bloat you out, big time! I talked to a few people who all agreed they loosened belt buckles and farted the whole way home. So yeah, don't bring dates here! Also... they were showing the fight last night for a $5 cover charge. Our group was in the restaurant three hours before the event, yet our server felt it was necessary to inform us that if we were still in there past the time the fight started, we would be charged cover. Hold on a second: people who were in the establishment to order FOOD ... BEFORE the event starts?? No, bitch. No."}
{"text":"I have no cable, no satellite TV, and barely a good enough antenna to get  more than 8 non-spanish channels on my TV.  So, that's why whenever the Blackhawks are playing, or the Cubs are getting ready to lose I'm here.  There's tons of high screen TV's that are always on sports, a bunch of beers on tap, and great wings.  The service is always pretty good, but when it gets a little busy you'll get a bartender asking if you want another drink right after you ordered one from the last guy.  Let's be honest, though...that's better than the alternative where you sit for 10 minutes before the bartender even sees you need another drink, then asks 3 minutes later if you want it (I'm looking at you Kona Grill).  So.  It's got pretty good bar food, even if you don't like chicken wings, and fairly okay priced drinks ($3-$6, 8-9 for the fancy lady drinks with fruit and flavored vodka, etc).  -1 because only one game can be on sound at a time, and it generally winds up being the game the biggest idiot in the bar wants to watch.  Also, because they ditched the Chicken Caesar Salad and most of the other \"healthy sounding\" food items my girlfriend liked.  That's it."}
{"text":"First of all I'm SHOCKED this location has an average of four stars. I would definitely give other locations four starts, but not this one.   I arrived at Buffalo Wild Wings around 4am on a Sunday morning, completely coherent. I was shown a table relatively quickly. However, that is where the quickness stopped. When my party arrived the restaurant was NOT bust. At all.   It took awhile for the waitress to approach us. When she did she quickly asked if we would like anything to drink or if we would like any appetizers. We ordered two queso dips for the table and waters all around.   When the rest of the party arrived she came to take our food order. She was not very friendly. Very straight and to the point. Two people (out of 8) ordered beer, which usually comes BEFORE the food.   After she left our queso arrived. It was COLD. Not even luke warm. Cold. We knew that our waitress would not come back anytime soon, and we were hungry, so we just ate it.   After about 20 minutes we started to wonder about the beers. Where were they? We flagged down the waitress and told her to just cancel the beers. She apologized for the wait, explaining they were busy (note, they were just starting to get busy, she had plenty of time to bring the beer prior). We feel as though she should have brought the beer anyways, like most restaurants would.   When our food arrived it was hits and misses all around. All the wings seemed on par, but NONE of the wraps had sauce. HOW. They use wings in the wraps, and wings have sauce right?  Of course it took forever to get our check and she was less than authentically apologetic. I hate writing poor reviews and rarely do. It takes alot for me to do this, but this was just an all around bad experience."}
{"text":"I completed the \"Blazin' Challenge\" and whooo buddy was I burnin'. It was fun though. The only con: they make you pay for the challenge, like $20 for the wings, they didn't have our shirts, and your name only stays on the board for a short while. Everything else was good though - wings are great & they have lots of flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"Took 40 minutes to bring out lunch ! Waiter never came by to inform us! And not even a thank you after the bill ! Bad service  Never return"}
{"text":"I usually don't give a place so many chances to fix my feelings about them however I've been here several times and every time the food just sucks. I don't mean to sound like a hater but, the chicken is over buttered and over fried, I've had a couple salty dishes... needless to say, this was the last visit to any BWW. Shameful too bcs the only thing that's good is the buffalo chips. Oh well."}
{"text":"We ordered take out about 5pm on Friday night.  The customer service was decent.  We had called the wrong store and they called to cancel it and order at this location.  It seemed this happens regularly.  When  food was ready, they opened each box and read back the order to us."}
{"text":"I have had the worst experience at this location. The customer service was poor and the management refused to come to the table to hear our concerns. There was 4 people at our table and all of our meals came out cold and incorrect. We were then greeted with a disrespectful server. Let's just say this will be our last time at this location."}
{"text":"Quality service, as good of wings/beer as anyone around and a great patio with extra shopping options."}
{"text":"Last night was a nightmare.. One waiter at least it appeared to be working.  She was so unorganized brought wrong order. Nasty food!"}
{"text":"I have not been to this restaurant in a while so when it was recommended for dinner I thought it was a good idea. This restaurant has gone WAY down since it opened. The kids mac and cheese was not only freezing cold but it was not cooked. Never mind the fact that it tasted more like Alfredo than mac and cheese. The server asked if everything was ok and when I told her about the kids meal she took it back and it was delivered by a different server with no apology. The pepper steak wrap hardly had any steak and was tasteless but that didn't stop them from charging almost $10.00 for it. My daughter walked out starving and I walked out disappointed and angry. We will not be returning to this location and certainly will not recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"They are the slowest ever at carry out ... they say 15 minutes they mean 30 they say 30 they mean an hour.... Caucasian girl name jessika has the worst customer service ever.... my tip for her was to have better customer service"}
{"text":"Always dirty floors. When you walk in it can take up to 10min before you are greeted. For my experience it is rare to even have a greeter at the front. Also to top it off once you finally get service in this dingy place they get orders wrong, cold wings just overall horrible. I would recommend wings stop, bdubs used to be my favorite"}
{"text":"Great people, food, drinks and fun. The servers are welcoming and friendly. It's also a great place to watch sporting events such as UFC pay-per-views."}
{"text":"This is the third time I have ordered here and my order has been completely wrong each time. I ordered a bleu cheese burger but with a black bean patty instead as I am vegetarian and it came as a regular burger. We also ordered a black bean burger which came with none of the toppings it says it comes with on the menu and was too hard to even eat. We will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a couple years, but damn, currently sitting here and the food order hasn't been taken. It's been 30 min since we ordered our drinks and asked for another minute to look over the menu. A MINUTE, not 30. Wish we would have gone to burger'z on 8.  The front has like 4 hostesses it seems. Not sure, it's like a group meeting or something . Don't want to disturb anyone so I guess we will take our check?   Update: It's been another 20 min. I don't believe this is all our wait(ress)es fault. He/She is working around the area but I don't see anyone else. Management seems to be nonexistent. It's semi busy but this is too much. Im not sure what the issue is but we won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just waited 30 minutes in the bar area to order even a drink. No server came to our table. We didn't get menus. Have been here before and service wasn't bad but what the heck."}
{"text":"It's bar food. Service is slow sometimes.... it gets pretty loud in there... the food is greasy...  but wings are delicious and cheap, and I love it.  :)"}
{"text":"I came in to place an order for a snack size boneless garlic parmesan wings and a small medium bone-in style to go. I enjoyed a Blue Moon and played nickel video poker while I waited. The order came, I finished the beer and left. The server handed me the to-go bag, we did not look at it together to verify that it was correct. Ran another errand and came home to find the garlic parmesan was correct, but instead of medium buffalo wings they gave lemon pepper. I called and the manager offered to sub the order whenever convenient for me. He reviewed the receipt, saw the order was improperly filled. My original order was promptly replaced with upgrades size-wise and offer of a free drink (soda as I was driving). Mistakes happen and the manager was great in giving a fair reconciliation to the situation."}
{"text":"This place is fun even if u do not like sports. I love the atmosphere its great and the staff is great. U need anything they r here. Love that u can get boneless wings or wings w/bones. The Mac and cheese is nice and cheese, the cheese curds r pretty good, can't aways find cheese curds. Sunday at 11 is perfect to go if u aren't into the games. I like this place eat in or take out this place has the best wings."}
{"text":"I have had there wings and they r so good but it has been awhile. I like making my own but since we r going out to lake las Vegas we thought we would take wings. Yummy Taking them to go we got 2 different flavors can't wait to try them I picked the mango and my husband picked the other flavor not sure what. A surprise. This place looks busy from the outside but there are plenty of places to eat over here so I am not sure what it looks like inside.  Great parking and plenty of it. Easy in and out. Call in ur order a day be4 or ahead of time and they will have it ready for u when u request it.  Looks like they have a special on boneless. Boneless Thursday. Don't forget to get ur sides also, veggies yummy"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good wings! Love all the different sauces here.    We have been here a handful of times now so I thought it deserved the review.  Their wings are the dry-fried kind without batter which is the way we like them.  However, if you're a breaded wing fan, this place may not be for you.  They do have boneless bites which we didn't like too much because they tend to be dried out.  The dining room and the bar section are equally dark and the sheer number of TVs can be too much for youngsters.  But they also provide a tablet loaded with games to keep the little ones busy before, during and after the meal so parents can actually eat their meals in peace.    It's conveniently located in a outlet shopping center so I can see many repeat visits in the foreseeable future for us."}
{"text":"Came here. Waited 15 mins for a server to come over.  Get our drink order and as he lays down the glasses he says \"Just want to let you know we are out of traditional wings for 30 mins\".  OMG you gotta be kidding me. That's like In-N-Out running out of hamburgers."}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day and we had to move because the dining area was swamped with screaming kids that were running all over the place like wild animals. Once we moved our experience improved.   We ordered mozerella sticks, wedges with cheese, and nachos to start. All were great, the processed cheese in the nacho dip is addicting. For entrees we ordered wings (mild, jalapeño, and buffalo), crispy chicken wrap, and pulled pork poutine. The wings were great, the 'mild' wasn't mild at all though. Poutine was mediocre, pulled pork was shredded, not pulled, and the chicken wrap was great!  Service overall was okay, not bad but not good. We waited quite a bit to be served initially and drinks took forever to come. More times than not our glasses were empty. Cutlery was forgotten, and we had to ask for sour cream for the wings.  Overall it was good, great place to watch sports. Definitely would come at a time when kids are already in bed."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to BWW. I wasn't very impressed with my visit. I was going to go yesterday for national chicken wing day but didn't make it. So decided to take the kids tonite cuz they have been asking to go. We walked in and they are showing the UFC fights. But the place was surprisingly empty in my opinion. Lots of empty tables. We got seated quickly and my boys knew to ask for a tablet. Good thing too cuz it was over 30 minutes to get our meal. I was busy on my phone so between the fight and my yeeps i didn't notice. But my boys woulda been climbing the walls if we didn't have the tablets. Anyway. I ordered a prime rib salad and my kids ordered medium wings & mac n cheese. I was expecting a nice rare prime rib sliced thin on a nice fresh bed of romaine tomato salad. Unfortunately thats not what i got. The prime rib tasted & looked like bacon!  Not what i wanted. It was dry and salty! Prime rib shouldn't taste like that! The salad was just plain kinda dry bag salad. Nothing to write home about. The kids said the medium boneless wings were too spicy and i agree. The mac & cheese looked decent but served in a small take out cup. Small portion. Our server Matt was decent. The wait was excessive for the crowd tonite. The bathroom was a bit grungy too but i think the restaurant really isnt too busy. I doubt I'll be back here with so many other wing choices out here in Phx."}
{"text":"Parmesan garlic. Salt and vinegar. Honey BBQ. UFC fights are free."}
{"text":"Food was standard for a bdubs and the facility was practically brand new.  However the service was just HORRIBLE. We were here for over an hour and a half on lunch and that's time we don't have. They weren't crowded either. Food took forever to come out, took forever to get the check...all in all just a rough experience.  A customer by us had to have all of their food plated as to go before it even came out because it was taking so long. Only gave a 2 stars because the food was decent."}
{"text":"Stopped in to BWW after a movie. It was a bit challenging finding the entrance because it's not on the strip, it's kinda off to the side on Harmon. But that was our only issue. I normally go to BWW for football and beer and generally avoid the food, but we had a gift card so it was winner winner chicken dinner for me.   First off, when you walk in its noticeable that this is a pretty nice, new place. Good first impression. Service was fast. We sampled a few beers. Beer was SUPER cold which is always good. Wings: amazing. Asian zing were crispy and delicious. Garlic fries with wing sauce and ranch were to die for. This was a damn good dinner, and no we weren't drunk from being on the strip all day :)   I was not expecting an experience this good from a BWW on the strip... but overall, really, really good."}
{"text":"Happy hour and Tuesday night wing specials are hard to beat. Tablets are fun to use for trivia when going out with friends. My favorite is a mix of the mango habanero and honey BBQ sauces, \"dirty\" style."}
{"text":"Spent many a Tuesday night here with my buddies enjoying experimenting with sauce mixes."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up, big mistake! They forgot to pack the sauces & the food was room temperature even though we arrived earlier than the estimated time given, never again will I order for pick up! Plus they skimp on the buffalo chips! I ordered a basket & they look more like a side order. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Avoid!!!  This is the WORST restaurant I have ever been to! Took us FIFTEEN minutes for someone to take our drink order and even then my husband had to get up and go ask a group of 5 servers standing around the hostess stand. Then in which our \"server\", Allyson, rolled her eyes like she was so inconvenienced to have to take our order came over. She literally brought our drinks and 10 minutes later took our order and we never saw her again. Instead she was gossiping with her fellow workers at the takeout stand. Someone else brought us our food and it was cold. I assume because it sat in the kitchen for a year before someone decided to bring it to us.  Plus, this place is nasty. The servers are so lazy, they would rather kick trash under the counter at the beverage station then bend over and pick it up.   Call me stuck up, but this place doesn't hold a candle to my usual BWW's on Happy Valley. Maybe the Westgate managers should take a class from them on how to run a successful establishment."}
{"text":"Service is so slow...well intended, but clearly not a key driver for management given so many prior comments.  Confident this place would fail were it not close to a hotel."}
{"text":"We frequent this location on Sunday, because well Football season. We have had experiences that were great, and some that were very lack luster. It really depends on your server.   The food is standard. It tastes just like every other Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wild Wings! But oh my gosh... the service at this particular location is always GOD AWFUL! I am constantly forgotten about outside on the patio I don't know if they're just constantly under staffed or what!? I keep giving them a chance since I live so close but never again! This all falls down on management, you can tell the employees are unhappy and overworked probably because they're so short staffed all the time."}
{"text":"BW3s* is pretty much what you'd expect: run of the mill food and lots of TVs. I've been here several times, always to 'watch the game'. Their boneless wings are alright - not bad, but nothing special. Their other food is meh - the nachos aren't worth trying again, and the grilled chicken sandwich would have been better with less char and more sauce (isn't the sauce the pride of a wings place?). The draw of Buffalo Wild Wings is its central location and sharing-friendly finger food.   The best thing I've come across at BW3s is their recent Packer game raffles. For every Miller product you buy, you get a raffle ticket. There's a list of plays and their corresponding prizes - a free beer for every first down, 50 wings for a field goal, etc. The game last Sunday was extremely low-scoring and pretty boring, but they still called 10+ names in the second half. If you're going to be at BW3s anyway, it's not a bad addition to the game.  *Everyone always asks why it's called BW3s when there are only two Ws. I looked up the answer. When it was founded, it was called Buffalo Wild WIngs & Weck (aka beef on weck, aka steak on a kummelweck roll). Now you know."}
{"text":"In short: a standard wings place. Lots of sauces, lots of chicken, lots of TVs. However, both their food and service was better than the downtown location. Our server was great and ridiculously ninja-like: refills would appear and empty dishes would disappear, bills would show up only to disappear and reappear with change, all without anyone at our table of five noticing.   It gets three stars because it's nothing special, but if it was a world of chains and average food everywhere, it'd get five."}
{"text":"Terrible place, waste time. Many waiters, but no one serves.after you order, they never come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is extremely dirty.. I find it especially concerning when the general manager is helping to run food and does not care how dirty everything looks. The floor was shameful and tables everywhere had not been cleared from past eaters.. I don't know about you, but I love looking at half eaten food right before I order! In fact, we couldn't sit at a booth because they were \"working on cleaning them\". Very odd... the first thing I saw was a old chicken wing on the ground, which the host walked right passed... if the outside of the restaurant looks like that, its hard to imagine what the kitchen looks like (what we don't see?. Never going back! This general manager should be fired, so the business can actually thrive like their other locations.... final word: disturbing."}
{"text":"It took over 30 minutes to get our food and about 15 minutes on top of that to get refills on our drinks.  However, their wings are very good. I recommend the Asian zing and hot BBQ wings."}
{"text":"Not much to say except I like it! - Huge beer selection for a chain. - Delicious wings... lots of different flavors.  Be careful on the spiciness level though if you're a n00b.. the spicy ones are very spicy. - They're generous with the napkins. - Lots of giant TVs to watch whatever sporting event happens to be on. - Really friendly service. - Clean."}
{"text":"We've been to several Buffalo Wild wings in the past but this one is by far one of our favorites! That food is the same and the atmosphere is the same but the service is top notch! Wes, the manager is always stopping by to make sure you're completely satisfied with your meal and if the slightest thing is wrong, he'll fix it immediately! Stop by this BDubs if you get a chance!"}

{"text":"I won't be coming back. Period. Most of the food was fine except for my son's cheese flatbread, which was thrown into a basket and soggy. My sister in law didn't get her wings when we got our food and they finally came out 10 minutes later. The service is horrible. The waitress was inattentive and rarely checked on us. The bill was the most confusing bill I have ever seen. They started to split it up by seat but stopped at the 3rd person and threw everything else on the bottom. I told the waitress to change the billing to what a normal receipt looks like and she did. They also did not charge us the correct happy hour prices. The bill also had the food on it that was 10 minutes late. The manager did take care of it removing that item and was very nice. Perhaps they just don't have enough staff here to properly handle the volume because it was packed. Regardless, our experience was horrible."}
{"text":"Good place for wings....and a nice replacement for hooters.  Big space and enough TVs to make your head spin.  Game nights are crazy and if a convention is in town forget about getting a seat quickly.  Bartenders are OKAY....though I find I always have to wait for a refill.  Now onto the wings...........HOT wings...that is 2 levels below the hottest ARE HOT...and always leave me going wow!  A short walk from my place so I don't have to get in my car.........does that make Buffalo Wild Wings green and environmentalist.........nope...just easy to get to.......at least for me."}
{"text":"This was my third experience here so I'm going to be cumulative and say I just don't think much of it and likely won't go back. The food is standard bar quality fare and the wings and burgers are meh. The service, while usually friendly enough, is certainly lacking in quality. This most recent visit I literally was just killing time there to get some work done. I ordered some queso chips ($4 happy hour, also meh) and a glass of water. Food comes, I have to ask for napkins. Look around, no silverware so I have ask for a fork. Server checks on me a few times, all good. Ask for the check, she brings it. $4.31. I put down a $20. Having been a server in a previous life, I'm expecting five singles to come back as part of my change. Nope, she brings me 3 fives and no coins. So she technically shorted me 69 cents and then gave me the option of no tip, a $5 tip or now I have to ask her to break a five? Seriously. I am seeing more of this now as fewer people seem to know what to do with cash. Training anyone? Bueller? Bueller?"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that I was disgusted by my experience today at BWW. The service was terrible and the food was dismal. It was on par with every other experience I've had. Not sure why I ever give it another chance. Don't waste your time, the servers don't care and the food is more suitable for dogs."}
{"text":"I am very happy with the service at this location. My food is prepared and delivered right and on time. They give me extra ranch and carrots when I ask. The attitude of the employees is welcoming. I keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this location 0 stars I would. I've come here multiple times and I order very simple items like wings and cheese curds. Every time I've come to this location staff is incredibly rude. So I decided to order through postmates so I wouldn't have to interact with staff members but of course something was wrong with my order and I had to call down which she explained the situation and I understood but near the end of the call she became so rude insisted she had tried to call me twice to explain the situation then  which I've had my phone in my hand all night so I know that's not possible. Disappointed that they can't get it right with customer service. Ruined my overview on the company itself."}
{"text":"Manager was awesome food was good service was terrible. My waitress had an attitude from the second I sat down and barley checked on our table. I walked in and asked the bartender if the bar high top tables were self seating and she cut me off twice and said you can't sit at the bar unless your of age. For 1, I'm almost 22 years old and for 2 that wasn't the question I even asked. I'm highly disappointed in the service from the waitress and bartender but at least the manager was nice."}
{"text":"Well what can I say? I came here with a friend to get some drinks and some food. Let's face it, most people come here for the atmosphere/sports and the drinks. My friend and I sat at the bar to get a drink and get some food. The bartender was not attentive and was handling one side of the bar area more than ours. We waited over 30 minutes to get any service. I was willing to wait as I was hungry, but it wasn't even busy! I was so angered that I left after the first drink. The Bartender was too busy talking to his coworkers and didn't give us the time of day. Worst experience by far. Please keep this in mind when deciding on this \"restaurant\" for your next trip. Go somewhere else, it is worth it..."}
{"text":"Awesome food, always consistent. Coming here for a while, never had an issue. Graveyard bartender, Nate awesome kid, smart, great conversation thank you buddy really helped me end my Night right more than once!!!  A+ keep it up guys (try the onion rings!!) lol"}
{"text":"This place definitely needs some work We walked in about 230 on Thursday Every server or person that walked by us did not say hello or acknowledge us what so ever We finally got seated and the servers had to decide who was going to wait on us Food was good except don't order a kids meal with oranges instead of fries.  You will get a soufflé cup with3 snail orange pieces Very disappointed in Buffalo Wild Wings"}
{"text":"We went to Buff' Wild Wings to watch the UFC fights... Not for the food. The food was edible. This said I had no expectations that the food would be phenomenal. We ordered opinion rings - they were OK, predictably bland. Wings, three flavors, so-so. One would think that the wings would be a standout - but not unexpected. We also had a loaded potato skin-esque thing. It was the best thing we ordered. The celery was good - nice crunch.   Look this place met my entertainment expectations. We didn't go for the food and I wouldn't go for the food... But if you are looking for a place that is going to reliably have the UFC pay per views - Buff Wild Wings will meet this expectation."}
{"text":"A friend and I went in on Labor Day for dinner and to watch the game. We were seated by a hostess and then waited 20 minutes at the table with no server. We were not approached at all, not even for water. There was only one other table with customers, everyone else was sitting at the bar. We decided to go elsewhere and were not approached on the way out to see why we were leaving. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"So I am a regular Bdubs customer. As an NCAA coach, I like my wings and sports. I was recently hired at a nearby NCAA college and on my second day here I decided to go to Bdubs. So a few things to point out.... 1. The bartender was very friendly. He as a male bartender. I don't remember his name.  2. The baseball wild card game was on. I asked if they can turn down the music and put on the sound of the game. They did it. And then the bartender started talking sports with us. He knew his stuff. That was excellent. 3. Food was warm and good. Beer was good. No complaints there! So went to another Bdubs in the area and didn't like that one as much so I will be coming here as my first choice for Bdubs."}
{"text":"OK. So in response to my last review, I had to put in an update from 3 to 4 stars. I am only giving it 4 stars and not 5 because I still think this Bdubs is a little dirty and small...not like other Bdubs. But...the server, TJ, was awesome. The new sauce came out for the month and he asked me how it was for his own knowledge. TJ was super friendly and chill dude. I know when I come in I will be looking for his service."}
{"text":"The food here is good but the service is terribly slow. Came here on monday at midnight. There was a 30 mins wait to a table. Then we had to wait for almost an hour for our wings to come out. If you are not starving and want decent wings, then this is the place. If you are starving, not so much."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, which at this point looking at most comments it is just me. Usually come here after a sporting event and didn't really receive great service. Not a busy night, maybe the cook was a little behind but at least check up on us. Literally would watch the waiter just sit with their friends and talk it up. Their friends showed up 20 minutes after we ordered and got their order first, group of 4. Please also keep in mind there was only two  of us and we ordered with our drinks to help speed up the process. Hopefully will receive better customer service next we are in."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here every time we're in the mood for wings. There is a B-Dubs closer to our house but they always disappoint us so we don't waste our time on it and would rather drive an extra 7 minutes for this specific location. Every time and I mean EVERY TIME we have gone here, the service is always exceptional and the food, my god the food is AMAZING. You can tell and taste how fresh it is and on top of that, the service from everyone just makes it that much better. I have never asked for a manager to personally tell them how great it is because I'm sure they already know. I am so happy with this location and for someone who treats Buffalo Wild Wings as #1 on my list, it is very nice to have a location that is worth going to."}
{"text":"Had Jess as our server and she was excellent!  We love going into BWW- mainly to get our fill of wings and play trivia.  But the one thing that we love, is that the customer service here is consistently FABULOUS. The servers are always friendly and eager to ensure you have a good experience.    The kids are always happy to eat here and my BF rocked the Blazin' Challenge."}
{"text":"We come into BWW after a full day at the Barrett Jackson Auction just wanting to get some wings and go to bed..  8:00pm on a Friday night,  half empty and I understand why.   Sat us in a section that had four tables dirty,  dirty napkins on the floor around us.   Ten minutes later tables  still sit waiting to be cleaned and napkins  still on the floor after being walked on by waitstaff.  Waited more than 5 min to be greeted with waitstaff walking past us.   Order taken,  then waiter comes back because they couldn't remember how two of the four orders were ordered. Wait another 10min for my iced tea...  BWW doesnt make food great enough to allow this bad of a first impression.. Manager obviously must be camping out in office instead of managing the floor.."}
{"text":"Service is terrible and rude. There was no hostess when we walked in and we waited a while to be seated even though the place was almost empty. Everyone working there seemed miserable and were not friendly. They were so rude that we were afraid to eat the food. There was also an employee sweeping the floors right next to our table for like 15 minutes. We were so disgusted that we just asked for our check and never ate the food. Manager was nice enough to comp our meal but I would never go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good restaurant. Very consistent with the other Buffalo Wild Wings locations."}
{"text":"Good place to watch the game and munch on finger foods."}
{"text":"I don't think you can ever go wrong with Buffalo Wild Wings when you're craving boneless or traditional wings. My favorite are the boneless garlic parmesan with garlic potatoes wedges.  I also love this location. This B-Dubs is a little hidden away, but I feel that it is in a great location.  I went on a Thursday while the Raiders & Chiefs were playing and they were having a boneless wing special. The place was pretty busy, but they had plenty of spaces for everyone.   I like how the bar is located further to the back of the restaurant and the numerous amounts of available seating.  After sitting down at our table, we were greeting by a young waiter who was friendly and attentive to everything we needed. We ordered our wing, beer, and sides and the food was put in no time. Everything was nice hot and delicious."}
{"text":"I went to this location for a MMA fight. I have been to several BWW and had a great experience but this one was not good.  It wasn't as packed as I thought it would be but it was definitely full. There are a ton of TVs which would make it a great place to watch a fight.  The prices were fairly steep but they didn't charge a cover for the fight which was on pay-per-view.   the service was just okay. the bar tender only came by when our glasses had been empty for a while. We ordered food which was okay and over priced for what we got. The clientele was not my crowd. At one point someone almost start a fight. It's just not a place I will go back to."}
{"text":"I use to LOVE coming to this place! I would even wait for a table on game days. But I'm sorry, when you can't even give me some what of a wait time and you tell me it's going to be awhile.... And you have tables that's need cleaning. That's not okay in my book. Then, the hostess gave attitude when I asked how long the wait would be, won't be going back there again!"}
{"text":"Went in with my 2 friends at 5 am it was pretty low volume of people I saw 3 different parties and 2 other coupled people. 1 party was leaving 1 party was hanging out after eating and 1 party was already eating. We were sat next to the party that was already eating. We were told that we were going to be attended momentarily. We waited for about 20 minuets before the hostess that sat us came and told us that they were going to move us to where a better server would attend us. We were sat next to the party that was leaving. We waited close to 10 minutes and we clearly saw we were not going to be attended to. We decided to just order to go. We went to the front and a worker saw us waiting. (No waiters/waitresses, hostess on the floor. Only 2nd host and bartenders. . He asked us if we needed to be seated and we said no since we had already been waiting for a long time. We wanted to order to go. So he said we could make the order but it would take over 25-30 minutes because they were really busy. All 3 of Us looked at each other and decided to just go to subway around the block. . . Bad service. No one in that place looked like they were waiting for food  and no worker on the floor attending guest. Definitely not happy. . . How are you going to seat a group then relocate them so they could be \"attended by a better worker\" to then not even attend at all Or even be asked if we wanted a beverage. Then to be told your store was really busy when no employee was even on the floor attending anyone. Felt discriminated against."}
{"text":"I always get the Buffalitos and they never disappoint. My favorite are the Honey BBQ buffalitos, but I got the Caribbean Jerk this time and they were a good substitute with a bit more of a kick."}
{"text":"This was the worst food experience I have ever had. I took my family here upon recommendation from others. However today after the garbage food they served here, their systems had went down. We waited an hour and half to get the bill. I understand they have problems. But making the customers wait 1 hour to get the bill is something else....  But here's what was interesting, the staff expected us to cooperate as if they were doing us a favour.   After the 1 hour wait of literally just sitting, this guy hands us two buy one get one free coupons lol...  With 0 compensation and 0 shits given by the staff, one of them had the balls to say, \"relax it was only 30 min\"  People of Yelp avoid this place, go to the normal wild wings, the food is a million times better and the staff is less rude.  AVOID AVOID AVOID"}
{"text":"Great food. First waitress Anna was terrible. Inattentive. Waited for 15 minutes to order. Then we ran out of drinks and she never came back to check on us. Finally asked for another waitress. Melanie was awesome!  Saved the evening. Thank you Melanie."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few B-Dubs and they're always just alright. I appreciate all of the TVs and it's an easy place to visit with large groups. The food is mediocre. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service waited twenty minutes to get our server and took another 30 to get our food when no one was there with a bunch of people working!"}
{"text":"This place needs a good manager. Very long wait times, it's dirty, and customers service is terrible."}
{"text":"A serious favorite.  They have the best wings I've ever had, and plenty of other good food.  They have a variety of tasty sauces to choose from for your wings & the price is good.  They have discounts throughout the week ($1 wing buckets, $1 beers, etc)  Potato skins, fries - pretty much all complimentary items are tasty.  I've also been told that the chicken wraps, burgers and sandwiches are quite scrumptious.  I don't reccomend the salads though - why are you eating salad at a wing joint?    It's pretty high energy, with sports events on the tv, an interactive trivia game available to patrons via controller and television, and a variety of beer and other drinks to choose from.  Verdict:  Great wings.  Great fun.  Great all around.  If you want wings and a casual, sports bar atmosphere - this is the ultimate.  NOTE: As far as locations, I go to this one when we're on our way back from the race track, but otherwise the other location is closer.  Honestly, there is no real difference between the two. Pretty much the same size, same feel, same food.  Which, in my opinion, is a sign of greatness."}
{"text":"This is seriously my favorite place to go to when I want wings. The service is always so awesome and the food is consistently good. My absolutely favorite thing about this place is that they're not stingy like other establishments. They have awesome wing specials that they include in to-go orders. Most places require you to eat the food in the restaurant if you want the specials.   Their wings are incredible and their french fries are perfect. Sadly, they are remodeling right now and re-open March 1, 2014 so I'm having withdrawals. :-D  I love coming here with friends and am never disappointed. BWW FTW!"}
{"text":"They don't do traditional wing specials on Tuesdays anymore, but my experience was still great here. I placed a togo order, and the server who took my order was very kind. It was a male server with a very nice service."}
{"text":"I tried this location twice and both experiences were trash. The first time, I came in on a Tuesday for the Tuesday wing deal and was told that the deal only applies to boneless wings and the traditional wing deal was on Thursdays. Two weeks later, a different employee told me the exact opposite. I just want a good deal on traditional wings! The wings that I did order had next to no sauce, actual dry spots on the wings. And the celery was in terrible condition, it was dried out, brown and soft. The celery had no crunch! As a heads up, this location will not mix two sauces together because a line cook is apparently too lazy to clean out a bowl. Instead, they give a very small amount of the sauces on the side wasn't nearly enough to coat the wings and they charge you additional for the right amount of sauce. If you are going to be lazy enough to not get a new bowl, then at least provide enough sauce to compensate. I will not be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"Alexis was amazing knowledgeable helpful amazing  I'm asking for her next time .Aaron is a great manager he is very helpful nice clean service was great and quick"}
{"text":"Will never eat or have drinks here again,first time I went here the bartender didn't even acknowledge I sat down for no joke 15-20 minutes. So I thought maybe it was just a one time thing. I just went back to the same location, played $80 in the machine and the bartender didn't comp any of my 3 beers. I said \"what's up, you don't comp drinks for people playing\" he said the best he could do was take off TWO DOLLARS!! Fuck you. Horrible place to go in a real shit location. Never anyone inside and now I know why. Wings are still good though. Just not this location."}
{"text":"My lil sis and nieces and I stopped in for a quick \"pre nap\" bight to eat, and were immediately greeted by a friendly host and sat promptly.  Their menu is exactly like it's name sake with a few different non chicken menu items including a boca burger, which I chose and enjoyed.  The sauces are extensive and tasty!  The price is fair, to fairly cheap..  On the right day, ie... Tuesday, you can get $0.49 traditional wings.   And a great place to watch the games as there is a whole wall of TVs with all channels of ESPN on them.   Our service was impeccable and the waitress was really attentive and friendly.   Check it out folks, not a bad lil wing place!"}
{"text":"Understaffed perhaps, soggy wings, slow and forgetful service (probably because of the first thing i mentioned.  Took awhile to see the waitress for the first time. Asked for some sweet bbq sauce because i didnt like the garlic and wanted to drown out the flavor.  No offer to replace them. She forgot the sauce or the kitchen took too long...almost 15 min to get it. Wings got cold during the wait; when she finally brought the BBQ sauce for the 12 out of 20 wings i was waiting on the sauce for i said thanks, but everythings cold now can i just have a box (i can fix the sauce issue at home)? She cheerfully said sure, no apology from her or a manager,  no compensation on the check.  I remember now why we stopped coming here awhile ago."}
{"text":"If you're looking for real buffalo wings this is where its at. Obviously the title says it all, but are you really ready for real chicken wings?   I came here for their special 60 cent wing deal .My tummy is a fan of this place. The wings here are a nice buffalo size, the mild sauce is actually a little tiny bit hot & not sweet how iv eaten in other wing places. The medium is hot and the spicy is double hot.   The service was good, the atmosphere i liked. Its a good place if u wanna drink a pint and eat some wings and watch the Leafs game. They have massive flat screens here, massive along with a nice surround system. That way when the Leafs win everybody can see."}
{"text":"I really hate this place.   As much as I enjoy wings and think that they have a good selection of sauces, the service is always such a turn off at this location. Every time we are there, regardless if they are busy, we get the slowest service ever. Drinks go unfilled, mistakes are made with the orders, and you start to feel forgotten in general. It really should not take an hour and a half to eat at a place that 99% of their menu is fried and served in paper boats. Not to mention the fact that they charge for ranch dressing ($.40). Last time a mistake was made in our order it almost turned into an argument with the waitress who eventually pulled the manager over. We asked for boneless and got bone in- it should of been a simple fix not a confrontation.   My husband continues to want to go back so I guess I will continue to begrudgingly go back."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. My wife and I wandered in after a football game at Foothill High school. I wish we looked at the rating and reviews first. Was seated with a smile by a pleasant young girl.  10 minutes later (not unusual) no one has even taken our drink order. It's not busy. Two guys get seat at the table next to us, a waitress comes over not even a minute later...literally, and takes their drink order and walks away without a glance at us. She even brings their drinks and walks away again. Still nothing....I'm done and pissed. (I refuse to complain and stay) so I ask for the manager and complain. Never going there again. That place needs a revamp of staff."}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends were unsatisfied about the service at this particular BWW.  After thinking about it I don't blame the bartender. I blame the shift manager. Shaun's station is the bar and he served his people at the bar well. Hot chick got served quickly as well as everyone else around the bar. As for the floor and us. Yeah not so well.  But as we were leaving I saw a bunch of waitress girls in the kitchen and in dining area not doing anything. Except the two girls in the dining area setting up napkins and utensils.  That's were I blame the manager.  Poor observation of restaurant and delegation of staff."}
{"text":"If you are coming here before a game come early.... 30+ mins to order a soda, another 25 more to order food....hour 20 in and food is still not here."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying...boneless buffalo wings are my weakness and I am in love with them!  That said...let's get to the review. This location doesn't really deserve even the one star they are getting.  First off, I ordered my wings and buffalo chips online and actually requested them for an hour later.  So I get there, right on time, and end up waiting about five minutes.  Okay, sure no problem, right!?  Well I get my order and head home.  Once I get home though I realize they had given me boned instead of boneless wings.  Since I'm not a fan of the regular wings, I hopped in my car and proceeded back to the establishment.  I get there and they apologize and hand me the corrected order.  Well I walk outside and get in my car and decided I should probably check to make sure it's right.  Well what do you know, they give me the wrong flavor and of course it's a gross flavor.  So I go back in told the cashier that it was wrong yet again.  She says, \"but you asked for boneless.\"  Once that came out of her mouth, I figured I wouldn't give them a third chance to screw up my order again so I asked for my money back.  She walks into the kitchen and after about 5 minutes of waiting, she comes back with the manager.  The manager doesn't apologize or anything, he just looks super annoyed that he has to take the time out to refund a customer.  Did I mention this was during lunch on a football packed Sunday?!  He proceeds to hand me a receipt to sign to show that I'm just paying for the buffalo chips....ummm yeah right!  I let him know that the wings and the buffalo chips were both in the bag and then he starts gripping at the cashier.  Finally, he figured out what the correct procedure was and informed me that the transaction was voided.  He then tries to hand me a $5 coupon for my troubles...needless to say, it ended up on the floor as I was leaving.  Never again will I walk into that BWW or any of their other locations.  That one experience has ruined any chance of me returning."}
{"text":"If the prices were better, I would give this more stars. They also lost a little by being out of Ghost Pepper Sauce for the SECOND TIME!!! Just not fair. You will be poor when you leave. But the servers are always attentive, peppy, not on their phones ALL the time like some other places that employ younger staff. Go at happy hour and you might survive. Or just bring cash and throw care to the wind and get the LARGE wing order with four sauces and share with your friends. The dry rubs are also worth trying. You can win a Tee for eating 12 Blazing wings in 6 minutes. Nice prize for us pepper heads to have in our wardrobe. TVs wall to wall, trivia and card games also ongoing. Really something for everyone. Never had a bad time here. Oh, and they have dessert. You will want that after the wing challenge, Get something with ice cream."}
{"text":"Here for Game 1 of World Cup. place was crowded wall to wall. We ordered some appetizers, a burger and a huge order of numerous types of wings. And beer, did I say that? Yes, lots of beer, cheap and huge glasses of beer. Attractive young peppy staff that were keeping up as best they can during a surge time. They were doing a heck of a lot better than the Hooters girls were at the last championship boxing fight, to that I can attest. Mainly young guys in here (hear that, single girls?). Energy is good, you can play trivia, watch the game or hang out. No problem with rowdy friends, its a buzzing place. We got every flavor wing from Blazing hot (pretty dang hot but doable, to hot, to Mango Habanero (very good). Asian zing for the wimps (tastes like Panda Chicken, we all voted). And beer, did I say that? Everything good, great time again. Will be back"}
{"text":"I placed an order to go, online on Saturday January 14, 2016.  First I ordered cheese on one of the salads and ended up with a slice of cheese on the salad, which no biggie but odd. Second the salads were wilted and the cucumbers looked like they had been frozen it was so bad I didn't even eat mine. My wings were not correct but should have caught it there.  I ordered extra ranch but had to ask for it because they didn't put it in the bag even though I had paid for it. The ticket itself was correct they just ignored the fact the wings were the wrong seasoning and there were no ranches. Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Brittany the cashier is awesome and a very hard worker while others were standing around she made sure we had all we needed before we left we will be back solely because of her.... great job Brittany!!!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible, every time we come here our servers have a sour face. It takes over 10 min to bring us water!    The female servers will attentively take the orders of family and male tables. It's clear that they don't care about the brown population let alone the women one! Very frustrating.  I am being generous with 2 stars because I have never had a problem with the food. But if I have to wait 25min for you to take my order! We have a problem!!!!!   Literally saw my server twice and had to find a manager to charge my card.   This is too much. Hire more servers, give them water so their breath doesn't smell, clean your tables. That's all :)"}
{"text":"Love their boneless wings - Asian Zing but always have horrible service.   We frequent this one a lot as it has been the closest one to is till the Westgate facility opened.  Last visit took an 45 minutes for our food to arrive, asked the server for sweetener for my tea and she forgot 3 different times to bring it.  After that we didn't see her so we had to ask another server for napkins.  When it came time to pay - we asked for to go containers and she brought us lids for our ranches. That gave us a little laugh.  Manager came by to ask how we were and I had to ask him for Togo containers.  He brought them and the server came by 5 minutes later with more containers and looked completely puzzled as to how we got some.   Think I will make the drive to another facility next time.  The three stars are slowly because we like the wings."}
{"text":"Omg I LOVED BWW! LOVED THEM !  But the last time I have eaten @ BWW I GOT SEVERE diarrhea . Did you guys change your recipe , add some new oil ? I do not know what happened but it wasn't only me but my friends I went with too, it was so bad it was like shrapnel hitting the toilet.  I miss you BWW but until my well done wings are like they used to be I can't eat you"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time back in July. Went with my family and visiting cousin who has gone to this place in other cities.  First the place is set up horribly - too many tables once you load people into them. Not even enough room to make an aisle to walk through, whether my son going to the restroom or the waitress serving us.  The service (Stacey) was good though, no complaints there. The food was ok - we had the medium (sauce) and buffalo (dry rub) wings and fries. Again, the place is called Buffalo Wild WINGS, so to me if you can't do wings you fail. In this case, the wings were good, so pass.  I can't give them 4 stars (I'm a fan rating) cuz quite frankly I am biased toward that place of orange and white, which I judge \"wing places\" against. To me they are perfection. This place is good and it's closer to me, so will do, particularly when it cools off and the football games are on."}
{"text":"Being away for six months I missed a few places, and on top of my list was bww.  Not just any bww, but this one.  I have been to a few and they don't compare to \"my\" bww.  So when I came home and finally walked in I knew I was now officially home.  I love bww but this location is my favorite by far.  I think it's the consistency of the food and service also the bar area is much larger than others I have been too.  The truth is out of all the glitz and fancy bars on the strip and locally for me this place will always be my first choice."}
{"text":"Every time I've been there the beer is cold & the food & service is great. The bartenders are friendly and do a great job, and of course the tv's & sports are awesome."}
{"text":"We loved going here, but have now taken it off of our list of places to go. My husband and I got his usual chicken sandwich and the meat was so small, so it was mostly all bun. Then they nickel and dime you for kids meals with extra oranges or drinks. Red Robin, doesn't charge extra for that stuff so we will probably be going there next time. Big disappointment because we used to love this place."}
{"text":"I had a pretty disappointing experience due to the rudeness of the bartender. She openly mocked me as well as other customers... and she also openly took a sip out of a customers beer which is extremely illegal in the state as well as incredibly unprofessional. I'll never go back because of the rudeness and eye rolling she gave to me the entire time I was sitting there. BWW corporate should be embarrassed to have her, Tay, working for them."}
{"text":"I'm not one to frequent restaurant chains, but I have to admit that I do love me some buffalo wings from B-Dubs. I usually order the wings to go, but when I don't feel like making a mess at home, we'll dine in. Even on game nights (which I think is every night, they have like 50 screens with different games playing) there is never a wait, the place is so big.   I always order the traditional wings with hot sauce and a basket of potato wedges with cheese. Sometimes I order the boneless wings, with hot sauce as well. I would recommend you order them extra wet, sometimes they scrimp on the sauce.    On another note, be aware that the speed limit is 35 mph, not 45, despite the fact that it is not a residential area. I found out the hard way. Yikes."}
{"text":"While this may be more indicative of the chain than this specific location I have to say after months of frequenting the Happy Valley store, and having no issues, both times I've ordered from here the order has been incorrect.  E.G.,  No sauce/wrong sauce. It's been on time,  but returning to get them fixed  x2 in 2 orders. nah.    My biggest cause of star loss is that BWW changed the policies in store on wing sizes, they used to say, ( at least 5,  at least 10, etc but no longer on the online order. For at least a week after this change, the online order wasn't updated and claimed a number/ price that you didn't get when you turned up in store.  For us, a wing here or there is minor but in all their stores that adds up.  I sent them a message through their contact form, got the usual we're looking at it, then nothing, I pinged them a couple of times via Twitter/ Facebook..still nothing.  update: The corp office didn't contact me until I filled out a complaint with our local consumer protection agency."}
{"text":"Bar:  ok  let's call it a bar like object which is closer to the truth.  No cider.  Order a 12 y/o single malt.. Dont' know the names available  but aha  she   found one, then couldn't get the price on it , then did..  The cider I can kind of overlook it's not that common but   Scotch? You're a fricking bar act like one.  Isn't Scottsdale for posers and  drinking 12 year old single malts  part of that? ( I have a celtic passport so I have a pass:)       Their hottest wings are  actually hot , I had the boneless ones this time out and while they are  just ok they  at least live up to the heat part which is often more a label attached to anything that's seen a pepper somewhere in its life.    Service, apart from the scotch issue was pleasant and attentive.   Average  frozen desert cheesecake and  let's be honest it's not a destination for food as much as a place to kill time  prior to the movie. Having said that their wings beat the snot out of what Harkins will push your way as chicken :)  Screens are plentiful,  decent bar and arcade games  but they are inconsistent with what music is played, at which volume. ( least tonight)  It's pretty much as expected.  Edited to remove typos and hopefully improve grammar."}
{"text":"We want late at night and first there was no greeter so we stood for a few minutes will we were welcomed. After that we were not given silverware so my sister had to go and get it herself. Our server was not very good either. It took 15 minutes and my sister informing someone we didn't have a server for him to finally come and after that we did not see him hardly at all. The food was good, but service was terrible. We were able to have a nice server help up and refill our drinks more then our actual server. I don't mind not getting exceptional service but I was given less than normal."}
{"text":"I love the wings at Buffalo Wild Wings.  The sauces are tasty and I love the crispiness.  The reason I won't give them 5 stars is the size of the wings. It seems every time I come here they keep getting bigger and bigger.  The smaller the wing, the better."}
{"text":"Whitney improves sales in service in a manner that attracts people to come here more often. She's also my favorite person to look at, (which I'm sure a lot of people think)"}
{"text":"This is a great sports bar any day. Good food, fun atmosphere. But tonight it went above and beyond. I was craving potato chips like a mofo. They don't serve them. Our server, Jennifer (also a manager) found an unopened bag from somewhere and brought them to me. I was tickled to death! My favorite bdubs of them all!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor service all the way around.  We waited quite a while for anyone to come to our table. When she finally made it to us, she was quick to tell us we really weren't on of her tables but she was picking it up. That was evident the whole time. Our drinks came slow and were never refilled.  Our food took forever and when it finally came my order was 75% wrong.  The manager finally stopped by and refilled our drinks. When she back with the corrected plate, she did apologize and say she was going to take care of that entree on the check.....that was great except when the check came, IT WAS ON THERE. The service was so bad that when the waitress brought the check, which was also wrong, she said, \"oh if you are paying cash you don't need to worry about a tip at all.\" No kidding.    On a positive note, the food was good, especially the fried cheese curds."}
{"text":"I came in here after a long day of work and wanted something I knew about. I am not the biggest fan of bww but I enjoy choosing dif flavors from their variety. Well I didn't even get to choose and will not be coming back. I recommend you just stay away and not waste your time.   I was seated very quickly and began to look over the menu. 5 min go by and no waitress has come up to me to get my drink order. Let me tell you, it's a Tuesday night and could count the people in the section on two hands and missing 3 fingers and there was 3 waitresses in this section so being busy isn't an excuse.   10 minutes go by and still nobody, now I'm getting aggregated. I started to look at waitress for a greeting, can I help you, how are you? NOTHING they would glacé and go on with what they were doing  After 15 minutes I decided to ask for the manager because I was done. He apologized but I was not going to stay somewhere with this type of customer service. If anybody took the time to read this, don't go. Us and the others who have reviewed are right, this is a horrible franchise. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to Wild Wings, a ton of dif flavors, much more than bww and a friendly environment with employees that cater u customers, weird."}
{"text":"Slow service. Hostess was rude and I had to get her attention to get a table because she was talking with other staff and looking at her phone. Server was unprofessional. Food quality was poor by BWW standards. On multiple visits this location has failed to live up to the typical BWW experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I watched the UFC fight here tonight and it was packed! But luckily we arrived early to grab a table. The service was fantastic. For how many people were there for the fight, the crew was on top of it and the service was great. Our server, Eduardo, was great. Came around often to make sure we were good to go, refilled our drinks if needed, our food came out in a timely manner. The hostess were also very attentive for the large crowd tonight. I was very impressed. My first time attending a UFC showing at BDubs and I can't complain. Had a great time. Thanks guys for making the experience great!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location before, but years ago and before Yelp was a thing. Anyways, I had lunch earlier today with my sister since it was close to my work.   We were seated quickly as it was a slow time of the day. Our server was Melissa and she was AMAZING. If the manager is reading this, please be sure to tell Melissa I would come back because of her. She was on top of our waters and drink orders and was just overall great. Even brought out an extra honey sauce that my sister liked to take it to go for the food. Thank you Melissa!   We ordered Fried Pickles, Mini Corn Dogs, Fries, and Boneless Chicken. All were delicious BUT the fries. The first batch of fries tasted old and as if it was sitting under the heat lamp for awhile. I asked Melissa if we could get another batch of fries and she did quickly. She mentioned that another server must have not grabbed it for another order so she grabbed the wrong one, but I was thinking, after a few minutes, why weren't they tossed out so it wouldn't be brought out? But the situation was fixed so no harm no foul. The fries is the reason why I took off one star.   Overall our lunch date was great. All because of Melissa honestly. I would go back just to have her serve me again. She was on top of everything and one of the best servers ever."}
{"text":"Hmm ... not having that great experience. We are craft beer drinkers and trivia players. Nicole at the bar directed me to get my own box. Said she couldn't put trivia on a TV and then later did after we again requested. Hmm. Bar staff are in the hospitality industry. Managers need to remind them of that and everyone else who works in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Still a 2. We usually try to sit at the bar to chat with others at the bar and get to interact with the staff.  Bar staff not attentive today,  no smiles, all business.  This is the hospitality industry,  not an assembly line. Watching others waiting a bit to even get recognized."}
{"text":"I love this location!! It's always empty , they have a huge parking lot, and the wings actually come with a lot of sauce ! Compared to the location on Craig , which the wings are always dry! Also the customer service here is amazing! There's this guy that's served me a couple of times I believe his name is Pablo, but this guys is hilarious!! He's really nice , always has our orders correct and is always making me and my husband laugh. But definitely come check this location out , it's way better than the Craig location."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Buffalo Wild Wings as I was a frequent go-er when I lived in Virginia. I always order a blend of sauce/flavors for the traditional wings and by going to this location it has proved to me that there is consistency which is just what I was looking for. Although, a bit far from my house I'm sure it will expand more in Canada if they market themselves a bit better as there is high competition when it comes to wings restaurants. I would go much more often if closer to my house or one closer to the GTA."}
{"text":"I love this spot. I didn't know it is open 24 hrs. Excellent service. Food was up to the standards of Buffalo Wild Wings. i look forward to coming here more often when baseball season starts."}
{"text":"Arrived here at 11 pm last night with my boyfriend. We were seated and waited on by Rachel. We sat in the bar area which was empty.  We ordered fried pickles and mozzarella sticks. Our server arrived shortly with both of our appetizers but only dropped the fried pickles and walked away with the mozzarella sticks. Came back 5 minutes later when she finally realized she forgot to give us the second appetizer. Food was great. 5 mild wings, 5 of the hottest wings, and 5 honey mustard. My boyfriend asked for a water before our meal and we never received that. During the middle of our meal I asked for a water. Waited about 10 minutes, while I watched my server pick up the bar menus from the tables while singing and looking like she was in her own world. Once she acknowledged me she realized she forgot my water. Finally received my water then Rachel completely disappeared for 30 minutes!! I ran out of the one water that the two of us had to share. Just about got up and got my own drink but didn't want to seem rude. She finally came out of what seemed like the break room to check up on us. Asked for the check, tipped her 12%, very disappointed. She seemed completely out of it. Won't be back to this location again."}
{"text":"My Husband and I have been coming to this location since late 2004 when my husband and I just started dating, before I moved here, waaaaay before smart phones were the norm and Yelp had an app on smart phones-- you had to go on your phone web browser to access Yelp... Long time right? And on my most recent visit to this location on Tuesday, 6/21/2016, I dec'd that was going to be my last visit to this location and here's why...  I just got out of work, it had been a stressful week and it was only TUESDAY and I wanted to have an adult beverage or 5. We walked through the doors at 6:30pm and at this point and I knew that HH ended at 7pm so there was not much time to order at HH prices. We did not realize that there was a soccer game on the tele and the place was not boxing match or football busy but mighty busy for a Tuesday. We opted to sit at the bar and we were able to snag the last two seats next to one another and luckily they were the cushy chairs.  Around 6:45pm we placed our orders for drinks and food. I ordered a beer and street tacos via HH menu and hubs ordered a water and 6 wings. T'was 6:57pm and I tried several times to grab the attention of our server/bartender behind the bar to place our orders before HH ended but... They were sooooooo behind on drink orders that they had 2 people manning the draft beers (they were in such a hurry that those beers had so much head, it was gross), one being one of the managers from what I could tell. Needless to say, I was not able to get another drink before HH ended. That's fine, not angry, I ordered food and I'll be happy once I consume it.   Now it's 7:25pm... No food. Being as hangry as I was, I grabbed the attention of another server/bartenders and let her know what was going on. She proceeds to tell that \"we're noticing that it's taking about 45 mins for food.\", no apology, no heads up 20 mins ago, no comp drink, NOTHING. Hubs tells her that \"we'll pay for the beer\", she tries to tell us the food should be out soon but we're not having any of it anymore, this is fucked up. I'm hangry and at this point, so is my husband. Our server/bartender gives us tab for $4+, he leaves a $5 and we skidaddle.   We've been here to watch football, basketball, baseball, boxing matches, UFC fights and sometimes just to eat and not watch anything at all. There were times that the place was filled to the gills, people were shoving people for space (in the bar) and people would get into tiny scuffles w/ one another from there being no space or simply from being liquored up, one time someone tried to fight w/ the manager. There was a time when some idiot was so drunk he dec'd that it was a good idea to grab me where he shouldn't have... And yet we returned no matter the experiences we had w/ the riff raff bc the service was always on point. My husband and I have become friends w/ some of the servers (some who no longer work here) so this day was a real \"WHAT THE FRACK\" experience. We're not coming back, not even for late night eats/drinks which was always my favorite. Not one time for as long as we've been coming here in 10+ years have we experienced such shitty service, never rec'd our food, and not one person was apologetic about it. I mean, the server/bartender spat out a very forced \"sorry\" but by the look on his face basically said that he didn't give a crap.   This was THE worst experience we've ever had here and will NOT come back.    #byefelicia"}
{"text":"This restaurant chain continues to arise in business conversations due to: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/business/economy/13wings.html.  All the MBAs are talking about it.  I've been polite enough to table my Michael Pollan and Food Inc based concerns during such discussions.  So long as you know all that, cool.  As for the food - lots of great sauce combinations, but can you really enjoy them if you're skeptical of the basic ingredient, the chicken? Not really.  The beer selection - super large tap, but very few (if any) micro-brews. BUMMER.  But! The real reason we were here - to watch the 2012 Presidential Election. And for this occasion, this place was awesome. Chill. Nonchalant. Lots of TVs. And we could each pick our own respective stations from a compilation of sources.   (Yes, I watched with my boss. And we had a swell evening.)"}
{"text":"This location is smaller than the one on dessert springs. It also seemed to be less crowded during their HH that starts at 10p.m.   Server was awesome, and I just love their Asian Zing wings, so, WOOOOOO!"}
{"text":"Thursday nights they have 65 cents boneless wings. You'll have to order a minimum of four. I still love the Asian zing flavor the best.   Mini corn dogs- 4 stars. Who doesn't love a corn Dog? A deal for $3 during HH.   ONION RINGS- 3.5 stars. They were good. Can't complain for $3.   Chocolate fudge cake- 2 stars. I'm demoting this cake from a higher rating. It wasn't as good as I remember.   I still like this place a lot. Their HH from 10pm-5am or so is pretty rad."}
{"text":"Wednesday, 50 cent wing night. Walked in about 9:45, so host. So we cruised over to the bar area. about 3 watress walked by us without saying anything. No \"hello\"s or \"have a seat\" or \"we'll be with you shortly\". Nothing! I felt awekward... Didn't want to just sit somewhere any get ignored (referrence: thread about couple getting arrested)  After wondering around, we ended up at the bar. Took few minutes for bartender to come over too. So by the time he came and took our order, it was happy hour! Yay for slow service!!!  Anyways... beer selection was awesome. Drink deals were not. I thought Happy hour means cheap beer? I guess not here. If there were, they didn't tell us.  I know it's a wing store and we should get wing. But nothing on their menu sounds good other than wings. Why do you even have other food items? Wings it is... So my friend didn't know how big the wings were, it was more like a drum stick, he ordered a dozen. 2 of 6 flavors. They were pretty good.   The evening went pretty well, just like any other sports bar, but way too bright inside. Bright light + drinking = headache. So almost closing time, a guy next to us offered to buy us drinks. Not just a drink, but Irish car bomb. OMG worst hangover ever. I had to leave my car there and call a cab. When a patron says \"no, I don't need more drink\" the good bartender shouldn't serve more drink. Even though obnoxious guy offer to buy them. Let's think safety before upselling.   Wings were good, but I won't go back."}
{"text":"Great new location!  Was in the area and had to get my Curry wing fix on!  Big, open store in one of those confusing outdoor eating plazas with tons of restaurants and parking lots that get ya lost.  We had salad, wings and queso dip.  All can out SUPER fast and just how we ordered it.  Beers were good (even though they didnt have any beer specials)...hmmmm.  The servers were all young but super friendly and at times a little too attentive.  There was a bunch of corporate types still going over the store so things ran like a top.  Now lets hope this keeps up after they leave!"}
{"text":"Good wings and cold beer.  Curry wings rock my socks..  Most servers are good.  The last one I had was bad though.  Way better than the Rocky River one..."}
{"text":"Its been almost 3 years since my last review so I thought an update is due.  Had a coupon for free wings I had won from the Lido in a coloring contest.  Used the coupon, had mini corndogs and some beers.  It was also bonerless wing night so I added a few of them bad boys to my order.  To keep in true Yelp fashion I had Thai Curry and Teryaki sauce for dipping.  Hopefully they will have more exotic, random, third world flavors the keep people happy on here.  Hopefully Botswana Bogobe (porridge) and Cambodian Khmer () flavors are in the works.  Previously, the kids workin were my biggest gripe but the ones they had yesterday were all fun!  Even saw a manager or two walking around.  Food is super processed and salty but when they have good deals on wings and beer, I can do it once and a while.  When Im feelin' squirrely...."}
{"text":"New female manager came in from New Jersey finishing college excellent excellent excellent customer service make sure that my daughter and I was well taken care of thank you very much once again to you"}
{"text":"Came late.  Manager was excellent in helping me decide distant boneless chicken  flavors"}
{"text":"I'm a big B-Dubbs fan, since back in college. And I continue to frequent this one even though my review isn't superb. The design of the place isn't bad, except for the bathrooms being right by the front door, past the hostess stand. I don't need a \"thanks, have a nice night\" when I go to pee everytime.  I generally go on the wing special nights, Tuesday and Thursday. Not normally very busy, but on several occasions I've waited 10 or more minutes to have someone take my drink order. Once the girl took the order, then disappeared. Another server took over and seemed confused as to what happened to her.  Food has been good, can't really mess up Wings. Well, you can, but they haven't. Drink specials leave alot to be desired. 5 bucks for a Budweiser isn't a deal. Hopefully in time they will improve, it is a new location, but the time for growing pains to be over is now."}
{"text":"Came to this place cs I heard the wings were really good . I mean the food was great BUT the service was awful !! The waiters take forever to bring your food/refills . They forget everything & totally ignore you . HORRIBLE !!"}
{"text":"bad service. the staff have an attitude problem borderline rude! its sadbec we love to eat in this resto but not worth it having bad staff. very sad. im not sure if itsbec its the night shift so there cranky! oh well they lost our business."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is a great place to hang out, have a drink, and truly have an American dining experience. Commonly referred to as \"B-Dubbs\", this restaurant is a great place to hang out at during a game and has a great happy hour, which includes both drinks and snacks. Get here early on game day, since it's bound to fill up quickly. Feeling brave? Try the Blazin' Challenge, which includes eating 12 Blazin' Wings in 6 minuets or less - NOTE: you must sign a legal waiver to participate, due to the nature of the sauce, which is 60 times hotter than a jalapeño."}
{"text":"Great service here! Not sure why some people complain a out there not being any deals I got a 20oz pint of Canadian for $5.95! Tons of Samsung tablets to play poker on around the bar between games, and let me tell you there is every game playing on the numerous screens you are surrounded with.   Bartenders are friendly, especially Sarah. I saw the GM Chris helping out and chatting up the numerous tables present. Seemed semi busy at the time as one game was ending and another was starting.   Seemed to be lots of staff helping people, washrooms clean and hands free towel dispenser always a plus.   All around pretty great place to catch a game!"}
{"text":"Planned on watching boxing at this location b/c an employee told me they would be showing the fight. When I came to actually view the fight they were not showing it. I only go to establishments that have competent employees. I will not be back"}
{"text":"After we were seated we waited and waited and none of the servers even acknowledged us. Finally we just left. The time before that I ordered nachos and one had an obvious bite taken out of it. To top it off the bartender couldn't make a Long Island iced tea. I'll never return to this location. I don't understand how it stays open."}
{"text":"Mandy great server, always happy, remembers what you order, nice to speak with... Generally nice place, big selection of beers"}
{"text":"So disappointed in our dinner tonight. All I wanted were my honey BBQ boneless wings ... and I pretty much got tough chicken nuggets with a little bit of sauce .. all of our food was cold, chicken is tough and wings are DRRYYYY!!! We usually order out from here a couple times a month and this was just bad ... I'm only eating what I can because I'm hungry. We might have to take a break from here .. $60.00 worth of food and we can barely eat it .. I know it was a busy night .. but that's not an excuse"}
{"text":"By far my worst experience ever at a Buffalo Wild Wings, honestly from the moment I walked in I get harassed, I walked through the doors and I had a sports drink in my hands because I need electrolytes for the specific regime I am on, anyways they make me throw it away, and didn't even ask nicely. She was so rude.   Anyways I love my buy one get one free boneless wings. So I ended up staying and honestly the wings were okay this time around because I know when there fresh and they took the time to prepare them properly.   This is by far the grossest part, I have no idea how long there carrots have been sitting back in the back I'm attaching a picture below. But honestly with all the E. coli crap going around the romaine lettuce seeing how gross these carrots looked made things much worse. I don't know if I'll ever be coming back to this location. Hopefully this gets to upper management this most definitely needs to be addressed"}
{"text":"I would give this place 1 Star if it wasn't for their server TOM! Tom is the best server in this whole place. Every other server has a bad attitude. The hostesses in the front will do anything to get you not to dine here. once they sent us away because they said they close at 10. It was like 9:15! That was ridiculous and I complained to the manager about the hostess and he proceeded to give me and my family a booth even though their dining area would be closing!! When our server is not TOM we always have a bad experience. They will bring out old soggy fries or not check on us. Once our waitress brought us 1 Ranch for 3 of us!! what the hell are we going to do with one ranch?? we called her out on it and she decided to argue with us and say they charge for each extra ranch. OK? and your point being? I think I can afford an extra ranch or two lady! Maybe she was stereotyping.. who knows? You have been warned ..."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at all these bad reviews, because we went the night of the Mayweather-Canelo fight and the food was good, the service was superior and they even had a Pick 'Em contest for the fight which I won first place of a $25 gift card!  (Secretly I gloated over picking who would win and when over all the men there.)  They called me like 3 days after the fight to tell me, so I guess they went thru all the sheets people turned in and then called.  It was a legitimate win anyway cause I know my boxing. Regardless, we had a waiter named Andy who looked like he had 4 tables assigned to him, and boy! did we have great service from him!  Left him a good tip for great service.  He was SO on the ball with everything we needed. By the way, they did pass out some samples of a stuffed mushroom for everyone, too. We ordered beers, of course, some queso and chips which was ok, and then some really good wings, and we are big wing people at my house so we kinda know our wings.  BWW had some good ones. This place is clean and cute, and the crowd was pretty decent too.  You never know how rough the crowd can be with boxing, but this was a nice looking decent crowd from the area alround here.  No problems at all, no fights, no scary people--just a nice, clean, decent crowd of family-type men and woman. We've gone to see another PPV fight at BWW in Tempe which is an older looking building but nice, also.   Maybe they have gotten the place more together since August, 2013, after these previous bad reviews, but I can honestly say we had fantastic service the night of the fight.  Boxing crowds can be rowdy, and they had the event so totally organized--even telling everyone at the door that they might have to sit strangers at your table if they got really crowded.  I have no idea how many others had a stranger at their table, but we had one guy put at our table to sit with us due to lack of seating and he was a peach of a guy.  We didn't care anyway cause we were there for the fight mainly and told them so. I wouldn't hesitate to go back to the BWW again for the next event.  Baseball is coming up, so I plan to use my $25 gift card at one of those PPV games.  This is a really clean, nice place so I really hope they have straightened out any kinks they had before...but it looks like they have to me if you go by the PPV event I attended.  We're going back for sure, cause it was a really enjoyable evening.  Update:  Again went there for the Pacquiao vs. Rios fight, and the service again was excellent.  A little bit slow getting things out of the kitchen but tolerable.   I can say that the wings--which I hate ordering anywhere cause half the time they aren't crispy and half-done--were cooked to perfection.  Even the person with me who graduated from the best culinary school in Chicago commented on how good they were.   I just don't get all the complaints during the week.  I wish the management would look into this before this place sinks, cause on fight nights the service is really super good."}
{"text":"The service is very good and the employees are very nice and get you what you need fast even when it's very busy."}
{"text":"BWW is always good on Tuesday . We always get the Spicy Garlic with a bit of the Mango Habanero. Don't forget about the wedges with cheese and bacon. Always in point. For the Men the screens are always on sports so you can not say you missed on any sports lol. Well peeps my food is here about to gobble these wings!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some coworkers. They have a great lunch special.  They also informed us that if our food wasn't out in 15 min then it would be free. Our food came out in 8 min. But it wasn't even close to being fresh. The fries were soggy and the wings were not hot. Kym our server checked on us once. We had to ask for refills. It was not busy at all. I would have rather waited longer for fresher food."}
{"text":"I am always looking for lunch places for me and my  International coworkers. I am a teacher at an Oncology training center down the street and we get an hour and a half for lunch. The food was great as usual, but the lunch service was too slow so we were late to get back to class. I feel like the servers should know or understand that lunch should be quick especially for business people that come in."}
{"text":"Used to like this place, but they can't handle heavy business. They made a mistake in an order that took one hour to get. By the time we got home and called regarding the mistake we were on hold for another 10 mins and had to drive all the way back just wait again for 20 mins. It took 2 1/2 hours just to get 5 pieces of wings. Literally. They should prepare staff ahead of time."}
{"text":"We just left this place after being seated by a guy who was less than friendly. After sitting for 5+ min, we asked the same guy for a manager as we had not been greeted by our server and the place was not crowded. The manager apologized and advised a server would be over soon. A few minutes later, she appeared. No greeting, no name, attitude etc. I didn't even realize she was our server. She was also a server that walked past us several times and made sure the bar customers behind us were taken care of. Again, we asked for the manager who apologized for the experience. Not sure what the issue was here today since they were not busy, but no worker seemed to want to be there today."}
{"text":"Oh my my my! Ok usually this bduds doesn't always do my tastebuds any justice, but today they did so well. If you're anything like me you are a spice head (as in the heat factor lol not the fake drugs)! I like my wings crispy and spicy. I ordered the mango habenro and hot bbq, all flat and extra crispy. Not chicken jerky tho. I find that if i don't get xtra crispy the wings come out undercooked! This place is ok for the location and always packed. If your looking to order over the phone.. Good luck. Overall ok food quality, not like the one on Craig and Commerce. Thats the best one."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner to watch the game. Numerous employees just stood around and watched the game rather than serving customers. I have worked at a BWW while in college at another location and this is the worst dining experience I've ever had. It was so hot in the restaurant my ice in my cup melted. I asked the server about it and he said I guess it's broke idk. We ordered drinks and it took 15 mins to get them. We ordered our food and it took 45 mins. Once the food was out to our table you could clearly tell it had been laying under the heaters for a long time. Extremely dry. We all asked for extra sauce and we finished our food before it came out. We reminded numerous times while eating about the sauce, his reply was dang, it's coming. Horrible experience, steer clear."}
{"text":"BW3 in Fairview Park is a Steelers bar which should be boycotted by the fans of all other teams. They will play the Steeler's games with volume every week in their back room. However, no longer will they play the volume for any other team when the Steelers are not playing. When asked, I was told it is because they are turning away Brown's fans from their restaurant when Brown's fans can not sit in the main room and the bar area, and want to listen to and watch the Browns play. That makes sense, but then why when the Steelers play do you turn away Brown's fans that no longer can get a seat in the main room,or bar area and want to watch and listen to the Brown's game?  The service is good. The food is over priced. The large screen TVs are aging."}
{"text":"Our quoted wait was 40 minutes, we waited well over an hour and I swear people who came in after were seated before my giant party of 2! I did not make a big stink, but I did notice that there was a birthday party for one of their regulars... this meant it took my server 10mins to even acknowledge us, another 10 for them to bring our drinks and once we got our food she literally came by 2 times... It could've been because she was singing happy birthday to said regular, or perhaps it was because she was snacking on the food the birthday man had. Either way it was hella rude and quite irritating. On top of it all, she was hella rude to us. Sometimes, people work 9 hours, come home to their child and decide they do not want to cook.... this is what I get for not cooking at home like normal.  I will not be going back to this location.   Servers eating off patrons plates and sitting on their laps like a bunch of thotties is no bueno!  No yay!"}
{"text":"Oh lordy.  Now normally I LOVE BWW, this time not so much! we went in and it was semi busy, we were seated and our waitress came and took our order for drinks. My son was sick and kept telling her he didnt want anything to drink and she was like \"are you sure?\" then started naming all kinds of drinks. He of course said no and then finally agreed to try some cranberry juice. It arrived from the bar in a cocktail glass, which was dirty, and he tried it and said no. So she pressed on... he finally agreed to chocolate milk, which I didnt want him to have since he had strep but whatever he didnt have but 1 drink.  We ordered boneless wings, I ordered my fave mango habanero, honey bbq, and Caribbean jerk. My son ordered mac and cheese, but again he didnt eat it! My wings came out and I was not impressed at all! The wings tasted funny and the sauces were like thick and yucky. The breading on the wings was all wrong, idk what was up with them that day but I seriously couldnt eat them. My honey bbq was nasty as was the carribean jerk, so I asked for more mango habanero  and she brought me out bone in ones... ahh! I was like in my tiny voice \"I'm sorry, but I wanted boneless ones : (\" she looked at me and was like well do you just want these instead? No miss lady, I want boneless, pwease! It doesnt matter these tasted like shat as well!  Our waitress was super crummy, she kept talking to this one table and wouldnt come and get us water or anything. Not until the very end when we were all irritated and ready to go she asked if we needed any water or refills on wings. Ugh! Oh well, I'm nice and tipped her because thats how I roll!  Maybe it'll be better next time!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was HORRIBLE. They also basically stole money from me.   We went in and got seated pretty quickly, it was 3rd quarter in a game so I figured the food wouldnt take forever... I was wrong! The waiter was initially good but quickly started to suck. He brought out our food and never brought us silverware or  ranch. I flagged him down 20 mins later, and his response was that \" I keep forgetting I have a table back here\" my son was sooo hungry he started eating with his hands! He ended up bring out fresh food and silverware.. FINALLY.  Our bill came and I asked if he could take off a meal since it took FOREVER and he went and asked. He came back and told me that his manager took off our to go order and that he would comp our appetizer. He then said \"your bill will BE LIKE 23$\" I gave him two 20$ bills and he was off. I could tell he didnt know how much change to give me but he brought it back and quickly walked away. Inside I found 7$!!! 7$!! OK our bill was initially 31$, I shouldve got back 9$ but since he took off and comped me it SHOULDVE been  A LOT CHEAPER. From my calculations, he took off 10$ for the to go and 5$ for the app, that would only be a 16$ bill. I figured ehe really didnt cover the app, which is why it was 23$  I spoke to the GM and he was freakin oblivious, and offered me a 25$ food credit. I was sooo pissed, the waiter basically jipped me for 17$!!! The managers response was that he couldnt do anything about it... so hes letting his employee STEAL MONEY FROM A CUSTOMER? At this point I was soooo mad I wanted to cry, I ended up leaving and telling him to teach his employees basic math. I called the next day to speak to another manager, who was not helpful, and he said the GM I spoke to was higher up and I was welcomed to come and talk to him... OK, I live on the other side of Summerlin?! I'm not driving AGAIN over there to get something fixed that shouldve been fixed LAST NIGHT.   I have not went back for my \"food credit\" I did e-mail bww customer service but they suck horribly and have never e-mailed me back. I really wished the waiter wouldve given me a receipt, but of course he didnt bc he didnt wanna show how he stole money from me.  Freakin jerks! I wish I could give no stars!"}
{"text":"Oh, Buffalo Wild Wings, you lost a star with me last night. So... I order a buffalo ranch chicken wrap. Buffalo Ranch. Chicken Wrap. Ok. Clarified with the waitress that I wanted medium sauce (which comes on it) and chips and salsa. Cool. Easy. Apparently not. The waitress brought out a sauce-less buffalo chicken wrap. When I brought it to her attention, she simply stated, \"yeah, I know. they mixed yours up with one in the back.\" She knowingly brought out the incorrect order then stupidly admitted to knowing it was wrong. WHO DOES THAT? Then walked away--completely unconcerned.   Now it's time to pay our bills. After taking 20 minutes to come back to the table, we have our cards out waiting for her to bring us the tab. Right in front of her we put the cards in the holder, and go to hand them to her, and she just walks off...once again completely aloof. We then wait another 15 minutes for her to cash us out (I should also mention its 11pm on a Tuesday and there are literally 8 people in the whole place). Finally we get so tired of waiting, and walk our bills up to the counter.   Honestly, this place deserves 1 star. The staff (for the most part) are visually displeasing, unfriendly, and God-awful bartenders. The only reason it is getting two stars is because when I do get the sauce I order on my wraps, it's pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Just like any other Buffalo Wild Wings place, but add more air conditioning vents! It was a tad warm around the area I was seated."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I've had at a valley restaurant in years. The manager must be trying to save money on the electric bill this week as the indoor ambient temp is a very uncomfortable 87 degrees tonight. Wings were decent enough to earn two stars. Probably won't be back to this Chandler mall location again"}
{"text":"Kids were screaming for this place...I assume it was because of the tablets they give you with your food.  I thought they were free....but Noooooooooo....$1.29 each to activate them.  That made me sigh.  Kids meals were average and portion sizes were good.  Best thing about this place?  It is next to my favorite, Rita's."}
{"text":"This place was fast and terrible! We as customers don't want to be rushed... Krystina was very rude. They said it was last call at 10:30pm but closed at 11:00pm  We got to-go boxes and left just to find better service.  Unfortunate cause the place has potential, management has to get serious with their employees.  Absolutely terrible experience in so many ways   Fuck you guys"}
{"text":"People who go to buffalo wild wings and not try their Asian zing wings are making a mistake. \"Hott\", \"medium\", and \"mild\" wings are pretty much a commodity these days, but not the Asian zing wings. I have been to plenty of places that try to copy the flavor and they have ALL yet to.   I pretty much go to bww just for these wings. There happy hour specials don't seem to pack as much of a punch as they used to. Beer selection is OK, but nothing special. It would be nice to see some IPA selections!  Overall though, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Asian zing! I love these wings. They are so unique and I haven't ever had any that are like them. I have been to a couple of places that have tried to copy the asian zing and they were OK, but not like the real McCoy! Ranch + Asian Zings = Awesome!  I think that their other wings are just like any other wings, so, Asian Zings are the only reason why I really like this place.   Personally, I think Zipps wings have more meat and are also great, so, I spend my time at both places. I'm not complaining though."}
{"text":"Have never had anything but good experiences at buffalo wild wings but this was less than subpar. Chicken was hard to chew and under sauced. Fries tasted as if someone had done a lazy job of reheating leftovers in the microwave. Bland and undercooked overall. Server was rushing us the entire time and made us feel inconvenienced anytime we needed something. The nachos were very good the only good part of the meal."}
{"text":"My 1st time at any BWW. I wanted to try a sampling of their sauces.I ordered 24 wings. Honey BBQ, Asian garlic, parmesan, mango. They were OK. The sauces, to me, seem very salty. They do taste great though. The wings are small, so don't go there expecting to have HUGE chicken wings. I got my order to go, so I was only in there for about 10 minutes. It was dead (Monday night). Tons of TV's and loud music - proably great to watch a game there."}
{"text":"would've been a 4-star if they didnt muck up my takeout order   definitely a 4-star for action & marketing, it sure is a place to hang or watch a sports game, especially if one doesnt like the loungey/pubs.   they're quite spacious, bright, almost Olive Garden-like, without the family atmoshpere lol     Was supposed to get 5 each of spicy garlic, parmesan garlic & lemon pepper, but instead, got all hot wings. for once, I let my guard down, thats what happens being on another holidays & midnite, my mind wasnt clear: I almost always double-check after studying this industry lol     too hungry to complain. yet can say the crunchiness of the skin was good, breaded.   boneless meat surprisingly better, again, wrong order as a true wing man loves the bones lol.  certainly will come back to give another try.  it's a bit off the strip, around the Walgreens/Mcdonalds corner.  nice touch with the branded hand wet naps.  yeah, a 4 for marketing for sure."}
{"text":"I really like their boneless wings and the service at lunch is pretty good and quick enough. That's why it's three stars.  Be warned...If you come here when it's busy, you'll receive awful service. It's slow, spotty (at best), and you'll end up asking for a ton of stuff that's just basic restaurant stuff. This location in particular is slow as hell when it's busy.   Thursdays are a great day to go, because of the 60 cent boneless wings. As for their wings, I like a lot of their sauces, especially the mango habenero and honey BBQ. It is a really good place to watch a game, and the crowd can be fun sometimes (when not overrun with college frat douches), so BWW has that going for it.  Will I be back? Yes. Will I attempt to avoid it during evenings and weekends? Absolutely."}
{"text":"My waiter was awesome although the food was very disappointing, my lemon pepper wings seemed as if someone carelessly just tossed some seasonings on top of them. My hot wings still had some spots that weren't even covered with the hot sauce and I had to ask for dipping sauce to dip the barbecue wings in although my waiter was wonderful I will not be returning ever again."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon (not football season!) and were seated right away.   The service was great and our food was quick to be delivered. It was very tasty and affordable.  The restaurant had on four different baseball games and also had the trivia game on the Air."}
{"text":"Server was nice..but food took wayyy too long. We were there for two hours! Got two cokes an app and 2 orders of wings. Table was sticky also"}
{"text":"Wings are great for every occasion.  I love this place but if a girl name Ashley takes your order over the phone it makes your experience rocky.  She definitely needs to work on her language skills with customers.  All you get is an irritating tone the whole time she is taking your order.  If you dine in it's great!!! If you order take out, I hope you get a better customer service experience then what I received."}
{"text":"Just experienced the best lunch ever. My five year old chose BW3's for her birthday lunch today. We told our waiter (Mike) that it was her birthday lunch.Ten minutes later he comes back from the Dollar Store with a bouquet of balloons and a pink AND a white teddy bear (bc he couldn't decide). I had tears in my eyes -it was the most thoughtful gesture anyone has ever done. He also gave her free ice cream and cake. What an amazing man! He made my little girl's birthday so special. After posting about this experience on FB - this man must make a lot of people's day, bc many people knew of him and said was a great man/waiter he is. Management needs to recognize him for making eating here such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Popped into the location on Dundas St West (no yelp page approved for it as yet)... on a holiday Monday night & was surprised to find them open after 10 (not a lot of places were)....so glad we didn't have to resort to drive thru or get turned off by the reviews of their other locations. That location was great!! Pretty typical sports bar decor/flat screens/booths, etc but not overcrowded arranged seating space like most others (and doesn't turn into a nightclub-like space after 10 either!!)   Typical american fare amped up with build your own burger, customize your wing sauce... Our server was great & let us try a few of the sauces before we ordered so that helped narrow our choices down.   Both the chicken wings & boneless wings were delish! Wide selection of sauces .... We tried Asian zing, parmesan garlic, honey bbq, fiery honey garlic (ranch/blue cheese standard on the side as well of course). Parmesan garlic was the only one that didn't cut it.   We started with the mozza sticks which were yum - freshly made & not overdone, too chewy or frozen like some places. They were also on special for late night \"happy hour\" (along with some other apps & beers)  We sat in the dining area (bar area on the other half) & still had many tv's with various channels on... While we waited for our order, the server brought us game controller thingys for the on screen games (trivia/poker etc). That was awesome!!! It didn't take very long to get our food so we played the trivia together during our meal as well :-)  The blondie sponge cake dessert was also tasty...a la mode!  No complaints, will back:-)  it's also located in a plaza that's right across from the Cineplex complex so great date night spot & good for hanging out with friends!!"}
{"text":"I can't rate this place on food, due to losing my appetite while sitting at the bar. My friend and I went for a drink and our experience wasn't good!   First we sat down and our bartender was sweet, but she wasn't up to date with her knowledge on their wine or beer. I ordered the Dark Horse Cabernet after debating on what I was drinking for a good 10 min, the bartender said she didn't have it. THEN my friend went to order the Black Panther Stout I believe after she took forever to decide as well, and the bartender poured her an Amber ale, thinking we didn't know our beers. I told her that what she poured was not a stout, and she said \"Oh, sorry, we don't have that anymore.\" REALLY? I won't mention her name because I'm not trying to get someone fired or in trouble. But TELL the customers what you're out of before they sit there and read the menu. Common sense sister.   So on top of those two things, we can see in the server station, and one of the servers is blowing his nose, right in front of the customers! I nearly threw up!  I would never eat there after that experience!   Your company really needs to get it together! I wouldn't return unless I ordered a bottled beer and to watch a football game!"}
{"text":"3 small pretzels for $8 oookay. Customer service was great the chicken was delicious as far as our pretzels went it was more like whatttt are thoseeeee."}
{"text":"Excellent place to watch a game while you have some drinks, good wings and good service. Wish they wood comp more drinks while you gamble but it usually depends on how well the bartender likes you. Either way love going here for games, usually some kind of drink/appetizer special...and big fan of the spicy garlic sauce!!! Nom Nom Nom!"}
{"text":"Bw3 is a chain so I'm not going to comment on the food. It's wings. But a few comments:  Positives: a non-smoking bar! In Las Vegas! Also, generally able to accommodate game requests since there are so many TVs.  Negative: the servers are typically on their game, but if you sit at the bar there's a 50-50 chance you'll be served (or even greeted for that matter) in a timely manner.  I wouldn't say \"go somewhere else\"...it's a good sports bar. Just don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 5 stars, our waitress was a very friendly woman she did however ask the 4 year old in our party if he wanted a tablet instead of asking the adults if it was okay. There seemed to be a lot of miscommunication between us and our waitress. We waited a long time for ranch and refills. The appetizer we ordered came out with our meal which was off putting. Other than that the veterans special was pretty cool. You're welcome for my service Buffalo Wild Wings"}
{"text":"I don't understand why management can't keep beer in stock at this place. This is a 24/7 town and beer distributors are more than happy to restock their product any time.  Pathetic."}
{"text":"Hi my name is Roxy and I am a hot wing addict. I get it, I am a petite, blonde haired female. Typically that and hot wings don't go together. My mother would disown me if she knew that her only daughter ate with her hands, goes through more napkins and ranch dressing than any female ever should and joined what is supposed to be a boys only club. But don't fret mother, I still can't drink a beer, all hope isn't lost!  So being the wing addict that I am, I have searched high and low for wings - and I frankly really hate to admit this, but Buffalo Wild Wings has some legit good chicken wings.... besides they have more flavors than a Baskin Robbins.  Besides, they have every game on known to man and a huge selection of beer (which is ahem every mans dream), the place is super kid friendly and they have great cocktails to drown away any pain and torture your wife, girlfriend, secret girlfriend, want her to be your girlfriend is enduring by being forced to watch professional sports.  But for me... Really it's simple - I come for the wings!"}
{"text":"We showed up at 1 am and Ambakey was amazing!! Deserves a raise to be working these shifts. Favorite server so far. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Ample parking.  Great location.  In & Out with no real wait.  Honored a birthday coupon that was marked for Wisconsin but it's BW3.  Treated the kid with mucho respect.  Thanked us for the visit.  Next door to the Cheesecake place and Sleep number store is one over.  Across the way from the Northlake Mall, Target and a good mix of chain places to run errands or hang out."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to give them a star but what they're worth is a negative star. Sat there for 30 minutes got walked by, looked straight in the eye, and passed multiple times by waiters. After seating ourselves we were finally asked 10 minutes later for our drink order. We were then told twice they would return to take our food order. We moved from the bar area to the dining area thinking it might be better but nope were we wrong. Needless to say we are at Chili's right down the street and have are drinks and food ordered and appetizers on the table. The employees should come get some training at Chili's. Basically what I'm saying is Buffalo Wild Wings waiters, if you want to call them that, can suck my ****"}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. I waited at least hour and a half for my food to come out.  Very slow and a waste of money. Not recommended at all, you can get so smuch better food and at a cheaper price somewhere else:("}
{"text":"For what you're looking for, it gives you what you would expect! The cheese curds were delicious, the wings were great. I got Parmesan garlic and mild. Was there during 4pm on a Sunday so service overall was fast! Would recommend if you are craving chicken wings!"}
{"text":"Service service service! Ray the bartender not only pours a mean black and tan but really impressed me with his service style and attitude. Always promptly greeted and never feel rushed to order or forgotten. Tough task for a lot of bartenders.   Ordered my usual, wings 'drums' only (first wing section that looks like a drumstick)  no extra charge and more meat and less mess. Everything came out correctly as usual.   Been coming here since it opened, this was the mayo location that moved years ago. Consistent wings, love the mango habanero sauce. Try their special pricing on Tuesdays and Thursdays."}
{"text":"I came here last week and got some wings. They were dry and slightly burnt.  I normally love buffalo wild wings but it seem like they had a lot of issues that night. The cashier didn't know how to count my change back to me and the Mgr had to come over and show her. I was waiting for a good ten min. I definitely won't be going back there"}
{"text":"Don't go here for lunch on a weekday if you have any kind of a time constraint. Their service and kitchen is sooooo slow, even though the lunch crowd is light. Chips and salsa with a small salad took 30 minutes. Only 6 other occupied tables in the whole restaurant. And this wasn't just a single event. It's the same story the last four times I've been here."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with BWW!! Great place to catch a game and maybe a few brews. Lemmon pepper, spicy garlic, and hot are the trio of flavors from a variety of flavors they offer!! With all the screens set up around the room there's no game you can miss!!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere- great food!!!  Bri is the best server!!!   Can't wait to watch football here!  Very easy going & accommodating!!!"}
{"text":"UFC fights for free...get here about 5-6p to get a seats for mediocre fight cards, for big fight cards like with Jon Bones Jones or Spider Silva you need to be here about 4-430 for a good seat. Service is always good......"}
{"text":"RANT:  We just moved to PGH from FL & decided to try B-Dubbs. It was a Wed nite, no games were going on, fairly quiet evening.   From the time we were seated until the time a server approached the table was 14 mins. She stated she wasn't our server but will take our drink order. Another 8 mins passed when Angela N. came over with those drinks that we had ordered from the first server.  Angela took our order & served us. She never came back to  (a) ask us how our meal is or if we needed anything (I needed condiments for my burger)  (b) offer a refill on our teas or water (we had spicy sauce & were parched) and  (c) bring our check.  Instead, we had to ask two passing servers for condiments, napkins, drink refills  & our check. That was 4 requests to 2 other servers. My spouse & I consider ourselves to be great tippers as we eat out alot. We would never stiff a server, however, we were compelled to give the other two servers Angela's tip. Angela only got 10%.  Needless to say, we were highly disappointed in the service as the restaurant was not busy & seemed fully staffed. The other 2 servers were friendly & accommodating.  The Jax, FL and Fort Walton Beach, FL B-Dubbs were great. However we will not go to store #0302 again because of the poor service."}
{"text":"I always love BWs atmospheres, will he and beer specials.  Great service when we have been.  Downside uptown no parking :("}
{"text":"If you have children please, please stay away from this location. This is my second review of this location-just a heads up. We went there tonight, a Sunday night, no game, no activites and we had the worst service imaginable. We sat in the patio and asked three waitresses after 15 minutes who our server was because we had our 3 year old with us. No one knew. When we were getting ready to get up to leave to another restaurant another patron said he would ask his waitress, he did and she served us. It was not her section and she was new, fine, we appreciated that. She didn't know what was on draft but it did not matter since we were hungry and thirsty. After another 15 minutes she brought out the wrong beer order. After another 15 minutes our food came but not our childs. We asked the server and they said we never put it in, whatever. So we ordered again. While we were waiting someone who was a manager type but did not introduce themseleves that way, came and said they would rush the order but never said sorry! The waitress came back and apologized but we said our distress was the fact that our daughter had no food! The waitress left and came back 5 minutes later saying that our daughters food would be comp'd. Not anything else! We were given the wrong beer, waited way to long for service, saw 3 waitresses that would NOT even help us, and the manager type never said sorry! What a joke! As we were leaving the patron that helped get us a waitress told us he was sorry that we encountered that with our family! We left hungry because they never came and asked us if we wanted anything else! This honestly has been the worst service I have been given in the valley and there was no excuse since they were not even busy! I get that staff might be new but with all the other challenges it was a total waste! We should have just left and ate some place else. STAY AWAY! I will never eat at this location again! I will go back to Goodyear or Surprise where their costumer service is INCREDIBLY better, what a let down."}
{"text":"Always a great time when you go here! On Wednesdays kids meals are a $1.99 which is great! The only reason I can't give 5 stars is the popcorn shrimp was overcooked this time. But in the past they made it amazing!"}
{"text":"Food is good- I love their wings and they were out fast and hot. BUT their service is awful... And has been every time we've been here. It takes forever for someone to come check on you, drinks take forever, and just overall lagging.  I know they're busy- it's MNF, and I love the place, so I hope for better experiences in the future."}
{"text":"This place is great to watch a game!! There are TVs everywhere!  The service is usually great and you cant beat their wings.  For Madison I feel that they are on the pricier side but I guess you are also paying for the space; it's huge!!  BBW has great wings!! And they are also introducing limited time wing sauces that I'm always excited to try!"}
{"text":"Dope ... Place to come for wings and watch the game the staff are nice too.. Bring some friends and watch the games so check this out my yelpers..."}
{"text":"When we came here we walked in and stood at the host stand and waited for about 3-5 mins before anyone came to ask us to be seated. It was not busy at all either. We then got sat and then waited awhile for a server to come and take our order. We got our drinks and fried cheese right away, then seemed to wait forever for our meals! Our server had friends sitting behind and continued to go and stand or sit and talk to them. Laughing and talking really loud about her plans that night and how she couldn't hang out, because she was going to work the WWE event. Our food finally came and she came back once to check on us and ask if we'd like anything else. We asked for our check, then had to walk around to find her.  I wasn't impressed with the server, my food was ok, and I felt it was freezing in there! The best part of course was watching the World Cup Soccer matches. Nice selection of tvs.  Would I come back, yeah, for the tvs and maybe to just get some drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Not sure why this BWs has poor reviews. Typical BWs food which is good. Lots of tvs and Sunday Ticket. Great service from Tiffany. Very attentive and friendly.   Okay, this is my second visit and I feel I need to update my review. Today I'm in a booth by a window. And I am constantly being bombarded by flies! I bet there are less flies on the patio!  And I switched the flavor of my soda after a refill, and the waitress charged me twice! Obviously Tiffany isn't my waitress today and what a difference that is."}
{"text":"I have been here several times but unfortunately this time has me questioning whether I will return or not. It was very slow not many customers when I arrived. Our server was pleasant but slow. There is nothing worse than a server who choses not to write your order down because they \"think\" they will remember it. Needless to say, I had to request the same drink more than once because she forgot. After ordering our wings we waited about 20 min before it arrived (need I remind you we were 1 of about 5 customers in the restaurant). The wings were so dry I had to request an extra side of sauce just to fully coat them. Overall, not the best experience. But if you are inclined to visit this particular location perhaps wait until the evening when they actually pay attention to their customers."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I LOVE chicken wings. They are one of my 5 major food groups. So its only natural that I visit this establishment VERY often. However, I will NEVER be returning after my experience over the past week. The other night my fiance and I went in for some late night wings and drinks. I said I would pay for food, and he would pay for drinks. I paid cash, he paid on his card. The next day we realized they had charged his card twice, for the drinks and food. I called them up with both reciepts ready and explained my problem. The manager said that only the drink charge would post and if there was any problems I could call back. Well when the wrong charge posted, I called back and he said there was nothing he could do. He was rude to me about it, unapologetic and made no offer to make it right to me. I have worked in the restaurant business and I have NEVER seen that. Usually when a restaurant makes a mistake they not only make it right, but they usually offer you something for the inconvenience. All this manager did was pretty much say oh well, sucks to be you. Lets just say, I'll be getting my chicken wing fix elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"I've been here for several UFC fights and basketball games and it has always been good. Attentive staff who made sure we had good seats and the TVs near us had what we requested which isn't hard because there are TVs everywhere. I prefer the second floor seating. Food came out hot and quick and my glass was never empty.  The place is clean and the staff is friendly. I use to go to a different Bdubs but it went downhill plus they stopped showing the fights so this was my first shot at a replacement. Happy to say it meets my needs.    Good picks off the menu are the boneless wings (I like Spicy Garlic, Caribbean Jerk, Hot BBQ, Asian Zing and Parmesan Garlic Sauces), Black and Blue Burger, Buffolitos, Steak Wrap, Ultimate Nachos, Onion Rings and Fried Mushrooms.  Craft beer selection isn't the best but it isn't terrible either. There is usually something of interest to me."}
{"text":"My wife is a flight attendant and when she hits the sky I bring my daughter's to BWW to soften the blow. We always go to Luis he knows what we get every time."}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss when coming here. There will be no customers and service will be terrible or the place will be packed and service will be great. Our service today was good, all the food tasted great. The soft pretzels are my must have choice that I get every time here!"}
{"text":"Shoutout to my boy Solomon. Provided some friendly customer service and some great food. Highly recommend going to my boy Solomon."}
{"text":"Just had the boneless mango habenaro wings and boy were they hot!! They where excellent. The recent remodel looks great and management looked very attentive. I will be coming back often. I recommend sitting in the bar area in Moniques section. Great server."}
{"text":"Great food! Jessica is the best she always remembers I want oranges instead of lemons with my agave wheat beer!!"}
{"text":"This BWW is what you would expect to find near a college town. Young kids (workers) not giving a damn, screwing around, whipping each other with towels ( literally). Our waiter was very nice but once we placed our order he was MIA. We had to ask for drink refills, napkins, and our bill. Food was good but the place was messy.  this place off my list. Date of visit 3-20-16"}
{"text":"I generally like BW's I'm a sucker for the mango habenero.  I like that they have kids night on Wednesday but the service seems to be lousy even for a sports bar.  The kicker is that last time we went they didn't have trivia!  Part of the reason we go is to play trivia against each other.  The drinks are yummy, but overpriced for the amount of actual booze you are getting in their mixed drinks."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to write a review for BW3s since we ended up not dining there the evening we stopped in, but I felt compelled to warn others about special event nights there.   We happened to swing by for a birthday gathering when we were informed of the special event night for boxing. The price was going to be $10 a person whether you were watching or not. I get that, and we all understood and then promptly stepped to the side to discuss another place to go.  However, I was extremely dumbfounded when a couple walked in with their infant baby...INFANT BABY and were told the total cost for them to watch the event would be $30 ($10/ea). They seriously *charged* for the INFANT BABY!! Ridiculous. Makes me sad because I really heart BW3s most of the time."}
{"text":"I'm sitting right now waiting for my food starving and all of the servers Danielle and Tiffany are literally sitting 2 tables away from us eating... Like maybe our food isn't ready yet and you need to eat lunch but there's a whole part of the restaurant that's not being used. That's just common courtesy."}
{"text":"The food is okay and I'd actually give 3 or 4 stars if their service wasn't absolutely dreadful every time I come in!   The first 2 or 3 times I went, I had to wait forever for the server to take our drink order. Then I had to wait maybe 10-15 minutes to get the drinks, and then wait like another 25-30 minutes for our food. I thought maybe its just cause its a little busy? The next couple times I had exactly the same experience, only it was not busy at all!!!   Their servers takes forever to greet us and take our drinks. Once they give us our drinks, they just leave right away so then we have to wait for them to return and take our actual order, which means we have to wait even longer for the food.  I'll probably stick to the Westgate location seeing as how this location's service completely sucks!"}
{"text":"Ate at this location this past Monday night. I honestly did not expect much because of previous experiences at other locations. We had a group of 7 which all of us completely understand we would have a bit of a wait due to a larger party. We noticed they did have several parties waiting that had arrived before us. I was standing on the left side of the resturant and counted 13 tables unoccupied just on the left side of the resturant. Who knows how many were open on the opposite side. After an hour wait, they proceeded to seat half of our party at one table and the other half diagonally across the way. seriously? We asked several times if we were able to combine the tables but I never heard a legitimate excuse as to why not. But the worse part is, after about 5 minutes being sat the hostesses push two tables right next to ours together to seat a larger group but only 3 of there party was present! After finally ordering our table recieved our food pretty quick but the other half of our party received their food about 15 minuted after us. And we had the same waiter! The food is middocure even when drunk!! Which is saying alot!!   Like I originally said I didnt expect much but c'mon this place is directly on the strip, step it up!"}
{"text":"Putting a \"waiter\" on blast called EDGAR. Had to wait 10+ min just to get our order taken. Then when we wanted a refill , he took his sweet time and got out drink wrong. This is the second time we had him as our server and both times dissatisfying. Milkshake was good"}
{"text":"The staff were really friendly and good about topping off my drink. Not too packed for a Saturday night and the layout was one of the better ones I have been in. Very clean too.  Other than that, just your standard Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"The main reason we head to \"Wings\" (as we nicknamed it), is the friendly service.  The servers are outgoing and make you feel at home.  We love to watch the Vegas Golden Knights, our new NHL team, on the big screen TVs while dining on our favorite chicken wings, fries, and appetizers.  Prices are great, especially if you catch a night when they have a wing special.  Sometimes I go in a healthier mood and have myself a grilled chicken salad.  My favorite appetizer is the spinach artichoke dip, which you can order with tortilla chips or pita bread.  Parking is close and plenty!"}
{"text":"This location SUCKS! I went on a Thursday, got 15 boneless spicy garlic with fries & a bottle of spicy garlic with the 5$ off coupon. Paid about 13.00 all together.   Strike 1: for 2.79 They skimp on the fries!! I can get more fries at McDs for 2.00 Strike 2:  some of my wings didn't even have meat! Just hard bread. And they were lukewarm when I got them, which means they were under the lamp til I ordered them, then they slapped some sauce on them really quick! Strike 3: NO RANCH! I went back inside after looking in my bag and didn't see any, and they charge .60 per small cup. SERIOUSLY?? I know a lot of other places that serve better wings and don't nickel and dime you like this place does. Also they have crappy service and dirty tables.  Skip this place & go to Timbers!"}
{"text":"If I can give this restaurant zero stars I would. I have been coming here for years. And this time, was the worst experience I have ever had! We walked in to be seated at 7:40pm. The server told us that it was going to be a 20 minute wait. So we are waiting and at this point about 7 other parties came in to be seated. She sat every other party down and made us wait almost an hour. My husband called the manager to complain because she sat a party that arrived after we did in a table where we would of been accommodated and all he said was there is nothing I can do man, and he walked away. No apology, no attempt to have us seated.  We got seated at around 8:20, at this point I'm furious because of the lack of service. Then they don't come to take our order until 8:45. So we get our order in about 30 mins later. At this point I just knew I would never bring my business here again. We got our food and our chicken wings are raw!!!! RAW! I call the server. And she goes, ok so what do you want! And I just starred at her and was like just bring more wings! She brings us 3 more wings. Expecting this to compensate the fact that it was raw and I would have made a huge scene since poultry is suppose to be 100% cooked.  We are half way done with our food and my sister in law had ordered a burger and they didn't bring that out. We had to tell the server 3 times and when he did he brought it out cold. We finished our food and we left. We left the restaurant at 10pm. I am so upset at the service and I will. It be coming back. My bill was $110 and if I'm spending this much I expect good service."}
{"text":"Came on Tuesday night for World Series baseball, Felicia the bartender gave great service and we will back for more sporting games!"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing, but the service generally is only so-so.  When it comes to refilling your drinks or getting a side of ranch it can be hard to find your server. But then again the times I've gone have been the weekends when the place is packed, so I'd like to think the servers are just overloaded!"}
{"text":"Love BWW at Steele Creek. The staff is great. The food doesn't always come out consistently, but we generally like it all and have a great time playing trivia."}
{"text":"Visited this location last week. The food at BWW is always adequate and enjoyable, and the service is generally typical of a bar, however, this evening the service was the worst I've ever encountered at a restaurant. It was so bad I had time to write an email on the corporate website while waiting on the server.  As I said, since the service is generally mediocre at best, this particular evening sent me over the edge and I will never return. A few days later I went to a different location on Elliot/McQueen and it was a complete 180 on service (the food was good as usual), I have since returned once, and will leave them a positive review....Paige was a delight as our waitress."}
{"text":"Visited this location after an atrocious experience with service at the location on Gilbert road (a location I will never visit again).  My groups server, Paige, was incredibly friendly and efficient and maintained good table presence without being over bearing. The food was good, as expected from BWW (my favorite place to get wings).   Overall it was an pleasant experience and I have already returned once, and I will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Lively place good beer great staff and yummy food! Had a Italian Burger w/ mozzarella sticks, pepperoni and marinara sauce on the it! MMM MMm Mmm..."}
{"text":"Fun place to go with friends, has a decent amount of options for vegetarians such as myself. And the bar is open 24 hours which is nice! Good place to grab a beer and hangout."}
{"text":"Love BWW but not this location!!!the wait was ridiculous and the waiting area is too small, very crammed. Slow, hostess doesn't seat you regardless if there is three of them standing at the podium, they just point in the general direction to where you need to sit. Our servers switched in the middle of our order and it wasn't because one was ending her shift. Our order took a little too long but whatever. Our order comes out, they mess up my boyfriends order and bring the naked chicken tenders when he ordered the regular chicken tenders. Our water had  still not been brought to us at this point, we had to request them again after our meal had arrived. They failed to have our dipping sauces out that we requested with our meal. Just a pain in the ass experience. Won't be returning here to this location. Should have stuck to our gut and went to good 'ol Yardhouse."}
{"text":"The only thing good I have to say about my last experience was that the remodel looks nice. I walked in to pick up a to go order, the two girls at the counter did not smile once, not even a thank you after they took my money... Not sure why I tipped them. Probably due to my serving and bartending experience. Anyway, I sat down to wait for my order, and started paying attention to how other customers were being treated. It being Boneless Thursday, the place was pretty full. As groups came in, the hostess would look around with a blank stare and say \"uhhhhh the dining room is full right now...\" Not offer them a wait time, or check if there was room in the bar. The manager was at the front at one time too, also with a blank stare but not even talking to customers. To top it all off, when I got home with my order, the wings were not even all the way covered in sauce. Weeeeeeeak."}
{"text":"Worst management. And yucky foods. And service was bad too.   I will never suggest this place. Dont go."}
{"text":"No longer will I go to bww, unless it is for take out. I don't think I've ever had good customer service at this location ever in all honesty. My most recent experience truly was the straw that broke the camels back.  Boyfriend and I show up around midnight and sit at the bar top. We don't particularly enjoy dining at the bar, but we've always gotten horrible service at the high tops. We thought we might get a bit better service this time since you know, we're literally in front of the bar tender the entire time. We were wrong.  It took 10 minutes for the bar tender to ask if we wanted drinks, another 10 minutes for him to come back and take our order, and another 35 for our food (snack size wings, an onion ring and a quesadilla). This always seems to be the case: poor service, slow kitchen, and a lack of regard for the customers who essentially pay their rent.   Buffalo Wild Wings will never provide good service, because they know their wing Tuesday and Thursday's will always bring people in. We have decided never to dine in this establishment again because they truly can't even be bothered to serve their guests. Very unfortunate such tasty food has such horrible staff members."}
{"text":"So hockey season is back, and we have started out this season great. We ended up getting taken care of Tony, who covered for a waitress (also doing a great job with her tables). The staff here is always so personable, the food is always done right, and we're going to be coming back a lot this season...    The only thing I have less than positive to say is that your reward points expire. Apparently season to season is too long to go, but the manager took care of us in the end..."}
{"text":"Fast service good food. They had 3 employees standing around not doing any work. That would be my only problem with this place. I like to see employees busy with every work place. I sure will return when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I am really hooked on the Ultimate Nachos right now. It keeps me coming back again and again. The only fault of this restaurant is how they handle Sundays. I came with my Mom (from New Orleans) to this location in Phoenix, AZ  on Sunday around noon to watch the end of the Saints game. The hostess says it will be over an hour to seat us. 2 people. Just 2 people. Well we stayed because we could watch the game while waiting by hostess station. I do credit a waitress, who suggested to us the tables outside (weather here was cool that day). We took the offer and enjoyed the Saints-Bears game with our food until it was over. Thanks BW3."}
{"text":"Yes, another themed sports bar/ restaurant here in Vegas... But, the BWW location gets the 4th star for the employees & service! We don't stop by nearly as much as I would like... love the wing sauce here! However, when we do, we have never had a bad experience.   They usually have a great selection... All the normal lagers that most here seem to like, plus a few craft beers for us who like flavor. The wings are wings, it is the choices of sauce that make the wings special. But, again, the service here just seems to be the high point."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is with this place.  1st and last time visiting one."}
{"text":"Although it may be too early to actually give this place a rating, I can adjust it later. We went yesterday for wings and it is only their second day working. This is actually more of a 3 star restaurant but obviously you know what your getting into when going to a BWW. Our table had 4 people and for how busy they were, to only miss a couple of items on our table was really no big deal. They were quick to apologize and bring us our correct food, and that's all you can expect.  There were no games on by the time we arrived, but I can tell this is going to be a great spot to catch some games. HUGE 70 inch plasma LCD's and a large 100 inch projection screen that actually looks bigger than that.  Can't wait to get back there for a game and some beers."}
{"text":"Walked in and were seated in 10 minutes. Waitress was kind but the service she provided was slow, beginning with drinks. Ordered after a while and waited 40 minutes for our food until I asked how much more time until the food was ready. Mind you, the place wasn't full like it has been in the past. She checked on how long more for the orders came which was 20 minutes more. Decided to walk up to pay for the drink and left after they said it was fine to not pay the drink. Yeah, not coming here again. Just went to the Wingstop up the way. Steer clear of this establishment. Too many waiters, probably not enough chefs/cooks."}
{"text":"These wing are not worth a 40mins wait for take out. Next time I'm going to the albertsons deli"}
{"text":"Ordered huckleberry lemonade and it came 5 minutes after our appetizers. Ordered 5 Parmesan Garlic and 5 Buffalo sauce. The Garlic Parmesan was okay. The buffalo came out dry rubbed... I asked the server if she can have it as a sauce and not dry rubbed after 10-15 minutes cause that's when she actually came back to check on us. She said we don't have buffalo we only have the dry rubbed. If I wanted the buffalo sauce I should order it as mild. We never got a refill on our drinks or water. We never got the buffalo I asked to replace cause it took too long. We were waiting 30 minutes for it. Asked another server for our check and it took another 10 minutes to get the receipt. Service needs major work."}
{"text":"Great for watching games. Bar food type, but better quality food. $3 talls during happy hour.. Did a fantasy football draft here once that was pretty cool too."}
{"text":"Can someone please explain why you would need to have 3...I repeat 3 TV's that are side by side playing the same Texas A&M game.  We just got up and left because they wouldn't change one of the TV's to the Oklahoma/OSU game...which is pretty much the game of the week. In the entire restaurant there was one dinky TV that was playing the game and we were pretty much sitting right underneath it. Just imagine sitting in the front row of a movie theater and you would understand why we left. Plus we had our kids so either my husband could watch the game or me but not both of us. Super frustrating.  You won't be getting our business tonight BWW.    I would also like to add about a month ago I ordered food to be picked up from there ... was told my order would ready at 5:30.  I didn't leave with the food until well after 6.  Not super impressed. That's 2 strikes now. XX"}
{"text":"Amazing wings to eat. They have so many different sauces for the wings. I also love there food and I love that when you get wings it comes with vegetables. Buffalo Wild Wings is always a great place to eat. Most of the time you don't have to wait to be seated and food come pretty quick. However the only downside to eating here is the noise. With a lot of people and bars and TVs all around, it can be hard to hear someone talking when they are sitting right next to you. Recommend for friends and family. But not so much for kids or birthday party's or big events. Definitely a good place to always eat at."}
{"text":"It started out a lot worse at the beginning than the end.  I showed up for a bar seat to watch UFC and the place was ridiculously packed.  I got my seat and got a beer right away, which was good, but then I watched how the bar was being run and I cringed.  It looked like three people were trying to keep up with the service bar while one guy was left alone to manage the rest of the bar.  I was lucky enough to be sitting closer to his friends, who he seemed to cater to more, so it didn't impact me as much, but a few people down the way looked pissy.  Trying to get another beer was a waiting game for the guy next to me who had his empty glass  as far forward as possible on the bar and a hand in the air.  Same thing when he tried to order food.  Food delivery was quick, once I was able to get an order in, and the quality was decently typical of BW3.  As the night calmed down, the service was definitely improved and more stable behind the bar.  The tables behind me seemed to be a little more taken care of by the mass of servers through the night, so maybe that would have been a better option, but I know that for next time.  Still worth going to in place of ordering the fights at home, and it's still a better place to hit up for wings and beer than Hooters."}
{"text":"When BWW was in the UNCC area I loved to go there. I only recently found out they moved to North lake. After convincing my wife to go, we arrived to find no hostess. One of the take out folks asked us if we wanted to eat in or to go, and upon learning we wanted to eat here did nothing.   Once we got seated 5 min later the waitress came to get our drink order and appetizer order. 15 min past and we got our appetizer which was the wrong one, and still no drinks. So my wife went to the bar to get them and was told they have been here for awhile I'm not sure were you waitress is. So another 10 min goes by and the waitress comes back and we let her know we had the wrong appetizer. I still don't know exactly what she was saying, but it was something along the lines of yeah I meant to tell you this is what your getting.   It was interesting reading the reviews here it seems my experience is the norm. This reflects just great of the management there. I thought this was a one off situation, I guess not."}
{"text":"Sitting at BBQ as we speak we just waited 45,mins for 6 mozzarella sticks and a jerk chicken. Sandwich. The food was warm but not hot. The servers were nice WHEN they checked on you if they checked on you at all. This was a really bad experience.. They brought Tue jerk chicken sandwich to my husband only to ask me oh did you get your mozzarella sticks then had to wait even longer for them not to be piping hot. Very displeased"}
{"text":"A captain? Really?  Dump the useless. captain and they you want have to charge 60 cents for an ounce of ranch dressing and 60 cents for 6 four inch pieces of celery.  Also ease up on the salt on the pulled pork and save a little more.  Food is average at best.  The coating just fell off the boneless wings. Service is annoying.  And the captain thing?  I do t get it. They nickel and dime you death. Now I remember why we quit eating there."}
{"text":"So I had reservations about coming to Buffalo Wild Wings because I had a bad experience at one a long time ago but I'm glad I'm able to say without a doubt this place is great. The host Amber was very kind and funny and ended seating me in the best place possible and I was able to watch the Spurs destroy my ticket lol. Crista was my server and she was absolutely wonderful she made sure the drinks was refilled and that my complicated order was made just right. Really kudos to her where most would have made a mistake she absolutely worked wonders. I also had another sever cailin stop by and make small talk she was funny and sweet as well. Looking around this atmosphere is wonderful there's literally a place for everyone. I gotta start having my game nights here or if I just wanna chill out with my son or kick back with my friends it's something that'll fit my need on the menu. I wanted to pull a manager aside and let them know what a great time I was having and what a great atmosphere they were creating and ended up talking to Peter. He was beyond engaging and I could see why this place ran so smoothly. I honestly feel like I made new connections and friends here and I can't wait to bring my family and friends. Thanks Buffalo Wild Wings for changing my mind and having a great restaurant. for many of you guys that know me know how I feel about industry and being able to connect this place will definitely be a go to and I promise you will leave with new friends and have a blast. And the house sampler is the best thing ever lol"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Buffalo Wild Wings. Great place to have a beer and kick your feet under and watch any game. Rob was great. He wasn't even my waiter but he checked on us multiple times! Great customer service. Hands down a great place."}
{"text":"I come here quite a bit, and though they are not the best wings ever, they are the most consistent as far as quality goes, and they offer an awesome selection in wing sauces! We usually go during the day for lunch and sit in the bar area... somehow we always end up with Bryan as our server! He's an A+ server, always remember us, even remembers the beers that we like to drink! Not bad for only going here like once or twice a month! I've never had a bad experience here, and we came here on a night when it was SLAMMED for a UFC fight... and still recieved great service!"}
{"text":"I'd say this BW3's deserves a solid 3 stars.    It's a chain.  Everything on the menu is fried.  The wait staff has flair (or at the moment, personalized football jerseys.)  But...in a pinch it's a decent place to go to watch a game.  Or eat some fried pickles.  I don't drink beer, but I am a fan of their mojitos.  And I can honestly say that the service has been nothing short of excellent the last half dozen times I've been there.  (yes, literally a half dozen...it's within walking distance of my house)"}
{"text":"Went out for a double date I had been planning all week with my girlfriend and her friends. Literally terrible service. We get sat, no introduction to who our server was, never got her name either. We order our wings and 15 minutes later we get the wrong order thrown down in front of us same as the other couple we are with. We send it back and a manager sprints by our booth blurting words at us that sounds like concern but she never actually stopped to finish her sentence. We get the right order eventually, and burn threw our meal. Fries all about a half inch in size, but we were too hungry to care. The other couple on the other hand proceeds to watch us finish our 20 wings as another 20 minutes go by... and then 30... and then 40... Our server skirts by also blurting words then busting a 180 before she even finishes her sentence because she realizes the other couple still hasn't received their food. My girlfriend decides to stand up and look for a manager, even spends some time standing by the hostess stand to no avail. Finally she stands by a POS system and a server glances at her asking why she needed a manager then disappearing. 10 minutes go by and another server walks up to our booth and again we hear \"Do you mind if I ask WHY you guys need a manager?\" We tell her the ordeal and she disappears. We decide to leave and get In N Out for our now starving guests, missing out on the bowling plans we had due to the amount of wasted time with no resolve. Never going back, really wish I could say who was at fault but nobody ever even told me their name."}
{"text":"I ordered for pickup online. My food was ready on time. They opened up each box and showed me the order to make sure it was right, which is pretty extreme, sending out a message \"we've screwed up a lot of orders before, help us make sure we don't screw up yours\". It was a little annoying because that's not my job. Not a big deal since I had 2 boxes, but the guy before me had about 10 and it took forever.   I got jalapeño poppers with bacon. I didn't taste bacon so much as liquid smoke flavoring, which was too strong (studies show it's cancerous). I would have enjoyed a plain one that just tasted of jalapeño and cheese a lot more.  I got wings with medium sauce. I had to guess when I ordered how much food was a medium order of wings, the menu didn't say. Google told me.  My wings had the regular medium heat sauce and they were good! The wings were tougher than I've ever had. I've never heard of a tough wing, but I kind of dug it. The sauce was good, but may not be for everyone. It had an extremely strong taste of celery and salt. Like someone added celery salt to the sauce and the cap fell off or something. They should have rebranded this as celery sauce. But again, it was really good! Some would find it too salty. I've never eaten here before and don't know if this was normal or not. This place gets 3 stars because I enjoyed my wings, even though I suspect they may not have been right.  Wings Over Madison is better, but is a delivery/takeout place, not a sports bar, and is not close to this neighborhood."}
{"text":"This Bdubs is a little hidden, it was really busy around dinner time but we did not have to wait which was great. I know normally Bdubs tend to have a lot of TVs going on; however this one seems to have its volume a little louder than I expected. The low roar of the crowd made the restaurant even more louder unfortunately. The food was decent and our waiter was very friendly and had our order to us in no time. The plus side is if you come with children they have iPads that will keep them entertained while you watch your team play!"}
{"text":"You want a wide array of wing sauces? You got it! You want great happy hour specials? You got! You want a friendly and attentive staff? Forget it! Just kidding the staff here is incredible, friendly and helpful! This is one of the best BWW I have been to.I recommend. If someone docent stop me, next time I am doing the atomic wing challenge! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}

{"text":"So much more than wings, not that there is anything wrong with just wings mind you. But let's talk about wings first, if that's ok. It is? Ok, thanks, here we go. Mild to quite hot, so they have something for every taste. They have sauce or rub, and if you order a large enough order you get to mix it up. They have seasonings for the fries as well. My goal is to try almost all the flavors. I say almost all because I am not a member of the 'Sriracha on everything bandwagon', I like it on Chinese food and that's it.  But enough about the wings, and my personal preference, on to the other food. The burgers are very good, the pulled pork is incredible and I couldn't get enough of the soft pretzels. So I say if you are in the area stop in for some solid bar food. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"When I heard that B double Dub was coming to the Norterra shopping center, I knew where I would be watching many football, basketball, etc and going forward.  We had been to the location at Scottsdale 101 and really liked it, but this one is just down the road= convenient!  I've been to this new location a few times now and sat in both the bar and dining areas and you really can't go wrong in either.  The staff has been great and put on any televised sporting event that i requested.  Had a great experience watching the US/Ghana World cup match in the bar as the staff was very friendly and into the match as were the patrons.    Now onto the food.  I LOVE the Mango Habanero wings.  They are smoking hot and delicious.  I have tried other flavors as well like the asian and a few others and they are all good.  They have a full bar and many beers on tap.    Now there is one item to note that is a bit of an oddity.  The men's room only has 1 urinal?  This is a bar folks and this has got to be one of the strangest things I have ever seen.  During TV breaks during the World Cup, there was a line for the men's room which is not a good thing after a few Stella's.    Overall, this is a great place to watch a game/games and I am looking forward to College and NFL games this fall."}
{"text":"Ok so it's a little off the beaten path, unless you live in that area, then it's right around the corner. If that is the case boy are you lucky. Ok so it's a chain, so what! These are still great wings any way you slice it, or sauce them! So if you find you self hungry and on that side of town, stop in for hot wings, and cold beer! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Was here from out of town with a group of about 25.. The team of waiters who served us were amazing.. we didn't even have to wait long for a table. Service was fast! Waiters were nice! Food was good! I definitely will be coming back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"The servers here are super friendly and always make ma laugh even when I'm having a bad day.  We go here for ufc fights. Sit outside and watch the fights it's always so nice. I love the mango habenero wings delicious."}
{"text":"I have been craving wings for about 2 months. When it comes with wings and me, it's not economical to go to just any wing place and order 10 wings, i'll leave hungry and upset. BWW, at this location, has all you can eat wings for $9.99, but only M-F 11am-2pm. Lucky for me, I was on my vacation and they were still doing the special.  My friend and I went and the place was dead. They had about 4 or 5 people total. We get seated in the far corner of the restaurant and it took our waitress 15 minutes to even show up to take our drink orders. Since we suspected that we were going to see this trend continue, we ordered our 1st order of wings. I got the spicy garlic and medium with these \"chips\" (which were actually round unseasoned potato wedges. They proved good for cleaning your palette for the next flavor of wings), my friend got the garlic parmesan and asian kicker with seasoned wedges. I enjoyed both of my flavors and LOVED the garlic parmesan. The asian kicker was way too sweet and spicy for me. Next we tried honey BBQ and mild wings, they were pretty good, but my favorite were the garlic parm.   During the whole time we were there, we saw our waitress maybe 3 times, other people served our orders, and refilled our drinks. She showed up after 20 minutes of waiting (I am really not kidding people, I timed it just to see how long it would actually take), she gives us our checks. I can't understand why it took her THAT long to even show up to begin with when it was DEAD! We were her ONLY table. Needless to say, she didn't get a very good tip from either of us. Sad to say, I would have given this a 4 or maybe a 5 star rating, but our waitress needs to be fired. The food was very good though, and if you get a hankering for wings, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Very satisfying!  2nd time here at buffalo wild wings and both time was excellent. The order: 50 piece wings and fried pickles 10 piece Asian zing - killed it 10 piece Thai curry - killed it 10 piece Parmesan garlic - kids loved it 20 piece salt n vinegar - always a favorite in our house hold!  Would have gave it 5 stars, but when I have to ask for drink refills instead of the waitress bringing it without asking - this is something I always frown upon. Especially when the place wasn't packed. Would go back for the food and hopefully next time I wouldn't have to ask for refills again. And yes I did tip the 16%, since she did ask every 5 minutes afterwards. Waitress name: Tiffany"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go to Buffalo wild wings all the time. We visited this Buffalo wild wings today to give it another shot. And it definitely fell short of our expectations, which were already low. Our server was less than knowledgeable and poorly trained, just like the last girl that served us at this particular location. We asked if the chips and salsa were refillable, to which she responded that they were definitely not. When our order arrived, delivered by someone else, we asked if the order only came with the few chips that were on the tray (there was maybe two handfuls). He said 'oh no man you can get a refill when you're done with these ones!' So the order was refillable, unlike what the server had said. The wings that we got had been previously fried and then reheated by being fried again. You couldn't bite through the fried chunk of breading and chicken unless you wanted to break a tooth. On top of all of this, our salsa had lettuce in it (what in the world?!) and our waitress didn't come back for twenty minutes at a time to refill waters or bring the check. It was a crappy experience, as usual. Buffalo Wild Wings has definitely gone downhill."}
{"text":"went for a drink ordered a old fashion  but was half full and nasty"}
{"text":"Every time i come here everything is great from food to service. Today I ordered for pick up and I believe the young mans name was nikko, he was courteous with humor on the phone as he placed my order and when I picked up he showed me all my items and accommodated my ranch obsession with a smile.  And my wings were delicious to boot. Love this bww location and the staff will always come back !"}
{"text":"The manager refused to put the sound on for the Stanley cup finals because there would be a UFC fight on that night. The fights hadn't even started yet and the sound was on for tv analysts discussing the fights. I'd understand him refusing to put the sound on for the hockey game if the fight was actually happening at that moment, but the fights hadn't even started yet and wouldn't for another four hours. He told me the prelim fights were on but he wasn't even on the correct channel! He further told me that if he put the sound on for hockey that would upset the UFC fans, and once UFC actually started he would have to switch the sound again, which in turn would upset the hockey fans. Mind you, I only saw one guy wearing an affliction shirt, so I think it's safe to say that the UFC fans hadn't really arrived yet.  I just found it very odd that the manager was more concerned about customers that weren't even there yet then customers that were in his restaurant spending money at that moment. Apparently, customers that will spend $5 to nurse their beer the whole night in order for them to watch a PPV fight are more important then my girlfriend and I who ordered beers, an appetizer, and 20 wings.   Also another note, we weren't the only table asking for the sound to be changed to the hockey game.   I'll be taking my business to Hooters."}
{"text":"I stopped going here years ago because the service was horrible. There was one time, I ordered buffalo wings from a disgruntled waitress then didn't see her for the rest of the night. I had to get up and get my own refill (those wings are spicy). But just recently I had friends in town and had a gift card to this place so I decided to give it another try. We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. We were greeted by a sleepy/hungover hostess who was rubbing her eyes and seemed very unenthusiastic. ..and I thought \"great, this place has not changed.\" We were sat and greeted by a much more awake and attentive server! She was very friendly and was my experience's saving grace. She was great, the food was great (we had the spinach artichoke chicken flat bread...so good, and shared some medium wings, great flavor) and we got refills without even asking! I think this place really needs to work on SERVICE and some other items on the menu...the wings are great though! I feel like I will always be apprehensive about coming here...but based on this past experience I would consider venturing there again."}
{"text":"Had the burger at a diifferent location and was super  impressed with the seasoning and the way  it was prepared.  Couldnt wait to have it, again .  Very dissapointed  with Tempe burger.  No seasonings added, no sauce.  Norhing that  made  it any better than a low quality, cafeteria burger.  I know BWW is a wing joint but any decent restaurant that touts signature ingredients in its menu and doesn't follow through  is not going to have repeat business.  Caution-may be  relying too much on their college  location to be quality. 2 stars only because server was great."}
{"text":"WooHoo for 60cent wings on Tuesdays! I've been finding myself at this B-dubs often for their bone-in wings. Wings are the same at different locations around town, but this place has awesome customer service. Not too crowded during the hours between lunch and dinner, and Waiters/Waitresses make sure your needs are met all the time. They make sure each visit is a positive experience- couldn't ask for more. Be adventurous and try the deep fried pickles - I love 'em!"}
{"text":"Yikes!!!  What a disaster!  My family was in search of a simple Saturday night dinner and were not looking to leave our home city of Surprise.  The last B.W.W. was a flop and didn't last long, but thought maybe this time around would be different.  Nope.    This place in a nutshell is over priced per frozen food served by a sloppy, fake, incompetent waitstaff.  A small order of boneless wings go for about $10.  As soon as we were seated a guy came to our table proclaiming we looking like we didn't knew what we wanted, and if we wanted to follow him to try their sauces and rubs.  No thank you.  He then asked us to fill out our contact info in order to be entered in to win free wings for a year.  No thank you.  After that, another guy came to our table asking if we wanted to try some chicken artichoke sample.  No thank you.  All this before we even looked past page 1 of the menu!  I could go on about the four various staff members who came to our table asking if we ordered various dishes, or the lady who brought our food to the table who just pointed at the plate (I assume she couldn't speak English), but you get the point.    The food was ok, but the staff can't get out of their own way.  When told, \"Please come see us again soon, my response was like the rest during that visit.  No thank you!"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and my husband loves the wings so I ordered a black bean burger and it was awful and hard as a rock. I couldn't break it with my hands let alone eat it. Super disappointing especially since it was a to go order and we live about 20 min away."}
{"text":"Not sure if this location has a new manager or what the situation is, but the servers are in need of a some additional training.  Last week, we were in and placed an order for our usual Asian Zing boneless.  The waitress brought the food out and it was a totally different flavor.  When she came back after a while, I asked her to verify what flavor I ordered to make sure it wasn't my mistake.  She said Asian Zing, so I told her she should take it up with the kitchen because she brought us Honey BBQ.  She then admitted she heard me correctly, but just entered it wrong.  Finally, noting we ate a couple, and rather than make it right or adjust the bill, she asked \"well, they're still good right?\"  No, we didn't eat some because they were good, we ate some because they only looked like what we thought we ordered.  Today, we were in again, sat in the middle of the bar area.  There were plenty of staff milling about the room, but no one acknowledged us for a good 10 mins until the bartender shouted across the way asking if we'd been helped yet.  I shook my head, then he had us yell our drink orders to him.  Apparently, this woke up our waitress and she showed up with silverware proclaiming our drinks were on their way.   Gee, thanks!    When it came time to leave, the waitress was very eager to bus our table and hurry us out of there for some reason, even though the place was fairly empty.  In her haste to clear the table, she spilled some leftover marinara all over my leg and the splash hit my kid's white hat.  (The best part was I had to listen to my 10 yr old complain about his favorite hat being ruined all the way home...awesome!)  Like last week, no attempt to make the situation right with extra napkins or any sort of compensation, just a giggle and a \"sorry about the marinara\".  Could be my bad visiting in in the dead of summer.  Perhaps their varsity servers only work football season.  I'll probably stay away until then."}
{"text":"Came in to pick up a Togo order and the staff was super friendly! They seemed to be busy for wing Tuesday but they had such a positive attitude. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We had a number of issues when we ordered online, so they put our names in the book to make up the order the next time (calling in rather than going online), but they forgot a few things again (we were in a rush and didn't have time to check our bags), so they put our names in the book again. The third time, the General Manager took care of our orders and bagging and went through each box of food to make sure everything was there- success!   Everyone was very nice and helpful, just make sure you order at the front or via phone (and check your bags if you have a large order). They did everything to make us happy and I appreciate that.   We'll be making BWW a weekly thing :)"}
{"text":"Why I am an elitist...  1.  I do not hoot and holler when my team scores a field goal in the final minutes of the 4th quarter when the score is 38-14.  2.  I try to keep a low profile when hot wing sauce has stained my shirt.  I'd probably clean it off first, but hey, maybe you're saving it for later.  3.  Ridiculing other patrons because their team is losing isn't cool.  4.  Your fuckin' Gator chomp is lame.  5.  This is a bar/restaurant, not Collegetown Bar packed to the brim with meatheads and Miller Lites.  I would have said something, but you were busy making love to your 3rd grilled chicken sandwich, fatty."}
{"text":"I've been to Buffalo Wild Wings before, but my first visit at this location was during UFC 117.  If you come here to watch fighting events like UFC I would recommend arriving 2 hours before the main card starts if you want a seat inside. I arrived an hour before the PPV portion of the fight started and didn't get a seat until half an hour in and it was outside. I ordered 12 regular wings and I was very underwhelmed. I felt the wings were overpriced because they are smaller than average.  The main reason why I went here was that they weren't charging a cover or bill minimum for the fight. Also, the atmosphere for a UFC fight was really good compared to the other BWW I went to in Tucson.  If you want a place with a good atmosphere for a sporting event, you should come to BWW. But your food expectations should be lowered a lot."}
{"text":"I am literally dumbfounded by my experience at this place today.  I'm already not really a fan because for having the word \"Wings\" in their name the wings here are mediocre at best and absolutely over priced. However, a few of my coworkers like to grab lunch here so I occasionally join them. The first few times we were waiting between 25-35 minutes to get our food barely leaving enough time to actually eat it before heading back to the office.  To offset this issue we got smart and started asking for the check as soon as the food arrived so everything could be paid for by the time we were finished eating. This solution was working for us but apparently they've been getting complaints because today they had a digital timer on the table. Our waitress explained that she would start the timer when we ordered and the food would be at our table within 15 minutes or it was free. Okay, I thought, they've got this issue figured out.  Wrong!  Once the timer hit the 15 minute mark in large letters on the screen it read \"Times Up\".  Still no food on our table so we all looked at each other and shrugged figuring we just got a free meal. When our food does arrive the waitress quickly scoops up the timer puts down our food and disappears. So, we eat and go about enjoying our lunch until eventually the waitress arrives with our bill.  Well, this is an awkward moment. We can either pay for food that should be free or basically accuse our waitress of being a liar. We chose the later and had a free lunch today.  The problem with all this is that if they would staff up appropriately people might actually get their lunch in a timely manner. I absolutely don't blame our waitress for this even though she tried to pull a fast one. It's really managements fault for not staffing up enough. Pretty sure the next time my coworkers suggest this place I'll either decline or suggest a different location.  #notimpressed"}
{"text":"Our evening started out great we walked in and got seated immediately which is pretty awesome for Buffalo Wild Wings. We ordered our favorite appetizers of fried pickles and cheese curds with a side of caramel (which is a must try).  Lexi, our favorite waitress, brought out our appetizers because she knew we where there just based off our order. It was so good to see her. The reason Lexi is our favorite is because she remembers us which makes it nice to quickly catch up with her while she delivers our food. Unfortunately we weren't at one her tables tonight.  We also ordered a BOGO medium boneless wings which is seriously the best deal ever! But the kitchen got confused on our order which is one medium to be Honey BBQ and the other Vampire Slayer with a little extra Garlic Parm drizzled on top. When they brought out our food it was horribly wrong and asked them to try again. They got it right the second time. Thankfully we weren't in a hurry.  Then we where charged for two BOGOs which our waitress fixed immediately once she saw the mistake and took on of the BOGOs off.  The reason for the 4 stars in a nut shell is simply this is normally a 5 star location and excellent service. But last night the kitchen and wait staff seemed to be off there game a bit (Except Lexi, we are positive she is always a 5 star worker)."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is always a good staple. Unfortunately, they didn't have the seasonal sauces, which are always fun to try.. however as we all know they have plenty of other choices that are so good. Personal favorites include Mango Habanero and Caribbean Jerk.  If you come here during lunch they have quick options available and they're even discounted a little bit."}
{"text":"Great spot for weekday lunch! Even though it was packed today (since it was Veteran's Day) the service was spot on and the prices great. 6 traditional wings, a soda a buffalo wedges with cheese came in around $10. Free wi-fi and I was set for lunch. Tried the mango habanero wings--perfect amount of tingling heat paired with blue cheese dressing make for a finger licking combo."}
{"text":"A good place to relax and have a beer and watch TV. The food is decent.  I'm disappointed they took the garden crasher off the menu.  Biggest issue is this location has been without their gaming license since the start of the year. They keep saying it's coming back soon but it hasn't"}
{"text":"3 stars because the people are nice.  Personally I like the salt and pepper, and would admit the buffalo is not true buffalo.  But I'm sure there are many other flavors that are good."}
{"text":"Walked in the door, stood there for 5+ minutes without even being acknowledged and had to walk out. Such a shame since I highly enjoy eating here and have been to other locations with no problems...today I was less than pleased."}
{"text":"I always love bww and have always had good service but at this place not so much there is a waitress in the bar section that is to busy flirting with her friends that come in than serving her tables. We had a really bad experience with her. We went back again during happy hour and they asked if we wanted to sit at the bar and we chose not to simply because of the waitress. She needs to go. Whenever I see her I will steer clear she's that horrible"}
{"text":"So, it's been a while since I've yelped....due to the busy hectic life I have, but it took this night to bring back my passion for Yelping.    It was a Wednesday night, not unlike any other night, but I was craving some wings....not just any wings. I wanted some good looking wings, just like the commercials, and wanted to have the opportunity to try some good tasty menu items that are featured on the website.  Off to wild wings in Steele Creek.....This is relatively new, appears clean and fresh from the outside and it features a nice large covered patio area with some tv's with ample seating.  But this mind you is where the good stuff ends, and the adventure begins.   It took a few minutes for the hostess to locate a table for us, there were 2 clean tables and six ( yes 6 ) dirty tables that were never bussed or cleaned in the main area toward the entrance or front door.  I mention six tables as they were the same six tables that were never cleaned prior to our departure.  The service was slow, the atmosphere or environment could have been nice, but regardless where you are .....if you are sitting next to trash and dirty tables, then you may as well be eating next to a landfill, this place was a dive.  Trash on the floor, filthy tables, and did I mention the dirty tables, Geez, the UFC was on, the football game was on, and all I could see was the trash!  So we ordered drinks and an Appetizer, the hostess was the food runner, and brought the mushrooms after 10 minutes or so.... The wings, well we were going to eat them there, however with all the trash, we chose to have our meals boxed to go since we could not stand the trash.  As I recall, there were no silverware for us to use , and the mushrooms came out in a cardboard type box, so why can't the servers just throw the trash away?   Will I be back, Don't Think so!  Just thought this location needs a boot in the buttocks, as if management noticed this and allowed this location to look like that, then it won't take long before it will become like the Buffalo, Nearing Extinction.  Very Frustrated....should spend less money on advertising and more money on training servers and management."}
{"text":"If you don't like being a super messy eater... I don't know if this is the best place haha.  But I sometimes don't enjoy it when the sauce ends up all over my fingers instead of on the chicken wings. To remedy this, I recommend a dry rub over a sauce. I love the salt & vinegar as well as the lemon pepper.. they taste fairly similar though. I am also a fan of the mango lemonade. I would love to try their hot dogs, but they only come in a set of 3.."}
{"text":"I'm the champ! Note to self, never do a spicy eating contest ever again....  In my younger invincible days, this would have been a walk in the park. Now that I'm old and my digestive juices are in second gear, this challenge was a marathon. Like all marathons, the pain and blisters set in the next day."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here during a Thursday night football game. We sat in the bar area and when the waitress asked for our order we asked if there were any specials/happy hour. She then told us that the appetizers were half off until a certain time. So we ordered two appetizers and then took a minute to decide what else we wanted. When I went to order another appetizer I pointed to what I wanted and said I'll have this since it's half off. She then said,\"oh no not all the appetizers are included in the special.\" When I asked which ones she named a few then said,\"I'll grab you a happy hour menu\" and of course the ones we ordered were not on there. Very frustrating. I will not return due to bad customer service."}
{"text":"Tuesdays and Thursdays nights! Tuesday special, regular wings for $0.75 and thursdays you can get $0.75 for boneless chicken wings. I prefer the boneless chicken wings, because you can gobble up the whole thing! I like all their flavours except the hotter ones....NOT because I cannot handle the heat but because like all wing places, the hotter you go the more acidic, more sour and tart and vinegary the taste the sauce becomes. I have tried their second hottest wing sauce and it was hot but I could handle it, I might try the hottest one the next time I go.   I like how you can choose a different flavour for every five wings. Estimation: the small size has 10 wings (option 2 flavours) , medium 15 wings (3 flavours) , and the large 20 wings (4 flavours). I like to get the medium and get one super, one sweet and one dry rub.  I am a sucker for their carrots and celery sticks as well, which is not included in the specials.   The ambiance is a typical sports bar kind of vibe."}
{"text":"Its been awhile since ive been to this location, happy to be back. Feven the bartender is exceptional!!! So is the large chested brunette"}
{"text":"Been here a few times started off good now it's down hill. Please can we get a 24 hour wingstop"}
{"text":"The wings are ok-- better than the miserable offerings at Quaker Steak and Lube.  My gripe is the service.  No matter how simple my order is I never get in and out in under twenty minutes.  I just don't get it-- you sell wings, so why does it seem like someone has to go kill a chicken and look up the recipe to get me some?"}
{"text":"Wings are good.  Not the best ever but pretty good.  I like that they have dry rub seasonings as a choice for the wings.  Service is good. Always crowded."}
{"text":"Good place to grab wings and beer. I went the opening day of Man of Steal. It was crowded but not to bad. It was fun being able to play the video poker game with more then just the poeple at my table. The servers were nice and fast. Over all I like it."}
{"text":"What can I say? You all know the concept. In this case there does seem to be a degradation in waitresses. I had the luck to be brought to my table by a lady who clearly wanted to be somewhere else. She deserved every penny of the top I specifically did not give her. Luckily my server made it up with sincere interest in my well being. She supported me with a great description of the many IPA beers on the menu (my favorite) . I chose the rebel IPA, great choose.  Boneless chicken wings were as expected. Wooden chairs do test the muscles of your lower body. Maybe next time get a booth.  So, are you staying at the Marriott closely? Just walk 200 yards and take your lunch or dinner at this Buffalo Wild Wings. No surprises, decent food for a good price .  Oh yeah, I take this bww over the Mexican place next door and the fake Italian restaurant down the street"}
{"text":"I moved to Phoenix four months ago. This BWW is the closest one I have! I've been here about four times and the service is always irritating. It seems like the servers always forget about their tables. They walk right by you and don't even stop to see how everything is tasting or if you need anything. I usually just get over it but tonight didn't go well. Unfortunately, this may be TMI for most of you but my girlfriend and I got really bad diarrhea once we got home. Never going back. Definitely don't recommend. I wouldn't even give them one star. Awful."}
{"text":"Dude! Who the hell charges $9 for a friggin caesar salad with nothing but a dab of croutons, and less less than a full chicken breast! My salad sure didn't look like the one on your website #fail  https://imgur.com/2St7MWm  Can I at least get some vaseline with your overpriced salad? A cigarette perhaps? Maybe even some cuddle time?  Now how about!?"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times in the last 2 months and have always had a good experience.  Food was always warm and good, waitresses are always quick and damn hot.  Not sure why this place is getting so many bad reviews.  Maybe I'm lucky?  You lost a star for one of my menus being drenched in some type of cocktail beverage.  Yuck, man.  Clean the menus, please."}
{"text":"This is the place to be if there is a major sporting event on TV. The televisions are big, plentiful- everywhere you look! There are daily specials and happy hour deals. If you're the only one in your group who doesn't care about the sport on the TV, you can play Buzztime trivia with a cool handheld device.   I was excited to try a new menu item, the Buffalo Mac and Cheese. It wasn't the creamy texture I was hoping for. It was dry and disappointing. I wouldn't order it again. I enjoyed the dry rubbed potato wedges and boneless wings though!  I visited on a Saturday night, around 8pm and it wasn't busy at all. Not sure if this good for business, but I liked that I could sit almost anywhere I wanted for the perfect angle of the Cavs game!  I learned on this recent visit that they have a reward program. I signed up with their app and scanned my receipt to earn points. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. For those who have been to Vegas before know that you can have an open container and drink on the strip.   I have been to this BWW before and brought my \"Fat Tuesday\" drink in many times in the past. I drive 5 hours from LA, get a yard drink, and get BWW. It's my thing and has never been a problem in the past.   Today while the restaurant was empty I was told I could bring the remaining sips of my Fat Tuesday drink into the restaurant. All four of us were told we couldn't eat there. The hostess said this was a new policy as of two weeks ago. I called the manager and was told it was two to three months ago that they made this policy. Fun fact... I was in Vegas and ate at BWW with an outside drink four weeks ago!! What poor customer service. I won't be back. Lost service to repeat customers. Not to mention the empty restaurant you would think they would be begging for business."}
{"text":"I was a server for 2 yrs at Texas Roadhouse. I know that servers get busy, I know sometimes you have hard days at work but I feel like today was unacceptable.  We were really nice and friendly to our server Matt when we got there. We waited for our drinks for a long time. We all knew exactly what we wanted so we ordered everything right off the bat from our drinks to our main course. Matt made a joke about how the last person he served said that he took too long to get his beer and he said \"I'm not a bartender I'm a server\" that should have been our first red flag. Matt took forever to bring our drinks... then about 15-20 minutes later he came back to the table and made a joke about \"oh I didn't forget to ring you food\" he obviously had cause we didn't get our food for another 20 minutes or more after that. When he got our appetizer he obviously knew we were upset but instead on apologizing he just slammed the appetizer on the table and had an attitude for the rest of the night. We didn't have drink refills we didn't have silverware. Our friend had to go to the bar to get silverware then when he saw that he brought silverware and yelled at him from across the room \"hey buddy!!!\" We're not your buddy were annoyed. We even spoke to the manager about how we just wanted boxes and our checks and he didn't even apologize or come to the table at all. Matt came to the table with boxes and he purposely bumped our friend he said \"excuse me\"  NO you don't do that to your guests. I've never tipped below 20% I have been a server I 100% understand,  but tonight I was really disappointed, we all were."}
{"text":"I ate here last weekend. The bacon burger I had was pretty dry. The wings were a little soggy somehow. It's a good thing I was pounding 23oz Stella's or this may get a 1 or a 2. Service was okay. Not much else to add unfortunately."}
{"text":"FATTY, \"ANTIBIOTIC-PUMPED-TO-KEEP-ME-ALIVE, STOOD-IN-MY-OWN-POOP-'TILL-THEY-SLAUGHTERED-ME\" _FEED LOT_ \"MEAT\". WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS COUNTRY'S MEAT???!!!  -- sure, on Wing Tuesdays they may be only $0.45 each, but the gristle, fat and squish they call \"chicken\" is barely swallowable. -- \"Beef\" ribs are little more than fat on a bone, slathered with sweet sauce. ICK. SEND IT BACK!! -- kitchen never on time. When your server stops by to say your food is on its way, that means at least 10 more minutes. -- limited beer selection -- bag salad mix sprinkled with bag shredded cheese and bag croutons. ugh.  sure they sell their 12 sauces in take-home bottles, but if they're cutting corners so heavily on the meat, just imagine what choices they're making in the sauces. BLECH!  Corporate quality gone amok."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch at 1:50. Lunch specials run from 11-2. Told the host I wanted to order the lunch special before 2. Restaurant was not busy at all. Servers were talking amongst each other instead  of serving customers. Noticed that it was 2 so I got up and left. Told the host no one even came by to take an order and his response? \"I'm sorry sir have a good day.\" Laughable. I'm a business owner and I would fire all my employees if they were as slow and lazy as the people working here today."}
{"text":"Decent overpriced food... But lately sauces are too hard to remember for takeout. Fried pickles without sauce. And Thai Curry wings with no ranch even though extra was ordered."}
{"text":"I prefer Wingstop. BWW didn't win me as a customer. Good sport restaurant to watch games though."}
{"text":"Great place! My husband & I went on Friday night, not too long of a wait and the place was pretty packed. I had the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich which was juicy, not greasy, and full of flavor. The fries were fries, but ok, nothing really special abt them. My hubby had the mango habanero wings and he said they were good, even for his picky palette. We had draft beer which was a little pricey, 6.25 for 16 oz. the service was great, we were never left unattended or felt we needed service, and our server helped us with our choices and had nice recommendations. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I just stopped in to pickup my FREE slice of Birthday Cake for being an E-Club member.  Very cool place with GIANT screen Tv and HOT chicks-my kinda place!  The cake was sooooo rich & sweet  my teeth are still hurting a day later!! And I didn't make it to bed til 1am!!   There may be a little bit of sugar used in the recipe.It's layered cake with choclate chips & syrup in between layers!! Yeah I know your jealous!!  Happy Birthday to me indeed! I'll have to come back for some football, wings & beer!! Looks like a fun spot"}
{"text":"Service is really horrible I mean terrible never will I ever go to this one again unless I'm ordering to go. I always tell my friends and family to drive the extra miles. I hate this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very cool set up with tvs, however service was pretty poor at the place better management is needed."}
{"text":"They are closed now. They forgot to tell their employees that they were closing so when people showed up for their shifts the following day, they showed up to a locked door. Now thats Classy"}
{"text":"Nope nope nope. Never again. I placed an order to go for wings and nachos. The wings were small and had barely any sauce. When I was at the register I checked the bag and noticed their wasn't any ranch/blue cheese that typically comes with at...virtually every establishment known to man. The attendant says \"Oh no that is extra\". Are you kidding me? Not only did I pay for wings the size of a child's thumb but I cannot even get a measly set of celery sticks and cup of ranch. When I returned home and opened up the box...the disappointment continued. Mind you I live 3 minutes away. The wing were cold and were extremely hard. I could not even finish them. I will go the distance and drive somewhere else. I will not be back at this establishment"}
{"text":"Walked in and there were three employees standing there.  NOT one greeted us and after standing there the employee went and greeted the party that came in after us......not the first time this has happened....get it together!  Customer service is what keeps the customers coming back."}
{"text":"Tried this place when it first opened in surprise not impress didn't come back ,then my boss told me to give it another chance it changed it been like 2 yrs give or take ,so we went back had good service went back again on a Sunday not busy took 30 min to meet the waitress to get drinks , waitress didn't even get told by the host staff we where hers. just very upset about this place they play it like it's the best thing on TV and it's suck at customer service now don't get me wrong once the waitress knew we where there she was on top of it she did a awesome job with what she could do between taking care of her customers and clean the tables she had cause they don't have bust boy/girls o well .that rant about the place ."}
{"text":"Good food and service. The bad reviews of service are not reflected by my experiences.  I have been there at least 10 times during the last few months and my experience has been the same-good, friendly service and chain food better than most chains."}
{"text":"This place is awesome because you can watch everything fights.   From UFC PPV to boxing. Anything sports.  The reason why I gave it 3 stars because the parking lot isn't big enough.  There are always full.  The service is good unless if it's really busy, it will take you awhile to order food & drinks."}
{"text":"I love you, Buffalo Wild Wings!  You never fail on me.  However, you should open one in San Diego.  I hate driving to Murrieta just for your wings."}
{"text":"Love it here!!! Mmmmm new menu items and new sauces! Servers are great! New \"captains\" are so helpful and informative. Love that every TV is on a different game. My requests were met fast and my food was hot."}
{"text":"This is your perfect spot if you wanna grab a beer and grub out on wings while watching a game. When you walk in you have their whole section with booths and tables you know, basic stuff. But in the back, you have the bar area. Tables and a whole wrap around bar with a bunch of tv's and projectors. I think it's great! My boyfriend and I went around 6ish so it was pretty busy and there were people waiting outside to be seated. But lucky for us, we're over 21 and got to just walk over and sit at the bar.  So, like I said they were busy and it took a few minutes for them to actually greet us and get our drinks. But lucky for them, i'm completely understanding and I don't mind waiting a few minutes if a place is busy. We ordered 2 tall Blue Moons with an orange slice. I LOVE Blue Moon on tap so if a place has it, I get it!  They had a special going on for their boneless wings. It was buy one get one. So we ended up ordering a pretzel for an appetizer, and a small order of wings(including the free one). The flavors we got were Honey BBQ, Asian Zing, and Lemon Pepper.  I was really happy that they brought our pretzel out first before the wings. The pretzel was huge (and delicious)! And our cheese sauce was soooo yummy! It had a little spice to it that I really enjoyed. By the time we were almost done with the pretzel they brought out our wings. The wings were great. The honey BBQ was nice and sweet, probably my second favorite. The Asian Zing had a nice kick that wasn't overwhelming, but I really enjoyed the flavor so these were my top favorite. The Lemon Pepper were my least favorite. I mean don't get me wrong, they were still great but I feel like it just doesn't work for boneless wings. Next time i'll try it on normal wings for sure.  All in all, I had a great time. We watched the hockey game and our servers Eddie and Angie (I think, I can't fully remember her name sadly!) were nice and made sure were were happy with our meal without being too in our face like some places can be. So like I said earlier this is your perfect spot if you wanna grab a beer and grub out on wings while watching a game!"}
{"text":"Is-what-it-is. Service is not horrible, just always missing something (a little extra friendliness; something). Wings are consistently good, this place stays busy, so you know what you're getting."}
{"text":"It's Buffalo Wild Wings!!! $0.45 wings on Tuesday!!! Oh Yah!!"}
{"text":"Dined in on a Friday night.  Was pretty busy downtown, but not busy in the restaurant.  We must have just missed the rush cuz the dining area was trashed. Waitress was doing her best to clean it up while waiting for our food to come out. Wings were dry barely any sauce. .street tacos were amazing... chili con queso was on point...was kinda pricey for a snack size wing and two apps."}
{"text":"Oh man, where to start? I love Bdubs, I really do, but this location needs to get its crap together! It's always hit or miss. I almost always order over the phone for pick up and I find myself often getting very frustrated as they mess up our orders quite often. Sometimes the wings are seriously under sauced, the food is cold, or we are left waiting in the lobby while they fix mistakes. When it's good it's REALLY good but they lack consistency! We've continued to go here for the last 2 years despite and will continue to go here. Please just work on being awesome 100% of the time instead of 50!"}
{"text":"I used to love BW3, before they went corporate. Don't get me wrong, the food is still good. Their menu has shrunk a little over time but their wing flavor selection is extensive. You can put the wing rub on the buffalo chips, fries and wedges now. They have a large selection of beer on tap and drink selection. They have plenty of TV's for sports and the trivia game. The reason for 3 stars is the prices are not way to high, I'm sorry for $8 for 8 mini corn dogs is not right. It's now over a $1 a wing for both boneless and traditional. They have plenty of space for a fantasy football draft. The corporate feel as kinda turn me off since the old BW3 here in Rocky River."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a Saturday afternoon for a quick beer and bite. We went straight for the lounge since we had no kids with us and it's always a treat to sit with the grown ups, in the grown up section.  The menu is extensive and exactly what I expected...a sports pub style menu. I appreciated all the sauce options you get to choose from...so many wings, so little time. In all honesty they are not any more expensive then any other place in town and we've had our fair share of wings....maybe him more than me. Far and few between are the good ole days where you used to be able to get 3 lbs of wings for 9.99. Or maybe it's just that I don't go out on Tuesday or Thursday nights anymore!  The service was good and I was pleased to notice they allowed kids in. In fact there were families in the restaurant area. Even have a decent kids menu from what I could see. Hubs went almost all the way on the spicy level of wing sauce. I didn't see any steam coming out of his ears, but you could see he was feeling the heat. He loved it.  It was good fun to drop in for a beer and bite. We will definitely be back when we are in the hood and looking to satisfy another wing craving."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch with wife, mom, and son. It wasn't a busy time of day, only 3-4 tables actually had people in them. Our waitress was very attentive and have awesome customer service. The rest of the wait staff couldn't get enough of my son, they kept coming by and complimenting him and playing games with him it was very nice. The wings were excellent and on point, as always, and everything else was great, just don't run out of Jack Daniels again! Had a rum & coke that was mixed well. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Gross. Fatty undercooked or overcooked wings with no meat. It's like they get the bottom of the barrel nasty leftover chicken wings. Celery sticks look dirty and old. Service is hit or miss. I come here to meet friends but desperately try to suggest other places. Only good thing is their sauces like Jammin Jalapeño or Asian Zing but hard to make a meal out of dipping my fingers into the sauce. Their concept is simple...distract patrons with 50 TV's while you ignore them or serve disgusting food."}
{"text":"Service was good. Quick and attentive Every game on for Sunday NFL! Huge plus Food was as expected. Not amazing but not bad either. I had the Mediterranean salad. It was missing some of the ingredients but was pretty decent.   I'd come back again"}
{"text":"First off let me say:: Nicholas was an outstanding server!! We usually go to the location on Hualapai and decided to try this new location on Durango... Way better service plus quality of food.. Everyone was very friendly and attentive.. Wings were not drenched in sauce & crispy how we requested.. Other location doesn't  bother to reply to request: just bring out whatever way..Lunch menu is perfect for two people to share.. Happy hour is great but noticed lunch is just the same! This location rocks & worth the drive! Bloody Mary & draft beer had an ok price for lunch ... 5 STARS"}
{"text":"We were there for cocktails and appetizers.  Gosh I really wan't impressed.  Can remember the waitress's name but she did not know what a Scotch was. They only had two choices for Scotch Chivas and Dewars.  Was not impressed with either one.  Their wings were OK, I preferred the original better.I got the hottest wing they serve and I cannot remember the name.  It didn't even tickle."}
{"text":"Worse bar service I've yet experienced.  Usually here with a friend because I'm not a fan of the place. My buddy wanted to grab a few drinks and protein as we passed by the area... big mistake Lol. As soon as we sat at the bar, I already had a bad vibe with the guy taking our order just by the way he stared at us. It was like he was reaching into our souls trying to tell us to leave. After conversing and finalizing our order while indulging our first round, we began to notice no one passing by to take our order. While waiting, we couldn't help but notice the 'Lighter Side' of the bar having full/persistent service. During the long wait, we also got to see our bartender converse with the servers more than the customers. Next thing you know, what was supposed to be a few drinks turned out to be just one, and with no pre-mature chicken wings in our bellies. CHECK PLEASE!  PS: The extra star was for the eye candy.. not including the ones wearing jerseys."}
{"text":"After a 10 hour work day, the last thing we wanted to do was cook. Felt like chicken wings so we picked up the phone and ordered a take order. Kim picked up and phone and took our order. She was polite, professional, and prompt. Twenty minutes later, I drove less than 3 miles to pick up the food. Upon arrival, the parking lot was full but I noticed BWW had spots specifically for take out. I walked right up to the take out counter and Kim was on the phone. She was incredible. We had casual conversation, she was friendly, all at the same time ringing up the order and at the end presented each item I ordered to me to ensure the order was correct. I have to say, I was utterly impressed with her. She seemed like she liked working there, was very pleasant to deal with, and her sequence of service was perfect! She thanked me for coming and welcomed me back. It was Kim's service level makes me want to do more take out order. Kuddos!"}
{"text":"I go to bww all the time this is by far the worst ever staff does not pay attention are running around like chickens with heads cut off and above that when we got frustrated and asked for a check my bill went from 10$ for one beer mind you I had told him since service was horrible I just wanted to get out and go somewhere else well the Einstein of a waiter we had named MOON   took my card came back was about to sign my receipt when I realized it wasn't my tab as a matter a fact his excuse is that he didn't pay attention and charged my card 50$ fuckin kidding me how do you not seeel that and he tried to assure me that everything would be alright two days later my account still showing it charged I got no apology or explanation from a manager just someone who walked by super fast and said have a good day really! Horrible customer service no care for the well being of the patrons like truly a nightmare and the worst part is every worker looked scared and confused should be ashamed for having ignorant employees they just wanted to tell us anything to get us out liars and thief's. You should be ashamed of yourselves."}
{"text":"Do you love sports and trivia?  Do you have a burning love for wings?  I have just the place for you...  Buffalo Wild Wings.  And that's just what they have - wild wings.  My favorite day here is Thursday.  Thursday = 50 cent boneless wing day.  I love boneless wings.  They are tasty and not as messy as traditional wings.  The ones here are great because they are nice and crispy (see FRIED) on the outside and hot and juicy (see MEATY) on the inside.  A perfect combo to match with one of their many sauces.  They even have a page in their menu with the sauce listings and descriptions.  They also list them in a heat-o-meter style so you know just what to order to suit your spicy taste.  You + a buddy + $15 +Thursday at BWW = 4 flavors, 24+wings, celery, ranch, bleu cheese, and enough wet naps to clean up even the messiest wingstravaganza.  If you are more of a traditional style wing fan, hit up 40 cent wing Tuesdays and chow down on all of the wings you want.  They also have a karaoke night and other gimmicky feature nights, but the wings are where it's at.  They have a lot of beers to choose from, but the selection is a little lacking for a gal who likes an amber ale.  Most people would (and should) be satisfied with the selection - especially for a chain establishment.  As for the sports, it's a good place to watch.  They have several (6 maybe?) gigantic projection screens so no matter where you sit you can see your game - as long as it's something reasonably popular.  Don't be tryin' to see your exhibition game when some national contest is being decided.  They also have about 30 other TVs showing other sports and the trivia game being played.  The place is family friendly, but I find that this is the type of place where parents just let their kids run amok (see ARCADE GAMES).  Leave 'em at home please - for me?"}
{"text":"Omg what happened to this place!?!? I will pass moving forward. The nachos were over $10 and broken with pump cheese. Yikes the prices are out of control and you don't get plates:-("}
{"text":"This is the First time I have been to this BWW. I absolutely loved it. We went on a Tuesday night. Our server was great, she really took care of us! I really recommend this location."}
{"text":"Met some friends at this location to watch the Cardinals game.  It was about the same as any other Buffalo Wild Wings. The wings are good, and the beer is cheap.   I really liked how big this Buffalo Wild Wings is. It has a very open set up and a lot space. When I got up to go the restroom I never felt like I was blocking anyone's view. There also were enough TV's around so I had a view of the game from where ever I sat."}
{"text":"Great layout and great variety of tv sceeens and channels for sports!. Hostess had an attitude as soon as we walked in. While ordering,  they did not have there new promo sauce that was out this month. Also, they DO NOT DO HALF OF WING TUESDAYS, instead they give a snack size wing for free for any size you purchase. Service was good, food was good."}
{"text":"I didn't realize there was a BWW downtown.... and a big one at that!  I think the BWW near my house could probably fit inside 1/3 of this location.  It seems like this location takes up a whole city block including their outdoor patio eating area.  It was a Monday night and the place didn't seem that busy - there were a bunch of large, seemed like after office groups but we got a table right away and ordered.  I tried the new Thai Curry sauce on boneless wings and was very satisfied.    Not sure why people were having service issues, maybe they were still training the wait-staff when they had bad experiences."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are regulars here. The service is pretty good can't really complain in this area. We had Laci tonight and she was fantastic. I find the bar workers are actually better servers than the floor servers. The food is good as well, I just stick with the boneless wings because the traditional usually aren't crispy (even when ordered extra crispy) and too big. Either way I always find myself wanting more."}
{"text":"SERVER FORGOT TO PUT OUR ORDER IN.  We were sat right away to a table by the window. We waited a little while for service, but she did acknowledge that she would be right with us. She got our drinks and apps, and those came right away. After ordering we waited for about 30 minutes. As it was very busy, we thought maybe the kitchen is catching up. 40 minutes later the sever apologizes and retakes our order because she did not put our order in. The food came out just as we wanted it, and it was very fresh. They did take the apps off, which was nice. I do understand that accidents happen, and we are all human things slip our mind. At the end of the day she was very nice, and a great server."}
{"text":"Can I give less than one star? Bad and impatient service. We ordered boneless buffalo wings basket and they are really really dry. We didn't even finish it."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if possible. Waitress barely spoke and sat at a table next to ours eating French fries with the rest of the staff and texting on her phone. The waitress was 10 feet from us our entire meal and did not refill drinks. Food took 20 minutes and we were 1 of 3 tables in the restaurant. We won't be back"}
{"text":"Buffalo WIld Wings is one of my simple pleasures.  The food is simple yet good.  I ordered 8 boneless wings as usual.  This time with the parmesan garilc suace.  It is my favorite sauce without heat.  I also ordered buffalo chips with cheese and cajun.  As usual they were quite tasty.  We had a large group and our server did a very good job keeping up with us.  The endless supply of televisions gave us several sports options."}
{"text":"I was worried because I was in North Las Vegas and thought I would have trouble finding a decent place to eat.  Luckily for me I found Buffalo Wild Wings.  I am thankful that they have expanded out west so much recently.  Like everytime I got 8 boneless wings and buffalo chips with cheese and cajun spice.  Lately I have been getting the desert heat dry rub.  It is a promotional optionn and a nice change from the normal.  As usual the food was good and the atomosphere it nice.  The free wifi allowed me the chance to get a little work done while I was there."}
{"text":"We happened to come on a night where the temp in the building was hotter than wings! No joke this is miserable here. People faning themselves with menus to stay cool. Wtf!!! I wanted a cool beer, nice rats, and a place to enjoy the game. This was straight busted. Step it up for realms this sucks. Won't be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Sitting here waiting for my appetizers. Ordered second from a group of friends and they got it wrong. It's been 15 mins waiting for it. Now our wings haven't came in yet. We're done with our appetizers except for me because they haven't made it yet. So I'm just waiting patiently. There not prepared for people like us coming from the club even though there open for 24 hours. Yes we're loud and Proud and gay at this time of night but don't give bad service. Slow service with one server and slow pace on getting the food done. Wtf is going on..... Oh wait now the food is here after how long? 1 hour!!!! Thanks idiots!!! Good luck trying to keep this place going! Every review counts and word of mouth always spreads fast!!!"}
{"text":"Oh how I wish there were options here past 10pm. We arrived, sat down, waited, waited, waited, witnessed waitresses fighting, waited, waited, were approached by a waitress, ordered, waited, waited, waited, waited. We watched tables just get up and leave, waited, waited. Watched tables ask for their check and wait, we waited, waited, waited. We are still waiting, but about to leave (it's been over an hour now). Our less than mediocre wings arrived, delivered by a server we hadn't seen before or would see again. 30 minutes later a server walked by, we caught their attention and asked for the check.  I didn't expect much and we didn't get much but they still managed to disappoint us! Well done."}
{"text":"Great staff.  Fast service.  Able to handle a crowd.  Largest B-Dubs I've seen.  I Like It."}
{"text":"Terrible service - super slow. Everyone with a \"Don't give AF attitude\" I would say more but then they would throw out the race card. Sloppy service, dirty tables and workers"}
{"text":"Tried Buffalo Wild Wings because Olive Garden was packed!  Big open space filled with tables and lots of TVs, noisy with all the sports going on. As older folks, not our type of place. Wings are their specialty but we chose salads for lunch. They were good but not a generous plate. Attentive service from young lady server who addressed me mostly instead of hubby. Not a smart move as he was paying the bill."}
{"text":"Well went here for the UFC  fight and they were at seating capacity. Basically we could stand at the entrance and watch the fight and order drinks. The cool thing was they had great drink prices and the server always came around to check"}
{"text":"I've never been to this B-Dub's until my fiance and I were craving food while at Fry's Electronics down the street. My fiance wanted chicken strips so I pulled up BWW on my Yelp app. I'm a fan of hot wings and BWW in general. I like the atmosphere and sitting in the bar area is always a best bet for quick and friendly service typically.  We sat in the bar and we were quickly greeted by our waitress, who was talkative and nice. She asked me about my tattoo and we discussed local tattoo parlors as well. So for service I am going to say 5 stars for our waitress, but I can't remember her name.  Next is food. Normally I order either boneless wings or normal wings. It's kind of a no-brainer. I mean, you are coming to BWW. But their potato wedges are really good too. On this visit I had a cheeseburger and let me tell you why. You see, there are a lot of fancy-schmancy burger places around town that will make you a burger with different types of sauces and rubs. They'll charge you an arm and a leg for them too. At BWW you can add any wing sauce or wing rub to your burger. Maybe the burger isn't top-notch quality, BUT you are getting a very interesting burger combo for a much cheaper price than at a burger joint that will upcharge you for EVERYTHING.  I got my burger cooked with the chipotle rub and it was delicious. I also asked for a small container of the chipotle rub to sprinkle on my french fries - so good too. You also get a selection of cheeses at BWW and I tend to go with the pepperjack cheese for an extra kick.   So, it does pay to take a look at the menu at a place even if they are well known for a certain type of food. I'm sure I'll be back for the wings eventually."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings holds a special place in my heart because it is the place where my husband and I had our first date. I know, it's just magical right? It was not at this particular location, but I still think back to our first meeting whenever I go to BWW.  This location is located in the Galleria Mall Shopping Complex and tends to be busy and frequented by quite a few patrons on the regular. It has the same feel as any other BWW you will go into. Sports bar, good selection of beers, great menu items, and of course tasty chicken. Whether you like it on the bone or boneless, BWW is here for you.  On my husband and I's recent trip here we had indulged in boneless wings, buffalo chips with cheese and bacon, and cheese curds. To be noted these cheese curds are made with cheddar cheese, which is hard to come by in Vegas because typically most places use a white mozzarella. My husband is from Iowa, where they serve cheese BALLS (and they are always cheddar), so this was a great find for him. My boneless wings were a bit on the dry side though and they didn't have the Sam Adam's seasonal beer they had featured in the menu that my husband wanted.   The waitress brought me a tall beer instead of a regular, but said the bartender just accidentally poured that one and she figured she just bring me that one anyway but still charge for the regular, which was fine. She did ask us if we wanted dessert while we were barely into eating our meal, which was a little odd, but oh well. Service was a tad slow, but the place was kind of busy.  Overall this BWW gets a solid 4 stars. I would obviously return."}
{"text":"I've been to this BWW so many times it may be weird that I'm giving it the two star rating. But the problem is I've been to other BWW's in the valley that are just SO much better than this one.  Here are the pro's: The place has a ton of TVs for your sports entertainment. Pair with a few beers, some wings and you got yourself a decent time with some friends. The wings are delicious, plenty of different spices to choose from. I personally prefer the boneless wings. The bar is decent as well, and I ALWAYS sit in the bar area. So that being said I can't comment on service in the restaurant portion of the place. Also to be noted - I've usually always had the same male bartender when I've been here and his service is actually great. He gets one of my stars all to himself.  Cons: It just isn't run as well as the other BWWs around town. Plus the place sometimes has a rank smell. I'm not sure what it is... but one time I went here and I literally walked out because there were soooo many people and it was just reeking of BO. Is it all the guys in there watching sports? I don't know... but maybe there should be a showering before entering policy or something. Oh and I've seen people in their cars getting baked out behind the place as well. Just not cool.  Lastly, it's a good place if you're a single lady and you want to find some cutie guys. Note - especially military as it is in the North Las Vegas area close to the AFB.  So there you have it. For some reason I'm sure I'll be back here... even though it's a pretty \"meh\" experience."}
{"text":"I've always been a sucker for Buffalo Wild Wings and I've never lived this close to one so I was ecstatic about this one in particular. I honestly like it better after-hours because this seems to be a very popular location during the day. There is one cashier in general (can't remember his name) who is always super friendly and very curtumer service oriented. This is definitely one of the better locations in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I usually love BW3 and this location was not great. We ordered two beverages, an order of boneless and an order of traditional. The wings were cold (both orders) and the boneless was so hard that I had a difficult time getting a fork into them. I did not eat them. There was no attempt to reconcile the situation. I've not had an experience like this at a BWW and having their name on this experience is shameful."}
{"text":"Upgrade the salad please. Just not good.  The chicken wings are great. The appetizer are good too"}
{"text":"We went in for dinner last night and I don't think I have ever had this GREAT of service at any BWW! Samantha was fantastic and checked on us multiple times throughout our visit, she never let our water get below half which is a huge thing in my book.   The food was also pretty spot on, the new Angry Orchard sauce is a little iffy.... It reminded me to much of apple pie LOL.  To bad I live in the NW or I would come to this location more often."}
{"text":"I love BWWs but the service here was HORRIBLE. I spoke to the manager about the poor service and he acted like he couldn't care less. I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Most horrible costumer service I've ever experienced! If you guys are trying to order for pick up this is the most horrible place. No customer service at all. Gonna put you on hold for 15 minutes and you get there and still wait for 15 minutes to be entertained!"}
{"text":"Did my girlfriend and I have targets on our heads?! Worst experience at bdubs we've had, we had the ultimate cheese sampler and the grilled cheese wasn't even melted, we asked to replace the garlic marinera sauce with sw ranch and they didn't do that either, they only serve 5 wings for traditional wings and 6 wings for boneless, versus the 7 they give at other locations, and before I forget they mixed our order and gave us traditional instead of boneless, and just to add, there were only 3-4 other tables occupied at the time  How could you make that many mistakes in a window of about 5-10 minutes  Oh and as I write this review one of the captains dropped ranch onto the next customers table LOL last time here"}
{"text":"Every time I order take-out (or dine in for that matter) my order is screwed up. I had it delivered and they forgot my ranch and celery. It's not a huge deal, it's just the fact that it's a frequent occurrence. On top of that I'm a broke college student with a lightly stocked fridge, so unless I'd like to dip my hot wings in mayonnaise, I'm out of luck. It's not that hard you guys"}
{"text":"We came here a few months ago.  The food we would give it a 4-5 star.  The wings were big and we ordered a Large with 4 different types of wings (sets of 5).  Our server explained everything to us so we understood how to order.  The night we came wasn't hugely busy, maybe about 1/2 full.  It just took a long time to get the food and particularly a long time to get the check.  For this I give it a 2-3 star.  They could speed it up a bit here.  Maybe they do this to allow people to watch sports on TV, which we don't do.  But, how would they know that?  We did go back to Buffalo Wild Wings, but to the Chandler Mall location, only because it was with the rest of our extended family."}
{"text":"I'm giving the same rating as I gave the Gilbert Road one but for different reasons.  We were a party of 8 sitting near the bar.  The restaurant was a bit warm, so maybe turn down the A/C.  The restaurant was maybe 3/4s full.    Service on the side of the long table where I was sitting with my husband and son was good.  Whenever we asked for more napkins, water, anything, it came quickly.  Our main server was Johnny and he gave really good service.  There were other people who also helped out that were good, too.  The wings were really big, like REALLY big.  I told my sister that I could eat 15, but after 12, which was a lot anyway, I didn't feel so good.  My side of the table ordered 50 wings (2 larges and a small) with at least 8-9 different set of 5 wings.  I prefer the medium spicy.  Those were good.  I think my husband preferred the sweeter stuff and our son liked the salt & vinegar.  Our daughter was eating from our stuff, but she was at the other end of the table.  When our part of the order came, they only gave us one little thing of carrots and celery.  It had 3 carrots and 2 celery and that was for 50 wings and 4 people.  I complained about that and it might have been a manager (a guy in a green shirt) said that's all it comes with because Tuesday is 1/2 priced wings.    However, at the other end of the table, they ordered fewer wings than us, maybe 1/2 of what we ordered, they got 3 little trays of carrots & celery.  So, what the guy in green said wasn't valid.  Johnny, our main server came back out with 3 more trays of carrots & celery without charging us more.  The guy in green said it would cost another $0.60 for each tray and though that isn't a lot of money, why did the other half of our table get triple the carrots & celery and only ordering half the wings we got?  For that, I knock it down to a 2 star.  Though service was great on our half of the table, my sister said for them, service was soooo slow.  They had to ask repeatedly for things and waiting a long time in between.  So, for that I give it a 3 star.  If you want less expensive wings, go on a Tuesday.  Service probably needs to be more consistent with all customers, but from what we saw for our end of the table, service was great, a 5 star.  The food was good, though, the fries were a little cold and we were told they were just made.  Maybe the person that brought the wrong fries and should have given us the newly fried fries."}
{"text":"If you love hot wings then you are definitely in the right place. I know I am because there's not one person in my house who doesn't. Today my daughter and I decided to go on an impromptu lunch date at 3 in the afternoon lol. We were seated right away, and because it was such an off time there were s ton of empty tables. Our waitress was great and even explained there Blazin Rewards Program I wasn't aware of that earns you points towards free food just for checking in. It can be done via app or in there restaurants. By the end of my meal I'd earned 350 points which already entitled me to white s few options like dessert and drinks. I ordered the street taco appetizer which comes with three mini tacos and medium hot wings. Both were delicious, but I'm a sissy and the medium wings were too hot for me ha ha so I ate a few and took the rest home to my son who loves anything too hot. I blame old age for my weakness . The tacos were just the right size and probably my favorite. My daughter got hot bbq and nearly ate them all. I'd definitely be back. Great place for sports lovers with so many TVs. There's not a bad seat in the entire place."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to the Las Vegas Blvd location but my waitress Mel was absolutely amazing. As soon as we were seated she immediately told us about the happy hour and the boneless wings deal. The food was delicious but Mel's amazing service made the experience a million times better."}
{"text":"The last time I went, wings had plenty of sauce on them. I usually order for pick up and the girl sounded friendly while taking my order. When I picked up my order, they opened all my boxes so I could see that my order was correct. So, if your order is wrong, it's on you. Little room for error (thumbs up). I just hope the sauce and service is consistent."}
{"text":"I love BWW!  We used to hit the one in Tulsa weekly.  We went to this location on 6/14/14 to watch the World Cup games.  We sat in the bar and the chairs were miserable.  They were made of wood and really hard.  The service was slow, although our server was nice.  The food was good, no complaints at our table.  In fact, we even ordered a dessert to share.  I ordered a mango lemonade.  It was terrible.  It tasted like a sweet juice.  I advised the server and sent it back and requested a water.  Once we were done eating, the server never came back to check if we needed refills, or wanted more to drink.  I felt like they wanted us out so the next person could come in.  Then when we got the bill, they charged me for that nasty mango lemonade.  I had the bill in my hand with my card so when the server came to pick it up I could request him to take it off.  Instead he was in a hurry and just grabbed it and ran.  I didn't get a change to say anything.  I normally give 20-25% tip, but we only gave him 15%.  I would recommend sitting in the dining area vs. the bar area."}
{"text":"Let's first start by how they bartend. They under pour beer so badly that the manager (Nelson) came over and demonstrated how to properly pour a beer. To go along with that, they \"measure\" their pours for liquor. However when they measure with the cup, it's under poured and not a a true 3 seconds. The food is below average but this isn't anything new. All of the chains that I've been at have been underwhelming at best. It's over priced, moody bartenders, mediocre food, and a dirty bar. We only came here because we knew they had tv's for the game"}
{"text":"I went with my family to this location and the host was very, very rude. First off, he didn't even greet me and my family. He didn't say hello, didn't smile, nothing. He walked up to his host stand, marked off something in his chart even before asking how many people were in my party. I then told him 9 and as he was walking away, he said that it will be 5-10 minutes. He made no eye contact with me whatsoever. He was just plain rude. My family and I then left and went to Raising Canes nearby. I've been a hostess before and having someone like this be the first person to greet customers coming into your restaurant is just horrible. No wonder why reviews were so low for this location. I will NEVER come back to this location."}
{"text":"Not my favorite wings. They were fatty and came out without very much sauce. Parts of the wings are literally naked, and when we asked for more sauce we were told we would be charged 70 cents.  After explaining more to our waiter he said he'd let them know, and they took care of the cost, but it shouldn't have been a big deal like it was when our wings came out with spots that were not covered in sauce. Then, we checked in and wanted to use the yelp coupon and it was a whole new issue of needing to take a screenshot of the coupon and then emailing it to the store. Im fine doing that, but it was just a weird situation. Our waiter was helpful, asked multiple times if we were doing okay, so that was helpful but the other stuff that happened really left me and my family not impressed with the restaurant or the food."}
{"text":"Great array of sauces for wing lovers, like myself...  The service was good but the food was better!  The type of wings ordered were Caribbean jerk, honey BBQ, spicy garlic, and Asian zing.  My favorites were Spicy Garlic and Caribbean jerk.  The mini corn-dogs are a hit with children, as my daughter ate the whole order by herself!  I ordered a Malibu Bay Breeze, which I had to explain to the server that it was a cocktail and the drink itself could use some more Malibu.    Overall, great place to have your beer, wings and big screens to watch sports!  :)"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, great food ,love to come here after work for a nice cold beer .Katie always bring me my favored beer and my double cheese burger , she's an amazing person with a great attitude I wish every where I go they provide the same service, that's why I keep coming back , I could go to 10 other sport bar to watch a game and have a cold beer but a good service you can't get it every where , if ever come to the Wild buffalo wings on Durango/Warm Spring You ask for Katie"}
{"text":"The service started out well but it took over an hour to get our food when the restaurant clearly was not busy and the waitress was not very helpful."}
{"text":"Not sure what they put in the wings here, but every so often I am overwhelmed with a craving to go in and scarf wings like there is no tomorrow.  Is it crack?  Is it something worse?  I don't know (I don't care) I love it! Only negative is the new way they are doling out wings.  You used to be able to order 12 or 18 or 50 etc, and now it's by weight and it just didn't seem as hearty as before. Excellent appetizers (fries with salt/vinegar powder and pretzels with cheese sauce). Great service from Veronica and as usual a really loud, fun environment."}
{"text":"Very horrible experience. Service was super slow, and the customer service wasn't the best. The system supposedly went down as soon as they put our order in but customers who came in and were sat right after us ended up getting their food before us. When we asked what was going on they ended up telling us our order wasn't even put in. Something to take into consideration when reading this as well is that it was not even busy.  I'm sure this doesn't happen too often but it was a very unpleasant experience and I will definitely not come back to this location."}
{"text":"This location is definitely the worst Buffalo Wild Wings I've ever been to, the customer service is beyond rude, I asked how long the wait would be and they said well when people leave. Then when ordering a kids meal they wanted to know ages and said they wouldn't give us the kids meal which was fine I was over it so I just said give me a snack size order, I guess then she went to her manager and they agreed to give me the kids meal but would charge me for the soda, whatever I'm hungry now and over this ordering issue. When the food came out it was wrong, of course it was why wouldn't it be any different? My husband decided just to eat what came out instead of arguing with them. I am just in disbelief that they were more worried about us ordering the kids meal than the girl throwing up all over the women's restroom making a mess, and Her boyfriend trying to get her out of the restroom. Thank God the food was great but I will never step foot into this Buffalo wild wings again."}
{"text":"Very rude staff. I ordered a water and then she asked what I wanted to eat and I said \"I think I'm good for right now\" and the waiter had the nerve to say \"oh, that's fine, you can just eat off everyone else, that's what having friends is for, right?\". I will never be coming back. Neither will our party of six that were disgusted. Learn some manners, Bri."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Waitress was gone most of the time. Then when I seen her she was eating. Really! How rude. Don't they get a break or lunch and go somewhere in private to eat. And how is she going to be eating while she is suppose to be serving. Husband asked for another cocktail by the time it arrived he was done with his meal! We will not be going back and we will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Wings are bomb. No need for reviews it's a pretty well known place that everyone enjoys going to. Customer service is always awesome."}
{"text":"I have been to many Buffalo Wild Wings in multiple states. I have also been to this BDUBS in particular. I am a fan of this buffalo wild wings. The service is spot on, the employees are great and it's a very clean place."}
{"text":"Don't know why some many bad reviews on this place. Overall I been here around 7 times, never a bad experience. The customer service is always good. I don't sit at bar so can't comment on that. I rarely have to wait. I wouldn't come here on the super bowl or big UFC fight it likely will be too packed.   I think sometimes they over sauce the wings. I pick a wing up and my hands are covered in it. Not a bad thing if you like that. Overall though good place, I will continue to come."}
{"text":"We took a cheap cab ride to Buffalo Wild Wings or B-Dubs as the locals call it.. It is kind of far from The Strip and not worth walking to unless you are that bored.  The great thing about B-Dubs are the sauces!  They have about 20 different flavors!  We ordered 24 Boneless Wings in Spicy Garlic and Medium Hot, Buffalo Chips, Fried Garlic Shrooms and some Fat Tires to drink.  It was waaaay too much food for two drunk people!  My favorite thing that we ordered were the Buffalo Chips!  They are not crispy but more like fries cut into little pieces of chip-like heaven.  Our bartender was really nice and made some great suggestions.  She was also from the Yay Area!  Our meal was really cheap too!  Another reason to hit up B-Dubs on your next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"i love buffalo wild wings!  they have a variety of different sauces to smother your chicken in from flavors like bbq, teriyaki, hot and carribean jerk!  there is something to please all palettes!  they also serve burgers, ribs and sandwiches here.  the full bar is also nice if you want to get a beer to go with your wings.  my favorite thing is the chicken tenders in the spicy garlic sauce.  yum!  i wish there was one in california that wasn't in the boondocks!  i would be here once a week.."}
{"text":"I was trying take out for the first time here. It was around 10pm and I just wanted medium boneless wings thai curry. The man on the phone, I didn't get his name. He was very rude to me and didn't seem like he wanted to take the time on my order. I ended up hanging up and not even ordering because of him. Tsk tsk!! Will NOT recommend!!"}
{"text":"Terrible location in the Chandler Mall with no parking because it is too close to the Harkins.  I ordered take-out and had to park a 10-minute walk away because the jacka$$ mall cops had the restaurant take out spots blocked off.  Finally get to the restaurant and it's screaming brat central.  Why the hell can't parents get an f'ng babysitter?  Forget sitting outdoors on the patio because there is one of those splash fountains that attract screaming little brats like flies to you know what.  Once inside the main TV has it's volume up to an ear-splitting level.  Forget conversing with anyone.  Got a headache in minutes.  The server at the take out brings my order out and, of course, it's the wrong f'ng order.  I ordered online.  It's really hard to f that up.  Wait another 10-15 minutes while the TV and some brat wailing like a human air raid siren assaults my eardrums and sanity.  Finally, the food comes.  Now the 10-minute hike back to the car past the open restaurant takeout parking spots the jacka$$ mall cops had blocked off.  I'm not going back to this location.  Oh, did I mention they were dumb enough to give me a survey?  $5 if I fill it out.  BWW - are you sure you want my opinion and you're going to pay me for it?  Spent the whole night tanking up on water as the wings had more salt in them than chicken.  Run from this location.  Oh parents, PLEASE get a babysitter and keep your screaming little human air raid sirens at home.  NO ONE but you think they are cute."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited the bar last night and received great at service. I asked to place a small order of boneless wings to try this months sauce. They let me try a sample before ordering and I am sure glad they did because this months special is nasty (lemon), taste like lemon meringue - gross! Service is great at the bar and the food is awesome as usual. Please bring back jamin jalapeño and Capt. Morgan sauce!!!"}
{"text":"I would like to go there with a bunch of friends. We can order a lot of chicken wings go with different sauce. The sauces tagged with spicy are no joke, they are reallllly spicy. but i still enjoy the mango habanero."}
{"text":"This is a great wings place. I tried the wings with asian zing, mango habanero, hot, thai curry flavors. The last two I didn't like. Wings with the mango habanero flavor were hot with just the right amount tangy essence. If you like something on the sweet side, then the asian zing is your thing. I am in love with their potato wedges. This is also a great place for sports fans; I love the vibe during game days. Given the number of customers they serve on wild Tuesdays or gamedays, I generally expect some delays getting my food. Last time when the food arrived late, the manager didn't even charge the prices of some food items they served. Qudos to such customer service. I definitely recommend this place specially if you are a sports fan."}
{"text":"A great place to grab some wings, beers & watch a ball game.   Plenty of parking, since it shares the Westgate Mall Parking facilities. A friendly easy going staff. You really can't mess up Wings, Fries & Drinks. I love B-Dubs !!!!  But for this location I only have these things to change:  A: The Music is way To Loud, good gosh I couldn't talk to my party at the same table.  B: place settings shouldn't arrive after the meal.   Other than that, I'll see you next year B-Dubs in Phoenix."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. I have seen such an unprofessional staff ever. Disorganized, the staff was talking about their weekends and gossiping, wrong orders were taken, some of the staff members were wearing tight fitted cloths that did not fit them ( I am not thin at all but I know my body and I feel that if bend over and I can see your crack it's not appropriate for work), we asked the manager for ketchup 3 times and we got was \"were looking for a bottle\", lots of vulgar behavior with customers (employees groping their friends who come in), and lastly one of the employees dropped a alcoholic drink on a customer and laughed. So unprofessional it's sad that they are still running."}
{"text":"Another place I had to try for lunch. No wait time was seated immediately. Waitress was definitely on top of things. It was a bit dark in there we read the menu by the light of the 52 big screen tv's they had. Or was it 54? Well anyway besides that my lunch was good. We started off with fried pickles. I have never had them before so we decided to get them my good friend Angela has had them before not from here but somewhere else and she makes them herself.  So it was time for me to try...I get it they could have been better but the breading was like a cornmeal coating I expected a batter dipped pickle. The dip was disgusting. An orange like concoction of wing sauce and mayo um yuck. Those were sent back. I ordered a honey bbq chicken salad for lunch and I must say that was pretty tasty. They did not drench the chicken in honey bbq. I was pleased with the size. I got full so I was happy. Angela ordered a buffalo chicken wrap I  it looked good too. Wraps come with a side of chips and salsa. Chips are good I like they are light thin and crispy. I would have eaten some of it but I hate to pig out someone else's lunch. Good thing I didn't cause I left full. Ok now yes I would come back again. Oh Monday's are double punch Monday's too. They give you a card and when those get punch full you will get 5 dollars off next meal. That's not bad because they do have specials."}
{"text":"Its what you expect, hot wings, beer, sports nothing to write home about but not bad either."}
{"text":"It's a great place to watch any games, but how empty it is on a Sunday during football season is a good indication that it's not so great.  Some decent beers on tap and by bottles.  Mixed drinks are available, but anything that requires carbonation pass on it.  We tried the club soda, the tonic and the Pepsi and they were all room temperature and flat.  What a way to ruin a drink.    The food...even for bar food it wasn't great.  How bad can you mess up a chicken quesadilla?  Not put much chicken or cheese in it for starters...It looks huge because of the tortilla used, but the chicken and cheese in all 4 slices would barely be enough to fill up one slice.    Again, great concept with all the tv's, but obviously coasting by on hotel traffic and unconcerned with repeat business."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Kimbo Slice fight; turns out we totally missed it, but didn't find that out until after dinner.  They wouldn't turn the sound on for the fight, even after the big football game people were watching ended.  We ordered drinks and beers, and the usual burgers and food.  It was all mediocre, in a plasticy, chain restaurant kind of way.  What kept the place from sucking was the really helpful, smiley service and pleasant atmosphere.  It's not the best food, best drink, or best place to watch a game, but if you find yourself needing to be there, it wont hurt you."}
{"text":"Seriously. So we ordered ultimate nachos with chicken and we got ultimate nachos with chili. We did go through door dash but Buffalo Wild Wings messed up. We also ordered 3 orders of wings and got only two orders. So not only did we get chili on our nachos and were missing a order of wings, our wings had little to no sauce and the manager we called was rude. He played the blame game. He blamed it on door dash and acted like the employees at door dash made the food. Although they should of checked the order, Buffalo Wild Wings messed up the entire order. We will never order from here again and will tell everyone how much they suck. Hooters here we come."}
{"text":"This place does not have good wings at all so don't believe the hype in those commercials you see on television when you're watching a sporting event.   All they do is pour sauce on already fried chicken nuggets and that's it. The wings are dry, and if it wasn't for the sauce, they would be yucky. Their sauce is great, though, so I'd advise anyone to purchase and use it for their outdoor BBQ dinners. You could probably do a better job with the sauce then their own cooks can with their wings. Additionally, their menu is too pricey for the type of food that they serve. Wraps, burgers, few dozen wings will run you easily $40.00 and that's not including tip. I'd rather go to a place that serves outstanding wings such as Hot Sauce Williams, east of town, and get some real chicken wings that are sauteed in sauces."}
{"text":"Im giving this 5 stars because of our server Laura she was the best.. Sweet sweet girl who was friendly. I will b going back because of her... Food and drinks were amazing"}
{"text":"UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  Not my type of place at all, but perfect for manly men and frat boys. Buffalo Wild Wings has decent food and an assorted menu besides wings, but it the atmosphere of this place that drives me crazy.  If you like loud overcrowded sports bars overflowing with testosterone you will love this place, but those are all things I try to avoid in a restaurant. Also the wait for your food can become ridiculous if it is busy which doesn't make and sense...cook some more wings pronto!"}
{"text":"I usually love going to this place but the service was extremely slow at this location and it wasnt that busy."}
{"text":"I came here last night with my husband around midnight. I love 24 hour places but I'm always wary about what kind of crowd I may find...drunk and mean....loud? I was happy to find a nice laid back crowd. When I walked in \"I thought... \"So is this where all the single men hang out?\". There were quite a few ..I'm married but just sayin...to any single ladies out there..that may value this type of info...male to female ratio was good! I also liked that the place was well lit and had good music playing it gave off an upbeat vibe. There are huge televisions on practically every wall playing sports but if you are like me and not into that they have these game machines at the bar. These aren't the poker machines which bore me to death ( they have those too) but they were just fun video games that were free. It was a good way to the pass the time while we waited on our food which came out pretty quick. My husband and I shared Nachos and the Blackened Chicken Salad. The Nachos were light and crispy they had jalapenos, cheese , chili, sour cream etc on them. It didn't give you that heavy feeling after eating it . It was really good even though I tend to stay away from chili. I liked that the chili wasn't piled all over the chips you can eat this without getting messy . The salad was also delicious ..the Blackened Chicken was nice and tender and had roasted garlic on it. it. The salad had tomatoes, red onion, croutons and creamy ranch dressing. The quality of the food was top notch for the price you are paying. I would like to come back in the near future and try their wings!"}
{"text":"Cheddar's was packed so my sister and I settled for this. We arrived around 6ish on a Saturday. It was pretty dead from the moment we walked in to the time we left. Not good, considering it was a Saturday evening.   Fried Mushrooms - So good! Juicy & fried to perfection! Garlic Parmesan Wings - The flavor was pretty good. Perfectly cooked. Tender & juicy. Only downfall is too much sauce. Spicy Asian B/L Wings - These were incredible! Perfection! Crisp, tender, just the right amount of sauce. Loved it! Nachos - Now this was a bit of a letdown. Salty. We took 2 bites. Couldn't force the rest. Didn't even want it to go.   Service wasn't bad but didn't stand out either. Maybe because it was so dead. Idk...but it was just okay. Nothing special about Buffalo Wild Wings. Just another typical wings chain."}
{"text":"I got a Caesar salad and a garden salad with chicken with a side of boneless wings for about $10.  It was very good :) it was the lunch special and it was so yummy. Would definitely get salads here again."}
{"text":"Came in today and ate with my family ! Food is great as always, you cant really go wrong with salt and vinegar rubbed fries ! I always get Parmesan garlic wings but today i also tried the thai curry which was actually pretty good . Our server Justin was really nice and checked up on us frequently , plus he was pretty cute so I mean I guess that is always a plus to have a cute waiter :)"}
{"text":"Great food, I liked it. It took almost 40 min to get my order, i though they forgot about us. However, it was worth waiting.. Would I go again? YES!"}
{"text":"I have gone to the Buffalo Wild Wings on Happy Valley in Norterra and never had any issues. This location is awful though. Horrible service, dirty and the food was awful. Staff was too busy talking to each other then helping customers though the staff was super friendly. So many better restaurants to eat at, at Westgate. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"the wings are fried with no flour dont taste that good after the place was sold  use to have .25 cent wing on tuesday NOT no more!... place went down hill  after the orginal owner  SOLD it !"}
{"text":"Ok so I've been here a few times and on each time I'm just a meh on my experience. I think meh translates to 3 stars in Yelp.lol.  Seriously Bdubbs is a solid place to watch a game, but I just don't think I will anytime soon. Plenty of TVs, but just too loud inside for me to hear the game. We ended up sitting on the patio which was boring, but at least we had a tv and our server turned the volume all the way up. That was nice.  But I felt like I was in a patio in any average bar. To be honest I found myself wishing I was home watching the game. It be louder and better view of the tv. After we got our bill I really wished I was in my living room!!! We ordered 2 beers, 1 burger and 20 wings and it was right about $50! Food was average at best, beer was cold but I just thought it was too much for what it was.   Not saying I won't be back here, but highly doubt I'll be here for a big game,or if I'm hungry. I'll come for beer and sports center next time.lol."}
{"text":"We went a few times .The first time was good .The last two times it was bad . The service is the worst ever. Its almost like theres no management . You wait for an hour for wings that's if they even give you a server. One time they forgot to give us a server and we sat waiting for a long time . We stopped going we don't have all day for wings .Im surprised they stay open."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service! After a night out at the speedway all we wanted was some cold drinks and hot wings. What we got was water and our order taken followed by an avoidance of eye contact from our server. Then we got to watch three parties get sat, have their order taken, served food and one pay their bill and leave. All the while our purple haired sever pretending we were invisible. After waiting patiently for an hour I asked to speak to the manager who offered no apology's and disappeared into the kitchen saying she would look into it. At that point we left hungry to our homes across town. I have never been one to dine and dash but I suppose you have to be served food in order to qualify for that. I have never been a big fan of BWW they have in the past given me some decent wings. Maybe the kitchen here is really good but I guess we'll never know."}
{"text":"So, I love buffalo wild wings.  I do.  It's definitely a staple in my weekly menu.  Healthy.  I know.  For some reason this bdubbs just seems slightly less personable and more commercial to me than the other ones.  Maybe because it's on the strip?  But, it usually takes a little longer to get my food and quite a bit longer just to place my order here.  Quality of the food however is about deliciously the same.  Yay wings."}
{"text":"The interior is like a sports bar, except they specialize in wings with a million different favors!!! We've got a really good deal as well: ended up paying  less than 50 cents per wing! Last but not least, did I mention all the waitresses there are super cute and/or hot blonde girls? I heart this this place!"}
{"text":"This is an audio visual extravaganza, one that will wow your senses. Over a gozillion flat-screens complimented by their piece de resistance; a fifty-foot* flat-screen at the head of the bar.  The other thing I quickly noticed is how bright the lighting is, making a good pair of beer goggles nearly impossible to obtain.   The wings are, well, wings.  What separates BWW from other wing joints is their many sauce features. My personal favorite is the mango habanero. It's spicy alright, but the flavor.  The flavor is if Venus herself wandered into a chile patch, gobbled down several scotch bonnets, then nursed you with her chile-infused milk. Holy shit are these things good. Hot, but good.  Another little feature is their blazing wing challenge. This is where some guy comes out of the back dressed as famous oil well extinguisher 'Boots' Hansen, and just after serving your wings, sets off a major explosion in your mouth hoping to 'cap-off' your fire. They do give you a t-shirt for your trouble (and tears) so it's all good.  Be forewarned! The next day is a motherfucker if you do take the challenge. I got pretty sick, but in fairness to BWW, I was never really sure if it was the blazing challenge, or, the fact that I spent the night passed-out in the Walmart parking lot huffing generator fumes from the Insane Clown Posse's tour bus.  I never liked those guys. Did they ever have a hit single? And why on earth do they have a cool tour bus?  *not really fifty, but it's major big"}
{"text":"Bww has good food for a chain.. Great place for a lunch beer and wings. There is a hidden gem in their traditional wings, get the traditional buffalo dry rub love them. The only way to go with wings!"}
{"text":"I almost never write negative reviews, but I feel like this is one of those times I should save you the heartache.  The service for pick-up was just fine, but the food I got back left a lot to be desired.  We just moved to the area, and thought BWW would be a good go-to that first week.  The boneless chicken (I got 12, my wife got 12) were popcorn-chicken size.  They were tasty, but seriously, seriously small.  Small enough that we busted out laughing when we saw them.  I like my baby chickens in egg form, please.  Worse were the buffalo chips with cheese.  We ended up discarding them after just starting to eat them because the entire bottom of them was adhered to a white plastic material.  I'm betting that it's a big chunk of whatever bag they come in when frozen that they got cooked with, as one homogenous lump.    I took a photo because I wanted my friends to see that we're now living in the future, where we're expected to eat space-age plastics.  I can't wait for the next step, my BWW Spicy Hot protein pill!  I normally love BWW, but I don't know why I'd come back to this one."}
{"text":"The servers here are so rude. I let them know we were in a hurry.  Selene replied. \"Well next time call it in\". She also seated the people behind us first.  Every time we come here it's the same story. The employees are just rude. She actually said \" I don't know if we have any wings down right now\". Isn't that what they serve!!!  We are here at lunch time. I would not recommend this place because of the customer service."}
{"text":"took my daughter here last year to watch some football and to get some wings.  service was great, wings were great.  i normally dont do desert but my daughter ended up ordering something with fried tortias sprinkled with cinamon and chocolate syrup and there were some hot fried cheescake balls that went perfect with the vanilla ice cream it came with.  probably the best desert i ever had.  sorry i dont know the name of the desert, just describe it to them, they'll know."}
{"text":"Okay, so I've been to the Gilbert location, and the recently closed Alma School location and never had an issue...  I officially had and issue!  So we walked in waiting for a table and... that's it. We waited for EVER! We stared at a few waiters and waitresses who looked at us, and the guy waiting behind us and nothing... We sat at the entrance looking at people expecting someone to check on us, and finally an older grey haired woman, CLEANING HIGH TOPS IN THE BAR AREA, looked at us... AND WENT BACK TO WHAT SHE WAS DOING!!!!!!!!!!  BAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  She was the only person for miles wearing a polo so something told me this was our gal.  However when she decided she was done, she trounced over and acted like we had been there for seconds when we had been there for almost 10 minutes waiting for life!!!  She annoyed me...  Word to the wise: PLEASE DO NOT DISAPPEAR FOREVER WHEN YOU HAVE A LINE OF PEOPLE WAITING FOR A TABLE TO SEE SOME SHITTY COYOTES GAME JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE PLAYOFFS!  YOU'RE A SPORTS BAR!!!!!!!  The food was okay, as usual.  However, now you have to pay extra for veggies???????????  For shit service, middle of the road wings, and a TV... I'll stay home.  Thanks Buffalo!"}
{"text":"We came into BWW and were told it would be a 45 minute wait for a party of 3.  So we decided to order take-out.  There were 7 open tables in the area of the restaurant where the take-out bar is, so we sat at one while we waited.  The hostess actually came and asked us to get up and stand at the bar.  If it was anywhere near packed, I would understand, but really, 7 open tables!!  They actually go out of their way to be rude here!  Too bad we already paid, or I would leave."}
{"text":"So working downtown you have to choose a place that's in walking distance and also fast. Which means you need food to come out fast and service that is also fast.  Had the best experience there yesterday! 5 of us went to lunch and ordered from the lunch menu. Everything came back cooked perfectly, no complaints and the waitress was awesome. Always checked on us and brought whatever we needed. I had chicken fingers with garlic parm wing sauce. My favorite flavor there actually. One of my co-workers got 2 different flavored wings, but didn't finish the last flavor. My other coworker wanted the last 2 so I grabbed them, moved them closer. Got wing sauce on my fingers. Eh, just wing sauce! Read the label and licked it off. 2 seconds later mouth was on fire. Mango habanero! I didn't read the little words on the label! Waitress saw me in pain and brought over water. Oh she even joined in the laugh. That's service with a smile, literally! Will def be going back there now, but I'll bring my glasses next time!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my sister last night. My sister and I asked for a table. 3 other groups of people came after us. Those people were seated before us. Not sure why. The place wasn't busy so there were plenty of seats available. So we sat at our table and ordered our food. When we got our food we had to ask for silverware because our server didn't bring us any. We got a sampler platter and wings. There was soooo much on that platter that we didn't really need anything else. The chili cheese fries were amazing! Fried pickles were probably the best I've ever had. The chicken strips were ok. There were a few that seemed to be really fatty. I guess that's hit or miss. The spinach dip was really good. Ran out of chips so we ate the fried pickles with them. My friends boneless wings were good. Again some were a bit fatty compared to the others. The place was clean, tables and floor were cleaned. Some of the booths seem to be fluffy people friendly. I'd probably go back there again, but try something different."}
{"text":"BWW is the definition of overrated, I ate there last night with the wife for the second time and many times I had to walk away from this place since it is always so busy.  I agree that it looks like a great place to watch a game, except the seats aren't exactly comfortable.  Not to mention the wings aren't even that good, I mean I wouldn't wait to eat there and I can think of many other places with better wings.  I even tried (4) different flavors just to see what I would like best, some were pretty good but it did not leave much impression.  The ranch is OK, we make ranch at home that is MUCH better.  I did have a honey BBQ bacon chicken sandwich yesterday and that wasn't too bad but my wife thought Chili's could have made a better salad....she had some sort of a chicken tender salad.  The atmosphere is nice and the service was average, can't say enough about how average this place is so I am not sure what the big deal is about this place but if I would rather go to Hooters to have lousy food with a better view."}
{"text":"Food and wings are generally good here, but it always takes so long for food to come out."}
{"text":"Better night tonight..food was excellent quality.  Alex, our waiter was also excellent, getting us what we wanted, we we wanted it.  Also..noticed that Tuesdays  & Thursdays are super busy nights for this BWW.  I was wrong, and I apologize.."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst BWW I have ever had the dissatisfaction to visit! I tried to place a phone order so I could just swing by and pick up some wings and snacks for the game and was put on hold for 45 minutes ! Then after visiting the store and explaining the situation to the manager I was told to wait in the to go order line wow what great customer service let's make our customers endure even more waiting after we screw up the first time! If you are on this side of town and want decent wings without the hassle of going to this garbage location go to the kopper keg the wings are on point and the snacks/appetizers are really good plus the service in lightyears better than BWWS. I seriously cannot caution any of you more than to stay far away from this place even on a slow day sitting at the bar you won't get decent service much less good service from managers down to wait staff thus buffalo wild wings is awful!"}
{"text":"What can you say its b dubs I love this concept sports decent food and friendly staff. I want to give it for stats but I'm not sure that's fair to the other restaurants here in Vegas that put a little more effort into their food and preparation. But that being said this location is great always get an awesome wait staff and smiles. So come on in the net is cold and the games are on."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting a Buffalo Wild Wings. Staff: Very friendly, helpful and nice. They deserve 5* Food: 2*.  They are famous for these wings??? Totally surprised that BWW has so many locations with the taste of their wings. We ordered 2 sauces. Mild and Sweet BBQ. Mild was ok, seemed bottled not made on location. Sweet bbq was also just ok, I would never come back for the taste. The bbq wings seemed like they piled them in a box and poured sauce on them. I like sauce coverage on EVERY wing.  My husband had the burger, he like it. I had the shrimp Po boy. Lots of shrimp, taste was ok...everything was Meh....  For the $$, we'll try someplace else next time."}
{"text":"I really liked the wings here, they're a lot different and so much better than the ones cover in popcorn flavor powder crap that you get at most pubs. Every basket comes with carrot sticks and celery with a side of ranch so I didn't have to order them on the side like how I always had to at other places. The only thing was how slow the service was, there were only 2 other tables and it took them half an hour to bring us 30 wings. But I'll definitely be back hopefully they'll change my mind."}
{"text":"Recently went for a late night dinner. Not crowded, service was still a little slow, but not terrible. The waitress was nice and polite. (Unusual nowadays)  I've been here before on weekends and it's always crowded. Lunch time has been acceptable, quick enough to get back to work if you have an hour.  The food was good and even as leftovers was still yummy! Prices are reasonable. My kids and I love playing the trivia games! Never a dull moment at B dubs!"}
{"text":"Just don't see the fascination! Other than having many TV's for sporting events it has no reason to frequent. Understaffed? Slow service! Food is marginal and over priced. There are other options I will be visiting."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that it was extremely cold in the restaurant, upon being sat at our table by Alex the hostess I pointed out to her that there were several tables (6 to be exact) that had not been bussed or cleaned. Her response to me was its not my job so I'm not dealing with it. I found that to be very in professional."}
{"text":"This location consistently provides bad service poor management and unlike other locations doesn't care about food allergies. No attention is paid to making sure something simple at no sauce in the wings is right. Server was hard to get to help and no manager to be found. We have given this location many chances but are done. Last time I put my son in danger and leave frustrated."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Buffalo Wild Wings but will never return to this location. Went for dinner on a Sunday n I was pretty patient considering they were slammed cuz football. Waited about 40mins for our food which came out wrong n I had ordered 8 boneless wings n received six. Service was terrible. Manager took 20% off our bill, but was rude n server appeared confused about it. I will drive 30 mins to a different location. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"*would do 1/2 star if I could* Worst food experience of my life. Waited almost an hour for a TO-GO order. Awful customer service and the only explanation was \"I'm not sure what the problem was\". After receiving our food, the food was incorrect and had to be taken back to the kitchen to be corrected. Spoke with manager, who didn't even offer any kind of service recovery (40 minutes after our food order was to be due) until we asked for our food for free or severely discounted. We were answered with \"oh I can only give you a discount\" (15-20% I believe). Flustered, we accepted the discount because we didn't want to let the food go to waste and at this point we were quite hungry. We get home and realize, we paid full price - the manager didn't even honor the discount he offered!!!! We were not an isolated incident, most of the fellow diners were upset and outraged as well. We've gone to Buffalo Wild Wings in the past with perfectly fine experiences but we will never be going to another BWW again. Wild Wing from here on out!"}
{"text":"We love B -dubs and usually dine at the hualapai location a few times a month. This time we figured we would try a new location just for some change and we are so sorry we did. Service was terrible. The waitress talked about the new caramel wings they had for this month and when my husband asked for a sample (like we are always offered at other location) she looked for every reason possible NOT to bring one. Seriously? I used to be a server so I understand how it gets but she had no interest in being at our table whatsoever.  Empty drinks, my husbands order was completely wrong. Food was good as always but we won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wild Wings but there service at this location is awful.  The employees don't care about there jobs clearly, the place is always filthy food all over the floor, they let tables sit dirty for a long period of time, last time I was there 3 tables set dirty for over an hour not being cleaned off.  I will never return to this location again especially after them forgetting my food twice in 1-day.  I really hope a hooters will open nearby and run this place out."}
{"text":"I normally really enjoy BWW. The food is always great at this location. I normally have good customer service and my food always comes out hot and fresh. I came in tonight around 8pm. My boyfriend and I had a couple beers which were cold and delicious. The bartenders were two friendly women who were very attentive. They weren't annoying or anything. The food came out very fast. We order a medium sized boneless wings and cheese curds. YUMMY! With all of this I had to give it 3 stars based off who we assumed to be the manager. She was wearing a grey polo and found out her name, Sarah. She was EXTREMELY annoying. We sat at the bar so we were expecting angry fans watching the Colts and Panthers game. This manager on the other hand was the lousiest person at the bar. Yelling at the tv and throwing the bar napkins. I don't know if she was drunk or what but it was VERY unprofessional. At the end of the football game when the panthers won, she threw the napkins up in the air. She walked over to the girl behind the bar and told her to clean it up and blamed it on the customer. SO RUDE. I don't know why she is the manager or whatever because she is ruining business. She ruined the entire experience. We even talked to the guy next to us at the bar and he was upset by her as well. This is a great location and it would be a shame to see it go down hill because they keep a bad manager around."}
{"text":"I've been here many times before and this had to be the worst experience ever...  It was Christmas Day and Bdubs happened to be the only place we could find open. We were about to be seated in 10 mins for a party of 7 which wasn't bad considering they were pretty busy.  At the time only 4 out of 7 ppl from our party had arrived so we decided to go ahead and place our orders.  This is when it began going down hill...  It took them 45 minutes to bring out wings for the 4 of us, during the entire time we never saw our server.  What bothered me the most was the fact that when our wings did came out they were pretty dry and they didn't even bring us the right or enough condiments. My cousin and I asked for blue cheese and all we got were 3 ranches for the 4 of us.  Luckily as our wings were delivered our server came back and we were able to place the order for the remaining 3 people in our party, which thankfully were delivered in 15mins with no problem at all.  Overall, I've been to this specific location many times before and they're always pretty good about their wings and pretty timely too. However, they did not deliver at all today especially on Christmas Day... which really disappointed.  To put into perspective how long we waited... we arrived during the 1st half of the Lakers Game and finally got our check during the end of the 4th quarter..."}
{"text":"Always super busy, and I am really annoyed with the people that come around and ask you what channels you would like to watch... And then don't bother changing them. It also irritates me that you have to pay a cover charge if they have a pay-per-view event going on since I am never interested in what they have on. The food is always satisfying, but  not great by any means.  UPDATE: 4-8-16  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE service. ALL of the staff ignored us when we walked in the door,(There was maybe 10 diners in the entire restaurant, and about 8 staff members right in front of us were watching a game and playing on their phones) so I finally had to flag someone down to be seated. Waited 20 mins before a waitress came over. Forgot our silverware FOUR times. Did not give us any refills on our drinks even though we asked TWICE. The table next to us had trash on it the ENTIRE time we ate. Food was decent I guess. Service was obviously not a priority today."}
{"text":"They get 2 stars instead of 1 because they have lots of TVs for watching games, but wow the service here is unbearably slow.  What motivated me to write this review is that I had three Guinesses over the course of the game and each time they came out looking like the photo -- a ridiculous amount of foam. The bartender was clearly never instructed on how to pour, dump the foam, wait and poor again. It's a rudimentary skill that all bartenders quickly grasp, but not here."}
{"text":"This place is waste of time and money. I suggest you go to the one on Las Vegas Blvd. Our server was o.k.. but lacks either experience or is not good on time management. He took so long to get to us. But that wasn't the main issue. This place falls short on holding customer service as their priority. Joshua, one of the servers of tonight, had such a bad attitude. Lets just say that his tables are all that matters and if his coworkers are behind, he'll let them sink. So for those who want to consider applying here, or eating here, please, reconsider. There are much better places than this place. Team work plays a big role when you're serving others. Without it you all fail."}
{"text":"This location is quite slow even it wasn't busy. Had a traditional wing with lemon pepper seasoning and a hot sauce, but instead, they gave me a Caribbean jerk and medium classic wing sauce. I wondered why the sauce wasn't hot and doesn't have the lemon pepper aroma. The wings were perfectly cooked though. It's just the service was a bit awful."}
{"text":"Came here on our way back from our business trip. We ordered the supreme nachos, honey barbecue wings, and a basket of fries. Everything was very good except for the nachos. They put hardly any cheese or chili so they were very dry. The only reason we ordered them was for the cheese and chili! The wings were very good as usual. The basket of fries was a basket of fries, they were fine. Overall a good experience, the waitress was kind and friendly as well."}
{"text":"I have the patience of Job but this place has no customer service or accountable servers with integrity(I say this because this is my third time patronizing this location with the same diasatisfying results in the end)!!! How does it take 45 minutes for a sampler and six wings to come out to a table on a Tuesday night an hour and a half before closing with zero crowd!!! Our waitress appeared to be the only one working (even though she had a slight attitude) while the manager was just standing by watching the high school employees gossip and watching our waitress work!!! I could have sympathized with the fact that she forgot to put in our order if she would have owned up to it!!!! The waitress wanted to blame the kitchen instead of taking accountability for her mess up which has made the whole establishment look terribly unorganized in my eyes. I know she forgot to put in the order because she came back to our table (30 minutes after she took our order) trying to blame the kitchen for the delay while strategicly trying to get us to repeat our order in conversation! I will never patronize this location again and I will be making sure that EVERY community and athletic group that I am involved in will not patronize this location!!!!! I am greatly disappointed that this location does not live up to the BW3 level of quality as other locations! I can't wait for my next businesses trip to Atlanta so I can stop by their BW3's and enjoy great wings, a beer, and quality customer service!! Go CAVS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"YUM! I was in Vegas for the weekend and one of the girls I was with was raving about this place. There were several locations in the Las Vegas area, but at the time - we were by this one. So, I was thinking.....of all the places to eat in Vegas - you want to have hot wings???? OMG, now I know why.   I've eaten a lot of buffalo hot wings in my lifetime, but I must say - the Spicy Garlic flavor at Buffalo Wild Wings were BANGIN'!!! The chicken was fried just right. The skin was crispy enough and the meat moist. The sauce was spicy but there was still a lot of flavor to savor. There were a variety of sauces to choose but I chose the Spicy Garlic for my first try.   The prices are good and the menu simple, great beer selection. When you're in the mood to just have a straight forward meal - this is the place to go, plus the big screen TV's are a bonus when there's a good game goin' on. I'm bummed, the closest location to San Diego is Murrieta!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you think it is...  It's a sports bar, but it's a large chain of BWWs, so everything is corporate.    You definitely don't get that feeling of a neighborhood sports bar like Duke's, Zipps or Pranksters where you can really feel at home and be appreciated for being a regular customer.   The food is pretty average.  The servers are all nice, but they are all pretty young, so there are some mistakes.  Just bring your patience and leave your expectations at home.   One thing I was REALLY surprised by:  So many parents brought their kids with them.  No sports bar (or sit down restaurant in general) is kid friendly.  Imagine people drinking beer and yelling profanities at all of the TVs.  That's exactly what happens.   I guess that's why it's so strange to see kids in a sports bar.  During my visit, there were so many kids, you couldn't walk to the restroom without tripping over one.   Just weird."}
{"text":"Horrible wings.  You either get over-scauced or under-sauced wings.  Extremely annoying for such an overpriced item.  I never have this problem at Wing Stop."}
{"text":"Five stars for sports and beer . 2 stars for service . We felt like we were bugging our waitress everything we ask for napkins or celery wasn't bought out or our food was wrong just wasn't a good vibe."}
{"text":"Pretty good sports bar.  TVs everywhere so this is the place to watch any games and sometimes a PPV fight.  I love the Chicken Tacos and the Garlic Parmesan wings.  The wings are in on the pricey side but they are good size wings.    I have tried their Cheese Curd Bacon Burger and the Bleu Burger and both were good.    I don't know if they have a Happy Hour but the beers and TVs make up for it on gameday."}
{"text":"It is what it is: a chain. I'd go here or a Panini's to watch a game. Or Winking Lizard. They are all pretty compareable in terms of beer and appetizer selection. Actually Winking Lizard may one-up them... All chains to me are a two or three star experience. They can have 3 since it was clean with friendly service and the TVs weren't too loud. Not worth it but it won't kill me if friends wanna go there."}
{"text":"Typical Buffalo Wild Wings.  Nothing bad to say about this place.  Expect loud people and sports, along with fried food and you will be ok."}
{"text":"Not my favorite BW3s. I love Buffalo Wild Wings but this place just lacked everything in food quality and presentation.   See my pics for this location. The only thing that was decent was the warm queso, that's it. I even left half of my black bean burger and potato wedges even though I was famished.  Just a place to come for happy hour drinks and queso & chips. The Rhodes Ranch location is better."}
{"text":"I brought a group of 8 from my Chicago Sports Meetup group for the NFL Draft Party and we had a great experience. I emailed the general manager Brad a couple days prior and requested for a couple tables to be reserved. You never know if it is going to be packed in the bar area or not so I wanted to be on the safe side.   A manager called and also emailed to confirm my request, and when I got there they moved a couple of tables together to accommodate us.   Our server Wes was very attentive and friendly. We got to enjoy their nice happy hour menu of $3 Jack Daniels/Captain Morgans/Absolute, plus $3 select appetizers. My favorite new appetizer is their soft pretzels with nacho cheese sauce.   Lots of big screen TVs and NTN trivia which are pluses. Overall a great experience. My only complaint is that they don't have the sound boxes if you want to watch another game with sound."}
{"text":"Street tacos tasted like they were made with hot dogs and not chicken. Service was lacking BIGTIME. Happy hour margaritas still were $7 each for well tequila, seriously? I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice service. Tasty food. They work to make things the way you like. And it's a good spot for late-night meals. It's also at a convenient location. Have been going for a while now and don't really have any complaints. It's a franchise but they do a good job as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"This is the first time we've  ever had a better than average experience at a BWW.  In fact I'm giving it 5 stars. The restaurant was busy but we were still sat right away in a booth. The food was excellent, hot, and fast. Our server Austin was very attentive and helpful and prompt. I'd definitely eat here again and will be asking for Austin in the future."}
{"text":"The staff at this place has no idea what they are doing. I don't think they were even trained properly. The hostess stand staff do not greet you when you walk in. They really don't know what's going on. The server I had on my second visit was absolutely rude. The third visit was even worse. The servers kept coming out with food asking every table if what they had in their hand was their order. When my order came out it was wrong but I thought maybe it belongs to another table since they kept going around asking whose food they had. I told the server I would eat it since it was wings it wasn't a big deal.   The issue with this place is that they are not staffed or trained for a sports bar. The staff seemed overwhelmed. When you manage a sports bar or work at one its always going to be busy, especially at this location. So get it together BWW. Train your staff properly."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS if it was an option. BWW northlake is horrible. Me and my friend was just now there. Sat there 20 minutes and no one came to took our order. Not even our drinks to begin with. Me and my friend just ended up walking out."}
{"text":"Went for wings at 10pm. Hadn't been there in over a year. Last time it was nothing special, hoped there were improvements.  NOPE, still disappointing.  Won't go back.  Too many other wing options in the neighborhood.  The place is large and nice with big tv's, but that doesn't compensate for the terrible slow service. I'm patient but not to that degree.  Ordered food, didn't see server again until he brought wings nearly 20 minutes later, asked him for a drink and again waited & waited & waited.  Then he came to clear table near ours, so I knew he wasn't busy. asked about my drink - oops! he'd forgotten and no apology whatsoever. Then we were abandoned yet again, so forget the free refills because the server won't attend to refill anything.  Even getting the bill was a task, just waited and waited.  Could see him leaning on bar looking at his electronic device/cell phone.  awful awful.   Filled out the survey online afterwards.  But my advice : don't go,. try another place.  Any other place"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, as it is just down the street from my house. I typically get a chicken wrap with honey BBQ sauce. They used to be really good, but the past three times I've eaten there the chicken was hard, like it had been sitting out too long, and had hardly any sauce on it. The fries were also cold and soggy, despite having to wait for them to complete my order (take out, and past the quoted pick up time)."}
{"text":"Why review such a ubiquitous chain?  Because.  The parking is terrible, the layout for this place epitomizes the bad layouts in this part of W.T. Harris.  The people are nice enough, the bartender said more than two words to me and wasn't to pushy with asking me what else I wanted.  It is BWW - they serve BWW food.  The food is no better and no worse than the other BWW I have been to.  I haven't been to a BWW yet that stands out in a good way, only the occasional sub-standard BWW.  Warning: BWW has horrible deserts.  I love free stuff, but when my free birthday dessert for this place comes around - I don't want it.  The brownie and ice-cream or cake etc. all taste like they were made last year in a factory and delivered frozen to BWW.  Don't eat the dessert, on that factor this place get a 1-star.  The wings are OK, don't get boneless - they are terrible.  I lived in Buffalo for 20 years, I don't know much about wings other than eating them and which wings I like better.  These wings would be considered OK by Buffalo standards, but I search for the better than OK wings.  I prefer these wings to Hooters, but not to actually good wings.  This is why I am reviewing such a ubiquitous chain.  Because."}
{"text":"It's not bad especially for a late night snack. Service can be slow at times but there's usually a good bartender that will make up for it. (Wish I could remember her name.)   Wish: Beers would be served with a 1inch head. I get that a lot of people prefer no \"foam\" and more beer but others may not. Just ask.   But, chicken wings are chicken wings and you can't go wrong with chicken wings."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Word of warning do not sit on the patio. Besides the billowing smoke from the smokers \"Not\" on the patio. Unfortunately management let's them go just outside the gate and smoke away. Even turn off the alarm on the gate so that could come and go as they pleased.  Literally the worst serve that we have ever had. And yes I get its a bar, but 45 mins to get our food, and then only have three out of the four plates. Ah where is the rest if the food. Another 5 mins the remainder of the food came.  Apparently if you sit on the patio they forget that your out there.  Food was average unfortunately.  When ask about the featured sauce the waitresses response was   \" aren't there enough choices for you!, We are out of the feature sauce \".  When I asked about a Golden style Sauce, She literally said \"We're not Zipps, We don't have that \".  Again, I had to laugh.    Maybe you should be more like Zipps, the place could use the help.  I will say the hostess staff was very nice.  Save your money and go to Zipps!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch Sunday football, hang with family and friends and enjoy some good fattening foods.  The nachos were good as well as the wings.  I have not had anything bad here and Rachel our server two weeks in a row is an extremely hard worker and they should be very proud of her.  I have not seen anyone hussle and work as hard as this girl does on Sundays.  If you get her as your server make sure you tip her well because this young lady always makes sure you drink is full."}
{"text":"Went to buffalo wild wings at Chandler fashion mall. The wings and shrimp were great. And street tacos were also good."}
{"text":"It's quite simply one of the best places to watch football, eat wing, drink beer, and spend time with friends. Tons of wing sauce varieties too! Many people go here just before they head to the football game so make sure you show up early. Onion rings are good to!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and have wings - no surprise! Right next to the ASU campus so many tailgaters nearby for the games...plan ahead to come here if you ever go on game day. Also, ask for their happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Came in last night at 10:45 to get some food. Got seated and sat there. Finally after about ten minutes someone came by so we could order our one round of drinks. I say one round because that's all we were given the chance to order. Half of the food we ordered was wrong when we got that. And instead of offering to fix it our server started explaining how she can't get us something else because she \"already entered it into the computer and would have to charge us for the correct order\". Yes really! So we say whatever and eat what she brings. At the end of the meal my girlfriend asks for coffee and was told \" I don't feel like cleaning the machine to make a new pot\". Yep. So we wait for our check. And wait. Flag someone down so we can ask about paying and finally get our server to come out of the back. She comes out, makes a comment about \"didn't eat very much\" to my friend who didn't even get what she ordered and proceeds to grab one of her wings and eat it. Yep, eat it. They says \"these are good you should have had more\". Blown away. Amazed. Disgusted. This was horrible. Writing this is greater detail for the Vegas newspaper. Just, wow."}
{"text":"Awful as always terrible service low quality food I should have just thrown the gift card away"}
{"text":"The place is super good. They were amazing with their service even though I am a vegan and only got celery and carrots. Ozzie is an amazing host. I hope you are there when he is working."}
{"text":"First off, I'm just visiting a friend and was just curious about how this facility was run and secondly, I came here for the half off wings. The server was very nice and informative about the special on Tuesday. Overall, the customer service was great, the food came out hot and fresh from the kitchen, the facility was clean, the ambiance was better than most Buffalo Wild Wings I've been too. I would come again to this location."}
{"text":"Good wings and I got a killer burger there.  Liked Hurricane Wings better, but this place is a bit more casual feeling and does have a good selection of dry rubs/sauces. The habanero sauce was good, but a bit too heavy on the habanero flavor.  High ceilings, clean tables, good service.  If you like sports its a good place because thats all they had on their tvs. No news on though. Had some sort electronic trivia game too where you can compete against other customers.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Buffalo Wild Wings in the past, mainly in Tampa where I live.  Most of my experiences at this chain have been average.  I went to this location after a work function while I was in Cleveland as the locals wanted to gather here for some reason.  Thinking it was the middle of the week with not much going on, I figured it would be a run of the mill outing.    They had good drink specials I suppose, but the service was lacking.  It took almost 10 minutes after my arrival to even be approached by a team of servers that was tending to our table of 10-15.  Once I placed my order it took another 10-15 minutes to receive my Diet Coke and Water.  Not sure what the hold up may have been.  I suppose they may have been waiting for enough snow to melt to fill up my water glass.    Anyhow, once our orders were placed there was mass confusion.  None of the orders came out together.  People got wrong items or items were missing all together.  I guess having 3-4 people waiting on a table of 10-15 is just not enough???    The one thing that made the experience enjoyable at least was that they had on screen trivia going so it helped pass the time.  I guess this may have been a way restaurant management thought to entertain customers who have to wait for slow service."}
{"text":"We have been to this location many times, with minimal issues. Today was a different experience. We went around 1130 for lunch. The restaurant was basically empty, and the lights were turned all t he way down. It was so dark that it was very hard to read the menu. We ordered mozzarella sticks to start, and then wings for \"Wings Tuesday\", which went from $0.45 cents a wing, now up to $0.70 a wing. Taking that, plus the extra cost of ranch, carrots and celery, is really no longer a deal. The wings and other food were delivered, and we had not received our mozzarella sticks. I told the server, and also told her to not worry about them, since our food was already out. She begged and convinced me to get them anyway, since they would \"only take a minute\". She claimed it was \"totally her fault\" that they did not come out. We ate the food, and I had an empty soda glass on the edge of the table. Our server hardly came by, and completely ignored the empty glass on the table. Another server even came over to the table, grabbed the empty cup and never returned with it, assuming I was finished with it, even though I was still eating my food. I get the bill, half expecting the mozzarella sticks to be comped since she had to beg me to keep them, but no... They were still on the ticket. Usually B-Dubs is good at handling the situation. Not today. We were completely ignored. I watched a manager stop by every table around us and ask us how their meals were. She completely skipped over our table. Severely disappointed! The only reason they get two stars is because the food was good and plentiful. I would give a \"-1\" star for customer service if I could!"}
{"text":"The service is horrible. Drinks are never re-filled. Waiters are hanging out nowhere near their tables. It's overstaffed too. There are always waiters hanging out with no tables."}
{"text":"I would rate them better than a 2 star but not quite a 3 star. More like a 2.5 For starters, I do appreciate the atmosphere and great staff. It's a family friendly environment and food is your typical bar joint entrees. I ordered the black and bleu burger. It was VERY OK. I'd expected it to have more flavor but instead, it was rather dry. Without the cheese, it would have been a bland burger. It came with fries that were 5 minutes away from being cold. Not a huge fan of BWW but for what they offer... I guess they are OK. This one is tough to rate."}
{"text":"I normally try not to post negative reviews, but honestly 1 hour and 52 minutes to get our order of tradition wings on a Tuesday during a \"game\" this must be a joke.  Our waitress, not responsive, an hour after waiting we asked where our food was and she says \"it's the World Series so the kitchen is backed up.\" Oh thanks for the heads up when we ordered or ya know checking at all at any point during the hour after we asked. Of course once our order arrived it's wrong too. My boyfriend ordered a snack size and a small was delivered while my friend ordered a large blue cheese when ranch came out. What a mess.   I will never return to this location. Terrible service with sub per food, no thanks. Not to mention we paid full price for everything on the bill. Buffalo Wild Wings please do yourself a favor and close this location."}
{"text":"This might be the worse BWW in Las Vegas. My co-workers and I recently came in here for lunch for their \"fast break\" lunch and let me tell you it was NOT fast at all. We all ordered the wings special so I really can't imagine why it would take sooo long. It even took 15 minuets for a requested blue cheese to show up. Crazy.  If you're a huge fan of wasting time I certainly recommend this location, otherwise make the trip down the street to Wing Stop and you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"This place has a laid back atmosphere and friendly staff. Our server Jackie made our meal so much fun with her awesome attitude!!!!!!!! We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Went here one night with a couple of girl friends who all live in the gilbert area (including me at the time) when we were in the Tempe area and had the case of late night munching. We came in a got seated right away. The service was pretty average, our waiter made sure we had our drinks full at all times.   I can't say I was pleased with the drinks or food they served. I ordered an ice tea of some sort and I could practically crunch the sugar in my teeth! The wings were almost cold when they brought them out and tasted like they hardly had any meat left on them!   Pretty disappointed at this location from all the times we have gone to BWW we have never been so grossed out by the food. Next time we want wings we definitely won't come to this one."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to eat dinner, took over 20 minutes to get someone to come ask for our drinks. And over 30 minutes before a manager came out. Very dissatisfied! After we got to order the manager actually paid for the whole bill. I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Horrible place go to the west valley location !!! Table are sticky !!! Waitress don't give you everything you need!!  Don't even get a carrot dip!!! No napkins on site . Had to make them remake my bbq wings there where gross. I do not recommend no one to come here !!! Had the manager give me my refund ."}
{"text":"40 minutes for food. Worst service ever waitress never checked on us. Seemed like other tables were also getting bad service. Also I'll add they were not busy and this was lunch on a weekday so normally restaurants are well staffed. Taryn needs some training in service."}
{"text":"Very poor service, food standards are below average compared to other Buffalo Wild Wings in the area."}
{"text":"Sat and waited and no one came. We had to find someone to get help. We waited about 45 minutes for our drink order. Another 20-30 minutes for our food (which we ordered at the same time as our drinks). Our waiter was not friendly, kept rubbing his nose and eyes, and kept looking away. He was not happy to be there, and it showed. Another one of his tables openly told him how bad his service was as they left, so I know it's not just me complaining. We spoke with the manager, who was nice and understanding, but still we will not be coming back. I've never had worse service at any restaurant.  The food was decent, and other servers seemed to be okay. Experience was terrible."}
{"text":"I have been to this place multiple times. I love the food ( when done right) and the atmosphere is awesome. However, my issue is that they don't put nearly enough sauce on the wings. Most times I get wings that end up being bare on one side. With such great sauces, and wings being the selling point  of this restaurant, I would imagine that they would be a little more generous with the sauce.  You have to ask for extra sauce to get a normal amount.  Service tends to be on the slower side also. I don't mind waiting a while usually, but just so others know."}
{"text":"I usually love going to BWW but last nights experience was HORRIBLE! Our server-Aaron, was terrible. He takes our order then he's never to be seen again, just walks by without acknowledgment to any of his tables, not once did he stop to make sure everything was good, even after our order came out. My husband ordered a burger that came out dry & overcooked with no toppings just meat & bun and I ordered a wrap that they failed to put the sauce in & was the size of kids order. The manager is a useless jerk that follows the female servers & host around like a dog in heat, any attempt to speak to him about the problems & he just blows it off like its nothing. In the end we had to flag down our server just to get the bill. They really need to refocus on their customer service & making sure food orders are correct (the menu really isn't that difficult!)"}
{"text":"For a new restaurant this place is pretty good. The service was a little slow and it wasn't very busy but I'm sure it will improve. They seemed to have a lot of staff just standing around. That being said, when the food arrived it was pretty good. I had wings, of course, and they arrived hot and flavorful. Our table also ordered a \"make your own burger.\" It wasn't flavored, just cooked, real well, and came juicy and as ordered. Drinks were filled when needed.  Atmosphere was pretty cool with lots of tv's and pub fare."}
{"text":"Loud sports bar type with typical chicken nuggets and wings. Service rises just par, nothing special. Basically, it'll make a turd."}
{"text":"went in today for some wings with the fam, ordered the spicy garlic and mango habanero. Both were yummy . Service was super friendly!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to our server for failing to let us know there was no more traditional wing deal on Tuesdays... we went on a Tuesday last month and end up spending double what we supposed to ($100) and all our server said to us afterwards was oh I thought y'all knew.. never again"}
{"text":"Ive been to varrious BWW's across the valley and this is probably one of the more popular ones because of the Harkins and the festivals that take place (shameless plug).  Look, I love the dusted wings and that's literally it.  So those wings alone will get 5 stars.  I could eat dozens of them.  Why the three stars?  Well we went there weekend during the Phoenix Film Festival and probably sat for a good 10min before someone came to help us.   \"Oh have you guys been helped?\" after waving them down.   \"Uh no.. not yet\"  Waitress comes over \"Oh I didnt see you guys over here.. hehe\" (we chose to sit outside)  Ok we're ready to order.  We had about 45min to eat/drink before our movie started, so we had to do it quickly.  I dont mean to sound like a butt, but this happened twice this weekend, but instead of not showing up for 10min, near the end of our second visit, they dropped the bill off and left for a while.  We literally went to find them.  I believe we told them upfront that we had a movie coming up.    I know.. \"Why did you go again if you had horrible service?\"   Because that's the only place right next to the theater to eat at when you have 20min to eat.  (Im aware of the Vietnamese place, Cafe Pino, and Yoshi Bento).  Will I go again? Sure I will.  If the wings sucked, then I probably would find another place.    Funny after reading this review back to myself, you'd think Id give it one star.."}
{"text":"Ive never been a huge fan of this place.  Buffalo Wild Wings is good for one thing.. their wings.  However I was pretty disappointed in the wings this time.  Im a dry rub person when they are available.  Tasted like their wings were cooked way too long.  So they were not great.  Best Buffalo Wild Wings was the one of Scottsdale 101... but they closed and are another sports bar."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their wings.  Unfortunaterly that's where it ends with this place.  I have no problem going here, but I usually expect less than ok service here.  The last few times I've been here, the hostess was always pleasant and sat us promptly. The server will come over all friendly asking us for our drink order, a few minutes later we'll order the food.. and that's where we seem to lose our server.  This has happened a few times now.  It's like once they drop the food off, we are no longer their customers.    I love eating at a place where they are always checking on you to make sure all is good, the drinks are filled, so much that you are left saying \"wow, they really want to make sure all is good!\"  Not so much here.  Food was good, though they did try to screw me out of 6 extra wings on my order.  I had to count the wings and got a \"Oh.. that's weird.. I'll go check\""}
{"text":"BWW holds a special place in my heart reminding me of days in college when I would grab some beer and wings with friends for an affordable, if nutritionally lacking, meal. I was excited to move so close to one but unfortunately both visits the experience was average due to super slow service.  The last visit in particular the service was painfully slow. I came in with a group of 6 when it wasn't crowded. It took over half an hour after ordering it for my drink to come out. We got bone in wings instead of the boneless that were ordered. It also took forever to get the checks.  The food was still on point when it came out and I love their new (or at least new to me) buffalo mac and cheese. I would suggest coming here when you are not hungry because by the time your food comes out you will be. I am sure I will return to watch some games and .65 boneless wing Thursdays but I am in no rush to go back."}
{"text":"Came in alone and was seated in Gavin's section. He was a not a very good server. It started when I told him I wanted a Mountain Dew with no ice and that I wanted the Buffalo ranch wrap to eat. He then repeats the order back to me and goes to the back to put the order in. Comes out with my drink with ice. I shrugged it off and didn't make a deal about it. He also informs that my food will be right out then disappears till after my food comes out. So my food comes out and he isn't even the one that brings out. So I assume they have food runners that just run food to tables, but at the same time this place is pretty empty so I'm thinking \"Why?\" So I'm eating my food not even half way done and he's bring me my ticket and telling me to let him know if I want to add anything to it then he's not seen again till well after I was done. Never checked on me to make sure the food was good or that I needed a refill (which I did) so I give it three stars for great food poor service."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Three open tables and we were told to wait, two seats open up at the bar sat there for 10 minutes without even being acknowledged. Got up and went to Twin Peaks..much better!"}
{"text":"Ordered wings online a couple of hours prior to the Super Bowl to ensure there was enough time to complete the order and to get any notifications if anything went wrong with the delivery.   They were set to arrive between 7-7:30 PM during the Super Bowl (which I was fine with). At 7:30 I received a call (thinking it was my delivery) only to be told they would not be delivering any food tonight.   They literally waited until the last minute to inform me that my Super Bowl party would not be receiving any food that night.   While talking to the manager he was highly unprofessional and kept blaming other people instead of owning up to the situation.   Avoid this place at all costs, there are many other wing places in Uptown Charlotte within walking distance that are better."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm reviewing a chain, but my husband and I are trivia nerds, and this location is really close to our house, so we do end up here from time to time. The wings are decent, and the draft beer selection is pretty great (Strongbow cider on tap, yay). We always get excellent service- Lisa and Sarah take especially good care of us, even remembering what we like to drink. It's a nice touch."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have become regulars every Tuesday for the traditional wing night.  We started coming here when we moved to the area a few months ago, and found that they stay open until 2am every night.  We both work late, and it's awesome to have something to look forward to every week.  I had never been to BWW before, but I have become a major fan ever since.  Their wings are crispy and well-sauced.  I found that the honey mustard is my favorite, with the honey BBQ a close second.  Hubby likes to try different ones on occasion, but always seems to go back to the honey BBQ.    We've tried a bunch of their apps, and really enjoy the pretzels or onion rings.  Lately, I've been starting with a side caesar salad.  The lettuce is always cold and crisp, with a nice helping of parmesan cheese and croutons.    We don't always have dessert, but when we have, the cheesecake bites are really good.  We've also found that the staff is incredibly friendly, and love how they greet us with recognizing smiles.  We've actually had waitstaff come to our table just to say hi, even if we're not sitting in their section that night.  We usually make our appearance pretty late...after midnight...so it's usually not busy in the dining room (we don't sit in the bar), and we'll get our choice of table.  We like to pick one where we can both watch the TV's comfortably."}
{"text":"It's wings! I'd say the serving was typical. We ordered the Thai curry wings. Someone should tell them that the amount of curry powder used is not typically Thai. I'd say it tasted more like British/Indian curry to me. It had a nice amount of heat though and went well with the beer. Potato wedges are always a good call. Theirs was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This made for a good midnight snack."}
{"text":"I used to like this location.  It's usually busy and has a good vibe but lately they've been playing country music which makes me want to get up and leave.  The wings have been taking a while to get out to us too.  The servers are always pleasant so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Okay, I will not comment on the excellent food and sports option here because I will assume everyone knows that about ALL the BW3's.   What makes THIS BW3 SPECIAL IS EVERYTHING ELSE!!!  Open 24/7 and hilarious about it. So, I needed some time away from taking care of my crazy ass grandmother (not senile, because she willingly says creepy things to people for a reaction). At 2am, I walked up, doors locked, a spot light on a lone switch, pressed it...3 seconds...LOUD SCREAM!!!...i jump like a douche, bartender runs out the other door, apologizes, gives me a shot of Jameson's as consolation.  Upon ordering, he turns on a surveillance tv pointed towards that same spot I pressed the enter button...PURE ENTERTAINMENT for a solid hour.  This place gets my seal of AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"I was out of town and needed to watch the Real Madrid vs. Barcelona game. I yelped and came upon Buffalo Wild Wings. I arrived around 3:00 p.m. There weren't much people around but a lot of people working. It took a while for someone to seat me. It also took a while for someone to take my order. It was disappointing to see that there were so many people working but no one helping me.  The wings were good but the fries were cold for my liking. I've experienced much better Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I AM a fan of BWW, however today was a huge disappointment! The restaurant hours posted online and at the location state they open at 11am. I sat outside with 2 small children, after not only pulling on the doors multiple times but also calling to confirm opening time. I could see multiple staff members moving about the restaurant, including 2 ladies at the hostess/greeting entry way. At 11:18am I walked away from the restaurant with 2 hot & hungry children, disappointment, & now lost respect for this location and the management/staff. It's unfortunate that you lost business (3 families walked away) due to lack of unprofessionalism & care for your customers."}
{"text":"I've only been here maybe 2-3 times. It's the typical wing joint that's open until 1 - 2 am, has tons of flat screen TVs, and people screaming at the sports that are playing.  I wouldn't come here if you want to have a nice dinner and have a lengthy discussion with someone. It's too loud with all the screaming and yelling.  I really like their wings though, and their food hasn't been disappointing."}
{"text":"We decided to grab some wings today. Considering it's a holiday and football Sunday, the wait wasn't that bad. We did sit at our table for almost 10 minutes before our drink order was taken, but the waiter was very apologetic and super nice. The place was beyond packed so we knew there would be a wait. The food was great!  I tried the sweet tea and it wasn't bad. I'm from the south so it's hard to find sweet tea up to my standards anyway. I had the chickens fingers and they were really good. My husband got Caribbean jerk boneless wings and ate all thousand of them. Well not a thousand, but it was a LOT of wings. This location is near our house. The atmosphere is fun ( a little loud for our 6 year old). Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Nothing like wings and beer on a weeknight and catching the games. Pretty cool environment, and overall I would go here again. Definitely a very good place to chill with the boys after work.   Stay classy BWW!   From ya boy,  The Yelp Sheriff!"}
{"text":"Came here with 4 of my friends and let me tell you, The server by the name of \"ED\" who works the night shift really was a rude jerk. This guy was sarcastic and very unfriendly. My friend asked him for a drink for another friend and he answered her in a rudely manner saying \"If she not here I'm not serving you\". We will not be coming here again"}
{"text":"not happy with my experience at all. I came to here for a quick dinner and my friend and I walked in, only to be greeted/seated 30 seconds later. The hostess' were standing right at the booth and didn't say a word to us and the one of the girls just walked away. Anyways, we get seated and I ordered boneless wings and the server asked if I wanted celery or carrots and I said celery (cause it comes with those right?) and I also asked for extra ranch because they normally only bring 1. So we wait for about 30 minutes for our food and when it finally comes, we  eat and everything's great and then we get the check and our celery and every side of ranch(4 total) was .60 cents each?! our server was totally great don't get me wrong, but that's a really cheap execution on BWW's pricing. Finally when we leave, some girls dismiss us but not even a glance was shared between the both of us! She kept her eyes down the whole time and seemed like she couldn't care less. 2nd time here and won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"My favorite Buffalo Wild Wings! Came into today again and had a great experience! Our server, Misty, was so sweet and accommodating. Definitely made my friend bday lunch more fun! The food is always on point and delicious. Fun atmosphere and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Second time at this location. Not my favorite, but the service was good. Our waiter was very eager to please. We ordered the appetizer sampler, queso and chips, drinks, and large orders of boneless wings in their honey bbq and garlic Parmesan. The food was just okay but the service made up for it."}
{"text":"I came in and ordered a To-Go order. The girl working did not let me know about the 70 cent Thursday wing special and charged me the regular price. I asked a different girl who was my cashier was the special on Tuesday or Thursday, and she said oh it's today. I said \"really the other girl didn't tell me.\" So she asked if I wanted a manager for a refund, I said yes It was a refund for like $3 and change but it's not the price it's the principal. When the manager Aj, came over he hardly looked up at me he just went straight to the computer. I understand that they are busy but a greeting would be nice I finally smiled and said Thanks after he refunded me. Then when my food was ready I checked and it was just the appetizer, I was still waiting on my wings for like 10 minutes so I asked them to check on them. They also asked my name 3 different times. Get it together Bww."}
{"text":"Consistently awesome. Love the spicy Gallic and Asian zing. Service can be a bit inconsistent but everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"Walked over to Buffalo Wild Wings due to the craziness of trying to get to Mill on the 4th and was super disappointed!! We sat down and there was only a couple other tables and quickly ordered a beer; however we never got it! Our server never came back to give us our beers even though they were sitting there for about 8 minutes to get picked up. After watching him walk over to them multiple times and him not bring us our drinks, we had to leave. Super disappointed!"}
{"text":"The new pour policy of 1.5 inch head is horrible. And will cause me to discontinue patronizing this local bar and grill. The glass is 23 oz and now with the new policy it is less than 20 but the prices have increased?????"}
{"text":"This BDubs is hit or miss - most of the time it is a miss. The food at all Buffalo Wild Wings is standard bar fare - but what sets them apart is the cost - for what you get - it is out of line - I ordered naked tenders which were over cooked - the small order was 8.99 and includes 4 small grilled strips - nothing comes with them! I think it is horrible that for .29 more you can get a burger with the works and fries - what???? It doesn't work in my mind.  Normally - the service is slow - even sitting at the bar. Food is often lukewarm to cold - especially the fries,  I like watching games there - I just wish there food was better!"}
{"text":"Standard Franchise/chain fare. BUT, Ray, the bartender, is below average. Someone ordered Coors Light, about three quarters thru it ran out. He moved to the Miller Lite to fill the rest. Then on numerous occasions he had a mixed drink he put in a mixer/shaker stainless glass and didn't shake it. He just turned and poured. Poor skills. Or just lazy. Not sure."}
{"text":"Since moving to the area last month, I've been trying to locate another Wings place nearby that matches up to the tasty ones from Hoagies and Wings in Sherman Oaks.  Buffalo Wild Wings can definitely fill those shoes.  There were a couple of BWW in the Valley in CA that I knew about, but I never gave them a try simply because I was already happy with the food and service at that other place.  I tend to be very loyal to a restaurant once I find one I like.    This BWW is, literally, less than a mile from our house, so we gave it a shot.  The wings were meaty, the chicken club sandwich was juicy, and the Southwestern Chicken flip that my girlfriend got was delicious.  The service was also very good, albeit a little TOO friendly at times - made it seem as if we were being served by some wings cultists looking for recruits or something.  That's not a complaint (as overly good service is always preferred over the alternative) - it's just that they didn't need to try so hard.  We've definitely found our local wings restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good for what it is. Fun atmosphere to relax as a family. Most of the waitresses are really good..especially Taryn....BUT....heard a male server(PAUL) from the bar area totally blow off some customers who said excuse me to him as he passed by.  He actually told the people they needed to wait for their waitress and he kept right on walking. The arrogance and lack of customer service is mind blowing. Luckily Paul appears to work behind the bar which is safe for those of us wanting to avoid him."}
{"text":"Very loud, but what sports themed restaurant isn't. I only wish is for a plate! Wings are always big and cooked perfect. My wife told me that she wanted, \"wings and beer\" for her valentine night out. She is my soul-mate!!!"}
{"text":"What do you call it when:  1.  You place an order for wings from their official website  2.  Get an email confirmation with the price and amount that was on the website  3.  Go for a drive to pick-up your order and then are told that you have to pay TWICE what was on the website and the email confirmation/receipt because you are not a \"member\".  Mind you, there is nothing on the website or the order confirmation that tells you this.  4.  You're told by the manager and staff there that it doesn't matter what the website says and it doesn't matter what the confirmation email says.  It only matters what they are saying.  5.  You're told that everyone else that comes in to pick-up an order accepts this policy when they are informed of THEIR policy, and pays double the price EXCEPT for you.   6.  Then while waiting for owner/management contact info, a very aggressive employee gets in your face and it takes a manager to push him away when he seems to be getting out of control, while threatening to call the police on him.   Looks like we'll be having pizza tonight"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? I used to come here several times a month for drinks and sports. Loved the bartenders. Food was as expected. During my last visit, there was all brand new staff. They were trying, but it was obvious that there was new management. Really no huge deal, but the food was just... bad. My boyfriend's flat bread was burned (waiter replaced it no problem) and the chicken strips in my wrap were super hard, dry... maybe old and then refried? It was legitimately difficult to chew. Buffalo Wild Wings has always been a bit over priced, but the inconsistency of the food the last go around makes me reluctant to return."}
{"text":"Let's talk about tv screens because they were everywhere and they were huge! Can't miss out on the action for TNF. Food came out pretty quick. I couldn't remember who our waiter was but there were a lot of servers it's impossible to not get what you need!"}
{"text":"We went there last night and I ordered a bacon cheeseburger that wasn't bad at all, but my poor wife orders the grilled chicken tenders and substituted the fries for veggies, after about 30 mins they finally bring our food out and you could instantly see the the chicken tenders were not cooked all the way, in fact they didn't looked grilled at all it was as if they put them on a fryer of like 2 mins and served them to us. So the manager took the tenders off our order but still charged us for the veggies and drink.. disaster.. will never ever go back there.. crappie service and even work cooks. Save your money"}
{"text":"We were seated outside patio area for about 20 minutes. No server came outside to greet us or serve drinks. I had to get up and let someone know we were outside and no one has been outside to take our order or offer drinks. When I stated this the server said oh I don't think the person who sat you outside told anyone you were sitting in the patio.   No apologies or discount. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered wings and Mac n cheese. I gotta say, BWW makes better mac n cheese. I also ordered strawberry kick coronanita. It's a really fun drink. I recommend it if you are eating alone and driving."}
{"text":"I normally like BWW for beer and wings but this one is pretty terrible.  The service is poor, upon arriving there was a wait, so the girl asked if we wanted inside or outside I asked what the waits were for each and she said 10 for inside and about 20 for outside.  I put us down for inside so it would come up quicker, then several people came up behind us and were seated before us, on the patio.  Weird.  So we are seated and we order  beers and appetizers (garlic mushrooms) and the mushrooms came before the beer.  And they were tiny.  I tasted no mushrooms in the breading, and I've had them before and they haven't been like that.  By the time I got my beer I was so thirsty I drank it all before my wings came.  Then my mango habenero wings came, and no beer.  So while waiting for my next beer my songs got cold.  Bad experience, bad meal, if we do ever go back to a BWW it won't be this one."}
{"text":"Ok so this was our 1st time to this particular Bdubs and it's basically the same set up every where... You got the bar area, the option to sit outside on the Patio ot indoors at the dinning area... TVs everywhere you look and so on.  Our server was a pretty young girl named Ilisia (at least thats whats on the receipt) LOL She was very nice, friendly and attentive. Our drinks where out promptly as well as our appetizers and in no time our wings where out. Over all pretty fast service.  Ilisia kept checking up on us and again was very nice. Our experience at this particular Buffalo wild wings was great! I only gave it (4) stars because they forgot out to bring out our carrots but once Ilisia was aware of that shw kept offering to being em out, since we where done there was no room for carrots. LOL  BUT YEA FAST & GOOD SERVICE ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON."}
{"text":"Wings are super delicious but the staff could be a little friendlier! They walking around all conceded... Nothing but basic bitches! Anyways service sucks but food is good!"}
{"text":"I work close to this location and stopped in for lunch. I sat at the To-Go Counter and waited..and waited. I asked for a lunch menu and was given a regular menu. I asked again and was given one. I ordered the snack boneless wings. It states on the menu a side can be chosen but the waitress argued that it will be an additional charge. The menu price is $8.49. So I only got wings with no side and paid $10.75. Needless to say I won't be returning and will tell coworkers to avoid this place as well."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the service is what gives this place FIVE STARS. I came in late late/early morning with a group of my gal pals from a night out. We were greeted as soon as we walked and and taken to a table. Nick our server was extraordinary, super helpful! He explained the items thoroughly and made sure we were comfortable and well informed before putting in all our orders.  Nick rocks! When you go this location ask for Nick and tell him Genevieve sent you!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying that I am a dedicated and long time believer of the Buffalo Wild Wings brand. I enjoy the atmosphere, the people and the food. It's truly a great environment and one of a kind.   I have spent quite a bit of time (and money) at this particular bdubs, if you will. Lately, my experiences haven't been the best and I feel that it needs to be put onto paper.   Fairly recently, I have noticed that the employees seem to be of a much lower morale. They don't seem to be the typical upbeat bartenders and servers that they usually are. One visit in particular showed me why this is, it's the management. I saw a manager openly yell at an employee and embarrass them in front of customers. This is so wrong and unprofessional on so many levels. These waiters / waitresses and bartenders are the SOLE reason I continue to come here. I can get a blue moon and some crappy wings anywhere... But the people are what make this place such a great environment! To see the managerial staff treat these folks this way, is unacceptable.   I will continue to come here but I will not support the managers of this establishment. It's unprofessional and deeply bothers me that they treat such wonderful, upbeat and energetic employees the way they do.   Please keep your eyes out for this, I do not want to have a reason to stop coming to this restaurant but if that's what it takes, I will."}
{"text":"Hostess was not interested and looked like she needed a nap...on a Tuesday at 1pm. Their saving grace were the young and energetic waiters and their lovely manager.   The low stars were for the food....the mushrooms - those that had any mushroom \"remnants\" we're still 90% breading and half of what was in the basket were just balls of fried batter.  The wings were supposed to be \"extra crispy\"....eh kinda I guess...they need lessons in timing from Wingstop. The \"hot\" wasn't really that tasty, the Asian zing was actually pretty decent....  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Austin was our server!  He was awesome!  He was friendly and based on Austin's Customer service I would come again.  I am From CA and hated Buffalo Wild Wings in CA as service was horrible.  I was very reluctant to visit as I like to be served with a smile.  Something about the CA Buffalo Wild Wings they are awful.  Austin was great!!!!!  I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very noisy location, even though its located in an area without many restaurants. Which would lead you to believe it would be relatively less crowded. You'd be wrong. Every time I have gone to this location it has been packed and there was always at least a 15 minute wait to be seated. I've always had great waitresses and the last time I was here the waitress hung around our table and talked most of the night (I guess she only had us?). Any way, it isn't wing stop, but its wings, and they give you a TON at very reasonable prices. Its always open so that's a really good thing."}
{"text":"Always dirty (floors and unbussed tables), with awful, tasteless, overpriced food.  The majority of the wait staff are either unintelligent, look filthy, are uninterested or all of the above.   The few times I've gone (because friends want to watch a game there) the food has come out wrong and had to be sent back.  One word: GROSS!"}
{"text":"Bartender was a jerk about how I wanted my drink and would not make it how i would prefer it... had to go somewhere else to get my beverages but wings were delicious as usual..."}
{"text":"For opening night of the NFL season, I followed a meetup group to Buffalo Wild Wings.  The overall experience was mediocre at best. Parking was a challenge - at first I was excited to see available spots in front of the restaurant. Despite the yellow caution tape that appeared either a tree was falling or a crime had recently taken place, the car in front of me drove through and parked. I followed the lead, only to soon discover that those spots were roped off and we had to find another parking spot. Being a busy game night, all of the remaining spots were filled in the back, the sides and even around the defunct restaurant next door. Eventually I found a spot and made my way to the front door, where I discovered much like the parking lot, nothing was available. I made my way to the bar and wedged by way betwixt two apparent regulars.   The atmosphere was naturally very loud. A restaurant with several televisions, a packed house and music during the commercials made it difficult to communicate. Looking over the large selection of beers on tap, I was excited to see some of my favorites. One of the bartenders gave a rundown of the specials and mentioned that although other things were on sale, they just tapped the Oktoberfest keg. Sounds great! How much is that? $5.50, she said. Being that it was 5:30, I was expected some happy hour prices on something. Combined with the NFL opening night, I thought surely there is a deal to be had here. How about Kilt Lifter? When she said $6, I was surprised. Some of my favorite establishments offer that brew for $2.25 during happy hour and only $4.50 at off-times. Thanks, I'll go with a Miller LIte. Perhaps there was a special because my receipt showed the first Miller Lite was $3.50, and the next two were $4.00 each. Wouldn't it be nice if bars offered drinks in economies of scale? The more you drink, the cheaper it is? But I digress...  I ordered the buffalo wings, because really, how can you go to a place called Buffalo Wild Wings and not have the Wild Wings, from Buffalo? An order of 12 wings was $8.99. Seems a little high for a 5:30 time slot. I went with the hot - and they were hot (spicy and temperature) at first, but as the temperature cooled down, I didn't notice the spice portion being that hot. Unfortunately most of the wings were about the size of a McNugget. I barely found 1-2 that I would have considered normal size. If it were a fish, I'd throw it back.   Meeting a friend, I placed an order for the ribs & shrimp combo, which set us back $12.50 and while the portion was descent, it was less impressive than the McNugget wings. The fries were good, the popcorn shrimp small but tasty, and it even had some cole slaw - surprisingly the best part of the plate. The ribs were small and didn't have a lot of meat on them - which wasn't really a bad thing because what meat was there really had no flavor whatsoever. It wasn't even that hot either. Maybe warm, but closer to room temperature. Certainly not something I would repeaidly order t for $12.50.   All in all, the challenge to find parking and a side, the loud atmosphere which reminded me why I don't like many guys, and a tab of mediocre food & drink totaling more than $35.00 for a two-three hour extravaganza, left me thinking next time I will skip it and find somewhere that provided better food and prices."}
{"text":"Beer great, service good, wings were like they had been sitting in a warmer for most of the afternoon. Can't say we would return there. Many better places for wings."}
{"text":"Ah Yes another bad chicken wing review from me why must I go places other then Duffs I should know better by now. Came here on a Thursday night at about 8 and it was really busy for the location I wouldn't really expect it to be that busy. We waited a few minutes for a table and once we were seated we began looking over the menu we decided to get the chicken tacos and and the nacho style chip and dip. We also ordered 50 Hot wings. And 2 orders of fries and 2 orders of potato wedges.   The only reason Buffalo Wild Wings even deserves one star is the chicken Tacos because everything else was just plain old SHITYYYYY! The chicken tacos were good though but not good enough for me to return for. The nachos was disgusting like warmed up cheese wiz and warm soggy tortilla chips that were left in a car in the sun in the middle of August. Just all around gross.  Now onto the wings this place is called Buffalo Wild Wings and the wings were definitely not chicken wings more like quail wings. They were tiny so tiny like microscopic there was barely any meat on the bone. This place may be good if you like those nasty flavoured wings that really have no place in society. The fries and onion wings were the size of a McDonald's small fry for $3.75 how is that even logical overall Buffalo Wild Wings is a bad establishment who clearly has never gone to Buffalo and had wings. Come on people it's not that far cross the boarder and find out what real Buffalo chicken wings are like.   Needless to say I will never be back."}
{"text":"Great wings, great fries. Kinda on the pricey side for what it is. Love the tablets for entertainment. Wish they showed PPV fights here."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Servers were so busy but calm and attentive!!! Food came out hot and fresh in a timely matter. We will def be back!!!"}
{"text":"Placed an order to go, was told it would be 10 minutes on account of our wraps. It took 45. There seemed to be only one person working the front end while the rest stood around and socialized. As we waited, we glanced around the restaurant and noticed NO ONE had any food on their tables. We found that strange, but then overheard the hostess telling incoming customers that they were free to order drinks, but the wait on food was \"over an hour.\" FOR WINGS? Never. Also, would have been nice if we had been provided that information when we walked in--we definitely would not have stayed to order. Total waste of time."}
{"text":"Another reviewer here called BW3 \"the McDonalds of wings places.\" That assessment is pretty spot-on. The wings are solid, but not particularly *good*  They've got a pretty good variety of sauces and seasonings for both traditional and boneless wings. For the gluten-free among us (hi!) all but one or two of the sauces are gluten-free if you stick with the traditional wings (though it's a mixed-use kitchen and fryers, so the super-sensitives, take note.) The sauce/seasoning situation is similar for those with dairy issues, as well.  Prices are pretty standard, so my partner and I tend to opt to pick up dinner here on Tuesdays, due to the ongoing 50% off wings promo.  The location is large, open, and LOUD, especially with all of the TVs on the walls. They've usually got trivia running on a few as well, if that's your jam. A friend of mine used to spend NCAA Championship \"season\" here every year and loved it; it gets overwhelming fast for me (or anyone else who doesn't handle sensory overload well.)  The service is hit-or-miss, erring on the side of miss, and when it is, it's pretty unapologetically so; one of the reasons we mostly get take-out these days.  They're still a decent option for fast, hot food, if I get it as takeout on Tuesdays, so I'll give them a solid \"meh.\" There are much better wing places in town these days. Spend your coin at one of them."}
{"text":"This is the best place i have been to in my life there's nothing like it the other famous wing place is Quaker steak and lube but there wings are horrible compared to buffalo wild wings"}
{"text":"By far the worst bww I have ever been to as far as the food goes. Our server was lovely and kept our drinks filled but that was about the only positive part of our meal. I ordered the street tacos like I do at my local bww but for whatever reason here they cooked my tortilla until it was basically a chip, my chicken was completely chard, and the pico was extremely scarce. I ordered 4 traditional wings which just kind fell flat. They were super fatty and over cooked and just overall disappointing."}
{"text":"This location was recently remodeled, and I think it looks great.  This review is specifically for the bar area, as that is where I normally sit.  There are fewer TV's, but the TV's that are there are newer and larger.  I especially love the setup behind the bar.  All new tables and chairs (with seat backs) too.  It's just a far more cleaner and modern look. Sometimes less is more, and that is nicely exhibited in this recent remodel."}
{"text":"Was just in this restaurant and my credit card was declined.  They really need to use chip cards. I just used at two other establishments in Kent. Get a clue. Very unhappy"}
{"text":"If you need a good wing fix this is the place to come.  Between four people we shared a large boneless wings. You are able to get 4 different sauce choices so it was nice to have options and try different sauces.  Boneless wings were good size. Didn't need to order any sides since it comes with carrots and celery sticks and really after eating wings covered in yummy sauce dipped in your dressing choice (blue cheese or ranch) you should really eat something healthy lol.   Non-alcoholic beverages are quite large, probably around 24-32 ounces so plenty to help wash down your food.  There is a good happy hour menu with different drink specials but I would just stick to a beer, goes best with their food options.  Service was no superior by any means but it is a quick fix dinner and I wasn't expecting anything but average.   Atmosphere was fine, a bit crowded but it was during happy hour around 6:30pm. Place seemed pretty clean."}
{"text":"Best wings place to take out, which is perfect for us ad we dont have time to dine out. I like their sauces and hamburgers as well. Their wings go well with beers. It is unfortunate that they eliminated half wing Tuesday deals but their rewards program work great."}
{"text":"Food was alright for the price, service was good but i think the taste of the food could definitely be better."}
{"text":"We went there on boneless Thursday and the price was good but service was horrible. They were \"out of\" everything I wanted including 4 beers they listed on there draft list and there featured wing sause. So I will never go to this bw3s ever again"}
{"text":"Pretty much you run of the mill BW3's. Friendly bartender but an introduction or name tag would have been nice. She was attentive and informed me of their wing special which wasn't advertised. The food arrived quickly, which hasn't always been the case at many BW3s. Overall 3 stars but compared to the other BW3s I visited, it was better than most."}
{"text":"My son was craving wings so we gave this place a try. The wings were decent and the service was fine, but I just can't get over how dark and dingy the restaurant was. I felt that they needed to keep it dark to hide how dirty and run down the place is. The floors were in really rough shape and in desperate need of a good vacuuming and steam-cleaning. I doubt that I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, it's currently Monday night, yes it's a little busy, but the bar wasn't crazy, I'm a bartender so I understand that maybe the well had been crazy, but then again that's why you have two bartenders behind the bar, one for the well and the customers sitting at the bar. We came in a girl, her name was Callie, gave my boyfriend and I our drinks, about five minutes later I received a phone call and told him to order for me while I took my call outside, I return almost 20 minutes later he says that neither the girl that gave us our drinks or the guy, Nate, had looked his way since I left. About five minutes after that Callie finally takes our order, she gets my order wrong, because she did not write it down, it happens, I ate it, didn't complain, and we sat there for another 20 minutes as Nate, walked to and from his POS system and ignoring every customer at the bar unless they yelled and waved for him, he even made eye contact with us in the mirror behind the POS and still ignored me, it's seemed as though Callie was now at the well and Nate was suppose to be in charge of customers at the bar. Get it together. Either get some better bartenders that can actually handle the well themselves instead of a all hands on deck mentality. Because every customer actually sitting at that bar received terrible service if any at all."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has less than 3 stars. I've been coming here for 15 years! Service has always been good and food is consistent. Everybody knows bdubs isn't a bargain, but its not the staff or locations fault. You know what you are getting into....  but for what it is, I always get treated well here. Machines are back up and the current kitchen staff is killing it!"}
{"text":"Buffalo's has got the glossy new coat, stadium bright lighting, well trained staff, TV's with every sports broadcast....and horrible food.  For a place that has \"wings\" in the name....why aren't the wings a selling point? And unlike every other place, wing nights are not on Wednesdays. Chicken tenders? Dry chicken, horrible batter. Plum sauce tastes like chemicals.  I ended up having a full fledged affair with my salad...and I hate salad. It was the least suckiest thing at the table to eat.  Took a peep through a swinging door and saw the most glorious kitchen ever. Too bad they don't actually make anything themselves. Everything comes from a deep freeze bag, sauces mixed from packages. Given a million dollar kitchen and you can't even bread your own chicken, marinate your own wings. Shame.  But every cloud has a silver lining. The service was excellent. And apologetic (and also knew what I was talking about when I said it tasted like chemicals). Bartender kept our drinks filled, server gave us a coupon to come back. All the games I wanted to watch were on, without having to flip channels, or pick and choose. Excellent.  We ended up filling up our bellies with beer and writing off the food.  Growing pains? Maybe. Will I be back? For the TVs, and the drinks. But I will surely eat before I come.  Review #5 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu. Decent wings with a wide selection of sauce choices.   Bonus - NTN Trivia!! :)"}
{"text":"This place was outstanding. Tried the triple threat nachos, unbelievable! The boneless wings also excellent. Our server was Savannah as the service also couldn't have been better. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Clean, not too much of a wait time. Friendly staff. Love going during football season. Always order togo since its near work as well. Orders are mostly accurate."}
{"text":"Been waiting for my food for 30 min. I need another drink. I guess not. 20% tip to 10%.  Sorry!?"}
{"text":"The best BWW I have ever been too, and have been to quite a few.  The place is spotless, the service was great and the food was served quickly and hot.   Great place to go near the baseball stadium."}
{"text":"Great service!  Come here every Wednesday with kids before karate class!   Love this place!  Waiters and waitresses are true professionals!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. Most recently, we stopped by after watching the Rebels win their only victory so far this season - a 45-10 thumping of lowly New Mexico. Or as I sometimes call them - Used Mexico... or Certified Pre-Owned Mexico. I kid.  There's not much to say. This is your standard BWW. The wings are pretty good but really nothing special in the end. Despite there being a huge party of middle-school-aged kids in the house, the service was still good.  I would return if it's suggested, but BWW isn't usually my choice of spots."}
{"text":"Good food. Prices aren't great, but not ridiculous. The so called mild wings are actually very spicy."}
{"text":"Lots of dirty tables. No service. Three other parties walked out too. Management at this location is not paying attention."}
{"text":"I'll have to agree with Jennie q. Review.  Food isn't anything spectacular.  Be careful when you get take out and double check your order.  They have ticked me off more than once.  Called and went back for correct order and they still fu c ked it up.   I stick with the Buffalo Chicken wrap lunch.  Anything else I've tried has bed dry or overcooked.  We tried their fried pickles for an appetizer and it was disgusting and extremely greasy. At least we got it taken off the bill.   The atmosphere is nice though.    I'm sure I'll be back until I'm pushed to my limit lol  Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to enjoy a cold beer and bar food. Tuesdays and Thursdays they have wings specials.   Wings Tuesday and  Boneless Thursday.  great Atmosphere and perfect place to watch UFC fights or football games for free"}
{"text":"The wings are good.  Thats why people come here.  Everything else on their menu is terrible. The service is terrible. Every time I go to a Buffalo Wild Wings they always seem to be slow and overall unhelpful.  I don't understand why. I've been to three so far and its always bad service.  Anytime I ask them a question about their menu, they get annoyed and rude.  Also every time I get my food its cold. Why don't they care more?  If you eat, just do takeout and save yourself a bad experience."}
{"text":"Food was good. We were charged two extra beers that we did not have. Tried to correct it, so the waitress called over the manager and all he did was insist that it's correct. We went over what beers we had in order, it was 10 beers, but we were charged for 12. The waitress was awesome but sucks we were charged $15 for things we did not have. Probably won't back ever again. If you go and are here for a long period of time drinking and watching the games, keep track of what you order because mistakes can be made to your bill."}
{"text":"If you're going to run with 1 bartender during your happy hour or any hour, maybe she should be strong enough to handle the 4 tables and 3 bar patrons??? Just food for thought BWW. Would have spent more money but didn't have the chance bc the service sucked so bad. Fail."}
{"text":"Visited this place looking for a quick bite to eat on a day out with my mom and we got just what we were looking for. ....the food was okay and the prices were good for what we got.  I had the tacos and they were pretty good but my mom had the burger and didn't say many good things about it.  The waitress was very nice and food came out quickly.  Overall it is a good place to stop in for a quick bite to eat but probably not much more than that."}
{"text":"I had never been to a BWW before so when this brand spanking new one opened just down the street from me, I had every reason to check it out.   It's a good looking sports bar with tons of TVs. The restaurant is split between a bar area and dining room area. The dining area consists of tables and booths but way more tables. Naturally, the beer selection is ample but not super impressive.  The menu has a lot of options from greasy bar favorites to gluten free rabbit food.   Speaking of greasy bar food - the fried pickles are awesome.   But let's focus on the wings for a second.   We all know they come in bone-in or boneless and that there's like 20 different flavors.  They serve wings by weight with serving sizes of large, medium, or small - our waitress led us to believe this was fairly recent change from selling by traditional dozens. I'm down with that.   Now if there's anything I want a reader to take away from this review, it's this: the Mango Habenero sauce is extremely hot. It's the 3rd spiciest according to the menu but our waitress said despite that it's probably the hottest. She was not lying. Basically, if you value your tongue and lips in the slightest, pass on these. They were just too damn hot - it gave me flashbacks of my Habenero Burger from Carlsbad Tavern. The mango did not come through at all.   Aside from that, the thai curry, and medium sauces were delicious. As I said earlier the pickles rocked and my draft New Castle was nice and cold.   Service overall was phenomenal - helpful and attentive.  I'm sure I'll be back at some point, it's a great place to watch a game.  Oh and they do that Buzztime trivia game, but instead of those cheesy game pads of old they are using nice looking 7inch tablets."}
{"text":"I'm 30 years old, and my fiancé couldn't believe that I've never, ever tried B-Dubs in my entire life, so he treated me for St. Paddy's Day to my first ever B-Dubs experience. Since it was Boneless Wing Thursday, we each had a few honey barbecue wings before our meal, and ohmigosh the honey barbecue sauce was so good, I was practically licking the sauce off the wings before eating them. For my first meal, I tried the Big Jack Daddy Burger...WOW! I was so very much in love! Hickory smoked pulled pork and onion rings on a burger, it was super delicious! Definitely will have to return sometime!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!! Messed up our order, made us pay the extra amount, did not receive a single apology and everyone was blaming their coworkers behind their backs. Just a bad experience altogether."}
{"text":"I love BWW. It sounds so bad, but they are decently allergy friendly! BWW has a detailed allergen menu online and I have not had any reactions from any allergens (I'm allergic to dairy, dairy by-products, fish, and shellfish).   If you have dairy allergies, egg allergies, or seafood allergies, BWW is a good option for dining out. Yay!  I came here several times with my husband to watch a few football games (Go Hawks!) and it was a nice atmosphere with lots of families and no threat of people getting angry with one another in the restaurant with opposing teams winning or losing (i.e. You won't have to really worry about someone picking a fight with you if you're rooting for a certain team).  There are lots of large flat screen TVs situated around the restaurant, and if a certain screen isn't showing a specific game, you can ask your server to put on a specific game - just remember to give them the number of the TV screen which is on a little white sticker at the bottom left/right corner.  Because I'm a creature of habit, I always order the same thing, and I've never had any issues with cross contamination at this BWW or the BWW in Morgantown, WV. The chips and salsa are super yummy, and the chips are served warm and is large enough to serve 2-3. Sodas are also refilled constantly and the servers are pretty attentive, even when it's pretty busy.   All in all, BWW is a great place to catch a game and eat some wings with your friend, family, or significant other. ALSO, they have awesome Wi-fi and you can request for the gaming tablets if you or your kids want to play games."}
{"text":"Came here with the co-workers for a happy hour (despite it's illegality in Charlotte = ridiculous)  but none-the-less I prepared myself for a couple good drinks and some wings of course.  We had two servers - one just left or something part way through without telling us she would no longer be our server. It seemed painfully obvious that she did not really want to be there and was very slow overall. Perhaps she was having a bad day.The second did a much better job and he was polite.   They had two \"specials\" $5 fat tires and $3.50 tall boy coors lights (Thursday). They also have 60 cent boneless wings.  The drinks were fine the wings kind of lackluster. One of our boneless bites didn't actually have meat in it - just breading. I tried several flavors but I enjoyed the bbq best- they are not shy with the spice factor so hot is hot .Living in Buffalo makes me a huge wing snob so my expectations were not particularly high in the first place.   My meal and drink was $10- not too bad.Overall even though id have better I would go back but probably not on my own accord.   Also parking is a huge pain- better off taking the light rail in or preparing for a little walk if you don't want to pay the $6 parking fee."}
{"text":"So Ive been to BWW a few times but living in Buffalo has made me completely spoiled when it comes to wings so Ive avoided it as much as possible.  After a night of climbing my boyfriend suggested we go there- and I agreed as I figured I would give something else besides wings a chance.  I was in the mood for something light- a chicken salad...how hard is that to mess up ?   ...well after a ridiculously long wait for a salad - approximately an hour later our server came out to apologize sighting the need to DEFROST some chicken for our salads as the reason for the long wait. Nothing like Microwave Defrosted Chicken to wet the appetite.   So we get our salads- I had the Honey BBQ Chicken Salad...  The lettuce was the mixed bag kind of ice burg w/the carrots and cabbage...blah- tossed with those cheap-o tiny croutons and chicken that tasted like- well really processed tiny chickeny-cubes. The BBQ Sauce was good but it became a little too much by the time I worked through half of the salad.  I am being completely honest when I say that I have had MUCH better salads at McDonalds.   Our service was mediocre at best- and the temperature in the venue itself was way too cold for me. They did have karaoke that night which seemed to have a larger following so it might be cool if you like that.    I will not be going back ( Go to Tavern on Tracks or Township Grill - also heard good things about Lebowski's if you want REAL Buffalo wings : ) ) ...and go pretty much anywhere else and you'll get a better salad!"}
{"text":"The place was pretty empty today which was food for me.  The waitress was very attentive, I didn't have to ask for another drink she kept them coming.  The food was good, the wings were well done.  The only thing I didn't appreciate was that the wings were the same price for less.  The large use to be 20 wings now it comes with 18 wings wth.  How do u down size?  Let me upgrade you!  Yea that was a shocker especially since only 2 wings were bigger than the rest.  Hmmph!  Wasn't too happy about that!"}
{"text":"So went to this BWW with hesitation, but we were hungry and after 35 mins the order was wrong and we didn't want anything after that but the Manager Melanie was very pleasant which I appreciated and is rare these days.  She tried to make up for it but I was so over it! Anyway good customer service from a manager is why it got 3 stars.  Thanx Melanie!!"}
{"text":"So Natasha is the bomb!! She is very attentive, great customer service which i love. She made sure our food was on time and just right.  She was able to take our order and make it just right.  She even paid attention to the flavors i wanted and the ones my husband wanted then split them up on our individual plates. She made up for me being unhappy the last couple of times.  Thanks!  Customer service at it's finest."}
{"text":"First time at this location and a long time since visiting any bw3 location. Now I remember why I've stayed away. Sat down at the bar and put money in playing $1 video poker. Ordered a grey goose and soda which was delivered with no issues. Ordered a second drink (down $600 at this point) and was told only absolut or Smirnoff could be comped. Why even give the first drink without letting me know? When I questioned the bartender I was told this location does not have enough gaming activity and there have been cutbacks. Whatever the reason, this does not seem how you want to treat people who are gaming in your establishment.  Just now asked if I could have some food to take home and was told she would have to ask the manager. This place is going to be run into the ground."}
{"text":"Thanks for not trying to better accommodate a group of 15.  We are now separated into 3 tables.  When your employees managed to put 4 tables together, the manager came by and split us up again. We just cancelled our appetizers and will not be ordering any more alcoholic beverages.  Your loss on what would have been a good table.    And I am now editing this because it has been 40 minutes and half our group got their food.  Our table of 9 is still waiting for dinner.    So for all of the inconvenience we got a certificate for wings.  The manager Scott is completely useless.  In the process we had water and ranch spilled on one guest.    This place is horrible!!  Unacceptable!!"}
{"text":"Stay away!! This place is horrific, horrible service. Came here with  the family. Almost everything we ordered came went back. Im highly allergic to cabbage notified the waitress of this,  she brings me cabbage  I tell her that I told you Im allergic she comes back with will its not cabbage its cole slaw!!!!!  Really anyways just stay away. The manager Mark  was very nice  and took care of us. But service from waitress horrible."}
{"text":"Love the wings. Like the chain. This store needs help! Bartender was nice enough, but not at all engaged in service! She sat at a table apart from the bar obviously busy with her phone. She occasional would come back to the bar w/ her ear buds still in, and ask from a distance if I \"needed anything\"? I had to ask for napkins, water, dipping sauce, etc.... & My check!  As I write, I read a few other reviews,.... No manager in sight, and this place definitely needs an effective manager."}
{"text":"Strange vibe the personnel seem to act as though they are doing you a favor. No smiles no kind greetings at the bar just a \"what can I get you?\" If you ask for something extra like a to go box you get a slight hiss or roll of the eyes while they socialize with other staff members. I'm at a point in my life where I say it like it is if this is the way you feel you should be treated when you spend your money by all means this is the place for you."}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving home from a night on the town and tried calling in an order so we could pick it up and take it home to eat. When we called this location, there was no way to reach them because you'd just get a fax machine sound when you dialed. We called another location to confirm the number and they said it was correct and they were sorry we couldn't reach them. We then drove to BWW to place our order because we figure wings won't take too long anyway, right?! Wrong. The bartender informs us when we tell him about the phone that he wouldn't have been able to take our order anyway because after midnight you must be there in person before they start making your order. Ok,...nbd because we were already there, but that still doesn't fix the annoying phone issue. We placed our order with the bartender and then he disappears out the back door, leaving it wide open right behind us and it was cold as all get out that night so we had to get up and move so we weren't frozen. Well, 23 minutes later (with an empty bar and no other food orders other than the people who came in after us), we start pacing past the kitchen. The bartender was still not inside. I see the kitchen put our order up and we wait,...longer. We finally get our food once the bartender comes back inside and takes off his coat and whatnot. We get home and finally get to eat the long awaited wings and they are completely over cooked, dry, and hard to eat. We threw away most of them because they were so dry. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. That's what happens when you cook wings for close to 20 minutes! Won't be back to this location. I'd suggest driving to another one if you're looking for great wings."}
{"text":"Super pissed off they are not showing the UFC fights tonight I drove from surprise to here to see them and when I get here nope not playing them I'm soooo pissed"}
{"text":"Food was average.  Got the wing combo.  The boneless chicken was very tough.  Even hard to cut with a knife .   Service was really bad.  Got seated on patio.  Sat for 20 minutes .  Never saw a waiter.  So went and set at bar.  Service better but not by much .  Took forever to get second beer.  And the two bartenders didn't like each other.  One of them (Katelyn) was walking around complaining about the other and every other word was a cuss word.  Then it took forever to pay out and they were not busy at all.  Not a great place."}
{"text":"I always get the same thing every Buffalo Wild Wings I go to. Ive tried other things on the menu and  I stick with 6 HOT and 6 Medium Wings (traditional)and a tall Coors Lite.  Stick with what you like.Sit at the bar, play some trivia. I went on a weekday in the daytime at the bartender took good care of me"}
{"text":"Disgusted in the take out at this restaurant. If you want to spend money on take out do yourself a favor and find somewhere else. They forget your sauces, the GM at this restaurant Andrew is rude and could care less there was a problem with our order.  Thanks for literally nothing."}
{"text":"Let me start off with this, the employees there are great. The food, the prices and the fact that they took out the fire pit on the patio makes this place absolutely passable ever damn time. The draw is to come watch sports. I have satellite for that, and I can actually stomach the food I cook at home or order out. I know what a novel concept. The burgers are ground up trash that taste like they came straight from a garbage disposal. There wings are whatever, nothing special there. The menu is a big sign of worrying more about quantity over quality. Word to the wise, don't sacrifice quality. This place is nothing special and seems to be content with that."}
{"text":"Tonight Buffalo Wild Wings was an example of being at the right place at the right time. It would be my debut post-hiking supper of the new year. Usually when I hike, additional mileage is added parking in a busy shopping center where my vehicle is away from isolation. This Buffalo Wild Wings happens to be in a Von's shopping center that has a unique distinction of being the gateway to miles of hiking in the Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area. Following seven hours of hiking on twelve miles of trails, I was so hungry that anything looked good. It was a good deal that I had parked near Buffalo Wild Wings.       When I walked inside around 7:30 on a Sunday night it was moderately busy. The hostess asked me if I wanted to sit at the bar or at a booth. The last thing I wanted after seven hours of hiking was a beer. That would really knock me out. The waitress walked me to the closer room with the tables. As I waited for the waiter, I would be totally exhausted not to realize that this is a bar and grill that just happens to be known for their chicken wings. All around me there were television sets playing professional sports. I counted 22 of them. I also counted on fulfilling my post-hiking appetite.       I decided on the buffalo chicken ranch sandwich. There was a slight miscommunication because the waiter thought I meant the chicken ranch chicken wrap. Fast forward to when I saw the Buffalo chicken ranch wrap, I was going to bite in. I was so hungry that I could eat anything and used this situation as an opportunity to try something new. Again, this was an example of being at the right place at the right time. After trying something new, I learned that I am favorable toward the buffalo chicken ranch wrap. The tortilla loaded with buffalo chicken tenders, medium sauce, ranch dressing, cheeses, lettuce, and tomato was good food that was slowly making my appetite passe. The large onion rings and bottomless Pepsi complimented the Buffalo ranch chicken wrap. If I wasn't up for onion rings I could of ordered fries or for an additional 50 cents potato wedges. The one complaint I have with the wrap was that it failed to hold the food together causing a good amount to spill onto the plate. The buffalo ranch chicken wrap, onion rings, and Pepsi came to $13 and change.       The service was decent. I did have to ask for napkins. At the end, the server who was generally quiet started chatting with me about the Galaxy S5 book I had brought with me. Having a conversation with the waiter leaves a positive impression on the service.       In conclusion, this Buffalo Wild Wings is neither poor nor great. It is good. Probably the next time I visit a Buffalo Wild Wings will be to try the new one on the Las Vegas Strip. As far as this location, I don't see myself going out of my way to return here soon. But then again, my appetite might lead me back sooner than I think when I return from another exhausting hiking adventure in the nearby trails of the Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my least fav places to eat and it's so close to my so that stinks. Went today for lunch with my parents and kids. Food took very long to get so you'd think it would be hot and fresh.... Not a chance. The wings were squishy and slimy and my burger was cold and bun was hard on the top. Yuck I vow to never return, it's always been junk and it never gets better.. I will say this though the waitress was slow but friendly."}
{"text":"After reading reviews from this place I was hesitant to try it but it was on my way home from school so I thought, just pick up some wings, how can they do wrong?  Well first impressions were great, employees were nice and friendly, the cashier even gave me free wing cards.  After leaving, I was anticipating a good review, but I was disappointed.  The cards expired in a day. My wings had no sauce on them, they were plain! I also requested flats only and that was not the case.  Boo!"}
{"text":"Wings and huge TVs showing sports. Sounds like a quality lunch spot to me.  To save time I usually call in my order ahead of time, then plan my arrival at the restaurant for when they predict my food will be ready. Servers are always nice and don't mind splitting checks, which is nice since I'm usually at BWW with co-workers. The prices are great if you go on Traditional Wing Tuesday or Boneless Wing Thursday."}
{"text":"Generally good service and great variety of sauces. Managers always step up to resolve any issues"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!! Came in last week to watch the UFC fight and we had a good time. So we decided to do the same last night first of all we called to make sure they had the fight we wanted on and they said they did. So off we went... Lol walked in waited 20 min to get seated they said oh just let us know where you sit and we'll change it to the fight we said ok. We sat down and nope no fight. They said they don't have that channel. We'll that sucks that's why we came in. We were upset about it but we still stayed like what can we do nothing now but eat. Ordered 3 apps may I mention it was 4 of us. Ordered a bucket of wedges fully loaded and they came out fries I told our server that they we're suppose to be wedges as I pointed them to her when I ordered from the menu but no she said I ordered fries. Okay....ordered the pizza flatbread it was the worst flatbread ever so I passed it along to see if anyone else would eat it. Lol but no luck they seriously spit it out. So we wanted to just ordered something else but server never came so we decided to leave because it was just being all bad. Check got dropped off but it was unfair to pay for sometime no one liked. So we decided to talk to a manager but he walked up asking so what happened so I told him it's been a bad experience from the start about the fight never being on and he said I quote \" I've been working here for 30 years and never once has a boxing match been on\". So me I pointed at the big screen behind him and showed that there was a boxing fight on. He was just in wow!! I explained to him how the food was not good at all but just looked at me like I'm some cheap person trying to get a free meal when it wasn't that as a manager he needs to make sure customers are happy and we weren't. But he just had a really rude response to everything I said, including that the pizza was gone when we seriously tried two little slices and the rest was left at the table. So to make himself feel better he gave me 3 dollars back because we ate half the pizza he said. I was just in wow. That being said I'll never be back here again!"}
{"text":"Come here every Sunday for the football game.   2-3 stars for the food. 1 star for the staff. The staff have bad hygiene and assume that all customers are their best friends. Very loud and invading.   It doesn't seem like some of the staff really like their jobs.    Watching the bartender make drinks is disgusting. She wipes her nose and then touches the rim of the glass. Then smelled the drink before giving it to the customer."}
{"text":"When I was pregnant I would come here just about every other week because I would crave it. Girls in the front were always very nice and gave me glasses of ice water while I waited for my to go order! Love Buffalo Wild Wings!!!"}
{"text":"Come here if you want to freeeze your butt off. Air conditioning to like 50 degrees when it's 68 outside. Good place to come on a very hot day though. Food and drinks are great."}
{"text":"This is my Sunday evening craving buster. I can get a good walk in because it's close to home and fill the void with some decent fried chicken and beer.  They have a long list of sauces from no spice at all on up to burning fire. Pick your wings and pick a sauce. I'm no fan of super spicy but Honey BBQ (my personal favorite) is in the middle of the spice-o-meter and it's not even a baby kick. I like to try out anything new on tap and they have a fairly extensive selection both there and in bottles. Not sure the total number but on tap it looks like about 15-20 beers all the time. Plenty of local options too, which I consider a plus.  For the bad, I was fairly unimpressed with the hostess stand and responsiveness. When you come in, without fail there will be 1) nobody in sight near the stand 2) somebody there with their back turned and talking to a coworker not giving a crap or 3) somebody there just staring at you as if to ask \"why'd you come here?\"  My advice, if your group is small, is to just skip all that crap and bee-line for the bar. CC (the bartender) has never done me wrong. She keeps my glasses full, my wings aplenty and carries a steady conversation. If you're in a group, get drunk that way you won't know how bad the service was..."}
{"text":"This is the worst B dubs I have ever been to in my life. I've been here with my family before and we got up and left because we waited over an to get our food when we were the only 12 people in the restaurant.   Today I just ordered take out for two people. They said the wait would be 35 minutes, it's now past that.   I asked the lady where I sit with my little nephew by my side, and she tells me anywhere other then the bar. I ask her by because I sit with kids in the bar area all the time in Colorado, and she did not have an answer. I asked her if I could ask the manager, and they just stood there.   An hour later and they don't care to offer a drink while we wait, let alone for get the drink that comes with a kids meal. This location is not worth it. EVER."}
{"text":"Changed their gambling policy again!!!. No reason to ever have a beer there. I gamble often there I think I like there food at times. I love no smoking. If u don't gamble this won't make sense.  You have to cash out and then add more money each time so that machines can see you add money to get the cocktail comps.  So today's experience gamble or put in $ 40 goes up to 80 should have cashed out but I don't know their rules goes to $26 ask for bill after about an hour I get a bill for 1 beer and a bottle of water.   WHAT. Why.  So pay for DRINKS AND TIP $20 not servers total fault maybe should of said something . Will never ever go there again  BWW will not get my money ever again."}
{"text":"Bleh. The Thai curry wings were not very good. The burger was ok, the fried pickles were chewy, the garlic mushrooms weren't very garlicy and the batter on the inside was not thoroughly cooked. Honestly I can't remember the last time I had a good meal there. The menu still shows apple pie and cheesecake though they no longer sell it."}
{"text":"This became the venue of choice because we wanted to watch World Cup Soccer.  They do have quite the selection of TVs to watch; that's for certain.  I'm just not all that into the food selection of messy wings and fried \"stuff\" without other options being available that at least get my attention.  I poured over the menu for quite some time before landing on popcorn shrimp and slaw instead of fries.  That should do it, I thought.  Ugh... Not to be so.  The shrimp didn't resemble shrimp anymore after they deep fried it to death and then some.    I didn't mean to complain to my server but she asked.  So, I honestly said I didn't like them.  She said no problem; she'd get the manager.  He came over and handled if very well.  He very cordially offered to get me something else, to which I said very politely \"no thanks\" and I just finished my slaw.    So, why am I giving it 3 stars and not lower?  Because, I realize it IS a wings venue, after all.  I can't just go hating it because they have what they advertise.  And, both my server and the manager handled the situation with grace and the shrimp was deducted from my bill without my even asking them to do that.    Will I be back?  Eh, maybe to watch a sports event I crave."}
{"text":"We have the worst experience each and every time we go. We will wait several weeks before giving them another try and like clockwork, a terrible experience. You make wings all day everyday and to ask for a modification on wing night backs up 800 wings? Piss poor explanation for piss poor service. At least the worst waitress ever wasn't there tonight. She needs a couple days off to adjust her attitude. Will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Dirty floors/tables all around the restaurant. There was plenty of staff here, yet no initiative to clean up I guess. I'd think twice about eating here..if it's dirty in the dinning area I can only imagine what it looks like in the kitchen area.  Our waitress seemed annoyed when we would ask her for something and even mentioned that the food didn't taste fresh and had to take it back."}
{"text":"Coming back in for another boneless Thursday. Started off with the Irish wedges which we really liked last. This time they were made better and really layered with the cheese and not just heaped on top which was better than last time, the only downside was last time we had onion dip and this time we had a honey bbq type thing. Definitely ask for onion dip because it makes it WAY better. Lemon pepper wings were good but the Parmesan garlic seem to always be covered in sauce. Either way it was good food and the service was good. Also all the tvs keep kids of all ages entertained which is always nice.  Overall we keep coming back because the service and the food are consistent and good."}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent, had the chicken with the Caribbean Jerk sauce and good as usual.  Got the buffalo chips with cheese and Cajun seasoning to go with it and that was tasty.  The waitress we had, Katarina, was super attentive and provided excellent service."}
{"text":"I was in a party of 4 and they could only find playmakers for 3 of us for the first 20 minutes. When we signed on, it was only us. If nobody else was playing, then where were the playmakers? It also took them forever to change a tv for us. Also, for a place that serves spicy food, they don't stay up with the drinks very well. From what I get from everybody else, go to the one in Kent."}
{"text":"Love the lemon pepper if you are in the mood for a dry rub! BBQ mango mashup is a new flavor, really dig it. Pretty spicy but not too bad! Their happy hour is spectacular!! This waitress is awesome she gave us great recommendations and was very nice. Loved her great attitude and how helpful she was. Kudos to Kendra!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 20 wings, with sauce on the side, on wing special Tuesday (I think each wing is .60c) and a large order of fries. Picked up my order and the to go person asked how many sauces I wanted on the side, I said we usually get 3. Seems about the right amount for 20 wings, right? Nope! They give you 1 side of sauce and charge you for any additional. New policy apparently? I told the to go person there was no way 1 side of sauce would cover 20 wings. The manager comped the 2 additional sides this time.  We eat here all the time and order to go all the time, never been charged extra?!? Oh well, my husband made some wings & fries at home and my family thought they were better than BWW. Looks like they lost some regular customers. I do love their spicy garlic sauce though!"}
{"text":"These people get zero stars... I think the only good thing was the wait was only 5 min... so here's the scoop. Was sat in 5 min (was happy) sat down asked about happy hour and the waitress says \"oh we usually don't do that unless you ask us to\" then my relatives (from germany) order beer and she asks for their ID. Mind you they are in their late 40s... they hand over the ID and the lady says... \"oh sorry we can't take IDs from other countries\" are you kidding??? This is Vegas! !! Most people out here aren't american!! Needless to say we left and I will never take anyone here again. On to the next one."}
{"text":"My husband and I just walked out without bothering to order anything.  We sat down at a half booth half table in the bar next to a large party and were greeted by a young man named Aaron.  He immediately told us the table was reserved as the party next to us had more people coming...thats funny I didn't know you could reserve tables in a bar during HH.  So here I am 9 months pregnant told to get up and move to an uncomfortable high top.  My husband mentions that if a table is reserved it should have signs on it so people don't sit down and have to move.  Instead of saying Im sorry or I'll let a manager know Aaron decides to get snappy and tell us we should just get there earlier next time. Thanks Aaron, we'll keep that in mind when we go anywhere but this Buffalo Wild Wings location.  As we got up to leave he sarcastically said goodbye and proceeded to be argumentative with my husband when he told him that his customer service skills were seriously lacking. Its a shame because we live right down the street and used to come here 2-3 times a month."}
{"text":"Our server tried her best with a party of 10. But we came in 20 minute wait. Party of 8 who came in 7mins after we did was sat before us. Once we wherr finally sat 10 mins after the party who came in after we waited another 45 mins for food. When a server Stephanie (not ours) finally brought our food i asked where the rest was. With an attitude she yells i only have 2 hands and can only carry 1 try turns and stomps off not only is that rude but very disrespectful. I see the manager Mike come out a few minutes later talking to the 2 host at the greeters stand who immediately turn and look at my table 1 at a time. Not 1 time did Mike the manager come ask was everything ok. I went to Mike before leaving to ask the servers name after getting a card for corporate he told me the girls name and still didnt ask what was going on. Never will i come back to this place!! To be disrespected and embarrassed is not how i want to spend and evening for a 16yr olds birthday.!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service.  Our Las Vegas Texas A&M Club  watches Aggie football games at BWWINGS and we have been treated like royalty.  The management of this store has even gone so far as to get pay-per-view when one of our games was not on regular TV.  The food and beer are served promptly.  I would also like to take this chance to nominate Stephanie as the best server in America.  She truly makes our game watching experience special."}
{"text":"Visited here late Sunday night, wasn't busy so no wait. Anthony and Nicole were so nice to me and my husband. They let us sample beers and the Asian zang was really good. Great place to go."}
{"text":"Not what I expected.  I must said that I order some water, that tasted like chlorine. Yes I did let them know.  But I wasn't impressed by the food. Nothing special and the servers where in the moon!! We never got any refills or a check up while eating."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Watered down cocktails, sampler appetizer was terrible, burger was overcooked and tested disgusting. One of the worst meals I've ever had in Charlotte. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"First I would like to say that the only reason why I'm giving a 2 star instead of 1 is because they have good food. Now to the experience. It took a little bit for us to get noticed by the hostess. After a few of the staff walked passed us finally some of then asked if we have been helped yet. I would assume that if our group of 3 was standing at the hostess check in booth someone would notice us. Finally we went to the bar area to sit. It took about 10 mins after sitting down for the server to finally ask us if we wanted drinks. We asked if there were any specials which there was but the server didn't tell us about it. Then after taking our drink order she never came back. She did clean the tables around us and helped all the other guests but didn't seem to remember that we were trying to order food as well. Once she did come back she took our order and tried to rush away without taking my girlfriends order. I had to call her back and say my girlfriend would like some food as well. So basically the service was horrible, the food was good and I will probably try another location next time unless I can be assured by a manager that we will all be noticed next time"}
{"text":"we were here for the dragon boat race this past weekend at the Tempe town lake... and there were couple hours gap between our 1st race and 2nd race... so..... what do we do? we... drink.  the fish tacos i ordered were excellent.. i asked for both sauces but really the tarter sauce was much better...   bravo to the bartender... she was cute and attentive... when we were debating if we should down the 2nd glass fast so we could get a 3rd one when there were only 20 mins left... she was giving us her honest opinion that... it was about 12pm noon and it might get hot, we might get dehydrated if we still need to race later... oh well, we still ordered one more! she was so considerate and gave us all iced water to go... just for that we'd go back IF we are ever in town again! (sigh, forgot her name!)."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spot too eat at and always stop here when we are in town and place is always clean and the staff is friendly always and we tried the all u can eat wings and hubby really enjoyed it and we got a pound of peel n eat shrimp, omg I love that shrimp and we don't mine coming back here too eat again when we are in town."}
{"text":"Um.... yeah. A group of my coworkers and I went to this location last Friday during our lunch hour. We walked through the doors at ten after eleven. Our party of six stood at the front for nearly ten minutes (the place had a few tables, but wasn't in a full-tilt lunch rush, yet.) before a server noticed us and led us to a table.   We put in our orders and then waited... and waited... While the place filled up with a typical Scottsdale lunch crowd.  How long does it take to make wings and fries? I actually know, from working in restaurants back in college. I takes about eight minutes, from fryer to plate.   The plates hit the table at about five after noon. The company I work for has an hour lunch. We ended up staying and eating, but everyone was late getting back, and we were all thoroughly annoyed. However, because a manager knocked 50% off our tabs for the inconvenience, and the wings (when they appeared) were actually decent, I didn't enter a negative review at that time.  So... I forgot all about it, until today. One of my co-workers noticed that  his bank was charged more than he signed for at that lunch. Not a lot - but wtf?  Never again; steer clear - unless a long wait and minor fraud are your thing. Nobody's wings are good enough to put up with that bs."}
{"text":"This location of Buffalo wild wings has gone down hill. I had a carry out order today. The wraps were very undersized and when they brought them out it look like they used there hands to cut them in half. I had to send them back. Very over priced and the portions are undersized. Not a good value..."}
{"text":"They change their Tuesday half off chicken wing promotion.  now you get dressing and carrots, Etc. For no extra charge. It's about time they stop being greedy"}
{"text":"Wings were on point, we ordered our order to go...when we got there we weren't even greeted.  Took us 5-10 minutes to be acknowledged."}
{"text":"My boys and I love coming here. My son is special needs and all the girls fuss over him and he loves it. Great service. Good food."}
{"text":"Management here SUCKS! They would take a to-go order by phone claiming they're too busy. Taking a look around they're not busy at all."}
{"text":"There are times when you want wings, and when you do, Buffalo Wild Wings come to the rescue.  Especially if you make it on a Tuesday night (for wings) or Thursday night (for boneless wings).  You can of course get them on other nights, but those are the nights when you get decent prices - $0.45 wings and $0.60 boneless last I checked.  Of course, I'm getting old, and I remember when you could get $0.10 wings on certain nights - not here, mind you - but you didn't get a monstrous choice of wing sauce.  Is it worth it?  That's for you to decide.  The service is good, and the wings themselves are wings - pretty tough to mess up wings, after all.  The sauce pretty well masks the wings themselves, and the sauces aren't bad, but there isn't anything outstanding.  Our oldest loves the place.  He'd put us even more in the poor house if we lived closer.  Your best bet is probably to come here for something like a sporting event, as you aren't likely to be able to hold much of a conversation, since the large interior makes it a bit noisy.  That's not bad, just means you aren't going to have a romantic evening.  You knew that already, right?  Sweet Tea Report: Not too sweet, but not too shabby.  Refills generally seem to come in spurts - sometimes it is filled quickly, other times not at all.  I'd put it about in the middle of the road."}
{"text":"I've been to Buffalo Wild Wings a few times, but not for a while.  The last time, in fact, happened to be on the night of a fight (or some other sporting event I don't keep up with), only to be met at the door with a huge line, finding out that I didn't want to deal with that crowd.  This time, we found an almost empty interior, which is nice.  Maybe the recession is finally hitting all these restaurants, because lots of them are empty on the inside, which is nice from a service standpoint.  We had extremely personal service from the waitress, meaning regular refills and checking up to see how things were going.  I can't imagine that on a regular basis.  I like this location much better than the one in the university area.  It's more open, which means that noise travels further, but it doesn't have that cave feel.  The one in Kannapolis (Concord?) is similar to this one, but that's way out of the way.  Anyway, I'm a fan of wings in general, but I don't always like hot wings, and this is where Buffalo Wild Wings comes in.  They have a ton of flavors, though I don't like all of them.  Some are a bit to much glop for my taste.  Just a touch works well.  Though actually on this go-round I tried their new slider menu, and because they were slow, they fixed up a trio of different sliders - much like when we were at Lebowski's a while back.  Very nice of them.  They don't advertise this option, but if you ask nicely, they will probably do it for you.  Then I had some wings later.  All-in-all a good visit."}
{"text":"I've been to a sports bar or two in my time, and this one really blows.  Or maybe we just had really bad seats.  I don't know exactly what it is, but it's just about impossible to enjoy the game(s) that are going on.  When I want to catch some games, I'd like to be able to take them in.  I totally get that you're going to get cross-talk from different games, and that's okay - but at this location, it's so bad that you can't hear anything.  Some of the best places I've seen will give you a speaker on your table where you can tune in the game you want to hear.  Or if there's a game that's really big, they turn that one on.  At BW3, they just turn them all on full-blast (or so it seems), and you can't hear anything - or perhaps you hear everything.  The food is good, and you get a choice of all sorts of sauces on your wings (which makes it difficult - how do you choose which one?).  The service is pretty good too.  But you can get wings anywhere, so it's nothing particularly special.  You really have to want to sit through the cacophony in order to eat them, though."}
{"text":"Get It Together!!! I've been here about five times and never get good service and the place smells bad (like dirty mop water). Our last meal (for four) was only about $8 because the manager had to take a bunch of stuff off because it was all served cold. I only go back because I really love some of the BWW sauces. I am bummed THIS is the B'dubs that is near my house.  Corporate needs to fix this place. NOW! Please."}
{"text":"The experience I had at this location was beyond terrible. It started off okay with a bubbly waitress, Kayla, who may possibly be new.But as soon as we felt her uneasiness about our order's correction, we were unsure of how the rest of the night would be. Once our food was being sent out we realized the errors made. The waitress put in two items incorrectly. We understood the mistake was minor, other than being over charged for both. But what was very upsetting was to wait around for seemingly long amounts of time before having any help. After getting our check, we noticed the errors and pointed them out to the waitress. It took about 10 minutes for her to find help to fix the error. Once she fixed the error we waited 25 minutes for her to finally take our card and go to complete the transaction. Sadly the night was not very busy. And although Kayla may have been new, the management and other staff was not very attentive."}
{"text":"okay, we've been going to this restaurant since like 2 years ago. Me and some friends have this tuesday tradition going there. They've been great, but ever since they renovated it and added a whole new crew of staff, they've been slackin off with the service. youd think since were a regular they'd treat us better. so yesterday when me and my boyfriend went there for the tuesday special, i mean they got us seated right away even though they were super busy. FOOD WAS SUPER GREAT, like always (: but then the girl only checked on us once, and she was really late with giving us refills with the drinks. After we ate our meal, we tried getting the check, and it took us 4 times to call her and get it for us !! she passed by us like 3 times and i saw her look at us and YET she still didnt come up to the table. until i finally yelled out EXCUSE ME then she turned around and came up to the table. tsk tsk. OVERALL though, the food was amazing. service ? eh, it was okay"}
{"text":"The waiter was extremely nice, even though he was clearly stressing with the amount of tables that flooded in within twenty minutes. Good experience here!"}
{"text":"McDonald's is better at cooking chicken spent over an hour trying to leave ... never again"}
{"text":"Service was awful, long wait times and we didnt receive our drinks for almost 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"Had a good time here for dinner last night. Good wings (sauces!) and beer (Newcastle on tap!). The staff was very attentive and courteous. The entire experience maintained my good feelings about B-dub dub. I would have gone again tonight except I wanted to try a new spot (Majerle's) I will come back to this location as it was a very enjoyable experience. Hope you have a chance to try it out and you have as good of a time as I did."}
{"text":"This place is just like every other bdubs. Walked in with 3 and said we would probably have a party of 7. We had to wait 15 minutes and yet a party of 4 waiting on 3 got seated immediately. Granted the restaurant was not busy at all but the manager complained about not having the seating for us. Don't waste your time with this place. Absolute garbage."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour on a windy Thursday. I couldn't really tell if the place was packed because we headed right for the bar. I don't usually come for the boneless wings; I'm a traditional wings typa girl. Butttt who can resist 70 cent wings, amirite?   If you want more than one flavor for your wings, you have to order at least 4 of one flavor. I got 4 of the Asian zing & 4 lemon pepper. I also ordered fried pickles, celery, and ranch. My friend ordered 4 wings of something, onion rings, and the garlic mushrooms. In my opinion, I think boneless wings are too breaded. It's so heavy compared to traditional wings. They were just okay to me. The fried pickles were also very heavy on the breading. The onion rings & garlic mushrooms were perfect though! Really went well with the sauce.   The service was alright. The girl never really came around to ask if we were okay. She gave us another glass of water at the very end... lol we couldn't wave down anyone to come give us refills while we were eating. Anyway, it's just a regular bdubs, nothing special. Will be back on tuesdays tho!"}
{"text":"Don't do it, don't think about it, KEEP DRIVING to a different location.  The service sucks!  I mean we literally had to yell the waitress' name to get her to come back to the table each and EVERY time.  She spilled our drinks everywhere.  One of the servers stood in the doorway of the patio and had a phone conversation.  That means in the middle of the cleveland winter she held the door to the dinning room open while guests REPEATEDLY told her it was cold so she could continue to have her conversation.  On this particular Saturday, nobody cared about their job as the food was as horrible as the service.  I don't know why this place is still open and had I looked at the reviews before stopping with friends, we would have kept going.  On that same tangent, the horrible reviews about this place are very accurate and not a thing of the past.  If you read this and still decide to waste your time here then you are a glutton for punishment and didn't see the Fairmont martini bar across the street.  Melt is also up the street if you want to keep with the casual vibe.  Simply, any place but here is the correct answer when deciding on food in this area."}
{"text":"Pros: Relatively Easy access. Open 24x7. Close by to a Chinese Place and Subway if someone in your group doesn't want BWW but wants take-out.   Cons: Service. If Makayla is working for carryout you get what you ordered. If not, all bets are off and service can be surly and most often sucks. I prefer to get carryout from here because the recent \"remodel\" didn't make the place much better. The TV's still suck, the service is usually bad, and the food quality can be hit or miss too.   In short when someone asks me to go here I whine and groan. Surely out of all the places in Vegas to get food from they could find something else besides this?   2 Stars is all I can give and that's being generous."}
{"text":"Do NOT go to this restaurant. Repeat, do NOT go to this restaurant. If you do, at least you've been warned.   I don't believe I have ever given a \"bad\" review of a restaurant before; typically I can find *something* positive to say, but in all honesty, if I could give this place negative stars, I would.   My fiancé and I came in here on a Sunday night simply because it was close to our hotel -- and I wish we hadn't. Only wanting a snack, we ordered French fries and a small order of chicken wings. The wings were far from fresh and the fries were practically inedible - cold and incredibly greasy. Our poor waiter tried his best when it came to service, but the restaurant and kitchen were completely mismanaged and he was obviously overworked/restaurant under-staffed. We moved from the restaurant to the patio, due to the noise level, and while there was NO ONE ELSE on the patio, during the entire duration of our stay, the tables from the previous parties were never bussed or cleaned. And at one point, we ordered extra wing sauce, and it took more than 15 minutes - for one ramekin of sauce -- to arrive at our table.   Dirty, noisy, understaffed, mismanaged, slow, + cold, non-fresh, substandard food. Horrible experience all around. Don't bother. Drive a little farther and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not going back! Walked up to the bar and the 2 fat chicks behind the bar are talking shit about co-workers and dumb shit. The food was subpar and the beers here are way too over priced. I mean really $6.50 for a Sam Adams octoberfest...WTF? If you want a good b- dubs, don't waste time here, go to the one over on McDowell. The service is better and the beers isn't as expensive. Oh yeah, never hear the staff at the McDowell establishment talk shit about each other. Lol"}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes and no one no one came to check on me. When I've gone in the past the food has been good, but I'm not going to wait 15 or more minutes before someone comes to take my order."}
{"text":"I've always thought the location was weird but it has plenty of its own parking away from the Home Depot. We came here for an early dinner after shopping and to our surprise they were having a special on boneless wings. I ordered the medium and they were pretty hot but a good hot. My husband got the Buffalo and he said they were good. We absolutely love their deep fried pickle chips which was our main reason for choosing to eat here today. We did have to wait for a minute to be greeted and seated but after that our waitress was great. They also give tablets for the kids to play games at the table which was really nice for our 5 year old while waiting on our food."}
{"text":"I can't say it was the worst restaurant experience I've had but it was pretty disappointing for Buffalo Wild Wings. Waiter came around pretty quick and took our order. He delivered our order and went about his business. I came across an uncooked wing and ran out of my drink. We didn't get our celery and carrots to snack on. We decided we'd wait for our waiter to check up on us to tell him. He never came around even though he flew by us at least three times; didn't bother to attend to use. He eventually came around after we were done and asked if we needed to go boxes. Yeah, good one bro. So we asked for the to-go boxes and asked for a coke to go since I didnt enjoy a refill. He came back with the boxes and we asked him for lids for the sauces to take. He couldn't have given us a more obvious sign that he was annoyed and bothered. But he brought them. My total came out to $40.02. So I paid $40.02."}
{"text":"WORST BWW we have ever visited. We walked in to catch the 2nd half of the Houston-Golden State Game 7 and no one was at the hostess table. A kid finally popped his head out of a side door and asked if we were carry out or dining in. We said dining in and he disappeared again. So we continued walking into the restaurant and it was full with the exception of a 4-top that was disgusting and needed to be bussed. The other two vacant seats were at the bar, and also had dirty dishes, glasses and napkins, along with sauce smeared on the table. No one that worked there seem to even acknowledge us so we sat at the bar and cleaned it ourselves with dry napkins we reached over the bar to retrieve. I watched several wait staff walk by the other table and look at it...not bothering to bus it. Then a group of diners got loud and the guys  were standing up yelling at each other. Everyone in the restaurant had taken notice, as did the bartender and wait staff and NO ONE that worked there asked them to leave. I watched a dad & son get up and walk out because it made them so uncomfortable. Bartender did not refill our water, or even ask. I should note, they were also out of the only IPA offered on their menu and the bartender matter-of-factly told me they don't have it and offered no explanation. They got our wing order wrong to top it all off. And their mango habanero both were the hottest my husband and I ever ate. I thought I was having an allergic reaction for a moment, and we eat that flavor all the time! They must not mix the sauce/spices properly, but it made for a very unpleasant meal. This was the most disappointing BWW trip we've ever experienced. We will NEVER visit this location again. Get a manager that can properly run that place! Dirty, unprofessional atmosphere, and slow service. No one that worked there acted like they wanted to be there or serve anyone in their restaurant. Horrible atmosphere it has created."}
{"text":"Great wings and great service by Daniel! !! Love my blue moon on draft! Try the havanero mango mmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas celebrating my birthday and during one of the days we were walking down the strip and I got really hungry so I just came to the nearest spot which is here. I always loved Buffalo Wild Wings, which I call \"B-Dubs.\" The guy serving us was so nice and right away he noticed from checking my ID that it was my belated birthday before I even pull out my birthday coupon. With my coupon, the meal came out to be about $25, which is not bad considering we also ordered alcoholic drinks. The level of spiciness of the wings was just right. Definitely a place worth coming to if you're on the strip and didn't want to spend big bucks eating in the casinos. You can't go wrong with wings and drinks."}
{"text":"I'm not going to say we had a really bad experience, wings were a little rubbery. Manager came over and fixed it. The kudos I want to send out is to our waitress Brittany that was understand, supportive. Customer service was beyond. Will we go back, of course"}
{"text":"I asked for the wings to be extra crispy and extra wet, they were neither. i had to go home and add extra bbq sauce amd try to crisp them up! So disappointing, needless to say we will not frequent them for awhile. They are not worth it, especially since they upped the price and lowered the amount of wings!"}
{"text":"Any Buffalo Wild Wing joint is my first choice by far. When my husband and I head back to Las Vegas this is the first stop we make before headed home. I'm so happy they opened one South of the Strip. Beats Wing Stop by FAR! Sorry :) What I recommend: Parmesan Garlic, Asian Zing, and Carribean Jerk flavors... Don't forget your basket of wedges and stuffed mushrooms to go along with your tall glass of FAT TIRE."}
{"text":"Went to see my Steelers play the Bengals 1/9/16. The server we had was pretty attentive but couldn't help noticing the other waiters and waitresses joking and laughing in the corner and checking their phones. My food came out wrong but the waiter took it back and made it right with no problem he also checked on us regularly. When we were leaving I stopped at the front desk to get a bag for my left overs and THREE staff walked past me, made eye contact and did not say a word. One young waitress who was carrying a tray full of dirty dishes stopped and asked did I need help and put the tray down to give me a bag and waited on the customers behind me. Thumbs up to her?. Probably will not go back, this restaurant needs better management."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here last night with wifey to watch the Charlotte Hornets lose to the Miami Heat. The food IMO is just mediocre and service is OK sometimes. I would not have chose to come here but my wife and son wanted to come here. I must admit I have a slight grudge against this location for an incident that happened awhile back. My daughter came here to eat with friends and received very poor service from whoever was waiting on them and she decided not to leave a tip. Come to find out when she got her bank statement the waitress added herself a 5.00 tip for a 12 to 13.00 bill. The tip amount was not the problem but adding the tip herself definitely is, that is theft. I called the restaurant to express my concern about the incident and they just tried to brush it off in a way that gave me the impression this happens often. I emailed and called the corporate office, this is when they heard me. THAT IS THEFT!!"}
{"text":"I know I shouldn't like this place, but I really do. I've been visiting this location since I was in high school! Geesh, long time, and I've gone through phases. I used to love it, then I couldn't go anymore because of health reasons, then I finally went back in moderation and now I love it again.  There are a lot of dishes that could use makeovers, but I'm not here for fine dining, so I order a few select items and I stick to them. I almost always order wings (or \"boneless\" when I'm feeling lazy or don't want to get messy) and potato wedges with Cajun seasoning! Delicious, delicious, delicious. Actually, I only order one sauce now: Chipotle BBQ (well, it's a dry seasoning, but even better because I love seasonings more than sauces). When I'm in a saucy mood, I go for Hot BBQ or Honey BBQ. I've had most of the other sauces and seasonings and they're all good. The potato wedges are just soo good. The chive and onion seasoning and flavorful, crispy exterior creates delicious potatoes. They used to have the Cajun option on the menu, but have removed it for a few years, so just ask for it and they know. And trust me, the Cajun MAKES it the best fries (well, behind duck confit fries..and well, yeah you get the picture; it's not the very best, but it's darn good). Oh, and don't forget the vegetable boat and ranch dressing. Yum.  I'm sure everyone knows about Wing Tuesdays and Boneless Wing Thursdays (and late night happy hour as well?). My brother and I calculated it before and it's only worthwhile when you order a certain amount of wings and if you don't want the veggie boat or dressing/dip (since these are extra on those orders). I like those things, so the wing specials don't matter to me as much.  I've had my share of appetizers and other entrees and for the most part, they're tasty, but not amazing. I do not like their nachos, so I would avoid those if I were you. Also, not very Vegetarian-friendly here; even all their salads have meat, but I'm sure you can order them without the animals.  Oh, and they're open 24 hours. Can't complain!  EDIT (02/26/2013): Now you have the choice of traditional or boneless on Tuesdays and Thursdays don't have a special anymore. Also, I just noticed that they have a black bean burger as a protein option on their menu!! How exciting! And I almost swore them off for Vegetarian eats! I'll need to try that next time I'm here."}
{"text":"I like BWW and my experiences have been mostly consistent at all valley locations I've visited so far. No complaints and nothing comes to mind of anything negative to say!  I have been to this particular location just three times. The last two times were based on the fact that this is the closest location to my parents' house and this was the best location to meet friends that live further north.   What's there to hate anyway? Mostly decent food, 24-hour dining, more TVs than I can count, sports sports sports, and quick service. I go to BWW when I have a hankering for chicken wings (or to watch a game and hang out with friends). But that's pretty much it. Their food is not very spectacular and honestly, without their chicken wings (or those delicious potato wedges), the place would easily be 2-3 stars. So stick to the wings..and potato wedges. Not the fries or chips. Trust me.  My go-to menu items are boneless chicken wings tossed with their dry seasoning, Chipotle BBQ. It's so good. I prefer dry seasoning over sauces, so I was ecstatic when they introduced the seasonings. Along with the chicken, a basket of potato wedges with Cajun seasoning. It's amazing. With their ranch and veggie boat, I'm a happy gal. Sometimes we will order one of the appetizers, but nothing is phenomenal. On my last visit, I tried their new Garden Crasher. A platter of various raw vegetables (carrots, celery, bell pepper, cucumber) with hummus and yogurt. The hummus was not very good, but to get a platter full of fresh vegetables in a bar restaurant? I was very happy."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible management. Ordered boneless wings and they barely had sauce on them. Took forever to get our food. Bathroom only has one toilet. Most importantly, this is supposed to be THE place to watch nfl football and they only had one game on and took forever to change the games. And half the TVs had a blank screen on them. The management has absolutely no idea how to run the TVs."}
{"text":"Great fun place to eat and watch the games, great customer service.."}
{"text":"I like this B-DUBS....as everyone seems to call it.    The service was great, the hostess and waitress were friendly and prompt.....and it was even a game night when we went!    The food was good (caribbean jerk boneless wings) and the beer was ICE COLD (Corona, if you were wondering).  I would definately go back.  And, for Scottsdale, it was reasonably priced.  Rock on B-DUB A DUBZ!"}
{"text":"Worst b dubs in the history of b dubs.  1. We were greeted by a less than happy bartender almost as if we were inconveniencing him Because he couldn't stay on his phone and had to come greet us.    2. Food came out fast, a little to fast. Our boneless wings were older than me and had to be sent back.   3. The worst part of all the bathroom. One word FOUL. Smelled like a sewer ate a fart and then farted. Literally worse than a state fair Porta-potty. There was toilet paper all over the place and, feces covered baby wipes all over.   It was absolutely the worst experience I have ever had at a Buffalo Wild Wings and I can guarantee I will NEVER RETURN. Heed my warning and avoid this place. If the bathroom was that bad and they don't care enough to clean it, god only knows what the kitchen looks like. I would put money on the bet they don't even wear gloves.  Steer clear."}
{"text":"Cool place, redecorated interior. Bar staff is usually pretty attentive and very kind. Waitresses are usually slow so sit at the bar if you can."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for the first time in probably over a year. One thing I can't stand about BWW is that they use paper tray's for their wings and fries, which is unsustainable, but I won't start on that tangent :)  I'm not a huge wing person, so I decided on the buffalo chicken sandwich. It came out quickly enough, and besides their not being sauce on the whole sandwich (just a little drizzle down the middle), it was pretty good. Our server was attentive and nice, and as we were in a crunch for time, we were in and out in no time."}
{"text":"A group of coworkers and I came here before the spring training game last Friday and since I am not a huge fan of BWW, I had already decided that I'd be getting wings and fries. I was surprised that there wasn't a ton of people when we arrived around 5 and we had a big table out on the patio. We had I think 3 servers working on our group which I think added to the chaos of the evening. Meals came out out of order, I received my fries about 10 minutes after my wings, we had to wait about 15 minutes for someone to come out to order another round of drinks, etc etc. Don't get me wrong, the servers were all nice and apologetic, but something seemed off during our visit. A couple of folks in my party complained about the food quality, but what I had was good. As I left I overheard the manager telling another table that they were overwhelmed with the spring training crowd, but considering that games have been going on for a few weeks, it seemed a little surprising that they were still experiencing kinks.   Can't say if and when I'll be back."}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner with two of my friends. It was my first time and wasn't really sure what to expect.   Well, the place was really clean and although it was pretty packed, we were seated immediately in the dining area. Our server asked if everyone had been there before and I chimed in so he gave me the run down with all the sauces and wings and stuff. We get our drinks and place our orders. I got 12 traditional wings with hot bbq and honey bbq sauces and some fries. My friends got wings + fries and the buffalo chicken wrap. Our server mentioned that 4 cooks didn't come in today so that there would be a bit of a wait. So about 15 minutes later...our food arrives. So riddle me this BWW...Why are there no plates? I can imagine they're conserving quite a bit of water, but if you bring out 6 containers for my meal alone, that just seems like a huge waste of cardboard. That really bothered me the whole time I was there. Anyways, the food was pretty good. I feel like I could get better wings at a number of different places. If I was big into sports though, this would be a great place to hang out during happy hour or something."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night around 7pm and it was packed but was sat down immediately. Service was good even though the food took awhile to come out. The wings were decent in my opinion and better than Hooters (my boyfriend would say hooters hands down). Nothing fancy. Good spot to watch sports."}
{"text":"So I'm worried I might get salmonella. That chicken raw though. Other then the raw chicken. I enjoy the place. Nice place to hang out. Service isn't too bad. Forgot a few orders (carrots ranch)"}
{"text":"Alright so for a chain hot wing restaurant I don't expect much more... they offer a large of variety of wing sauce flavors and temperatures. Which I think is pretty darn good! The chicken is what you can expect from any large restaurant chain. It's a fun place to go with a group of friends order a bunch of beer and wings, what more do you want. The beer selection and service is typically not all that bad either, when in need of hot wings and I nothing else that is local or regional comes highly recommended I will typically default to the Buffalo Wild Wings! Try the Blazin' Challenge if you dare...the staff is so much fun and all I can say is \"Oh you think you fancy!\""}
{"text":"Ive been coming to this location atleast twice a month for 4 years and i cant believe they dont have a 5 star review on yelp. Ive never been dissapointed at all. Food is always great, staff is friendly and proffessional. I could not be happier with the service. The establishment always meets my standards for cleanliness as well. Good Job crew!!!"}
{"text":"The wings suck. I love good wings and these just aren't. Service was mediocre at best. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Always consistent great food, service and drinks!   Always a fan of this place, it's a little noisy but also a sports place so understandable!   5/5"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on a quiet day. I must say,  being that I wasn't expecting much,  I was very impressed. The wings were good,  the atmosphere was nice,  and the staff was friendly.  I tried the shrimp and ribs for my entree,  and while not *spectacular*,  they were still actually pretty good!  Pleasantly surprised by this place,  sums it up.  Definately would reccommend."}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with sports and booze! Aside from having the best hot wings in town and amazing appetizers, the batenders also rock! Customer service couldnt have been better. Want to have a great laugh and cold beer after work? Ask for Chris!!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. This is hands down the worst branch of this restaurant I've ever been to. During my visit a few months ago I was the only patron in the entire bar. It was after work and roughly 2am, the bartender forgot my drink order twice and forgot that I even ordered food. Then once he remembered that I ordered food, it was wrong! He brought me the wrong beer too!  So I decided to try takeout today since the service is obviously sub-par. The food came out in a decent timely manner, they gave me bone-in wings when I instead ordered boneless. I was hungry so I said I didn't mind and then went home. As I got ready to eat, I opened the lid and saw fucking feathers still attached to the chicken. I almost threw up.  I called the manager to complain and he casually responded with \"well yea, it's chicken.. that's gonna happen sometimes\". Are you kidding me? Is there any sort of quality control whatsoever for your kitchen? They cooked it, sauced it, put it in a box to serve and still didn't see an issue with it? It's 100% obvious to me that nobody here gives a flying shit about the quality of food they serve to their customers. Thankfully he gave zero resistance to a full refund and responded with \"yea aight man I'll get it taken care of for you\". Aight? Man? How about 'ok sir'? The unprofessionalism is astounding.   I will never return to this location. I've been to many others (including the original in Kent, Ohio) and this is the worst."}
{"text":"Excellent experience!  Stephenie was awesome ! I came n for a beer n togo food ..she got me in and out with such a great attitude. ..that's wat customer service is all about..I'll definitely be back on a wed to c stephanie:)"}
{"text":"My husband and I use to come often and we always hang out and spend good money. We even had 2 regular servers that we were close with. Last time we went in about a month or so ago the food was not the best. Went back today wasn't busy. Sat in the bar at a table 3 servers plus manager sat in the kitchen entrance and talked and one server walked past us twice just clapping her hands and smiling at us. Sat for another few minutes and left..."}
{"text":"Good bartender Terrible food Maybe I'll learn to give up on this chain Wings are never done and nasty Fries with cheese and bacon is a congealed inedible pile of garbage Seriously  Go elsewhere, this place is terrible"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly bartenders and wait staff  and $3.25 20 oz Michelob Ultras for anyone running and training for races in the area!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is one of the few big chain restaurants I frequent, though to be fair, I really only go here for half priced wing Tuesdays and for happy hour.  For a few years I stopped going to Buffalo Wild Wings because it seemed like they were trying to find the smallest wings they could to serve you. About a year ago I went back and was pleasantly surprised to see decent sized wings again. And a giant plus that they stopped charging for ranch, bleu cheese, celery and carrots.  The main reason to come here is, of course, wings. They have about twenty different sauces to choose from, and most of them are pretty good. I personally love the Thai curry and garlic parmesan, but I also like the normal flavors (hot, medium) and spicy garlic. An order of 20 wings will set you back about $20 (unless its Tuesday) and they let you get them in batches of five, so I recommend trying a few different flavors.  The have some very good happy hour specials, and their normal menu food is pretty good to. I don't think I have ever had a sandwich or burger here, but I have had lots of appetizers and we love the chicken tacos (they are on special during happy hour). They have amazing fried cheese curds, and the fries can be dusted with different seasonings.  This place is a great place to watch sports to, as they have TVs everywhere. One downside is they get crowded a lot, but we usually don't have to wait long. If your a larger group, and you go on Tuesday or on a big sports night, you might not be so lucky.  They have a decent beer selection with some craft on draft, unfortunately none of it is local though. The servers, while always kind, never seem to be able to answer questions about the beers and have to ask the bartenders for prices and information. I've also found they have a hard time keeping their draft menu up to date. A note on the servers, while I have never had bad service here their staff always seems rushed and it can often be a pain to get someone. Reading over some of the other recent reviews I see almost all the low scores are for bad customer service, so they may have a problem in this area I just haven't experienced yet.  Buffalo Wild Wings also started an app where you earn points with every purchase. I recommend getting it if you are going to be here regularly, as you can redeem the points for free food. I have only had three meals on the app and already have enough points for a meal or a few smaller choices.  My biggest gripe with this place is that the prices seem a little high (especially on the wings) outside of their specials. I don't know why anyone would pay a dollar a wing here when on Tuesday they are .50 cents.  In summary, come here for good wings and good appetizers, and try to do it on Tuesdays or Happy hour to save yourself some money."}
{"text":"I ordered online and went to this location to pick up my order. The whole staff was waiting on one staff member who was taking a complicated online order. They could not check out anyone waiting in line for their pick up orders until he got off the terminal. However, he was on there a good ten minutes before any of us could be helped. It seems like there should be a better system for this.   The food was very hot and fresh but not the best thing I've ever had. It's good ton note they have great deals on traditional wings on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"The worst meal we have had all year. Overcooked wings. Over cooked burger. Slow service."}
{"text":"Oh how the once mighty have fallen...  Buff-Wild as I call them, used to be my go-to late night boneless wings venue since 2008.  The tasty flavors I loved like honey bbq, Asian Zing, and teriyaki, sided with favorite like pickle chips, mozzarella sticks, or garlic mushrooms, and washing it all down with a cold refreshing Diet Pepsi.  My bartender/server Brian always kept me in good sprits even when I was down always refilling my glass and stopping by to shoot the sh** whenever he was free to do so.  But over the last year, the service, the quality of food, and the pricing have all gone waaaayyyyy downhill.  Charging for condiments shouldn't be a \"thing\".  Ranch and bleu cheese shouldn't be priced if they compliment the meal.  It's like putting a price tag on the ketchup bottle at the table and charging $.25 a drop.  It's ridiculous.  The service at the bar has changed their staff so much now that they all appear to be tired college students that look just absolutely miserable and hardly even give you any kind of 2nd glance if you need something.  Recently I went there and asked my server for ranch dressing since she forgot it.  I asked her a 2nd time...  I asked her a 3rd time...  I eventually finished the meal without the ranch and when I got my receipt, I found there was a charge for ranch!  WTF?!  But, the be all end all of this was last night.  I thought I'd give it one more shot after having not visited the place in almost 5 months.  I walked in after driving for Uber around 3:00 AM.  The bar was empty and one guy was tending.  I asked for the garlic mushrooms and a snack size portion of boneless wings flavored honey bbq and Asian Zing.  The chicken was AWFUL!  It used to be nice and chewy and not so crispy and hard!  It was honestly like chewing down on sharp tree bark that you hoped wouldn't cut and slice your mouth!  The only saving grace throughout the ordeal was the Diet Pepsi I had to wash it all down.  I love Diet Pepsi so there's really no way that anyone could screw that up, unless it's been too watered down or it's just overly carbonated.  But alas, nothing good can stay I guess and whoever is managing now should've taken some cues from the crew that was there running the place from 2008-2014.  I think the best time was when that young blonde woman with the glasses was managing.  I don't know who is managing now, but it's definitely in need of a shot in the arm.  Nice knowing you Buff-Wild...thanks for the good times."}
{"text":"We came on a week night and it was packed. We grabbed the only open table in the bar. We found out it was was Boneless Wing 55cent night. I ordered a wrap and my hubby ordered an appetizer sampler platter. It too FIFTY FIVE minutes to get our food. My order wasn't even correct. The only reason they are getting one star is because our server was extremely nice."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings, this was our first time trying. We had a coupon for a free snack wing, along with a gift card we had gotten awhile ago. Came for lunch, was greeted and seated right away, sat at a high table in the bar section. I did take a personal note that the place was very clean and all tables and chairs were being wiped down thoroughly with a cleaner. We couldn't of ask anything more from our server Katie K, very friendly very helpful in accommodating our coupons and gift card to lunch specials. Katie K was very attentive to serving and filling up waters and ice tea and checking to see if we needed anything meanwhile manning the bar too.  We ordered lunch specials of: 1 snack wing Buffalo Mild with a Caesar Salad side and 1 small wing 1/2 Mango Habanero and the other 1/2 wild with a Caesar Salad side. The wings were descent and the salad OK. We also received goodie cups with coupons and stuff. I would be back if in the area to use the coupons."}
{"text":"Pissed!!!! Got off work late wanted to eat and got refused service because my husband did not have his ID... The dumbest s*** I ever heard.  You mean to tell me I can't eat chicken because I don't have an ID????"}
{"text":"BEWARE OF HORRIBLE SERVICE & NICKEL AND DIMING!!  I went here after my daughter's graduation and as usual, the service was terrible and I was overcharged on my bill.  This might be the worst run BWW in the country.  We have never had good service and are consistently overcharged on our bill. In this specific instance, I had to TWICE go to the bar to get drink refills for my family.  Waiter was nowhere to be seen.  Then to top the horrible service off, when I received my check get this: My daughter ordered a kid's meal and I was charged for the adult version ($10 vs. $5) and then I saw that I was charged .60 cents SIX TIMES for sauce and also the carrots that came with my wings.  When was the last time you were charged for carrots with your wings?  I am done trying to make this toilet work for us.  Fire the manager and half the staff who just sit around talking while the customers have to fill their own drinks."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Service was super slow.  Very very slow..  I think they had to grow the food"}
{"text":"Just going to say it. Not a fan, I think the wings are fatty and they don't put enough sauce on them. The burger was over cooked and lacked flavor. I tried to find some positive but as for the food...nothing. It is nice to watch football and baseball but I would not spend your money on the food."}
{"text":"Wings wings wings and more wings....  Yum!  So many flavors, so little time.  I like this place,  there's so many different flavors and heat levels - you'll never get bored.  Lot's of beer too!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for 10 hours on opening day for years worth of wings.  They let us all in and the atmosphere was nice, service was great.  I got the spicy garlic boneless wings, this was my first time trying boneless wings and I can honestly say they were awful.  It taste like a Tyson chicken nugget with there sauce on them.  My friends got traditional wings and say they were great, so I would just stay away from boneless.  Also, the GM seemed like a total dick, not sure if he was just stressed or something, but to be in the people business, he better change!    All in all, a great place that's open late!"}
{"text":"Nate the bartender is so amazing. It was midnight and he was attending like 10 different people and getting all their drinks super fast and getting food to the table so quickly. All while also answering the door buzzer all the time and still checking up to make sure we had everything we needed and liked our drinks. He gave great service and was very attentive!!  Will come back just for him!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight it was crowded we were about to be seated and then was told that the table in the bar area they were going to give us was reserved. Decided to walk outside and call because reservations at a sports bar is questionable. As we thought, the employee that answered the phone said they do not accept reservations. Needless to say we did not eat there. We did go back inside to tell the mamager what happened and his response started with \"weellll....\". BWW needs to figure out their reservation policy or if they have one because it doesn't look good for business. Did they just not want \"us\" in the restaurant? Maybe our family/group aren't the type of people they want to attract. Why else would they tell us in person they are holding a table for a reservation coming in then tell us they don't take reservations when we call in from the parking lot???"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, I gave it another chance, but the food is just not good. The service is average, but the dishes that I have tried here were very bland and just something you can get from the frozen aisle at the grocery store. Not coming back, to any location."}
{"text":"Pretty standard BW3s.  The habanero mango wings were sweet and sticky with a decent heat level.  The buffalo chips were like an undercooked potato chip, but were fine as a filler.  Service was pretty good for how packed the place was for the bowl game."}
{"text":"If you've been to one Buffalo Wild WIngs you've been to them all, and this one was no different.  I tried to Queso Burger this time (I usually stick to wraps or their wings) and it was the messiest burger I have tried, good though.  This is a great place to catch your favorite team play.  Prices are average, Tuesdays and Thursdays are the best days to go.  Tuesdays are 50 Cent Wings I believe and Thursdays are 50 Cent Boneless Wings.  50 Cents or half off, either way its a cheap place for wings on the two lovely days of the week.  Wing Stop is still my favorite to go grab wings however (Lemon Pepper are the shiz-nit!).    We went about 6ish and parking was pretty hard to find."}
{"text":"Love the food but the management of the restaurant is absolutely terrible. Went to pick up my order and the only one doing any work is the poor girl at the cashier counter. She has to get the order , answer the phone , and ring it up all while 5 other employees sit on their phones and do nothing. 5 stars for the cashier and the food , negative stars for the text a holics."}
{"text":"Good service. Good wings. Their tap water was disgusting but didn't make or break my experience..."}
{"text":"Believe it or not the Patio on Monday Night Football on 9/16/13 was empty and they had Metal guards down over TVs. Why??! Shameful.   Inside is dated."}
{"text":"Great TV set up in all areas.   Huge covered patio has fans, misters and heaters and sun screens, as well as 11 TVs.  Nice!!  Wish they had more local beers, but they recently added 10 more taps (total of 30 now), which is great.  No HH Sat/Sun."}
{"text":"Sound system inside at bar is woefully inadequate - impossible to hear.  There are no speakers above the bar area - all are behind and very high in the ceiling.   The vertical fluorescent lights in the beer coolers are extremely annoying/distracting as they are visible from all bar seats."}
{"text":"3/17/2016 TV Sound still unhearable anywhere in the bar area. No sound-deadening material to stop the incredibly loud volume of conversation due to high ceilings. 3 TVs behind bar are smaller than new BWW and the TV on the right behind bar has a permanent black line on the screen.  The couple coming out while I was coming in said they had been ignored by servers and couldn't hear themselves talk anyway so were leaving.   So much potential."}
{"text":"Wifi doesn't work on patio!!!!  Could use MUCH bigger TVs on patio and there's room for several more.  Sound system SUCKS!! Can't hear at bar - speakers WAY too high/bad/misdirected.  25 taps but vast majority are big national beers.  Instead of the full-size Jack Daniel's NASCAR outfit in a frame to right of bar they should have more TVs. There are two TVs at 180 degree angles to bar that no one can watch."}
{"text":"Wi-fi 'down till tomorrow?!' How is that possible in this day and age  There are ginormous beer stains on both big screen behind bar making watching TV there less than ideal.  Further, the horrible speakers/sound means you can't hear anything while sitting at bar.  Bathroom was a mess.  Just one urinal for a bar that size.  And the drip system for the disinfectant was coming loose."}
{"text":"It's the World Series and manager decides to have the TV sound on a meaningless Sunday Night Football game!!!!????????? Shameful!"}
{"text":"Food has always been good.  Service not so much when bartender named Mike is working. Takes too long to come to your table and if u go to the bar to order he will yell at you.  So be careful.  Dont go near the bar to ask.. for anything."}
{"text":"Came in on a slow night and the football game was on extra loud even even though it appeared all of the families in our area were attempting to have discussions. The kitchen was kind of slow so I ordered a second batch of fries when the first one arrived. My drink did not come as I had ordered it but the server was quick to remedy the situation.  When did they stop grouping their orders of wings in 5s? That's just dumb."}
{"text":"Great food, very tasty. No complaint there. Service though was iffy. No refills on water or other drinks. Overall poor customer service but great food."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Wild Wings for a couple years and why I come back is the great and personal customer service from the staff. Mostly the bartenders. But know the rest of the service staff and they do a great job. But the recent addition of Dave the manager has been quite a buzz kill. The former managers used to more engaging with the regular players and make us feel welcomed. He seems to be an incredible unhappy person as I've never seen him smile and interact with guests positively. Such a different vibe when I come in."}
{"text":"If you're a chain restaurant, how can you not have consistency!?  To be honest, I think I've been to BWW almost once a week for the past few weeks.  Tuesdays are $0.45 bone in wings, and Thursdays are $0.60 boneless wings.  You go in, you tell them how many wings you want, and then you specify what sauce you want your wings to have.  Ranch costs extra.  The food is good bar food, but one day you may go and have your wings drenched in delicious sauce, while another day you could stop in and have dry spots on your wings.  Service is always just okay, what I'd expect from a bar.  Want wings?  Is it Tuesday/Thursday?  Then stop by!  I haven't been early enough, but I believe happy hour is from 5:00-7:00.  Open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Great specials on Tuesday $.60 bone in wings and $.60 boneless wings on Thursday.  Great flavors and varieties from the mild flavors to the extremely hot. You can buy all their sauces and take them to go. Must try the salt and vinegar fries. Great tang. The chopped salads and flat breads are a great healthy combination.  Bring the kids for the video games and if you're not a sports fun they have great trivia game."}
{"text":"came during happy hour and got some of the $4 shareables, personal favorite is the southwest loaded potato chips. beyond impressed as it tasted even better this time than the last.  service was really good, they refilled our drinks constantly and brought us boxes towards the end without us having to ask. the hostesses were really nice and friendly as well.  food, delicious!!favorite sauces are parmeasean garlic and spicy garlic, and my favorite dry run from there is the lemon pepper. definitely love going here each time."}
{"text":"We always have a problem with this location. Going last night was our last visit. We asked for a booth and they said we don't have any. However, a few seconds later two parties came and they were seated at the booth. I can understand about 1 having a reservation but two. The food runner was rude and ignorant. We only ordered 1 carrot and celery but she brought us 2. She just stared without saying a word and walked away. A few times before this visit, the waitress dropped soda all over my brothers back. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"2 stars for our server. But no stars for our cold food. I would have gone else where but I'm pregnant and craving so I waited patiently for my wings and fries. Everything was cold, as if my food had been sitting in the kitchen waiting to come and be devoured. Anyways, I like Buffalo Wild Wings and don't mind paying for overpriced stuff when it comes out hot! Won't be back, sorry!"}
{"text":"We always come here normally at mid night due to our shifts at the time and always great service. Today we decided on dinner at 7. We walked in greeted and went directly to the bar. As you walk up bar tops were a mess and bartender was on register not even trying to clean. Then as we sat down in the only clean area he goes to guests on the other side to chit chat not bothering to clean. Husband came back from restroom which was a mess as messy as bar area. As bartender came to help and start cleaning we decided on leaving from a messy area to a salty area. As much as I wanted BWW I was very disappointed to have to leave. Maybe it was a bad night. But sadly a messy one."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of sampling BWW's delicious cuisine before it officially opened. Here's how:  I was minding my own business, walking out of the Charlotte Ear Eyes Nose & Throat where I was shadowing an audiologist, and BOOM! I see a giant buffalo-man walking around Rivergate. I approach him, give him a high-five, and find out that the Buffalo Wild Wings down the way is going to open on Monday, but that they are offering FREE FOOD for people that dine in today for lunch.   Victory. I called up a buddy and we got into lunch-mode. We shared the fried roasted garlic mushrooms, which were delicious. I ordered twelve traditional wings, split between the asian zing and traditional buffalo sauces. I preferred the later, which was rich and buttery, while the asian zing was a bit too sweet for my palette. My buddy ordered the steak stack sandwich, which featured strips of steak topped on  with pepper jack cheese, onion rings, and spicy garlic BWW sauce. He devoured it.   The BEST part is most definitely the tab: $0.00! We left our server a generous tip, of course, but it was nonetheless an epic dining experience. Will definitely be back for opening day!"}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible customer service! My wife planned my birthday party and booked the secluded room with a manager weeks ago. We had over 40 people that RSVP'd. My wife called today to verify that all was set for some great times for tomorrow, when she called the manager on duty told her that the room was over booked and that they instead had a table for 20 ready and there was nothing they can do about it. Sorry the manager from before got it wrong....WHAT?!?!? Thanks for ruining plans guys! We will take our money elsewhere!!!! I AM DONE WITH BWW. We will be sure to let all our family and friends know of the quality of customer service this business exudes!"}
{"text":"Hello..... does anyone from BW3s management read these?? when I started coming to Buffalo Wild Wings 16 years ago the \"small\" was 12 wings, then a few years ago it went to 5 each flavor (10 wings) same price and then it slowly increased and now its down to 9 wings for a small and the prices keep increasing.    This is called price gouging!   Dont come here! For the cost of just average service and food you can go to a real restaurant where you get way better food and service for the same price!      I used to love going to BWW for the wings but now never again!"}
{"text":"What it love about BWW is that it's open 24 hours, with the kitchen also open all night. I really like their sauces, I suggest the \"wild\" and the \"parmesan garlic\". You can play video poker at their bar also. Good staff, good late night food"}
{"text":"Best customer service I've had ! Cliff was our server he was amazing and VERY attentive never let our drinks go empty got our food out fast and made jokes . The food was amazing . Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"Do NOT eat at this location.   My son is throwing up right now because of their food.  He and a bunch of his friends went last night after a school performance and they are ALL throwing up today because of food poisoning from this place.  There are so many great places to go in Las Vegas.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"Literally walked out after waiting 15 mins for a waiter/ess and we got nada! The bartenders kept looking over at my bf and I, yet no one came to our table. Thumbs down BWW... 3 bartenders and the manager and still no service."}
{"text":"Just left the Centennial BWW after waiting for 15 mins and getting no service! This BWW on the other hand is on point. Literally sat at the bar and within seconds was greeted by the bartender."}
{"text":"Was there last night with as a party of 4 . Like others found the service was slow . Normally this is not what i would  give a low rating on. But it seemed to be well staffed . So not sure why . Bottom line is the food was disgusting. Everything had the same  gross under tone.  Like a chalky not quiet a flavour . Little hot but not a spice . It was there from appetizer to main. Nachos were a joke. I never seen a place be so cheap with the toppings . Little bit of lettuce . Only had a drizzle of the cheese food sauce . No real cheese. Suppose to have chilli on them. But I was thankful they only put a table spoon in the whole shareable order .  I did not say a word to the other people at our table . Trying not to let my opinion spoil the night. But another person at our table was so disappoint in the flavour of the wings they were given . He started to ask for his money back. Most of all of our food was left on the table. . So many quality places to pick from.  Don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"Parmesan garlic wings were tasteless. Had to add salt and pepper once I got home. The medium wings were alright though. Two stars for the wings being fresh and hot, but more than likely won't be back"}
{"text":"Choosing to come to Buffalo Wild Wings during a final basketball game was a bad decision on our part. They were slammed busy and incredibly loud, I could barely talk to the person in front of me. But I realize this isn't always true, just on busy game days. ;)  Our server was attentive and got us plenty of extra ranch for our wings. My favorite flavor is the garlic Parmesan, they're creamy and very flavorful. The lemon pepper dry rub were just ok, nothing to brag about.   Overall a good experience, I would choose to come on a different day."}
{"text":"I don't know if they ran out of ingredients or was just unlucky, but my takeout order of wings had barely any seasoning on it. If I wanted dry tasteless wings, I can just buy raw wings at walmart and just stick them in the oven. I got lemon pepper and garlic parmesan and they both tasted the same."}
{"text":"Service is terrible, the waitress only checked on us once during the entire meal, and we waited 20min after we are done with the meal for her to come back, and she didn't even plan on coming back if we didn't wave at her."}
{"text":"BWW is still the go-to for wings. I love their selection of sauce - and I believe a saw a new one on the menu. This location is nice, somewhat quiet (compare to the rest of crazy Vegas). Service was good as usual and there were plenty of seating."}
{"text":"I and a group of co-workers decided to have some drinks and chicken after a long week.  We got there around 11:45p and left about 1:45a. We sat at the bar and our waiter was quite pleasant and very attentive.     I ordered small hot wings and potato wedges with a Blue Moon and 2 shots of fireball.   The chicken wings were nicely smothered by some hot sauce that had me tearing up and I loved it oh so very much.  That Blue Moon was served in a tall glass with an orange on the rim.  Very delicious!!!    This was my first time ever coming to a BMW and I can genuinely say that this won't be the last especially since this place is less than 5min away from my job.  I will be making lots of stops here after work.    The only reason why I gave it 4 stars was because there was a Lady who showed up at the bar with an infant.  The baby's cry lead me to believe that he was less than a month old.  Why on earth was this lady there at midnight at a place with loud music?!  She was there for about 45min!!  I think an employee must have told her to remove herself from the bar because she then sat at a table.  Anyway,  I don't know if businesses especially ones that have a bar can refuse service to dumb parents.  You can rest assured that every time I looked at that mother I gave her a dirty look and made sure I looked at her straight in the eye. Not to mention all the comments I and my co-workers made out loud.  Shame on you!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. First time here & they gave us cold food, then got an attitude because we told them the service is horrible & we want hot food. Smh never will i come to this restaurant out here or in any other state. You guys are shitty."}
{"text":"What can I say? It's a chain. You can't go in here expecting a gourmet meal. I've been here twice and have received mediocre wings. They were a little stingy with the sauce. What I do like is the trivia game they have on the tv.  At my last visit we had a few cocktails and were playing trivia...all of a sudden all of our boards blanked out. One patron asked the bartender to reset the system (he had this happen at another facility).. The bartender got an attitude and claimed he couldn't do anything about it. After asking again, he went to a manager to find that the system could indeed be reset. The bartenders are very chatty and slightly slow to serve. I do like that the facility is non smoking...a rarity in Vegas! I will say the ladies bathroom is really dirty. It makes me wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen.. The bathroom could use a deep cleaning including having the grout cleaned. An obvious clue - when the grout on the floor is black and on the wall is a hundred shades lighter! Make sure to potty before coming here! I'll be back - main reason being for trivia...not for the food or service!"}
{"text":"Upon walking in to the Buffalo Wild Wings I was told we have reservations, no problem. I sit down at a booth. About 5 minutes in the manager asked us to sit with our group. I tell her, can I please have the Booth I have back problems. The chairs don't help. After that we move to our seats. To which I tell the server. Can I have my booth back. And I explain further.  She tells me to hold on, So I wait and wait. No response. I tell a different server. She goes to her manger and explains everything while I watch and read the managers lips. \"Oh they just make it up\" I won't be coming back to this location. I hope they are satisfied."}
{"text":"Would you like you know how my food was? Yeah...so would I. After calling in my order of 12 wings I was told that it would be ready in 20 min. Restaurants can be unpredictable, I get it but when I come in to pick up the order 25 minutes later and wait for other 40 minutes and all but one employee avoids eye contact with you and treats you like a hassle I lose my patience. I ask to cancel my order and this is the first time the manager makes an appearance. He didn't apologize, didn't try to save the sale, or even try to make things right. He refunded our card and said the money will go back on the card that was paid with, handed me the receipt and that was it. HORRIBLE customer service."}
{"text":"I used to love BWW and would come watch games. As far as the bar is concerned, no complaints.   Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because last two times I ate here I got really sick and never went back again. (Yes I went back the first time because I thought nothing of it.) After the second time, I had the same exact feeling and I knew it was the wings."}
{"text":"Came on Tuesday for their 60 cent per wing deal. They advertised that and they delivered. The food was good and the service good enough. If you wanna come here, I would say come on a Tuesday if you want wings with bones inside and Thursday if you want boneless wings.   Overall, a solid 4 stars because I received what was to be expected. Nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Service was the WORST!! Our waitress showed up once and apparently had better things to do. WE WILL NEVER BE BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this BWW quite a bit. It's close to the high school I went to, so friends and I were always there. Every Thursday my friend and I used to go there to eat. We would order the wings we like to eat, then order a new flavor sauce. The only sauces we haven't tried are Thai Curry, Jammin Jalapeno and Spicy Garlic. Can't go wrong with sweet BBQ or teryaki. If you want a little kick and some sweet, order Asian Zing. If you want a big kick and sweet, order Mango Habanero. I like hot food, so I tried Blazin. My lips were sure blazin all right! But they were really good. I don't like paying .50 for ranch. I've been tempted to bring my own because I use so much.  As far as service and cleanliness goes, they are always very attentive and the place is always clean. There was only 1 time when I wasn't too pleased with the service, but the waitress was new. Other than that, they have been cool. My friend usually picks songs from the jukebox and we sit there, eat and sing. Occasionally we will play the game that's on the screen or attempt to watch and understand the games on television. Game nights the place is packed. Get there early if you want a seat."}
{"text":"After this visit I remember why I stopped going to Buffalo Wild Wings. The place was clean, the games were on tv, the service was okay, but the food.....spend your money somewhere else! You get more breading than chicken, the wing sizes are terrible and it's just not good period. Also, my husband ordered a Moscow mule, he got a nasty drink in a glass tea cup. WTF. Not impressed and never going back."}
{"text":"Food is way overpriced for what it is and at this particular location the employees tend to be rude and argumentative. Service is extremely slow as well and it can be hard to get the attention of your waiter when you need something.   This location has some pretty negative feedback and the restaurant would do well to learn from these reviews and try to correct them.  ** Also, if you scroll to the very bottom on the review page you will see a number of \"unrecommended reviews\" of which most are really negative. None are rude or what I would consider worthy of being unrecommended so why are they not there with all the other reviews? I heavily rely on reviews to help me make my decisions as to where to take my business and want to be able to read all reviews - both the good and bad."}
{"text":"Placed a to-go order, my adult daughter went to pick it up. She checked to make sure there were the correct number of items but she didn't open each container. When she got home she started to place the order out on the table. Unfortunately part of the order was not correct.  We live far enough away, it's hot outside, we didn't pack everything up to take it back. I noticed a sticker on the order that looks like the intent is for staff to check the order. It was left blank.  I called to let them know they should check the orders more closely and actually utilize the sticker. The guy who answered the phone said he prepped our order and admitted he didn't check the order after he asked another employee to finish getting it ready. He asked if we wanted to come back, didn't apologize and said that it was my daughter's fault because he offered to check the order and she refused.  We haven't been to this BWW in a while because of the service at our last visit. Based on this experience we won't go back. For the cost, the food wasn't right and service was less than desirable."}
{"text":"Crappy customer service!!! I will never visit Brookpark's BWW again! I ordered a side salad to go with my wings and it was old and wilted. Informing the manager of any complaints is useless as she thinks the workers at her store can't make any mistakes. I guess that's what I get for ordering a salad at a wing spot. The Westgate BWW has better food and customer service. It's also closer to where I live. I'll never make the mistake of going to the Brookpark BWW ever again and neither should you."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Parking can sometimes be a challenge but overall it's tolerable. Restrooms are clean and they have games for kids/teenagers to do while waiting. Unfortunately, the wait to be seated can take some time including the food. That's why, lately, we have opted to just order for take out to avoid waiting in line and too much noise."}
{"text":"Hate the sauce on the wings. Too sour. I guess its just not my type of food. I had to soak it in water in order to swallow it"}
{"text":"This, hands down, was probably the worst buffalo wild wings we've ever been to. Not only did they give us our wrong order twice, they had slow service, over priced, and it wasn't the cleanest of locations (especially the woman's bathroom).   It takes a lot for me to write a poor review but I just can't believe how it was there and really expected more from such a popular chain."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, service and drinks here! Would definitely return in the future. A+"}
{"text":"I give this establishment a 3 star now because it's the go-to late night spot down the street from the crib. After going to Distill for awhile, the wings here are still much better. The bartenders here after hours are always kind and willing to go the extra mile to make sure satisfaction is met.   Only a three star because we have had to return the wings many times because they were served warm or cold. But bartender always made the proper correction. This is why we continue to come here when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I will say I have come here before and gotten good service from one of the bartenders Jeanette. She treated me awesome however the last two times I came in I received horrible customer service and issues with my food. This last time I eas thr only one at the bar it was 4 hours before close and still the bsrtender paid no attention to me . he tried to hurry my drink choice when I was asking about what beers they had on tap. Then once i got my beer he disapeered into the kitchen and didnt come back to take my food order for 20 minutes . then took my order snd disapeered again. My food came out quick but it was supposed to be 6 bone out and 6 bone in wings except I was missing two bone in wings.  And the bartender never came to check on me if it was okay . so I never got the problem with the wings corrected.  so I just ate my wings and left. Also 17 dollars for a combo of only 12 wings and some chips is a horrible deal. Do not get the combo they try to upsell. Total rip off. And horrible service. If there is only one person at your bar and your not busy you should not just be in the kitchen ignoring your bar. I even saw bar tickets pile up and he was no where to be found ."}
{"text":"The food is always okay. But I came in on Friday night and purchased 30$ worth of food not including tip, and Raul forgot my Blueberry Mint Lemonade. So I just gave money away... that's what we're doing now Raul? My order was wrong when he originally gave it to me. Maybe that's why I overlooked the lemonade until I got home. Smh. Somebody honor something this is crazy."}
{"text":"Lol   yea I still keep coming for punishment smh in there defense Garlic Parm extra wet wings are awesome if extra wet drinks nah Shot of Tequila Corona back makes dining in bearable and the game tablets. Ordered online pickup for 9:14 still waiting.  I see Angelica is still here she doesn't wear her name tag but it's her she made this lady wait 10 minutes for an extra side of ranch I guess because she told her she put two in there but the lady wanted another one. What could've been a one minute thank you became a you're gonna wait until I want to get another ranch lol that's Angelica.. 9:18 so anyway I'm still waiting Angelica said she had to go to the bathroom so I took this opportunity to ask her replacement for my wings still waiting I get its V Day so they can get the 3stars which is really for Customer Service alone I decided to get my money back at 9:25 I  no longer craved the taste"}
{"text":"I'm proud to say that I'm a Blazin' Challenge winner and t-shirt bearer at this Buffalo Wild Wings. Whuddup chicks.  Buffalo Wild Wings is one of those places that I come to only if I have a gift card--I put them in the same bucket as Applebee's, Chili's, etc. Don't take that the wrong way--this isn't to say that I don't like places like those, in fact their food is usually consistent and sometimes I like to know what I'm getting into before I leave the house. The most fun parts about this particular BBW is hanging out around fellow Sun Devils, eating wings on a special pricing night (Tuesday for bone-in and Thursdays for boneless), and playing the free fake-money video poker (feels like I'm playing with someone else's paycheck, good stuff).  I don't think I've ever ordered anything other than the wings. Wings definitely don't disappoint--I recommend the Caribbean Jerk, Honey BBQ mixed with lemon pepper (special order), and Blazin' (not for the weak-hearted). I've noticed that BBW's wings are a bit meatier than nearby Native New Yorker--this may just be me, however. Drink selection at BBW may be good for some, but they don't really have anything special when it comes to beer which is a personal disappointment, but I can get past this to have a good meal.  All in all, pretty good for what it is."}
{"text":"We've been here for two hours and I'm about to be late for work because the food has taken so long to get here. I've repeatedly told them that I need to leave and they have been incredibly slow in every aspect of their service. The food wasn't even that great. I will never ever come here again."}
{"text":"I Googled this location and it led me to a wrong address. 20412 Center Ridge Road.  I provided the correct location in this review.   My wife was complaining that she was cold. There was cold air blowing from the ceiling. It's winter. Shut the air off. We moved tables because we were cold. It didn't help.   Service was good. My diet coke tasted like soda water. The wings were great, I had the Caribbean Jerk and the hot.   Again, we did enjoy the food, but damn it was pretty cold in this place.  Our bill for our family of 3 was under 40 bucks.   I would go there again...on a warmer day."}
{"text":"Best buffalo wild wings chain I've been to!  The food is the same from any other buffalo wild wings so I would not be commenting on that but what I will be talking about is the service! Service here was excellent, the server always came by asked if we needed anything and food came by quick. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"This had to be the worst experience i have had yet. It was my friends birthday and we showed up around 10:45, sat down and went to order drinks. Well one of her friends didn't have ID, she wasn't even drinking. The server told us that bc it was after 11 that he couldn't serve any of us and that she had to go stand and wait for us somewhere else while we all ordered (which i understand i am in the industry) but We were there before 11! Service took so long to get to us that it screwed up my friends entire night. Then we had realized my friend had misplaced her car keys and so we went back in and asked and we were told that they were found and put in the office but that no one there at that time had a key to the office until 730 AM!! That doesn't even make sense. So after telling us That they had searched where we were sitting and had cleaned it \"thoroughly\" I checked and her keys were laying right under the table where she was sitting! I was just very unhappy with the customer service and professionalism towards us last night. I wont be back. Let's just say you lost about 6 customers last night."}
{"text":"It's a very loud sports bar. Kept having to ask my server to repeat himself. Lots of large screen monitors with multi game sports channels going on. The food is good. Really good. I ordered the Big Ribs with spicy garlic sauce. My son got the nacho burger. We both shared the cheesecake bites. Warning: let them cool off a bit befor you pop one in your mouth. If it wasn't for the sound level, I would have given it a 5 star review. I will be back."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were working the night shift close by and decided to order some food from here. We called in our order and the girl that we talked to was great. She was bubbly and very helpful and thorough with our individual meals making sure we got everything we wanted. When we picked up the food we got that very same employee who continued being helpful throughout the process.  We finally were able to sit down to enjoy our food during a slow spot that night. The food was great. Our orders were accurate and we even had enough napkins for the mess we were about to make.  I personally ordered the jack daddy burger with wedges. The burger was juicy and loaded with toppings. I died a small death while eating this. The pulled pork was a definite plus on the burger and of course if you're going to go to bww you have to get their wedges. It was a great way to spend my cheat day.  I would definitely go back here as the entire experience was a positive and easy one! Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"It is fun environment to watch sports or play trivia. The servers are always friendly and take good care you. The menu has wings with many sauces to choose from. Don't forget fries or the chips and queso. They have a nice selection of beer and a tall glass will certainly hit the spot!"}
{"text":"food is very expensive and the staff is meh....  the only thing that is worth it is the assorted platter for 15.99...the waitress made a big deal when my boyfriend sipped my beer"}
{"text":"We came here beaten down after a horrible experience in Vegas. Stephanie wasn't our server, but she took our service from already good, to completely over the top. This girl is amazing, my faith has been restored in humanity because of her!"}
{"text":"Placed a to-go order through Grub Hub and after an hour of waiting for our food we were notified that Buffalo Wild Wings canceled our order because they were too busy... really?  I've also been to this location about 5 times as it is right by my house and I always forget this location sucks. Customer service is not good and for whatever reason the wings here are always drenched in too much sauce.  I'm certainly going to have to drive out of the way to go to a different location."}
{"text":"That type of night when you need something good to eat at 2 in the morning. 24/7 open no matter what day!   I continued my night with a couple beers of Blue Moon. Ordered some street tacos. Street tacos comes with a three snack-size soft flour tortillas filled with garlic-tossed grilled chicken, house-made pico de gallo, their southwestern ranch dressing and fresh cilantro. Great way to start my meal!  Completed my meal with a large traditional wings with bourbon honey mustard and honey bbq wings. Perfectly fried and sauce evenly spread with some drip once I picked each individually wing up. Dunked it on some ranch for extra boost of flavor.  For a group of seven people, there was plenty of seats and little wait time.  Plenty of big screens to keep us entertained. Love the gigantic restaurant space.  Great customer service for 2 in the morning meal. Soothing music on the background to keep the mood going."}
{"text":"Great place to have a late lunch after the crowds leave. Very cold beer and great appetizers. Love the Chicken Quesadilla!"}
{"text":"Great Food! The spicy garlic boneless wings  were Great!  The waitresses are Really Nice.  It's a Fun Place to watch a BiG Game!"}
{"text":"If this bdubs wasn't so close to my house, I wouldn't have gone a second time.   We moved to the area a few months ago, before that, we frequented the Hualapai location. This is the second time I've ordered pickup here and the last.  The first time I ordered a large pack of wings, various sides, and of course a chicken tenders and buffalo chips meal for the kiddo. They forgot the kiddos food, but of course I was charged for it. After setting everyone's plates up and sitting down for the movie, my son opens up his box and all there is is some French fries. I went back to pick it up and caught some attitude from the young lady at the front desk. Not only did she not offer some ranch, chicken, or an apology, they couldn't even offer up a side of manners.  The second time (today) the same thing happened. I figured I'd give them another chance, especially because my family loves the food. Guess what, the tenders and buffalo chips are missing again. I don't know what it is, but maybe that combination is just bad luck. The wife is heading back now to pick up the missing items, since she doesn't want me causing a scene. So I figured I can vent on Yelp instead.  Next time we decide to get bdubs, we'll be driving a little farther.  If it makes a difference, the first time I ordered via phone, second time was via the app. Both times I was charged for the missing items, and they were listed on the receipts.  Now to wait for the rest of the food while the wings get cold. Thanks for nothing!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Huge BWW fan, but this location just had the worst service and manager needs management knowledge. No other BWW has taken 40 minutes to bring our group our alcoholic beverages. Just bad service all around. Best bet, go to the BWW on Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"My regular place to go. Wings and flat breads are always a great choice. Bartender Kimmie always keeps the beer cold and service is great."}
{"text":"The only reason I come here is because I LOVE the Thursday Bonesless Wing Special $.70/wing. I love the different flavors, especially the honey bbq & Caribbean Jerk! I usually order in the minimum increment of 4 wings, because that's usually a good amount for me. I'm usually stuffed, but that's also because I order about 2 other random flavors, depending on my mood. I do like to enjoy the southwest loaded chips because it is one of my most favorite bar/happy hour items. I remember coming here years ago, back in the Wet N Wild lifeguarding days with my good friend Charlie and getting more bang for my buck, when it came to happy hour!   I do like how close this location is to my house, so I definitely like to come when I've had a stressful week and want to chow down on some yummy wings, or 'nuggets' as a lot of my friends call it!  I have a good relationship with some of the servers, as I am somewhat of a 'regular' so they definitely take care of me when they see me."}
{"text":"This has to be the best late night happy hour in all of Las Vegas. I love going here after I get off of a long shift at work for $3 Absolute cocktails. They have a great beer selection if that is your thing & the staff is very sweet.   The late night food options on the Happy Hour menu are decent. It certainly is not 5-stars but it fixes the munchies. I usually stick a buck or two in the machines and have a fun time. Its a great place to go with friends because everyone can afford a $10 tab!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at the bar yesterday. The male bartender was very friendly and provided very fast service. I had the Buffalito/Salad combo. The bartender didnt seem annoyed that I only wanted an Ice Tea to drink which was cool. I am not local, so I probably will not be back. But if you are in town and in-need of a quick lunch, def stop in!   They have my fav beer on tap! 312 Goose Island. Try that if you have never had one before :)"}
{"text":"Exceptional service with new great tasting menu items that compliment the fresh feel of the renovation. My server was Erika and she went above and beyond in delivering quality food, along with a memorable experience."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. We have eaten here twice recently, but only because my wife is pregnant and has fried pickle cravings. The food is atrocious, from the wings, to the sandwiches, to the burgers, even the mac & cheese in the kid's meals. The wings are supposed to be the main attraction, yet they were a strange color and cold as if they had been sitting out for a while, not to mention the taste was bland. Even frozen TGIF wings that you can buy at the grocery store are better than these. My sister had a burger which was black, thin, rubbery, and just plain disgusting. I had pork sliders which were as dry as a bone, even with BBQ sauce on them. My son had the mac & cheese kid's meal. The mac was cold and hard and stuck together, the cheese tasted horrible on it. He loves mac & cheese and would barely touch this stuff.  The waitress (same woman both times) was a snaggletooth with a mouth full of decaying, yellowed teeth and she reeked of cigarette smoke...kinda makes you lose your appetite. She brought us the wrong thing a couple times or forgot to bring certain meal items.  Overall, I would highly recommend staying away from BWW. Awful food, crappy service."}
{"text":"sssssssslllllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.   There were only a couple other tables of people in there and it took forever to get the food.  The food was fine, but not worth the wait.  I expect this place to go out of business soon."}
{"text":"That's the only Buffalo Wings location I've been to, and it seems like a strong chain to me.  Well-planned floor, smartly designed menu, overall settings are quite reasonable for a sports pub.  I'd say they overplay the \"sports\" theme quite a bit (and it's, frankly, so silly to associate sport with beer bellies, but oh well...) However, service was quick, friendly, and useful.  Food made this place a 3-star to me, as it wasn't bad, but very much a \"we are franchise\" rather than \"we have our kitchen\" style. Drink selection was also reasonable, though not too inspiring.  Overall, a solid 3-3.5 stars place to go (.5 stars for easy parking). Not something to dream about, in my opinion, yet totally visitable."}
{"text":"I have to rate this a 1 star just so I can tell you how horrible they actually are!!!  Ok so we decided to eat here because the Olympics are going on and what a great place to probably watch some of the games whilst enjoying some wings, right?  Um nope, not at all!!   First we had to stand at the front and ask if they could please turn at least one of their many screens to an Olympic sport, after much debate on which screen would be turned we were able to have a seat.    We were escorted over to a table that was still dirty from the prior guests and just as we were about to sit down the host told us \"WAIT!!\"  \"Let me wipe that down for you\"  Underneath the table had what appeared to be a days worth of straw wrappers and those rings that go around the napkins.  They do not seem to care about what the floor looks like.  The booth was covered in food particles also but they never bothered to wipe the seats off, just the table.    10 minutes went by before anyone came to even take our drink order, yet the server that did finally grace us with his presence had walked by at least 8 times prior to taking our orders and made eye contact with me each time.    I ordered Iced Tea, the other two people in my group ordered a water and a Coke Zero.  He could not get the order right, I had to tell him two more times that I had ordered an Iced Tea.  I was afraid that he might not come back for awhile we placed our order, you know having 10 minutes of sitting there waiting for a server we all had more than ample enough time to decide.  We sat another 10 to 15 minutes before the drinks came back and when I was handed a very brownish in color Iced Tea, which tasted like coffee grounds.  It was horrible!!  I had to wait another 15 minutes before anyone came back to our table so I could ask for another drink.    The server that did come at this time was a girl, completely different from the first server that took our official order.  She dropped the trays where we would put our bones onto the floor and then laughed just seconds before asking us \"Oh did I drop something?\"  I DO NOT KNOW!!  I was not paying attention to you doing your job, I am trying to enjoy my time with my friends.   She apologized for the disgusting tea and took my drink order and walked away.    We actually even noticed our first server taking a \"to-go box\" to the people behind our booth and dropped it on the floor upside down, he literally picked it up and proceeded to hand the clueless customers the dirty \"to-go box\"    Two of us actually ordered wings but we had no where to put the bones and nothing to even clean our hands off with, well I should take that back, we each received the one napkin that was rolled up with our dirty silverware.....and yes they were dirty, every piece had dried up food on it!    Another server, different from the two that had stopped at our table brought me my drink and we had to again ask for napkins and a place to put the bones, several minutes later a 4th server came to drop off napkins and a little tray for the bones, not once did anyone apologize for any of this bad service and not once did anyone ask \"HOW IS EVERYTHING?\"  Had they bothered to ask I would have been completely honest and told them that the service was horrible!    I actually had to leave the table to wash my hands in the bathroom since we were not giving more than 2 more napkins but most importantly, no moist towel things.....YET a table across from us that were participating in an eating contest sure did have some.  Towards the end of our meal a manager walked by and picked up the small cardboard tray/container that the 2nd server dropped on the floor and finally a 5th server stopped by our table to see if we needed refills, I just asked for the bill so we could leave.    The best way to describe this location of Buffalo Wild Wings is it sucks!!  I have eaten at many Bdubs over the years in Michigan and they all have had very minor issues but have all been a very fun time, I will NEVER eat at this location again and it has really put a bad taste in my mouth about trying to go to any other one in Nevada for that matter!!     It has been 2 hours since I left and I already have a terrible stomach ache which I can only think was the chicken, I did not get anything spicy this time so I do not think it was any of the sauce and the funny thing is the name of our server on my bill was a completely different person that we never even met named Frank!!!    My advice to this place is to get their stuff together!"}
{"text":"Food and service both are really good. It's more enjoyable on game day."}
{"text":"Wing night is Tuesday for the \"traditional\" wings, which are the closest flavor to the \"originals\" at Frank and Teressa's Anchor Bar, you'll find anywhere. I think their special is .45 cent wings. Other specials throughout the week.  Great wings, friendly staff, nice open surroundings. It will even be nicer if smoking is banned from the bar area. Park around back, you might not see the BWW sign from the main road. I think there's an Applebee's out front you'll see first, but this place is worth searching for.  Order \"traditionals\", with a little sauce on the side, maybe some cheese (wedge) fries in case your tongue catches fire.  I don't want to sound like a (non-smoking) nut - but I'd like to leave an establishment and not take the smell of smoke with me on my clothes and what's left of my hair.  These are the best wings available from any national restraint or fast food chain. Go to the website and find the map to find the closest restaurant to you - http://www.buffalowildwings.com/  There are four in the Pittsburgh area and one in Erie. Other restaurants have opened in MD (3), NY (14), DE (3), VA (15), WV (5), NC (10), SC (4), DE (3), VA (15), TX (50+).   You ask is it worth making a trip and using $4 a gallon gas to find these restaurants. You're darn right its worth it."}
{"text":"Had a horrible customer service experience I eat at BWW all the time in Cali and compared to there it's crap here. I was waiting for our beverages while the waiter was standing across the restaurant clowning around with customers and other waiters. And kept making bull crap excuses to why he was taking so long when I could have clearly seen home messing  around"}
{"text":"Food was good but the drinks were horrible. Wasted 15 on watered down disgusting drinks. Tastes like watered down strawberry beer. So my husband ordered a different drink and was told their blender is broken. My husband and I told the waitress about the drinks and she just gave us a plain ole \"Im sorry\". At that point we still had full cups. No offer to exchange or refund. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"it is simply not acceptable that this location does not show UFC fights.  Each time I've called the worker on the other end has been nothing short of rude.    The reason they do not show the fights is \" because we don't make make a profit.\"  Yes.  BW3 is a corporation and up until now I really enjoyed the food and location.  They make plenty of profit at the other locations where customers are lierally jammed into the door standing to watch the fights.  Forget you B dubs.  I would rather pay to order the fights at home then to frequent your business anymore."}
{"text":"Food is decent but the service is bad, really bad. Placed an order to go for 10 boneless wings with ranch and they tried to charge me $18+ dollars. Told them I've never paid that much and was then told they made a mistake and adjusted adjusted the price to $11. Was put on hold multiple times, maybe they are understaffed but nonetheless it was a frustrating call, can only imagine what it would be like to actually sit down and eat there. Do yourself a favor and go to wingstop"}
{"text":"The staff were extremely friendly and attentive, josh and Kayla were at take out and treated me with kindness and respect, very nice people, will definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"Came here for our son's school fundraiser. We will not be back. Waited about 20 minutes for a table when there were many empty dirty tables.  It took 40 minutes to get our food and the place was half empty. They delivered my onion rings 20 minutes before the rest of our order. They forgot my son's kids meal and when it arrived the wings were not mild so we told them to take it off the bill. My husbands burger was over cooked and dry - not one drop of juice came out. No extra napkins delivered at a wing place.  Super disappointing"}
{"text":"The service here is usually very friendly. The wait staff isn't incredibly attentive, but the wings are usually prepared well, and it's certainly worth going for a good discount on Wing Tuesdays: wings then are 60 cents per. I prefer boneless, hubby gets the traditional: I'm glad they changed the discount to either option."}
{"text":"Don't come expecting good service.  Food is usually solid. Expect a hassle getting seated...even if waiters outnumber diners 2 to 1.  While it is a huge hassle to get someone to take your order, they actually pay people to wander up and ramble about your experience.  Beyond stupid execution.  Not sure what the issue is, but it's bad. And I come here on average once a week. (When not in a rush and craving wings.)"}
{"text":"Popular spot on Tuesdays for the 45 cent wings. The wings itself are only mediocre but I do ldike the sauces. Wild wings cafe is better, cheaper, and just blows this place out of the water, even on Tuesdays where it is two for one."}
{"text":"I have not seen any buffalo wings that don't have any special but unfortunately found one near North Lake Mall. We went here to watch game along with some hot spicy wings but it was Wednesday where they play a game. I enjoyed little part of the game but get annoyed after a while. I went here to watch the game with my cold beer not to get bordered. I love the wings at Buffalo wild wings with cold beer but will not recommend here on Wednesday."}
{"text":"Good wings but service is not the best! They try hard but young and inexperienced! But always nice!!"}
{"text":"Eh, this place was eh ok.  This place was packed on a Saturday night. We waited about 15 min to be seated.  We got onion rings, boneless teriyaki wings and the honey BBQ. After awhile all the sauce tasted too tangy. We couldn't even finish. I had an email coupon for a free snack size. The waitress forgot to put that on the ticket. We had to wait a really long time for the waitress to find her manager to add the coupon to the bill. Needless to say we were still hungry later.... Definitely should have gone somewhere else...."}
{"text":"First time here and came for lunch got sat down quick wasn't busy at all. Had the lemon pepper chicken boneless wings and they were great. Probably my favorite. The waitress also did a great brought refills without having to ask which was nice. I would come again and try out something different on another lunch day."}
{"text":"Worst Service in the Madison Area!   If you're able to make the drive to the East Town location you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My soda was watery my wings tasted like if was microwaved. My wings weren't defrosted well enough maybe thats why the meat didnt fall of the bone easily."}
{"text":"Great place. They got rid of the BOGO traditional wings on Tuesdays.   Tyler was great server. I'd come back cuz he was awesome   Food was pretty good. I prefer traditional over wingless so it was ok.   Restrooms are clean. Place was clean.   I'll be back"}
{"text":"If I can give this -0 I would, not for the staff but for the management was awful whoever was the manager tonight needs to be fired and put him in his place, he was so arrogant and was not customer service oriented at all, I have never been more disappointed in this location that I have been tonight I go here weekly and And this manager tonight was so upsetting and  disrespectful, was such a bad name for Buffalo Wild Wings, I felt sorry for the staff and could tell they were so disappointed in his behavior"}
{"text":"Why anyone would come here is beyond me. It is the epitome of a chain restaurant; over priced with below average food and service. I ordered a top shelf margarita and asked for light ice, since there are no prices on the menu for the drinks, I assumed it would be a decent size with good taste. My drink was a 1/3rd full and I was told \"that is what happens when you order light ice\", it was awful and almost $11!! Horrible service at the bar. My buffalito's came out with onions after I specifically asked for no pico de gallo/onions. This is just one example of 3 horrible visits. We have finally learned our lesson!"}
{"text":"Horrible Service. It wasn't even busy. It seems to be a reoccurring thing when coming to this location! Last time I was here I received horrible service while seated in the bar area so we wanted to try the regular dining area in hopes of better service. Unfortunately, the dining area experience was worst than my previous bar experience.   Upon walking in the host did not even greet us. We asked him to be seated in their not so filled restaurant. Being seated 5 minutes, the manager had to walk over to bring out menus and ask for our drink order. At the time we were seated there were only 9 tables and four servers on the floor. There are 30 tables on the floor so theSo my question- what the heck is going on?!?!   After some time has passed, our server Brian comes and asks if we need more time to look at the menu. Really?!?! We've been seated nearly 15 mins and our menus were closed!   So it gets worse. They bring my salad out first. No silver ware! I sat there trying to get someone's attention until waitress finally grabs it for me. Who delivers a salad not making sure there is silver ware? On top of that they completely messed up my order.   Our waiter did not check on us once. When he finally came back we asked for our check. It was the worst BWW experience I have had and it sucks because my boyfriend loves it and we go often but after this visit I don't think I'll be going to this location any more."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service/cleanliness/reliable b dubs out there. I will for now on drive across town to the other locations to avoid this. The people are rude, lie about wait times, and the orders are never correct. I was recently there and got food to go.  Ordered 2 items and both were screwed up I will provide a picture of what we received. Just disgusting. I love b dubs but will no longer visit this location."}
{"text":"Preface: I LOVE B B Dubs. I would live off Boneless Asian Zing wings if it was socially acceptable and wouldn't kill me.  This place deserves negative stars. B Dubs corporate needs to clean house here. The wait staff either had no training or just really doesn't give a flying f... I've been here several times and it gets worse. Here's some highlights:  Came here with a group of 7 for lunch wen the place was dead. Our waitress took 5 minutes to move two tables and a chair next to each other. Like, she literally did not care. Took forever to get our food, again, when the place was empty.  Another time I came with coworkers. Throughout the night we order drinks and people filter out, all on separate checks. The waitress charges random items to people's bills and ends up arguing with us over her charging the wrong things to people. Plus she had no idea what beers they still had (looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for one of the beers that was listed on the menu...)  Came here for lunch with friends. One of our friends doesn't eat meat. He orders nachos and didn't realize the chili has meat on it. When they come out my friend sends it back and asks for no chili, since he doesn't eat meat. He wasn't pushy about it at all, sort of a \"my bad, didn't realize this had meat.\" The waitress proceeded to throw a completely age inappropriate fit about it out of the blue. Seriously, we aren't pushy or obnoxious and it was ridiculous how she acted.  I've got even more stories. Luckily, It looks like this place is suffering because it went from being packed to mostly empty since it opened. This place deserves to close."}
{"text":"Every B Dubs (Buffalo Wild Wings for the great unwashed) location is completely different. Yes, it's true. Each location has its own quirks and subtleties. I'm not too big of a fan for this location.  I ordered my staple, 12 boneless Asian Zing. What I got were 12 bone-in (tee-hee) Asian Zing. Since I ordered carry-out, I didn't notice this travesty until I got home. It ruined my B Dubs meal. The wings were all-right here  and the Asian Zing sauce was as tasty as ever, but I was just let down. The bone-in and boneless experience are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Oh, and I got fries. Won't do that again."}
{"text":"Friendly disclaimer - I am VERY particular about my wings and well - they just didn't live up to my expectations.  Considering I had wings and strips, I think I will save my money and go somewehre else next time. I have to be fair and think others might enjoy - just not my thing."}
{"text":"Football Sunday is always a good time! The wings are good and the service has always been prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"I have to give this BDubs a 5 star because they always come through for me. We usually sit at the bar (me and gf) and almost always have perfect service.   I gotta have blazin sauce. And with Wing Tuesday, it's a perfect wing storm.   I've had some negative experiences here, but this is my spot and my goto for wings close by. Kind of like voting for your bestie in a karaoke contest knowing they can't sing ;)"}
{"text":"Newly renovated, this location maybe the nicest looking bdub's in Las Vegas.  Service was good, food was good.  Great place to hit up after your night shift.    Caribbean Jerk Traditional Wings rule!  But what happened to those awesome \"Cheeseburger Bites\"?    Any executives from Bdub's reading this, do us favor and bring the \"Cheeseburger Bites\" back!"}
{"text":"BDubs is one of the go to places to get some wings, and I would totally agree only if you like \"saucy\" wings. If you're a dry-rub type of person, then you will probably prefer Wingstop.  Service is okay. My drinks took a while to get refilled, but at least the food came out quickly! It was a little hard trying to flag down a server for the check too."}
{"text":"Luiz is the best!! Definitely love the friendly staff and the relaxed atmosphere . Can't go wrong with chicken wings of course plus there's a Tuesday boneless special.  Whatever you order they give you double for same price. So if you pay for 8 you get 16. Amazing deal tbh especially for big groups. I highly recommend it. When u come to this location ask for Luiz cz he's truly the friendliest ever"}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports. Lots of tvs even in the dinning room. I was there on a busy night and the service was on point. I can't really complain about anything in the service  Food was average but it was in the smaller side.   I'd go back only for a sporting event."}
{"text":"Seriously, what a disappointment. My wife and I have come here twice because of gift cards. Both times the food sucked. Wings were over cooked and chewy, the soft pretzel was HARD AS A ROCK (but they did take it off our tab) and the chicken fingers are clearly frozen crap they heat up. I really hate getting gift cards to this place, so when we do we just go for drinks. I first had this place in Kansas City and it was a favorite of ours, but the one in Scottsdale is the poorest representation of how awesome this place could be.   Replace the food with quality food and we'd come here. Bartender was great, but when we sat at a tabke you had your typical spoiled Scottsdale kid who doesn't understand service.   Not a fan of this place at all, but really want to be."}
{"text":"I was in a week ago again with some friends we came in around 11 knowing that they close at 1.. We were expecting to be out by then but none of us got our food til 12:30 when we ordered at 11:20. We waited over an hour for a side of fries, pita chips, snack size of wings and two chicken wraps. Then there was another table who ordered beers at 12:40 not know last call had been called because no one bothered to tell them so when the manager came over to their table she was as rude as can be.. And refused to give them their beer. I understand that it's annoying when you close in 30 minutes but it wasn't their fault it was their server who didn't reply the information onwards. Management and staff needs to get their stuff together."}
{"text":"Why don't they EVER run coupons ???  It's really frustrating. I remember getting coupons in the mail but it's been a Long Time.  We love Buffalo Wild Wings and do frequent several locations but seriously a little LOVE to your customers would be much appreciated. ????"}
{"text":"We our huge fans of bdubs as my husband is a HUGE wing lover. So every state we have lived in we have frequented our neighborhood buffalo wild wings. But I have to say this location is hands down THE best! They are always accommodating even when they are packed. They usually have a lot of staff ensuring everything is quick.  Craig is by far the best server there. He will make sure you have a fresh drink before your glass is empty. He remembers everyones orders without writing them down and just has a positive friendly attitude. But all of the servers have been great, even during happy hour/sports games when they are swamped they do a great job with a smile on their face. Food always comes out hot and delicious, also appetizers come out on time. Just very efficient. I will not go to any other buffalo wild wings in Las Vegas. This is our favorite spot we go once or twice a week with our toddler and we all have a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant some people are expecting a fancy place to eat, but a great wing joint and an awesome atmosphere to watch any game."}
{"text":"Just your average Bdubs--the service here is pretty good. I've never sat in the dining room; whenever I go here I always sit at the bar. I think this bdubs does a much better job at spinning the wings in the sauce so they are actually covered. I usually go here for their boneless wing night on Thursdays, and if I'm there during happy hour, the bartenders do a good job of pointing that out to me so I can take advantage of their drink specials. This is the bdubs that I use to make comparisons to when I go to other ones. There's a great atmosphere here when I watch Cleveland Browns games."}
{"text":"Roaches! A group of us liked to go after work and usually had great service but the last time we went we saw several creepy crawlers, when mentioned to mgmt they acted like it's normal to have roaches in the dining area. I will never return!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now. Both times there was no hostess when we walked in. So someone shouts at us to seat ourselves. And both times we tried to sit we were told we're trying to sit in a closed section. How are we to know this? No signs. Rude employees both times. I would advise sitting at the bar because the bartenders are nice."}
{"text":"I love BWW but this place is horrible. Service is always bad weather it's take out or dine in. The first time I ordered pick up. Got there waited 10 minutes not one person greeted me they just looked at me and consistently ignored me and no one was at the front desk. I was so irritated finally someone comes out says my foods still not ready after stating on the phone it would be ready In 15mins (now 25 mins). 2nd experience today for lunch the greeter was depressing. All she did was stand at the front head on the counter watching tv. Our waitress barely spoke to us other then to take order and check on us maybe twice in an hour in a half. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good food for a chain.  Like that they have gaming tablets for the kids. Wings are on past with any chain restaurant.  Come back for the atmosphere of you like sports and bar food"}
{"text":"The best part of my experience at this over priced, noisy, average foods quality wing joint is that the service is so slow that I have time to write this review. Thank you for wasting as much of my time as possible!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Luckily they serve alcohol & play sports to keep customers. Wings were very dry, yet chewy on the inside. My friend got a wrap that was not even worth finishing. Waitress forgot a pretzel appetizer as well as the chips and salsa, when we pointed it out to her she had the nerve to say \"well do you still want them?\" Which of course we declined. She also never took them off our bill until we sent it back for her to correct. Seemed to be no where to be found for long period of time, had to ask other servers walking by for refills. All in all this place was not a good experience. First time ever going to BWW & will not ever be going back."}
{"text":"It's a good place Food is also good Chicken has always been my favorite! But the price is a bit expensive. The environment is very cool... if you are near Chinatown"}
{"text":"I love sports and getting together with friends to watch them. That being said, it's hard to find a place where you can go and watch a game and not feel like you're bothering those around you if they want to watch something else. Buffalo Wild Wings at Cedar Fairmount, however, erases that problem all together. There are a million TVs at which you can watch a game, play interactive trivia games, etc., and it's a great place to take a group who can't decide on what one thing they want to watch -- the Indians or the Tigers? The Cavs or the Lakers? The Browns or the Steelers? Although these should all be easy answers in Cleveland, in case they aren't, BW3 is the place to go.  The first time I was here was for a pre-opening soft launch, and service was exceptionally slow. I can't complain, though, because the place was packed to capacity and, as such, the kitchen was running at a much slower pace. Plus, all food was free and drinks were dirt cheap. I was impressed with the quality of the food and our server, despite it being her first night as a waitress, was helpful, informative, engaging, and all-around fun. I got mini corn dogs (DELICIOUS) and a chicken sandwich, which was pretty tasty.  The second night I was here for for the NBA Draft so the place was, again, packed. Serving speed was up, though, which was impressive. Our server, Marco, was a blast. He remembered everyone's orders without writing them down (a feat which never ceases to amaze me), and even warned us that a large party was coming in soon, meaning the kitchen would start to get backed up, so we should put our food orders in sooner rather than later. I appreciate knowing bits of inside information like that; it made me feel like he truly wanted us to have a good experience. This time, I had a chicken quesadilla, which was fantastic. The salsa they serve with it was spicy and fantastic, and it's definitely a meal I would get again.  I will absolutely be returning to BW3, and soon -- maybe for a Tribe World Series game or LeBron's Decision, Take 2?"}
{"text":"The wings are so bad here. For a place that has \"wings\" in its restaurant name, I expect at decent wings. These were just awful which is just sad"}
{"text":"July 29th is National Chicken Wing Day but every day is a good day for wings! Give me dem waaangs!  Lemon Pepper and Ghost Pepper Wings are the way to go. Knock them back with some Four Peaks brews or Kiltlifter and it's perfect. Wings so thicc that Nicki Minaj is jealous! Nobody does wings quite like Buffalo Wild Wings but the staff here can be rude.   They're at a great location full of night life and good people so I keep coming back. Keep doing your BWW!"}
{"text":"This place was odd from the time we walked in. We were seated right next to the A/C that was on the floor in the corner. We asked if we could move and the host just moved the A/C a foot over. We said we're not sitting there and he sat us in a booth. When we sat down in the seats, they sank down about 4 inches. Haha. Instead of requesting another table again, we decided it would be fine. There were 3 of us and we ordered our food. The waitress got my sister's order wrong. Of course we realized this when the wings were brought out. She said it would take 10 minutes for them to cook up the right order. We shared our food with my sister, but it took about 25 minutes for her food to come out. When things like this happen, I don't usually expect anything other than an apology. A discount is nice if they offer it, but not necessary. Anyway, the waitress didn't apologize about getting the order wrong nor for the time it took for the correct order to come out. This BWW is below par of other BWWs I've been to."}
{"text":"Food was good and arrived in a timely matter. But dang that bartender Cindy tho,  she looks like she has soft skin colored eyes and blonde hair, yes, beautiful but boy is she the damn devil in disguise. Don't let her looks deceive you! I repeat don't let her looks deceive you. She will put your lime in your drink instead of on the rim of the cup, she will pour half a shot in your mixed drink instead of a whole shot! She will give you dirty looks when you order another drink. She slides your food to you and expects you to eat it with your fingers till you actually ask for knife and fork when you obviously need it to eat boneless wings. She will ignore you till you yell out her name. An attention seeker if you ask me."}
{"text":"I love sitting in the bar area and enjoying a drink and some wings. I haven't had a bad experience at this restaurant ever. I will say I have had a few slow service days but nothing major."}
{"text":"The chairs are too close together in the dining area but the food is always good. Lemon pepper traditional are always good with a blue moon.   Chile con queso dip for an appetizer is never a disappointment. Always so fresh and tastes soooo good."}
{"text":"This location is in a very busy part of the city and traffic tends to be a tad crazy over here so be prepared. We were a very large table of guests at BWW for a Friday luncheon and considering how rowdy I know some of these people can be...it was a great time. We were there for about 2 1/2 hours and our waitress Allyson did a great job with everyone. A few things here and there were forgotten, like a ranch dip or side salad, but overall it was great. Looked like everyone enjoyed their food, and we also received a 15% military discount on our tickets which I know was appreciated by everyone."}
{"text":"I didn't pay for the food, so can't tell you about the prices. Tried one Asian Zing and one Korean BBQ boneless wings. They were too heavily breaded, didn't like the sauces.   Chicken quesadilla was pretty good, once they removed the flour tortillas. It was nice that they removed them as I requested. The server was pretty nice for a bar.  Prices are not marked for alcoholic drinks in the menu."}
{"text":"I have been sending my adult son here to pick up food on Sundays for several years now.  With a few exceptions (see previous review) things have been ok until about the last 6 months.  I normally order about $100 worth of wings/apps/sandwiches,...etc. online.  Just about every time for the past several months, the food has been delayed 45 min to an hour past when the email said it would be ready.  Lately, they have messed up the order, and if they know what \"extra sauce\" on the wings is, they sure don't show it.  Last week, they were cold, and dry as a bone.  About 6 months ago, they charged my AMEX five times.  Not sure how much longer I am going to let them have more chances."}
{"text":"I go to bww all the time from California to Arizona & the block of Orange was the worst location that i been to in California but for las vegas nevada this should be ZERO stars it took 35 minutes to receive the appetizers then it was incorrect & we couldnt see the server anywhere? I go to the hostess & ask for a manager because i dont want my appetizers getting cold, i explain & then the complete order comes out... Another maybe 20 minutes the main course food comes out... When speaking to the manager i said i dont KNOW if this is busy but this is horrible service & manager said no this isnt busy but we have 3 new cooks... My thought is the food tasted good still like bww always does but the service all around sucked!!! Sure the manager took it upon himself to get food out faster & served it himself... But he could have comp the cold appetizers... Basically saying HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE"}
{"text":"Excellent service from our server Karissa very friendly & totally people friendy loved it especially on my Birthday thank you bdubs"}
{"text":"Poor service. Hard to mess up an order for only 3 people. (Wings and side salad). Manager came by to make up for it. So we left less irritated."}
{"text":"It was a bit crowded but not enough to take 5 minutes to even be acknowledged. Got a table for us. WINGS were amazing. Service was friendly but SLOW and/or didn't really see us. It was very hectic, so maybe they're understaffed. Wasn't a fan of their appetizer platter. Everything turned soggy pretty quickly. Wings appetizer re the way to go. Very loud but nice large TVs inside."}
{"text":"Service was really slow, no one ever waited on us. When we asked for a table the hostess told us to just order to go because they were \"backed up\" there was NO ONE in the restaurant. The experience was beyond frustrating."}
{"text":"The best service, best prices and absolutely the best eats on the strip aside from, what I would imagine, a $60 steak or fish should taste like. Highly recommended. Our bartender was fantastic and the beer was cheap and cold! And for the strip, a $4.75 tall domestic is CHEAP!"}
{"text":"The Buffalo serves wings, boneless wings, boneless wings sandwiches, and salads that can be ordered with or without wings.  I like my wings with the bone, otherwise known as tradition wings.  There are some twenty odd flavors.  Currently, I get half hot and half Thai curry.  Top that off with some fries, ketchup, carrots, and blue cheese and you've got yourself a lunch special.  The loyalty card is a nice perk, $5 off every few meals or so.  The servers are very generous with the punches.  And if I ever managed to fill out the survey from the receipt, I would be saving even more moolah.  For a little bit, I was using SCVNGR to unlock some deals.  It is an app that requires you to complete challenges, and if you get enough points, you can unlock deals.  It was fun for a few weeks, but then seemed like a lot of work.  They've also got drinks, but come on, man, this is my lunch break."}
{"text":"A little league team filling half the bar area. We sat in the bar, and the  a whole little league team or two were sat next to us for a post game meet I believe. I found it odd that they would be sat in the bar, and not the dining room. There was a whole dining room avalible. We asked to be moved to the do in room since I was out for lunch to be away from  my own  kids and didn't really want to sit in the middle of 30 14 year olds.    There was confusion as to who would serve is or where to seat us since we had placed drink orders hut not food yet. I feel like no one was really taking care us us, everything took twice as long as it should have like the server was forgetting to come to the table.   We ended up waiting for drunk refills and eating with a missing g sauce since the server failed to come back until 15 min after out food was delivered.   The manager offered me a credit on our next bill and assured me that he had spoke  to the staff. But this restaurant is almost directly in between my sister and I which I why we chose it. So I doubt I will make it back down there in the time frame to use said credit and even if I did I would be driving past  many restaurants where I am almost sure I would get better service.."}
{"text":"The whole place is pretty awesome. Great new building, TVs everywhere, friendly staff, trivia, etc. the food is very good. I would recommend the wild wings if you like spicy! Very spicy, but a GREAT flavor!"}
{"text":"First time at this location, got take out and everything food-wise was consistent with any other location I have been to, I was picking up take out.  The number of televisions was pretty amazing - no empty wall space at all here.  The set up is a lot different with no counter order area right at the entrance, instead they have a hostess stand.  Still very sports bar-ish but with more of a restaurant look/feel."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times on and off over the past few months, and I have to say, it's not half bad.  Plenty of seating, staff and a decent menu selection.  When I'm here, I usually sit at the bar, and so far so good.  I've come here for happy hour, and they have some pretty decent specials.  I usually get the chili and cheese dip thing, and a beer depending on how I feel.  They have domestic taps on special for happy hour, and the selection is pretty good.  I think unless it's on tap and domestic, they won't put it on their happy hour menu, so you have to pay full price.  (I tried to order a specialty beer one time and this is how I found out.)  They have plenty of TV's and seem to host events here from time to time. Things such as raffles and a variety of other items.  Staff is friendly and helpful even when busy.  The last time I came here was Friday night, and that was okay.  I went with a plate of 8 boneless hot wings since I was to late for happy hour, and they came out a bit spicier then I had anticipated, but were tasty none the less.  The only setback was they served them to be in a cardboard tray instead of a plate, so when I was cutting them up with my fork and knife, one or two half's flew out and I was like WTF.  Granted, I may not be the most graceful girl in the world, but when food starts flying and booze isn't involved, I can only wish I would have had a plate instead.  The service here is pretty good, and never really had a bad experience.  They have a bazillion TV's so you can always catch some kind of sporting event no matter what it is. I also like that they have free trivia, and I play from time to time depending on if I'm alone or not. I never do very well, but hey, it's fun!"}
{"text":"Oh B-Dubs. Came here to watch the game and chat it up with my homeboys. They ordered some nachos and a couple of beers. I didn't eat so I can't really judge the food, but they seemed to have dug the nachos with chicken. Although my personal preference is to have some extra chips to scoop up straggler toppings, they were fine with the chip to topping ratio. It was a pretty standard B-Dubs experience. The only thing that could have been better was the way the check was handled. Homeboy put the gentlemen's nachos on my bill, even though they and only they consumed them (I didn't even order them...so that was confusing). I mean whatevs. We figured it out. Then once we were ready with our cards, we waited a good ten minutes for him to reappear, which he never did. We went inside to try to pay but this seemed too much for ye old B-Dubs to handle. Other than that, an average place for average food and average experiences."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review at Michael's Frozen Custard, just up the street. Why? Because we walked in to BWW for our first time ever. The restaurant was not busy. The hostess did not greet us, and seated another party. She never came back. She walked past once with still no greeting, and didn't come back, again. We waited nearly 5 minutes while a line grew behind us, then left."}
{"text":"Their new temporary menu with the potato wedges has to be one of the most amazing items I have ever tasted off their menu. They do have an incredible happy hour and a full array of choices on their menu. The only thing I don't like is all of their sandwiches have to be ordered well done. I can't order any of my burgers medium rare which really sucks so I just stick with the appetizers and wing menu"}
{"text":"I go here every couple of days for lunch good food service varies by person all in all I would suggest you have a bite here and lunch specials and beer specials are pretty good!!"}
{"text":"Chain. Service was better than other reviewers seem to have had. Food tasted alright going down, but we both were I'll the next day."}
{"text":"We got a medium boneless honey bbq and medium boneless chipotle/honey bbq mix. Both were great. The chipotle rub is was spicier than I remembered, but still really good. We ordered the honey bbq chicken salad for my mom which she really enjoyed. All around, good experience."}
{"text":"Can I give this location no stars wow. By far the worst b dubs I've come in contact with and there isn't much expectation for me at any of them but damn this one sucks. 5 separate occasions over the last 3 months have forced me and my company to find else where to have meetings. Save yourself a headache and go to the Sardis one if you are wanting to eat within a hour of ordering and for your food to come out right. Not to mention the attitude problem from almost every employee"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday after usually going to the uptown one although I hate the location and have never had good service there. This location has won me over thank god"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for my wings for an hour and 20 minutes now. The service here sucks and it always has. Corporate better send in a professional to this location to step up their game. This place sucks, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets such bad  reviews. We had great service and excellent food. All the servers check in on you regularly, even if it's not their table."}
{"text":"Great experience with Summer at this BDubs. I'm not a big fan of of Buffalo Wild Wings service but Summer was super friendly and on it! I'm coming back soon. Food was what we expected, went with the Asian zing wangs."}
{"text":"If I could rate lower than 1 star I would.  Went in and waited to get served...bartender was chatting with her three friend's at the bar...wait staff were hanging out in a corner.  No one would serve us...they walked by several times and ignored us.  Place was almost empty.  Awful treatment.  Don't go there."}
{"text":"2 hour wait for food then got wrong food as well... Then Manager does not even come out to apologize.... Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the place is were i first went for BWW and i was sold after the first time we would go once a week to this place until i moved back to CA now there is one out here and i still go all the time"}
{"text":"Review #25 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  My husband and I were Buffalo Wild Wings regulars back when we lived in Minnesota. We'd go every Sunday lunch to watch the NFL games so we were so excited when this one opened and we can continue our Sunday tradition.  The wings here are a bit different - the batter is a little thicker and the chicken is a little bit drier but overall they're still tasty and enjoyable to munch on while drinking beer and watching sports. The version of the bleu cheese dip here doesn't have the little morsels that sticks to the batter and is less rich. Service is excellent. Everything came out quick and our servers were very attentive. When they noticed us watching the football game, they asked if there were any specific game we wanted to watch and they switched one of the screens to show the game we mentioned. Our overall experience was great and we will definitely be going back to watch more football games!"}
{"text":"I was there last night with a friend at the bar and the guy helping us  Brian P wasn't good, we had to repeat our order because he didn't understand what we wanted, when our request was simple. We had to call him several times over when we needed something because he never came around to check if we needed anything, he forgot my friends drink at one point, customer service was not friendly, and It was just half ass."}
{"text":"they are NOT open 24 hours you stupid tourist..the BAR is open 24 hours however the DINING ROOM CLOSES AT 11. This place is the shit  the service is bangin and the food is awesome. Some of you are impatient and like your food cold and raw, me? I don't mind waiting a few minutes for HOT COOKED FOOD. I would go back again"}
{"text":"The food was good but the server was nowhere to be found. We had to have the person running food AND the host track down our waitress.  Watch out for the $0.60 ranch charge. We didn't even touch the ranch! We didn't ask for it. We were a couple of hungry guys who wanted wings and beer , on a slow night , and our server made it impossible. We wanted to order several rounds of food and beer but couldn't since we didn't have a server. If your cut, fine, whatever get someone to cover your section. I can't bring myself to come back, I felt like I wasn't wanted here at all."}
{"text":"Will not come back!.. BWW.. You're in my banned list from now on.. What is that?! Because that's not even a wing.. It looks like a fried piece of who knows what.. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Ridiculous service. No one answers the phone for order, and after calling multiple times to finally place the order we had to wait an additional hour because the order was not ready. This was on an average Friday night. To top it off they forgot the order of fries so we had to wait again for them to make it."}
{"text":"Great burger. Friendly staff and very reasonably priced. Went there after visiting NASCAR Hall Of Fame and thought everything was spot on. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Awesome food as always but the parking sucks here and the service was a bit slow. Nevertheless the food rocks."}
{"text":"For a place that is supposed to specialize in wings... The wings are so mediocre. I gave them several opportunities to change my mind, alas no. Cold beer, lots of tv's & pretty good service are they redeeming values."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. Our food took almost an hour and the place wasn't even full. It took another 20 minutes to find the manager and he spoke so poorly of his staff. It was so terrible. Do not give them your time."}
{"text":"I placed an order of boneless wings and they gave me traditional instead. The manager corrected my order and I left with a smile. 4-23-15 visiting date and time was 10:30 pm."}
{"text":"One word: SLOWW!!! My grandmother in a wheelchair moves faster than these guys! I came here today with my parents and I have to say if the food did not make up for the lack of service the restaurant would have a piece of our minds! The thing that got me the most was the guy that I managed to flag down had the nerve to point his finger at me to wait. So I did because I saw he had waters to deliver BUT get this! Instead of coming back and acknowledging us about what we needed nope, he just walks past us numerous times!! And don't get me started on our waitress...Overall, I can see that these people working today were very territorial over their tables instead of working as a team. This is a strong reflection on the manager who just walked around aimlessly and voiced no control whatsoever.    If there is even a next time I'll bring my pet turtle and see who serves us faster."}
{"text":"Terrible service! I waited 1 hour for 1 order of large wings and fries! Additionally, the food was cold after one hour of being \"cooked.\" Will never go back there!"}
{"text":"I do generally like BW3's but this location needs some serious work.  I was excited when I first moved into the area that I was near a B-dubbs but after about 3-4 visits to this location, my mind was thinking differently.  I have seen over the past 10-15 years the size, service, and quality go down only to see the prices go up.  I truly don't believe you get your monies worth.  Now about this specific location.  Its an old style B-dubbs, service is brutal unless you get a manager to help you.   Orders are rarely correct as you can tell by Chris' review.  As a matter of fact, this is unheard of, but I ordered 6 wings and a beer a year and a half ago (last time I went in) because I had 20 minutes to burn, but to my surprise the server brought me 5 wings, 5 WINGS!!  Can no one count??  I can see if I ordered 12, 18, 24+ but 6 frickin wings and they still F'd that up.  That was if for me at that location.  How it got voted on Fox 2010 Hot List is beyond me.  Do yourself a favor and go to Panini's or even Hurricanes for wings, both are a better value.  On a side note, I do love the Spicy Garlic Sauce here, its still one of my favorite sauces, especially knowing that it's not butter based."}
{"text":"Typical Sports Bar times 10.... Bigger, Louder, and more TV's than I've seen in one place.  The food is good and spicier than you'd expect.  They sponsor a lot of great youth sports groups and offer some really good deals for being part of one of those groups."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  As others have said, one of the worst BWW experiences ever.  I've been to 5+ locations between here and in California, and this was bad.  They just want your money, don't care about service, and have smaller wings than other locations, and charge for veggie sticks (I think), and they charge for sauces too!"}
{"text":"AVOID,  AVOID,  AVOID. Used to go here 3x a week, but it keeps getting worse.  Tonight was the final straw . Put in the same order I always do, small wings half and half on the sauce. Server told me they can't  do that. Nice guy, I explained to him I order this a couple times a week. He went and got his snowflake manager who told me they won't do that and haven't in 6 months. Told him I did that twice last week alone.  Snowflake told me too bad, it messes with their numbers, so in summary, long time customer is told to piss off. I own a company with 50+ employees and we do policy changes all the time, and they're not always popular. However,  we would never treat anyone with the disregard that this kid did. We won't be back and we'll be very vocal to everyone to AVOID."}
{"text":"There are 3 reasons for this rating:  1. Don't get me wrong... I love their sauces but when I ask for extra wet, I expect to see the wings dripping with the sauce. But, no! There was hardly any sauce forget about extra wet!  2. It was a pretty simple order and still they messed it up. 3. I still love your sauces"}
{"text":"This review is for the manager Julie:   The credit card machine broke down and we did not have cash on us.  The staff told us they would reimburse the ATM fee if we withdrew money. Unfortunately, our credit card charges an additional $8 bank fee which Julie did not want to reimburse.   We politely asked if she could reimburse us for both fees since we were eager to pay but did not want to be charged unnecessary fees because of the broken machine.   She got ignorant with us and made it sound like we were a pair of degenerates and offered to 86 us from the location & call the police for not wanting to pay....  We DID want to pay but we wanted to avoid excess transaction costs!!  She went and disappeared in the back for 15 minutes, and showed no signs of coming back out.  The bartender apologized to us and said we could leave.   We left and never saw Julie again.   Yes we're going to complain to corporate. She was highly unprofessional and rude."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service ever! I begin to place a to go order with JENNIFER who doesn't want to communicate with anyone else that it's to go or where it is, so I'm just sitting at the bar for about 20 minutes until I ask for my food. By then the food is cold and no one says anything about it. Neither do I, except for the fact that I will never be back. It's just kinda silly. That no communication is had amongst this place and that I had to pay for cold food. How would you feel if you had to pay for cold food? That you SPECIFICALLY ordered Togo? Weird right?"}
{"text":"This location is so convenient for me being that its right down the street. I come here frequently I love it. The service is always good. I love there happy hour menu. The lemon pepper, garlic parmesan, and Asian zing are the most popular flavors I love them. Im a little disappointed they keep raising there wing prices on Tuesdays. Just a few months ago they were only .55 cent. They recently raised the price to .70 cents a wing. Other then that I have no complaints."}
{"text":"The service was slow for it being so empty.  We asked for a refill on our chips and never got them.  The naked chicken strips came out cold and tasted as if they were thrown in the microwave and reheated.  I loved the company of my party but that was it.   I would not come back again."}
{"text":"Although I have never received great great service at a buffalo wild wings you always know what you are going to get when you step into one.  I usually just go when they have specials on wings which for this location is Tuesday but it makes that trip worth the while.  I'm not going to the greatest wings of all time but for the price you can't beat it.  They do have a new salt and vinegar seasoning that is really good but can sometimes not be enough seasoning.  But with the selection of wing sauces that they have and the price, it makes for a good night on Tuesdays when we are craving wings."}
{"text":"I always say it's a hit or miss with this location. But tonight I stand here waiting almost an hour now for a table. I know it's fight night, I expect it to be busy. I come here for every fight. It would be different if the staff were friendly, but I've talked to 3 different people working and all have been very short. At least reassure your guests you will be with them shortly or that you are working on a table for them, but every interaction I've had with the staff, I've had to go and ask myself. The last time I went and asked I was told I probably wouldn't have a table until after the fight. Again, I get it, but it's not what was said, or that I'm not getting a table. Its how it's being said. The rudeness among every staff member I've spoke with. I definitely won't be coming here anymore for the fights, unless something magical happens tonight that changed my entire opinion of this place."}
{"text":"This is the very definition of bad customer service. I ordered over the phone expecting for the food to be ready once I arrived. Once I entered the facility I had to wait 15 minutes for someone to show up. Constantly being told someone will help me soon. Once someone finally showed up. I was handed less than fresh food. The lady checked the ordered and ensured me everything was there. I had people waiting for be so I took her word for it and headed home. Once I arrived home I noticed a large order of wings was missing. It too me a long while to get there and even longer to get back home. This entire experience was horrible so I rushed back and just ended up returning the entire order. They didn't care about the my experience and just wanted to rush me out the door. The lack of caring and empathy shows they are focused more on the money and less about the customer. I would avoid this place at all cost"}
{"text":"Good service and good food. Lots of TVs but not all of the booths are optimally located for great views. Remodeling right now so maybe that will change"}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!  This breaks my heart, as I'm a die-hard BWW fan.  This location, however, is the WORST.   My biggest problem with it is the parking.  They put this location in the Nascar Hall of Fame in Uptown Charlotte, and the parking options are either a meter on the street, or the Nascar parking garage.  BWW used to validate parking, which made it about $2.00 / hour.  Today, I was informed that they no longer validate, and I paid $7.00 to spend 2 hours at BWW.  The food is OK, the service is OK, but the staff is not friendly at all. I'll go to the Sardis Rd. location from now on.  Great staff, free parking, better food."}
{"text":"Gawd, I love B-Dubs.  I've honestly NEVER had a bad meal at one.  EVER. This one was no exception:  great food, nice atmosphere, TVs all over the place...pretty standard for BWW. My only apprehension is with the employees the owners hire at these places.  There's nothing they can do, though...students and people in their late teens / early 20s are the candidate pool for foodservice jobs.  I've had great servers at some BWWs, and really bad ones at others.  When I first walked in this one, there were 11 kids talking right at the entrance, completely blocking my path to the bar.  I had to ask them to kindly move their collective ass out of my way.  It looked like a mall entrance on Friday night.   Other than the jackoffs working at this one (the server-bartender wasn't solving any equations between pouring beers), I have no problems whatsoever.  Keep up the good work, B-Dubs.  You have a lifelong client in me!"}
{"text":"BWWs are so hit-and-miss anymore that I never know what kind of experience I'm going to have.  Earlier this week, I stopped at this location for lunch, and as I always do, parked myself in the bar area.  I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent service that I received from Amy, who was behind the bar.  She not only kept my drink full and table clean, but she was very pleasant and friendly as well.  She also helped me add points and get 100 bonus points using the BWW app.  I wish all BWW folks were this great.  I hope I'll have the chance to go back."}
{"text":"As I'm waiting I see at least 5 tables open and at least 30 people waiting. I waited for 30 min before being seated at one of the 5 open tables. There was one female cleaning tables. I saw the manager walk the floor one time as I was waiting. We finally get seated and I still see so many people waiting to be seated and at least 6 tables open at all times! After we get seated, wait another 15 min (one hour total now) the waitress tells us that the food will be about a 30 min wait. She asks if that's okay... forced to agree because of the time invested, we agree. It has now been 59 min and still no food. She has told us 3 times that she has checked on our food and it is almost ready. This is our 4th time here- don't know why we came back. We will definitely be going to tailgators from now on!"}
{"text":"The only thing worse than the food, was the service.  Wait, wait and wait some more. And if you need your bill, you'll find your waitress chatting with the other servers somewhere. Best go ask for it, or you'll be sitting there all day."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I went here to watch an MMA fight. I knew that it was going to be crowded, but I didn't expect that they would keep letting people in AFTER they told us that they have to let 24 people out to be compliant with fire safety. We were sitting in the bar area and there were so many people, we ended up watching the last of the fights at the front by the main doors.   It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to come take our order, but our food arrived shortly after, and it was alright. Nothing too special, but it wasn't horrible. Do not expect anything but typical bar food. It's also kind of on the more expensive side - given the quality & quantity of it.   Overall, it seems like an alright spot to watch games and fights (clean, a ton of TV's) but they need to become aware of how many people they are letting in versus going out - it's a huge safety hazard. I understand that they are trying to make money, but it's alright to tell people that the restaurant is full. It made myself and many people around me extremely uncomfortable to not even be able to move around at our table without bumping into people."}
{"text":"This review is for the staff member Serena. She was extremely rude to the group and I that went in today. Someone complimented her hair and she says \"thanks\" with attitude. When we tell her we're ready to order she says (with attitude) \"okay.. Let me get the drinks out FIRST.\" We ask for a new server because obviously we don't want someone with bad customer service serving us, and she tells us she's a manager and they don't have any servers. WHAT? My mind is blown."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!!! Warning! It is dirty loud and the management do not have a clue how to run the place with providing great service.   My husband and I went here to watch a nhl playoff game recently. We usually head to our watering hole Steiner's though decided to switch it up!  Totally bad mistake. We sat in the bar and after about a 20 minute wait for our order of drinks we asked if they can change a tv to show our game . That took another 20 minutes. Then the unthinkable happened. We noticed a staff member getting off duty (still in uniform) getting a seat at the bar. She sat and chatted with a couple servers while we waited for our drinks and the game. then it happened! after chatting with a couple servers, one  of them went over to the tv programming area and turned up the NBA game so loud the whole bar was looking around . they left the volume at such a high volume everyone in the bar just spoke louder. It was sooo loud!  We asked the supervisor to please turn it down and she said the manager requested it be this loud. then we asked if they could make an exception since there was 4 or more games on the big screens going on and who wants to hear this blaring volume! she shrugs and walks away. Then we decided to leave. We can celled our wing order and left. Then my husband asked to speak to the manager . Angie (the worst manager I have ever met) comes over and we explain (more like yell!) and express that there should be more staff in behind the bar and also to respect every ones ears and preferences of games they are watching in the bar.  - not just the manager who is off duty and sitting in a uniform in the bar! how unprofessional. she shrugs and says in a snarky voice \" well, I am sending backup staff!\" turns her back and walks over to the off uniformed duty staff that's watching the game in the bar rolling her eyes.   we are about the leave the restaurant and I grab the GM (Maggie's) business card. We ask the hostess to speak to her. She comes over, friendly and timid and apologizes for the lack of professionalism and horrible service. She then tells us she has only been on the job for 2 weeks and I can see why! Poor girl has a big job in front of her and I wish her the best with that staff . We will not come back and do not recommend this place at all!"}
{"text":"This place definitely is the headquarters for March Madness.  I came here and sat for literally 3.5 hours and the waitress was extremely friendly.  The drinks werent too expensive either: $4 for a well vodka.  Also, B-dubs always has the most and some of the best sauces to choose from.  I have never had one that I did not enjoy.    Side note, gotta come here to check out the happy hour soon.  Half off apps and $3 jack and cokes and Absolut mixers.  Plus you can play some trivia all night long.  Sorry if I beat the other players too bad."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many many times, and over a 4-5 month time frame, every time we have gone here it has gotten worse. From poor service, to cold wings that were not fresh and looked like they were sitting there for hours, charging my card for the wrong table multiple times, (check your receipts before you pay), to messed up to go orders, it is terrible. Unfortunately, we decided enough was enough and we will never step foot into this location ever again and have found other places to eat around there that have good food, and friendly service. This location is going to keep losing customers if they keep up with the way they are currently doing business."}
{"text":"Walked in to be greated by a rude hosts, she asked if we wanted to be seated in the bar, I had my 14yr old boy with me so I said no, then she rolled her eyes. She proceeds to escort us to our booth and tries to sit us infront of a table of about 12 where I have to shift my body sideways to fit. I tell her can we sit at a different booth where it doesn't feel as crowded? She rolled her eyes again and said sure.  Then our waiter Rocky comes up and sounds miserable. He asked us what we wanted to drink with an attitude. After taking our drink order he takes about 10 minutes to come back with them....alll while I can see him just standing and talking to the other waitresses. He comes back with our drinks drops a straw and comes back 5 minutes later with my straw. He goes back to talking with tbe waitresses goes checks on a table walks around the seating area and then comes and asks my son if he ordered a snacksize of wings or the small. At this point he finally goes and puts our order. The service was awful!! My boyfriend, who was also with us was afraid to eat because he thought the water would do something to the order since he seemed not happy to be there.  My son liked his wings, and I liked my nacho burger. That's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars"}
{"text":"Food is typical of bar environment- fried wings and burgers. Not bad. Really like the mango habanero wings. My two star poor rating stems from being refused entry at the door b/c a game was starting in 1/2 hour and my family (myself, husband and two small kids) were there only for dinner- not the game. They told us we'd have to pay an entry fee to get in for the game... it was 6:30 pm...we just wanted dinner and not to pay an entry fee to a place where we were spending money on food anyway!"}
{"text":"I hate chain restaurants, especially BWW, but I like this location in particular because if it were a person, the middle name \"Wild\" would be totally earned. It's between a bunch of bars, so you get all the alcoholics who have the munchies, yet will NEVER get drunk enough to actually want \"food\" from McFaddennoJack'sVille, which somehow manages to be even worse. Otherwise, they're here to pregame, and are clearly up to no good from whenever to 2am. Eating here is a total shitshow; the early stages of a series of irresponsible decisions.   And I like it that way.   The awesome staff hushed everyone to congratulate a patron enjoying her 21st birthday. Before any singing can commence, she turned her attention to a stranger with a smug smile across the room, stood up, and yelled out a deafening \"FUCK YOU!\". Half the restaurant erupted in laughter and confusion while she pounded her drink and her friends appeared to hastily ask for a check.   There was smoke billowing in from the patio. I have never seen so many people lighting up at a restaurant like this, many with only drinks in hand. It was being treated more like a dive. Builds character. Meanwhile, I totally tried to convince my friends I was sober before laughing so hard I spilled my beer on the table. It was that kind of night.   My inspiration for this review was meeting a BWW employee from far away, and telling him about this experience. Turns out this particular location has a reputation for being too gosh darn rowdy, and no one except servers hoping for exorbitant tips from the nice drunk people want to put up with it.   So you might think this is a family establishment, but it sure as hell is not, so if you want to pay a visit, leave your snot-nosed sex trophies at home and show up ready to laugh. If you are upset or think I'm a snob for not liking BWW, or just plain unfamiliar with this chain, and sorely disappointed that I'm not reviewing the food, then thanks for reading so far. Everything below this sentence is the boring stuff.   ........................................................................  The reason I am not particularly into BWW is because I feel they take traditional bar food that's really cheap, yet somehow manage to make it simultaneously more expensive than competition while of lower quality. I mean, even Applebee's serves up decent potato skins, but BWW gives you extra-wide french fries with a smidgen of cheese and ground-up bacon. Their boneless wings have way more breading than they should. The coating is really heavy and dry, reminiscent of the cafeteria chicken tenders in middle school. They feel like they've always been under a heat lamp. And they NEVER have enough sauce. It's like they just lightly drizzle it, and I taste it in every other bite. Their hot wings mostly aren't hot, either, you have to go for something unorthodox like mango habanero before you get a sensation, and even then the flavor is undesirable. Tastes real artificial, as though the sauce is composed of mango candy, liquid smoke, with pure capsaicin thrown in because actual habaneros were too expensive. Those burgers look radical though, and someday when I'm dragged here again I'll try one because it's my last glimmer of hope and I could not possibly be more disappointed in their food."}
{"text":"How do you screw up an online to go order that is clearly written out for you? I don't get it. Tonight, I ordered the Boneless Large with 3 sauces: Mild, Spicy Garlic and Lemon Pepper. The mild and Spicy garlic I asked for EXTRA WET. Anyway, I get there, my order comes out to be $20.54 and I tip 20%. My mistake. The girl at the front brings out my order and quickly goes over it. After the 2nd box, I stop her when she says \"Honey BBQ.\" No big deal. Everyone makes mistakes. She goes to the back and gets my Lemon Pepper wings. And I head out after she mentioned the Mild. I sit in my car and go through the bag and realize the first box was Medium. I asked for Spicy Garlic as my 3rd choice. So I take my daughter back out of her seat and head back inside. I tell her I'm missing the Spicy Garlic and she goes back in the kitchen and brings them out. I guess the main reason why I'm so bothered is not because they messed up the order really, even though my bag had a receipt with the exact sauces I asked for. I'm more bothered at the fact that the boxes they gave me were disgusting. It seemed as if the cooks mixed the sauce and wings with their hands and then put them in the box and closed the boxes with their dirty hands. I also asked for EXTRA WET and I did not get that AT ALL. Overall it was a very unpleasant experience. To go boxes should be clean and presentable."}
{"text":"One of the better BWW I've been to. Being in the middle of Henderson, I was surprised at how many Seahawk fans there were at the bar. Happy hour specials run from 2-7pm during the week, which includes $3 well drinks, $3 domestic beers, and $3 select appetizers. My only complaint was that food took forever to come out, but I'll give them a pass since it was a busy night with the biggest Monday night football game of the year playing. I'll probably never come back to this location again due to proximity, but it gets a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"BBW is a great place to take the family and have a beer and some wings,watch some sports and watch people.  Yes its mostly bar food but its good bar food. The main reason I go is the owner Gail gives back to local community and schools and is not greedy about sharing and helping others. I have never met her,wouldnt know her if I saw her but I have seen the things she has done for the local teams,schools and even churchs in this day of political correctness.  Thumbs up, thanks!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.   The waiter was very attentive and polite.  Love the buttery maple dipping  sauce.  Chicken fingers were good.   I thought the potato wedges were too spicy hot.  I also wish the curry dipping sauce wasn't as spicy either.  Nonetheless,  still tasty items, i just couldn't eat much of either.  The only item i did not like at all was the salsa that came with tortilla chips.   Too sugary sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a few different locations in the West and S.West area of Las Vegas.  The places are typically busy and loud.  Too loud for my comfort.  It's difficult for me to hear my friends over the televisions and occasional yelling kids.  I typically order boneless chicken.  I noticed that they added shrimp po-boys to the menu.  The first time I wanted to order one BWW (a different location) was \"sold out\" of the shrimp.  The second visit months later at this location I was able to get one.  I was surprised how tasty it was and I ate the whole thing!  Portions are adequate and prices are agreeable.  Very good customer service and the bathrooms were clean.  In order to make it a five star experience (at any BWW) they need to lower the volume on the multitude of televisions."}
{"text":"B-dubs is always a good option when your craving wings and fries. I almost always order for pick-up but the inside is the same as any other BWW. plenty of screens and enough beer for everyone."}
{"text":"Allllllrrrrrriiigggghhhttttt soooo B-dubs! Fantastic place to come eat at, if you haven't already figured out that it's a sports bar it is! And if u are like me that isn't a huge sports buff no sweat they got lots food, lots of beer, and lots atmosphere to be around. So the food is pretty awsome obviously their things g are wings, they have tons of wings sauces and dry rubs to pick from all categorized from non spicy to spit ur mouth out, and lots of sodas and non carbonated drinks along with beer mixed drinks and a couple things they can mix for u if u need them to. One thing I would say it be nice to see some X-game sports on there maybe on a couple of screens not everyone is into the main sports, a lot of people that skateboarded, biked, surfed, etc. Also the reason they are not a 5 star place for me is that the consistency of their service has not been as great as I would expect, a lot of times associates get caught up talking to themselves and then u see customers getting up to look for associates, no good. But like I said that doesn't apply to everyone I have had visits that are fantastic and can't judge the whole establishment on a couple of bad experiences. Check it out ull have a good time"}
{"text":"We were here late at around 1:30 am in the morning. Even the restaurant is not so crowded at this hour, we got great service from our waitress. She was very attentive and suggestive in our orders. BW3 food is standard across the nation. Food was not bad at all. Wings is good but not my favorite wing in town.   Great service."}
{"text":"We were driving around after being detoured by the 101 fwy closure when suddenly the clouds parted, light shone down from the sky, angels sang, and we saw the Buffalo Wild Wings in the distance. Forest was a BW3 virgin so we had to take him in and let him experience the magic. I really like the layout of this location...you can see all of the TVs from anywhere in the restaurant.   Being since we had just gorged ourselves on Roberto's mexican food we only had drinks at the bar, but we made Forest read the menu while we described each sauce to him in detail. I think we freaked out the guy sitting next to us at the bar when we started asking him questions about his food.  The bartender thought our questions were a bit odd too. Once again, thinking of being arrested and put on a chain gang in the AZ desert, we drank up and left quickly."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Black Friday for some wings, football, and free wifi. The wings were cooked to perfection...we always order them extra crispy...and sauced appropriately. The service was great! Our server Kai was friendly and very attentive. The restaurant has a very positive and happy vibe, and all of the employees were awesome and friendly. Manager Eric stopped by our table to say hello which was very nice. We enjoyed our experience very much and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Nothing like a quick fix when you're having an insane wing craving, which tends to happen to me at least once a month or so, although there was a time that I will unabashedly admit that I ate at BWW's at least 4x a week.  Don't judge!  Anyway, my friend and I came in here the other night around 1am with a wing-craving so strong it ached in our bellies.  The bar area was open and it wasn't super busy.  Our server was great so we got beers right away.  We ordered 18 wings and did half spicy garlic, which is the only sauce I've ever had there, and also medium.  I couldn't really tell the difference between the two sauces, to be honest.    It's true that they are not the best wings as they are quite a bit on the scrawny side, but they hit the spot all the same, as they always do.  They are also SUPER salty and it can get to be way too much, but wash it down with some beer to cancel out the high salt content and you're golden."}
{"text":"We met up with some friends to catch UFC 168.  They had gotten a table outside on the patio so luckily we had a place to sit.  The place was jam-packed inside.  The TV's outside are a little high, IMO, so you're constantly craning your neck up unless you're standing up. Also, it was freezing and I guess their heat lamps died.    On the plus side, they do not charge cover for the fight, which is rare.  I guess beggers can't be choosers.  We had to go inside and order drinks at the bar as the wait staff was completely swamped.  Surprisingly, service was quick and efficient once you were able to worm your way in through the crowd up to the bar."}
{"text":"Came in to watch the MSU game because my bf thought this was an MSU bar. Well, it was not so, but we stayed anyway. We sat in the bar and wasn't greeted by anyone at first, but then the bartender finally came over and cleaned our table and took our orders. Fried pickles, YUM! Our wings also came out fresh and hot. Then we suddenly had a server, which was nice, but we were done eating. LOL."}
{"text":"I'll give two stars only because of the service we received the hostess were really nice, as for the food I will never go to this place again it had absolutely no taste I ordered a chicken sandwich if I knew I was going to waste my money I would of made a chicken sandwich at home."}
{"text":"After a big conference, a big group of us stopped here for a yummy dinner! Service was good and the food was good. We all enjoyed our time there and loved the recommendations that out waitress gave us."}
{"text":"Too many ticky tack changes.  Wings on special but you have to pay for ranch dressing! Service wasn't that good. Not coming back."}
{"text":"If only there is no star at all for the rating! The service is way too SLOW!!!! Server not friendly,seems like always in a hurry but our order still came in late. The gross part is there is HAIR in my coleslaw, I got the attention of the manager and showed it to him, he said sorry but didn't offer any to compensate the worst experience I had when I pulled out the hair out of my mouth! Ewwww!  We waited for 15 minutes but he never came back so we got our bill and nothing offered on our end. Is this how you treat your customers???"}
{"text":"I like B Dubs! They have a great beer selection, many huge tvs, and their food is good. It can get busy during sporting events but that can be the fun of it too. Their menu has the normal pub grub but they are known for their wings ofcourse. Im not a wing person but enjoy the sauces. The jalapeno is amazing! spicy enough to put in a chicken wrap and enjoy. He had a burger and said it was cooked perfectly and had quite a selection of toppings. Not much more to say here, if you are looking for a quiet spot, don't come here, if you like the bar atmosphere, give it a try."}
{"text":"Checked it out tonight. Nice inside as far as a tribute to Cleveland sports. Many high quality TV's as well. If you come here to just drink and watch sports you won't be disappointed. Food wise, I cannot say the same. My husband actually said it was the worst burger he has ever had and said hospital food is better...ouch! It looked like the kitchen had a stack of patties already made and just slapping them between buns as needed. I had a Mac and cheese dish with chicken, it was fine but I prob wouldn't order it again. It actually came out of the kitchen with the sauce sticker on the plate, which kind of was off putting to me. Overall service was good, drinks were cold, food was not. Hopefully they work out the kitchen kinks because they have quite a large size location to fill seats in."}
{"text":"Called and said haply hour ends at 7 PM so at 6:50 we try to get a 2nd order in and server says no happy hour is over because there clock is fast, total BS,  went to manager and same story even though I showed phone then she says all carriers are different, not so, we had att, Verizon and sprint and guess what all exact same time. No silverware had to ask 4 times."}
{"text":"This review is just for the bar area since I did not eat anything.   The service I received at the bar was really good. The bartender was quick to pour me and the hubby a drink. She was also very nice and attentive the time we were there. The beer she poured us was cold and good. I liked that she knows how to pour a beer...meaning that there is a perfect beer to collar ration in the drink.   I visited a Friday around 4:30pm. The bar area was pretty full but there were still spaces available at the tables. The whole area was covered in really big TVs and screens playing a variety of sports. I can see why this place would be good for coming to a big sporting event. They usually have UFC fights playing and are one of the most affordable establishments that charges a cover for these events.  I would def come back here and give the wings a try!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. It was an absolute horrible experience, not once, but two nights IN A ROW. The first night we waited 15 minutes before finally being greeted but the rest of the night followed the same pattern of being ignored by our server while he continously served the table right next to us. The next night the bar wasn't even remotely busy, it was super steady and lots of tables were available. My girlfriend and I waited 45 MINUTES for our food. At 30 minutes our server said \"the kitchen is really backed up\" meanwhile, the party next to us who came AFTER us received their food. We didn't even order anytbing huge, just 2 small orders of boneless wings and fries??? We missed our movie because of their horrible service. Everyone, save your money, don't come here because you will leave unsatisfied and disappointed."}
{"text":"I love BWW. (see review under the galleria mall ring circle location) however upon going to this location the service was just weird. We had just gotten our appetizer, minutes later got our wings. Literally minutes later about 3 min. - she came by and asked us how everything was (typical, ok..) and then gives us the check.??? wtf??? are you serious? I havent even tried the wing yet, im still eating the appetizer you know we ordered.  And you're already asking me for the plastic??  Kinda pissed me off. Then we rationalized she must be leaving. Nope.  I'd never go back to this location. But they get 4 stars for good food."}
{"text":"There are no better wings than buffalo wild wings. I lived in San Angelo where getting a seat  @BWW for a game involved getting there a few hrs prior, then left for San Diego. BLAH! BOO!!! (i once had to pour hot sauce on top of the hottest wings @ hooters, so sad)  they know nothing about wings. We had to drive all the way to Marrietta in Riverside Co. for BWW. I'm so glad we have BWW back again. My fav right now is spicy garlic and the Azian zing. If u like hot/sweet i'd recommend ordering Azian zing/Teriaki. Yum. Spicy garlic is perfect, not too hot like the Wild and not too mild. Crazingly enought I dont order parm. garlic b/c it looks gross. Medium tastes better than hot, just has a better flavor. And rectnly I can't go in here w/out ordering their chips and salsa. Maybe b/c the salsa is ice cold. The bugers are ok, not anything to write home about, but how can you order burgers when they are glorious wings ready to be had??"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Always so friendly to my kids an actually cater to them, they don't have cherry Pepsi but they make it happen for the kids. They have hand held game consoles that are like iPads that they give the kids. Dinner is always so quite. LOVE love love  this place!"}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wind Wings (BWW) in any location but I especially love this location because it's where I was watching the college National Championship bowl game and that is where Texas lost and that obnoxious Texas fan parading around the bar had to sneak out of the restaurant because they lost. Haha. Anyway, I really do enjoy BWW because I love fried chicken limbs doused in sauce. I would say that their service could be a little better but it wasn't so bad that it ruined my meal."}
{"text":"BWW is the only place that makes a truly real hot wing.   I love there wings and chicken tenders.  Sadly the Tempe location is not my favorite.  This location is due for a major upgrade especially the dining area.  The dining area looks outdated, dark and cold does not have the new modern look like the other new BWW. The bar area is nice, it's better to hang out there than the dining area."}
{"text":"Every time I come here , we get the best service by the employees. Even the servers on training employees! I love the queso dip, I love this place because the managers are always involved"}
{"text":"I've on been to BWW a handful of times, but I definitely love it. The wings are always delicious. I don't like spicy at all, so teriyaki and sweet BBQ are my go-tos. I also love the hog wild fries! Cheese, bacon and a sauce on fries? Delicious!"}
{"text":"So my experience here would've really gotten 1 star had I not been able to watch the Cavs Championship parade on Tv. They had it on every screen so that was nice. Everyone in the establishment had on Cavs gear.  And after being at the parade for hours, we were seated immediately which was nice. The 1 star rating would be for the service.  I couldn't stand our waitress. I think she was the worst I've ever had at any restaurant EVER! She really must not enjoy her job.  She was very blah. She never cracked a smile. She did not greet us. She took forever to bring us anything. Got my to go order wrong, which I didn't see until I got home.  On top of the service, My meal... To me was on the salty side. I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries. The fries were great.  But that sandwich...I had to take a sip of my drink after every bite. Everyone else seemed to be ok with their meals.  Except for having to wait FOREVER to dig into their wings because our waitress didn't bring everything that was a part of the meal. Anyway #GoCAVS"}
{"text":"This place was just AWFUL. And I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. First off the server was rude and wasn't happy to serve us. We waited 35 minutes for drinks and a whole other hour for wings, and not to mention the order was wrong so we  waited another 40 minutes. The server didn't even know we had an incorrect order, she came to our table and we told her that the order was incorrect. She got upset instead of fixing the issue. The rest of the night she had her back turned to us as she would walk by and never asked for a refill or ANYTHING. Just awful service. If I could 0 stars out of 10 I would. Waste of money and time. HAHA... and management is even worse."}
{"text":"We went here again last night and the service was better than last time. I got the Honey BBQ boneless wings with NO dry rub (yuck!) and they were pretty good. You definitely don't come for the service, but the wings are pretty good if you don't get the dry rub. The service at the Centennial BWW is better, but when it comes down to it the wings are good and that's all that matters."}
{"text":"Not really pleased with the service and the quality of our food this visit. Cecily was our server. She was nice off the back but I was very disappointed with how she handled my food arriving with a nice big black curly piece of hair in it. She replaced the food and I ate all that I was able to tolerate. Disappointed the fries came out cold but after waiting for food to come and go and come again I wasn't taking anymore chances. Paid bill and the manager never came around to address the hair issue. But it just so happens that one did and I shared the hair situation so he gave me a couple cards for our next visit at any Buffalo Wild Wings. Sorry the hair was a BIG turn off!"}
{"text":"Service is just OK. Your kitchen is slow, perhaps taking some of the servers that stand and chat at the end of the bar into the kitchen would benefit you.  In all honesty your kitchen makes your servers look bad."}
{"text":"This was the first time I have been to this location. The service was good but it was super packed in there.   The food was really good, I had the Big jack daddy burger which I recommend.  I would give this place 3.5 stars just because it was redicoulas packed. I don't mind going into a place with a lot of people but for what ever reason it was extra packed for a Wednesday night.  I would give this place another try maybe on a different day because the food is good and it's a nice environment."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Went on a Thursday night and it was packed. The good thing is that the bar area had seating.  We sat down, ordered some Guinness and some wings with potato wedges. We got the drinks fairly quickly, and the food in about 15 minutes.  The wings were were good but there were a few that were overly fried. The potato wedges were good but could have used just a little less garlic seasoning.  Overall the food was good, the beer was flowing, and the service was good as well."}
{"text":"Okay. It was Saturday afternoon and just found out the Pacman/Marquez fight would only be showed at MGM properties.  We called around town.  New York New York, Aria, Monte Carlo and Planet Hollywood all had the fight.  Unfortunately they were charging around 65 to 80 bucks cover just to watch; not including food, drinks and not guaranteeing a seat.  With three girls and four guys that would be rough. With our prospects not looking good.  We called on a friend to look it up on the internet.  Coming through, she tells us that the fight would be showed at Buffalo Wild Wings and there is no cover.  No cover!  Score.  We get directions and head over.  We are not locals of Vegas so going west of the strip is foreign to us.  We have only gone as far as the Orleans, Rio and In and Out Burger and that is it.  But we get there in one piece and before the fight starts and that's all that mattered. The crowd inside was mixed.  We went there to see Pacquiao win.  More than half of the patrons were going for the other guy.  Proof is when my son came in with a Filipino flag on his back and people were booing. The cool thing about this place was that they had all the sports on-  College Football (Oregon VS Stanford especially), UFC (dos Santos VS Velasquez) and the fight.  It was nice seeing everywhere you looked a big screen with sports.  That night was a good night for sports. We got a table that was perfectly placed by the bar.  We were also near a bathroom.  We had great service and the fight ended up being good but unsatisfying.  I want to see another rematch.  The wings were awesome and the drinks were good.  We had a great time.  This place is a winner."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings treated us out of towners pretty good. Coming for Spring Training baseball. This was one of the last places we dined before leaving the next day. The restaurant chain is known for their wings and TV's throughout. The place did not disappoint on either. The wings were on point. Hot and sauced perfectly. We were also surrounded by TV's. One bigger than the next. The service was above average. The server tried really hard to accommodate our large party. Nice and friendly. Overall, not a bad place to watch a game, drink a beer or two and eat some wings. Buffalo Wild Wings is a winner."}
{"text":"WOW. You would think a place that sells mediocre food would know they need to make up for it with great service. Or in this case ANY service at all. and no it wasn't just my waitress, this was a group effort. My waitress fell off the face of the earth, and I just needed one of the other waitresses to go tell her I needed her. But THEY ALL - ALL OF THEM - turned their heads and opened that patio door and walked away.More than once for some of them. group effort. When I finally caught a waitress's direct look - I told her I wanted my check. instead of being there for the whole football game.  Now I gotta go find another place to watch football and smoke. Not an easy task in Charlotte - a patio with TVs that lets you smoke. SO THAT tells you how bad its here - I am going to give up this near by find because the service was that bad.  Sit at the bar is my advice for you that dont need the patio..........."}
{"text":"I went on Wing tuesday! WooHoo! Those Mango Habeneros are good! $3.75 for a coors light!?!? I'm not sure what is worse, the price or admitting I drank it?"}
{"text":"New Years Day so it was understandably busy. Not good service today. Lots of things were 'coming': water, napkins, cutlery, ranch dressing, refills - none came.   You guys need to step it up, it was service that was not acceptable."}
{"text":"I must disclose that I am not a fan of the 1000 TV chain experience, and this is a review of the bar area.  As mentioned - TVs everywhere you look.  And people on their phones everywhere, too.  It's boisterously loud without actually being boisterous.  There were several of us at a table, mostly drinking - some bar food was ordered.  The food was typical bar fare, the service was very attentive and pleasant.  Drink prices are high, but the location is good - across from Penn Center.  Take your wallet and your outside voice.  Lip reading is a plus."}
{"text":"If I could I wouldn't give this place a star. I'm usually fairly easy going and it takes a lot for me to completely write a place off. Personally I don't see the hype about BBW, even still I let my friend talk me into going. It took almost an hour for us to be seated, which sort of made sense, as there was a UFC on that night. However once we were seated the real fun began. The waiter was really personable at first, super friendly. There were 4 of us total. I order wings and mozzarella sticks, another friend ordered nachos, the third wings and fries and lastly just another order of wings. I also mentioned that we would need ranch and forks. Took 30 minutes to get our food. An additional 15 minutes for the forks and finally 45 minutes after receiving our food, a friend complained to the manager (after multiple attempts of asking two separate waiters) we received our ranch. In between that the original waiter asked if I wanted water, I said yes. Needless to say I never received it. The mozzarella sticks and the fight were the only good aspects of the evening. Wings were way too breaded. Overall, highly doubt I will ever return."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! I know they will probably never see this, but I went here to pick up an online order that I did. And I thought oh cool so it should be ready by the time I get there. So I call just to make sure they got my order and tell the guy that I talk to my name and order exactly what I wanted because he said he hadn't got it yet. So he tells me he will look for it so I say okay and at this point I was already on my way. So I get there and he says that they never got it, so I say well I called and gave my order to the guy over the phone. And he STILL DIDNT MAKE IT! So at this point I am mad and hungry so the guy at the take out counter takes it again and tells me it will be 25 MINUTES! So I am mad and upset, then when I get home to eat after this whole thing my food is COLD! So now I am fed up. So I call the manager to complain and she trys to blame me by saying I never really placed the order, well okay if that is true it still should of been placed when I called in to give the guy my order over the phone. She offered to replace my meal and give me a credit. But I will never be back so why would I want that? I will stick with Wingstop...thanks for nothing!"}
{"text":"Came here one evening with a small group of friends and had a blast.   There was a lot going on, a couple of hottest wing challenges, TV's galore, music and conversation. The music is loud, but no more loud than any other establishment of this type, and I would expect nothing less. With the large TV's I can only imagine how great it would be to catch a sporting event here.   The wings were nice and meaty, the choice in sauces were plentiful. I watch a friend go through the hottest wings as though they weren't even hot in two and a half minutes, I think I would have been in tears for sure, as I tried another friends wings and found myself tearing, and they were not even the hottest. I had garlic wings and found them to be great, meaty, and far from spicy hot, but not too sweet either. My wife ordered the nachos and they were a disappointment, the liquid cheese was not impressive, there weren't a heck of a lot of toppings on them either. It is a wing place after all I guess.   I'd definitely go back and stick with the safe bet, wings and beer."}
{"text":"I used to love this place whenever a UFC or hockey game was on. The crowd made you feel like you were really there thus the feeling of extra friends. I enjoy their beer selection and they have happy hour plus beer specials every night.  The food for me is just Ok, 9 times outta 10 the food is very dry especially the wings. You would think a wing place would give you enough sauce but too often it appears to have dried before it ever reaches the table. Not a good way to serve food. They use to have those smiley face fries which were sooo good but of course they got rid of them. The fries the now serve are thin and flavorless no fun to eat but you do because they come with the meal. I've had the chicken wrap before with my favorite sauce which is the Spicy garlic. It taste really good as does most of their sauces but if they used more sauce i'd up the rating.  The have wing specials on tuesdays and thursdays for their bone-in and boneless wings but i don't even go for them anymore. The beer is probably the only reason why I do go and the sporting events. They have several TV's and and two big screens for the main events. Go with a group it's a lot better especially because of the noise level."}
{"text":"Had the worst time at Buffalo Wild wings tonight. Trying to watch the Royals game with my boyfriend and some creepy stranger comes up and sticks his fingers in my plate and eats one of my popcorn shrimp. Waitress did nothing. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Ridiculous, showing the fight tonight- $20 cover charge per person & line out the door! Other BWW locations are doing the same thing! Why demand additional money when your paying above wholesale cost for food & drinks regardless! With that said, we've been told that for each TV that displays it, its an additional fee?   Hope others can clarify & weigh in on this?!LOL  BTW- franchise locations can do things a little differently : like impose an increased fee. This location and Ellsworth Queen Creek generally take turns rotating between the two location to offer the fights. Tonight they were BOTH doing it & with this $20 entrance fee!  FYI: Corporate ran, managed & operated site may not implement that added expense to their patrons!"}
{"text":"Came in last night about 10:00 PM. Seated right away and our server was Desiree. Took our drink orders and those came to the table fairly quickly. Ordered the new Garlic Fries which had the hot garlic wing sauce with ranch dressing and shredded Parmesan Cheese on top! Really good fries... Got the large traditional wings with Thai Curry ( my favorite), Asian zing ( our kids favorite), Spicy Garlic ( Hubbies favorite) and the Garlic Parmesan (we all like:) Wings came out hot and saucy just the way we like them. We had great service & great food from this location. Was even acknowledged by the on staff manger who came over and asked if everything was ok. Much appreciated!! Have read many of the other reviews regarding complaints about service. Maybe they have taken notes? Our experience was good!"}
{"text":"Eh...let me start with the good points. I've been here several times. The staff has always been friendly & efficient. & the food is delicious, love all the different flavorings for the chicken fingers. However,...either this place is understaffed or just crazy busy. We always wait at least a half an hour for our food. Also I always have to buy a lot of food cuz the size of their fingers are so small. & for what you're getting, it is expensive!!! My husband & I usually pay some $30 or so just for chicken fingers, fries, & sodas. I mean, it's good, but not that good. Because of the price we go very rarely. I prefer wing stop to this place. Cheaper & more delicious in my opinion. I know several people that frequent bdubs & I honestly have no idea how people afford to go as much as they do. If you have the money then this place is great but because I'm a poor person I give 2 stars due to the expense."}
{"text":"Food and service was good here when we had dinner  here on 8/16. However, very disappointing when we were leaving ( about 9:00 PM) to see a man sitting at the bench seats near the entrance with a gigantic blue/ grey pit bull. This dog was NOT a service dog ( no attire stating so). This dog had on a spiked collar and NO LEASH!! Such a big concern for us with our small children- as we had to walk by to leave the restaurant & not to mention the health code violations. I put a call in the manager on duty the next day- Dina who made reference when we spoke: that it could have been a customer that generally comes in with a service dog. I explained to her that this particular dog didn't have any markings as to be a guild type animal.Clearly his owner didn't look like a trainer of that sort either! Dina was to review on their cameras and follow up with me. I have never heard back. I also called their Corp. Office to report this incident & haven't heard from them either? Way to follow up on a very disturbing situation."}
{"text":"After visiting I realize why it has a rating of 2 1/2 starts! It took about 10 minutes just to get welcomed at the door then another 15 minutes to our waters. After the server finally came back with our drinks she took our order but only took mine then went to walk away without taking my boyfriends order. Then our appetizer came out wrong so they had to take it back. Before we could get the appetizer back they brought my food but not my boyfriends about 5 minutes later his food came and our server asked if we wanted her to fix our appetizer (which I thought they were already doing 20 minutes ago) I told her it was fine now that we had our meals. After not being checked on at all we finished our food and waited almost 30 minutes to pay our bill. We were there from 7:15-8:45 and saw our server a total of 3 times. Between the server and manger ignoring us I can definitely say we won't be back! Don't waist your time!"}
{"text":"Dined here on 6/21 about 6:30 PM for Father's Day. Seated quickly & our server was Robert.. Wanted to try the new Moroccan Spice. They had it in stock ( yea) so we tried a sample batch of those- they were very chili powder tasting- just okay :wouldn't order again. We got our usual flavors as a Family Order along with 2 orders of fries. All was hot , fresh & good.  We were visited by the manager while dinning. She came over and spoke with us- extremely friendly & professional.  Service was good, Robert made sure our glasses were always full & checked on us often. We enjoy eating at Buffalo Wild Wings! We were pleased with the service and staff at this location and enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting anything amazing because all their food is frozen but I waited way too long for undercooked wings. And it's also freezing in there!!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, over priced. We wanted to sit outside but while walking in, we noticed how dirty all the tables were. Was really too bad because it was such a beautiful night. Inside the restaurant it needs a good cleaning too. The booth seats all need to be repaired because they are all broken. The floor was completely filthy and waitresses and Hostess people standing around instead of using the sweeper. So dirty in there even the menus need to be cleaned."}
{"text":"The wings are substandard, service was okay. There are so many better places for wings. I don't understand why this place is popular, my guess would be the TVs."}
{"text":"Worst Customer service that I've experienced in a long time. I called to place an order and asked if their wings are breaded like most wing spots. The employee said yes so I ordered the combo with wings with bone & boneless wings and sause on the side. The reviews for this place were terrible but still thinking its a well known place maybe they've changed but no surprise here. Wings look shitty and the hostesses that were waiting on customers were throwing F bombs and using foul language in front of a family which was waiting to be seated. Such a shame, never coming here again and will stick to reading reviews and dodge places like this."}
{"text":"Another wings and beer place... Yay [/sarcasm]  Now that I have that out of the way, it's worthwhile to mention that although Buffalo Wild Wings is just another wings and beer place, they've managed to pull it off quite well.   Inside, it is fairly large, with a \"dining\" area and a \"bar\" area. Both of those are filled with flat screen televisions all over the walls, so if you're looking for a quiet, romantic, or calm place to eat, this isn't it.  The staff is always very pleasant. Every time I have visited, I've been delighted by the enthusiasm and attentiveness that the servers have paid to our meals (particularly when we ordered 16 separate orders of wings, and our server not only memorized our orders, but also who ordered what).  So while this restaurant doesn't really present anything special or unique, it's a great place to eat, have a beer, and watch a game. Much better than the other \"Italian\" bar in this area, who's service has drastically gone downhill.  Oh, and Tuesdays are half price wings, and Thursdays are half price boneless wings."}
{"text":"Service has gone downhill fast. We sat at a table for almost 10 minutes waiting for a server. They weren't even that busy. Employees were standing around when we walked out."}
{"text":"We went to the missisauga location and as always BWW did not disappoint!  The good - service was great, servers are all friendly and quick - food was delicious and came quickly - decor us great especially for sports fans you gave a 360 view of every game (meh for me but great for my boyfriend) - Love that you have salsa and chips as an option for a side! - clean bathrooms, dining area and bar  The bad - None and I actually really can't think of any! Food is top notch! - Branch into Markham/Scarborough"}
{"text":"This is a favorite spot for me and my friends. Good service and good food. I wish the bathroom was a littler cleaner, but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Placed order online, had picture with pickup time. They said they didn't get it, but would place it now if I'd wait 20-25 minutes. Didn't offer a discount for their poor system, or poor service. Just asked if I'd like a water while I wait on them. Don't think I'll ever use them again. 0 stars! Over 45 minutes after my pickup time I get my food. Outrageous!"}
{"text":"Came here for a gathering with some of my coworkers and supervisors. I got the mushroom appetizer and it was good."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the food. But I think they have really bad service. And their cashiers do not pay attention when placing orders so they constantly mess up and you always have to reorder your food. This is literally the second time in a row that they've messed up on my order."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about BWW, but was unimpressed.   The wings platter we ordered allows you to choose 5 flavors. Out of everything the best was probably the original salted one, the other flavors were disappointing. The wings were huge and I liked that there was alot of meat on them, but would not return for food.  It is unlikely that I will return, unless it's to watch a game (there were plenty of TVs).  Tip: DO NOT GET THE NY STYLE CHEESECAKE."}
{"text":"Wings, Beer, Sports, good people, need I say more?  This place is fantastic.  The ambiance and electricity during games is second to none.  Great Happy hour specials from 10pm-6am with $3 beers and $4 apps.  I've been here a few times in the past, once to a funny/horrible story.  Because everything was handled with such professionalism and grace I'll tell you about it.    It was approximately a month ago I ordered some boneless Sweet BBQ wings.  In case you've never entered a BWW in your life, Sweet BBQ ranks number 1 out of 28 sauces.  28 being hotter then the sun!  After my first wing my eyes started to tear up.  My server assured me the wings were correct and I continued eating.  After 3 wings I literally broke into a sweat, and told him something was wrong.  The manager came over and took the food back.  When he returned with my new freshly made sweet BBQ he said aloud, \"Those must have been in the frier with the Jalapeño wings.\"  He apologized profusely and comped my meal.  Everything was handled professionally and with grace.  Tonight I came back to say hello and Shane remembered my face.  It's great to come back to an establishment where people remember you.  See you again soon BWW!"}
{"text":"The team was very accommodating. The server told me all about the specials, hostess got my son a high chair and a crown. Our food came out piping hot so the server warned us about it. Our drinks stayed full and the service was on point. The general Manager Tamika came out and spent some time with my son and I told us all about her community event she was having sadly we live out of state or we would have come. The team made us feel like we were one of their friends and knew what we needed before we needed it. Thanks for being awesome!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food and Service. their host Karissa is very friendly and Bryan has excellent personality and runs the place well. Awesome March Madness experiance for me"}
{"text":"Good wings and reasonably priced. Good sports fan atmosphere. Out of the 4 flavours we got we enjoyed the garlic parmesan wings the most. Very flavourful and saucy, just the way we like em. Will be back."}
{"text":"I came here with a small group on a Tuesday (cheap wings!) I think they were $0.75 per wing. We ordered honey garlic, Cajun, garlic parmesan and medium wings. The honey garlic and garlic Parmesan were so good!! They had more than enough sauce, were nice and crispy oh and the best part --- GLUTEN FREE! Yes, they don't bread their wings and use a separate fryer from the breaded items. Or so I was told ... And I didn't die after so I'm guessing they were telling the truth ;)  The Cajun wings had a dry rub and they were just okay. However, this could have just been because beside the awesomeness of the honey garlic and garlic parmesan, anything else would fall flat. I didn't try the other wings bc I'm not a fan of a burning mouth but I'm told they were good. The service was pretty fast. The guy shouted the number of wings we wanted to the kitchen before he even took down the types in order to get them started. Definitely took way less time than your average wing place in discount night. Under 15 mins. We also ordered fries. They were just okay. Nothing special but good enough. The inside was fairly busy but there was also a blue jays game and a raptors game that night. Not sure how it is otherwise.  Will def be back for some cheap, delicious wings!"}
{"text":"Best wing sauces! I love the options, my favorite are Mango Habenaro, and spicy garlic. Asian Zing and Caribbean Jerk are both popular with my group as well. Good nachos for an appetizer. Great atmosphere when there are good games on. Not a fan of them charging for fight nights... but its not an often inconvenience.  Ask about the monthly beer specials to get the discounted options!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite little place to come down over to after a long night of work. Great specials to be found ( 60cent boneless wings on thursdays and 60 cent bone in or boneless on Tuesdays) usally a very rowdy crowd but its always fun. Best of all its a 24 hour location."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a little bww in your life! Lol this is the go to place for apps and wings! The street tacos are amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing pisses me off more than bringing a to go order home and it's incomplete. A phone call won't fix it and who wants to drive back once getting home ! So annoyed ."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Do not go here.  Severely disappointing.   Came here with co-workers for some wings and drinks.  The wings were disgusting.  Sauces don't really cover all the wings--can clearly tell the wings are microwaved, and the sauces are drizzled on afterwards.  You can find better wings in the aisle of a local Harris Teeter.  I guess I should've gone with Wild Wing Cafe.  Service was just as bad.  We got seated in an area and had to wait a literal 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us.  At that point, I had to personally ask to get us a server.  Otherwise, I'm pretty sure we would have sat there all evening.  She didn't mess up any orders, but didn't know what to do.  We order drinks, she tries to put the order in, but realizes she needs our IDs.  We don't get any napkins/utensils until requested.  Just stuff like that.  Oh yeah, bring your own carrots and celery--despite what the menu says, the wings do not come with it.  These pictures on Yelp! are deceiving.  (AGAIN, DO NOT COME HERE).  dmo out"}
{"text":"There was a feather in with the seasoning on my traditional wings and when i pointed it out to the dude he said, \"Oh yeah that happens sometimes, one lady totally freaked out about it. At least you know they're real!\"   I mean, they were bone in. I wasn't questioning the legitimacy of the wings, i was questioning the feather that got fried up with them. He also didn't refill my water and it was empty for most of the time. Pretty crap experience all around."}
{"text":"I went here to watch a Monday night football game to get some wings and appetizers. The wings their famous for were tiny, the queso and chips we sent back because I can get better queso in a jar at a grocery store. The nachos were so bad that I had to force myself to eat more each time because I was hungry, the cheese sticks and marinara weren't worth taking a second bite of (and I love cheesesticks anywhere else I've been). The boneless wings had too much tooth breaking crunchy batter with too little hot sauce that only covered parts of this awful crunch. The only good thing was the onion rings, ranch dressing, and many giant tvs to watch the game, but even the uncomfortable wooden stools made me never want to go back here!  If you have very low standards for what you consider is good food then eating here is just fine."}
{"text":"Worst service!!!! We were seated right away but once we got our table nobody even stop by to ask us if we want a drink for 15 minutes. The servers were just passing by and it felt like we were being ignored. I had to go to the front to ask the host that we are ready to order. So don't go to this location, a bunch of lazy employees that doesn't know the value of customer service."}
{"text":"We came here after the Lion King on a Saturday night at 11 pm. First time. Anyhow, at 11pm there was a huge crowd with lots of TVs surrounding the whole place. Every imaginable game on TV.   It took awhile for our waitress to come to our table because they were so busy but once she came the service was really good. Taking our drink & dinner order. I was thinking about a burger and then realized where I'm at. It's Wild Wings so what are they known for wings. So many selections for the wings sauce. I ordered the boneless wings with Honey BBQ and Chipotle BBQ wet with Ranch. Really good. Crispy and not over cooked with a nice sauce. My daughter got wings with Honey BBQ and Asian Zing.  I tried the Asian Zing and really loved them. Really good sauce. Not to hot but good.   My wife ordered the Asian Zing salad and we both warned her that it's a little spicy. She ate a little bite and enjoyed it but then it got too spicy for her. We asked the waitress and told her that it was too spicy for her and asked if she a get a chicken salad instead. No issues. The waitress replaced it for no charge. Very cool. The chicken salad was pretty good and not spicy at all.   People were coming in and out the whole time we were there and still coming in after midnight. Very popular place. I enjoyed the meal. Lots of energy in the place."}
{"text":"I come here often only when my family comes to town. Each time it's not always 5 stars barley even 4. This time around was just the last straw. Our food took forever, longer than usual. And when we asked if someone could check on our order the manager gave us a face of disgust as if we told her to go f herself. Immediately the food came out and of course not hot nor warm. I got the snack boneless once I got to the last piece I found a hair (f me right?!) oh well. Just not coming here again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I love the wings!! Every time I go it's really not busy but my food always takes so long to come out. I can't understand why you're waiting 30 minutes for 12 wings when it's not busy. They definitely need to work on the timing. The staff is friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here after I got off of work, and didn't realize we had gotten there 20 mins before closing, nor would we have realized if is wasn't for me googling it. Our waitress (Summer) was the sweetest, had the biggest smile and was the most attentive. Our drinks were never empty, and she was just the greatest. I am more than satisfied!"}
{"text":"I love the wings, just hate the service. Called in an order of large traditional wings and some buffalo chips. They said 20 minutes when I call at 6:00pmish. I arrived around 6:30pmish and paid for the order and waited, actually expected to wait because it looked like they were busy. Well, about 45 minutes later I still was waiting. Finally asked the staff for the second time about my order and this lady actually found it sitting in their warmer...for awhile. WHAT?!?!  She was nice and apologized and said they had some people helping that didn't know what they were doing. On the plus side, she offered for me to speak to a manager, but I asked her I wasn't going to wait more than 5 minutes to speak to someone.   Guess what? Yep, I left after five minutes without speaking to the manager and she kept on saying sorry. Didn't even offer a coupon, order of wings, etc... In fact, they didn't ask if I was apart of the rewards program which I forgot to mention when I checked out.  Just frustrated with stores operations...I can never seem to get the food in a timely manner even if I'm eating in the restaurant or bar area. I could have probably driven down the street to another B-Dubs got my food and been back home in the same amount of time if not shorter than ordering from here.  If you are coming here to eat or pick-up food, then PLEASE plan on waiting!!!   Please look at making this store a bit more efficient!!!"}
{"text":"This place always takes forever for no reason, happens every time. It's the only location towards northwest area so I still do come here. It's just the service really do suck."}
{"text":"Slow service, cold food, not what a restaurant should be attached to the hall of fame. Wait staff doesn't pay attention to orders, got the wrong beer 3x and food was cold."}
{"text":"They are so nice and attentive here.  I like wings, beers, food, and good company.  So I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"The biggest turn off to this location was the cleanliness of the restaurant. The booth seats were cracked Beyond repair- they really need to be replaced. The tables were chipped and sticky and the Menu Pages stuck together. The silverware and glasses were dingy as well. The floor in the bathroom stuck to the bottom of my shoes... yuk! Also the service was slow and they no longer do bone-in wing night specials on Tuesdays which was the only reason we came! Oh well there are a lot of better places to get wings."}
{"text":"Hands down best location and great customer service!!! Heather was amazing. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Their sauces are excellent but the wings are often very fatty. Mozzarella sticks are really good. Lots of TVs to watch any sport you want."}
{"text":"I really like this place but I called but accidentally called the other place not knowing about it then I went up to this girl at the front told my name she said that they were about to wrap it i dont mind it until 20 mins later I went up the other girl told me that it was ordered to other place and im like wtheck how come the first girl didn't told me so im waiting another 20 mins since. I put in another order coz I guess I'm here but seriously wtheck I was on hold for 15 mins on the phone even tho its another place that's my fault but waiting 40 mins for my order .. it would've been understandable if the other girl told me that it was replace to another BWW smh ugh .."}
{"text":"1 star throughout.... Overall priced , poor quality , poor execution , poor service. On this occasion I got to go food and it was practically inedible. When I do eat inside it's sllooowww service, with a slight improvement to the quality.   I used to work here and I know morale isn't the best, you can kind of sense that no one wants to be there. 700+ stores don't think bbw is going anywhere , I'll ist have to steer clear."}
{"text":"Horrible service with a particular server in the bar area.  She was confrontational and very rude/condescending. Never coming back here ---"}
{"text":"I decided to order wings for pick up on Super Bowl Sunday. I know... probably the absolute busiest day of the year for Buffalo Wild Wings.  I placed my order on the website at 5:04pm and it quoted me a pick up time of 6:40pm.  Normally I would say 90 mins is a bit absurd for pick up, but again, super bowl Sunday.  When I went to pick up the food, it was room temperature cold.  The ticket on my bag said that I was made at 5:14pm, essentially sitting out there for one hour.  They also had the \"Your Order Was Reviewed By\" sticker with the checkboxes and of course none of that was filled out.    They did ask for my phone number and email address when I ordered online, so they could have at least called and said that the online wait time was over an hour off... or at least cooked my food at the appropriate time so that it's not sitting out there."}
{"text":"Good Wings, Cold Beer and Sports, I love this place!   They also play the UFC fights for FREE, thumbs Up I definitely recommend for a night out with the Boys or to watch the fights!"}
{"text":"Took a group here after a movie event I put together. We called ahead so they were expecting us. It was a packed night, as game 7 of the NBA Finals was on.  Took awhile to be greeted by the host - wondered where they were.  Got seated with my friends and was greeted by a very pleasant and personable server.  Our wings took too long to come out. Timed it about 13 minutes from the time I placed the order. Not sure if that was typical, but seemed too long. Once they did arrive they were a welcome treat, very tasty, loved the meat and the sauce.  Took the fudge cake to go, and enjoyed that as well, but only slightly above average.  The bill was fair for what we got in exchange. There is value here and I'm sure that I'll be back. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Sitting in bar area waiting on 6 wings. Its been an hour and they are 20% full. Took us 20 minutes to get drinks, too. Will never be back."}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wild Wings but apparently they have stopped doing specials on traditional wings. Very disappointing because I've been ordering from there for 10+ years. The manager was friendly and explained to me there is a wing shortage or something. So on tues and thur there is only boneless."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Everyone was so friendly. Our waiter was literally the best. Food came out pretty quick. Drinks were always full. He checked on us often. He even helped me with putting the baby on the sling and greeted her.  I wish I would have gotten his name, but what really topped it off was, We visited for my Nephew's birthday ( its his favorite spot). We asked if they did anything special for their guest for their birthday such as sing Happy Birthday. He said No but that they could do something if we wanted. We didn't want them to have to do it if it wasn't normally done, so we passed. BUT! He gathered a few more of his fellow waiters and had them sing for him anyway. That  was the coolest thing. Thank you Buffalo Wild Wings we sure will be back and will definitely recommend this location over any other ones. Until next time!  Updated: Our waiter's name was Marc Anthony."}
{"text":"Today I had the worst experience I placed my Order at 8:42pm the girl that took my order stated your FOOD should be ready in 15min .when I got to the restaurant it was 9:10pm my food was not ready I had to wait another 20min . 20 min passed and finally one lady put out the food in the counter it set there another 5 min so I didn't get my food until around 9:35pm I've always come to this bww but last couple times I placed my orders for pick I had the worst WORST COSTUMER SERVICE ever they need to train their front staff better or idk but I don't think I'll come back and I've been coming to this BwW for like 4yrs + N I LOVE THEIR  WINGS  the food is great but staff needs to have sense of urgency!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I thought the one in westgate was bad this one took the cake waited about 40 min to get our food,wings came out really dry asked for extra sauce, but the sauces came after all the food was eaten.  Really wanted to give you guys another chance but you failed me to many times Won't ever give you my business again  Food is trash too"}
{"text":"Daoning was awesome!! In training and one of the best servers I've had here and elsewhere.  Always great food too!"}
{"text":"Wow was the food fast to order and to come out!!! Service was nice and very quick for our needs. Even though it was a busy Saturday night, the service made it worth it to eat there!"}
{"text":"I WANT to like this place, I LOVE chicken fingers, but  I always leave here with my taste buds drowning in sauce.  They coat the Boneless Wings in enough salty, vinegary, goo that the last visit I resorted to rubbing the chicken with my napkin, and still couldn't taste anything but tang.  The drinks are good, but no refills on anything but soda, and the wilder flavors of lemonade aren't available to taste, and the waitress told me if I didn't like it I would have to purchase a new one! Whaaaa? Seriously?  The nachos would have been good, the meat was tasty, except they were covered in so much lettuce we literally didn't know there was cheese on them til the last two! My first bite had gristle in it, and the flavor was exactly like Middle School cafeteria tacos.  Service is speedy enough, if blasé. I'm sure we'll be there again, because my dream of chicken fingers for lunch blinds me to the fact that I've never left here full."}
{"text":"I've eaten here beforeand typically I get the same thing. Never been dissatisfied in doing so. Figured I'd try something different. I ordered the southwest Philly. Based off the picture it looked delicious. I asked for it with light queso in which they did. And I got buffalo chips on the side. Upon picking it up the waiter opened up the box for me to see and it looked satisfactory, small, but satisfactory. The sandwich was quite tasty, but for what it cost, it left much to be desired. I guess I should have gone with what I knew."}
{"text":"For about a year I have been a regular on Tuesday nights for their traditional wing special (where I would have rated this place a 4 maybe 5 stars.) Even though they kept changing their prices, wing count, and specials, I still remained a loyal customer every Tuesday night. Their latest change of going to the boneless chicken wings special on Tuesday nights was one of the worst meals I have ever had. A small less than 1/2 bite-size piece of chicken that was loaded with breading was NOT what I was looking for or expecting. I could have had a better meal at McDonalds and saved 30.00. This latest change will end my Tuesday night outing over there. It's really too bad they changed this. If you visit, my advice is to order traditional, pay the extra money and ask for Mercedes as your waitress, she is an outstanding server who me and my wife will miss."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I planned to watch the MMA fight they advertised for months on end. After already having one horrible experience we decided to give it another try. We went in got seated on the top floor which was okay. We asked the manager to turn on the free MMA pre-fights before the main event and he lied straight to our faces and told us the entire thing was canceled which was a lie. Then 5 minutes later turned it on for the table next to us. After 15 minutes our waitress finally comes by and gets our drink order which were all soft drinks, and 10 minutes later we got our drinks. She said she would be back soon to get our food order. She came back another 20 minutes later when we all had empty drinks and we ordered our food and asked for new drinks. She had another waiter get our drinks 15 minutes later. 30 minutes after that we finally got our food which was just appetizers and they weren't very good. The main event finally came around that was supposedly 'canceled' and it definitely wasn't after we called our friends who were watching it and looked it up. They turned to the channel and they just didn't want to pay for it. After not seeing our original waitress the entire time we were there except the first 2 times I gave our tip to the other waitress who actually waited on us. Both expierences I left a note on the back of our reciepts giving tips for better service experiences. After family being in the restaurant industry for over 25 years i know the difference between a new server and a server who just simply doesn't care."}
{"text":"Been few times . Service was ok but food is so so. I really don't understand how they screw up chicken wings lol. It's pretty pricey also. Most likely won't be back unfortunately cause I love chicken wings and love not too far away."}
{"text":"Sat down at the bar at 6:20 and ordered 9 traditional wings with fries. Walked out at 6:55 because order never came. Bartender was very nice and understanding. Did not charge me for he half soda I drank waiting 35 minutes for a very basic order. Only reason place gets two stars is because of her. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Man, this place was the bomb. Can you say Mango Habanero!, These are one of the hottest ones but damn are they delicious. Me and my brothers went there. We ordered 4 different kinds (they have 14 flavors). We got Caribbean Jerk, Hot, Asian Zing, and Mango Habanero. We all loved the Asian Zing also. The Caribbean Jerk were ok, kinda had a after taste. The Hot were also ok, nothing special but still delicious. Please if you like to drink up and watch sports this is the place. A bunch of big screens all over the walls. Oh yeah they also serve ribs, hamburgers, sandwiches, breast bites, etc. Just go and let me know. Peace"}
{"text":"Lee our waitress was extremely patient and attentive with our table.  This review goes out to her! Best bdub experience so far! Thanks Lee"}
{"text":"Do not go to this location. Today was the first time in about a year that i have eaten Buffalo Wild Wings. The last time I had this place there were still feathers on my bone in chicken wings. I get it its chicken and it may happen but they should hold them selves to a higher standard and make sure their chicken is clean. So today i finally decided id give them another shot. I regret it. I ordered boneless wings they look so old i bit into a piece of chicken it tasted so bad. Like old microwaved chicken. So with this and my last experiences its safe to say ill never eat Buffalo Wings Ago. I called manager James the absolute no customer service skills. I work in the service industry and would never ask a guest what would you like me to do for you? You always make it better."}
{"text":"After being seated for 10 minutes the waiter finally took our drink order. After taking orders from tables that arrived after us. Waited another 10 minutes and 3 other tables received their drinks and the waiter still had no idea why we didn't have drinks. Instead of going to the bar and getting the drinks he was standing by the order register talking. We finally just got up and left. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I guess they decided to give me the tic tac size wings, and the small size was hard to make sure they got my wing sauce on because there was hardly any. Service is always eh at this location."}
{"text":"Husband and I went there for lunch and the  service was great. The boneless wings tasted old and weird. We got parmesan, honey BBQ, mild and teriyaki wings and not one tasted good."}
{"text":"It was ok, I feel that it needs a little reorganization so that when hot food is ready to come out there is someone on the pass taking it out instead of waiting on a duress-ed server to get it and take care of the many other tables they were dealing with at the same time. The building is not as large as most BWW's so I guess thats why most people are not happy with wait times there."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Service was awful. Waited almost 20 minutes for the check. We all sat at our table staring at the wait staff and no one bothered to come over. Some of the food was a little cold and the nachos we got with the platter were pathetic."}
{"text":"Oh how I crave spicy garlic wings"}
{"text":"Just wanted to say the food and atmosphere is great, but the staff need more knowledge on the menu and could be more helpful when you ask basic questions.. But I still would go back :)"}
{"text":"I was told to leave because I was too tall. The managers Ralph and John told me that I had to leave the bar area because I was too tall and was blocking the view of the television for some other patrons during a UFC fight. I'm 6'5\", There are 19 other TV's showing the same thing when the fight is on, but me standing at the bar waiting for the bartender to serve me my beer is wrong. The manager told me to get \"My Big Cracker Ass\" out of the bar area before he kicked me out which he eventually did. The manager's name is John Dixon and the other manger would not give me his name but I overheard his first name is Ralph. Worst experience ever. I used to go to BW3 quite often. Never again, apparently white people are not welcome."}
{"text":"I waited a while to leave a review about a recent experience at this establishment because I really didn't want to leave a negative review but almost two months later I am still deeply angry and hurt at our treatment . It was august 6 and it was a friends 21st birthday and he just turned 21 so a couple other friends and I decided to stop by after clubbing to get a late night snack. We were the largest table there with 8 people but It took 20 mins to get someone to ask for our drinks. It was 3 in the morning and we understand that there's probably only one server and cook. But there was only 3 other tables other than us. I don't know if it was because we were the youngest group or if it was because we were the only ones not white but it took over an hour to get our food. No one came to let us know what was going on. When we finally got our food we were already sober from the drinks from the club and the cook kept insisting that it didn't take an hour for the food to come out. The people who came after us got their food first!!! Two whole tables! We didn't want the food anymore we were so angry. By the time we walked out the sun was coming out already.  The server obviously forgot to put our orders in but admit to it! Don't tell us after that another coworker called in and try to give us 10% off our bill. The entire time we were waiting he never came by to ask us how we were doing but he was talking to people at the bar and the other tables. Just standing there. I felt discriminated. I will never set foot in a Buffalo Wild Wings again ever. It just left a bitter taste in my mouth from this atrocious experience. I have not had a restaurant completely ignore me or my friends because we weren't white. Disgusted."}
{"text":"Music is so loud amp is clipping. Not that the kids running the place would understand that. Restrooms were nasty and servers would touch trash one minute then get lemons off the bar the next."}
{"text":"Came in and noticed the audio was so loud we could hardly here the hostess. She was nice enough to give us a seat in a quitter area. Even there we struggled to hear the server standing at the end of our table, before you think I am hard of hearing we are in our early 40s with perfect hearing. Service was very good, Arianna took great care of us. Food was good as expected. Would have given 5 if I could hear myself think!"}
{"text":"I think that the best things about this BW3's is that location, how clean and bright the dining rooms are and all of the TVs.  Location wise, it does not get much more central then this.  Nestled in between some other local favorite places and two sports arenas makes it the perfect place to grab drinks/food before, during or after a game, while also checking out some other fun bars in the same night.  The place is very clean and has tons of TV for your viewing pleasure.  It is very brightly lit and has a large bar area.  The food is what you would expect of any BW3's restaurant.  I really enjoy their boneless garlic Parmesan wings and fried pickles.  Their garlic parm sauce is probably my favorite of any wing sauce.  The prices are good and they almost always have a drink/beer or the month that may be a little cheaper then normal.  I was pretty excited when they put this place downtown and love to come on Thursday for boneless wing night or Tuesday for normal wing night."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Disrespectful waitress, and hour and a half wait (and the place was empty) and we got our wings they were cold. Never going to this location again"}
{"text":"I came in with my husband on a Wednesday night because my dad gave me a gift card for my birthday. I'd never been to this location and hadn't eaten at BWW in over 6 years but was ready to try it out! We were greeted after a minute or two by our hostess and seated immediately. We had no idea how huge the restaurant was until we got inside, the outside is deceiving! Our waitress took our drink orders soon after we sat down and was friendly. She didn't know the first thing about what was on the drink menu, but tried her best. My husband is a fan of local beer and she had no idea what was on draft. Probably because they were pretty much out of everything. Like really, practically everything. Our food came out and my order was wrong. After seeing how much sauce was on the incorrect order, I should've cancelled it altogether and tried something else but I didn't. She brought out my teriyaki and they had \"too much sauce,\" and not in a good way. The best thing about our experience was the chili con queso dip. I should've ordered a second serving to go! Overall we weren't impressed. The dip was good but that was it. Oh and the bathroom was pretty clean as well...but the food experience left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Well, we tried to give this Buffalo Wild Wings the benefit of the doubt but they failed. There was an empty table for 15 minutes and we were not seated. I asked how much longer and didn't get an answer. So I decided to Yelp a new place and found Johnny Mac's 5 minutes away. The BEST decision EVER."}
{"text":"Hey it's BWW....like most. It's the go to place for a kickback wings and beer. Good location... Friendly bartenders and food is as it always is."}
{"text":"This overpriced national sports bar chain is super popular because of all of the tvs and is arguably the best place to catch a game. But that's about it. The food and drinks are overpriced. That being said, Tuesdays are traditional wing night (.60 cents) and Thursdays are boneless wing nights."}
{"text":"We were just here and were disappointed with our bar/gambling experience.  Even though we were gambling for over 2 hours, we were charged for every drink we ordered.  We will go elsewhere for now on."}
{"text":"Your a average BWW. The cool part was that it was connected to the nascar hall of fame museum. You can also sit outside and enjoy the city views while eating."}
{"text":"I order take out I was told 10 min showed up in 10.  Had wait additional 30. It's not hard to give a realistic time too long of Wait for take out."}
{"text":"I just moved to Monona so I've started going to this Bdubs instead of the one on the east side. However, after the service I've experienced today, I will be hesitant to return. My party was seated at a booth next to other patrons. The restaurant was slow so we were quick to figure out our orders. After 15 minutes of waiting for service and having many servers pass us multiple times, we decided to leave and come to the one on the east side. It was twice as busy but we still got service immediately. Service at this location has been slow but I have never had this bad of an experience until today."}
{"text":"The pickled wilies I agree are not good.  The mozzarella sticks are good.  The chicken tenders salad is pretty good here."}
{"text":"Like the wings here but I really did not like the service at all... our server didn't check up us hardly at all, my food came out about 10 minutes after my boyfriend got his food... another waitress had to bring my food out bc my waiter forgot it!! If it wasn't for the service I would give this locations more stars..."}
{"text":"They are the same pretty much everywhere you go, but that's not a bad thing. Lots of beers, decent food, and always a great place to watch some football."}
{"text":"I have never had great experience with it's take out. But dinning in has always been amazing! Best wings ever. I love the gyro and garden crasher they have!"}
{"text":"I am so glad they reopened the location in north Scottsdale a year or so ago. They worked out some kinks and its a great atmosphere and super nice employees.   At times they get a little behind with seemingly small volume however this is a great family atmosphere. They do not play any UFC or boxing from my understanding so you may want to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Count your wings before you leave. We were missing four wings and Jon (the supervisor) said, \"do you want me to credit the card back or do you want to drive back to get more wings.\" Couldn't credit back the gift card so said can have a credit if we want to come back for a snack size wing. Need to work on customer service skills. (Megan and Jon)  Doesn't seem like business is wanted. Plenty more places to get over priced wings in the area"}
{"text":"Came to this location expecting it to be like every other location. Starla was nice as far as people in Vegas go. The waitress who brought our food spilled water all over my pregnant wife when bringing our food out. We are not the type to make a stink but when we got our food it was also cold, So naturally we brought it to Starla's attention.   She was nice and said she would have it removed from the bill but when the manager walked by she gave us a dirty look.   After the water incident and the cold food we didn't feel like it was a huge deal for those items to be removed. Over all the service was worth  2 stars."}
{"text":"Great service and great wings. From Buffalo so I'm sort of picky about my wings. They were big and cooked to the perfect crispness. Sauces were great and the bartender let me try a few different sauces (with some free fries for dipping) before I picked the right one. For wings, this place can't be beat."}
{"text":"The food is standard BWW fare and service is usually pretty decent. But the volume of the music is so loud that it's hard to talk to anyone. And I don't mean when there is a game and it's busy, of course I expect it to be loud. No big deal. But, when there aren't any games on and the restaurant is half empty we don't need the volume up SO LOUD that it is literally uncomfortable for my ears. Nobody is coming here for the music. If anyone from BWW is reading this PLEASE TURN IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT!!!!!! Two stars for my two poor ears."}
{"text":"Slow service! We visited Monday January 8, 2018 around 7:00 p.m. We sat at the bar and we quickly received our beers. However when we tried ordering food, we never got service. We then moved to the regular seating area after talking to the host, and it took forever for our server to arrive. When we asked questions about the menu, the server didn't seem very polite. We watched the game \"Georgia vs Alabama\" for over 2 hours, and we never got asked if we needed a refill or any extra drinks. Not until I asked for a to-go box I was asked if I needed a drink. The server hardly ever walked around us or the surrounding tables within that 2 hour period. I hadn't visited BWW in over two years, and I feel like now I'll never go back after this experience. Food was good but the place is overrated and has bad service. Avoid this location at all cost."}
{"text":"Really stupid that they wud charge 99c to substitute fries for a small side salad !!!! That's y everyone's becoming fat lol"}
{"text":"I am an official Buffalo Wild Wings Blazin' Challenge Winner! And i do that everytime I get bored. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and food is delicious but service is SLOW. We were warned by a friend and didn't listen. It took 45 minutes to get our food after ordering and the dining room wasn't even 1/3 of the way full. I'd advise avoiding if you're on a time schedule and (if you still feel like testing the waters) asking for your check upon receiving your food."}
{"text":"Came here last night starving after a concert! Unfortunately we were seated in the worst possible spot...Brianna's section. Yeah the little ugly purple bald headed confused thang they've got working there! We ordered Naked Tenders and Cheese Fries at 10:50pm. At 12:08am Brianna finally came in our area where I called her over to ask why we were still waiting. She went to check on our order after running 4 different drink orders and cleaning 2 tables. She brought her rude, unprofessional purple headed ass back with Breaded Fried Tenders and stated, \"They messed up your order by giving you breaded tenders instead of naked. So just eat these for now until your order is corrected\". At that point I asked well where are the cheese fries? She huffed and puffed throwing her hands in the air as she stormed away from our table saying I'll just get my manager! Wooh! Thank God for my past anger management classes! As long as you've got trashy tackles rude unprofessional teeny boppers working here I will NEVER come back! That Brianna's a real LOSER!!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night around 6:30 and was seated right away as a party of two. Both our food and drinks came out promptly, and our server was very attentive and checked in often. She was really sweet, and I wish I caught her name, but it was really the great service that made this a 5 star experience. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"So my coworker and I came into this locations to get a quick bite to eat. We opted to sit at the bar. There's no space to eat.  I wasn't really moved by the menu, so annoyed I just got a chicken sandwich. When I did get it, I bit down and my chicken wasn't cooked. It was disgusting.  I returned it and was told I would get a new one. I stayed for at least 40 minutes in a less than busy restaurant to wait for my 2nd sandwich.  I wasn't compensated, or anything. I'd never eat at this chai  after this."}
{"text":"Good wings but make sure to ask for sauced wings or you get the dry-rub and it is cough inducing if your not ready for it.   Service was good but slow since we ordered wings and it wasn't very crowded and this is the main item they serve!!  Parking lot and outdoor seating. Great location, right off 74 in Matthews."}
{"text":"If I can make a suggestion, with your tacos, don't be afraid to serve them hot. Don't be lazy or afraid. The food in the tortillas is warm or hot, don't serve it in a cold tortilla right out of the fridge. Also the sauce on the tacos was cold. Why are you serving cold sauce on hot food? Heat up your tortillas and condiments or at least have them at room temp. Veggie condiments can be cold, but not sauce condiments. Go that extra mile. We can do it."}
{"text":"My dad wanted to stop in, being that he had never eaten at a BW2. The food was decent and reasonably priced. The service was great, but it is far too noisy for conversation if you aren't here to watch a game. Fun hangout for sports, friends, and simple appetizers, however. Worth a stop, if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I gave it 4 stars, because I really do like the atmosphere. I feel the food is a tad on the pricier side, but I never had an issue with service or bad food. One time I ordered something and they brought me something different, it was quickly fixed no question asked. The place is a heaven for a sports fan. Plenty of TVs, good atmosphere.    Been there 5-6 times, will come back sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"I placed a order online. I went in and it was extremely slow when I walked in.   I order 15 wings and mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks when I open it the sauce didn't have a lid and was all over the box (I posted a photo). The mozzarella sticks were cold and soaked. The wings there was only 9 (also posted a photo) I also asked for extra wet. It wasn't extra wet.   I called to talk to the manager , he placed me on hold to \"reprint the receipt\" acted like I was making up the fact I just came in there and got terrible food. I even tip the girl at the pick up $4 because she was nice and the place was so empty.   Restaurant is only as good as the product and service they deliver and this was a epic fail. I won't recommend anyone go to this location.   This is the first Buffalo Wild Wings I have been to (we have wing Thursday's at my work every Thursday for the past year) that I have ever been treated so poorly and had such terrible food."}
{"text":"Love it here on Saturday for lunch and a bit of sports! Wings are delicious... just cant beat the great atmosphere. Location doesnt hurt either :)  Happy Hour prices are really great, and the service is great. Food delicious. Best thing is not only are they accomodating to big groups but there is no bad place to sit in this place- great to watch any sporting event."}
{"text":"Love other locations, this one-NOT SO MUCH.  Took FOREVER for our server to ask us for a drink order. The table was dirty when we arrived, although more than 75% of the bar was empty at the time.   Our drinks finally arrive via someone other than our original server(who was MIA for at least a good 5 mins or more), we were finished and waiting for our server to get back to ask for our tab!  Horrible service, and truly disappointed about that since we absolutely love  Buffalo Wild Wings in general."}
{"text":"Bartender Ray gets 5 stars! Sometimes it's the servers that makes you want to return to a restaurant and in this case it is undoubtably Ray at the bar! He is amazing. Not only is he charming but so knowledgeable about the food and drink items\" he helps everyone make good choices and since there are many wing sauce choices....this way no one is disappointed. He is worth his weight in gold.Hope they are paying him well!  Wings were really good...drinks excellent. Flatbread would not order again..but that was my choice...NOT Rays"}
{"text":"Well, I LOVE BWW. I have for years. I have many memories with friends ever since college going to have wings and drinks at BWW.  I have been four times in a row with a less than a satisfactory experience. NEVER due to service.  The service has been on point.  The 2 star is for the wings. Change your distributor for goodness sake. Maybe you saved a couple bucks, but I'm tired of getting the deformed reject leftovers that Walmart doesn't want.  Seasoning is always the same; love it. But, when the wings suck at Buffalo Wild WINGS, you get a 2... barely. I like 1.5."}
{"text":"As much as I love wings I should have stuck with wing stop.   The service was awful.  The waitress never checked in with me and my wings were very bland.  More then likely I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"After a private party at Commonwealth, my best friend and I decided to come down to BWW for some grub to soak up the alcohol.  This location is open all night and centrally located in the same parking lot as the Las Vegas Outlet center.    Definitely your standard BWW.  The front part of the restaurant is a dinning room for families.  The back part is a huge bar, decorated with lots of big screen TVs for game watching.  Along side the bar are bar top tables, which we decided to sit at.  Our server was also the bartender and pleasant to work with.   I slipped him my card at the beginning so I could pay for the meal and he caught the hint, took the card from under the table and did a great job keeping it a secret from my bestie.    For our meal, we started with the Mozzarella sticks for $6.49 and mini corn dogs for $5.79.  The mozzarella sticks crispy and perfectly breaded on the outside, and gooey mozzarella goodness on the inside.  The marinara dipping sauce made the stick taste like a good cheese pizza!  The corn dogs were literally bite sized hush puppy goodness.  The corn bread batter wasn't overpowering the dog.  There was a dipping sauce for this as well, mustard I think.  It made the corn dogs delicious!  I also decided to get the small boneless wings containing 10 boneless wings.  Parmesan Garlic was my flavor choice.  I liked the wing.  It was battered and super crunchy.  The Parmesan Garlic, on the other hand, was not as good as the actual wing.  It was too tangy and super salty.  It seemed like the wing was drenched in that sauce and very overpowering.  I was not a fan, to be honest.    Football season is coming up, so you know I'll be at BWW at least couple more times during the season.  I love the service, I love the food, maybe just a different choice of sauce upon my return.  Love the central location and that means a bright future for me and BWW!"}
{"text":"Horrible service at the bar area, after my group and the on behind us waited for over 15mins.. I had to get up and ask for menus and a server.  After 20 more mins we didn't get our drink order or appetizers. But the table in front of us got two rounds of drinks. Being a sports bar, we expected to see the woman's World Cup... Out of over 40 plus screens .. Not one had the World Cup. What a shame, female sports should count too..we were going to ask to have them change a channel on at least a small screen in the corner, but after 45 mins of waiting and no food, we were ready to just leave."}
{"text":"We came to BWW last night to watch the most disappointing game in Packers history.  Trust me, that's another story and something that's too hard for me to revisit LOL.  I like this location.  It's on a busy, high traffic area, however, lots of space.  BWW does a great job separating the dining area versus the bar area.  I usually go there for the beer and games because the bar has huge projector screen TVs.  Great clarity and everywhere, so you're not missing anything!  From 5-7pm, they have a great happy hour.  Domestic draft beers in a tall (I think it's either 18 or 24 ounces) for only $3.  Great deal.  Their happy hour also includes food, but I'm never in the mood for that.  Drinks only for me!  If you're ever thinking about a convenience venue for the game, come down and check this place out."}
{"text":"Oh gosh, it was clearly after 1:00am when my roommate suggested we go to BWW for a late night snack.  I was actually starving and agreed, even though I had an 8:00am meeting.    The great thing is that all BWWs are very consistent.  When you enter, you see the restaurant dining area for folks who prefer a non bar scene.  Keep in mind, this place closes after hours.  In the back is the bar area.  The bar takes up a lot of the space, obviously being the focal point of the area.  The bar area is filled with round bar stools, big screen TVs for the game and sports memorabilia.  The bartender was the only server on duty at the time.  He was nice, however, it took soooo long to place our order or get our check.  It was to the point that we would just stare at him until he came around.  Granted, there were three other parties in there at the moment, but c'mon.  I was a little turned off by that.    For starters, we got the cheese curds for $5.19.  Battered and fried cheddar curds served with a yellowish dipping sauce.  The curds were not good at all in my opinion.  The batter seemed stale and it came off as if they sat out for quite some time.  The dipping sauce made it worse.  I couldn't even tell what it was.  Just not good.  For my meal, I got the snack size traditional wings, mild flavor, for $5.99.  You get about 5 wings flavored the way you like it.  The mild sauce was flavorful but a little hot for my taste buds. The blue cheese dipping sauce made it better.  I do appreciate the fact that they made a good wing, I'll give them that.    Although it was after hours, I wasn't that impressed by this location.  It's close to my house, so I know I'll eventually be back.  Hard to say when, though.  In an area filled with restaurants, it's not really standing out as a first choice for me in the future."}
{"text":"I had a lovely weekend with some long lost friends, full of libations, food and good times. On the last day of the weekend, we decided to finish the weekend off by heading to BWW. It's usually a place that offers a little bit of everything for everyone.    This location is situated in the middle of the largest shopping center of this specific intersection. Not much around the area, however, Horizon's intersection is filled with grocery stores, gas stations, bars and restaurants. For Buffalo Wild Wings, if you've been to a location, you have literally seen them all! The look is exactly the same.  You walk in, you see a hostess stand and a restaurant area for dining and families.  Behind that is the bar area, both areas filled with large screen TV's for every game going on at anytime. This is definitely your quintessential sports restaurant and bar. On this visit, we decided to sit in the dining area. Our server was Phillip and I thought he did an excellent job! He was nice and very efficient.  We asked him for a few requests during our visit and he was nice enough to get us what we needed an in record time.   For dinner, I decided to \"Build my own burger\" starting at $8.99. For my burger, nothing special, I started with the beefy burger, added tomatoes, lettuces, red onions and pepper jack cheese. This meal was served with fries. I was confused to find out that they do not ask what temperature you want your burger at. When the burger came, I realized it's because the burger is not a fresh patty, just a pre-frozen burger. Not a big deal, but I'm sure glad I ordered the pepper jack cheese as the bun and burger had little to no flavor. Keep in mind that you will probably have to ask for condiments like ketchup or mayo to add to this burger. The patty was a think patty, lettuce was shredded iceberg and the fries were natural cut and became the star of my dinner. Very, crispy and tasty!  Overall, I wasn't completely impressed by my meal, however, I spent less than $10 for this dinner, so no complaints. Ending the wonderful weekend with this meal was not the best but I'm not opposed coming back at all.  BWW is a place that will always have a place in my heart!"}
{"text":"My husband and I didn't have such a great experience here.  Maybe its because they are a newer location and they are still getting the kinks out.  We got there and didn't get to order drinks until we ordered our food, which was quite a while.  My husband had ordered a Pepsi and when it came, it was pure sugar (totally gross).  The waitress was nice enough to allow him to change drinks because it was so bad.  We ordered an appetizer, but the appetizer came with the food, not before.  I told my husband he should have sent it back, but he wanted to try the fried mushrooms so we kept them.  I got the grilled cheese sandwich with boneless buffalo chicken wings on it.  I am so sorry to say that I didn't really like it.  I really though it would taste good, but it was either the chicken or the cheese that just didn't mesh with the rest of the sandwich.    I had also ordered a side of onion rings in lieu of the fries.  When my food came it came with fries.  When I explained that I had ordered onion rings, the server pulled an order of onion rings off the tray and gave it to me.  Apparently, my waitress ordered my meal with fries and an extra order of onion rings on the side.  I can't complain too much about this though, because she didn't charge me for the fries (which was good because I didn't eat them anyway).    So all in all, the food was sub par and the service was pretty bad.  Mind you the waitress was nice and I really think she had good intentions, but if I am truthful then I have to say that this place pretty much sucks.  I say if you want good food, good drinks, and good service, go to the Winking Lizard or Quaker Steak and Lube."}
{"text":"Have been to bdubs countless times and have had sub par experiences each time. This last time however, was the icing on the crappy cake. Walked into the restaurant at around 7:30 on a Tuesday and was not greeted for a full 5 minutes before deciding to seat ourselves. Our server came to get our drink order and after dropping off the drinks, she went to sit down 3 tables away from us to eat wings of her own with her fellow co workers. As she proceeded to take breaks between bites to serve us, it became more and more disturbing watching her lick her fingers and getting up to serve guests & garnish drinks without washing her hands. She was not the only server doing this. There were a few others at the table eating and on their phones- very unprofessional. To top it all off, we noticed our server was wearing open toed Nike Slide sandals. Overall, this place is run very poorly. If you're looking for wings, I would recommend any place over this one."}
{"text":"way over priced! took our father there for fathers day. around 2pm. ordered a basket of fries thinking we could share it. inferior fries the cheapest kind you find at a grocery store.beers were good but not at $6.50 a drink. wings, horrible! ate 2 of the 10. bill came to $32. should have been $10 for the amount and quality of the food. will not ever go there again. the plus side is there were plenty of waitresses there and they held the doors open for us."}
{"text":"Came for a munchies ...clean, friendly staff.....except the service was slower than slow.  We ordered our drinks and had to ask for them a couple times.  While our waiter was running around trying to get all his tables tended too, one waitress was just standing at a booth chatting away like she had no care in the world."}
{"text":"It's near my house and 24/7 but not somewhere I'd go out of my way for.   I've had the mini corn dogs which were pretty good. I enjoy the buffalo chips which are oval fries and not chips like I originally thought.   Came again on a Thurs. for a snack. It was 60 cent boneless wings night so decided to give it a go. The breading was a bit too crispy for my BF, but it didn't bother me too much. If you let certain ones sit though, it gets significantly soggy/stale in a short amount of time so I would say small batches are best. Favorite sauce so far is the Asian Zing in flavor and it doesn't sog up the tender that much..   Most of the time it's pretty chill here but the last visit it was just kinda janky with all the kids hanging out here and then some started up fights in BWW and I thought a girl fight was gonna happen. When the 11pm kick all under 21 hit, they sat in the parking lot blaring music out of cars to where I can feel our booth vibrating. It was just very odd. Though staff can only do so much, they should at least say something.  It's by my house so I'll be back for late night snacks. I'm curious to try all the different sauces."}
{"text":"Apparently BWW no longer does crispy wings on Tuesday. This is a brand new policy, however no notification was given to their customers. My suggestion is to post a simple sign stating this and to allow a transitionary period to still be able to accommodate guests. As I proceeded to ask the manager, Danny, to make an exception as this was a new policy and we were unaware, he said no. I will add they they were not busy, and the exception could have been made. I called the location on Warm Springs and Durango and they said they'd be happy to accommodate us. Needless to say, I will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Great service, good wings, they keep your drinks coming, and I like country they were playing it the entire time I was there :) don't think that's something they do all the time. I think I just got lucky :) you can't really mess up wings tho unless you over cook them or under cook them. Didn't blow me away but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both times later in the evening.  Their late hours is a bonus for me since I work night shift.  I was seated immediately both times. The food and prices are pretty decent, and the wings were hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I always enjoy making my way down to Bdubs; it's probably one of my favorite places to go eat wings! Naturally, everyone has their favorite flavors, but mine have to be lemon pepper, honey BBQ & hot wings :) sometimes they do end up putting too much spice though..   I don't really recommend any other food here than chicken, alcohol, and flavored fries! The rest is really just sub-par.  They're open 24 hours a day at the bar, and thank god, because all those crazy, sport-loving people need somewhere to watch tv. For the kids (well, and adults too!), they have a quiz game that you can play on your phone or ask for one of their machine thingys.   BWW is always just a really good place to chill and have a beer. Does it have the best food? No. But you can still have a damn good time scarfing good chicken down your throat!"}
{"text":"I was here on March 3rd. My waitress Sarah seemed uninterested in actually having to serve me since half the food and drinks were delivered by other people and it took over 20 minutes for me to get a beer I ordered by her. I went again tonight hoping for another waitress; that didn't work. The manager, I didn't catch his name put my beer order in and brought my cheese curds. I waited for over 20 minutes after receiving the beer I ordered which was unceremoniously dropped off by Sarah, who elected not to say anything or reply to my thank you before I went for a smoke. 15 minutes later after taking 3 other orders and checking on those tables again, I flagged her down for the check. I won't be back.  Disappointing that I regularly eat alone, eat enough for 2 and tip more than 20% everywhere, yet I can't even order food or get it in a reasonable time from here. Left a note about the 30 minute wait time to take an order on the check back..  Waitress should find another job not dependent on service times.."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times before. Needed to use a Christmas gift card so gere we are. We were seated very promptly. Cindy was our waitress. She was very friendly and really knew her menu. Clean restrooms. Appetizers were out quick. Soon after our food came. The southwest Philly is the best Philly I've ever had. The cheese they put on it just makes it percect! I love the buffalo chips with sweet BBQ sauce. This location is my favorite! Will def be Back!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal today. They have this new system on their lunch menus if your order isn't out by the time the timer hits 15 mins you get it for free. Well winner winner chicken dinner. Our meal took about 25 minutes. They gave us drinks and all for free. Doris our waitress goes on my top three best waitresses. She was excellent from start to finish. Very atttentive. We had drank our sodas about half way and she was already out with new sodas. She never missed a beat and was very friendly. She was serving allot of tables. But gave everyone equal amount of her time. We gave her a big tip since we got our meal free. Food was awesome. Very clean restaurant. Will definitely come again. Best Buffalo Wild Wings I've been to so far."}
{"text":"Been here a buncha times, mostly for late nights or Wing Tuesday or Thursdays, when theres wing specials. I believe  the graveyard wing special no longer exists and its $0.60 tues boneless or bone-in now. I remember when I first moved here in '06 and my sister told me about this great wing place that had $0.25 wings on Tuesdays and I love my wings. My eyes literally got big at the thought of it. What followed was I visiting this B-dubs every tuesday and ordering 3 different sauces of 6 wings each. I worked my way down their heat scale from the mild to hot til I tried them all. Did I say I love wings? haha The wing special price has slowly creeped up in the past 7yrs sadly and now is more than double what I originally knew.($0.25 to 0.60) Might not go as often as before due to the happy hour not being as good a deal anymore but I'll still go sometimes. I do try other items on their menu on ocassion but usually I'm there for the wings! My fave sauce has to be the spicy garlic. The fried pickles and their onion rings ain't too shabby either. Service for the most part has been great from the bartenders and waitresses. The few times theres been a problem it was promptly corrected without hesitation. Drinks refilled before the current one is empty. Great place to grab some late night grub since they are open 24hrs."}
{"text":"Another family affair, wings were the order of the night. I usually frequent the Durango or LV Outlet locations. My first visit to a B-Dubs that wasn't one of the two aforementioned, but this was the closest in proximity. I almost felt like I was cheating on my regular wing spots. Entering at first, I thought this particular location was very small. But it was deceptive. The place turned out to be bigger. There is alot of walls separating the various sections of the place. I'm glad to say the food and service was good. Eating with my family, there's usually a few quirks in our ordering. Everything went smoothly. Checked upon often and drinks refilled. It is worth noting they brought back their unlimited wings & fries weekday lunch special for $12.99 for a limited time(Was $11.99 when they last had it year). Their Wing Tuesdays & Boneless Thursdays are now both $0.60/wing. Boneless used to be $0.60 and on Tuesday traditional bone-in $0.45 but they raised the bone-in to match the boneless price. Inflation must be hitting this place pretty hard. Wing Tuesday has gone up from $0.25 to $0.60 since I've lived here in 2006. Even with the rising prices, I will probably still be a regular long as the service stays good. There's no accounting for good service, ever."}
{"text":"I try to go to lunch here at least once a week and I have never had an issue at this location. I am promptly seated and my order is taking when I am ready. I love the salt and vinegar wings and their french fries are some of my favorite fries. My daughter likes it because she gets to play games on their tablets and eat cheesecake bites for desert."}
{"text":"Just finished dining here and literally had the best service from (I believe her name tag said Mazzy, and on our receipt said Makayla).Down to earth, fun to talk to, and had a great recommendations on the best drinks to order! Typically coming in service is okay, but she definitely delivered. Cannot toot this chicks horn enough! Food was quick and everything was great, will be returning for her!"}
{"text":"Beware the extra 60 cents charge for ranch dressing those wings. Not even on the menu. Staff was attentive and food and drink great!"}
{"text":"Amazing food but I have two problems. One is that they are very stingy when it comes to free drinks when I am gambling. Also the general manager was extremely rude when we asked for ranch. She said they were 60 cents or whatever and made me feel like she thought we couldn't afford it. We got 40 wings and we were given 2 ranches. I do not think that asking for more ranches was crazy."}
{"text":"This was my very first time at this location and first time ever watching the fights here. We got there rather early, put our names down and waited about 15 minutes which I thought was pretty good.   The food was good, the service was actually fairly quick considering how busy it was.   We get sat at a 4 person table that was much much shorter than the rest of the tables in the bar area. So it was a bit weird, I felt like I was sitting on the ground in the middle of a bunch of tree's, everyone was just towering over us.   The only problem that I really had was that my friends and I were sat at a four top and two of our friends left and within 30 seconds of them getting up and leaving these two random guys who were sitting on a bench just ran over and sat down with us. I was kind of annoyed by this because we had the table to ourselves and we were eating and watching the fight and the server didn't ask us if we were okay with it or anything. Just kind of went along with it. I realize that we could have easily asked them to not sit at our table but I feel like that shouldn't be on me. If I am eating in your establishment and paying decent money for food and drinks than it shouldn't be my obligation to make sure some random people don't just come sit with us. I was just put off by the entire situation."}
{"text":"So  we originally went there when we first moved to AZ in 2011. They closed shortly after. Since they opened, we've gone at least once a week or two weeks. The first time we went back after they reopened, we walked out because no one came to our table for 10 mins. We decided to give it another try and it was so much better, because we sat in the bar area. Since then, we sit in the bar area every time. This last time we went, last week on a Wednesday, the service was horrible and the food was horrible. The salad I ordered, the lettuce was wilted and the chicken wings I ordered, had barely any sauce on it. I think we'll stick to Booty's, better service and food by far. I have given up on you Buffalo Wild Wings in Surprise, AZ!"}
{"text":"Food was ok.  The service isn't very good.  Sat at the bar, think there was only two people at the bar.  Just took to much time to get refills etc.  the waitress was playing on her personal phone behind the cash register and didn't even look up.  Guess it's hard to find good help these days that actually care about customer service and the experience"}
{"text":"Food was good,  many times its hit or miss at different Buffalo Wild Wings.  Tori was my bartender and she was very attentive.  The manager also walked around and asked how the food was, and he was sincere about it."}
{"text":"Got there 9 p.m. did not see a waitress until about 9:15 she came and apologized that nobody else helped us we weren't even supposed to be helped by her we stopped in for just dessert nachos dessert it still took her 25 minutes to bring it to a so what should it took 15 20 minutes where is the Service took in over an hour by time everything was said and done very bad service food is good it's too bad it's the closest one to us for that s***** service"}
{"text":"Back again on Friday night in the seating side this time wait 5 minutes and got seated server was great fast keep our drinks up will come back again"}
{"text":"We sat out side not bad service we had to tell the waiter couple of Time to bring us stuff that he would forget to bring food came hot and the way we order it one of our better spot for wing just a 30 minute drive for us we go there to meet friends"}
{"text":"This is my first (and probably only) experience at BWW. They looked quite busy when I arrived, so I headed straight to the surprisingly small bar, being a single diner. I waited quite a while to get noticed standing, but will not put timelines here because I didn't realize then it was going to be an issue. I finally caught the attention of a server refilling a water behind the bar, and she brought me to the bartender's attention. He informed me that no one was leaving soon, so I headed back to the host stand. They were accommodating there, informed me there was just one party ahead of me unless I wouldn't mind a tiny table. That was perfect for me but I didn't realize it was an INVISIBLE table. Again I waited for some time but still felt quite forgiving. When Alison arrived she was pleasant enough; asked for a drink order, and instead I put in my entire order, later wishing I had asked for my side salad first. Is this an option servers give diners? And I understand the volume you are doing but I so prefer to give a temperature on my burger. Everything came at once and brought by a different server. She dropped my food and started to leave; very loud in there and I felt badly I had to raise my voice for 'Hey can I get some silverware?'. She looked under that ridiculous amount of napkins that had been left (managers, product cost?) as if I had not seen my roll up. As she went to retrieve one, I realized I had no pepper or mustard. When she dropped my roll up off- I had to get up and follow her to ask for the condiments, which then seemed difficult to find. Finally started on my salad while my burger got cold. Alison DID do a check-back which was impressive, but before I even GOT to my burger she came back and offered dessert? My water was never refilled; I got Alison's attention and gave her my card, and my receipt came with no itemized receipt. No one said goodnight to me on the way out. I would blame this poor service on being so busy, but the entire time I was there I saw plenty of servers milling around."}
{"text":"Their food isnt great. Its okay I guess; its fried. The \"hot\" sauces aren't very hot. Their beer selection is pretty darn good for a chain, though and right now they have Magic Hat #9.  They are next to the movie theater ... if you think it is a good idea to knock a few back before you go to see your next flick, you are wrong. It is a GREAT idea. I LOVE getting a little sloppy before taking in a movie, especially a comedy, and the big 22 oz beers at BW's are great way to get there.  I have taken to going to trivia here on Tuesday nights. There is a multi-round trivia game that starts at 7:30 and goes to 8:30. It is on the blue boxes they give you and is a pretty good mix of stuff, light on sports, heavier on history and geography. It would be awesome, except the servers in the bar area reliably come by to ask complex questions when you are right in the middle of a question. C'mon girls, open your eyes!"}
{"text":"This is just a review of the place for trivia. They have NTN trivia, with a good game that starts at 7:30 and lasts till 8:30 with multiple rounds, categories, and scoring schemes. It features a good mix of questions that become more difficult as the game progresses. If you do not make the maximum points wager at the end of the game on the final question, I do not respect you.  A word of warning, however: if you perform too well at trivia at this location, you may attract the attention of a certain member of MENSA who isn't shy about telling people she is in MENSA (like many MENSA members, I find). She will want you to join MENSA, so you can pay money to hang out with folks like her. What is an anagram for awkward?"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would.   My friend and I came here and we both sat at the bar. She has a Washington ID and they said they couldn't accept her card because it didn't match their book. They just made themselves look SO stupid because we're both servers at a restaurant and she is actually turning 23 next month. Ridiculous. We weren't even going to order alcohol beverages to begin with. Never come back here again. Stupidest Buffalo Wild Wings I've ever went to. No wonder why they have 3 stars."}
{"text":"My hubby had been eager to try the wings here, so we finally got to check this place out!   Service was good - I can't complain.  Our orders were taken promptly and we were checked up on several times!   We got a double order of wings and were given a choice of three flavours. So we decided on the Honey BBQ, Parmesan Garlic and Salt and Pepper dry seasoning. The wings were pretty good - I liked the Honey BBQ best out of all of the flavours. I thought the wings were comparable to other places - nothing really stood out. So while I had a positive experience overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"I come often to this location since it's 5 minutes away from my house. Good service, cold beer, what else do you want on a game night?? It can get crowded sometimes, especially on Sundays when Brownies are playing."}
{"text":"I was in town for a family wedding weekend, staying at a nearby hotel.  This BW's was the only bar in walking distance, so I was here three times in two days (sadly).  The food is the standard BW's fare, but the service was pretty close to awful, and for that, I would recommend you steer clear.  The first visit was for drinks on a Friday night, probably around 10pm.  The experience was ok, except for the server not having the correct list of beers on tap and taking orders only having to come back and tell us that they actually didn't have what we ordered.  They were all seasonals, so I get it (sorta), but this seems like a bar/management issue.  We then visited Saturday afternoon (between ceremony and reception) for some apps and a round of drinks.  This is where things started to go downhill fast.  There were 8 of us, and maybe (MAYBE) half of the tables in the place had customers at like 3:30 in the afternoon.  It took a noticeable amount of time for the server to come and take our drink orders.  Again, the server read us the same draft list we heard the night before.  I tried to order the beer I had the night before and was told they didn't have it, but that they did have one that they were out of not even 24 hours earlier.  Needless to say, the server's list was incorrect and again we had to reorder.  We then ordered some apps.  Among the 8 of us, there were 4 app orders and 1 kids meal.  It took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive.  In that time, we were not offered drink refills and our food only came after we asked our server explaining (again) that we were on a bit of a time crunch.  When our food arrived, there were cups of cheese sauce that had a film on them-you know, the kind that appears when cheese is heated and then sits for awhile.  In conversation, other guests for the same wedding went to BW's for lunch and had a similar experience of waiting over 30 minutes for food.  What does this place do when all the tables are full?!  After the reception, the wedding guests congregated again at BW's so they could easily walk back.  We arrived ahead of the group and were actually able to score some really attentive, quick service.  But then, the larger group arrived, and the experience that really knocked this from 2 stars to 1 star:  the group of 20+ people included probably 12 people in their late 20's and over half of the group was told by the server that she could not serve them alcohol because they appeared intoxicated.  I'm a reasonable person, I can get on board with enforcing a policy for the good of society, etc. but the selective and poor judgement in this situation was appalling.  Yes, we were a large group, yes we were loud and celebratory.  No, we were not drunk.  After review, it seemed that all of the guys in the group were served and the women were not; except for one who, when she received her drink was told that she would only be allowed one beer.  Also, they close at 1am, and it's fair, last call was maybe 12:30/45, but by 1:00, the chairs were on the tables and the lights were up, and they were asking us to leave.  Because of the captive audience from the two hotels close by, it seems this place seems has no incentive to improve service and doesn't need to rely on a loyal customer base."}
{"text":"Good wings!   But really slow service.........You can play a game of trivia with the other restaurant patrons to keep your hunger at bay..."}
{"text":"I didn't realize Buffalo Wild Wing was different than Wild Wings but here we are! I came here for lunch during the week so needless to say it was pretty empty.  We had the chips and salsa to start (good amount, we had 3 people and all of us had a decent portion). I got the small boneless wings and fries which was around $11.99...which is actually a good price for this considering their regular dinner menu has the same minus the fries for around the same price! I got honey garlic flavour and the wings were well cooked and a good size. I got 8 wings with the Small, the other option was Snack with 5 wings. I probably would've even been ok with the snack as the wings were filling! In the past, I've had bad/weird experiences with boneless wings having weird nubs and tendons but these were great. I got salt and vinegar fries which were basically regular fries with that popcorn flavouring sprinkled on. They were fine but I'd just rather actual vinegar...ya know? Service was fine, the atmosphere was like a sports bar with TVs all over the place showing different sports. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Don't waste one minute waiting to be seated at this place.  The absolute worst dining experience ever.  Our grandkids suggested that we have dinner there...wait was ridiculous, service atrocious, food marginal at best, order wrong and never was completely delivered.  Manager was completely inept and it is no wonder why our experience was the worst ever.  If it wasn't for the  location traffic this place would be long gone.  If the Yard House wait is two hours take it.  I have been to BWW four times, four different locations and pretty much the same result...this is the absolute last time I will step foot inside a BWW.  I did warn everyone in advance, but the grandkids won...not next time."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar setting, more TV's than you could ask for, clean setting but.... The food is just barely eatable & overpriced.  Some of the worst wings around, their only saving grace is the multiple sauces to choose from.  Service usually goes from aggravatingly slow to horrible, though we did have one good waiter, once.  If you just want to watch the game & have a beer it is fine, just don't go hungry."}
{"text":"The Canadian versions of the place are similar, although the wings are usually half the size. In the US I would rate this place 5 stars, here usually 4 stars but this location gets 3 because theres a specific manager (can't remember the name) who just doesn't care about any issues brought up.  Other than that most of the staff is friendly and the food tastes the same."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here before the movie, as we had some time to kill. Sat in the bar area, at a high top table. The table was not cleaned off, but the waitress did so when she came over. We ordered drinks, a margarita and a country club cooler. After 15 mins, the drinks came, margarita was ok, but there was NO vodka in my drink!!?i had a few sips.. Nope, no vodka. Our waitress, Tricia, was not attentive  at all. I had to go up to the bar and get water. It took 40 mins to get our food! At 1 point she came over and said, you don't have food yet? Ummm is here food on our table?? No.. No food yet. Now for the drink with no vodka.. I ordered a shot, I told Tricia the drink had no vodka, I'd like to order a shot to put in it, it took 8 mins to get that!!  Instead of her saying hey let me get that made right.... So never coming here again! Btw... Shot cost 6.00.. Drink was 6.50.. Smh"}
{"text":"The only reason if am giving 2 stars is because there are so many TVs and when I have a husband who wants to watch every sports game - that is helpful.  However the service here sucks.  And I have been here about 4 times in the past year and each time it has been horrible.  It feels like staff is made up of people who just want a paycheck and do not realize they are in the service industry.  This place is so close to my house and yet I still hate going here."}
{"text":"Been to B Dubs before but never this one. Went to watch the NFL Draft last Thursday. Sat at the bar with a friend and had a couple beers and some boneless wings (honey bbq) and fries. We were there for 3 hours and the staff was very friendly and the bartender didn't pressure us to get more stuff like some places will if you're there too long. The bar area had all the major games on and the draft. They had the volume on for the draft and there were a few others in there watching as well.   Amazing that I called a number of so called \"NFL Team bars\" around town and none were doing any specials or events for the draft. Sad. Two of the places I called the girl that answered didn't even know what I was talking about when I asked if they were showing the draft. At least BWW had something going on. They get bonus points for that.   Otherwise wings were delicious as always and service was good."}
{"text":"OK, so for somewhere with the word wings in the name, wouldn't you think they specialize in wings?  And if they specialize in wings, wouldn't you think they should be amazing?  Wrong.  These were the worst wings I ever had, and I mean ever.  They were tough, not crispy and overall scary to eat.  Plus on an order of 10, they brought us 8.  They never said anything, and 15 minutes later, brought us another 2.  We waited nearly 20 minutes for these lousy wings, yet when I returned a couple of mine that were inedible, new ones were brought out only minutes later, so they obviously don't take that long to make in the first place.  And the place was not busy.  They get one star because the service was good as was their selection of sauces and because there is no lower rating available.  Unfortunately, the wings are not meant for human consumption."}
{"text":"I came to this Buffalo Wild Wings for take out. It was not very crowded yet still took them almost 40 minutes for a couple of boneless wings... the service was super friendly and it was very clean. I usually don't have bad experiences at BWW so I will try it again the next time I am in town"}
{"text":"I like wings, I like sports, I like to play trivia. B-dubs does what it is supposed to do. James, Kyle, and Rachel behind the bar are pros. People complain about the price, it's comparable to the competition. It's a good sports bar and convenient location for us."}
{"text":"Walked in with my husband and 2 children at 5:30 on a Thursday and it was like walking into a nightclub. Music was not family friendly and staff was dancing inappropriately in front of customers, left before we even ordered drinks. Will NEVER go back! I use to love b dubs...but no more"}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, fun bar. There are quite a few Buffalo Wild Wings in the valley and they're a fun place to grab a quick lunch or dinner and watch the game.   They have a pretty good garden burger and their buffalo chips (french fry-ish things) are really good.  If you like bloody mary's, they have the best one. It's so good...really spicy and filled with celery and olives.  Be careful when you come though, if there is a game on, you'll have to get there early or you definitely won't get a spot to sit."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but unfortunately it has slowly went down hill and after the experience our table had tonight I don't think I will be coming back and I will not recommend anyone to come here. Our server was Tiana and we were not pleased with the service. Server wasn't very friendly and didn't ask us for any drink refills. She seemed like she was in a hurry to get us out of there, didn't ask us if we wanted another beer or anything. She disappeared for a very long time when we were ready to pay and we had to ask two other servers for help. When waiting for the check after ordering a second beer it took over 30 minutes to be cashed out."}
{"text":"Shouldn't go unless you want to be sexually harrassed by a bartender who sends/shows dick pics to customers and also overcharges your card $20 btw the bartender works graves and his name is mike...... I will never be going back to this location."}
{"text":"The only reason to come here would to be for the chicken wings. That's the only thing these people possibly can't screw up.  I got the chicken quesedilla one time, trying to be adventurous, and it was gross. Chicken in it had a weird texture, and whatever sauce they put in it tastes like vomit. And the tortilla was soggy.  I went here with a friend of mine and her little sister yesterday. The waitress was nice at first, but for some reason wanted to get irritated over the fact that we added something to our order. I don't see why she was a rush to get us out the door, the place was completely empty, save the bar area, and she was acting like we were a burden of great means. She wasn't even the one that brought out the rest of our order, and we waited 45 minutes for her to decide to come back over to our table again with check (and no, she wasn't busy, she was standing at the cashier, staring out the window. No tip for you pukebag!)  The wings are pretty good though, most of the sauces I have tried have been pretty awesome too, but the highest in hotness I've gone has only been Caribbean Jerk. Not a big fan over super spicy, but I'm sure they're just as good as the other ones.   The cool thing about this place is that it's a great place to watch the game, or any sort of sport really, they got big tvs, little tvs, medium tvs, tvs, tvs, tvs everywhere, and they're not all on one channel so you're not forced to watch baseball, but can in fact observe the UFC fight on the tv next to it. Pretty cool  I used to come here all the time with a friend and drink at the bar, Colby is an awesome bartender and makes me the frilliest, faggoty drinks I can possibly request. He's always nice and puts up with mine and everyone elses drunken asshattery whenever we're there. Would of sat up there this time around had it not been for my friend having her little sister."}
{"text":"Summery: Avoid  The lady and I were hungry after doing some shopping at the nearby malls. We were trying to settle on something between food court and 200$ dinner. We normally avoid chains and this reminded us why.  Sit down at the bar, order a few drinks to get things going. They are slightly under poured... but what gets me were the garnishes. Her orange goose and soda came with the tiniest sliver of orange you have ever seen, you could see through it... my captain and coke had no limes. We didn't order from the well... at least gives us a proper pour and some proper garnishes... 1 star  First bar course is cheese sticks.. how can you mess this up? Fry it so long the cheese bursts out and inside is a hollow tube of burnt oil and crust. Yummy. The one 2oz portion cup filled half full with marinara sauce didn't really work for 6 cheese was-there-at-one-time sticks...  1 star  But before I had a chance to complain the main course arrived.   Mine looked like a kids meal.. it was a jerk chicken sandwich...inedible. The chicken was fine, but it was ruined with a combo of bad spice and terrible sauce. The bun was a plain white grocery store style... probably came from sams club.. it wasn't what I remember bw3 being like on the east coast. I estimate the chicken served was on the smaller side oft 4oz.. I ate less than half of it. The french fry chips on the side, which were actually good, numbered in the teens. A huge rip off though when paired with a disgusting sandwich and overall portion size. 1 star  She had boneless wings which were fine, by themselves around 3 star. They had obviously been \"quality checked\" because one of the them was missing. -1 star... But the worst offense was being served without celery. - 1star...  total= 1 star..  Service was terrible. I don't hold the bartender responsible for badly cooked food. But nobody asked us if we liked it. The runner auctioned food around the bar and the bartenders who took the order didn't step in to straighten things out. After our baskets sat pushed aside we felt like we were being ignored waiting for the bill.  Leaving was the best part of the meal. BWW is not the best place ever to begin with... but this location is the worst I have ever been to."}
{"text":"If you like heated dog food on a bun with runny cheese then by all means order the Philly cheesesteak sandwich.  It was aweful.   I tried to tame the taste with a bit of queso but it failed.   They charged me for the minuscule side as well.     I guess the wings might be ok but the other food needs to be labeled HAZMAT.    Food server was nice."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Buffalo Wild Wings in years and now I remember why! The food is beyond mediocre.  A measly portion of Garlic shrooms that has no garlic flavor whatsoever for $6.49? Buffalo chips that are as bland and boring as cardboard? Chicken wings that do not impress at all? Ummmm NO thanks.   They don't offer family packs or combos either so that's another downside for me. My husband raved once on how good the Garlic Parmesan wings are so I figured why not try BWW for a change, such poor decision making on my end! Lol. It wasn't that bad but definitely not something I would crave. Lemon Pepper wings hold nothing compared to Wingstop's.  I'm sure it's a fun place to hang out at and enjoy watching your favorite sports games, but I just don't think it's enough to make me wanna come back knowing the food is laughable. There's a reason why my patronage remains with the competition."}
{"text":"We went to see the ufc fight Saturday .While eating our food a roach walked by my nephew got up and killed it . One of the waiters seen this happen and just smiled nice I WILL NEVER GO BACK"}
{"text":"BW3 used to stand for Buffalo Wild Wings and Weck.  What happened to Weck?  Was he fired?  Can they legitimately still call themselves BW3 if they are really BW2?  Is that misleading?  Are they Buffalo Wings and Water now?  That won't work because only Beer washes down chicken wings properly.  Then they would be BW2&B.  That's just awkward.  Anyway, I had the jerk chicken sandwich.  They actually pulled it off better than I expected.  The spice rub had plenty of pleasant hottness and it was seared and slightly blackened.  The wings were pretty tasty (I grabbed one of my wife's) but not as good as the ones I make at home.  Service was good and the atmosphere was an interesting and almost fun mix of sports bar and family restaurant.  We happened to hit on Guitar Hero night so the kids liked that.

{"text":"Another chain I have visited recently.  Good place to catch Red Sox games if you don't have an MLB package with your cable or Direct TV.    If you need to take proactive steps in order to consume a food is that good?  I really like the habanero mango sauce.  On Thursdays they have .60 chicken fingers (boneless wings) and I have gone a couple times and had them with the habanero sauce.  Problem is the sauce is very hot.  Spicy hot.  When you eat it.  As it works it's way through your system.  As it works it's way out of your system.  Spicy.  If you order wings ask for them crispy.  They will cook them a little more and give them the nice crunchiness just like at home.  Other than wings and boneless and beer Buffalo Wild Wings is probably a two star joint."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first day living in PA and the first day of hockey playoffs. We wanted to watch a non-penguins game so Buffalo Wild Wings was the safest choice.   THE BAR AREA: The place was filled with jerseys and fans braving the workday to cheer on their home team. The staff was kind enough to put the Red Wings game on a side TV for us. Back home in TX it's hard enough getting one TV for hockey but this place was FILLED with hockey! Bless you PA. Bless you.  SERVICE: There is no \"I\" in this BWW'S \"team\"! Our waitress was prompt and attentive. Our food was brought out by many different team members so it was served as it came out the kitchen.   FOOD: The wings were saucy, the burger was delicious, and the buffalo chips were the cherry on top. We didn't make happy hour which was a bummer but the tall beers were a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Service from Doug horrible. He is very rude and disrespectful. I'm sitting at the bar and each time I run out of the ice tea, he just walks by and ignores me. Even when I try to get his attention, he would pretend not to see me. He picks and choose who he wants to service, and I'm not one of them. When he feels like it, it's like he is force to get the refill or the food I order. The way he talks to people, you can tell he doesn't care. He is rude and disrespectful to the other customers as well. I even overheard him blame another bartender for his own mistake! He has his moments of pissy mood and starts to slam things down. He has the attitude of I don't give a f&$k attitude! The only good thing he is good at, from what I seen, is to scare the customers off, and constantly disappearing!"}
{"text":"Go early or go late....... don't go between 1700-2000hrs, it's a wait!!  GOOD wings and GREAT staff - go to the bar to avoid the loud little kids!!  It's a great local spot and I've had ZERO issues with food/brews - the wait is the pain - but a coooool spot to watch the games!   Go Hawks!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today to pick up a large carry out order. The young man working the take out counter was very kind and had a pleasant attitude. Food was hot and ready, love this location  :)"}
{"text":"Great food, pleasant sporting atmosphere, waitstaff was creative in how they helped their guests. Had the wings, street tacos- very good! It was busy, but not packed. So, you could find a seat if you needed. No smoking areas detected."}
{"text":"A little dark but good service and good coverage of the games. Mango habanero sauce is hot! But amazing."}
{"text":"First time at this Location. I had the lunch special with boneless wings and substituted a salad for French fries. The food was very good. No complaints there. I have to give three stars because of the service. The server asked us if we wanted to play trivia when she took the drink order. She only brought my drink which was regular instead of diet, forgot my daughters altogether and never brought the trivia devices. The food took forever to get to the table and never asked us if we needed refills on drinks. So in conclusion food was good but service was lacking. I probably will go to BWW again but not to this location"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! This place is not the same since the change in owner. Its dirty nasty, smells like ass and feet. The employees are rude. And they have this person in the kitchen yelling out names/numbers some shyt like that very annoying. Very unorganized...."}
{"text":"Wing Tuesdays!   Wing Tuesdays are 50 cent/wing on Tuesdays.. You can get 6 for $3.00 (6 is the min order). My husband always orders the Honey BBQ and I order the Mild sauce.   The special does not include drinks or fries so you have to order that separately. I highly encourage the potato wedges with cheese, then dip them into mild sauce and ranch.   The prices on any other day are about average with the rest of the market. Plan on spending at least $15 per person incl taxes and tip. All their food is great.   Sit at the bar if you want fast service. They take approx 15 mins to bring your food which gives you time to check email return phone calls and catch up on your Hollywood gossip as you wait."}
{"text":"BWW is just okay.  The service is always just BARELY acceptable.  On multiple occasions, I've had to send back the chili con queso or spinach artichoke dip because it was cold in the middle.  I also HATE their side salads with all that frickin' curly lettuce.  It makes me feel like I'm eating a houseplant.  Upside?  I like the sauces.  Caribbean Jerk and Garlic Parmesan.  Oh heck yes."}
{"text":"Good wings, but overpriced.  I still consider them overpriced on wing Tuesday."}
{"text":"We had a very redeeming visit. Food was perfect, service was great. Thank you to to management for making things right."}
{"text":"If you don't have cable and you really want to watch a sports game; especially ones that don't involve Chicago teams, this is the place to be. Most mom 'n pop sports bars will always have all their channels on a Chicago team that's playing. Buffalo Wild Wings has a wide array of TV's to cater to all sorts of sports fans. The only foible is the fact that they don't put on closed captions for any of the channels. It'd be nice to actually read what the announcers are saying.   The food is your standard fare for an American place. I usually go with the build-your-own burger. The burgers and fries satisfy, but don't completely fill you up."}
{"text":"Have had some good experiences at Buffalo Wild Wings in the past but can't really recommend this place anymore due to my last experience here.  What happened?  Came on a Thursday night to watch a football game.     Place was mostly cleared out, I'd say that about 60% of the restaurant was completely open.  I sat down with my girlfriend, waiter shows up to get our order, we get some appetizers, cheese sticks to start off with.     Now me and my girlfriend are sitting watching the game, the cheese sticks arrive, they're pretty good, and everything is cool.    Then the waiter comes back within about a minute of bringing the cheese sticks and asks if we're ready to order, we shake our heads as we haven't even finished eating the cheese sticks.  Within another minute, he's back again, so we just go ahead and order our entrees and everything is cool, the waiter vanishes, and we're back to watching the football game.   We get our entrees, I ordered a Big Jack Daddy burger, normally delicious but somewhat off, the pulled pork was cold, the burger was dry and had barely any BBQ sauce on it so I asked the waiter for some.  My girlfriend's biting into her chicken tenders which also were somewhat under-par.      The waiter comes back with the BBQ sauce, then disappears again, we're watching the football game and within a few minutes, he's back, asking if we want desert.................um, while I'm not even halfway done with my entree.       We say no, go back to our food and at this point, some Buffalo Wild Wings honcho, maybe a manager stops by our table and asks how things are, I say alright although privately I'm starting to feel a bit crowded.    Then as I'm just finishing my entree, the waiter comes by, swoops the plate and takes off.    Next thing I know he's coming to the table, shoving the check next to me and saying he can \"get it whenever we're ready\", which at this point I feel like I'm getting the bum's rush and I look around the restaurant and realize that its even emptier than we got there.       I made a point of asking him if maybe they were closing early or something and he got defensive and walked off.        At that point, I didn't see him the rest of the night, but I did notice on the bill that he had the audacity to charge us for the extra BBQ sauce I asked for to cover up the dryness of the overcooked burger and the fact that they barely put any sauce on it to begin with.        The fact I was being charged for BBQ sauce in a place that serves it up en masse was ridiculous.     What's next?   Fork and knife rental fees?   First time I've been charged for that at any restaurant, and especially at Buffalo Wild Wings.        Putting that on top of the lousy, pushy service was enough for me to leave the lowest tip I've left at any restaurant.               I'd understand on a busy night about table turnover but sitting back on a nearly completely dead evening, we're one of a few handful of tables actually filled in the waiter's section, watching a football game while ordering food and getting basically tossed out.     No thanks, there's many other places where I can get decent food without being treated like the waiter is doing me a favor and not the other way around.     I'll try the Buffalo Wild Wings location out at Norterra but this whole experience was pretty much a bust for me, cold food, dry burger, lousy service and on top of that, getting nickel and dimed on the BBQ sauce.     No thanks."}
{"text":"Wings were well done, seasoned to perfection, and came with just enough ranch dressing to soothe our taste buds; we had the Asian Zing flavored wings. The salsa and chips were fresh (appetizer), and the serving size enough for at least a few to share with no problem."}
{"text":"I used to hate wings, anywhere. I LOVE them now. I love that there are so many different types here. The best thing here too, if they're not too busy, they will grill them for you.... but please tip the cooks. They'll love you for it and it takes more work and time. Service is usually pretty good, but the bartenders know my boyfriend and I.  I like to splurge 1-2 days of the week and I try to stay really healthy with my diet the rest of the week. This is one of my favorite \"eat my heart\" out places, or \" eat because I'm so drunk \". But I don't drive, I promise.  The best wings there in my opinion - Mango Habenero Parmasen Garlic Sweet BBQ  Wild  They usually have a few really good IPA's on tap too. Dead Guy is my favorite.   For appetizers...eh. They're average like most places. The breaded mushrooms are good, but that's about it.   The downside - Their ranch and bluecheese dressing is just on the okay side. I think they need to revamp that."}
{"text":"Based on my last review my husband & I were pleased because it was the best of the locations we've been to. We decided to come here again for last nights fight and as usual it was busy which is to be expected. When we checked in the hostess asked if we were ok with family style seating & we said yes. When we were being brought to our seats there was a family of three in a booth & we would've sat across from them in same booth. That seemed awkward so we asked about it & hostess said it was family style because it's fight night this is how they seat unless you are at the bar. Maybe it was wrong of us to assume what family style meant but I think that management should reword what they have their hosts explain this. Perhaps say because it's fight night you may be seated with another party so it's more clear."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar. The food was OK.  Plenty of beers."}
{"text":"Very surprised at how good it is. This place was terrible before. In fact I refused to come here for years. Decided to give it a try for my brothers bday. Wings are now jumbo sized unlike pizzeria and fried well. The service was amazing as well. Thanks Taylor, you definitely know how to treat and pay attention to customers. You should get a gold star or  something haha. Even my step dad who works in the customer service world was surprised. To future reviewers, rate on the food not the service. It's such an irresponsible use of this service doing so. You can rant all you want in the comments. Almost didn't come here because of the 2 and a half stars. All I care is about the food, nothing else.  Sauces wise, the spicy garlic isn't garlicky at all. If you like curry, the Thai curry was actually great. My mom loved the lemon pepper the most, I'd agree if I didn't think wingstops lemon pepper was better. It's missing more of that puckering goodness. The wild sauce was my favorite hot sauce. Then there's blazin.. I love the heat/spiciness but damn.. it's just not that good flavor wise. Just being honest."}
{"text":"i believe this location is the one right next to the outlets. this means, lots of parking spot! +1 for that already.   our party of 13 came in and we were quickly accommodated. i ordered my usual mango habanero and asian zing. i wasn't in the mood for burn-my-mouth spicy, so i went with the \"wild\" sauce instead of blazin. like always, the mango habanero and asian zing didn't disappoint! yum! i love the contrast of sweet and spicy! i love crispy, sauce-y wings!  the \"wild\" flavor was a disappointment however. it wasn't spicy at all and it was quite dry. i don't think i'll order that again.   in addition to this, our waitress was really nice! we asked for a bunch of those little blue things to play games on...the trivia game is so much fun. you've got to be sure to ask for the game things so you and your friends won't be bored while waiting for food to come out!   the second best thing at this place after the wings? our server's competence! she saw a big group, knew this would probably mean a lot of calculating who owes what, and helped us avoid this altogether. the receipt came out with everything broken down by each individual, their food, the tip and tax added to it..THE MOST ORGANIZED RECEIPT I HAVE EVER SEEN, and the easiest experience i've ever had paying in a large group.   this is a definite spot to swing by for those wing cravings while in vegas!"}
{"text":"On Tuesday, 8/15/2017, me and my coworkers were craving some BWW. Since our lunch is an hour and we are limited with our time we decided to put our order in online. We put the order in at 11:30 and set the pick up time for 12pm (30 minutes should be plenty of time to prepare our order). Note: we only put in 2 separate orders that we were going to split between the 4 of us, so not like there was a lot to prepare.  We come in at 12pm and walked up to the pick-up line. Behind the counter was Jazmine. Jazmine lacked customer service and common courtesy. No eye contact, no welcoming us to BWW, no nothing. Our pick up time was at 12pm but we did not get our order until past 12:20pm. That is ridiculous! What is the point of putting in an online order with our payment info if they aren't going to even prepare it until we got there? Jazmine didn't even apologize. She just gave us attitude the entire time and made like we were a burden. Even the manager didn't apologize to us! I'm sorry, but don't assign someone to the front to deal with customers if your customer service is below non existent.  On top of that, don't advertise a sign saying \"if your order isn't ready in 15 minutes, your meal is free!\", if you don't pull through with what you're advertising. AND on top of that they shortest us wings!!! If I paid for 20 wings, don't try to be sly and give us only 17!  I will put my sincerest thank you to the Host named Alex. It is beyond me that the host was more sincerely apologetic and helpful than the manager of the place! Alex should be given a raise or even promoted! Thank you Alex for greeting us and doing the servers/managers job."}
{"text":"Our server, Katelyn, was very nice. All the food came out hot and timely. The hostess upon arriving was not such a great experience however. Being the first face you see of the establishment it was clear she did not want to be there and could not really care about our experience. Would have been 5 star review if it wasn't for that."}
{"text":"Great Place to watch sports and eat wings, especially with the big projection screen that plays out important championship games and most definitely, the NBA playoffs! Lets go Lakers.  Great selection of flavors for the wings.  My favorites are the asian zing, caribbean jerk and the mango habanero (it's hot as hell and gives me a stomachache every time.  Their fries are pretty good too.  I haven't really tried anything else to give an opinion about it.  Best thing about this location is that it's open 24hrs, so if you're craving wings for some reason late at night, this is the place to go!  It's .45 cents a wing during late hours and on tuesdays."}
{"text":"If you like Buffalo Wild Wings don't come to this location. The only good thing was the service- even though our food took forever to make it to our table. Long story short food was missing ingredients, burnt, and dry."}
{"text":"I love this spot. Specially the night crew at the bar. Bartender mike Is always welcoming & takes good pride in his job. & serves A+, good wings, Good beer, good crowd with good workers."}
{"text":"It was ok had to ask for napkins. Hello this is a wing place napkins should be first thing they bring  not impressed with this chain. Our first time here most likely our last."}
{"text":"Terrible service ! Spent too much time for small Order , not nice when stepped in , got the food is cold , not any apologize for the late food ! Don't wanna go anymore  !"}
{"text":"Love the BDubs but dang this place has plumbing problems. I'll still come but hire a back up plumber for lords sake."}
{"text":"Was really contemplating on writing this review but a lot of people I've spoken to about it insist that I really do because the treatment and blatant disrespect as well as other feelings shouldn't be given out to any other potential customer. I came to this location on Friday around 6PM for the NBA finals game 4, I had my friend with me, who is visiting. We sat at the bar which had two bartenders, older male with gray hair, another male with a full beard, both occupied at the time we sat around a few empty seats. Felt we were seen but I dismissed it in my head and gave him a pass I'm sure it's been busy maybe he's getting a small break, let him finish his conversation with the other bartender. I don't demand service the minute I'm seen I know how work can be so I am a fair person. Then to the left of me two guys came, few shades lighter than me...yeah I am a darker individual as well as my female friend that was with me, but I'm doubting that has anything to do with anything and then the older bartender turns around and starts walking across the bar and picks up two menus. He has to walk by us to give them the menus, they are directly next to me, as he walks by I ask him \"Hey excuse me could I get a menu please?\" He acted like he didn't hear me then leaned over to the guys to assist them, their faces were in shock and I asked them if I can see their menu right in front of that bartender since he doesn't want to help us it seemed. He continued to take their order and act like he didn't see us come in first, like he didn't see/hear me ask him for a menu, and as if he didn't just stand there ignore me and watch me ask the customer whom he just gave the menu to for their menu. The customer said something to him regarding us and he ignored that too, then the bartender gets their beers and comes to my friend and I and asks \"what can he do for us?\"...Not even an apology or yet just a lie like at least to justify the total disrespect he gave, I told him I'm fine and if the other bartender can assist us, but no...now that bartender goes and does his own thing and just stays across the bar away from us, we still sit quietly and just maybe because we were in shock we're getting this type of treatment. The bartender with the beard still hasn't come around and it's been more than 20mins, a new customer comes in and I see the bartender with the beard walk over and gladly assist. Since my friend formerly was a restaurant manager before she decided to get the store manager. The manager, a female with a single ponytail, comes and pretty much makes excuses for her bartenders behavior, I understand you want to have your teammates back but what's wrong is wrong, and with soooo much hate going on right now in these times I felt like the last thing you would want to do is defend something that is seemingly close of that nature, especially in such an establishment like Buffalo Wild Wings. We are telling you as a manager how disrespectful and shocked we are feeling and as a manager you're going to say \"oh he didn't see you\", I didn't say much until that point because I let my friend talk calmly with the manager being that they should be able to relate coming from the same fields, however that was not the case. When the manager denied that he saw us then I asked well what about when I tried to get his attention as he walked in front of me? And i asked him? The manager is lying to us on his behalf like we're not some 30 year olds and are some 7 year old kids that just experienced this total disrespect. As my friend decided to just ask how can we fix this because the manager clearly was accepting this behavior and fine with it, the manager lets us know \"YOU CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE IF YOU DONT LIKE WHATS GOING ON HERE\" and my friend said really? As a manager and you as customer this is what you're going to say to me? And the manager repeated herself, for the record we did not get belligerent or make any noise so we left looking embarrassed as if we were in the wrong for visiting while everyone else seems to be getting taken care of equally, if my money is no good at this location and I can't receive equal service because then fine I'll definitely go elsewhere like the manager said but only elsewhere to escalate this situation to a higher manager so that nobody else experiences this in 2018 because it truly was not right for employees to give the Buffalo Wild Wings brand this outlook."}
{"text":"We love Buffalo Wild Wings but this location is horrible. Not only is the service bad but the food too! We always went to bdubs back home and Michigan so we know how we like our food. After waiting for a hour to get our food the fries were cold and the chicken was still not cooked hard like we asked. Not to mention the table behind us got up and left after getting there drinks 30 mins after they've been sitting there waiting for someone. Just bad service and Food. The manager looked frustrated with the workers when in reality he needs to have more waiters/waitresses instead of expecting 2-3 to wait on the entire restaurant"}
{"text":"I know BWW is a chain, so I usually wouldn't review. However, the service at this location is absolutely terrible. On multiple occasions, the servers are unaware of the beer selection on tap. During our last visit, my friends and I (4 total) went for dinner and the server was rude, lazy, and failed to share the happy hr specials with us. Refills (once we finally received drinks) were lacking. The cherry on top was the amount of attention the table next to us received. It was a complete 180. Out of convenience, I am sure my group of friends will most likely go back but for the food/location and not the service"}
{"text":"If you want to watch some football games and drink a beer this is the place.  If you want wings you'd probably be better off going elsewhere.   I've had both the boneless and the traditional chicken wings here, both were small and lacked the sauce.  The size of the wings for the price isn't worth it in my opinion and then top that with them skimping on the sauce and you have yourself a place barely worth visiting.   If not for the beer specials and the TVs I'd probably never go back, but alas I have friends that still like the place."}
{"text":"Our server was terrible. Right from the git go he came off in a bad manner asking what we wanted to eat right when walking up. Tipped him out regardless because I know how hard the job is. I accidentally left my sunglasses there on the table. Called back in the morning first thing and of course they say there's nothing there. Slimy staff"}
{"text":"I would like to rate 5 star for any restaurant that I really want to return. For BWW, I love their new dry seasoning wings! They just remind me my college life...   However, I have to rate it 4 star because I only want to go there on Tuesday, when there is a discount on those wings."}
{"text":"Recently here for KSU homecoming.  They were apparently unprepared for homecoming and the crowds as food and drink orders were slow (30 minutes) to arrive.    The place was so loud you could not hear the person next to you.  The food was mediocre.  We had nachos which hardly had any cheese on them, some french fried pickles which were bland, and a variety of wings which were ok.  The facility is clean and bright with lots of TVs showing sports if that's what you are into."}
{"text":"I think it's pointless to review a Buffalo Wild Wings, I think most people that are going to go here aren't 'foodies'. This place was horrible, I will never go back. The service was slow and they got most of our order wrong. The wings were okay nothing fabulous. I got the chips and salsa as a side...they were Tostitos and jar salsa, same with the ranch. Also the coleslaw was bland and really tasted like a head of cabbage cut up. Really...it's not hard to make salsa and fresh chips and coleslaw. If I wanted store bought items I would have eaten at home. You're a restaurant and you serve crap food. You're also located in middle of restaurant haven, why would I ever go back? I wouldn't! Oh and tend to your bathrooms, 3 towel dispensers and all empty. Also the atmosphere sucked. I felt like I was in a school cafeteria with tvs."}
{"text":"The yelp reviews are 100% accurate. The staff gives zero shits. I had been here once before and the bartender at the time was nice and on his game. Tonight I walked in (No one acknowledge me) I went and sat at a mostly empty bar. No bartender behind the bar. I see him walk from out back, he looks at me and walks to the other end of the bar to have a conversation. I sat there for 10mins as not one person said a thing to me. I got tired of waiting and left. How corporate is ignoring all these horrible yelp reviews is baffling. If you're in this area go to distills or PTs, don't waste your time here unless they restaff the place."}
{"text":"I have gone to this Buffalo Wild Wings for a while now. It's a chain yes, but a good chain none the less. I love their sauce options and am a real big fan of the Parmesan Garlic. Being a guinea, garlic is my weakness. The only thing that lures me in even more is adding parmesan cheese to it. It reminds me a lot of the Italian Style wings we use to make at our old pizza place. They also have a great Mango Habanero that I enjoy, great for fans of spicier sauces. It's sweet and very spicy as the name implies.They have awesome buffalo chips when they decide to actually fully cook them. Often times they are slightly undercooked and that makes them just kinda Meh. I do take out from here more often, but occasionally eat in the bar area.   The staff is always friendly and they get bonus points for being so helpful with putting Rob's tournament on the big screens with audio and everything. What else is pretty awesome is they have $3 Jack Daniel's, Domestic Drafts and something else after 10. Along with $3 appetizers. They also have specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays. If I remember correct they are special priced regular wings on Tuesdays and boneless wings on Thursdays.   Sometimes I do prefer Wing Stop but I'm not passionate one way or the other. It kinda depends on what area I'm at. Also WIng Stop is way more of a takeout place, where Buffalo Wild Wings is the kinda place you can chill with friends and catch a game.  Also completely unrelated to the review, I really dislike calling this place B Dubs. I know the name Buffalo Wild Wings isn't short or catchy but that nickname is a pet peeve of mine. Maybe because of hearing people call George W Bush, G dub. I don't wanna think of that guy when I'm thinking about where to get my eat on. Sorry, rant over."}
{"text":"I love chicken wings, but their wings... they barely pass for my taste. Their flavour chart isn't really in any order, from the four flavours i got; the hot to mild index was all over they place.  The inside of the building is very well done, love the sports Memorabilia is great, friendly staff. I just hope the taste of wings gets better."}
{"text":"I never go into B-Dubs with high expectations. That said, I'm a fan of their Desert Heat dry rub and solid selection of tap beer. The problem is that with this location, and most others, the service consistently is poor.  Slow, mistake-filled, and unapologetic service just gets old, which is exactly why I did not spend a cent in their establishments in 2015 and most of 2016. Well, I'm at that place again!  Most problematic is that a majority of reviews blast B-Dub locations throughout the country and they seemingly do nothing about it. Thanks but no thanks going forward."}
{"text":"Typical bar food. Waitstaff is hit and miss either busy talking to each other of they disappear. The couple next to us tried to order a beer and on the third one selected they had it. I ordered the shrimp in sweet chili sauce and I was surprised how good it was but I would not go out of my way to get it because with the end of lent I think this item will be going away."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here and really disappointed. The food was delivered fast but was ice cold. I think it wasn't cooked properly. I had to cook the wings which defeats the purpose of ordering prepared food. Also they came with candles or something from someone's Etsy shop which made the food smell like the wax. We are also really sensitive to scents and don't even buy anything scented so I really wish something I didn't ask for and isn't even a food item wasnt put in a bag with our food. Gross"}
{"text":"Awesome like always! This is the one I visit the most and always a good experience. Their new app (onion rings/potatoes/prime rib/ nacho thing) was amazing!! Can't wait to get it again! And on Tuesday nights wings are cheaper. I thought it was a pretty good deal considering how many wings we got."}
{"text":"I love BWW in general. Good wings with delicious sauces: Spicy Garlic, Hot BBQ, Garlic Parmesan, and Asian Zing are so good! Now they have some delicious dry rub seasonings as well, I like the Desert Heat.  Service can be not great at this location in particular, but the recently remodeled, added a lot of draft beers, and it looks like they are trying to do the right things."}
{"text":"Great service, party in the back so took a long to bring our food. Strong drinks from Bartender Kelly. I ordered the \"Roasted\" Mushrooms, but they aren't roasted they're fried so BEWARE! Other than that, nice people and clean environment!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after our Backstreet Boys concert and after party. It was past 2am and the food for the 6 of us was very delicious. We ordered a variety of both traditional and boneless chicken wings. We ordered a quesadilla that was simply okay but the wings were certainly delicious.   The service was good and pretty quick."}
{"text":"Been here twice Dine in: stopped for lunch. Quickly say and drink order/ food order taken. Asked about Rising Sun sauce but had sold out :( that's ok, don't hold it against them. Food was delicious and server was great. Diane stopped several times asking how it was. Quick to get check and to go boxes got us.  Second time to go: ordered online. Food was good. Was busy when I went in to pick up but everyone looked happy. To go girls friendly and got order and checkout quickly. Server accidentally spilled a few wings out of box when showing me my order so had it reboxed up for me. Good food, tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Service is pretty bad, ultra slow, the food is pretty good, wings are solid, burger not so much. Taco and quasadia combo was tasty. Cocktails are good. TVs are all around with one big screen. If not the pretty bad service a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went there on Thursday after work. The place was pretty loud inside, so decided to take the patio. The service was really good and the general manager came out occasionally to see if everything was good. The only thing is that we got the \"veggie\" side which was just carrots and celery for 2.99. We were told fries would be included, but the manager gave us the fries on the house. Now the chicken wings (boneless) were amazing. The best was their dry Cajun and BBQ ranch perfect combination of mild and sweet. I would go there again and order the boneless wings on Thursday (65 cents)."}
{"text":"Good food and a friendly staff...good place to stop if you want decent fare at a good price. The place is a chain, so it's formulaic, but they have a good formula and it works."}
{"text":"Don't go food bad and look closely on the bill that says $4 corona and 10% gratuity(tip). ;)"}
{"text":"I love buffalo wild wings  food, but their service everywhere in the madison area lacks significantly."}
{"text":"We've been going to Buffalo Wild Wings in Oakville since they opened their doors.  We've tried everything from the wings, to the salads, to the burgers. The food is pretty good, nothing out of this world.  They have a feature wing flavour once every couple of months, which is a lot of fun to try. I'd say they are mostly pretty good with the definite exception of the maple flavour a few months ago which was absolutely awful.  Unfortunately they don't offer gluten-free options for any of the burger buns or sandwich wraps/buns/bread. I recently ordered a burger without the bun and was disappointed that there were no toppings on the side or on top. The menu clearly states that the burgers are served with tomatoes, lettuce and onions, but there were none served to me when I ordered it bunless.  For the best bang for your buck, the best time to go is Tuesday when the wings are 60c. Fries are not included and neither are dipping sauces.   The fried pickles are excellent, cooked with a cornmeal batter and served with a spicy, creamy dip. I highly recommend them.  If you enjoy watching sports while you eat/drink then this is definitely the place to be as there are huge screens all over the dining room and bar and there are always several different sporting events being shown."}
{"text":"BW3 in Arizona????  OMG! I am so pumped. Nothing is better than chilling at a BW's on a saturday getting ready to watch your favorite college football game.  They have huge tv's, huge selection of beers and some of the best wings ever (imo). You think hooters has good wings...make a trip to bw's and you'll never go back!  You must try the spicy garlic sauce it is delish. My mouth salivates just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for free wifi and wing Tuesdays! My girlfriend and I were in a pinch while Cox worked on our broken internet, so we decided to use the free wifi at BWW and grab some wings. Our server was friendly, the wing sauces were delicious, and of course, the booze was wonderful."}
{"text":"Our waiter was annoying and the lighting was WAY too bright for anything other than a breakfast spot....only it was 11pm (or so).   The food tasted like standard greasy pub food and pretty on par with other store locations.   Dim the lights a bit and we won't be so annoyed with your sloppy rude waiter."}
{"text":"This is a great place to relax with friends and watch your game. The atmosphere was clean and fun for the most part. The staff is young and always friendly lol. Just a laid back place to hang out."}
{"text":"Love my B-Dubs, but this one is exceptionally hit-and-miss  First, I'll confess that I'm a fan of B-Dubs. The dry rubs are my faves-- Salt and Vinegar, Chipotle, Desert Heat... Mmmmm.  Second, this location is so convenient that I'd probably keep going there unless they literally harmed me somehow.  That said, this is a frustrating location to eat at.  One day, your chicken is moist, the seasoning is plentiful, and your server nails your order.  The next visit, your wings and drumettes would more accurately be called \"bony meat crisps\", it looks like seasoning is on  war time rationing, and your server convinces you that s/he has a form of spongiform encephalitis by successfully getting every person's order at least a little wrong and by taking two McDonalds visits to bring the food out.  At least there's a little adventure in each visit... Oh, and lots of TVs to distract me."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night, the waitress wasn't very good and the wings were literally cold like they had been sitting there and they threw some sauce on them. The fries were dry and cold as well. It would be different if they were slammed but there was literally only 5 other tables. The one in Matthews is much better."}
{"text":"Worst service in Ohio. 20 min in, still waiting on chips and salsa. I don't think the salad and wings will ever make it to the table.  Update: 40 min, we still can't get the wait staff to bring the fucking chips and salsa.   Update: We left. They are retarded.  Update: Called the manager, we now understand. He too is retarded.  I don't use the term lightly."}
{"text":"The service is always good, I have never really been a fan of the food. Its nice cause its smoke free."}
{"text":"I sadly just found out Buffalo Wild Wings (named for the wings, not the city) last year.  It's sad because I think the best chicken wings in Happy Valley are being served out of this little dive bar in Happy Valley.  The actual Chicken Wing is standard, large and crispy but where they really stand out is their home made sauce.  Apparently the owner has been offered thousands of dollars for the secret recipe (this isn't your typical Frank's and butter) and I can see why.    No ones wings in taste like these, the sauce is sour but sweet and spicy with flecks of either cheese or garlic, I can't put my finger on it.  They have great fresh cut fries that are strongly seasoned as well as fish fry, burgers, etc.  They only take cash and wait times for food can get into the hour + range because of their small kitchen, but it is so worth it.  Buffalo Wild Wings will rock your socks off"}
{"text":"Every time I call in an order at this location it is a battle with the girls to even get them to understand and place my order. They act like some of my reasonable requests are crazy it seems. They just can't comprehend the fact that you are supposed to take care of the customer. The girl I spoke to tonight was extremely rude and all I asked was for her to add up the total of my order for me because $50 seemed like a lot for something I always order and know the price of. She asked if I wanted her to repeat the order and I said just forget it I'll check the receipt when I get there. Then when I got there she said oh I thought you wanted to just order when you got here. I was blown away lol. What a waist of time and money. Buffalo Wild Wings lost one tonight, atleast the Gilbert location did.   They didn't even follow my simple requests either like nacho cheese on the side in the sampler. It's sad because I love this place, I used to work for the manager Shana. Just ridiculous. They need to make their hiring process a little more intense cuz the girls taking orders are a little unqualified."}
{"text":"I really should be giving them a 1*, but I'm in a generous mood. Service was terribly slow tonight. I had to ask a manager to bring waters to the table. It was boneless wing night, so we tried them... Disgusting. Where's the chicken? I got a basket of hard, crunchy, fried breading. I do not know how this qualifies as food, let alone chicken. Ordered the roasted garlic mushrooms... Since when is a roasted mushroom fried!?!?!? Next, tried to order a Batch 19 draft (from the beer menu)... Oops, we don't carry that. To top it off, the only real food item on the menu (veggie boat) is no longer on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I took our 4 kids tonight for wings.  1st time to this  restaurant.   Blue burger excellent.  Side of fries is smaller than McDonald's small.  30 + min to get food, like pulling teeth getting service.  No ice in drinks, refills were impossible to get, couldn't leave quick enough."}
{"text":"I used to go to B Dubs a lot but their customer service has consistently diminished over time. I placed a carry out order and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. So  I show up 25 minutes later only to find out that my order was still not ready and it would be another 10 minutes. So I payed for my order and proceeded to wait out the 10 extra minutes they estimated. Fast forward another 20 minutes and my food had still not been given to me. Then the girl up front asked me if I had been helped yet. Keep in mind she's the same one that helped me when I first arrived. I couldn't understand how after only 20 minutes she had forgotten that she previously helped me.  I informed her that I was still waiting for my carry out order that she quoted to be only a 10 minute wait (on top of the other 20 minutes) In the end my small $30 carry out order took roughly 55 minutes to be completed when I was initially told 20 minutes. And to top it all off my boneless wings were barely coated with sauce. I will definitely have to be craving wings for me to return and honestly I'll probably fix that craving by getting wings from somewhere else."}
{"text":"I am not a big 5 star giver, but this place is good today.. awesome food, great view on the game.. half off the wings.. doesn't smell like smoke.. loving it right now.."}
{"text":"No one goes to Buffalo Wild Wings for a gourmet meal. They come for the greasy food, the spicy smothered chicken and the atmosphere. They also have a television in every place they could put a television. Their drinks are amazing and the servers are super proactive. My best friend had a problem with her meal and the manager quickly took it back and replaced it. My personal fave is the honey barbecue boneless chicken and the deep fried mushrooms  (who knew that was a thing). They also have a homemade Pico that's pretty darn amazing. I'm glad one of these isn't near my house because the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar/restaurant with cold beer, good food, and a great staff!!"}
{"text":"Casual place that is great to hang by yourself or with friends. They are good allergy friendly too! Ask for the food allergy list from your server. BBQ wings are delish."}
{"text":"Great food, service, everything is awesome! Staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is great. Bartenders are very knowledgeable, and are prompt to remind you of specials and happy hour. I would recommend this place to anyone, although it is a sports bar atmosphere, so it can get a little loud during the busy hours."}
{"text":"There is a legitimate reason this place has bad reviews! It's called terrible customer service!  First, let me say the least culpable person is the waitress that finally took our order because I'm pretty sure we were not supposed to be her table in the first place! Second the manager that finally boxed our food and comped our bill tried, but it was a little to late by that time. Now let me turn my attention to the other wait staff that really were terrible!  It started badly because we asked for a booth and the kid that sat us, failed to use his brain even a little and put us at a table where the seats had shifted making it very difficult to sit down comfortably so we asked to sit at another table which he said was fine but then actually rolled his eyes! Next we waited for 15-20 and still no one appeared at our table, meanwhile two new groups had walked in, been seated, had their drink orders taken and placed their food orders. Finally a bleached blonde that knew we had been sitting there for a while, continued to walk by us repeatedly but refuse to make eye contact (believe me I tried) with us because we were not her table. The black waiter, who I believe was supposed to be our actual waiter to begin with but may have refused to serve us because we switched booths, also repeatedly walked by us (at least 20 times) knowing that we had no drinks and no food server, and he was totally fine with it. We literally had to hold our hands up and waive at the bleached blonde to see if she could find our food server, which obviously annoyed her! Finally, we place our drink order, but meanwhile at least 3 tables that came in after us were eating their food. We then wait another forty-five minutes and still no food, at least 6-8 tables who came in after us were either eating or paying their check! The black waiter (unfortunately, I'm limited to this description because I did not see his name tag so I cannot include his actual name, and he appeared to be the only black male waiter) was so, so awful. I feel compelled to single him out, along with the bleached blonde, in the hopes that he is reprimanded, because he actually thought our situation was funny and snickered multiple time when he walked by us towards the end.  No we did not imagine it, he actually was enjoying himself. Finally, I asked our waitress for the bill for the drinks and said we would be leaving, at that time a floor manager approached us and asked if we wanted our food boxed up to go, the kitchen manger also came out and said our chicken fingers were misplaced which was the reason our food was taking so long! I seriously believe that we would have sat there all night waiting for our food if I hadn't eventually asked for the bill.  All of this because we asked to be seated at a different seat.  For over an hour we were literally the inside joke for the wait staff, all but our actual waitress. One very bad incident.......the result? We will never go back there again!"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend on a Thursday night, food was nothing special but what made our experience truly exceptional was our server Bryant. He was extremely attentive, friendly, and was quick to answer any questions or requests. I work in the service industry so I am always grateful for good service, and Bryant went above and beyond for us!"}
{"text":"My first time eating at a buffalo wild wings. I had some of their wings. They were ok. Ive had better else where. And I had the chicken caesar salad which wasn't bad. But I wont be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"What's there not to like about a 24/7 wing place? When I was craving wings at 2am they came through. Very nice bartender, quick service. Several good flavors of wings to choose from. The wings are a good size with crispy skin outside. The last time we went some wings were a little under done. That's why I take a star off.  Nothing fancy. Just a decent place to pop in for wings and to watch sports."}
{"text":"Jessica is very informative over the phone and polite. Very good at up sale not saying as a bad thing but as a good thing to make sure I didn't forget dessert or any sides or sauces! (:"}
{"text":"Always have a great experience when I visit this location. Just moved to the area and love having BWW a few minutes from the house!! You can never go wrong with the mini corn dogs and pork sliders! I tried a West Coast flatbread the other day and it was EXCELLENT! Perfect size, good amount of chicken and dressings, and the flavor was awesome! Not to mention $3 happy hour cocktails to top it off!   Plenty of TVs all over the restaurant so you can always catch a game in the bar or the dining area if you bring the family! They also have a pretty large selection of draught beers to choose from! Can't wait to return to try some more new things!"}
{"text":"We visit Buffalo Wild Wings quite often, in fact more than I care to admit. But when you have a hankering for wings and a boyfriend who loves the non-stop sports on TV, the choice is quite obvious.  Mostly, we go on a Tuesday or Thursday as their traditional or boneless wings are on special. Because when you want to eat 20 wings to your face, you certainly don't want to be paying $25 for it!  This location has a good group of attentive individuals serving up the goods. The manager visits our table every single time we are there, usually when we are mid bite. But the effort is there and I appreciate that. Fountain drinks are never more than 2/3 empty before you have another dropped at your table.   Their various food/drink specials and new wing flavours keep this old standby on our list of places to go every couple of weeks."}
{"text":"It's amazing this place stays in business. Poor food and even worse service. I have been to multiple locations over the years and always regret going. If it wasn't for all the tv's I would not go back. Beer selection is mediocre. We had wings and they were not good in any way. They need to take a clue on cooking wings and learn from DD Peckers. Hope the management improves the conditions."}
{"text":"I come here a lot with the guys and we usually sit at the bar.  On Wednesdays I come  here for dinner with my son.  This Buffalo Wild Wings tends to have way better service than most others in Vegas.  Especially a waiter in the regular dining area named Denny.  This guy is always super busy but manages to stay patient and even remembers regular customers food/drinks.  I appreciate that especially when we only see him once a week or every other week.   And as usual we love the food and beer selections..."}
{"text":"Always great!   We've been going to Bdubs since the 90's when there was only one in Vegas in N Las Vegas.  Now they are located all over the place.  No matter which location we go to. We always have had great service, food and drinks.  Not to mention... We are huge sports fans and the games are always on.  Done the Blazin' challenge so many times I've ran out of space for the tee's.  I usually get the mango habanero sauce with my food.  Wings or buffalitos are always good. The have good pizza and burgers too and many beers to wet your palet.  My favorite location is the Las Vegas Blvd one connected to the outlet mall."}
{"text":"Another Blazin' challenge down and was still hungry so I decided to get some more wings... why not?  So I got a medium order of traditional with desert heat and scorpion rum on the side.  Always a great time with the family here.  My son and I eat the hot wings and do challenges while my wife eats a wrap and does computer work with the free wifi.   Nice way to hang with the family and watch the ball games.  Jess was our server and she was super cool.  We will definitely be back to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Just had dinner on a Thursday night. Very busy. Got a table after less than 10 minutes. Got a beer and ordered, but our dinner took way too long. The order was mixed up and the bun tasted like it was microwaved too long. Food was mediocre! With so many good restaurants in the area, will not plan to return. Husband had to ask where his beer order was! By the way, manager didn't bend over backwards for food mix up!"}
{"text":"I can always counts on the food from bdubbs to be consistent and bomb. Our waitress Erica was incredibly nice and obviously works very hard! I'm not sure why this place has bad reviews but maybe it's crazy on a busy night. I got the new Santa Fe chicken salad and I changed out my sauce for my chicken which was no problem. I used just the Hot wing sauce and they gave me a side of it to add as I please with the ranch.  We waited maybe 10 minutes for our food. It only seemed like forever because we were starving!  There's plenty of tv screens and I'm sure it can get packed but it was pretty low key. I'm overall happy with my experience and I have nothing bad to say about it."}
{"text":"All the waitresses have nothing but attitude no napkins no utensils no appetizer for 50mins with the place being half empty when the ultimate nachos arrived there was nothing but lettuce on them and asking for some assistance doesn't work in this place"}
{"text":"BDubs! Yes that is the correct name of this place according to me, and the great people at Purdue who introduced me to this chain.  Before BDubs, I didn't eat wings. They just seemed unappealing.. and then i met Mango Habanero. OH WOW. oh wow. OH WOW.   If you like it spicy (like me) then this is it, if not stay on the more savory side and go with garlic paremsean. This is a great place to watch games at, they are very accomodating and the prices arent bad. We got 18 wings, 2 apps all for $21. Wow!"}
{"text":"I have been to a few Buffalo Wild Wings and this one was pretty much the same as the others. We went here after the NASCAR HOF for lunch as it was a convenient stop. The service was decent but not very attentive."}
{"text":"Note: Their website is highly interactive and includes some really fun, free-to-play browser games. I just wasted 20 minutes playing Chicken Joust. Don't get busted at work!   This is one of the stops for the First Niagara Pavilion Roundtrip Bus Service. Yup, it picks you right up in front of Buffalo Wild Wings during the day and drops you off after the show that night.   It's a good thing they're open late as it was going on midnight when we arrived parched and ravenous from the Mayhem Festival on Friday.   I guess they weren't expecting anyone since we had to find a server to ask if the kitchen was still open.   Well, it was, and after a few minutes of waiting, we were seated by our bubbly server Erin. It gave us time to look over the menu and gawk at the numerous flat screen televisions that hang from the ceiling.   I ordered a Big Jack Daddy Burger. Pulled pork, onion rings, jack cheese, and their Honey BBQ sauce are piled atop a generous enough burger patty. It was an adequate burger but surely wouldn't rank in my top 10. I was hungry. It had been a long day. Therefore, it filled my empty belly agreeably.   The fries were little sticks of salted, deep fried, after-hours love.   We also ordered boneless wings as an appetizer and chose the Parmesan Garlic as our sauce.   Eh, they were a little fast-food if ya know what I mean, but again, after an epic adventure in Burgettstown, we didn't mind as it suited our stomachs perfectly under the circumstances.   If you ever find yourself out at a godless hour in Chainrealm and pangs of hunger plague you, this is one of your options. They'll feed ya.   P.S. We were told by our server that \"half the kitchen\" took off work to go to Mayhem. What is it with restaurant employees and heavy metal? Did I miss my calling?  P.P.S. It was unusually quiet and sparse considering that it was a Friday night. We were thinking it would be too rowdy for our tastes. I guess the yahoos were causing a ruckus elsewhere."}
{"text":"Typical BDubs, slow service, orders were wrong, food was cold, nobody cares attitude.  You'd think it would be a good place for groups.  I was wrong.  Never again."}
{"text":"I love that B Dubs is such a relaxed, chill place AND is open 24 hours, although I have yet to even be at one past 10pm. Whether it's to go or dine in I've never had a big problem here (if there's a mistake it's very small and corrected very quickly), always get great service, good prices, great selection of drinks (although the mixed drinks are always super weak, so do yourself a favor and get beer or something nonalcoholic), and now that it's baseball season I love watching games while I'm eating. Food always comes pretty fast even when it's busy, and the food is always ready when they say it will be when I get it to go. I've always been curious to try the trivia they offer but am kind of busy stuffing my face and have messy hands, so it's still entertaining enough to watch it on the tv whilst waiting for food.  We go to B Dubs almost every week (mostly at this location too) and I can't imagine getting sick of it. I try to avoid busy restaurants on the weekend nights but this is always a good default when you don't want to be waiting for a table for 30 minutes to an hour somewhere else. This is a somewhat small location though and on nights with big fights or big games it is pretty crowded, so then I just go to the location on  Hualapai and Flamingo :) the parking lot is shared with a lot of other businesses so the few spots right in front of B Dubs can fill up quickly and you'll have to park off to the side. Almost nothing better than wings and beer, and I tend to order only medium, maybe some honey bbq or mild once in a great while! Garlic parmesan is alright and I'm not a big fan of the teriyaki. My only beef with B Dubs is that the mixed drinks are really lame, they're just so weak that you shouldn't bother ordering one and being pissed about the missing alcohol. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Yum! This place seems to be less busy than the Durango and Warm Springs location I usually go to, so it's my alternate for when that one is packed. Also there are very few business that share the parking lot with this B Dubs so parking is always super easy. Like the other one, always good service and nothing to complain about. My bf and I like to keep it casual, and stuffing my face with wings and enjoying a beer and watching some baseball on Friday nights is just exciting and relaxing enough after a week of work to enjoy. Gotta love the medium sauce! Mild has a lot of flavor without being spicy and honey bbq is pretty good too. Avoid ordering mixed drinks though, it's a waste of money because they're so watered down... so just get some beer. Who can resist beer and wings? Not this girl!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the wings seems like they always screw up my orders i believe that this last order is the only order that they got 100% accurate 5 stars for the wings 3 stars for service 4 stars total"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS BUFFALO WILD WINGS IF YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR TIME!!! Walked in with four other co-workers on a 1 hour lunch break and each of us ordered from the \"fast-break\" lunch menu and we waited 45 minutes to no avail. The server never came by and updated us. We agreed amongst ourselves that we would have to get the food to go. One of our co workers walked up to the front register and was simply told \"it's coming right out\". Food never came out, we got up and walked out. Afterwards I called to speak with the general manager, waited on the phone for 15 minutes, hung up and dialed again and told the person answering the phone that I've been on hold for entirely too long, he apologized and minutes later the shift manager was on the phone. When I told him what happened he said   \"yeah, I don't know what happened we had your food ready as soon as you guys left. It normally doesn't take that long\". I replied that was entirely too long and I'm going to speak to the general manager and I'm writing a review on yelp\"  \"Welp, if that 's what you feel you need to do\" he said.  I said \"this is ridiculous do you realize you haven't even apologized for this incident??\" \"I did\" he said \"i said I apologized for not getting your food out faster and that that normally doesn't happen\". Lies, he never apologized until I said something.  The thing is, we work at the plant nearby and one of my coworkers actually orders the catering for the many meetings that are held here, needless to say she WILL NOT BE ORDERING FROM BUFFALO WILD WINGS. WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO BUFFALO WILD WINGS and as for me personally, I WILL NOT GIVE ANY BUFFALO WILD WINGS MY BUSINESS. I always go to WINGSTOP and have had no issues with them.  Great job buffalo wild wings!  Also if I could i'd give this place a quarter star and it takes A LOT for me to get on here and write a review so that is telling of the situation."}
{"text":"I've been going here since 2011 since its less than 0.6 miles from my place before. Its open 24/7, after 11pm(or midnight?)you have to press the buzzer to get in. Place is big enough. Bar area is huge too,understandly. Clean and organized. This place is almost always packed, day or night. TV everywhere! Kids are not forgotten here,they have games to play with. Never had a problem with any servers. They are very attentive and some of them has good tips on fantasy draft lol.  I like the wings here better than hooters. If only BWW will add clam chowder to their menu, that'll be awesome!  I love the new dry rubs, less messier. Please add mango habanero dry rubs  Will always keep coming back."}
{"text":"We went on Monday before a concert and luckily had 2 hours to kill. I took over 1.5 hours to get our food. Plus the fries where cold old and clearly from a previous order as people had been leaving do to the wait. My sandwich was also at best luke warm. We could not send food back as first our concert was now about to start. Two they closed the kitchen at 650 pm and would not serve any more food, our was last order \"made\". I understand there was also a crowd from an Indians game before hand but that started at 410 and we did not sit until 515 and ordered at 525. Other people got money off we could not unless we waited a half hour for manager which we could not as concert was now starting. avoid this place."}
{"text":"Really poor service! Yes, we were here on a Friday night, but drinks took 20 minutes, and apps took another 45. Both our waiter and the manager were unapologetic, saying that we should expect the wait because it was a Friday. The food was cold when it did finally arrive. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Wow! This place takes wings to the next level! Each table has a server & also a captain. The captain has many awesome 'powers' and will help you out wherever they can, eg changing the channel to a sport you want or giving you sauces to try before committing to a sauce. We tried the top 4 hottest sauces and also the special limited time sauce as well. I absolutely LOVE this idea because there's nothing worst than ordering wings and having a whole serve of something you don't enjoy or is too hot.   Another touch they provide is putting the name of the flavour in each corner so you know which ones you are eating. What a simple yet efficient idea.   If we lived here I would frequent it often!"}
{"text":"Bad bad bad. Waitress did not check on order  had to wait 45 mins. Just to get a sample of thier bluesmoon bbq sauce. Asked for manager and when the manager showed up at our table so did the sample person. The manager had to take our order. While eating my wings I asked the waitress for more ranch and it took 15 mins just to get ranch dressing.  The manager was very professional  and kept my bad situation  under control. But I am still not happy with the overall experience  And will probably  not go back to this buffalo wild wings."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since my daughter was about 18mo old, and let me tell you 1 person/server/manager has consistently made our experiences amazing!!! Phillip has always been so wonderful & attentive to us, plus my now 6yr old is so in love with him!!! Across the board, the servers have always been very good to us, but Phillip takes the cake for exceptional staff & service!!!"}
{"text":"I used my free snackers for my bday  treat, unfortunately I had a better time last yr.. the wings were not overly smother with lemon pepper rub- Hooters wings way better.  I ordered lunch burger, they cooked it med well it was slightly charred burnt, I rather easy burgers juicy medium rare. This was not juicy, sorry would not order that,  if I cannot get my burger the way I prefer? They used to include more that one drink if you were gambling, now maybe barely one on the house,maybe I ll just stay and play at Red rock station. Just not a great  time here, yes I ate my burger I was  hungry, but I doubt I would return for a long time, maybe next yr. Cannot recommend  to my friends. And forgot to mention the drink were totally over iced, so much cubes for an overpriced acoholic drink.."}
{"text":"As usual we had a great time, good food and the service was great! Our server Cheyanne was awesome and made sure we were taken care of. They now carry my favorite hard root beer and Kilt Lifter . Great place to take the kids too!"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere!!! Came to watch the games. I love the Happy Hour Specials. Fun & Energetic staff. Food is fantastic.  There isn't a better place to watch sports and enjoy a night out."}
{"text":"Place was dead but we waited 20 min to be seated because they only had two servers. You would think that on a Sat night they would have more than two servers. I'm not surprised when this place has an overall two star rating. Food was ok. Management needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Worst establishment ever. I'm disappointed to know their Store Manager would condone such acts. Upon entering the parking lot it was small and packed. Packed I could understand for a Sunday but small? I can't. As we walked up to the restaurant we were approached by a musty oder. My husband shook it off to possibly being someone we passed on the way in. Once we entered the building fully, we were smacked in the face with \"the funk.\" It smelled so bad that we had to turn around and immediately leave the building. It was probably 10x as bad as any gym locker room I've ever been in. If that wasn't bad enough it was rowdy and dirty within steps of entering the place. I'm disappointed my first experience of BWW will be my last."}
{"text":"Unless you want a bunch of carbs/cheese, do not order the tailgate sampler!  We got takeout, and it was very disappointing.  There was hardly enough spinach artichoke dip to dip 3 chips in.  The poppers were very boring and the cheese dip was too.  The wings were great though.will not order again.  It was over $12.00 and I ONLY got 4 wings.  Never again?"}
{"text":"Blah.....its been 5 years since my last visit to a BWW .....I remember why. The chicken was ok at best and service a step below the chicken. The dry \"rub\" was not rubbed on.....more like poured on. The beer was cold and a good selection.   I resisted coming here due to BWW's stance on guns and probably won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just... not good.  We want it to be - we have been several times hoping, but the experience is always at best, lackluster.  The food is not great, very run-of the mill on a good day and the serve staff though very nice is always - and I have never had the same person twice - always totally lost and under-trained.  It blows my mind because they can't possibly know alcohol laws if they don't know anything about the menu - going to bite that company one day.  I am not sure but I think someone I know told me they do the shared tip thing and I thought maybe that may be why but I know another place that does that and the service is excellent.  I don't know what the problem is - I have worked in the industry before while in college and I would say front of the house training needs big overhaul.  At any rate, they have lots of TV's and it is closer to us but just plain not good.  I wish they would switch locations with Wild Wing Cafe - also chain-y but much better food and service."}
{"text":"Hot wings are HOTT! It took about 10 minutes for my lips to stop burning, but they were good. I am more sensitive to heat when it comes to food than maybe the average person, however. I love the variety of sauce flavors, but I do think they are pricy.   The first batch of hot wings were crispy, but the next 2 were not; and I do not like soft chicken wing skin! Yuck. So I recommend making sure to order extra crispy if you are like me!  The beer is cold, and they have the Sunday Ticket, so it is a great place to watch football ( while I watch the Indians). But, food is average."}
{"text":"They really need an upgrade on their TV's. The wings are good however a little pricey and it always seems too loud to hear the game. We keep going back as there is not many other places to watch football, eat and drink when you have kids with you."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: we've eaten here before with average food and average service.  It's a BW3, the foods not gonna be life changing.  I noticed a lot of people standing around not working in the past, but it didn't impact our meal eating in.    I do have a current gripe with my most recent experience, however.  We called to place a to go order, was placed on hold for over 5 minutes, then hung up on.  It's close to close on a sports free Sunday night, so I can't imagine that they were so busy that they couldn't take our order.  I was tempted to call back and ask for the manager, but I didn't have time to be on hold for another 5 minutes, so I turned to yelp.   If you come here you'll get the usual bw3 experience with staff that for the most part doesn't give a crap, and don't you dare try to make a take out order."}
{"text":"Dining with a champion earned some extra credit here. Yes, our very own My T (you should know him) conquered the Blazin' Wing challenge (12 insanely spicy wings in 6 minutes) and lived to tell about it. It was like being ringside with Pacquiao. At this location, they gave him a free shirt and he did not have to pay for the wings. (Rumors at other locations, you win the right to BUY the shirt, which would have been lame.)  We went on .45 wing Tuesdays. It's hard to complain about a .45 wing. They have a wide selection of flavors (Garlic Parmesean to Mango Habanero), and the variety somewhat makes up for the skimpy wings. They aren't quality wings, but when drenched with a creative sauce and served for .45, they do okay.   The fried garlic mushrooms are some great guilty bar food for $3 during happy hour. I could have finished off a couple of baskets.  It was crowded, and the service wasn't spectacular. I think our waitress might have been having a bad day. Overall, it's a BWW, and this location probably isn't one of the better ones. But, if you're close by and craving a wing and a big screen to watch some sports, you'll survive."}
{"text":"I've never experienced worse service than I experienced here. My two coworkers and I came in for lunch and were seated in a section that wasn't very busy. We were then ignored by the waitress for a solid ten minutes. I say \"ignored\" because we were at a table smack dab in the middle of the seating area. No way to miss us. To my amazement, however, the waitress proceeded to go around to every table but ours, even bantering with the guests next to us. Didn't say a peep to us. No \"be right with you\" or \"I'll be right back with waters.\" Literally nothing for ten minutes.  I finally got up and let the hostesses know how long we had been seated without anybody coming over. They didn't apologize, but instead went with \"Oh.... well, we'll go let her know.\" They did, and we continued to sit there.  60 seconds... 120 seconds... 180 seconds... 240 seconds... 300 seconds...  Nothing. Not a peep for the entire 15 minutes we were sitting there.  I looked at my coworkers, said \"we're out of here,\" and the three of us got up and left.  I'm not sure who the manager of this place is, but the way it's run is an absolute disgrace.  One star out of five is too generous."}
{"text":"I go every Wednesday night for Live Trivia and when we have Ryan as our waiter we are in hog heaven.  He knows our order before we do."}
{"text":"Do yourself the favor and find another place to eat.  Sat at the bar. Took ages for someone to take our drink order. Not a single smile or anything resembling making my wife and I feel welcome. Nothing. Ordered some beers and food. Got them. Check back? Nope. Nada. Bartender came back finally to ask if i wanted another beer. I wasnt in the mood at that point so i asked for water. He gave me the water and as i thanked him i had the opportunity to thank his back. That was awesome. The food wasnt bad but the service was horrendous enough to warrant negative stars if i was able to.  It is called the service industry for a reason. Never coming back to this location. Not even for a free meal."}
{"text":"The wings are always top notch.. Staff is always very friendly...They have a a ton of TVS great for watching the games... Just found our you can get all drums or flats (wings) if you prefer one over the other, which is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Togo service is lacking professionalism  -hair in food -seasoned horribly  - not attentive to guest - staff eating food in kitchen while talking to employees and guest  - missing wings of the order  Overall just horrible service"}
{"text":"Bad Bad Bad!! Worst BWW I've ever been to. I eat at BWW takeout often but this was my first time at this location and let me tell you I'll never be back. The workers were all way more focused on their conversation than bringing out my food that was supposed to already be ready 5 mins before. Then when I got home (I'm so dumb for not checking my bag) I noticed the 2 ranches and 2 carrot sides I ordered were not even in the bag. So annoying because I don't even like wings without ranch...  Then comes the best part. I open one of my snack sized boneless wings and.... they're so gross. Tiniest crispiest things ever. There was 1 or 2 regular sized wings and the rest were popcorn chicken size. I could crack them in half and there was either no chicken in them or dry crispy chicken.  Totally inedible.  I'd avoid this location if possible."}
{"text":"Came here sunday night 9/3/17 with a party of 5 and 2 kids. It seemed like we didnt have a server or none of the servers wanted to take us, most likely because they saw kids at the table. After a solid 10 mins, We saw a busser walking by sweeping the floor and we asked him if he could get a server for us. A few mins later a server named Tom came to greet us, and informed us there was a mixup in the table rotation, but he was going to be taking care of us. By this time we were all ready to order so we gave him our app order, drinks, & food. He immediately got us a small side of fries for our toddler and brought waters out right away. Our server was very attentive and polite. I got up to wash my hands and on my way to the bathroom I heard one of the guys that brought our app out say, \"yeah, i dont give a f*k\". That was a little disturbing. I know people have regular lives and all, but maybe dont swear around guests. Anyway, our food came out on time, and hot. We got about 5 orders of Traditional Medium. We always ask for \"extra wet\" because it seems they dont wet them enough anymore and theyll be crispy and dry. Overall a good dinner, and despite the long wait time to be greeted, our server Tom made up for it. Thanks!"}
{"text":"i ordered delivery from this location and got food poisoning from their chicken wings. Me and my husband got wings with mac and cheese and not even 3 hours after eating we are both in the bathroom. Never would of expected this from a known restaurant. very disappointed"}
{"text":"We had such a terrible experience at this location tonight. First of all the waitress, Danielle, sat down next to my son on his tiny chair  while she was taking our orders. He is an 8 year old who has severe social anxiety and was very uncomfortable the entire time she sat there. She took our order and asked if we wanted to her to bring it as it's made or if we wanted it all out at one time. We asked her to bring it all out at once, because otherwise whoever has their food first ends up just waiting for everyone else as the food gets cold. We got one kids food item and one basket of wings out at least 10 minutes prior to anyone else. My mother in law proceeded to let the waitress know that we had asked for everything to come out at once because, now this one persons food is getting cold. The waitress said, \" this is Buffalo Wild Wings, that's not how it works. We bring it out when it's made.\" Right, but you asked us and we Told you. \"That's not how it works. I can bring a manager out to talk to if that's what you want.\" We were just letting you know this is how we feel. \"Let me just bring a manager out because this is how it is.\" Ok sure. Manager comes out and barely apologizes and says he'll check on the food. Less than a minute later, the food comes out. Hmmm wonder if it was sitting back there for a while? No offer to comp or coming back to make sure everything's okay? Bad management too. Then my mother in law orders a refill on her drink. 5-10 minutes go by and the drink still isn't there. The waitress stops and she tells her that she has been waiting. \"Honey, this is how it works. I put in the order and they bring it out to you.\" She says with an attitude. And walks away. Wtf! Less than a minute later she magically appears with my mils drinks. Once again we are left to wonder if it was sitting there,forgotten. We get the bill and my Mil puts the primary phone number for their rewards (because they do frequent bww quite often, but usually at Goodyear where the service is much better) and the waitress whispers in her ear that she should have her own bww reward account because that meal was worth a lot of points. It was very offensive to both her and her fiancée. Lastly, she asks us if we need boxes for our orders and then asks us what sizes we need and she says \"I'll bring two large and one small, for sh*ts and giggles\" in front of my 7 and 8 year old, without any regard to how absolutely inappropriate that was.  While we were leaving we see her walking quickly with the manager to smoke a cigarette.. which makes sense on why he wasn't that upset that she had screwed up tonight. We won't be back to this location until you can get your management and staff up to par with customer service. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday night with my family for some dinner and didn't even know the Ufc was on that night. Great bonus and on all the big screens.   Food: We ordered the cheese curds for our appetizer and they were great, the portion size was fairly small for almost $7. Not worth the price in my opinion. I got the 6 piece chicken fingers with fries and as usual they were good. The sauces are always great. Always get multiple. Tried the Thai curry, mild, and some Jamaican one. All were delicious. My wife got the Buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delicious. The chicken was also cooked perfect with the right amount of crisp. I stole a couple bites. My daughter also got ice cream. Plain vanilla with chocolate syrup. Nothing special but she loved it and only $1.   Drinks: I ordered a Jack with coke and a Captain with coke. Both had good flavor but tasted a little on the light side. Maybe because of fight night. Everytime there is an event they run out of the right glass ware. I get my Jack and coke in a cocktail glass. Might throw the pour and mix ratio off?  My wife got Malibu mixed with some juices, fruity woman drink but she loved it.  Staff: The staff were amazing. A lot of new faces. The last two times we have been everything was 10 times better than before. They are all nice and professional. They are amazing with kids! My daughter wanted all of their attention and we usually had 2-3 workers at our table playing with her and high fiving as they walked by. I also heard they got new management. Shout out to Captain Rob, we will be there for a Monday night soon.  Thank you to everyone for making an average sports bar dinner into an entertaining night."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab some wings or a burger.  It's filled with TV's and they have a fun trivia game you can play at your table.  As the name implies, it has a full bar.  I had an order of mild boneless wings, and a \"Big Jack Daddy Burger\", which is a burger with pulled pork, bacon and onion rings.  The food was really good.    Buffalo's is also open 24 hours, so it's a nice late night choice for the munchies."}
{"text":"It was packed so I found a seat outside. After being ignored for half an hour. I called in and they told me to get stamped or no service. I went across the street to HOOTERS where the screens are in HD and the service is 500% better.   I walked across to HOOTERS so I gladly occupied BWW'S parking space. Stay at HOOTERS  for football heaven!!  Good riddance BWWS. No more. !"}
{"text":"This Tempe outpost of Buffalo Wild Wings is their 700th store. Just about 3 blocks from the Rural/University train station, it's a very convienent location to access via transit. They do offer complimentary surface parking which is something that cannot be said for downtown Tempe locations.   The atmosphere is exactly the same as every other BWW. Over the top TV visual stimulation, bright white lights that would blind you if you looked into them, and a ridiculous amount of people in the restaurant at all times. I asked for one of the TVs to be tuned to the Diamondbacks game, and after trying to find it for 15 minutes, they put it on a small TV because the big one was carrying a U of A v. Iowa football game. Look, not only is this game a 4 days old replay, but you're in ASU territory so please put the LIVE broadcast of the HOME team on the big television. They refused. About 5 minutes later, another bar patron asked that same TV showing football to be changed to Cubs v. Giants, and there was no hesitation on their part to get this done. I was a little befuddled.   The food is shy of average. When I go to a place that specializes in buffalo wings, give me some decent buffalo wings. These things are tiny, overcooked, balls of grease. I tried the garlic parmesan, spicy garlic, medium, and asian zing sauces. The garlic parmesan was kind of gross, the asian zing was identical to the bottle of Mae Ploy sweet and spicy glaze I have in my refrigerator. The other two were fine sauces, but the meat portions and quality were crap.   On my visit, they had just opened two days prior so I'll cut them slack on the mishaps, which were plentiful, on the bartender/servers part. I won't however, write a review without mentioning the behavior of the managerial staff. Is this amateur hour? The TWO MANAGERS got out a book of ID cards which supposedly had every ID in the country with pictures and ways to tell if it's fake. Every out of state ID they saw, they referenced the book. What I have to ask is if they are managers of a big time chain restaurant, shouldn't they have seen an ID or two in their day? Don't they have a history of working in bars/restaurants? Shouldn't they have carded people in the past? I then watched them brushing their teeth behind the bar. Lost my damn appetite. The employees aren't being trained quickly because the management team is a bunch of buffoons.  FYI, if you recently turned 21 and have a vertical ID, don't go here because they won't take it. Someone needs to tell them they are by a college campus. I watched at least a dozen people be turned down for drinks because of the vertical ID."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last night.  It was her first time to eat at a Buffalo Wild Wings.  I've eaten at other locations a couple of times in the past 5-7 years.  The positive...  It's clean.  The service is good.  Lots of televisions with a lot of different games on.  Great atmosphere.  The negative...  The food isn't very good.  I ordered a build-your-own grilled chicken sandwich with everything on it.  It was very bland.  The honey mustard sauce is very watery without much taste.  We didn't order any wings because at $11.99 for 10 wings is a bit steep.  My wife ordered a salad.  The thing that made no sense was the card on the center of the table.  Restaurants usually use these cards to advertise something or promote a menu item.  But the card in the center of the table was communicating a handful of sauces that Buffalo Wild Wings no longer offers and has permanently retired.   How is that supposed to make me excited to eat there that they have sauce flavors that they want me to know that they'll never serve again.  Strange."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant with my friend. Surprisingly...the occupancy on a Friday night was approximately 60% full. The restaurant was clean and the staff was good. The food came out quick and the food was good. Good spot"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited this location on Friday. We hadn't eaten dinner the night prior so we were really looking forward to a great lunch here. We sat at the bar and ordered a drink. My friend (male) went to the restroom and saw an employee walk out of the stall and instead of him washing his hands he proceeded to walk out. We were keeping an eye out to see if he was serving anyone food in our section. THANKFULLY he wasn't on the bar side or else we would've walked out. Turns out we see him and continue to watch him to see what his role was. He didn't handle any food, thankfully, but did see him with a rag to wipe down tables. At this point we discussed speaking with the manager, but were scared our food would be messed with. So we waited until after our meal to discuss it with the manager who's name was Angie. We spoke with her after our meal to address the situation with her. We were again disgusted with the way she handled it. Her first reaction was eww, then proceeded to say ok I'll talk to him. I have been in the rest. industry for over ten years and was surprised we didn't get an apology or a, this is not how we conduct business here and our crew is told to be sanitary. I feel bad for the people who's tables he wiped down. I don't see Buffalo Wild Wings the same anymore. Disgusting"}
{"text":"I come to this Bww's quite frequently due to its proximity to mine and my friends houses. Sadly as much as we come here nothing ever just happens right for us here. The service is fine but usually our wings are somehow child's sized or over-done or under sauced. It's quite saddening because we still come here if only because it's so close to where we live. Although those desserts that taste like they're from a box in the freezer never fail to makes us crave this Bww either!"}
{"text":"What great service! Valerie was our server and she was excellent! We waited and wanted for nothing! We came in for lunch and ordered appetizers drinks and lunch. The moscato sangria was wonderful. Our food showed up at the table quickly! Between Valerie, the other server and the managers, everyone checked on us! You could tell it was a great team working together! I'm going to start frequenting this place more often simply because the SERVICE was AMAZING!   Don't forget they have tons and tons of tvs! You could basically sit anywhere and watch whatever you want! This is a great spot to watch the games."}
{"text":"Food was so so service slow. Servers don't pay attention. God awful ugly waitresses. Annoying crowd and unfriendly atmosphere is probably due to the demographic of the area. Buffalo chicken sandwich was ok. Side of fries should be bigger. Wouldn't recommend this location. The Chandler location was much better."}
{"text":"Ive been too many bww all over the U.S. and this 1 is the Worse ive ever been too!!! They never bring fresh wings EVER, They must cook them ahead of time and leave them under a lamp....I even tell them ahead of time to make sure theyre fresh.....Yeh right! They dont give a rats tail....If you come here you will be seriously dissapointed unless your tastebuds are as dead as their wings! Better off cooking your own! Florence,Sc BWW cooks fresh wings and They have great service! This BWW gives all the good ones a bad name"}
{"text":"Free wireless and their sports bar are what lured us to this 24-hour neighborhood joint in Centennial Hills.    Great place to watch games.....and the only place nearby where I could watch NHL playoffs.  With 18 screens around the bar, and 22 monitors in the dining room area, I had the pleasure of watching some NBA and UFC as well.  They even have two more monitors in the mens bathroom (over the urinals), so I never would miss a goal or powerplay.  Not sure if there were screens inside the women's, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did!  After a few visits, I've become a fan of their bar food as well.  With 14 \"smilin to screamin\" different sauces, we've only had four so far.   Their boneless wings were satisfying with their medium sauce.  But their honey BBQ sauce made their ribs and wings combo better than average.  Our last visit involved their mango habanero sauce on their tender, juicy ribs and perfectly cooked wings.  This screamin sauce (third from their hottest) had a nice flavor and kick to it.  Their hot BBQ sauce went well with the pulled pork slammers.  The pork was a little dry but full of flavor. For desserts, we've had the chocolate cake and cinnamon bites, which I highly recommend after the spices.  Both were served with ice cream, and were very refreshing.     This place is as good as it gets with excellent service, great atmosphere, and phenomenal food!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and the food is always good. Tonight, our server Jackie was amazing. She was extremely busy for happy hour, but did a great job staying on top of everything with a smile. If you come in you should ask for her. Top notch!"}
{"text":"Great hot wings I recommend this place if your trying to get a great snack or family meal. My personal favorite is their chicken wraps or chicken burgers. The service is also amazing over there, better than most."}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings is a mixed bag of highs and lows.  I went in to watch some March Madness basketball on a Thursday night, and the place was about 1/4 full (if that).  I went right for one of the self seating high tops to take in some college basketball excitement.  The restaurant itself seems very new and has a modern look.  It is easily the nicest BWW I've ever been inside, however, I was hoping for a little more exciting of an atmosphere for game watching.  The place just felt way too quiet, and is a far cry from the energy you'll find in a bar closer to Old Town.  The food was decent, and is what you would expect from BDubs.  I had a small size of traditional Mild wings and they were perfectly fine.  I'm a pretty huge wimp when it comes to spice levels so these were plenty hot for me!  Easily the biggest complaint I have concerns the service.  The place just felt empty, and at 1/4 capacity, the service was unacceptably slow and disorganized.  It took about 10 minutes for a server to come over, and  another 15-20 before I got my drink order.  Of course, there was a table that came in 15 minutes after me, ordered, and got all their drinks first - one of the largest annoyances for me at any restaurant.  The food took a similarly long time.  If the place was busier, I'd be happy to give them some leeway, but in this case, it was very frustrating.  It's unlikely I'll be back soon, there are just too many other good places to watch a game in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We came with a party of 20 and they managed to find use a seat within 10 minutes.   The food was really good and I loved the waitress that we had. She got all of our orders correctly and our refills kept on coming.   Overall I'd have to give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"The Spicy Garlic wings are the ONLY reason I gave this place 2 stars.  The service is terrible!!!  I have been here several times over the last couple of months and every time it is the same thing. i have to wait on the servers for 15-20 minutes to place my order and even then i have to flag them down.  The majority of people there don't even look happy to work there.  If you're not then don't!  The drinks are terrible too, stick with beer."}
{"text":"I love the Bourbon Honey Mustard wings and Asian Zing. But most all the flavors over tasted have been great. The atmosphere is awesome as well!"}
{"text":"The wings were good.  the choice of sauces is a nice change of pace from say Hooter's.  It seems like a nice place to watch the game, whichever game that might.  They're also open 24 hours, why I don't know, but this is Vegas, and everyone loves where they can drink, smoke and play video poker.."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is a consistent experience.  I find the food to be solid.  Not the best I've ever had, but certainly not bad.  The wings are good and the sandwiches will fill you up.  My latest crave there is the chicken salad.  I'll get breaded or grilled, depending on my mood, and always have it tossed with something fun.  Last night was \"Hot BBQ\".  Throw some ranch dressing in there and let the flavors socialize.  YUM!  It's a filling meal and, because it's a salad, I don't have to hate myself in the morning.  Service is always good and friendly.    We used to draft fantasy football leagues at various Buffalo Wild Wings in the area every year, but they keep changing their promotion.  It started with \"$100 of gift certificates\".  They let us use that on draft day, which was great - we lived like kings and everyone won.  Then it was \"here's your $100, but it's for future use\".  Fine, so we came back for an after-season party.  Good enough.  The last time there it was ten $10 \"certificates\" (minimum $25 purchase, one per visit).  Huh?  So, we won't be drafting there anymore - they keep dumbing down the promotion like they don't want that business...  but I digress.  This location was clean, the staff were friendly and fast, and the food was good."}
{"text":"Good, standard BWW. Love that they are open 24 hours and have a late night happy hour!"}
{"text":"The fried pickles was AMAZING! I tried some different Wing flavors this time - Thai curry, salt & vinegar . I actually really enjoyed them. They tasted super yummy! I also got lemon pepper it was okay I definitely need them to spice up those lemon pepper wings they tasted really bland. But overall the service was great. The waitress did a good job and made sure our drinks was refilled in a timely matter."}
{"text":"I'm being kind with this rating simply because the service was actually very good when we were there, and because it was clean. We went for an early lunch, so that might have played a role.   The chips were decent. As far as the wings go, they can be described in one word: blah. I'd rather get wings from Publix and watch one game on one TV than get wings at Buffalo Wild Wings and watch several games on dozens of TVs."}
{"text":"The worst service I have had in a long time..!! I haven't been to one of these stores in ages..but the service used to be relatively good. But not on this Tuesday evening.  The waiter took our drink and appetizer order but the drinks (ice tea) had no spoon, no straw and no sweet and low or sugar or anything. Another nice blond waitress went and got that for us. The Mexican corn appetizer was tasty but we had no plate or silverware or anything to eat it with. The blond waitress brought the wings but we still had no plates or silverware. The blond waitress brought it. We also did not get our Blue Cheese and ranch dressing or our carrots and celery. Also the blond waitress from the other section brought it..!! I noticed the couple next to us ordered beers but got tired of waiting for the guy to come get their order so they left..! It took forever to get the check but he finally brought it..!! I tried to give the tip to the blond waitress because she did all the work but she said she couldn't take it. Don't think I'm gonna be back any time soon..!! Plenty of good places to eat in Vegas..!"}
{"text":"I used to really like Bdubs, but I've noticed the service has been going down, while the music has been going up. It doesn't take long for you to be seated, but it does take long for your server to come to you. Once or twice, I would understand. This has become a regular thing for this location unfortunately.  With the loud music, it's annoying to wait that long and not be able to hear the person sitting across for you. Captains aren't that great anymore, they interrupt the table mostly.   I used to be a regular, and go once a week for lunch. I now go about once a month, because I still like the food. Fried pickles, cheese curds, and the wings are still good. Most of the people serving the food, unfortunately, are not that good."}
{"text":"I come here with the girl I nanny usually about 3 times a month. We usually visit on a time crunch-- she gets out of school, it takes us until around 4:15 to get to BWW and then we need to leave by 4:45-5:00 to get to our next destination on time. Every single time we've been here, we've gotten or requested the waiter Stephen and he is great! We let him know we are in a crunch and need food ASAP, and he and the cooks always get us our food within 12 minutes or less. (We don't order anything complicated, but ordering a similar meal at the Chili's across the street has taken over 30 minutes.) Stephen is also very patient as the girl I nanny is autistic and sometimes has a hard time explaining if she wants to try something different... And when I take my 4 year old daughter, he is very kind and let's her order even though she is sometimes a little hard to understand ;-)  We usually get the flavored lemonades. If you haven't tried the huckleberry or mango lemonade, you MUST try them! This location has always appeared very clean and the staff seems to be really nice."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings in Arizona. The place gets pretty packed during high profile sporting games, so its a fun environment for people who love the energy.  I'm a huge fan of the boneless wings. BBQ Hot and the Caribbean Jerk are my personal faves, but with over 15 types of sauces to choose from, you be the judge"}
{"text":"We used to love coming here, and since we live basically right across the street, we have and would continue giving them tons of business. But this last time we visited was kind of unacceptable. My boyfriend ate absolute raw chicken (boneless wings), the manager and waiter apologized, which was nice, but they only took off my boyfriend's meal and a $5 coupon we had. They didn't take off my chicken wings from the bill. As a manager, I would've absolutely AT LEAST comped (taken off) any and all chicken involved with the bill. They only took off the boneless wings he was eating because he mentioned it. And on top of that, they gave us two $5 coupons off for our next visit. It's like they gave us two extra times we could potentially get salmonella, haha. Even though the situation in itself is not that big of a deal, and even though they comped us a little and apologized, I, personally, would have comped the entirety of the bill. Since they didn't acknowledge this as big of a deal as it is (I'm in the medical field and my boyfriend is trained in food safety so it's a big deal to us, as it should be), we will not be returning. They have lost our business (which we have given a couple times a week for the past year and the upcoming 5+ years), and it's so sad because we truly like coming here. It's just that they handled this so poorly. I'm writing a review so that they know to please comp the next bill they give out to someone in case it's identified as raw chicken for someone else. Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wild Wings . I just wish they had bigger restaurants with more booths and two kitchens . There always crazy busy but so crispy and good . And there beers are always cold ."}
{"text":"I do enjoy their .45 cent wing Tuesdays and their easy convenient to-go area, but otherwise his place is pretty low on the chicken wing food chain!   *Chicken wings taste as they've been fried ahead of time and sitting around in a warming drawer. Explains why they are chewy, tough, and dry.  *Wings are TINY. Somehow they find the tiniest chickens on earth.  I do love their new dry rubs - in particular the salt & vinegar. Despite this, I prefer sticking to Mom and Pop type places with bigger wings at a lower price. Hard to justify giving your money to a chain with so many better options in this city!"}
{"text":"I like Buffalo Wild Wings personally but they always mess up my order countless times I've asked for no type of mustard in the mini corn dogs as I am allergic and I always get it. It's ridiculous."}
{"text":"service was ok, food was really good. love the cheese sampler appetizer , I like all their wing flavors..my favorites are lemon pepper and spicy garlic. The strawberry lemonade is really good and the dessert nachos is a must try.."}
{"text":"Used to kind of enjoy coming here because I could get a beer / order to go food / get out quickly. Service is definitely lacking. I consistently leave 25-30% tips, but get my check and credit card tossed in front of me with no \"thank you\" no \"thanks for coming\". Very dissatisfied. Not happy with management either. I have been to this location a minimum of 35 times and have never had a positive interaction with a member of management. One manager almost tries to stare me down when I come in and doesn't say a word to me. Just kinda stares at me. I guess I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars really. I'm not a fan of BWW ok, I come here when I'm forced to, but this would be the only location I enjoy because the service and quality of food is consistent. I only enjoy fried pickles and tall chilled IPA beers - this place gets it right every time. I did however recently try their Buffalo Blue burger and alright I'll admit- it was good, plus you can substitute for potato wedges.. so there's the half star. I still think Bdubbs is overpriced."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of BWW to begin with, it's pricey, it's loud, and their boneless wings are dry. But the hubbs LOVEs this place, so sometimes I have to pretend I love it too. This location is a little worse than the location off Las Vegas Blvd. they don't have the same IPA selection and don't make the fried pickles the same either, and that's about all I enjoy. Service is normal, crowd is about the same. My top would be stick to beer, fries, and regular wings if you MUST come here to eat."}
{"text":"I like Buffalo Wild Wings food okay, they're wings are pretty good. To be honest I think I could find cheaper elsewhere that are also better. Went with a group of 5, it must've taken them over half an hour to bring our food out. Either way, we were there for almost two hours and it did not take us long to eat wings. I got the Nacho burger with fries, the fries were classic fries, crispy and right amount of saltiness. Burger was pretty good too, nothing special. I got bone-in dry rub chipotle barbecue wings, the chicken wasn't very tender but the seasoning was great, very flavorful, slightly spicy, just a hint of barbecue. Our waitress came pretty scarcely to our table, we had to flag down a busser to get our water refilled, and that was like an hour into our time there. Mostly rating two stars for minimal service, the time t took for our food to cook and I'd expect better for the price."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice.  Probably never again for real chicken wings, but their chicken nuggets called \"boneless wings\" are decent.  First time i went for takeaway they totally forgot all dipping sauces.  Seriously get home with chicken wings and go for some ranch and blue cheese and your stuck with nada.... not cool.  On top of that the actual chicken wings that I bought were way over cooked to the point that the chicken skin was rock hard crunchy, and the chicken inside was dry.  Second time the service was much better in that they checked the bag with me standing there and the order had everything including dipping sauces.  Then i got home and i went to take a bite of a chicken wing and damn near broke a fricken tooth.  Skin fried til it was rock hard, meat reminded me of eating squid tentacles (which are meant to be dense and hard), and after about 5 wings I was like nope.  What is odd, the boneless chicken nuggets my wife and the kids got... perfectly fine and tender, actually really good.  I may go to this place for chicken nuggets, but this sure as heck isn't a wing place."}
{"text":"Wing stop is a chain, quick eatery. It's not fine dining and I think most of us are okay with that fact. As a fan of cheap eats, I only come to B-dubs, as it is affectionally called, on Tuesday and Thursdays for wing specials. This visit was $0.65 traditional wing day. Fast ordering, fast eating, and a tidy check. The location in Savoy is always just packed enough and just loud enough to do well for itself. Usually you can come here to watch some sports or have a drink but it's not a den of solitude. It gets pretty noisy. Overall, not a bad joint. It's exactly what you would expect."}
{"text":"Alright so I was drunk and just rudely awakened to come here and eat against my free will. On a rainy night we came here on a mission to get fat. I'm not a huge fan of BWW SD so I was like ugh..   4 stars for food. They gave us extra wings or they charged us extra and we didn't even look at the bill.  Upon entering at around 11pm we were told bar seat only. At the bar she said we couldn't sit here if we weren't 21. Then wth???? Why are you open 24/7 if those under 21 can not dine here when there are enough staff but they just don't want to sit tables?!? HOW LAZY!!!!  I was extremely rude to the bartender when she said we couldn't sit here and had to order Togo and she kept her composure. I said to her \"WELL IF WE CANT SIT HERE AND THEY SAID WE CAN ONLY SIT AT THE BAR THEN WHAT?????!!!!!\"  Hangry... not her fault but she was nice and took our Togo order. Although I am of age to drink, I just didn't want to show my ID because I didn't want to drink.  Wings were cooked right all flats extra crispy extra saucy too. Fries were fine with Queso cheese they were delicious.   4/5 food 2/5 lazy staff 3/5 bartender 1/5 for being BWW (lol jk)"}
{"text":"VERY VERY VERY slooooooooowwwwwww service. Came in on a Tuesday around 4pm. WAS NOT BUSY. The server had 4 tables including mine. A different person brought my food and asked me if she could get me anything else I asked for extra sauce, never got it. I was done with my food when the server finally came back around. She had about 4 tables!!!! I still tipped 22% because I'm a server and only because the wings are always good not because of the service."}
{"text":"I love Bdubs but this particular location was a bit of a disappointment. I placed a phone order for pick up and when my coworker and I got our food, it wasn't to up to par. My coworker got the Buffalo Wrap which he said was good but the fries were stale and a bit undercooked. My order was simple; snack size, Buffalo dry rub, extra crispy. But instead, I got it extra wet and as a result, my wings were so spicy! I mean, I love spicy food by this one was just unbearable to the point where my mouth was on fire and I kid you not, I may have cried like a baby lol. Anyway, I'm still a big fan of Bdubs but not this particular location, I'd most likely avoid this location due to the inconsistency and lack of good quality."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Buffalo Wild Wings for the first time yesterday. The boneless hot wings were mighty tasty. They also offer a remarkable selection of wing sauces from garlic to habenero. The atmosphere is full on  \"sports bar\" - I can imagine it gets really packed in here on game days."}
{"text":"This is an above average sports bar chain with fantastic chicken wings. I like stopping here for lunch occasionally, I don't know if I'd ever bother late night."}
{"text":"**********Found a 24 hour buffalo wild wings!**********  The place is all tinted up for whatever reason maybe to keep out the sun however its open at yes 4 am in the morning when we came back from clubbing. It's probably the smallest bww I've been to.  When you walk into buffalo wild wings you expect to smell the aroma of  many different spiced wings, however here our nostrils was met with a strong foul odor known as the sewage pipe. It reeked throughout the restaurant, they used a fan to blow out the smell out the back door.   Anyhow after that stinky issue we order our wings. I must say the wings here they don't go cheap on the sauce! Usually the Mango Habanero is not as hot but the Sauce here gave my lips/tongue a burning sensation.   So for those wondering if there is a 24 hour buffalo wild wings out there in Vegas. Well here it is!"}
{"text":"finally found a dish i like a bws.  i get the honey mustard salad which is tasty.  since my husband is a fan of bws i'll be back."}
{"text":"If you're lookin for some heat in your wings, go with the habanero mango. Wear some chapstick. They really are hot. They are also sticky and really sweet, which aids in determining whether that back tooth has a cavity or not. You'll know immediately.  We had no problems with our server in the bar area; which seems to be all waiters. The waitresses all seem to service the front dining area...that's probably to keep them from getting hit on by inebriated patrons every 2 seconds. Makes sense.  Beer prices aren't too bad, and they have a passable selection of crafts. They seem to lean towards Four Peaks for local stuff. I went with the Goose Island 312 since it was hot as blazes that day.  Wings are ridiculously priced. That's not just here, its everywhere! Note that when you order wings, that's what you get. So don't feel left out when they arrive sans carrots and celery. You'd think for the price of wings these days - companies could \"toss you a bone\" and throw in a few veggie sticks to help you finish off your bleu cheese or ranch.  Oh, I almost forgot - the TVs are all nicely calibrated for sports viewing. The saturation and contrast are cranked up nicely without being overbearing. Perfect for sports, but I wouldn't want to watch a Scorsese flick that way.. You can also play trivia and poker on some of the TVs."}
{"text":"The service is very very slow. The server is on her first rotation by herself with a group of 17, WTF. The food was cold, no other server or manager came to help her out. I finally had to complain after 1 1/2 hours to the manager. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Man I love this place! Awesome service, quick seating, and great wings of course. I usually go out of my way to go to this Buffalo Wild Wings location! You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was happy when this location opened cause I enjoy a lot of the other locations, although, this place definitely needs to work out those new restaurant kinks first before I will find myself visiting again.  The food was good as usual, exactly what I expected from visiting the other locations. Good wings, wraps, sauces, etc. Prices are decent, great happy hour, etc. No complaints in any of those departments. Basically the food alone and the great atmosphere gives this place 3 stars.  However, when it comes to the service, well, that is also why I am only giving this place three stars. The service is slow, everyone seems confused, and no one seems to be able to remember something more than 10 seconds. We sat outside cause it was a beautiful day weatherwise, everyone else seemed to agree cause the inside was fairly empty. There was plenty of staff, but it still took way too long to even be greeted with a drink order, then the drinks took a while on top of that. Once we ordered the food, it did come quickly, but one meal was missing it's side, and when we asked for extra ranch, that took about 15 more minutes to get. The missing side didn't even show up till everyone was done eating, which was also after reminding our waitress two more times about it.   I will probably visit this place again, but not anytime soon. Just be warned, if you plan on going here, the service is not up to par yet with the other B-Dub locations in the valley."}
{"text":"this was the worst experience I've ever had at a place that calls themselves a bar!! we went in and tried to to order shots and they told us shots or drinks not both . and the food we ordered tasted like salt and grease!!!"}
{"text":"I took my sister here for her 20th birthday and ordered spinach dip 40 wings and tacos.   The spinach dip was GROSS !!!! It tasted like they re heat it in a microwave it was burnt at the bottom of the cup...  I asked for the dish to be removed and to be removed off the check. The server acted as if I was crazy. No manager ever stopped by to see how our table was doing after the complaint. Smh then she didn't even get the item took off the bill Costumer service here sucks"}
{"text":"Great food came in a was immediately waited on and the wait time for food arrival was phenomenal  Food tasted great and couldnt of asked for it to be better then it already was  Will be returning asap  Great customer service"}
{"text":"Usually every time I come to this place the people that work here seem like they hate their lives.  They aren't friendly and they always seem irritated that they have to work,  take an order ect. But this visit was actually decnt. Jessica rabbit I believe her name was really good,  always checking on us and making sure our drinks were filled the entire time. And always  had a smile on her face.  Thanks Jessica for making this visit a good one"}
{"text":"This place is just your typical Bdubs. Nothing special, nothing that makes it stand out.   Of course, we had to order the fried pickles because i have some sort of pickle obsession. The pickles are  cornmeal-breaded dill pickle slices fried and served with what I think was a southwestern ranch dressing.  I usually order my wings drowning in either parm garlic, or the wild sauce. Both are great choices in my book. I usually go with traditional wings though, don't see the point in ordering what are pretty much chicken nuggets.   I absolutely always somehow end up with a beer when i am here. It usually tends to be whatever they have as special at that point (especially if I have never had it before).   Two huge drawbacks with this place though: The service and the fact that it seems to always be a mess here.  In all the times that I have been to this location, the service sucks. They are rude and tend to just do their own thing. There has been a few times where I have waiting a good 15 minutes for a beer. And forget about them coming to see how you are doing during the meal.  I think the biggest complaint for me is that the place is always a mess. There is usually napkins all over the place and a lot of the tables tend to sit dirty for a long period of time."}
{"text":"Popped in last night on my way home to pick up some to-go food and grab a quick drink. Not a place I typically go, but it was convenient at the moment. The bartender was nice, but it took almost 40 minutes to get my food. Flagged down a manager to ask if 40 minute ticket times were normal for a restaurant that was only about half full, but he didn't seem to care. You'd think after speaking to him he'd run right back to the kitchen to check on my food, but no, just continued to stand there. I then brought it up to the bartender who had to then leave the bar to check on my food. I ordered boneless wings and fries. Not something that should take 40 minutes. Get home to find my fries ice cold, and regular wings, not boneless. Disappointed to say the least. I'll inconvenience myself in the future."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location. I must say,  i was not impressed at all. It took forever for our drink orders to be taken, and just as long to get our meal.   By the time my wife got her cheese fries, they had gotten cold and the cheese had congealed. Other than that the meal was decent. The onion rings were very good though, but not good enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"Great wings but nothing out of the ordinary. I rarely ever go and if I do, it would be on Tuesday during their wing specials. I notice it being busy during their wing Tuesdays, boneless chicken Thursdays, and during sporting events. Going here during the time of a sporting event isn't fun unless you want to wait a long time for a table. Folks are usually at their tables until the end of the game.  My must try flavors are parmesan garlic, lemon pepper, and Asian zing."}
{"text":"This review is for TODAY'S experience. I am a Blazin' Rewards Member and absolutely LOVE BWW, but today was something else. Normally at this location, my family and I sit in the dining area and usually have Jasmine or Amanda as our servers and have a WONDERFUL experience.   Food at BWW is for the most part always great. Understandably, if gets busy especially during game times little things can get missed.   Today I came with a couple of co-workers on our lunch break, arrived at 10:05AM dining room was not open yet so we proceeded to the bar where only 1 other table was taken. Elijah said hello from across the room, and he would be right with us.  He came over and asked for ID's and we tried to start ordering, since we're on a short schedule and we're regulars, we already know what we want. He took only our drink orders and said he would be back. 10:15ish he finally came back to take our order. During the wait for the food, we witnessed a lady try to make a takeout order with him and ended up walking out because she wasn't helped in a timely manner, listened to our server complain that he's getting stares from other customers because they have not been helped yet, and his words were, \"It's not my fault they decided to sit in the bar instead of the dining room where servers are available to help them out.\" WHAT?! I mean we all talk crap. Anyways 10:43 our food FINALLY arrives at this point we asked for checks and to-go boxes since we had no time left to even eat there.   I took a bite of one of my wings, and automatically knew that my order was wrong. I let him know and he took my order back to the kitchen and asked them to change it. Instead of changing it, I was told that my order is actually correct and labeled correctly. (I ordered the BBQ mashup with Mango Habanero and BBQ Sauce.) The wings were way too spicy, which is why I stopped ordering Mango Habanero in the first place. I was given the option to change my order, \"but it will take about as long as it took to get to you in the first place.\" ANOTHER fail, today I just couldn't win.   Unfortunately, I did not have time to speak to a manager right then and there - so I took the number as I walked out and dialed on the way out. The young lady that answered knew exactly who I was, (she witnessed the whole situation) and said she would pass along the info to the manager and encouraged me to call back at 2 pm. At the moment all of the managers were running around and did not have a second to talk.   UPDATE; I called at 2, still no one available. I called 2 days later still nothing. 18 days and still no response from anyone."}
{"text":"They got pretty good dishes here. I have been here numerous times, and I have never had any bad experiences personally. I have had on one occasion had my boneless wings overcooked, but never undercooked.  I love the Teriyaki Wing sauce they have, and the Honey BBQ is great too. Another interesting idea is the Salt N Vinegar fries. The Fish Tacos, and burger I had was pretty good too. There have been a couple occasions where the staff didn't know answers to questions I had (but realistically new people aren't going to know everything). Overall I would definitely be coming back, and I love it here!"}
{"text":"Wings are above average, staff is friendly and attentive. The restaurant is kept clean and organized. The fries with queso are must try!"}
{"text":"Decent food and service. The medium buffalo and honey BBQ wings are my favorite flavors. From the appetizers, I really like the fries with queso."}
{"text":"This place has improved immensely since when it first opened.  The cooks seem to have finally learned how to cook, and the waitstaff seems a bit more competent as well.  Mozzarella sticks were good and the Southwest bites were tasty.  Not sure what it is about their wing sauce (buffalo) but my stomach is always in knots the next day... I might not consider myself a wing aficionado, but Im probably pretty close and I havent had the side effects I get when I eat here anywhere else.  And it happens every time I eat their wings.  They do taste decent, just not sure if the product is worth the price anymore (and im not talking $$).  Best things about B dubs = LOTS of tv's, they get UFC ppv's, they have most football games and other sports on at least one tv.  Decent selection of beers, and they have games like golden tee and that trivia game to play if theres nothing on tv"}
{"text":"The biggest screens of all bdubs in Las Vegas I believe. And very accommodating for what you want to watch, they'll try and please you. I only hang in the bar area because it's the fastest way to get in and get out. I don't have anything to say about the restaurant section."}
{"text":"I walked in for a pick up order. The lady who greeted me was super sweet and attentive. She signed me up for the rewards program then went on break. I was on my lunch break at work and I only had 30 minutes to get my food and eat it. The group of hostesses and servers who took over after she left made it seem like they had no idea what they were doing. It was pretty slow and I still ended up waiting 45 minutes on my food with was ready 10 minutes after. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Always good, always FUN.   I thought the server was a little snooty at first,  but she ended up very nice and cool. Jennifer (server) gave me an extra drink because I was super thirsty.  The food was grrrreat of course.  I had lots of food to take home."}
{"text":"Tuesday is $.60 wing day.  That's when  to come to this place.  It's large, the staff is competent, they have a patio, plenty of tv's if you aren't a conversationalist, the wings are good and they have maybe 30 flavors, so you should find a variety that pleases. As I perused the menu, it struck me that except for a handful of luncheon specials, printed on a stand-alone menu supplement, one would be hardpresssed to get out of this place for lunch for under $10.00 for the entree, (sandwich) plus beverage and any sides in which one might have interest; so let's say $15.00 plus tip. I dunno, seems to me there are a plethora of sports bars out there that offer the same or more for less, but not everybody looks at the price column when they dine. \"Nuff said!"}
{"text":"The service is bad,my wife ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which was very fatty tasting couldn't even finish her first bite. She did get another dinner replaced but the manager never came out to apologize. I will never go back to that disappointed."}
{"text":"You will never get good service here. It doesn't matter where you sit or with who. Traditionally bad at every location though. Food is below average, even compared to other BWW. The only thing the company has left riding for them would be their sauces."}
{"text":"This is a pretty awesome Bdubs! Things have drastically changed since I last worked at a Bdubs in 2009. The restaurant layout has become more open and brighter- this location is no exception! I was told this particular restaurant is more fancy than most in the Valley due to its north Scottsdale location & the tendency for \"fancy crowds\" on the weekend per one of my fellow lunchtime friends.  We've come a few times for lunch across the last few months and have experienced consistent high-quality service. We get a preference for seating and normally are taken right away to the available table. Within a minute our servers have greeted us and taken a drink order. Each time as well we are asked if we're at lunch, which I believe is why our food doesn't take terribly long to cook. I'm really happy they have a lunch menu- a snack-size boneless wing & wedges is perfect! Honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu though- I tried just about everything during my tenure hostessing. If wings aren't your deal, then gotta go with a salad!"}
{"text":"Marginal. Ordered EXTRA crospy bone-in wings. Had to send back. New order was better. Wings were marginal. I'll admit. I grew up in Upstate New York were wings were invented so the bar is HIGH. Next time I'll try boneless. Bartender was a sweety but she was too busy to service the bar and pour drinks for a full restaurant. Restaurant needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"Best service I have had at a Buffalo Wild Wings in a while! It was sugar bowl game day and we completely forgot so when we got there it was extremely crowded but they still managed to sit us immediately in the bar area. Our server was Jenn who was very attentive! Our guest service manager was Jeremy and he was so awesome! We adored him he was so nice and brought us a great beer sample. The food was awesome, beer was awesome and ticket times were short! Will for sure be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service went in asked for a booth didn't mind waiting, after 10mins the hostess seats another couple who came in after us in the only booth. The response we got was we'll seat you next, seriously just sat them easy oh hey we messed up we sat you at the wrong table please move easy but nope so I will not be back every if they can't do the simplest task of managing there tables the kitchen is way worst."}
{"text":"Went to Buffalo Wild Wings on Monday. Wasn't as busy as I thought it would be with the different sports on TV. But I go for boneless wings, not to watch games. They had brand new menus! You could tell they had never been used before. The Italian burger caught my eye right away. It had mozzarella sticks, marinara, and pepperoni! Red Robin once had a burger like that called the Wise Guy and it was delicious. But I digest... I came for boneless wings and I was getting boneless wings. The menus now say small/medium/large instead of the actual number of wings... kind of annoying. We got the medium size which was 18 wings and got 3 sauces: honey bbq, lemon pepper (dry rub), and teriyaki. We also got the potato wedges with cheese and bacon. Everything was good. They put a lot of bacon on top of the wedges! Those wedges are so tasty and are great with just cheese. Really the only bad part about the meal was when we got a box for our leftover wings and forgot to grab it when we left! I was so mad. 6 perfectly good wings gone to waste... :'("}
{"text":"Got to love wings! Every sporting event you can imagine is broadcasts on one of the tons of TV's they have around the bar and restaurant section. Family friendly as well. They have great happy hour specials and on Tuesdays they have wing specials. They have a game you can play against others in the bar while your there and compete monthly which is fun. Service is good, quick and friendly. Place is clean and sport friendly. They also have an outdoor area with TV for those cool nights when you want the fresh air and still catch the games!   Highly suggest for watching sports, great apps and wings (honey BBQ my fav). Also good for the family, my nephew loves it."}
{"text":"Bartenders were really good- had to deal with some drunk guy and handled it well. Wings just weren't as quality as I was hoping."}
{"text":"Great service. Been to the BWW in Hawaii. Expected the same poor service. Gave it another shot and was very pleased. Very prompt and courteous.  Beth and Kyle were very attentive. The service was great and friendly. Food was good"}
{"text":"Great service and had great food tonight was Golden Nights play offs and it was great with all the energy."}
{"text":"I came here because I love the buffalo wild wings back at home. I didn't have high expectations since I came in and the place was pretty much packed ,cause Thursday night football . I usually sit at the bar, friendly bartenders. Great machines! And its open 24/7 and a walking distance from the hotel and it  makes it the best spot to go on a night out. I love the steak burger and most of all the cheap beers during happy hour. Love the vibe as well since I'm a big time huge sport person of all kinds."}
{"text":"My first time coming here without really knowing what to expect but ended up having a great time. We ordered a basket of several types of wings and asked for the trivia games to play with. The wings and coleslaw were super delicious. The games were fun to play and the beer was good.   It was a surprise as to how much I enjoyed my two hours here. The space is large clean with many large TVs on the surrounding walls."}
{"text":"My favorite B Dubs in the Vegas area.  It's located on a small strip mall and parking with limited parking in the front, but there is plenty of parking on this side and in the back. When it's dark, it is a little discomforting to park in the back so don't come by yourself. When you walk in, you are greeted almost immediately and seated. During major sporting events, I would recommend either coming early or ordering to go. We haven't had any problems either with the service or the food. I always order the traditional wings with wild sauce. They are always prepared to my liking. I would recommend this location to all."}
{"text":"Oh gawd whenever I think about BWW's I cringe at the awful customer service I'm about to receive at the bar, no matter the location (9 times out of 10, service is awful). I also have to brace myself for freezing cold temperatures inside. Bring a jacket if you're always cold like me! For this particular visit, me and my husband met another couple at the bar. They were holding seats for us so we were able to right walk up and sit at the bar.  I have never eaten a wing in my life, or at least not that I can remember. I've been a vegetarian for over 11 years and I don't plan on eating any wings in the future either! With that being said, dining at BWW's is a happy medium for me and my dude. Why? Because they have a token black bean burger for me, along with lots of other vegetarian options like flat breads, quesadillas, and your usual neutral appetizers while he gets his wings. Both parties are content!   SCREAMIN' NACHO BURGER ($9.95?): I always order this with the black bean burger when I come to Buffalo Wild Wings. They used to have a black bean wrap but it's no longer on the menu. Fries are hit and miss. They're usually stingy with the fries. 3.5/5   SERVICE: Our waiter virtually ignored us. It was difficult to get his attention to order food and ask for refills even though he was standing directly in front of us at the bar. The other couple wanted to order a dessert but gave up because service was so slow.   VIBE: There was a sports game on but I wasn't paying attention. It was loud inside and pretty busy.   Worth a Return Visit? Probably not at this location since it's so far away from where we live. There are 3 other BWW's in much closer proximity, so it doesn't make sense to make the trek out here. Also, this location doesn't stand out at all. I'd rather get crappy service close to home.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #139"}
{"text":"Our first night in town on vacation 4/17/15 we decided to have dinner at this location. Well let's just say we should have gone to Chili's or the barbecue place next door. The was a 40 minutes wait so we sat in the bar area for faster service. We just wanted something simple our first night so we ordered two salads, fish tacos and a chicken wrap with onion rings. Simple order right?  Wrong our waitress Amanda needs to be retrained because she service was horrible from the moment we sat down. It took us 50 minutes to get our food. The salads lacked dressing and the onion rings were lukewarm. We asked for extra dressing and that took her over 10 minutes. Really? It was the worst meal ever. Then we wanted the check and had to wait till she was done talking to friends of hers at a table near us for over 10 minutes then she started talking on the phone. When I finally was so annoyed I walked to bar to ask the bartender to print our bill she shows up with her normal I'm stuck on stupid look. This was the first time I have ever reduced a tip because I was so darn pissed off with the service received. She attempted to apologize as I was leaving her a horrible tip and I stop her in mid BS sentence by telling her I was not trying to hear her excuses for her horrible service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend works here and she came in 45 minutes after I ordered food. When she got here she checked on my order and the guy who is serving us never put the order in. I'm so furious right now I'm about to fight this guy."}
{"text":"The wing sauces are good but the wings themselves are TINY and for the size the price is way way way to high!!!! Although I still get a craving for the Jamaican Jerk Wings.....Yummmmmm  The chairs also suck monkey b@lls! They are so uncomfortable!!!"}
{"text":"MUST READ BEFORE DINING AT THIS LOCATION!! What a waste of our time and money. One of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant. I have reached out to Buffalo Wild Wings about my experience and I have never received an email back which is beyond ridiculous. To begin, my boyfriend and I had come in for dinner and he had ordered a cheese curd burger. We waited and waited and we had finally recieved our food. Our waitress dropped off our food and then had walked away before we realized that the cheese curd burger we had ordered was missing a prime ingredient, the cheese curds. We did not see our waitress for about 15 minutes. When she had finally asked us how our food was, we made her aware that it was the wrong burger. She took the burger to the kitchen and returned with the cheese curd burger instantly. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and thought that they made the new burger pretty quick. We had taken a bite of the burger and realized it was the same cold burger that we had first recieved with the cheese curds just added on top. Why not make us a new burger?!? At this point we were hungry and tired. We then asked for the check. Once I looked over the check I realized the waitress had charged us for 2 burgers when we had only ordered one. I brought it up to our waitress and she had stated \"oh yeah I know I am just waiting for my manager to fix the check.\" First of all, why would you give us the wrong bill and expect us to pay for it without even saying something to us. To this day, I believe that if I hadn't looked over the bill and said something she would have charged us the full amount to get a bigger tip. Once we left the restaurant I instantly sent an email to Buffalo Wild Wing's customer service. It's been quite while now and I still haven't heard anything back. I am disappointed in the food and the service of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, usually with coworkers for lunch. Service is always pretty good and I like how this one lady always comes around to punch your frequent eater card (or whatever they call it). Went there solo today, sat on the patio. Sat downwind from some smokers, my mistake. My server was nice and all but my wings too over 15 minutes and he apologized to me three times. The place was not busy at all, surprisingly. I wasn't in a huge hurry but was on my lunch break. When they finally arrived, they were really hot and delicious. Got the wedge fries, totally worth the additional 60 cents. Half way through eating I realized I needed to get a move on so I could get back to the office. Server brought me a to-go box and then proceeded to chat. It wasn't that it was unwelcome but I really needed to get going. He was a nice young man but maybe not quite aware of the social cues I was signalling. I like the Thai Curry and the Hot BBQ sauces."}
{"text":"Twice eaten here and got sick. Found out the kitchen personal don't keep cooking area clean."}
{"text":"Well I wasted $10 to wait for a 6-wing combo for a whole hour, so there's that. Don't know if the chef just wanted to take his sweet time or what. If tips went directly to chefs, I would've stiffed him. It was slow, no rush, only about 4-5 parties there and one to-go order. I only tipped because the bartender was cool and it wasn't his fault the chef was being slow to the point of taking an hour to make a snack-sized."}
{"text":"Delicious as always, I never have bad service at this location. Always warm and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went here and food was below average for wings. Fried pickles we loved but for my second time there it was not good. Wings were hard ( bbq boneless wings.) First time great. I have to go back for a third to make final decision."}
{"text":"Wings and appetizers are always good, fun environment for the most part. Service is never outstanding, tonight in particular but bc everything else is generally good I'm sure we'll still continue to go back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a two star rating only because the beer was good and our server attentive. The wings were horrible. The place was almost empty and for a Friday night at 6:30, this ain't good."}
{"text":"The server had our food out in 4 minutes. No way was it warm.  I've had so much better."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a snack on Friday night. We both had mild wings. Mine were great, but hers were way too spicy for her.; Her mistake was she said nothing but ate the wings anyway. Our server, Ebony, was really good and attentive. She brought the issue to the managers attention, who followed-up immediately. As my wife didn't want anymore wings the manager (Lauren is her name) had a to go order prepared for my wife and expressed her sincere apologies. I maintain that a good place shows its worth when things go bad This alone sets this place above many others I've been to. After reading the reviews, I found none of them to be the case tonight."}
{"text":"Great wings and beer. If you are new to the place you can try the beer for free but in a shot glass. Also you can try the different sauces on fries for free too. My wife to be and I love coming here at night."}
{"text":"So horribly disappointed with the new \"we don't accept any changes or substitutions\" on Tuesday 1/2 price wings day. We always get flats only, but not it isn't an option anymore (even though the web site still advertised differently). Oh well...  so now we can't get what we truly want and that can go along with their crappy service. Guess it's finally time to move on to someone else's wings. (Btw - way to have zero balls management)"}
{"text":"You have to order extra wet to get a regular amount of sauce. If you don't ask for them extra wet chances are there will be some sauceless spots on your wings. I wish there was another 24 hour wing spot besides this one that wasn't on the other side of town but it seems this is what we're stuck with."}
{"text":"Simply put: if you like Buffalo Wild Wings food, then you'll love this BWW as a whole. I give the 3 stars because I'm not too much a fan of the food. But I have been to this location a multitude of times with groups of 20 or more on the weekend and we have never really had too much of a difficulty being handled. We would call ahead and they would rearrange tables to accommodate the group. Multiple servers coming around to help. Obviously there were the occasional mishaps but nothing crazy. I can understand that for such a big group on a saturday night. Overall I give the service 4/5, the environment a 4/5, and the food a 2.5/5."}
{"text":"Beyond horrible. My wife ordered regular plain chicken wings with bones in them, and we got tiny crappy boneless chicken wings with sauce slathered all over them. Meat was dry as hell, I had two bites and that was all I could stand. I checked the side of the bag, where there's a quality control sticker that tells you who checked the bag for accuracy. Not surprisingly the name slot was empty. Worst. Wings. On Earth. Even if they DO get your order right. #neveragain"}
{"text":"I want to give it ZERO.  This place just opened and it's nasty.  Dirty menus (yeah, I like old dried wing sauce inside my menu).  Waitress dumped wings on the dude behind us.  I knew better than to go there....but the crowd convinced me to go with them.  Food sucks, wings suck, service sucks, TV volume was so flippin loud you could not hear anyone.  I've been to other BWW and should have known better.  Really a dozen wings served in a lousy cardboard container with sauce on the side with a sticker stuck on the sauce condiment cup...don't they do that to hospital food?  One napkin when we're ordering wings?  I asked for more and the waitress brought 4 for a table of 6 - ever take a math class???  Later on you get to see your waiter/waitress hovering around the soda machine drinking soda out of white paper cups...yeah, that's what I want to see, ASU undergrad servers sucking on free soda while we're eating dinner.  BWW = But Why Would I go back again?????  Oh yeah, their Mar Vee Zuh (margarita + corona) sucks too.   Send your bartender over to Sol Cocina in Newport Beach and see what a reall \"Bulldog\" is supposed to look and taste like.  I swear the bartender put a splash of margarita in the glass and topped it off with tap PBR or some other horsecrap beer = nasty again."}
{"text":"Horrible service I'm not sure if you was her first night or whatever it was going on but seriously the service was unacceptable. We sat our self at the self sea5 bar. We waited over 15min before we were even acknowledge, mind you there was only one other table. I asked about there drink menus she had absolutely no knowledge I had to walk over to the bartender to order the drink that I wanted. My friends my waited over 30 minutes for our food and when it came out it was wrong. I ordered there breaded chicken wrap with the tie jerk sauce the chicken I had absolutely no sauce. My server was nowhere around so I had to stop and ask a manager how to fix my order. Even then when it came back out there was barely any sauce in my wrap. I have to ask multiple times for a side of the jerk chicken sauce and ranch finally I just asked the manager because I knew she would bring it out. It took another 15 minutes for a waiter to even stop by after you finish eating to be able to pay for our tab. She had to be reminded multiple times to bring back take away boxes. She forgot to bring back art to go Pepsi after we asked over 3 different times so then again I went and got the manager and she did it for me. She also forgot to bring back our change and soon to keep it so then again I had to ask the manager for it back my overall experience was just horrible this used to be one of my favorite spot stop in for a few drinks and wings but I don't think I'll be returning because of this. I'm not that picky or critical of a person but this is just ridiculous. I think my server's name was Jessica or Jessie something like that. She had black hair and freckles."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings has seriously great wings.  I have tried 10 or so varieties and they were great.  I don't like the sweet ones, but I don't like anything sweet so I knew I wouldn't like them.  These are serious upstate New York wings.  Awesome.  Crispy as hell and the sauces coat perfectly.  Their spiciest wings aren't extremely spicy, but they're plenty spicy.  They have unspicy and everything in between.  Most that I've had are the correct amount of spicy.  These wings are done right.  Nobody does wings perfect out here, and most places flat out suck.  But this place is a chain, and they do wings perfectly.  This is mind blowing.  I know what I'm talking about with wings.  I'm from Connecticut.  My family lives in Buffalo.  I've been eating buffalo wings since I was born.  I love buffalo wings.  Where I am from, I have the qualifications to expertly judge 3 kinds of foods: wings, pizza, and new york style chinese.  Because I had these things several times a week for 25 years.  Everything I've had here is greasy or overly greasy.  It's sports-bar food.  I came in expecting crappy chain restaurant food.  Nope!  Definitely better than every other chain restaurant.  Just because of the wings?  MAYBE!  DON'T JUDGE ME!"}
{"text":"Today, I stopped in to BW-3 with an old friend.  I ordered the fish tacos yet again and they were yummy yet again.  The service was fast and friendly, which is perfect for lunch during work hours.  The fish tacos were hot, tasty, and they included a side of tortilla chips and salsa.  My friend ordered the sliders, which he appeared to really like, but he did not eat his french fries.  This place is good and I would visit again."}
{"text":"Stopped in to BW-3, yet again, and had the buffalo grilled chicken wrap with fries.  Again, the service was perfect and the food was terrific.  Keep up the good work bdubs!"}
{"text":"Stopped by BW3 for dinner and a Cavs game the other night. The place was packed, but there were still a couple tables available and we were seated immediately. I ordered a chicken salad and some Honey BBQ chicken wings. My wife ordered a chicken quesadilla and we shared some fried Wisconsin cheese curds.  The cheese curds were hot and tasty with just a bit of crunch from the deep fried batter. They were very tasty and I couldn't stop eating them. The sauce they are served with was sweet and creamy. I liked it a lot.  My salad was very filling and tasty. I chose grilled chicken to top it, which was doused in medium Buffalo sauce with a side of ranch dressing. The ingredients in the salad were fresh and it was plenty for a meal.   The chicken wings were excellent. No complaints there. The chicken is never frozen, which I believe helps give them such a good flavor. Of course, the Honey BBQ sauce was excellent too, but the quality of the chicken is the key to BW3's great wings.  My wife really like the cheese curds too. She didn't finish her quesadilla, so I polished it off the next day for breakfast and I think it was tasty, even the day after.   The tall craft beers we had were on point. This was our first dine-in visit as a family to this location, even though it's right around the corner from our house. We'll probably be back, but we generally try to avoid bar food while dining out, which is why I ordered a salad."}
{"text":"This place is basically a sports bar. Plain and simple. If you want bar food and drinks then this is the place for you!  I came around 6pm on Friday and was seated at the bar promptly. No complaints there. Service began rather quickly and we decided on onion rings as a starter and a couple mojitos while we sorted through the menu.  The onion rings were very good and the dipping sauce reminded me of the sauce Outback uses with their blooming onion.   The mojitos we got were the angry berry mojitos with the angry orchard in them. My wife had a sip and hated it so she opted for another one, which the manager happily replaced and didn't charge us for. I didn't mind mine.  We both ordered small orders of wings in Caribbean Jerk and Hot flavors. The Jerk was spicy yet sweet and quite good. The hot was exactly how it sounds.  We ordered another round of mojitos which came out quick. We also ordered some cheese curds, but they never came out. We had to cancel our order because we'd had enough of the noise after sitting for an hour waiting.  If you get here during the slower times, the place is pretty good. If you happen to be here during the rush then prepare to suffer slow service and loud noise."}
{"text":"I took the family to this place for the first time this evening. We ordered both the normal wings and boneless wings. While the sauce was fine, the chicken tasted awful. It was WalMart microwavable chicken nugget quality. Save your money and make your own."}
{"text":"We used to love this place a few years ago, but something's changed.  The hard seats are uncomfortable, service was poor (our orders were wrong, requested items were forgotten, etc...) and the quality of the food didn't come close to making up for the noise and thrown together feel of the place. The doughy buns all fell apart, my husbands meal was served in a tiny paper container.  Tables were so close together, we had to be seated one table over just to be able to get in and out.  Even the wait staff seemed uneasy about our ability to move around.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"\"Worst meal I ever ate\" says my 4 yr old daughter. My wife and I agreed with her. The wings were so overcooked, they were nearly impossible to separate the chicken from the bone.  Strangely enough, my daughter is keeling over in pain and my wife just puked 3 times, despite eating the most overdone wings we've ever had.   They total redid the interior and got rid of the fun arcade games my daughter and I used to play here. Instead, they run an insanely loud game that was so loud I couldn't even hear what my wife ordered.   The only redeeming thing was that the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this made me upset enough to write one. We arrived for a quick dinner but waited over 30 minutes for our order to get to us (which was two small orders of wings). Our waitress was horrible, she was late getting our order to the kitchen so two groups of people that were seated 5 and 10 minutes after us got their food before us. Then one of the wing flavors arrived wrong, I asked the order be cancelled. One of the managers arrived and said that our order would be cancelled (she did NOT offer any discount). I told the manager what happened and she said that food is served in the order it reaches the kitchen. That basically told me that our waitress slacked off. We asked our waitress to call the other manager over , she first stopped and talked to some of her coworkers never getting the manager. We had to get the other manager ourselves (AJ was his name) he was actually understanding and helpful. I like Buffalo Wild Wings but this experience has changed that."}
{"text":"I ordered food over the phone and was told 10 minutes. I waited 30 minutes in the restaurant for my food because \"there is only one register\".   The service was shitty. No one greeted anyone, they asked irrelevant questions. I wouldn't recommend this location if you're trying to order food on the go."}
{"text":"This place... Love/hate relationship right here. Taylor Swift song right here.  The servers never refill my water frequently enough. They are slow to bring baskets/napkins/utensils.   But where else do you get delicious, spicy, boneless wings?"}
{"text":"I take the family here consistently for the Tuesday wing special.  Talking with the waitstaff the store was taken over by corporate due to poor previous owners.  I have always had a great time and end up ordering a table full of food with no complaints.  This location is more of a family atmosphere I think mostly due to being in surprise."}
{"text":"GONE WAY DOWNHILL!!! When we arrived, the server was very slow to greet us. It took forever to get my beer my husband had to go up to the bar and get it himself because it sat there for 15 minutes, then, i recieved my 8 boneless buffalo wings and they were so dry with barely any sauce. I asked the server for more and she gave me a very rude look (deer in the headlights) no apologies, and finally took the food back. Well I got my new wings five minutes later (which i dont know how i got them so fast because when i first ordered it took 25 minutes!) oh wait i know why i got the replacement wings back so quick, because she brought the same wings back out!!!!!!! I was so frustrated i took them and paid the 40$ bill and we left. The manager was sitting at a table next to us talking with one of the girls who use to work at buffalo not even in the kitchen watching the food that was being sent out. He was flirting with this girl too it was really weird. He was a heavy guy and i beleive hispanic. He had on a beige shirt. Anyways, very disatisfied with this place and will not ever go back it was a big waste of money we only get to eat out once every couple months cause we are broke and this was just really upsetting."}
{"text":"Updated!!! The bartender who is awesome was Ryan. Late night Saturday; he was beyond amazing.   Also, the cooks in the back this late....Laaaawwwddd Jesus, my Asian zing wings were literally made with so much love!! I come to bww a lot but mainly the one on Las Vegas blvd where the outlets are, this one kills shit.  My wings were DRENCHED In sauce just the way I love it & my blazin sauce on the side was perrrrrrfect.  Shout out to the graveyard shift....y'all the muthafuckin shit! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"B Dubs is one of those places that you visit, are very unimpressed, but for some reason you decide to go back for overpriced underwhelming food months later and your kick yourself saying why did I do that. This was the first time I went to the Westgate location and to say it was bad was an understatement. First we were seated at a sticky, dirty, unbalanced table outside. Bugs stated flying toward our table. We waited for ten min and no one had taken our drink order. When we told one of the waitress she had us move to her section. We finally ordered wings, and fries a water and lemonade. The wing order was for 24 wings and our bill was $45 bucks total! Are you freaking kidding me. The wings were super salty, hard, and the fries were soggy and tasted like crap. Please don't inflict unnecessary pain on your stomach or wallet. Stay away from this crap establishment.  -Love Ruben"}
{"text":"The manager of all people (Patrick specifically) decided to tend to the line of 4 that came after me rather than simply assisting me (since I was first to arrive at the desk) since he was in the middle of showing Jessie how to add money to multiple gift cards I of course waited patiently, but to be out aside for other costumers is absolutely rude. Especially after I have them their time needed to conclude their brief training moment. Priorities are out of place here. Bless jessie, she was a doll even after noticing my discomfort when being put aside for others when all I needed to do was pay for my preordered meal. Simplest of tasks. This treatment is unacceptable && staff standards are below zero."}
{"text":"The waitresses are very obnoxious and rude. The food takes a lifetime to receive. Upon arrival, the food was cold and grossly undercooked."}
{"text":"I had AYCE bone-in wings for 14 on a friday afternoon during a lunch break.  - difficult parking. bunch of uhauls take up space. - lots of TVs! you watch olympics, basketball, mma, baseball, practically anything! - slow service. very important bc i only have a 1 hour lunch break. 1st wings (10) comes out in 15-20m. it was fairly empty too when we were there.  - comes with french fries and 2 sides of ranch - every other order comes with only 5 wings. took 10m to receive. - compared to chicken bonz, lemon pepper is not as salty, which is a good thing - spicy garlic is pretty salty. expect an extra water refill.  - in 30m, i was able to take in 25 wings. not bad.  - that comes to about 50cents a wing. ehh, alright.."}
{"text":"Sam was an awesome waitress. Food was good and portions plentiful.  I could have done without the feathers on one of the wings.  Totally grossed me out. But I understand it happens. No place is perfect.   Will definitely return. They have Stella on draft ice cold. $7.50 for a 20 oz. not bad. But Price could be better."}
{"text":"As expected of any Buffalo Wild Wings, this place was on par with all other places. We spiced it up this time and tried the Pepper Steak Wrap, along with the Mango Habanero, and Carribean Jerk. Would definitely do the whole combo again, although the Habanero killed my taste buds for awhile LOL  Get here early on special event nights! BWW doesn't charge covers for UFC fights, but the place starts getting packed during prelims. And then...I heard they also ran out of chicken, whoops :P"}
{"text":"i was in a hurry, so i really didn't get a chance to enjoy the atmosphere...but it looks like its a cool place to go watch some football...i might have to try that out"}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars because they took over one hour to bring our food. Including our appetizers. HOWEVER, I spoke to the manager David, and explained how upset I was and he personally went in the kitchen grabbed our food and brought it to us. He handled the situation like an efficient manager. Five stars for David the manager."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Expensive Cold bland food.  My sons lemonade was 3.59! We also had flat bread pizza. Saved in a basket so all the cheese was in the middle. What a mess. Boneless wings were mostly breading.  Total bummer of an experience"}
{"text":"This is more of a review regarding the service.  We have been there twice, sat at the bar both times and had the complete displeasure of seeing the bartender Carlos or \"los\" as his jersey states.  Horrible bartender.  The last time, we had a female bartender and \"los\" came over and asked us to close out our tab because he was leaving.  He was not our bartender and wanted us to close out our tab because he wanted the 2 bucks for the tip.  The food there is not worth speaking about so it's not worth having to deal with \"los\" either.  Too bad.  The location is great."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here because our friend from Japan was dying for some good ol' American chicken wings. Honestly, I'd much rather have gone to a different wing spot.  The wings at BWW's are wet and soggy...just like...never mind! They have a variety of flavors but none of them are actually outstanding. I do not like their version of Parmesan garlic. So, I tried the spicy garlic wings which were better than Parmesan garlic...but that's not saying much because they were only ok. Nice and spicy...but still wet and soggy. I like my wings crispy.  I also tried a strawberry lemonade to wash it all down. It tasted like straight up concentrate. Overly sweet even after adding lemons and water.   The only thing I liked from this place were the potato wedges. Great flavor and textures.  The service was not remarkable. My wings came first and my potato wedges came 15 minutes later. The drink glasses were sticky. We had to keep following up on our orders and to-go boxes. They were giving us wrong items. We already paid our bill and they were still giving us food for a different table. What a mess!"}
{"text":"We ordered some wings and mozzarella sticks for takeout here and unfortunately when we got back to our room we realized they only gave us half our wings. This was partially our fault for not checking but it was still frustrating. The wings we received had just a dab of sauce on each one. When we called to ask the gentleman on the phone was indifferent and then finally got the manager. The manager was very nice. We made the 10 minute trek back to bww. We got back and the man at takeout was very rude and unhappy. He gave us the wrong wings and we came back in. We put out this employee because he had to get the manager. Why? Again, the manager was very kind and ended up giving us five extra wings which were all thoroughly covered. I give this manager 5 stars but the other service makes it impossible to leave more than two stars. I'll be going to a different b-dubs next time I crave your delicious mozzarella sticks and honey bbq."}
{"text":"We have become regulars here and come at least once a week to play trivia. We always sit at the bar and love the bartender Missy who always remembers our drinks when we sit down. :) Shes the best. The garlic parm wings are a must as well as the potato skins with cheese."}
{"text":"Love BW3's but this is THE WORST of all franchise locations!! Not sure what the problem is here... but every time I give it another chance, I'm provided with another reason not to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego. We don't have wings this good. They have wing deals and a plethora of sauces to choose from. Come with your buddies, get different sauces and try all their wings. I really don't know what else I can say except that I love you, Buffalo Wild Wings, and I hope you can come to San Diego so I don't have to shed a solitary tear every time I drive by a mediocre wing place in San Diego."}
{"text":"Food is good and depending on the waiter service is usually good. The grave yard bartender named Rocky is super good and nice!"}
{"text":"The manager Josh is a complete jerk. He will be the reason this place goes down hill!"}
{"text":"This location is probably my least favorite. It's always packed with young adults and the staff can be rude. I usually like to sit at the bar, have some beer and order some wings. My waitress was really friendly and consistently checked on me to see if I needed anything. However, there was another gentlemen by the name of Roy behind the bar who was also assisting people with their orders. As he was cleaning up the area, he would crumble up napkins and shoot them in the garbage pail right in front of me where I was eating. Well one of them manage to hit my food, I notice, he notice, he just snagged it quickly, went on bartending and didn't say anything! Absolutely unacceptable behavior behind the bar! Once, I was finished I paid for my meal, drinks and mentioned the scenario to my waitress. She apologized for his behavior, mentioned it to Roy and he finally apologized as I left. Overall, the food was great, beer was tasty and definitely wont be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"BDUBs used to be one of my favorite places to go, especially on Tuesday nights with my boyfriend. But recently, service has been slow and prices have gone up. Even though the wings are now \"bigger\" I am not sure if it is worth the extra 20 cents they added without telling us. I'd rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Pretty much a typical BDubs.  Service was prompt and courteous.  The wings were a little underdone and that is never good.  Flavor was good, and the portions seemed a little larger than normal.  I had chips and salsa with my wings and ran out of salsa before I was half way done with my chips.  Also, the place was really dark for lunch.  Could barely see the menu to decide what I wanted."}
{"text":"I went here around 230pm and it was very slow which is great because we got our food fast.  I ordered off the kids menu and it said you have to be 12 or younger to order off that menu but the waitress didn't say anything so I figured it was ok.  So when we got our bill she had charged me for a soda...when the kids meal comes with a soda.  I asked her about it and she was rude and brought up the kids menu and said it wasn't allowed but she did it for me anyways.  That's fine but she should have told me I would be charged for the soda.  I would have been fine if I knew ahead of time. Other than that problem the food was good."}
{"text":"Visited this location 3 times and gave them a fair shot, NEVER again. The first time we came down after a baseball game and were serviced by Monique. She was extremely hospitable and interactive. We were so hyped about our visit and her service alone we told our work friends about it the next day.  Our next visit was national chicken wing day. A large group of us tried to make a reservation and were kind of given the runaround. We were told \"no\", then \"we'll make it work\", then \"well we can seat you but any of your other friends have to be seated later at their own table\", and so on and so forth. We get it, it's probably the worst day of your lives dealing with the masses on national wing day, but try not to show it so much. We're a practical group and understand limits/policy as long as they are communicated thoroughly and consistently. Staff seemed very uninterested in the money of 10-13 hungry borderline alcoholics. We all eventually got so fed up we left and went to our usual bar.  Our third visit was the last and final travesty. This was a normal day with no promotions or special events and only 6 of us. Our server was this nice but seemingly overworked girl. Long story short her attitude was great til she messed up an order, never came with a drink, brought us a drink in a dirty stained glass, etc. After all these errors and corrections she was rude and argumentative. The table behind us also had an issue with her service and called the manager over, who was 5x's less apologetic or helpful than the server.   To this day, my coworkers and I go out at least once a week to spend our money on booze and chicken wings. Needless to say, this place will not become part of the weekly cycle. Even though BWW is a chain, they missed out on a large group of regulars."}
{"text":"Great place for a Friday night dinner, great beer selection and amazing fried pickles"}
{"text":"Decent wings and food. If you want to watch a game or multiple game, great place. But that is about the only reason why you would go here. Average food, simplistic decor that feels uninviting. But, again, if you want to watch a game, they will have it on or can put it on for you."}
{"text":"Grand Opening Day for BDub's on the strip! Very clean environment, super friendly staff (Rachel M is da bomb diggity). Started off with some street tacos and beer - cheers!  Plenty of big screen TVs and captain to help change the channels. Looking for a place to hang out that's different than your typical boozy strip sports bar? Come here for good food and drinks."}
{"text":"Had the worst service our waiter Dorian was very slow we had to ask for stuff twice and when I found plastic in my salad he did not apologize he just took it and left the manager came out and apologized but regardless the service was not good took him another 15min to bring back our cards to sign and leave won't be going back"}
{"text":"Now we're having a good time, and they stop last call around 1am.  Most of the other bars are still serving so if you want to drink after 1am, go elsewhere!  Plus the waiter ask us how we're paying for our meals tha asking us for refills."}
{"text":"I personally love Buffalo wild wings for their honey barbecue boneless wings. I am a regular customer for the Thursday deal. .65 cents a wing? That's a better deal than paying their normal prices. Overall their service is pretty good depending on who you get I have my preferred server his name is Dave and he works on Thursdays. He's phenomenal with his service and has A great attitude.  There has been a few occasions where he actually jokes around with us and acts like our friend other than just our server so he gets an A+ in my book. We don't even have to tell him what kind of drinks we want he already knows. Some of the other servers who shall not be named need to follow his lead.   So to wrap up my review it's a pretty good place to go but only on the deal days because normal prices are a little too crazy."}
{"text":"I brought my daughter into this location on Thurs. 05/23 for lunch. I was extremely happy with my food and service. The lunch specials were phenomenal in price and quality. I asked someone there, maybe my server which wings they liked the best. I was told the Garlic Parmesan. Perfect choice!! My server was Marissa, and her service was above and beyond, and we loved talking with her. She even remembered my daughters boyfriend from a previous visit. 3 lunch specials and a few boneless wings for my youngest daughter (age 6) and a couple of iced teas. The price was around $32 bucks. AWESOME!!!!  Can't beat that! I would have spent that at McDonalds! Gross and no comparison in quality and ambiance!"}
{"text":"Boneless Thursdays are really my only excuse to come here. The wings can be hit-or-miss sometimes regarding moisture content and sauciness, but are tastey regardless."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Being that I'm from California; I wanted to grab something I was familiar with it sucks that I was mistreated the way that I was. All I wanted to do was switch out wings that I didn't like and get wings that I do like, the manager Hailey not only got what I wanted wrong once but twice ! and insisted that\" I the customer was wrong \" all I wanted was bar b q mango hash I don't understand how she can be in a management team for customer service, but make a customer feel so displeased and not even bother to correct their mistakes I will never return to Buffalo Wild Wings after the way I was treated."}
{"text":"Came here with friends on a Saturday at lunchtime.  I'm embarrassed to say that I've never tried chicken wings (gasp!) and, to that end, have never been to a BWW.    The place was not crowded but there were certainly people here at that time of day.  We chose seats at the bar and the bartender came to take our drink orders immediately.    So since wings aren't exactly my thing I didn't find the menu overly enticing.  But as a wing virgin I was determined to try something.  I ordered 8 boneless wings (OK, so I know this isn't exactly trying wings but I wanted to \"ease\" into wing sauce).  I got 4 medium and 4 teriyaki.  What I determined was that I can't stand regular wing sauce.  It's just not my thing.  It had a nice \"kick\" to it, which is what I was going for with the medium; I just didn't like the sauce itself.  The boneless wings were OK.  Not too chewy; pretty good as far as white meat chicken goes.  And I actually like the teriyaki sauce.  This is by no means an authentic Japanese type teriyaki sauce but it was sweet and it settled my craving for it.  At least I liked something, lol.    Lots of big screen tv's at the bar and around the place to watch sports if that's why you're coming here.  Attentive service at the bar.  Slot machines for your gaming enjoyment.  I'd come back if this is where my friends wanted to go, especially since it's so close.  But I probably wouldn't be the one suggesting it since it's just not my kind of food."}
{"text":"Came in last night. Placed a order to go. The girl at the front that took our order was super chill. They had our food ready like In 20 min.  Great service and great prices. Way cheaper than Cali.   Be back when I'm around the area!"}
{"text":"First time at this location... As soon as we walked in the door no one was to be found. After about 3 minutes finally someone asked if we have been helped and then was told someone will be with us shortly. The take out employee then asked us what we wanted to go.. Then we responded to be seated. After we got seated Kendra was our server. She was a good server although some things could of been done differently. We where not told about any of the specials untill we have received our wings. Then we where informed about the 65cent wings. No drink specials where talked about so we just ordered some tea.. If so we would of had a few drinks and The bill would of been higher as well as a bigger tip... About a minute and a half of actual table service was given. It was very slow this afternoon which is a perfect time to interact with tables and work us up for a bigger tip. Instead of doing that there were two employees sitting in the dining room eating like that was ok. Not only that but one girl was ordering a pizza on the phone!!! I know the employees don't always want the same food but at least it could of been done behind closed doors. Not in front of customers!!!! I usually tip very well 20 to 50 percent of the bill. Depending on overall service not just our server. if there would have been better teamwork we would have turned into weekly customer.... I'm not upset with Kendra, I've been there before. Just a little more help and training and she will be an awesome server. The manager leads by example.. In saying that, when it is extremely slow like today he/she should be walking around and going to tables thanking them for coming In... And be checking to see if everything is ok.. If that would of happened the problem would of been fixed and this would not be on yelp for the whole world to see. I might return this Saturday for the fight but if this happens again I will not be returning to this location again.. 50 dollars a week 2600 dollars or more a year for 1 customer only. Think about it !!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! No one came to even get our drink order until after 10mins of being seated. Then it took even longer to get someone to stop by and place our food order. The place wasn't even busy. They had more people in the greeting area then serving. It was ridiculous. I will never return!!"}
{"text":"Ya'no, i have been here so many times i cant count. When i visit bww i get the same product every time. If the place is packed sure the wait is a little long, but the cold beer makes up for it. I have always had the game i wanted turned on and theres a shelf for beer at the golden tee machine. 3 words wings, sports, beer. Dont be a baby."}
{"text":"Came here tonight around 10:35 PM, there were 5 other tables (booths) filled in the dining area and a few people at the bar. There what looked like 5-6 servers plus the bartender so there was adequate coverage for the few people that were there at this hour. The manager took our drink order, he brought it to the table quickly once we placed the order. He notified us that the server was busy and would be with us shortly ... time passes ... still not server after 10 mins ... more time passes ... still no server (25 mins had passed) by this time we sat there till 11:00 PM and didn't see our server once, mind you 3 other servers passed us and were tending to there tables with drinks and food so apparently our server got lost. Either way tonight was the last time we will be at this buffalo wild wings because their service is horrible. You don't need a diploma or even a GED to be a server to know 25 mins to greet your customer is to long, so either the server was busy participating in the circle jerk that was taking place in the back or they got lost finding their way to our table to take our order. Either way there are some ignorant lazy ass people that work here. Never had wing stop but that will be the next place we try to get wings from - I'm sure they'll have better service than this place because you can not get any worse than the service at this buffalo wild wings location.   And if a manager or any person from Buffalo wild wings wants to contact me about this experience, I would be more than happy to talk to you - because your employees are poorly trained and your service SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Great bartenders, great food, do not, I repeat, do not play the machines.... they are the tightest around."}
{"text":"Its always a good place to watch sports because they have so mant tvs everywhere.  On thursday nights they have 60 cent boneless wing night which is a huge steal.   Personally id come here over wingstop just because the experience is better for an avid sports fan"}
{"text":"This place is awful bad service ...never come over here racist ass managers ... we waited a long time and the waitress didn't want to serve us... servers have mad face"}
{"text":"This place gets packed on the weekends, so if you get there late for a game after 7-8 pm you're going to be waiting.   People are there to watch games and some even have meetings, which is sort of a bummer because some games go on for hours so you have guest sitting there while others have to wait. Only down side of sports bar.   Wings wings wings. I've seen so many people get angry at the waiters or cooks because there food isn't coming fast enough. There's a reason you go there to sit down you don't just get a quick bite to eat. It's a place to sit down for a good 20-30 minutes. So coming here you have to be patient. Chicken takes a while to cook my guess probably 6-12 minutes. I waited for my food for twenty minutes. But I seen so many other guest that I thought it was going to be long anyways. Food is cheap and good for price you pay can't expect gourmet for the cheap prices you pay.  I've gone here 6 times"}
{"text":"Great place to catch a game, however the service is below average.  Every now and then you will get an okay server who knows what they are doing and other times you wi watch an entire game without getting a water refill or have your old plates taken off your table. I don't know if they hire a lot of new servers but they need to focus more on customer service. Food is good though!"}
{"text":"Placed my order online, went to pick it up and they had no record of my order being placed, I even showed them the confirmation, and all the lady did was say sorry. She did not once offer to put the order in either"}
{"text":"After a failed attempt to get lunch at Extreme Pita (see previous review) we walked over to BWW and were pleasantly surprised. It was our first time there and from the outside we didn't expect to find a decently cool sports bar- not a bad seat in the house, there are literally wall to wall TVs, you can't miss the game.   The service was phenomenal from the hostess to the server to the runners. I even dumped my coke like a clumsy pregnant woman and a cheerful girl came over to clean it up and had the server over with a new drink in no time.   We started with a half dozen medium wings and they were very good. I had the buffalitos and onion rings. The rings were pretty average, and I liked the buffalitos a lot except that the flour tortillas was a bit dry/stale. My son got the popcorn shrimp and ate every last one of them, and hubby got a chicken wrap that he liked a lot.   We will definitely be back, mainly when I'm not pregnant and may partake in games and beer :D"}
{"text":"Ay yi yi. It all started with this girl working as a hostess with painted-on eyebrows, she was SO rude! Terrible business ploy to have an ill-mannered child working in the front of the restaurant  first impressions are big deal. She was also texting away on her phone when I entered and didn't acknowledge me or the two other girls behind me in line. The food was alright - a few of my boneless wings came out cold. The ONLY reason I'm giving this location 2 stars and not 1 is because our waiter was the sweetest guy ever. Under all the stress and tables that he had to run around catering to, he was completely calm and greeted us at the table with the friendliest smile. Also, another girl that worked there who brought us samples - Alli was very sweet and patient. PLEASE BWW, hire more people like Alli and Chad, and get rid of children who are incapable of smiling, greeting, organizing, seating, and growing natural eyebrows."}
{"text":"Good food but their delivery service sucks. I've ordered it three times and they have forgotten at least 3 items every time. There's no excuse for that. Will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Host gave no options to sit. Just that it would be 30-45min to sit, with a \"you're bothering me tone\". Asked about outside and was seated in 2 min. Then waited 25 minutes for drinks. Used Yelp to get Majerle's number. Told there was a couple tables. Walked out of BWW and walked over and seated and served drinks within 5 min."}
{"text":"We frequent here often and time and time again this place has stellar service.  Tonight is a prime example and why I'm writing the review.  Their manager is top notch and out of the 10s of bw3's I've frequented, this is the best."}
{"text":"Once again, this is a chain, so you know what you're getting when you walk in the door.  This particular location isn't my favorite, and I cant really quantify why.  Maybe its because the place is usually packed when I decide to show up.  Maybe I was just bloated and irritated each of the two times that I creased their cushions.  Anyway, I like wings, and I LOVE the BWW (not BBW) Asian Zing.  Its sweet, its spicy... kind of like Charo on the Surreal Life.  You gotta admit, she's pretty hot for being what... 89 years old.  Hey you wacky vegetarians... check out their garden burger.  This omnivore says: \"Pretty darn good\".  -Swoop"}
{"text":"I love this place, there wings are so delicious. Waiters are very nice. I so recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went in with another person we both had boneless wings of two different flavors and when they were served you couldn't tell the difference between either one of them I had a hot and spicy the other person had a mild flavor and they were identical other seasoning falls off them to bottom of the basket plus they're very dry"}
{"text":"Dear god this place is awful. I don't know why I've been there more than once. The service is always terrible, the restraunt is dirty, the wings are fatty and have a terrible taste. Any burger I've gotten I always send back. I haven't been back to this BWW or any others for that matter"}
{"text":"Not only did our waitress autumn tell us about the yummy 8.49 deal for 16 wings, but we also had great service from watching our drinks to suggesting great food. Defiantly recommend!"}
{"text":"Multiple occasions. Slow, rude service. Sub par food. Looks run down and most of the time dirty."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since my husband and I last visited this location or any Bdubz in awhile. We were given some gift cards and figured, why not? Well, we certainly regret our choice and honestly will NOT be returning. Aside from the staff being very in their own world, standing around talking and not paying attention to their section.. The food was lacking the deliciousness we remember  The sauce was used very sparingly with our chicken, our potato wedges were NOT cooked long enough (we had to return it). When we decided to just get to go boxes and leave, we found out that they changed their Tuesday deal from Traditional to Boneless, they didn't even say anything to us. We also learned they changed the prices, so you pay MORE for LESS. Not even worth it.   As a mother, the most annoying part is how small their high chair is. My daughter is very small and could barely bend her legs to get in    Won't be visiting again in awhile, if not ever.  They need to work on their staff and their attentiveness. Oh and the quality of their food."}
{"text":"I am here at least once a week.  Their wing sauces and rubs are amazing (try the buffalo dry rub).  AND it's one of the only places I can watch my east coast teams play (GO CAPS!)."}
{"text":"37 minutes for nachos for app. After we ordered our food it took almost 1 hour 11 minutes and order was incorrect. Would've left but the game was on. Will not return to watch game, eat food or to have a beer...even if free. Worse service ever."}
{"text":"3rd time coming. Food is good. Wait staff is cool. Not over the top. Let me know about the points so I downloaded the app. This place is open 24 hours. Well at night is age 21 and over I think after 11."}
{"text":"DANGER DANGER WILL ROBINSON! Buffalo Wild Wings does $9.99 all you can eat traditional and $10.99 boneless wings on Mondays-Fridays from 11-2. Not only do you get wings, but you also get the choice of fries, wedges, or buffalo chips. For an additional dollar, you can upgrade to onion rings.  Waking up to a text from Kristina D. at 9:30am about this magnificent deal, I jumped at the chance. After doing the math and feeling the gastrointestinal ramifications; come here on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday for the deal. On Tuesday, you can eat 20 wings for about the same price. If you can't eat that many, just do the $0.49 special. I know that AYCE includes a side, but they are just filler to distract you.  Even though the place was packed, the service is still as efficient as it normally is. They are quick with the delivery of wings and the refills on drinks are consistent."}
{"text":"Bone in wings Tuesdays are days to look forward to. On these days my friend and I tend to egg each other on to see who can be the bigger fatty. It is not a pretty sight for anyone within the vicinity, but at these prices would you care?   This location tend to have better quality wings then the one on Las Vegas Boulevard. We have been to both, on several occasions, and feel  the strip property has the most pathetically anorexic pieces.   We deviated on this occasion from our normal order of four six wing orders in Caribbean jerk, spicy garlic, mango habanero, and mild. Instead we got an ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer. The chips were fresh and not oily. The salsa was not bad, I was skeptical when my friend said that their salsa was good, but it was decent.   We stuck to our two favorite sauces; the mango habanero and spicy garlic, and tried one of the dry rubs. The Buffalo spice was a delightful variation from the normally saucy wings. It will be a new addition to our rotation. With all the sauces that BWW's has, alternating and trying new flavors is not always bad. Do it on a Tuesday or Thursday when it is cheaper to experiment."}
{"text":"The food is standard compared to other Buffalo Wild Wings. The service is attentive enough for bar food, but overall this location is dirtier than others. Maybe it was just the fact that it was on a Sunday and they got hit with the football crowd, but there was trash all over the ground.   One friend had not eaten dinner yet, so we stopped by to get her fed and two of us just snacked while watching the end of the game. An order of soft pretzels was piping hot and soft. The cheese sauce is nothing amazing, but you can ask for any of the wing sauces for dipping. The new Thai Curry Sauce is interesting. Good for a few, but cannot see getting a large quantity of it. It will not surpass my love of Mango Habanero, Caribbean Jerk, or Spicy Garlic.   Our server, Rose, was nice and kept our drinks full at all times. She checked up on us regularly as well."}
{"text":"I can only review the carry out service for this location and, unfortunately, it's pretty slow. I recommend you request your food to be ready at least 10 minutes BEFORE you arrive. Basically, if you want your food at 7:30pm, schedule it for pick up at 7:20pm. Chances are you'll still have to wait a bit once you arrive and it will still be hot and fresh from the kitchen.  As for customer service, no one goes above and beyond but it's an efficient transaction nonetheless.   If you're downtown and craving chicken or other BWW goodies, don't hesitate to carry out. Just be prepared to wait a little longer than normal."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been to every Buffalo Wild Wings in Vegas and this is the worst one. Every time we have gone we wait forever just for the server to come take our order. They have gotten our order wrong every time we come. They do not pay attention to there tables at all we have had to stop a different server to get refills cause our server disappeared. There has only been one server that we have had there that actually knew what he was doing. Not going back to this one that is fur sure."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been to all the Buffalo Wild Wings in Vegas and this is the best one. Great service. Food comes out fast. They keep an I on there tables if anyone needs refills. They have never gotten our order wrong like other Buffalo Wild Wings have. The waiters are very nice also."}
{"text":"So their wings in my opinion have always been just alright. Love the variety and they are never greasy but if they could make em just a tad crisper. I feel like they are a bit pricey as well. Staff that I experienced are friendly and helpful, never had to wait too long.  Another bummer, this location no longer shows the UFC fights, even if they are not pay per view. Not too bad of a place to catch a game, grab a snack and a beer."}
{"text":"So BWW hasn't changed much over the years just a few new menu items. I haven't been to a BWW for a few years but we wanted to watch the PPV UFC fight, so what the heck. It was a packed house, but service was good and we got our food quickly. Since it had been a while I had to see if the wings tasted the same. Yes they do, my complaint about BWW remains the same, they need crispier wings. I got them with Parmesan Garlic sauce which I really liked. I got to go back and buy a bottle for making wings at home. Got some fries, they were average skinny cut fries. Tried oneof my friends Fried Pickle chips, they were good, nice and crispy. IMO prices of BWW is too high, Wing Tuesdays is the way to go and get them cheaper. I've found better wing places in town so there isn't much bringing me back to BWW."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a drive from my home, but the salt n pepper wings and onion rings r totally worth it!!  Friendly servers, clean tables, a gazillion big screen TVs to watch every game, pub games and a huge parking lot!  It's extremely loud on a game night, so if you're looking for a quiet spot to chat...be sure not to go during a   game.   Only 1 complaint: The hook in the handicap stall is broken, so no place to hang a coat/purse!  Come on guys...$2 hook I'll drop one off   Check it out!"}
{"text":"one of the only places open in this neighborhood of Mesa on a friday night at 11:00PM. Just your typical BWW. Bar tender was not the friendliest but oh well."}
{"text":"I love wings as much as anyone but this place loses me with their over preparation of its wings. EVery sauce seemed to be loaded with thick syrupy candy. Tasting any chicken is an afterthought with these wings, its all about the sauces. Which to me, are way too sugary.  Tried 5 different flavors, the JAlapeno one was by far the most tolerable.  The atmosphere is sports bar and the acoustics of the building could not be worse. A guy screams because of a touchdown on the other side of the bar and it will send shocks up your spine as you sit on the most uncomfortable sold wood booth seat ever.  Pass."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and haven't had any issues with anything. The people are nice, the food, especially wings are great and the price is standard. I see many ratings here that are low, so I guess I'm one of the lucky ones that haven't had to experience what they have. I enjoy the large open area, friendly greeting when you come and when you leave.  Someone had made a comment to me about me working here or that I think all the other peoples ratings are crazy... No I don't work here or in the food industry and no I don't think all the lower ratings people gave are crazy. Everyone is entitled to their personal experiences and feelings and ratings, it's a good thing people have their own thoughts and views (I can't believe I had to say that on a good rating but felt it necessary since someone felt compelled to comment to me about my previous review)."}
{"text":"Good location, food and service. Lots of tvs and Trivia games make it also fun. Love the wings here too but they have other great food items like the sampler and burgers."}
{"text":"The hostess told us to wait 15 minutes for the seating when the restaurant wasn't even half full. Finally she sat us down in the corner where the waitresses hang out. (Yet no one bothered to refill my drink) Luckily our waitress was nice and food was almost average. We will go to Zipps next time."}
{"text":"i love any buffalo wild wings, but this one is especially sweet. the place is huge. large bar area and separate large dining room area. for anyone that has never been to a buffalo wild wings before, check it out! they have stuff for everyone. obviously wings, boneless wings, and a dish in just about every category that you can put wing sauce on. there's plenty of fried bar foods and salads without sauces as well. but you HAVE TO try the sauces. there's so many and they're all so different! my personal favorite is the caribbean jerk, followed by the asian zing. plus, if you're a gamer, or have restless children, there's touch games at every booth in the dining area, and you can pay to play against other competetors on the big screen."}
{"text":"The worst service ever!! We ordered wings and potato wedges. We never got our potato wedges and when we said something the server stormed off. We also ordered a sprite, but the syrup was out so we asked if she could change it. She clearly didn't know how and told us that everyone was busy. There was about 4 tables in the restaurant. I will never go back it was so awful."}
{"text":"I'm giving this BWW location one star after 3 bad experiences in a row. This most recent visit, I tried calling ahead to place my order (for about 10 minutes) and just received a busy/disconnect signal. I got to the restaurant, placed my order to go (20 wings, small fries), and promptly sat down. Approximately 35 minutes later, I get up and ask the employee behind the cashier to check on my order - low and behold my order magically appeared. Oh, and there were no fries with the order (which I discovered when I got home, my fault for not checking in the store). This location is also much stingier with the amount of sauce they put on their wings compared to the Eastern location. Food turns out decent, but compared to the other locations I've been to this store doesn't make the cut for customer service."}
{"text":"I placed a pick up order online at 4pm- with a confirmed pick up time of 6:10pm. It was Superbowl Sunday, however the dining area and bar were both almost vacant. There were several (15) of us waiting for our pickup orders, which were not coming out at our designated pickup times. An older gentleman asked to speak with the manager about how long he was waiting, and stated the same issue happened the prebious weekend when he ordered. The manager then told him \"and you still came back.\" Wow. Never coming here again. The staff was in no hurry to get us our orders, and I saw several people come back with bags in their hands and missing items in their order. Terrible organization for what should be their busiest day of the year."}
{"text":"You have to remember it is a national chain and people working there at times really didn't care if you have a good experience or not!  It does seem like the more often we go to a WBW the worst the overall experience gets and this location is no difference.  I love the sauces and the wings and the trivia!  Hate the servers, the shitty attitude of the young work force they employ.  There is thousands of place to choose from on Las Vegas Blvd to pay your hard earned money!  Take my advice pick any place other then this WBW location to eat at even at the bar the young lady working would rather visit then take your order, Stay away!"}
{"text":"nobody makes parm garlic wings like bdubs, they are the BEST wing sauce ever!   Aside from being a little pricey I am never not satisfied after eating a meal here.  I just recommend going either on a Tuesday or Thursday since their wings are on sale those days"}
{"text":"This place is good. I can't find anything bad about this place. Wall-to-wall screens with all the games. Seating is a little cozy for Sunday afternoon NFL, but it's expected. The servers were okay, but not  exceptional, you could tell they didn't LOVE coming to work.   The wings and sauces were delicious. As always.   That said, it's definitely a place I'll come back to. I hope the servers are a little more happy to be at work. When I see the service improve, I'll reflect that in my review. :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointing Wings to go. A week ago, I ordered 20 wings to go and it was my worse experience ever at a Buffalo Wild Wings. I waited patiently  27 minutes for my to go order and I had to ask how many minutes more before I can get my order, so the manager that took my order went to go check and she brought my order out right away, finally after 30 minutes. After arriving home 3 minutes later, My family and I opened the box of Wings and we laughed like WTF, the Wings were very small and cold. The Wings look like they were on Crack, no joke. They were Cold & Old. So I had to go back to BWW and ask for my money back, the manager stated that all their Wings are like that, bc of their shipment they received,  but when I was standing waiting for my Wings, other table orders that were coming out had big and fat juicy Wings, I told that to the manager and she said REALLY. She insisted they can make a new batch, but I refused. Management should never use excuses,  I will never return to BWW ever. Poor management & managers."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by our experience on Saturday. We got in around 1 and had not eaten at all yet that day, so we were very hungry! The food was very good, came out quickly and as ordered. I had no idea they added a sampler to the menu. We split that plus six extra boneless wings so we could get two flavors. The service was good and the food really was great. I did not have high expectations because of our previous BWW experiences but we wanted to try something other than our usual go-to spots and I'm glad we did!"}
{"text":"Dropped my 2 kids off to eat here at BWW they are both teens. I was eating next door. Manager and several staff members surrounded their table as they were looking thru the menu (after being seated) and told the teens to leave and refused to serve them. They were sitting in a booth in the restaurant section not the bar. No reason given. Rediculous. So they went next door to the Black Bear Diner which is tons better anyway and ate there."}
{"text":"A bunch of us came after the ROC Race.  This was my first time at this location.  We had ordered different wings, salad, and a burger.  The burger arrived quickly, but the salad and wings took forever to arrive.  We were all starving by that time.  The service was lacking.  I guess they didn't expect a large crowd that day.  Their wings were not anything special either.  It's wings, not sure why it took so long."}
{"text":"I love wings, and actually I love BW's but this place is too busy for its own good.   Eating in the restaurant is a nightmare. Especially with kids, long waits for table, drinks, ordering, food, the check. You get my drift.   Take-out is similar story,  orders are commonly messed up. Food is inconsistent. One day your wings are perfect he next day they have no sauce, next too cold...   There's better food options."}
{"text":"Plenty of TV'S for your viewing pleasure as well as trivia and poker games. The wings are good. I recommend the kickin' honey garlic. Their burgers are decent but really enjoy the Buffalo chicken wrap. They have an excellent selection of beers on tap and some delicious cocktails on the menu.   The only gripe I would have and I have run into this problem on a few occasions, is that they tend to run out of their monthly specials. This is more than likely a managerial problem but when you are 2 weeks into the month and you are out of your monthly special be it a cocktail, wing flavor, finger food or sandwich you need to reconsider your market and your ordering program.  The service is quite good and the hostesses are always there with a smile to greet you and make you comfortable."}
{"text":"Don't go! They might tell you a special and then you order it and they switch it. Got over charged and asked to speak to a manager. He was not only rude and not empathetic but called the police and I got trespassed. Another table overheard me and said they had the same issue and the manager walked away. Horrible service amd now I legally can't go back."}
{"text":"BWW is great!  The food is amazing, except that the wings don't come with fries :( you have to order them separately.  We usually eat in the bar and most of the staff are great.  Some of them aren't as great, so just hope you sit in the right area.  There are a million TVs for sports and if you get there early enough you can get your game on whatever tv is best for you."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the BWW chain for years so when I found myself on the otehr side of town on an errand, I stopped in for lunch. Our server was accommodating and very sweet to my hard-of-hearing Stepmother. The facilities were clean and the restaurant is heavily equipped with large screen TVs. My reason for taking away stars is simply because of the price. A lunch for 3 people cost me $60+tip. I'm sorry, but for the bar food we had (sliders and wings) this is just ridiculous! I've had wings at so many different places in town and can't say that the ones they serve here justify the high price tag."}
{"text":"Good bar food.   I really enjoyed the buffalo zoo cocktail.  Delicious and not too sweet.  Also had the Thai Ginger wings.  A bit sweeter than expected but very flavourful.   Great place to watch a hockey game."}
{"text":"We had dinner there tonight. Our appetizer was cheese curds. Half were burnt the other half were old and half white looking. All were extremely small with almost no cheese in them. Our entrees were terrible. The meat in the burgers tasted terrible and the fries were undercooked. The manager was yelling at everyone the whole time. Please do not go here. Foood is repulsive and un fresh. Will Never return to a Buffalo Wild Wings again. Check out Jared cooks twitter. They won't reply to my tweet so there's what happened when I got home. I'm still sick from their food."}
{"text":"The managers are worthless. I told the waitress we where freezing. Please tell the manager to turn off the A/C. Hour later manager shows up! Really!! The waitress was crappy too. She split sauce all over the table and just walked away. The food took forever to come out! This Bw3 is crap! Poorly ran!"}
{"text":"It doesn't matter when you come (I've been at all times) or if a game is on or not (I've seen every sport here) the service is awful. Management and ownership should be ashamed of the service they are putting out. Every server bar or table had other issues, lots of attitude and seam to want to be anywhere else other than serving you. I've never written a review like this and I am a hospitality GM but this place needs a complete house cleaning and attitude check. If this wasn't right by work and conscientious to catch the beginning of games I would never come here again. But if by chance you know an employee rest assured you will be taken care of but your the only ones. In short drive somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I am giving this restraint five stars because of their amazing management staff, my Son came in recently to treat his brother and young sister to Lunch. They had a not so terrific experience, I won't go in to the details since the follow up was extremely exceptional. We came back to a red carpet service. We will come back and recommend this location to friends and family. It really goes to show you that Customer service is really in the heart of the management team and how they execute their training."}
{"text":"Second time here. First time we were missing 1/2 of our to go order ( only two items ordered so only one item in to go bag).    We always order some to go when we eat somewhere.  This time was great. Emily was our waitress and she was great. Very attentive and helpful. Grant it, it was not as busy as the first time.  But it went very well and this time our to go had everything but my sauce, which still should have been there since it was noted on our check.  Waitress was great."}
{"text":"This was absolutely one of the WORST experiences in YEARS!  Nothing like being given a happy hour menu after happy hour is over.  The appetizers were cold.  The girls that work there are too busy to care about their customers.  Not being able to get refills, (my roomie would have loved another vodka tonic, this place doesn't like money) napkins, or a check is NOT my idea of customer service.  I'm used top the Las Vegas Boulevard location being bad, so I stopped going there a few years ago.  After seeing my roommate wait 10 minutes at the counter, asking for the check, the manager finally responded, and couldn't have cared less.  Not even an I'm sorry, much less a need for specifics to fix their problem.  I live close to BW3, and LOVED it in Columbus, Ohio.  Tonight I was treated WORSE than a Wolverine fan from start to finish!  BW3 has gotten too big for their britches, and just does not care about their customers.  Cold food, and the worst service EVER leave a lot to be desired.  I'll go to PT's where I get GREAT service.  Forget BW3 with their overpriced menu, and God awful service.  NEVER AGAIN!  Avoid this trap at all costs. The staff does NOT care about you!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed, no matter what is going on sports-wise.  I've only sat in the bar area, but I've always got decent service.  They always have the big fights on and there are plenty of TV's to catch whatever you want on.    Pretty good food, pricey for what it is though.    Located close to the Pearl Rd. exit off of 71, so it's convenient for meeting people there.    I attended a fundraiser here that was located in the back party room that I didn't even know existed.  It's very spacious for any event."}
{"text":"Honey barbecue wings are amazing I would suggested getting them. I got the plain cheese burger with fries it was great.when I was full I wanted to eat more. It was that good!!!! I would rate the food 4 stars but the service was 3 stars because our waitress didn't come that often. Overall it was fantastic. I also tried there quesadilla it was ok."}
{"text":"Came in a Tuesday night, the bar staff is a bit understaff, but they manage. Appetizers: wedges, onion rings, & mac n cheese all very good. Wings were very good, ordered the sweet bbq, honey bbq, & lemon pepper. Lemon pepper is my favorite, a dry rub with a hint of lemon flavor. 1 waitress for the bar and 2 bartenders. I felt sad for the waitress, I'm glad she had runners though. Rarely saw our waitress but understandable due to the amount of help on hand. Floor is slippery so be careful not to slip."}
{"text":"This BWW location has been recently remodeled. It's bright and has a modern feel to the place.   An unfortunate aftermath of the remodel is the sewer gas smell that lingers around the bar. It's absolutely disgusting!  I'm a frequent BWW customer and used to visit this location weekly however, stopped due to the smell. After a couple months, I decided to give it a try again in hopes that the problem had been corrected...  It hasn't.   How can a restaurant chain as big as BWW allow this to go unfixed?  The bartenders are at a loss...  They tell me that people complain almost daily however nothing is being done to correct the smell.    Shame on BWW for forcing their employees to work in an environment like this."}
{"text":"The Thursday bartender, Matt is awesome! Super friendly and engaging!  Food is typical BWW good.  Sounds crazy but temperature in the bar area is way too cold. It might be 115 outside but way too cold inside."}
{"text":"The bar service in this restaurant is horrific!  I am a frequent Buffalo Wild Wings Customer (more than once a week).  I typically visit the BWW in Henderson near the Galleria Mall.  The bar tenders (Megan, Jen, Steph and Tanya) are exceptional!  The bar service in this location is amongst the worst I have ever experienced.  The bar tender is typically too busy doing what appears to be nothing to be concerned with her customers.  I have recently had occasion to visit this location and both times have left feeling as though I was an inconvenience to the bartender.   Unfortunately, I do not know her name as it is never on the check.   The food is good and is consistent with all BWW locations.  Don't expect much in the lines of service if you sit at the bar.  I won't go back for more torture."}
{"text":"I visit this location more than once a week.  The bartenders (Megan, Jen, Steph & Tanya) at this location are all top notch!   I usually don't get to my seat before the bartender is pouring my beer and waiting for me to decide where to land.  My beer is NEVER empty, the food is always good,  the service is AMAZING!  Hats off to BWW Henderson Galleria...."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever been to a Buffalo Wild Wings. My husband was craving it so we went. Let's just say I will never be back. We ordered a large of spicy boneless wings and a large sweet. We got 2 large spicy and therefore I didn't get to eat. The server apologized and said she would give us a large sweet to go. Really to go! So I sat and watched my husband eat dinner. I got water! Finally the server brought me carrots and celery. Wahoo! That's one way to help me with my diet. I probably won't be back ."}
{"text":"If you go here around 2 am and see a bald guy by the name ED working the bar leave right away ! He is so rude it's sickening ! A group and friends and myself went here on this past Saturday, he Asked us what we wanted to drink . My entire party did not hear him so he yelled at us DO U WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK with the biggest attitude . It was weird but we brushed it off , then when he took our food order he got down to my little brother and asked him what he wanted to order. As my brother looks at the menu and says \"i would like the ..\" the bald man yells \"I GUESS NOT \" and stormed off . We were so disturbed we walked out . Mind u we did not receive our food yet .  His customer service is so horrible we walked out . Give them out money for what ? As we walked out he litterally sprints after us as we are leaving and tells us \"GET THE F** OUT !! YOU ARE ALL 86'd ALL OF YOU \" we are like woah man what's your problem??? We spoke to the sup who was on duty about the man's terrible customer service and attitude. Another man that we did not know entered our convo and said he was rude as well . I feel talking to her didn't do anything at all . She didn't seem to care . NOT ONLY ARE THEY SLOW BUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE !! The way he was charging towards us really scared me and made me feel as if he was going to attack us . NEVER AGAIN !!!"}
{"text":"Sigh. Three stars because the food is solid, what you would expect from a chain wing place and usually tasty.   The service though is slooooooow. I've been here for lunch many times and each time I think maybe I caught them on an off day.. after all the place can get crowded at lunch time. I was mistaken. I showed up for lunch a little earlier than usual and the place was dead. There was one other table of two in the place. And still.. waited to be greeted and seated...waited for a server.... waited for drinks.. waited for a check. The servers are nice but it seems to take forever for anything to happen. I always figured that maybe they were short staffed during the lunch rush but there were probably four or five other servers hanging out by the to-go area today. I didn't see our server hanging out with them so maybe she was busy in the bar area but jeez!  Again I've never had rude service, my order had never been wrong and the food is to be expected so I wouldn't trash the place. It's solid and they have a good lunch deal. Just be prepared that it might take a little longer than you'd like your lunch break to be."}
{"text":"The smell is much better! Service has improved and the kids are excited to eat. Looking forward to happy hour!   The wing special is a great deal!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big Buffalo Wild Wings fan, being from the east coast I prefer Quaker Steak and Lube. But this particular location I will give four stars. The wings were great and the service was awesome. We went for a late night going away party for my manager and they were attentive, polite, and fun. I see myself going back to this location again."}
{"text":"Food is always good, tried new flavor, cherry sting, it's good. There are plenty of TV's to watch 'the game' and the servers are very attentive, but, tonight there was way too much 'attention'!  We've seen their captains before, going around introducing themselves, asking if they can get us anything, making sure we are having a good time etc.....  But, there ste times when you just want to eat the wings and watch the game without all the goodhearted interuptions!  Not only was our server eager to share her visit back home for the Thanksgiving holiday and reunion with her military boyfriend, but she stopped by about a dozen times asking if 'you guys are ok', plus two captains made the rounds as well as the manager? For a couple that just wanted wings and to watch ULNV/ASC game, we were interupted way too much!  So, expect a lot of attention when you go. Food is good, service is good, games are good, when you're not interupted! Maybe they should consider a 'no bother' sign to flip when service isn't needed!"}
{"text":"Crazy place with big screen TVs covering every game.  Loud crowds, a buzz in the air, its a fun place to hang out, have a few beers and eat some wings.  There are many different wet sauces and several dry rub choices to pick from.  The \"hotness\" ranges from mild, just barely a burn to the hottest habanaro sauce.    Wings are cooked as ordered, takes a while to get them but service is quick, the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"Love bwws. We try to come at least once a week and love having the usual waiter! Even remembers Sammy's name :) good wings and good beer!"}
{"text":"I have been confronted by manager several times when I have had my service dog with me but never as rudely as I was at Buffalo wild wings by a manager to claim his name was Derrick   They were very rude they came up and just said that we could not have a dog in the area without asking about him being a service dog when he clearly has a vest with markings on it  This is a restaurant that we have been to several times but I can guarantee we will never be going back there again"}
{"text":"The wife and I have come here often and have always enjoyed the hot tasty food as well as good service.  They have plenty of tv's so you can watch your favorite team."}
{"text":"With over a dozen sauces to choose from for your chicken wings....the problem is what to choose?  The waitress was very accomodating and gave us samples of many of the sauces.  An added BONUS to this particular restaurant is the 24/7 hours of operation.  Although I may never be there in the wee hours of the morning, it is nice to know when I am in the area, there is an awesome place for buffalo wings.  We ordered 18 wings with Medium, Asian Zing, Caribbean Jerk, and Parmesan Garlic assortment of sauces.  Also my friend also ordered the \"Buffalito Tacos\" with her choice of any sauce, but she chose the standard BBQ sauce.  Granted we both ordered water for our drinks, the cost of everything including tip was below $25 for two....NOT BAD!  If you are fan of buffalo wings like I am.....you will enjoy Buffalo Wild Wings whichever restaurant you choose.  I can't wait to go again!  (Sidenote:  I  found out from the waitress that Buffalo Wild Wings is a large franchise chain that still has to creep into the Orange County area.  Until then, the Chino Hills or Rancho Cucamonga area will have to do.  But for this review, I reviewed the Montecito-North Las Vegas restaurant.)"}
{"text":"I don't get why some people love this place so much. Any location I've ever been to has the SLOWEST service. Came on a Thursday night and we weren't told about the special for the day, I had to ask. I ordered spicy garlic and asian zing. The spicy garlic was in a tomato based sauce, I didn't like it at all. Drinks took forever to come out, I noticed it's because the waitress was the one making drinks while the bartenders were.... idk..."}
{"text":"Service was fine BUT food was horrible. Chicken wrap was dry, chips stale, wings were way over sauced. Then to top it off we asked for the veggie sticks and were charged .60 twice! Geez.  They didn't say there would be a charge for that. Sigh...oh well why did I expect any more than what we got? Lesson learned..."}
{"text":"Hostess is probably the reason I gave this place a 2 stars. First off we walked in.. the place was about 40% full. I asked the hostess if we could possibly wait for a booth. Her response \"umm we are like really busy right now..\" I wonder if this was her first night working because it was not busy and there were at least 2 booths available 1 was dirty and there was an empty one where an EMPLOYEE was using it to charge her phone. Just saying I know what busy looks like.. busy is usually a football game or some sport event happening. Anyways she said we'd have to wait which we told her we didnt mind in the first place. We get seated. Everything comes like 30 mins later. Cold fries. We ordered an appetizer which we received with the food? Usually that comes out first. Servers were helpful but they definitely shouldn't put lazy liars in the front."}
{"text":"Delicious wings yet I find the service to be very inconsistent. If you are a sports fanatic and enjoy watching a good game then this is your place. What I don't like is the discrepancy in wing prices between the boneless wings and the regular ones...I really think that's a bunch of crap...I don't care if the boneless wings are cheaper, I just don't like them. I much prefer the regular ones as they are much more full of flavor. Anyway, it's my opinion and I'm sticking to it!"}
{"text":"I could not belive how dirty and smelly this place was ridiculous. Smelled like throw up the floors were filled with trash. I sat down in water and food and wing sauce all on the table and seats. from the start we weren't even asked what drinks we wanted had to wait 15 minutes for that then 10 minutes later they came to saying they had no more boneless wings ?? On a Friday night ??? A wing place ??? Never again am I coming to this DIRTY Buffalo Wild Wings"}
{"text":"Im a BWW regular just in different locations because i travel. This location is 5/5. Good food and service. Only drawback is very limited parking."}
{"text":"I come here all the time so this review is long overdue....  Great Food, Great Service, Great Staff!!!  The food here is always great.  The service at this location can take a little longer than one may hope but that's the choice you make when going to a sports bar during a major sporting event. (of course the food will take longer when the restaurant is full of fans)  We sat at the bar and ordered our food.  I asked the bartender if she could change one of the screens to the hockey game.  She was very attentive and did it almost immediately.  She also continued to check on us to make sure we were happy with everything.   Will continue to be a frequent patron at this location.  BTW: Captain Morgan sauce is back!!!  It says for a limited time only so I hope to get my fix before its gone!"}
{"text":"Happy hour Moscow Mules with hot pretzels served up by Ace was great. She was upbeat with a great smile. Loved that she explained how to utilize the Blazin Rewards app."}
{"text":"Monday night football this is where you need to be. Women every where at every turn, dj playing music during half time and after the game. Staff is always helpful, food is always good, hot, and fast.  If your looking for some where quite during the game this is not for you, but if you want to watch sports on like 40 different tvs and mingle then see you on Monday night during the games."}
{"text":"Best place to watch the game with out a lot of random shit going on behind you... Get a cold tall boy and sit back and enjoy wings pretty good to..."}
{"text":"This review is simply to recognize amazing service PERIOD that I'm sure would match a dine in service.  We just moved to the area and apparently a nail caused a flat tire which brought us parked next to this location.    While my husband was changing out the tire a crew member came out with a cold bottle of water and said something like \"I can see you're having a bad day..here you go!\" when asked what his name was he introduced himself as Jeff, the manager.   If the manager is as stand up as this with non patrons, imagine the service you get when you visit this BWW!! :)  We will definitely be stopping in soon!  Thanks so much Jeff!"}
{"text":"This Bdubs has been around since I was young and I have been here many many times.  This last time we decided to go and eat after the Vegas Golden Knights game this past weekend.   We arrive around 9pm and it was not that busy. We knew what we wanted to eat so it didn't take long.   We ordered an appetizer to start. Fried pickles, spinach/ artichoke dip with chips, and baked tenders.   We also ordered our wings and a basket of fries to share.   We expected the appetizer to come out first as that's how it usually happens.   Instead, we received our wings first, then our fries and then eventually our appetizer.   I was pretty disappointed seeing as how everything arrived after the wings. I didn't even get my dipping sauce until after the appetizer was there.   After eating the appetizer, we took all the rest of the food home feeling meh.  I've had better service and attention to detail at other locations.   This ones a mehhhhh."}
{"text":"If you can't find me on a Monday night during football season, you don't need to put out an APB, my ass is glued to a bar stool in B Dubs. I've been coming to this location for 6 years and have been frequenting BWW across the country for over 20 years. Their motto is \"wings, beer, sports.\" If you're into those things, then B Dubs is for you.  We're here every Monday night and occasionally for other sporting events such as NFL playoffs, the college football playoff championships, and most recently, the NCAA national championship basketball game. On Mondays, they have drawings for two jerseys, one for each team playing. They carry all sports packages and show UFC fights also.  Brandi is our cocktail, Jason is the bartender, and CJ is the GM. They all make sure we are well taken care of. Brandi brings us beers without asking and she makes sure we get all of our orders in before happy hour ends. She knows my food order when I'm ready: snack size traditional wild wings, all flats, with a side of carrots. The wild sauce is the second hottest sauce and has the perfect kick for me. Jason is one of the hardest working bartenders I've seen and can handle a full bar on his own.  During happy hour, they have $3 apps and $3 tall domestic drafts. I'll usually start off with some roasted garlic mushrooms or chili con queso dip, They have a couple good sampler appetizers and the cheese curds are fantastic when you eat them when they're nice and hot. I could also munch on mini corn dogs and potato wedges all night. During lunch, they have great valued combos.  I understand not everyone has VIP experiences like we do because we are regulars. But to increase your chance of having an enjoyable experience, I would sit at the bar or cocktail area if everyone is over 21. The cocktail will usually be able to run circles around a server in the dining area. Avoiding peak hours or grabbing a seat early before big events should also enhance your experience.  Unless they stop serving wings or all the beer taps break, you'll always find me in a B Dubs."}
{"text":"After reading a few yelp reviews I hesitated in going to this location, but still gave it a chance because it's the closest yo my home...I have to say the service was GREAT! Jade was our server (we sat in the bar area), she was quick, friendly, approachable and attentive.    So I wanted to drop in and write a review to offset some of the \"bad service\" reviews placed on here.  The food hasn't changed..chicken gud ....and it's even better when it's wing Tuesday (can't beat that price!) So with that, I gave the place 4 stars!   I'm very stingy with my 5s :)."}
{"text":"One word can explain the burger quality, size considering around 10 dollars price, 'TERRIBLE'. Simply the WORST I've ever eaten in last 10 years. In addition to refried boneless wings that was not fresh at all!... I neither got the taste of chicken in other words let me put it this way, when I've eaten alligator the first time, it tasted more like a chicken than boneless wings in BWW. As a person who used to go to BWW minimum of once per week will never step in there for sure... You want to just watch sports and drink beer with chips then this place might be an option to go if all other sports bar in town got burned down!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service, such unfriendly employees. especially our server, Cody, was very rude, unprofessional, and so unwelcoming. he basically sat us down, asked for our order, brought our food and then disappeared. never topped our drinks, just came to ask us if we could close the tab. i would've appreciated an employee who didn't get upset or rolled his eyes when asked something."}
{"text":"This is the worst Buffalo Wild Wings ever! The service is fine but the food taste gross! If you want AWESOME wings there are plenty of other options out there. Wish I could support this place but honestly, how do you make garlic parm wings taste horrible ?!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 0 stars!!! Don't go in there if you're a minority, part of the lgbt community or both. Waited forever patiently and couldn't even get water. The bartender was a complete asshole and was rude and disrespectful. After a 45 min wait we decided to leave since we didn't even get drinks and saw others that came in after us getting serviced. The bartender got upset because we were leaving while waiting for our food. When we tried to explain that we didn't even get drinks he said he had other customers to service. Never going back to this place again!! So unprofessional... We understand that places get busy, but he was not apologetic or partially attentive to our group."}
{"text":"Yet another overdue review of a place I've been coming to for the past 5 years.  I can't say I've had flawless experiences here. I'm certain that when they opened I got food poisoning. However, a couple months after I came back and ordered the same thing and continued to order the same thing. I really don't like food poisoning, but their wings are pretty amazing, so I came back.  There's been lots of staff changes over the years, but currently the place functions quite quickly. The staff are friendly, attentive and fast. Though I did have a bit of a disagreement with the GM about speed one night because it took 30 minutes to get my takeout, but I got a gift card, so I was happy! Haha.  Let's get into the food. Starting off with fries and wedges. Fries here are my least favourite fries ever. They are like a cross between a potato and cardboard, then sliced up like fries. I would not eat them willingly. Luckily, I come here for wings and St. Louis wings for fries. The wedges on the other hand are pretty fantastic. They're definitely close to Tim Horton's wedges, which are my favourite of all the wedges. Portion wise it's great. Oh and the sweet potato fries are fantastic.  Next up, Fried Pickles. Delicious, delicious fried pickles. They're gone as soon as they get to the table and I think next time I need to order two. They're crispy on the outside, a bit of crunch on the inside and they're always so hot, freshly fried. But what makes them amazing is the dipping sauce. I think it's a southwestern ranch. It's amazing. Did I say that already? If you like fried pickles, you won't regret ordering them.  Main course, the wings! So I personally don't order boneless because they're all glutenous and I can't gluten. But I've been told they're pretty great. Also something I learned over the years, you can order all flats or all drums (I'm an all flats person). I would have to recommend mixing sauces, because you can and it's better that way. But you have to specify that they're mixed and not two separate sauces. My personal favourite is Honey Garlic/BBQ and Kickin' Honey Garlic. Though the latter is great on its own. The mild is also fantastic. All are great with ranch sauce.  Oh lastly, Buzztime. It's a game you can play on your phone or with a tablet they give you. It's a ton of fun while you're waiting for your food. It's no HQ, but it's still quite fun."}
{"text":"Live down the street from this place and h available e been going there since they opened.  Great food and wings are unbeatable by any other wing place. However I watched the prices slowly creep up and up and up to the point I simply couldn't spend my money here anymore. My wife and I would go here every Friday after work and order would consist of 6 pack of wings each, shared potato wedges on a few beers. We watch our bill go from approximately 30 dollars to approximately 65 dollars and we said we're gone. We still stop buy from time to time and see that the prices are still up there."}
{"text":"During my last trip to Vegas, I ate here two times. For food on the strip you are either going to eat mediocre food or pay tons of money for slightly better than mediocre food. Well Buffalo Wild Wings cut all that out. You get decent wings for a decent price and sits right off the strip near shops by Planet Hollywood casino.  The service here on this trip and my last two trips has been hit or miss. I will admit most times was a hit which is reassuring.   There is plenty of seating and the bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time at about 10:30pm on a Saturday. It was quiet, but that's Surprise for you, I suppose. The waiter was nice but forgot to give us silver wear. The wings were a lot bigger and a lot better quality than other BWWs I've been to. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Always eat at the bar you'll get better service and your food will come out in time. You have to pick and choose the time you come here anytime in the evening is a No as the crowd gets rowdy and the servers disappear in the back chit chatting. It's very clear that management has a type of server they like to hire young pretty with attitude and no customer service training. Maybe if they focused more on customer service they would attract a more mature crowd and they could make more of a profit on big sporting events such as boxing and UFC events. This is one of the only BW3 that doesn't order these PPV events because of the crowd it'll attract. Management definitely needs to pull it together."}
{"text":"This is only my second time at this location and will be my last. On wing night they only had two servers and one was training another, servicing the entire place. It took 5-10 minutes just to be seated even with management walking past the line of us needing to be seated. It was quickly decided to order drinks and food together so we wouldn't have to wait forever. Thankfully the food was hot and came out fairly quick but no refills on drinks etc as again they were taking care of the whole restaurant. Not blaming the servers, I just believe that if management cared enough or focused on service this location wouldn't be such a terrible place."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere especially if you come here during Football time but for the wings I prefer Wingstop. Service was ok but they initially forgot our fries."}
{"text":"This has come to be my local.  I first came in before I moved here, when I was working out details for moving here.  I noticed it on my way to the hotel, so I figured I'd go, since I knew the name, but had never been in one.  Like a previous poster, I had dealt with Neilly.  She was my first experience after hopping up to the bar.  She was very welcoming, friendly, and gave some good suggestions as well. When realizing that the next night would be the NFL opening Sunday, I knew where I'd be watching the games that weekend.  The wings were decent, though not the best I've had (that still goes to Boogies in Winnipeg, biggest wings I've ever had are there).  Good selection of beer, and when a new one comes in they've always been quick to point it out, and give out a sample.  As mentioned before, Tuesdays are wing nights, and Thursdays are boneless wing nights, and there is usually something for everyone with the 30 flavours.  Over the months I've got to know the staff (including management) and they've all been more than friendly and attentive (except one, who is no longer working there). I come in with friends, and they always enjoy it, and I come in alone when I just want to grab a pint and watch a game on a bigger TV than I have.  Which is another great feature.  You're never going to come in here and be stuck watching something.  If your team is playing, but there is UFC on as well, they will get you a TV with your game.  In fact, they've told me they have a mandate to have multiple sports on at the same time.  They'll put the sound on for you if it's not already on another event, or if it's a big event, rather than being stuck listening to the juke box.   They also always seem very accommodating when large groups are coming in, and always seem to be able to fit people in at a table somewhere!  A definite plus is the covered patio with TVs on it, it was great for playoff hockey!"}
{"text":"Server was nice but dissappeared for 30 minutes.  So we got our sampler platter, our salad came out two minutes later and our meal came out two minutes after that (so yes, we're sitting there with all our food in a matter of 5 minutes).  I didn't know you could mess up nachos, until I ordered them at BWW. In short, the food was terrible. Chicken in the chicken tacos was hard, dry, and cold. Never. Going. Back."}
{"text":"The bar here is too slow to deliver your orders. At the least give us a glass of water or the drinks that we ordered first. We cancelled our orders and left...went to Hooters and guess what, upon sitting down at the table we were given glasses of water and fast delivery of our orders.   This place needs to retrain their employees."}
{"text":"This is not a bad review for b dubs in general, just this location.  Firstly, there's hardly enough sauce on the wings, especially compared to other b dubs around Madison.  Secondly, I got takeout once and ordered 20 boneless wings.  The box felt very light so I decided to count as I ate.  Just 12.  I know they're by weight and not number, but this wasn't even close.  Next time I decided to sit down inside instead of getting takeout.  Got significantly shortchanged again.  I think I'll just go somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"Not bad not bad.  Lots of TV's to watch sports on.  There was a ton of people in here during lunchtime which caused our service to slow down considerably [like trying to pay and go back to work].  I got a grilled chicken salad it was good enough not the best I've ever had but it did the trick.    I'll go back to try it again just to watch football on their huge screens!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of their regular wings, I only come here for their boneless wings, which are usually drenched in sauce and fried to a crisp. It's weird but I'll even eat it cold the next day because they just stay so crispy and good.   I usually get my food to go because service can be a hit or miss, but tonight, I had a wonderful server. I forget her name but despite it being so busy (65 cent boneless wings on Thursdays) she was super nice and attentive without being suffocating."}
{"text":"Hate giving a bad review since this is where our family has been going for many years, but the most recent visit this evening and during Christmas break we all have had gotten upset stomachs.  The burgers taste differently.  Even though we love playing the games and watching sports we now have to find another place.  Something is different in the taste in burgers.  Bummed."}
{"text":"*shudder*- It never feels good to spend a hefty sum of money only to feel ripped off and disgusting on the inside. That's what has happened the two times I've been here.   My fish tacos had very bland Cheap ingredients. Super bland. My boyfriends burger? Huge patty, tiny, cheap crappy bun. The fried  mushroom appetizer we got was an unfunny joke that came on a tiny paper bowl thing , about 3/4 of a cup of them to share between four people. And they were gross. The French fries are the SALTIEST you will ever taste. Hmm, I wonder why that is? Maybe so you'll be likely to Order more BEER? Blech.   Prices are ridiculous. Service is just okay. Atmosphere is TOO MUCH with the many oversized television screens. Good for game days and avoiding small talk with your dining-mates!   Really though, This place is an abomination."}
{"text":"Had to go service on new years eve after the fiesta bowl (one block away)  Service: fast and friendly   Food: quite tasty   To go area: very convenient"}
{"text":"One of the pleasant surprises I got being an out-of-town visitor to this place was that the waitress provided me a food allergen list for me to look at! I am gluten sensitive and dairy gives me rashes. The list was a chart that was easy to comprehend and showed what common allergens are in what dishes.   I ordered wings that did not contain gluten plus some salsa with chips. I also had a pinot with my order. There were well over 35 of us (large training group from most of the Canadian major cities with my representing Vancouver), so I understood that my order would take a while.   Wait staff were friendly and attentive. It was a fun time had by all. The restaurant was spacious and had an upbeat casual mood."}
{"text":"This is the third or fourth time visiting here and would be the last.  I can NOT take the snippy attitude your waitresses and your hostesses have, seriously do something!  I get it that they may be dealing with kids all day long being in Tempe but you also have grown up customers that don't appreciate a 20 year old talking to them in a snippy way.  I mean what's your deal???   No one is even smiling at this place.  You suck, if I had a zero I would give you a zero :/  Asked for a refill on the water, I got a glass with no ice just warm water and slammed it on the table, I COULD NOT believe it :(  Never felt like a burden before especially when I was spending my money, at this bww they make feel that.  I can also tell there is a click of waitresses hating their life and arguing by the computer/flat screen where they place the orders, they were pointing on tables and arguing, not a pleasant professional way, you made me feel very uncomfortable when you pointed at me!  You know, I was just there to eat late night with a business partner that was it, we were not there to do anything else, you left a bitter taste in our mouth.  This review exclude a gentlemen named Bryant, he was running to get me the water and the beer the waitress forgot and was extremely nice and asked if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"Go for the wings. Stick to the wings. Traditional at that, and, you will be happy. Decent beer on tap as well.   Expecting anything more from a beer and wings place is not their fault. I don't get the negative reviews. Obviously, you weren't expecting bouillabaisse. Or, were you?"}
{"text":"I was glad to see Buffalo Wild Wings take over the old Blockbuster location in Brick plaza. This place is about a kilometer from my parent's place so when I'm visiting and there's a Flames game on, I know where to go when I don't want to be somewhere obnoxious like Schanks.   While BWW's wings aren't cheap, they are nice and meaty and they have a big selection of sauces and seasonings. If you're looking for a cheap wing night with some friends, then stick to what ever pub you normally go to because this probably isn't for you. However, i you're looking for a reliable place to get good wings any night of the week and catch a game, then this is the place to come.  They have other food on the menu like burgers and salads. I tried a salad at another location in California and found it to be quite tasty. At this location I tried their burger lunch special which was meh, but on another night with my parents we had the nachos and they were hearty.  I try to get a taste of a wing sauce I haven't tried before every time I come. On the hotter end of the scale the sauces are good an pack a punch, but they're not going to fry your tastebuds and their blazin' sauce doesn't even come close to Duff's Armageddon sauce. I think the only bomb I've found on the menu so far was their garlic parmesan sauce. It was basically caesar salad dressing. It wasn't terrible, just not my cup of tea.  Service has always been excellent on each of my visits."}
{"text":"Was just in last night for dinner with my wife, 6 week old son and sister in law. Had to wait for a table (which we expected, Friday night at 7:30). All the staff was friendly and the place looks great! Music was kind of loud but I enjoyed it. When my son started to wake up and cry, no one knew because they couldn't hear him over the music!  Really like that you have a touch tunes juke box (I was able to play the music I wanted to hear!), wide selection of beers and the wings were really good (I'm a nny fan, still say nny is the best but still liked these). They have TVs everywhere and would love to go on a Sunday to watch football! Only reason it's not 5 stars is I felt the kitchen was slow to get our wings out. Apps came out quick but wings took a little long. Matthew our server was solid. Seemed new but I think everyone there is. Also, I got blue cheese instead of ranch with my wings. Gross!  For apps, we got cheese curds and fried pickles. Both really good. I ordered traditional hot and spicy garlic. I go here for the spicy garlic, it's amazing! Wife and sister in law shared boneless wings. They had no complaints.  Overall, we had a great experience!"}
{"text":"I went to the Oshawa location and I'm going to the Ajax location tonight! I really liked there wings, I had a black cherry moquito and the Hot BBQ wings with Extra sauce on the wings (I love my wings smothered in sauce, he he). I also had these nachos, I forgot what kind they were but it had meat and cheese and Pico de galo smothered all over it and hands down, Best nachos I've ever had! Going tonight to get the same thing! Lol :P"}
{"text":"BDubs!!!! My favorite place for bar food, the mini corn dogs are awesome, best wings around, I honestly love everything on the menu from every appetizer to all their menu items, this is the only place I have ever eaten where I try a new item every time!  Service is always attentive and polite, I have been going to the Chandler fashion location for years and have seen most of the same staff during that time. Great place to go before catching a movie at the theater."}
{"text":"Im an airline pilot and eat out a ton. So believe me when I say this location has some of the worst service Ive ever had anywhere. My girlfriend and I stopped in to get some wings and a beer. Had to flag down the bartender to get anything while another employee was eating behind the bar and what I assume was another bartender counted his money. We were completely ignored for about 10 minutes until I said something while the bartender walked by. It wasnt even busy. The place was literally at least half empty yet there were people waiting for a table even though there were many servers just standing around. We sat at the bar hoping to get faster service but to say it was slow would be a gross understatement. Nobody could be bothered to take our orders for food or drinks. We ordered a bunch of really spicy wings and sat there for an eternity with our mouths burning while we waited for someone to come by to get us even a water refill. We sat there trying to close out for a good 15-20 minutes when someone who later identified himself as a manager came by. I asked him to close out and expressed how terrible we had been served/not served and he couldnt care any less. He gave a meaningless apology and told us he would have the bartender close us out. I told him we had already waited long enough and wanted him to do it. He lazily sauntered over and closed us out. He gave some meaningless apology and said he had never heard anyone say that before. Based on the prior reviews he is clearly out of touch with reality. WHERE IS B DUBS CORORATE MANAGEMENT???"}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday with my family. The wings are 75 cents on a Tuesday so we got three different flavours spicy garlic, honey bbq and bbq as sides we had fried pickles and fries and strawberry lemonades to drink. The wings were very delicious my kids usually dont clean there bones but this time they did. Fries were good the pickles were ok but not our favorite they were kind of clumped together , the strawberry lemonde was the best I ever had a little to sweet but amazing flavour with real strawberries inside the drink. Would for sure go back."}
{"text":"Always get the best service here at lunch time.  Katrina and Christina are my favorites.  The food is always really good ."}
{"text":"First things first: every Buffalo wild wings I've ever been to trumps the wings and service at Hooters. I don't understand people that say they prefer Hooters over BWW.  Most importantly are the wings. I don't know what kind of scrappy chickens Hooters sources their wings from, but Buffalo's wings are almost twice as big.  The food overall seems comparable in taste and quality across states. We got a sampler with three different kinds and loved every single flavor of wing. I actually ended up eating most of it because my friend has a stomach sleeve and can't eat much. More for me!  I had no problem with the wait or the service, even though it was a Saturday night. I honestly don't see anything wrong with the place except for the large amounts of people that seem to dress up like it's a fancy restaurant. It was really... weird (especially the ladies in sparkly and skimpy dresses).  My friend said it's because BWW is all people have to go to out here lol. That's pretty sad. Either way, a lot of the reviews seem hit or miss, but I think it's worth the risk for some good wings."}
{"text":"I went with a buddy for lunch and WOW horrible.  We got seated and waited 15 minutes before even being asked for beverages.  Finally after getting our drinks our orders got taken.  I ordered the Buffalo Ranch Chicken sandwich.  I'm sorry but it tasted just like something I could have gotten at Chick Fil A for a third of the price.  I was totally not impressed.    I have had wings before at another BWW and they were good so I know not everything is bad but I wouldn't order anything but wings from now on.  That is if I ever go back.  Native New Yorker has better wings so it's tough to want to go to a BWW in the future."}
{"text":"This place is really more for the beer and wings crowd they pander to. On game night it is always packed, and service is unreasonably slow both at the tables and the bar.  The last time I was here was with my best friend, who had befriended the bartender and demanded that I tag along and enjoy the drinks that the two of the came up with. Well, us not caring about pop sport culture did not know it was a game night, and so struggled to find seats at the bar. Her friend the bartender took a while to get us our drinks, which was fine since he had to service the whole place. But then came the food fiasco. First, it took fifteen minutes for us to put in our order. Then it took twenty minutes for the order to go through. Which isn't all that bad considering, but the thing was, we only ordered appetizers. I got fried pickles and she got the sampler plate. I was approached by a waiter with two baskets of fried pickles who asked me if I had order some. I said yes, and they gave me a basket. Turns out the people next to us had ordered two baskets of fried pickles. I basically just jacked their pickles. I didn't know this until much, much, much later when my friend got her plate and they gave me another basket of fried pickles. The bill was only for one as well. I seriously hope those people didn't end up paying for two. Overall their burgers and wings aren't excellent, it's really the sauce and fifty TVs they have there that keep people coming."}
{"text":"Terrible. No wonder it's always empty.   I didnt even bother to finish my wings. They were over cooked and seem like it's been out all day. Stale,stiff, hard,no taste. I'm sure dipping my wings in water wouldn't have even help.   One star for their nachos, not bad"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Came here for a few brews with the chaps and our waitress Carlee made our night one for the books! She provided our beers and food in a very timely matter. The lads and I had a splendid time. We enjoyed a wonderful platter of chili queso and fried pickles for our appetizers. 5 stars, definitely recommend!!! Ask to sit in Carlee's section"}
{"text":"Love coming to BWW for the Tuesday specials and the service. Whenever we go we always make sure to say hi to the manager there named GRANT   He is always so nice and friendly. Honestly he's the reason we go to this BWW. We live across the street from the one on Hualapai but we'll drive a couple extra minutes to get better service."}
{"text":"Ambiance: open 24 hours, spacious inside, large rounded rectangle shape bar table with mini slot machines and side tables  Service: only one server for the entire place at late night, so very slow  Food: standard taste   Onion Rings - *** average taste   Spicy Garlic - *** not very spicy   Mango Habanero - **** sweet and spicy   Buffalo - **** medium   Bourbon Honey Mustard - *** sweet  Price: large portions and decent prices, about $15~$20 each"}
{"text":"I give it 4stars but it gets a little crazy because they have so many TVS to watch the games on so if you have bets parlayed you can watch them all at once. Me and my hub went there today after first heading to sunset casino for football sunday. The casino was way to packed and we didnt want to stand. We headed to buffalo wild wings and there was one booth open staring right at us. lol We had previously had a large breakfast so we just ordered a snack of chips and salsa. The chips are nice and light, crunchy, & not super greasy. The salsa has a slight spice to it and chunky tomatoes. Perfect for us. Flavored lemonades are a yummy choice too but wash it down with water so you can cut the sugar intake. The downside was the irresponsible parents literally letting their ypung children run and roam through the restaurant freely! You cannot get so distracted from a game that you forget you are a parent and let your children disrupt other peoples space. One young girl continuosly came by our booth grabbing onto our table. Mind you I love kids but there Is a time and a place, and they were all up in our space. I though the establishment should have said something to the parents. Besides that the waiter was pleasant but asked us one too many times if we wanted to order more food. Apparently he didnt like pur small order of chips but it does get pretty loud in there. A bit too crowded with lots of tables close to eachother. Men and football is all ill say. Too much lol but it worked for the day."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout tonight. When calling the server was very attentive and friendly. I ordered a chicken wrap and the pick up time was very reasonable. The checkout process was smooth and the server made sure my additional sources were in the bag and extra napkins and utensils were in the bag since I'm in hotel.  I will definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"I just posted in corporate website and here as well , too bad I'm not going back anymore , base on not having customer service and people with bad actitud"}
{"text":"Honestly, that one star was only given because the server was very caring. So keep it up Matt! The food on the other hand was pretty... nah, reaaally upsetting. My fries were not only super dry but hard as a rock, in hopes of the tenders being juicy per usual, they were also ridiculously dry. I'm so bummed about this. If it weren't for me being super hungry and having sympathy over Matt serving numerous guests and being alone I would have honestly said something. I'm only here to warn people that if you experience a similar situation, PLEASE say something so you won't have to go home with a sore jaw like myself.   Also just for future reference, take off the expiration sticker on the lids of your ranch before serving them. Not too happy knowing 2 different ranches given were 4 days apart and 1 being almost a week old.. which was quite obvious by the sour taste."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service.  Made us feel welcome.  Great fun atmosphere.  Daughter's favorite restaurant!  Highly recommend this BDubs!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome!    Our waiter was adorable!  I had chicken Street tacos, the gals had wings.  We shared nachos,  did not care for the kettle chip nachos.  The honey BBQ sauce was gross.  We asked for it to be on the side, wish the waiter would have came and told us as a new item nothing can be changed we would have passed.  The rest was good."}
{"text":"I have been to the Surprise location several times; service has been slow some of the times, and right on spot this last time. I had the fish street tacos from the Happy Hour menu, they were grilled, and had a smokey taste that was very yummy. My spouse had his usual blend of wings/3 flavors and I tried a small piece of each one, they too were very moist and yummy. I am sure we will be back as my other half likes this place better than I do, but, its the only time he gets his wing \"fix\". So all in all, I give a solid 3 stars!"}
{"text":"We came to Buffalo Wings for a late dinner.  We were seated right away, our waitress arrived at our table shortly after... She was very friendly.  The atmosphere was great, it wasn't too busy.  The restaurant was clean. I ordered garlic parmesan wings. The wings were nice and plumped, well seasoned and delicious!! Yes, I would definitely come back to this Buffalo Wild Wings!!"}
{"text":"Wings, Beers and Sports  Buffalo Wild Wings would and should makes any guys happy.... Any even I am a happy camper during my visit!   TV all around showing basketballs, hockey and more... Never a boring moment!   If you not into sports, you can also play interactive poker and trivia games against other patrons.   If you are still bored or sucks in games, use their open Wifi and Yelp..   Of course there are beers and wings and more. LOVE their snack option that able to have an order of 5 and try different Flavour. FYI, blazin the hottest one on the menu is Not too hot. We also tried Mango Haberno and Buffalo flavors.   Tuesday 60 cents wings anyone?   Or there are all sort of specials..."}
{"text":"Had a small wait due to Sunday Football but was seated shortly. Greeted by a seemingly nice waitress and had my order taken right away. Food came out in less than 10 minutes which was good but the woman running our food to our table did not seem to be having a good day and seemed like she had somewhere better to be. All in all, was a decent visit."}
{"text":"Ehhh... Wasn't impressed for a simple bar. For Happy Hour, a fricken strongbow in a can and a single shot of fireball was $13. And my grilled chicken sandwich was gross. Chicken was fatty. But our waiter Dave was on point and super cool! If it wasn't for Dave, I would have given this BDubs a 1."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and I had an awesome experience. The hostess acknowledged us as soon as we walked in and sat us shortly after. The server Melissa was awesome she rec commend alot of products to us and we order what she liked and it was awesome. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to watch sports and have a good time. This place has always provided great food and great service. Everyone from the servers to the bartenders to the mangers are all very friendly and will do their best to make it enjoyable. The best part is that it's only a hop,skip, and a jump from my house so it's very convenient for me (especially during football season). This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Slow, slow, slow. Our order was wrong, no mama hanger present as he was tending to the backed up kitchen. Place isn't even full, I would say steady at best. This wouldn't happen at the Winking lizard on a game day. I've never experienced a manager that would neglect customers! This will need to be addressed on a corporate level I imagine. Shameful."}
{"text":"So as a customer for close to a decade coming to Buffalo Wild Wings before their merger deal with Arby's was a medium experience at best. However we stuck with them through the merger with the new company when there were no machines for months.only to come in to the establishment and be told that everything has been changed that now they only comp beers for 2% of your gaming play. WTF. Wasn't looking for free beers. However from time to time it would be nice to get a free chicken wing or beer. Lol Too many other great bars and restaurants with gaming that don't have a problem with their customers.. However apparently their corporate b******* has corrupted them. However if you ever decide to go there crystal is a great bartender."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a work event and decided to have the Pepper Jack Steak Wrap. I will say I really enjoyed it. Not too spicy, tender steak with the right amount of guacamole, pico de gallo, and lettuce. Obviously, the fries were great, who doesn't love fries. Anyways, I am recommending this wrap, however your service lags. It's packed in here with two bartenders during happy hour. People would usually spend more money on alcohol in this joint then food, however with the service being slow at the bar due to staffing issues that's what you get.  This place definitely lost some money with our group of 25."}
{"text":"This place is fun, especially bar side with Rosa- the awesome bartender who always indulges us with lots of laughs and friendly banter. Love my wings...spicy. Chilled crown apple shots for appetizers and let the GAME begin. We came in tonight to watch the CAVS win Willoughby! :) Flat screens all around, awesome service, and Best and I are a happy pair. Wings are a solid 3 and service adds one sparkling star."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite hangouts for lunch during work. What I really like about it is that it's not really packed for a B-Dubs, so you get just the right balance of noise and energy on your lunch break.  The staff is always nice and attentive and the food is always good. Eaten here dozens of times and my black bean burger and fries always come to me just right. Love that! And they serve Coke Zero. Woo Hoo!!  I recommend this place to anyone in the area that wants the true B-Dubs experience during your lunch break from work without the evening hoopla. Now I love the B-Dubs hoopla, especially during football season. Would love to see what this location is like on a football Sunday, but I live clear across town, so doubt that will be happening anytime soon.   Great location. Eat here. Have fun!"}
{"text":"It's all about the wings!! Ok not just the wings but when a place has it in their name you have to at least try it. Buffalo Wild Wings is great for watching sporting events on tv while you grub on food. I love coming when they have specials such as wing tuesday or boneless wing thursday. I usually get together with coworkers so we can save money and have a good time. For the wings I love sweet bbq,teriyaki,mild, asian zing. I usually don't use ranch unless I try one of my friends wings since they usually like them hot. The other food on the menu is good too. Service is good though when it's a big sporting event it will be packed and take a little longer.  I give 3 stars since the food is good, the service is adequate, and they have tv to watch sports!"}
{"text":"Is Blazin' really as hot as it gets here? I don't know if I've developed some iron palate or whether it's the suits at corporate telling them that anything spicier will scare off the middle America fanny packer crowd. But that's their hottest sauce, and while it's got a robust flavor, it just doesn't come anywhere near the kind of heat I crave as the kind of capsaicin addict who's not satisfied until... well, the less said about that the better.  My point is, if you're going to be a wing place, give people a chance to really challenge their taste buds. I think even Hooters' 3 Mile Island is hotter.  That being said, I also love the Caribbean Jerk sauce even though it's barely hot at all - it's not supposed to be. The Spicy Garlic is more vinegar-based, tangy in such a way that sometimes seems more aggressive than the Blazin'. As for the Asian Zing? I didn't think it had much zing at all, it just tasted sweet. I was hoping for more soy/sesame based but I think it's more sweet & sour. Pass. Mango Habanero: could taste lots of mango, barely any habanero. Alsop ass.  The \"buffalo chips\" suffer from the same starchy, wan fate as your average steak fry.  BWW gains points for being open 24/7/365, which is nothing notable in this town until you consider that it's a buffalo wing place, and for having a staff that's always friendly. They also offer free wi-fi.  I go here all the time because it's close and convenient moreso than because it's great. But it's good enough. Probably more like 3.5 stars, but of course Yelp doesn't give that option."}
{"text":"The management and service at this place is atrocious. We called in an order and were told it would take 40 minutes. we arrived 45-minutes later and were told they were \"bagging\" the food up. 10 minutes after that, I asked if they were still bagging my food or actually \"cooking\" it. I was told they were \"bagging\" it. 10 minutes later...still no food. Meanwhile, the manager is flirting with the hostesses."}
{"text":"What a joke. I came for lunch by myself and was asked if I wanted to sit in the bar because there is open seating. Then, despite numerous waitress milling around and talking to each other, including the manager, no one took my order or even acknowledged me. After 10 minutes, I tried to ask the manager, who was behind the bar, if I could order. He ignored me so I had to go back up front to ask for a regular seat. What a bunch of dummies."}
{"text":"This is the closest location to me so we do come in quite often. Normally we have the bad luck of coming in on a event night so it's always packed. The food is okay, I've been to other locations including ones out of state and it has always been better. Hotter, crispier, etc. We have had had multiple incidents at this one, once a waitress knocked over a full glass of ice water all over my husband and on me, and rolled her eyes and muttered under her breath calling us a bad name as she walked away to get us napkins to dry off with. Another time we sat down and our server asked what we would like to drink and I said iced tea and so did my daughter and she came back 10 mins later with one glass and said that they were out on that side of the restaurant so what else did I want ( she made it a point to let me know the other tea container had some but was in the dining area). Tonight was the last straw... now I get it, I've been a server before and did it for a long time. When it's busy, it can get hard to keep up with tables, we came in at 5:40 and there was only 3 tables taken and no wait at all. Awesome! We ordered our drinks and food, received our appetizer. Here comes the food. It was soggy and cold and just gross. Our waitress never came to check on us after we received it, my husband had get up to ask someone else for ranch, another beer, and a box. I got up and got the caps for the ranch. The bathrooms were disgusting and the sink was backed up with paper towels, and 2 of the 3 toilets were not useable( someone else's body matter on the seats). My husband asked for the check from another server since our had disappeared, and low and behold our waitress showed up and threw( and I do mean threw) the check at us. My husband got up and asked someone to please take our bill so we could leave and was told no that the server had to do it. So I got up cause I saw 2 managers talking at a table and asked if one of them could help me out. I let the manager know what was going on and he pretty much blew me off. This will be the last time I ever, ever waste $100 there."}
{"text":"Overall the Buffalo WW hype is true if you are not going to the S. Las Vegas Location. The wings are great and the service is awesome at all of the other locations except this one.  If you are into hanging out at a table thirsty, hungry, and receiving no service than this is the place for you to go. Hello Management you have the worst location in town, and if you feel the traffic from the strip will keep you on the up and up I think i would rather go buy an overpriced basket of wings at ESPN Zone. Buffalo WW is a A+ your specific Location D."}
{"text":"Love this place; however, I came in today to order 10 wings. Place was not busy kinda dead. So I was promised my wings in 10 minutes. Took them almost 40 min. For 10 wings. Very very sad. Wasn't the first time this has happened to me here. Happens again I will stop coming here."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff. All the sports you could want and no hassles no matter what game you'd like to see. Food is consistently mediocre, poor quality, uninspired, and overpriced."}
{"text":"Don't order online.   Ordered for a 4:30 pickup. Our food was placed under the heaters according to the receipt at 4:23.  Went to go pick up the food and made eye contact with a few people at exactly 4:30.  Wasn't acknowledged for some time.  Received my food at 4:38.   Yay cold food."}
{"text":"So, I'm usually not the biggest fan of wings, but there are semi limited options on my eating plan that allow me to eat out, so lately I have been coming here for \"Wing Tuesday\".  On Tuesdays, wings are half off!  I place my order online, drive down, pick them up and then grub them in my car.  Service has been fantastic at this particular BWW.  My order has been ready on time, every single time, and I have always been greeted with a smile.  On to the wings........  I usually order a small order of wings with medium sauce.  You get 10 wings coated in their tasty Buffalo sauce.  When you order online, you can even customize your order to some extent (You can pick one option such as \"extra crispy\", or \"all drumsticks\", or \"light sauce\" etc.  I am a big fan of drumsticks, so I usually go that route and get all drumsticks for my order.  The wings are always crispy, hot, fresh and decent sized too.    For $6.41, you get a filling lunch.  I will be back here every single Tuesday as long as they have half price wings.  Can't beat the price and the wings are really good!"}
{"text":"I usually roll to the Metro Center BWW, but their online ordering system was having some issues and when I called them, I was on hold for 5 minutes and decided to say screw it, hung up and then ordered online here.  I placed my order for me and a couple of coworkers and I placed the order to be picked up at 12:40.  I got in my car and drove up!   I got there right at 12:40, was greeted by multiple people, including a manager, paid for my food, and then waited.  And waited, and waited, and waited.  I did not get my food until 12:56pm.  What is the point of ordering your food for pickup at a specific time, if its not ready at that time?  It pisses me off, big time!  (I once wrote a complaint letter to another BWW about the same thing, and they told me that it takes longer to make the wings \"extra crispy\".  Makes sense, but if that's the case, when an order comes in at 11:30 to be picked up over an hour later, throw those damn wings in the fryer 5 minutes early.  Know what I mean?)  Anyways..........I got my food and made my way out to my car.  I got in my car, and noticed that they didn't give me any napkins.  WTF?  Strike two!  Another pet peeve of mine is when I receive no napkins.  Anyways......on to the food!  I went with a medium order of wings (15 wings) and split it in 2 flavors.  I went with Medium and Salt and Vinegar.  I ordered mine extra crispy, and all drumsticks.  Know what?  They were freaking fantastic!  Might have been the best BWW wings I have had to date.  They were extra crispy yet still moist on the inside.  Usually with extra crispy wings, you get some dried out chicken.  This chicken was perfect.  Whoever their wing cook was today, he did a damn fine job!  The medium wings were coated perfectly (not too much sauce) and the salt and vinegar dry rub wings were really awesome, too!  I mowed down my wings in about 10 minutes (due to having to wait to get my shit, but I already complained about that once in this review ;-) lol!) due to having to get back to work on time.  Overall, great wings, great customer service, but the horrible wait and no napkins was a major buzzkill.  Will I be back?  Probably.  They HAVE to figure out some way to have orders ready on time though, extra crispy or not.  That is all folks............."}
{"text":"Wing Tuesday ($.60 cents a wing) is a pretty good deal.  Decided to try out their online ordering and placed an order for 8 medium wings and 8 \"desert heat\" wings.  Chose my pickup time for 5:40 and was right on time.  I walked in, paid my money and got my wings.  Service was friendly.  I even got a survey on my receipt which gives me $5.00 off next time I come (within 2 weeks).  The wings were good. I forgot to specify \"extra crispy\" but they were still good.  $10.51 for 16 wings is a decent enough deal.  I liked the medium ones way better than the desert heat.  The desert heat wings had a dry rub on them and just weren't that good....a little dry.  The medium wings were tasty and just hot enough.  Ill be back to eat in and get some extra crispy wings on a Tuesday night in the near future."}
{"text":"I'll start this review by saying that this locations poor ratings do not surprise me. I am a server on the strip, and that is the only reason I DID NOT talk to a manager tonight. My boyfriend and i went in to grab dinner and a drink before a movie , and all around we received some of the worst service I have ever had. Marcus (busser/host) was extremely rude to us right off the bat. When I asked for a booth he spent ten minutes trying to talk us into sitting at the bar, and then he sat three black men, that came in after us- before us!! (Of course he was also black). In all fairness, Marcus' looked like he had he education of a second grader & his dreadlocks may have been preventing him from thinking clearly BC he  sat us in Courtney's section...She was bland & incompetent. Just like her host counterpart. It took her fifteen minutes to grab my beer from the bar & then she  dropped our check ten minutes into the meal. The staff here is a joke. Proof that there is work for everyone in Las Vegas.   P.S whoever the manager is of this location, should  pay more attention to his  employees grooming habits."}
{"text":"Great food and great service last week! Love their teriyaki wings, chicken wrap and their pulled pork sandwich! Yum!"}
{"text":"We have never visited a BWW, but our family swears by them. After this visit, we will swear AT them. We are not certain if this location is indicative of the chain, but if it is, this is certainly a place to be wary of. A bit of underhandedness going on with it's customers.  We arrived before 5 and the place was not at all busy - likely around 20% full. Our server was friendly, but seemed uninformed as to the menu. We had some questions about taste and style and the best she could come up with was \"well, it's very popular\". Sadly, this is not an answer to a question about taste - just because it is popular, doesn't mean it is good.   We had an email coupon for an app, so we ordered the onion rings. They came out and honestly were a bit overcooked and bland. Salt is cheap and you don't have to add a lot to awaken the flavors of a batter. We have had worse, but they are certainly not great by any stretch of the imagination.   While having these, I noticed water all over the table and traced it back to the water I had. The cup was cracked and leaking. After a few attempts to flag down our server (once, I even got a 'headnod' from her, but I guess she was busy and couldn't make it back for a while), she finally came over ans asked how we were doing. I let her know about the tumbler and off she went to get another one - and we were left with jaws open as we were also trying to inquire how much longer the wing order was going to take.  We opted for the dry wings with 4 sauces each. This was interesting as, after the almost 30 min wait (I know because I got to watch a whole period of hockey), they came out and only 4 of the 8 sauces were right. We had to have our server bring out the correct ones. Now, if you write down the sauce selections, wouldn't it make sense to check them off as they come out? After a bit, we got it all correct and settled. The wings, overall were ok... some of the sauces, not so much. The wife noticed two of hers were like salt licks. Interesting since the onion rings are so bland. Two of mine just weren't good. We just left them when we left the restaurant.  And did you know you have to ask for carrots and celery? Even though the menu says it is included, we had to ask for them after we got the wings and then waited a little more before we got some shriveled up orange things and brown ended green ones.  The final issue was when we got the bill. It seems that the place does not differentiate on their menu between regular beers and 'craft' beers. You will find BLue Moon listed right under Bud Light, but there are DOLLARS of difference between them. Neither the server nor manager could explain why there is NO notation on the menu or the servers don't say there is a difference. This seems to be a bit of a scam. We had the beer, so we had to pay for it, but if they had been honest, I would have ordered a different kind. SO, we now know they do this n purpose to get that extra dollar or two from customers.  Such a shame this location is failing so much in service and fall victim to the corporate directives to squeeze as much out of unsuspecting customers.   We'll try another location to see if it is specific to this one or BWW as a whole."}
{"text":"I live here. And B-Dubs is my fav go to, honestly Multiple times a week. The mango habenero is out of this world.  Bloody Mary is killer. I've never had a single issue and have been here a million times."}
{"text":"I love going to Buffalo Wild Wings, especially during football season. But going to a place where you feel unwelcome doesn't make you want to come back. We sat in the bar because it was a bit busy, and I understand busy I'm a restaurant manager, but not even a \"we will be with you in a minute\" was given after 15 minutes passed and no one greeted us. When our server did she wasn't friendly at all nor cracked a smile. I'm not sure if she didn't understand social cues or was just having a bad night but when the two people that are sitting at the table are wearing team shirts of the team playing on TV they probably want to stay and watch the game... she gave us our tab without even asking if we wanted anything else. Which we had wanted another beer. I feel like that's just common courtesy or maybe she was being cut for the night. Which I highly doubt because it was busy. Either way coming back to this location is highly unlikely for us. Service makes the visit."}
{"text":"My first time here was about a year ago and it was a god awful experience. However management made it up by giving me and my family dinner on them. The first time me and my family sat about 10 mins with no assistance, we asked for a manager who came over and apologized and said he would have someone out in less than 2 minutes. Well after 10 more minutes no one still showed up so we walked out. From what I could see there were some employees in the kitchen fighting. I haven't been back in a while until today. From the moment we walked in to the time we left everything was perfect. The hostesses was super friendly, she even tried to take our drink order so we didn't have to just sit and wait until our waitress arrived. Our waitress was nice and the manger even came by to check and see if everything was good. Food was good, service was speedy and friendly and price was as expected. Restaurant was also clean. What more can you ask for. Whatever you all changed you are on the right path keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the years. I have never left a review so I decided to do one now. I have no complaints, the food is always good, prices are as expected, they play pretty good music, the atmosphere is always pretty good I mean not complaints. Sarah the Bartender is always nice, friendly and efficient as well as Brian the Manager. Again, I have been several times and I am sure I will return for several more!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was not crowded, about 5 tables. And they made me wait 40 mins for my take away lunch. Ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"As any other BDubs, they are a great place to go to just about any sporting event on one of of their MANY screens.  If you don't see it on, just ask and they will find a screen within view for you.  Chicken wings, chicken wings, and chicken wings...We all had wings and they were great. The staff is patient and pleasant with your numerous questions about spice levels and different dry rubs. All in all if you're in to good wings and a variety of good beers in a sports-bar atmosphere you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"As much as I love going to BWW, I am no longer a fan of  ordering take out!! I usually order ranch sauce with my fries and the waitress did not \"go over\" my order to make sure I got everything I paid for (since it's their policy). They did not put ranch sauce in my bag and I only realized it wasn't there when I came home. Btw they DO charge for ranch sauce.  Another time, I ordered 6 bourbon honey mustard wings and I only got 5 wings instead of 6. I know these complaints may seem minor but the second time around did not make me change my mind about their customer service!!! Also some of the staff at the front were not familiar with the lunch club punch cards. (Since I wanted a punch card, I had to explain what it is). I am absolutely disappointed with this location and it's even near my house too!!!!!"}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles I never expected people in Vegas to be so kind and generous Christina and Mike have the most amazing customer service their hospitality is beyond it ! Making sure me and my friends had everything we needed . Kept checking on us every chance they got . I recommend this Buffalo Wild Wings when you're out here ! Make sure Christina and Mile Take Care of You Guys ! 1000 Stars for them !!!"}
{"text":"From Cali to Arizona Jeremy treated us like family . I will sure be visiting bww when I come out here . So worth it . Thanks Jeremy"}
{"text":"Were it not for the people I was in the company of last night, I would have had an awful night at BWW. They cancelled trivia (which is why we went in the first place) because of the basketball game on the air craft carrier.  I get it, it's Veteran's Day, but it's not that like thats news - couldn't you have cancelled in advance?  I would have come another time.  There was an entire section of the restaurant that was closed, and yet you cancel? Annoying. We sat in the bar because trivia is held there (starting at 8) and the service left much to be desired.  Especially when I am eating Mango Habanero wings (holy mama! Tasty but super sneaky hot), I NEED my iced tea glass to stay full.  My Strawberry cream cheese pie was okay, but I wouldn't order it again as it was small and seemed to have a little frostbite.  The Spinach flatbread and consistent wing sauce wonderfulness kept this from being a 1 for me."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place and I've gotten carryout. The carryout service can be a bit slow late on weekends. My only complaint, however, is that sometimes they don't put enough barbecue sauce on the wings -it's like they are careless about dipping the wings in the sauce and half the wings may have nothing on them.  I've taken to asking them for extra sauce on the side (even though it's always lukewarm), but sometimes they'll screw up the order and give me sauce on the side but none on the wings!  Egads.  I eat a mostly vegetarian diet these days but if I wanted wings, I'd still come back here. I'd just check the order before leaving! ;-)   OH- I should add that they have a TV-based series of trivia games that patrons can play from their tables using these electronic units.  Some people are pretty addicted to these games; there are different ones on different days of the week, and all of the BWW restaurants across the country are ranked live on the screen.  It's kinda fun, if you like that."}
{"text":"Seemed to be a clean and popular place. Kind of out of the way, I thought, but not too inconvenient a location.  I ordered to go and found the food quality to be no different from other BW3s I've been to.  Buffalo wings are the last meat I'll give up, and they do a good job with them. I tried their soft pretzels as well and found them to be quite good and filling.   I like that it's 24 hours and has free wi-fi."}
{"text":"This place sucks for takeout.  This is the second time I have gotten to the restaurant and waited 30 min after calling the order in.  Never again."}
{"text":"The only reason they're getting 2 stars is because the chicken was alright. From the moment we walked in to the cramped, tiny entrance we were made to wait. No hostess in sight. When we got someone to talk to use we were told \"sit at the bar, it'll be a while before a waitress can come and take your drink order\" uh okay. It's almost comical so we decided to stay and see if they were just bustin our chops. Well the waitress came in a timely manner which changed the sour taste I had for this specific establishment, but then we ordered food...big mistake. I felt like we were burdens to our waitress, she didn't even bother writing down our order which of course meant we got served wrong type of sides. Fine, but to see her chatting it up with male patrons made me upset especially since we waited over 22 minutes (clock at the bar told me) for our Luke warm food really pissed me off. She seemed upset when we asked for our correct order but then again it could've just been her face since I didn't see her crack a smile whatsoever with us. They weren't even busy so that couldn't have been an excuse for the bad service, I just know I won't come to this BWW again. 2 positives: good music (country, yay) and the managers seem really involved(we must've just lucked out)."}
{"text":"Been here at least a dozen times.  Gets a little chaotic at times but pretty standard bdubs.  We went for the draft a couple days ago and service was terrible.  45 mins to get beer and the wings came out over an hour after we ordered and they were cold.  Very disappointing ... Went across street to hooters and finished night.  Likes bdubs food way better but can't deal with that bad of service."}
{"text":"Now I see why the ratings for this Buffalo Wild Wings is so low... I just left this location and the food was ok, but we had a new waitress, Ally.  When we received the bill, she was presented with my credit card and when she returned with the receipt for us to sign, she'd swiped my card for another table's bill (which was literally 2x the amount of our bill... PAY ATTENTION ALLY).  So they voided the charge and I still had to pay for my original bill. Now what if I didn't have that much money in my account?  They need to train their employees better and the manager acted as of she was lost as hell... DO BETTER BDUBs... I won't be returning (unless my money isn't back in my account within the next couple of days)"}
{"text":"I never really come here for the food because its mediocre at best besides the wings. My favorite is the mango habanero! :) I always do come for the 65 tv's & all the big games. However my husband & I always get excellent service from Amrakey."}
{"text":"Food poisoning, again.  We just ordered wings and a salad from there 2 nights ago.  This was the 2nd time in 6 months that one of us has gotten sick from the food.  There are plenty of restaurants that offer wings, Fathead's being one of them.  We will no longer pay the high prices for low quality food at BW-3."}
{"text":"Good service, good beer, great wings!!! BW's is a great spot. Be a little bad. Have fun and good beer. Definitely a kick back n chill time."}
{"text":"Kyle was an amazing server, very friendly. We had teriyaki which was amazing and garlic Parmesan which was a bit creamy and on the spicy side. I loved the Mac and cheese, the pasta was big, and I loved the size of the wings much bigger than stuff you find at grocery store. They have Pepsi products here not coke. So I do recommend them!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times with my friend. He always does the Blazing challenge (12 wings 6 minutes) but that is just too spicy for me. The first time we got our wings really quick but last night service was super slow... we got there at like 6:20 and didn't leave until like 8. I got the teriyaki wings. They have really good sauce and are pretty good size. Usually they are really expensive at about $1 per wing, but they are 60 cents on Tuesdays (hence why we only go Tuesdays)"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're looking to watch the UFC fights. I started visiting BWW when I lived in the Midwest, I'd go there to watch every UFC fight because they are one of the few places there (or here) that show the fights free.  My boyfriend and I went to this location a few weekends ago. We went to see the Rhonda Rousey fight on UFC. We knew we needed to get there early to get a seat so we showed up over an hour before the pay-per view started. There was a huge wait in the restaurant and I was told I could just go right back to the bar. Well, with the local UNLV basketball game on there wasn't an empty seat in the place. We spoke to a waitress who took our order and opened a tab for us, she told us she knew a few of her tables were not staying for the UFC fights so she'd make sure we got a seat. Well  in short that never happened. A table of hers did open up but when we tried to move there we were told that the manager said we couldn't, he was giving it to a couple who was 'on the list up front'. I was pretty upset because we'd been waiting nearly an hour at this point, the fights had started and when I'd gone up front they told me I didn't need to be on a list. The waitress told us that the manager promised he'd find us seats because she'd told him we'd been waiting. Well, needless to say it never happened.  After standing in a crowded bar for well over an hour one spot opened up at the bar so I was finally able to stand and my boyfriend had to continue standing behind me. Not exactly our idea of enjoying the fight. We were finally able to order food once I sat down, but we had to cash out our tab with the first waitress so she could move our tab to the bar. It was a hassle to have to pay and tip twice.  Sure it's nice to have no cover to watch the fights. But I'd rather pay a cover and be able to have a seat. Needless to say, we won't be coming here to watch the fights anymore."}
{"text":"Amazing wings. Love the teriyaki bettter than I did the ones at Wing Stop. Those and the Asian Zing ones that I ordered barely lasted a minute before they were all devoured. Tried the Mango Habenero sauce which was good and really hot but decided to get the other two. Friend had honey bbq and was amazing as well. Only downside is the wings are really small. Went on Thursday for the 60 cent boneless wings, otherwise it wouldn't have been worth it. Hence the loss of a star."}
{"text":"Visited during NFL playoff game and of course it was packed with a wait, but with big screen tvs in the waiting area we didn't mind the wait and didn't miss any of the game. It's hard to critic service when the place is so packed, you have to expect some drop in service but our service didn't drop into unacceptable territory. Our server was friendly and though was delayed at times did a pretty good job of attending to us. The food came out at the expected time and was prepared well. Everyone enjoyed their meal, what you see is what you get. Overall I was impressed with our experience and how the crowds were managed, definitely would return here to watch a big sporting event without fear of being miserable. I'll update after a more normal visit."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times. The food is good and typical bar food. The atmosphere is fun. I've never once had good service here though. From being left standing at the door, waiting 5-10 min once we got seated, messed up food orders,etc. The servers that we've had have always been I knowledgeable about the menu and lazy/uncaring about taking care of their customers."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the food but Olivia our server was a great part to stopping in and having a late night dinner.   Place needs a damn vacuum because the floor looked like it wasn't vacuumed since Thursday and I was there on a Saturday night.  Hosts were young and not really into working. Ordered a Arnold Palmer and the young lady said \"oh I can't get you that alcoholic drink\" wow, it's half lemonade & half ice tea sweetheart...   Not sure what they teach these people.   The kitchen took long but hey that's expected I guess when it was dead earlier and the manager sent people home and then it got busy, at least that is what I heard from a few people.  Thanks Olivia for serving us, you did a great job."}
{"text":"Called in our order to pick up and take it back to our room.  Food was great but they need to foil paper the wings to keep their heat.   By the time we got to our hotel the wings were simply warm and not hot. Our drive was 10 minutes on the freeway.  Anyhow, great location, hope to return since there is a improv comedy club a few doors down."}
{"text":"Decent Wild Wings location. MUCH better for sports and wings than the nearby Quaker Steak and Lube, which went way down hill in the last 5-8 years.. Plenty of screens, never over crowded, every NFL game on, UFC fights without cover... Service is good in the bar, which is where  I recommend you sit - unless you are lugging around a large group or family... Overall - the best place in the \"far south hills\" of Pittsburgh for sports, food, and drinks... and one of the better Wild Wings franchise locations that I have been to..."}
{"text":"It's 1pm at least 10 open tables. Yet, we were told 45min wait. We get seated n our waitress is no where to be found. We search for the manager, we get a waitress 5min later. She makes it known she's a bartender not a waitress. \"Im here because my manager said you haven't been helped\" did not seem excited to help us. Let us know her bar was probably pissed at her. Overall service was horrible!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Your normal wings. My only complaint was that we tried to enjoy a nice night our side and the patio was pretty dirty. Somebody should go out on a regular schedule and sweep."}
{"text":"I really used to be a fan of BWW and their quality of food. Service always was questionable but the food made it worth going back. Well, this one just so happened to be the closest one to me and I stopped in. Ordered naked tenders and a salad while my friend ordered naked tenders and chips. After waiting for what seemed to be forever we finally received our food. Tenders were cold and my salad was wilted and obviously old. We brought it to the attention of the server and asked to have one of the tenders orders warmed up since my appetite was gone from the disgust of the salad. To add more frustration to the entire experience we were charged for the salad! I'm not looking for a free meal, never have but when you see i haven't touched my food and showed the server my salad the right thing to do would be not charge for the $2 salad instead I walked out paying over $40. I'm disgusted and frustrated with the entire ordeal. Would rather go to PT's next time I'm craving wings"}
{"text":"It's always 50/50 here you never know what service you'll get. Sometimes it's great sometimes it's crappy. It's the same we the food. Came here on Sunday had wings with fries and you could tell they were freshly made very warm and had good taste. Came back on Wednesday and the wings tasted like they were reheated ordered fries but didn't get those.   The servers also vary lol some will come back to make sure everything is fine. Other servers will take your order drop it off and you won't see them until you wave them over so you can get your bill.   But all that won't stop me from coming back. For a decent price you can get full. Usually I'll go for the small (10 pieces) boneless wings fries and 2 lemonades for around 20 bucks. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Very depressing ambience and unfriendly and ignorant waitress-- never try this location."}
{"text":"Horrible and very slow service and they messed up my order. They were not crowed either. Ordered a Cobb Salad and server brought me the wrong salad then tried to ask like it was right- left off bacon, cranberries, and walnuts. Had shredded cheese on it which it doesn't come with. Wrong dressing on the side! Server wanted to bring me bacon, walnuts, and cranberries to add to my own salad. Why not bring me the lettuce too. Why not have me go in the kitchen and make my own! Will not be back to this one again!"}
{"text":"Turned on the sox game for me, plan to be here for hockey season. Waitress was very friendly staff was cool chatted about Boston ( always a plus and 1 half). The food was decent, I am picky but it met my standards. 5 stars for good people good service."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the Happy Hour at this Centennial location on 6-7-16. When I pulled up in the parking lot it was nearly full and I thought, uh-oh, the bar is gonna be totally full. Thankfully it wasn't.   Atmosphere: the usual for a sports bar. Multiple large screen tvs showing various sporting events. On the loud side, but whadda ya expect? Overall clean.  Staff: bartenders were attentive, helpful, friendly and ensured we were taken care of. One simple and effective way I judge service, is how long it takes to get an empty water glass refilled. Here, it wasn't long.   Food: Had their Tuesday special traditional wings (70 cents/each) with Garlic Parmesan dipping sauce. The wings were nicely crispy golden brown and moist and tender in the middle. Yum.   Then had the Chili Queso Dip with tortilla chips. This was topped with a spoonful of pico de gallo. The chili was miniscule, didn't even realize it had chili until I looked up the official name from my posted pic. Anyways, it was alright.   Lastly, ordered the Southwest Loaded Chips. Crispy and tasty dressed with liquid cheese and southwest ranch. Would order again  Drinks: Tall, cold, Bud Lights. Perfect when it's 110 out.   Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Super fun time at this location on Harmon. Adorable and super friendly bartender Chris added to a comfortable and enjoyable spin to a laid back environment. There were some major issues with the new Playmaker system, but the helpful employees (Kevin) remedied the problem. If you like friendly servers, great beer and wing deals, check out this location."}
{"text":"BWW needs a hostess at all times. We were standing at the restaurant waiting to be seated for a good ten minutes because no one showed up at the front. Other than that, the service was decent. Our server separated the mild sauce from the plain wings that my friend ordered because he didn't like wings to be drenched in sauce. I find that really considerate. We had a manager coming in to see how we are and the food was amazing. I'd come back when it's busy and there's at least someone at the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat!! great wings, great bartender, and wonderful waitresses. Go out of their way to put on the games you want, respectful and always aware if my glasses getting empty. Bartender is absolutely the best. Always has my food ready fast and always makes sure I'm happy with my drink. Def best place for wings and a good time with friends and family"}
{"text":"Best wings ever! Love how they treat customers. Always great service expecially from the bartender. Never keeps us waiting and always on top of things. Waitresses are amazing and go out of their way just to put on the game you wanna see. Def highly recommend and if you go on the discounted wing days shoot your really getting a good deal!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.... Order boneless wings and this is what it looked it... No sauce at all. Dry wigs. My food was cold. I understand I ordered food to pick up, but I told you guys the time I would be coming. Not coming back."}
{"text":"The food was great!   The service was fast and friendly.  We sat in the outside seating area which was a mistake. They allow smoking in that area which is a problem if you are a non-smoker trying to enjoy your meal.  Pets are also welcomed in the outdoor seating area, which is fantastic!  There are large TVs and good quality sound for the outside seating area which adds to the experience in a positive way.  The NASCAR Hall of Fame is visible from the dining area and is only about 100 feet away."}
{"text":"pFirst time visit. Pleasant surprise. Parties of people enjoying each other's company. Noise was solid but not shouting. Decibel 40? Ordered sampler and wild hot. Garlic mushrooms, soft pretzels, 4 wings and pita chips with artichoke dip. Girlfriend enjoyed therefore I enjoyed. Taxes and tip $18."}
{"text":"What a down slide this place has taken! Use to be a great place to go. Now the beer taste like they never clean the lines food is so so. Only good thing I'll say is they do have good sauces for the wings. Other then that went downhill fast. Even the shirts they wear now look crappy and dirty! Prices seem to have gone up and with decline of everything else how do you justify?"}
{"text":"Yea I being to many BWW.....this one was average good. The wings are always a good choice. I kind of hate how they did the menu (no more flat bread?). Good drink menu but can be better. I just feel the set up as so close together....need more space. Anyways there are other bars to watch sports on."}
{"text":"Three stars on the food, 5 on the service. The cook went an extra step to make my husband a burger that they used to make a few months ago, thank you! But still the food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"The service is always pretty good at this BWW.  I generally meet my buddies from high school here when we are all back in town.  I personally perfer a lot of the local bar wings to the chain wings.  Also drafts can be pricey here so watch what you are ordering or your bill could be jacked at the end of the night.  Good spot to watch sports."}
{"text":"BWWs never fails to dissapoint.  I have found the staff at this location is very personalable and on top of it.  Luv the variety of spices for wings."}
{"text":"I don't normally thrive on these types of restaurants, but tonight was cool. I took a party there. The atmosphere was loud, but that was cool. BWW is know for that environment. Our server was Kelsey and she was training Andrew.   I came in knowing that there was a fight later and it would be a packed house. I only wish the manager would have told me in advance that we had to be out by 7:30. We were told that after we sat down because of a fight reservation they had. I would have scheduled the dinner for 5:00 pm instead.   The food was good. Kelsey and Andrew were great."}
{"text":"Two hour wait for to go orders. Ok if you let us know so we can wait at home instead of standing in an entry way packed like sardines with 25 other annoyed folks. Second time. There will not be another. Young man at the front also lied and tried to tell me it had only been an hour. Only problem was I had a text advising when the order had been placed. The other thing that is annoying is they take your payment right when you get there so you're kind of stuck. Sad because we like the food but cannot tolerate the poor service. Never again."}
{"text":"Food was good when it came out. I had some issues with the staff but the manager took care of the issue at hand. I would probably go back based on the manager ability to handle the situation properly."}
{"text":"Been a fan of this place since I hit one up in Anaheim a few years back. Food is always solid. Sometimes the staff is a little TOO perky. But whatever."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. Really boils down to who your sever is.  Their wings are bomb but frys always suck. I prefer hot and fresh not ones sitting under a heat lamp.  They give military discount which is a super plus!"}
{"text":"I admit that I only usually come here on Tuesdays cuz that's when they have their special on wings. I LOVE eating wings and I totally fell in LOVE with the SALT & VINEGAR flavor...oh man! That is what I'm talking about!!!  This place can get crowded and service is not as great due to crowds, but it's alright."}
{"text":"The wings are good, but the ultimate nachos are sadly lacking. It's coated with lettuce and Cheez Whiz. During our last visit, the place was swarming with flies. It grossed my kids out and they don't want to go back."}
{"text":"We went here one night when they had the 50 cent wing specials.  They had tons of families and large parties with lots of discarded paper containers everywhere, that hadn't been cleared by a waitress.  It was actually quite gross that they would leave everything on the table, it made the whole restaurant look like a trash dump.  The wings are ok, with my favorite being the teriyaki with the caramelized sauce on the outside, and the mild.  I normally like them spicy but the spicy ones here were a little too crazy for me, as I just like traditional buffalo flavor.  Because this day was a special on the buffalo wings, if you wanted celery and dressing to go with your wings they charged you a few dollars for just a few stalks of celery.  It was quite a rip off and stupid.  I think it comes out to a dollar a piece of celery.  I also didn't like that the beer (have to have beer with wings after all) was so overpriced.  It was good, but with so many places in town charging half the price for beer, there's no point in going here.  My husband alone won't go back here because of this."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Buffalo Wild Wings, and since this location was under a year old, I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone and give it a shot.  We (a group of 5: 3 adults and 2 kids) arrived at just after 7pm.  The restaurant was busy, but definitely not full, as we were seated right away and there were several other tables empty in our section.  Our server took our drink order and then answered a few questions about the kids menu. My sister ordered wings - oriental something and curry something, while her husband had a buffalo chicken sandwich.  I had a grilled chicken salad with their own ranch dressing, and the kids had corn dog bites.  The Good:  My salad was good.  Can't really complain about that.  The chicken sandwich was good as well.  The Not-So-Good:  The wings were REALLY spicy.  My brother in law basically has hot sauce in his veins and HE said it was overly spicy!  Also, a side of celery and carrots came out with the wings...3 sticks of carrots and 2 of celery.  The celery was very pale and one honestly looked like a filet of a bigger piece.  I would struggle to call it an actual celery stick.  The BAD:  Service.  Like I said, the restaurant was NOT full.  It was busy, but not full.  Our order took OVER 40 minutes to get to our table.  I played 3 full games of Texas Holdem on their little computer table thing to kill time and the food still was not there.  Even worse, we were never given any updates.  Our waitress pretty much just left us alone.  My sister finally asked ANOTHER waitress to get our waitress so we could see when we were finally going to eat.  The waitress never came, but the one she asked gave us an update and the food arrived about 5 minutes later. Second, our waitress, was not what I would call a \"in a good mood\" girl that night, and it showed.  While polite, she just did not have a friendly demeanor.  She did her job, but that's what it seemed like she was doing.  It was very impersonal, and the fact she didn't bother to notice we sat there for 40 minutes with no food and never offered any kind of explanation (the kitchen is backed up, or offered to check on what's the hold up), I really cannot give the service a good review.  For a dinner that should have been done within 45 minutes total, it took WAY too long on a night that was not extremely busy by restaurant standards.  I am honestly in no rush to go back to Buffalo Wild Wings any time soon."}
{"text":"If I could I'd give this place zero stars. The customer service was horrible! The waiter spilled a full cup of water on someone at our table and gave a $1 discount for it. We asked to speak to the manager and the \"kitchen manager\" Danny came out and was extremely rude. He wouldn't listen to our concerns, argued profusely and offered a 20% discount. He continuously explained that it was only water not any other type of beverage, which shouldn't have even mattered. I understand accidents happen but the customer service was horrible. Especially from \"management\""}
{"text":"Three stars because the food was good. The waitress was horrible. The service sucked. The only nice person was Troy the guest services guy. I had to keep asking other servers for drinks and for the box and bill.  there's plenty of better ones around."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed that they don't give ranch with wings any more.  They wanted to charge 60 cents per container...not sure if this is a new or temporary policy... Either way, it sucks"}
{"text":"Soooo went here last night.. Waiter was amazing in the dinning area. Wait staff 5 stars forsure. Food not so happening. If you get a order of wings your good. But the tailgater sampler is horrible. Your like omg yes pretzels and cheese wahoo! Then you get queso all good but don't serve salsa in you cheese for pretzels. Ewww freaking eww. I ended up using the spinach artichoke dip for the pita chips instead. That's because the pita chips would have cut my mouth open. Pita is suppose to be softer. This was like trying to chew threw a burnt pie crust. The pretzels alone were amazing. Spinach artichoke dip amazing. The wings in the sampler were tough, cold, and had no freaking sauce. Fail all in all cus it cost too much for inedible food."}
{"text":"This is one of the busier BWW.  Located right next to the outlet malls, lots of traffic and tourists.  Plenty of tv's around so you can always catch your favorite sports team play.  I normally order lemon pepper and chipotle BBQ traditional wings, both dry rubs and I always ask for it extra crispy.  Add beer and you're good !!"}
{"text":"I grew up on wings... back in the day, my friends and I would eat at Native New Yorker 2-3 times per week; wings were 10 cents a piece - it was cheaper to eat at Native than McDonalds! Native is and always has been my barometer for wings. I'm not saying that's right or that's wrong, but that's what I got. I've never been to Buffalo so I can't measure anyone's wings to the \"original\".  Wings are - and always have been - a meal, not an appetizer. That's how we ate em in high school, that's how I still eat them. A plate of 10, MAYBE a dozen if I'm super duper hungry and the accompanying celery and carrots. My husband on the other hand views wings as strictly a starter.  At any rate, desiring a protein fix, we headed off in the Ferrari of Minivans to the local Buffalo Wild Wings in an attempt to \"try something new\". Granted, I'm not big on chain restaurants for \"trying something new\" - I'd much rather go someplace locally owned. But I digress.  We went to this location on campus and I was quickly shocked at how \"barry\" the place was... I was expecting more of a restaurant than a bar. Oh well, there were other kids there, but - being Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, there was an abundance of raucous, young (and dare I say, handsome) men watching the game on a variety of TVs and mawing down wings.   Alas, they had a kids menu, so that settled it - we were NOT the first people to bring a kid to BWW!  Our waitress was very helpful, fast on her feet - all around a great waitress. She deserves top marks! Then the \"Team Captain\" came by and really introduced us to the wide world of wings. Back in the day, all you had was HOT, MEDIUM or MILD... now, there is a veritable cornucopia of sauces and styles, ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous. Our Team Captain had us try them all (with fries)  Want an Asian flare? They got it. Curry on your mind? They got it. Feelin jerk-y? Try the Caribbean.  Don't want sauce, but a dry rub? They got it. Wings are their own \"cuisine\" now, and not just some easy, cheap thing to throw together (and the prices match... what used to cost me a buck has decupled (increased tenfold...)  Bottom line, the people we encountered at BWW did a great job of representing their brand and their service alone will probably draw me back.  Let's move on to the food. I deign to say I'm a wing \"purist\", but maybe I am... I found their sauces, while creative and plentiful, not very palatable. They had this mass-produced, non-fresh, full of corn syrup and additives and preservatives taste and feel. There was this \"creaminess\" to the sauces that was just... not appealing. The wings themselves were huge - meaty, very ample sized wings... in fact, I could barely finish five and I'm used to eating 10 or 12. They were cooked perfectly, not a bad one in the bunch. The ranch dressing, like the wing sauce, had a mass-produced, non-fresh flavor and feel to it.   Bottom line - great place to watch a game in a clean, open, environment and the staff is great. Food? Hmm.. just not there for me."}
{"text":"We are regulars in this particular restaurant and have always had excellent service.  Today is the first time we had HORRIBLE service and had to ask for a manager.  The server, Brooke, was absolutely rude and had a huge attitude.  The new Fast Break lunch timer wasn't started when our order was taken... and considering we ordered our main course with our drinks, we expected the timer to be started... instead, the timer didn't start until our appetizer came out.  Looked like she changed the rules to make sure we didn't get free food.  Manager John did give a small discount, but compared to a full order being free, it was a drop in the bucket.  We may have to consider going to a new wing place if we continue to get sub par service with attitude."}
{"text":"This is a great BWW, somewhat off the strip but still plenty busy! Wings are good, drinks are good, service is good, nothing to complain about!"}
{"text":"I think their drinks can be a bit pricey if it's not on happy hour (happy hour til 7pm m-f)  servers/wait staff is sometimes really amazing and other times mediocre; never had bad service though. Food is average. Fun environment, my husband and I come to play trivia. Would recommend mostly for the generally good service and fun environment. Can be \"loud\"; that sometimes bothers the older crowd so just FYI."}
{"text":"Awesome and fun place to eat! We used to come all the time but our fave server (Sara) no longer works there!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is one of my all time fave places to eat. It's really chill and casual and the prices are good. The sauces are amazing and they have quite a variety of different kinds of appetizers. I really love the new rewards program they have as well and how you earn points to purchase at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Came in to watch a soccer match. Thy changed a big screen for us which was great, kept the drinks filled and attended to all needs. My only suggestion would be don't pile everyone so close to each other when the place isn't close to being full. We had an annoying kids kicking the booth behind us which was the same structure I was sitting in. It made me nauseated and the parents were too busy stuffing their faces.. not BWW fault but again space everyone out"}
{"text":"How can I miss $ .45 per wing with bone at BWW on Tuesday night??  So I ordered bunch of wings with all different tasty sauces as usual.. (Of course , I had one of my favorite beer, \"Blue Moon\" with slice of orange in a tall glass!) Well, this is what I found,, one of the sauces called, \"Asian Zing\" which  is very close to the one I used to have & enjoy the most at Korean Fried Chicken(Yangyeom Dak) places in L.A.  The Hot chili pepper, soy sauce, ginger, & sweetness were all well blended  together... Yumm!! Hmm, I'm thinking I might go back on Thursday night to try the boneless chicken fingers wth Asian Zing sauce.. I am ready for  burning/numbness on my lips of hot chili pepper once again~!!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here before heading to the outlets next door.  The place was busy so we got a bar table.  Our waiter/bartender come over quickly and brought menus and took drink orders. Even though he was one of the bartenders and was busy, he came over and checked on us frequently.  I had the boneless wings with teriyaki sauce.  My mom had the regular wings with teriyaki sauce.  We both liked our wings and we had leftovers to take home.  We also had a basket of fries which was just huge.  Fries were crisp on the outside, soft inside.  I love that the wings come with celery, carrots and either ranch or blue cheese dressing.  I would say I prefer the blue cheese dressing.    This place definitely has good food when you want something like bar food.  Good service, good location next to the outlets.  Lots of people there watching a soccer game so you can do that too."}
{"text":"We usually go to this BWW every Tuesday to get the bogo offer, but this last few weeks we have been disappointed in the quality of the wings because they would be dry and they usually don't have enough sauce, but they have also messed up our orders multiple times, today they gave us 30 wings instead of 36, also some of the wings were really small or chopped in half. I think we will never go to this BWW ever again."}
{"text":"I've had take-away orders of wings from this location before, and they've never really had anything stand out about them, so they get my average rating.  This last time though, everything was SO dry. We prefer the flavors that are just seasoning, so there was no sauce to hide just how crunchy these wings were. It was my parents' first time trying the wings from here after my talking them up for a while and it was a bad first impression. Way to make me a liar."}
{"text":"My husband and I get takeout from here occasionally, but a few days ago was my first time actually eating there.  The general atmosphere was pretty much what you'd expect. Lots of tv's with lots of games on, and lots of people, so it was pretty noisy. That's not unexpected and not a complaint.  We were seated quickly, and our orders taken quickly as well. We started with onion rings and we both enjoyed them. My husband ordered Asian Zing and Parmesan Garlic, and I ordered Lemon Pepper and Chipotle BBQ. All if it was bone-in.  My husband enjoyed his wings, and I completely loved mine. Delicious!   I also got a drink - the Sour Irishman.  It was basically a slightly sour soda. I neither tasted nor felt any alcohol in it. I would have ordered it again just for the taste had it not had the alcohol's price tag.  We ended with cheesecake bites, which were decent but not really noteworthy. The place is known for wings, and the wings did NOT disappoint!  My only complaint is that our server seemed extremely unhappy to be serving. Maybe someone mentioned it, because in the last few minutes we noticed she forced a smile and attempted to be likeable. Another woman who came by mid-meal called herself our \"captain\" and was the total opposite. Immediately friendly, and smiling.  But the service doesn't bump my review down because my food was just so darn good!"}
{"text":"I normally don't like hot wings...so why go here huh??  ya, it was a crowd decision, but I enjoyed.  We were able to watch the new champion crowned for the females 115 lbs UFC...which was great.  The bartenders was a huge guy, but very friendly...all good there.  The food was a little late as others ordered behind us and received there food.  But the bartender took care of us...all good.  Mild wings for me...cool.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Worst bww ever horrible service and manage didn't even really show any concern. Took off my wedges.. Thanks. Host was mad I wanted a booth.... Server told me they only cook chicken for 12 minutes you get what you get basically!!!! Smh. Thank you bww will never be back at this location ever... Never ever had a problem I love bww. And I hate to complain. But it's wings top tonight for me......."}
{"text":"I use to frequent BWW often as it was a great place for a quick bite to eat with good food.  The service was wonderful and the servers always remember our names. Even our orders (that's when you know you eat there to much).  Whenever you had a bad experience the customer service would be ten folds and cover it up.   Months pass since we had been there and they hired new employees. They are great but lacking customer service skills. They seem to not care about their jobs or the customers coming in. You can order something simple and they would mess it up or forget to even put the order in.  We just assumed it was someone new learning the job and kept coming back to find out that it was a continuation of the same problems.   So we stopped coming to this location and have found a great server at the Sunset location.  We will drive out of our way to go to this location.    A couple nights ago we were too tired to drive the extra 15 mins and decided to stop in and try this location again. Come to find out it was the same. We were seated in Jackie's section. She was sweet at first with her greeting but forgot to put our appetizers. We waited 45 minutes for her to even come back around. To tell us that she didn't do it but if we want it now she can put it in, but it will be a wait.. In the back of my mind, I'm thinking there should be a minimal wait as you have half your staff eating in the corner booth by the door. And no servers walking around greeting the customers.  You even have the manager (an older gentleman) standing in one area watching football. We did not see Jackie until she provided us our bill and than disappear again.   I'm sorry, but I use to love this place as a fun bar with good food to go too. But everyone here needs a reality check on what customer service is. We didn't even get a sorry from Jackie about our order."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for the weekend and for general desire of an acceptable place to drink and bs with the friends, this is where we went.   It was all the flavors of beer and wings that I'd come to expect from BWW, yet so so far from home. It was remarkably soothing to chill here to escape the expected drunken bonanza from a typical Vegas trip."}
{"text":"The hubbs likes coming for their 15 minute lunch. We have stopped here a few times and bellied up at the bar. My go to is the buffalo boneless wings with spicy garlic sauce on the side. My hubby does the same but always tries different flavors. I do not mind the food, but it does not wow me.  We will come back since its a quick lunch but do not expect nothing fancy."}
{"text":"I go to BWW a lot first time at this location. This location has to be the worst service I ever received. First off we had to wait 10 mins to be greeted. The food came out separately. One came out quick the other 15 min later! SMH"}
{"text":"I love buffalo wild wings and all but the service at this location is not good!! I had a server she was a blonde too bad I didn't get her name. I went here after work with my bf around 10 pm. I ordered mild traditional wings, nachos, and spinach chicken artichoke flatbread. I asked the server for extra ranch and she forgot when she gave me my wings to my table. I told my bf to ask her again maybe she didn't hear me.. She didn't even acknowledge us and she was taking care of other customers. So it was time to pay then I asked her one last time may I have 2 extra ranch. She rolled her eyes and said ughhh ok now I have to go back and get it. Wow!!! She was so rude I wanted to curse her out but I didn't I told her just forget it and I left. Is it right for their employees to treat their customers like this???? I will never go back to this location. They have bad customer service and I was nice enough to even tip. People like her should not have a job especially dealing with customers because obviously they dont know how to treat people with respect. I suggest she should find another job because she's ruining this restaurants business with her negative attitude."}
{"text":"Went in here on a Saturday night and I completely understand it was busy! But when a restaurant says that they can't seat people because their kitchen is backed up that's a problem! The kitchen was backed up and there was a ton of open tables in the restaurant.... get your kitchen staff together if it's that big of an issue then maybe you should fire people and get a new kitchen staff that knows how to keep up with the pace of the restaurant on a Saturday night. Well not be coming back at least not by choice!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.. Had one bad experience,  but out of  the 2 days a week I come since last June.  The staff is great. Tom and Regina are great"}
{"text":"Great service! Lunch time meals are cheap and they come out quickly! Perfect service perfect sports bar vibes!"}
{"text":"Fist visit here ! From Cali ! Prompt service ! Like to be notice fast !! Great seating !"}
{"text":"Food is just like any other BWW- pricey but good for snacking. Not much on the menu that's healthy. I like to play NTN trivia, but the controllers here are always broken."}
{"text":"The trick to this place is to go to the bar area and get a booth in the back. Preferably on Thursdays when the boneless wings are on special!!! I've never been disappointed by this location"}
{"text":"Started to like buffalo wild wings but HATE this location.  Hualapai/Flamingo location was way more friendly and professional.  I understand Durango/Warm Springs is a busy location but the girl in the front who answers the phone and is the first person you see when you walk in is very rude and is the reason I will NEVER go back! Been craving wings and decided to just get in n out.  Told I wasn't able to order traditional wings snack,small, medium sizes, only their promo.  Couldn't even get her name cuz she talks so fast I couldn't catch it.  And this situation has happened more then once when calling in to do a pick up order.  Maybe only go if you decide to dine inside.  But don't waste your time trying to do a to go order. Tried a time to call in a order and was missing my celery/carrots I had paid extra for.   Try wingstop or timbers wings and customer service."}
{"text":"Just like most other bww locations which is a good thing. Lots of sports and awesome wings/ beer."}
{"text":"We stopped by BW3 (Ohio baby!) during our most recent trip to the mall for lunch and I was very impressed.  We were allowed to pick our own table, greeted, and asked if there was a particular game we came to watch and offered to change channels if there was something we did want to watch that wasn't already on. Nice touch.  We were also offered a sample of their new triple cheesy appetizer thing (cheese curds, motz sticks, and grilled cheese sandwich dusted with their \"Desert Heat\" spice) which was another nice touch.  The grilled cheese with the Desert Heat spice was very surprising.   I don't do bones or cartilage so I opted for the Boneless Wings snack size and they were not snack sized.  The snack size was 8 boneless wings in all their saucy glory and was a lot to eat.  The Boy, on the other hand, eats everything on the wing/drummy except the bone so he went with 15 wings (can't remember the size) with 3 different sauces.  Wings come with your choice of blue cheese or Ranch and carrots or celery.   The Boy really enjoyed the Lemon Pepper wings and the Medium, the Spicy garlic made him sweat. My Teriyaki boneless were very good, well sauced with it getting in every nook and cranny of the breading.  Service was well done as well and we really enjoyed our visit to BW3. Game on!"}
{"text":"went to the new location at metro center today for their grand opening and my daughters 8th birthday. I expected it to be busy as it was but the service still could have been alot better! Iam a server so i understand being busy. Just about everything went wrong. First thing when we arrived the music was so loud i couldnt even hear my hostess and I had to scream it felt like just so she could hear me. Then im dealing with my four kids getting them settled and i have the server telling my about the drink specials but again the music was to loud i couldnt really hear him. The rest of my party arrives and we order drinks and the kids get their drinks the drinks we ordered    ( mango lemonaide)  took about 15 minutes, I had to grab a manager to get refills and check on our lemonaides.We order and about 20 minutes later half the food came out wrong and the server didnt even know he was holding my order, he thought it was something else, we didnt get our wings that got sent  back untill after we were done with our meal ... OH and our appertizer chips and salsa chips tasted stale and a few cheese sticks where missing the CHEESSE! which the server said he would get me some more and never did. When it came to the birthday shout out for my daughter they stopped half way through it and said they would be right back ???? then asked her what she wanted ... she chose chocolate cake... we got our check ..... still no cake.... we played at the toy machine ... stll no cake ... another waitress came by 3 different times and asked us if we got our cake promissed to get it.... still no cake .... asked our server 2 more times and paid our check then asked for the cake togo.... and STILL no cake. we waited about 25 minutes for her cake and had to leave with out it :( over all this was the worst experience i have ever had!"}
{"text":"This place is growing on me.  It has the feel of a sports bar and the food quality of a good sports bar :) .  They have great sauces for their wings, the onion rings were fabulous, the hamburger, while not the greatest hamburger ever, really hits the spot and you can put whatever you want on it.  Try the queso on it!  The bun wasn't crispy enough for me but the burger was cooked right!    There is always at least two tv's you can watch no matter which direction you face and the staff is friendly!  We will definitely come here when there is a sporting event! Even our picky kids like it!"}
{"text":"I have never been a \"wings\" fan in my lifetime.  Wings just remind me of dating in high school.....too much effort, and not enough meat.  I have not tried their wings, but they do look very good and smell delicious. I imagine if i were ever to partake in a wings experience, it would be here. I have had the tacos and they are pretty darn good. Along with the fried pickles. There are plenty of seats on the floor and at the bar each time I visited. Tons of tv's and every sport seemed to be tuned in. Service at the bar has always been stellar."}
{"text":"Food was not that great. Especially mac & cheese. And I ordered salad. Salad is very dry not enough dressing."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. This restaurant is garbage. The staff are rude and miserable. I highly recommend going to the Buffalo Wild Wings in Henderson Nevada. GREAT service and GREAT food! We sat 10 min waiting at our booth with no menu or drinks and when our waitress finally came she had the worst attitude for no reason. The whole dinner was a disaster."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Have been to this location a couple times and have always been happy with the service. We never have to wait very long to get a table although the servers (who all seem really young, high schoolers?) take a while to take our orders. Maybe because its so busy usually? Food wise I really like their wings but its not the best I've ever had. I appreciate that they have so many sauces but there is only like 2 or 3 that I actually like (garlic, honey bbq, and their buffalo dry rub). Everything else is kind of intense, either too hot, too spicy, or too salty. Its just a matter of preference. Got their onion rings last time which were delicious! They usually have good drink specials during happy hour. Will totally be back to this location."}
{"text":"I love coming here with my friends and family. The staff are always friendly and inviting. I've only been to this location 2 dozen times or so, but it is far better than any other location I've bee too. I don't think they've ever even gotten my order wrong. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"We wanted our favorite wing spot, East Coast, but didn't want to drive that far! And now I think we may have found a new spot.   Greeted warmly and seated quickly for a Friday night were two good indicators. And a 98 satisfaction rating? Yes! Then they asked the 9 year old if he wanted a tablet and it was a done deal!  Kelly, our waitress, was wonderful.  She let us sample sauces and helped us pick. Her selections were spot on. Friendly and attentive, we never had to look for her. Its like she anticipated our needs.   Fried pickles were an appetizing hit.   The little guy had a burger and hubby and I did wings: asian zing, thai curry and buffalo (dry rub). Wings took a little time to arrive but they were very good. One flavor was wrong but Kelly was quick to fix it."}
{"text":"Nothing new to say, it's a chain restaurant.   I'm here to talk about how awesome our server/bartender Mike M was tonight. He was really friendly, accommodating, and made our night awesome."}
{"text":"I just got wings from here and the location itself was really hard to find! So annoying! There was a long wait! The stupid wings had no sauce on them. The ranch cups were barely filled! This whole night was a major disappointment!"}
{"text":"Was a frequent customer at this location but not anymore. There is no sense of urgency and they seem to be slower when there are less customers. Today we waited 10 min to order drinks and decided to leave. On the way out what would have been our waitress was talking to a manager at the front about her schedule. They both said have a great day. Ummmm, how didn't they know we weren't even served?"}
{"text":"ive been here 100 times for all types of events and its a great place to eat, drink, and watch sports. I love the parmesaean garlic, teriyaki, and habenero sauces. The monthly beer specials isnt a bad deal for a tall domestic. Fries are also pretty good."}
{"text":"Well, we visit this place twice during a 6 day trip to Vegas. Sports bar atmosphere to the hilt! Probably the largest number of spices & sauces combinations you can have your wings or tenders cooked to order. Very reasonable. This place would absolutely kill Hooter's, Wing Stop, and Wings N Things back in San Diego. I know many of you would still go to Hooter's, but lets be honest, it isn't for the wings... :D If good chicken wings are what you're really after, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I great place to go to watch sports games. It was packed, so my friend and I decided (instead of waiting for a table) to go to the bar. We Were instantly seated right in front of the flat screens and had a perfect view of the game!  The only complaint I have, was that the server messed up our order and what sauces we wanted on our wings. We decided not to say anything cause we were starving and it took long enough to get our wings the first time.  The thai style and original sauces are my favorite! Must try.  And as always, boneless or it isnt happening."}
{"text":"I really wish there was a way to express how utterly despicable the service is at this particular location...maybe draw a picture of a turd rolled in burnt hair? Our waitress, Kim, spent more time discussing her gaming losses/wins than actually doing her job...I had better service when I was a guest in Guantanamo Bay...Not a refill for anyone at the table...as you can see from picture, zero food quality control...Look at the ratings...the manager here should be fired...won't be back, ever... Edit: also, Matt got really bad diarrhea."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a lower rating then this because I was refused service and could not eat here because of how young me and my friend look even tho we showed them our form of payment and to be quite Frank I feel that the manager and waiters at the time  8:50pm in Tuesday June 5th should be fired for the horrible way they treated two paying customers! They brought other people to watch us and it made me and my friend feel very uncomfortable because it felt as if we were in a unsafe environment"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I've been to this location, usually I go to the Meadowvale location. The food, as always was good, we got the Tuesday special $0.75 wings, Roasted garlic mushrooms (my personal favourite) and the Garden Crasher. Our server wasn't very attentive - my drink was never refilled and we weren't asked if we needed anything. Our food came all at once, we are used to apps coming before the wings so it cluttered the table. All-in-all you can't really go wrong with wings and apps, but service is what makes me come back and I find it better at another location."}
{"text":"Josh is THE BEST server! Food is always good. The manager Jeff Holloway is on point as well!!! He came to our table to ensure everything was OK. Great job!"}
{"text":"I only go to a BW3 if a friend insists.  They have Happy hour beer prices and some happy hour food offerings.  We happened to be there on 60¢ wing night.  We asked for the wings extra crispy and they were.  I am pretty sure they charged extra for ranch and blue cheese - which that is cheesy!  We had an order of 20 wings and we got a tiny plastic cup of ranch and 1 tiny cup of blue cheese.    The happy hour special were mini corn dogs, chili con queso dip (that's chili and chese dip) and onion rings.  I do enjoy greasy bar food, but  I could have done better at 7-11.    With the happy hour prices you really are just paying fair prices.  Basically, you get a discount on there overly inflated prices.  Hats off to the BW3's marketing and advertising team.  You are able to fill up a huge restaurant serving shitty overpriced food with bad service in a down economy.   They get one extra star for the variety of sports on TV's everywhere."}
{"text":"I just can't take it anymore... I was dragged into a BWW for the last time.  I hereby refuse to step into a BWW.  I don't care if all of my friends are there to hang out... I am not going.  I typically avoid chain restuarants if at all possible, and this is no exception.  I will not be fooled into believing that this a good place to go.  I am NOT a common dullard that can be lulled in because of some clever commercials... you wings suck!  They do have huge TV's everywhere and the service is okay... but so what!  Reasons for not liking this place;  1.  There wings suck!  Tiny little chicken wings.  They get tough with out being crispy.  Then they are drenched in some super sweet sauce of what ever... For $9 you get 12 tiny little wings served in a paper dish.  2.  The chicken tenders are terrible.  They taste like something you would get at a skating rink or some terrible concession stand.  They were not \"tenders\" as billed on the menu.  These were pieces of chicken all wadded up and super heavily breaded.  The blue cheese dressing had no blue cheese.  Ask me how I know there was no blue cheese...  \"Jason how do you know there was NO blue cheese in the dressing?\"  Well, becuase blue cheese is blue and it should be visible in a white sauce...  3.  Afterpaying $19 for tenders and wings there were 3 small paper containers of food on the table.  I want something more substantial for $19.  A measly offering of low quality chicken products served in cheap paper boats is just bad...  Again - I will not be fooled!  4.  I paid $5.75 for a regular size Blue Moon.  Maybe my exwife is right, maybe I am cheap!  But $5.75 for a regular size beer???    I am still pissed off - I hate this place.  If I went there to watch football on a Sunday it would cost me $80!!!    Small wings drenched in super sweet tasteless sauce - nearly $6 for a glass of beer... uuuhhhh... I vow never to return."}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  The manger, AJ is the most incompetent manager I've ever come in contact with.   He's flat out rude.  I think if he hates his job he should find a new one! The bartender, Colby (at least that's what named appeared on my ticket) is slow and has no personality.  When i asked him to check on my food because it was taking so long, he just stood there and never checked on it.  I guess that's why I got cold food.  Oh yeah, And some of it wasn't even in the bag! Score!!!!!  Don't go here.  They suck!  And this isn't the first bad experience.  It's just the first one that made me so upset that I felt the need to comment!  When you spend 30.00 on food and it's cold because it's sitting in the window, it's upsetting.  (I know it was sitting in the window because I could see it) But whatever you do, don't complain about it, the manager will just throw your food away and not offer to make you fresh.  So if you're up for cold food, this is your place!  So I just want to take a second and say thanks to AJ (the manger) for throwing my food away and not offering to make me fresh.   And thanks to the bartender, Colby for making us sit there nd never check on our food.   This all could have been fixed easy and quickly if the manager AJ new how to do his job.   But in the end, I was rude right back at him just like he was to me.  I think him shouting \" have a nice night\" as I walked out the door was a nice \"F\" you touch! So classy! And may I say, I'm a lady.  Not a dude! Thanks Buffalo Wild Wings for hiring someone who knows how to be a jerk to women!"}
{"text":"Down grading, sorry.  We've come here a bunch of times and sadly the food experience has declined overtime since the opening.  :( which sucks because I really wanted this spot to shine.  It's just meh, though.    The Manager is quick to take unsatisfactory things off the ticket which our waitress alerted him so it isn't the service - which is why this is a 3 and not a 2 - it is simply the \"whatever, send it out\" attitude the kitchen has that is the issue.  The hot Pretzels there are wonderful yet the queso which used to come out smooth and hot and dippable came out congealed and lumpy - yuck.   My husbands wings used to come out evenly dusted with his favorite lemon pepper spice but it came out instead with the lemon pepper literally just dumped on top.  Some wings didn't have anything but the portion exposed when the spices were dumped onto the top.    \"Whatever, send it out.\"  If they don't care - neither do I.  Pity, it isn't the service - just inconsistent whatever food."}
{"text":"Worst Buffalo Wild Wings location in the area. Servers are mostly helpful and friendly, but the food is consistently bad. Management is also extraordinarily rude and unprofessional. During our last visit, the manager kept hovering over our table and making inappropriate comments about the rest of the staff. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This use to be the place to go for college football. My buddies & I have spent a lot of Saturdays here. Most times it would be packed & we would have to get there at least an hour ahead of time to get a seat. O how times have changed. This past Sat was the final straw & we will never ever be back. My friend ordered a beer. Server brought it out & it was flat. Not a bubble in sight. He sent it back & he watched the bar tender actually dump out just a bit then top it off. Same beer & it sat up by the bar for a good 4-5 min & the server brought it back again. Flat as flat can be. We talked to a manager & I said \"the keg is bad better switch it out asap\" he said it was a brand new keg & he tapped it off himself & tried to show us with a small sample. Still barely any head. His attitude towards us was completely unprofessional & we felt like he was accusing us of being idiots like we had no idea what we were talking about. Strike 1. Would it be so hard to apologize & say hey so sorry let me try another one? We got nada. Strike 2 was they were charging $5 a head for the UFC fight that night if we stayed past 7 pm. We had been there since noon spending $$ & that wasn't enough? Last straw people. We are out. Best of luck to u Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"This place is just plain horrible.  We went for a friend's birthday party so we did not choose.  The wings are always so small and I don't know why but I swear in each order - there are always 3 broken bone wings.  I hate that.  We eat at Wild WIng in Ayrsley quite often and they never have broken wings.  The fries are nothing special.  They refer to them has fresh cut.  Fresh cut by whom?  The potato factory where they are made?  :-)  We won't go back unless its another group function."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always come here. I'm not gonna lie and say it's 5* cuisine and dining- it's yur typical bar food type menu. Burgers, sandwiches, wings, etc. I will say that we always get amazing service even on a busy game night!   I wanted to take the time to post this because I made an online order for pick up and it wasn't ready, and they said they never even got my order when I got here. Naturally, I wasn't happy and showed them my email confirmation to prove I placed the order. I was the ass of the joke and placed it for the wrong time! So here I am currently waiting for my food to be made and they're closed. The manager and young lady working the greeting counter went above and beyond to offer and volunteer to make sure I got my order and didn't even fuss about it! I'm very happy and satisfied and will definitely continue to be a customer here at bw3!"}
{"text":"Food was good, server fantastic and the restaurant was extremely clean and orderly. Chicken caesar had a great dressing on the chicken that the server said was one of their wing sauces. Boneless chicken wings were really good with sweet bbq sauce. Chipotle chicken BLT on naan was really good. Food arrived in about 10 minutes and was clean and fresh. Manager came by with a friendly Hi which was a very nice touch. We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service I received from Michael C. is ridiculous. I heard that some of the staff didnt like Steris Corp. employees and to wear regular clothes there. Tonight I wore more company shirt since we had less than hour getting off work and going there for a pleasant dinner. My party of 6 all received our dinners and tasted great, however, when it was time to pay the bill, I asked for a bag to go. He acknowledged np.. after tipping almost 20%  for great food, I reminded him for a bag to go. He said ok... Still did not receive a bag, so I asked a nearby waitress for a bag.. my co-workers told me he was prob upset cause i had my company shirt on and joked he prob was an ex-employee :P.. I ended up getting a bag from another waitress later on.  Bottom line, food is great, but dont wear a company Steris shirt or you might not get decent service depending on ur waiter/waitress...this also agreed from my fellow co-workers whom I should have listened to."}
{"text":"Decent wings, decent beer, decent apps.    Place is loud as hell and the service can be spotty. Pretty typical for a wings place regardless of which one you go to.   The venue is geared towards sports on all the televisions and they are loud.  Too loud in my opinion but I am in the minority it would seem."}
{"text":"Been to this location quite a few times, the atmosphere is almost always the same found at any of the BWW we've been to.  This was the second or third time I've called in an order to pick up.  When they tell you 10-15 min I need to learn that means 25-35 min.  It takes me about 15 min to get BWW from my house, I leave as soon as I complete the ordering process and always have to wait once I'm there.  This night I waited another 15 min after arriving, no BIG deal but aggravating. They always ask if you would like some water, which is nice; but what I really want is my food.  It also seems like they could be staffed in the wrong areas; there were 2 maybe 3 people working the front to pay/place your order and 1-2 working the front to seat others.  Maybe one more in the kitchen??"}
{"text":"We normally go to the other wing place in town because it's closer to our house but decided to give this place a shot since we had not been in since we moved to the area. We were hoping for some great happy hour specials, but it was only so-so. They seemed a little understaffed as we were halfway through our wings without plates or even a boat to put our bones in. The wings were ok, but I think I prefer our normal spot more.  The positives were the normal décor which is fun and they had several large TV's. The staff was friendly just slow. We may come in from time to time, but probably won't be regulars."}
{"text":"Service is usually good and food is better than most other BWW locations.  They don't dump all their reject chicken wings on you during Tuesday wing specials like other locations.  Food prepared well consistently and usually good about having the popular games on TV with volume.  Other locations may or may not have a big game on the right tvs and play music instead of the game.  Pretty sure it's supposed to be a sports bar.  This location seems to be the best in town!"}
{"text":"Food is always mediocre but affordable. Service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Look-the Madison/Monona area is hard up for a good wing place and BW3 is not going to solve that problem anytime soon. But some of the reviews here are a bit unfair. It's like reviewing McDonalds and complaining it's not the best burger of your life. This place is the McDonald's of wings with beer.  It's good for what it is. The service is friendly and both times we've gone there in the past month the manager comes around asking if everything is ok. Nice touch. The limited time Asian sauce is a good one and the relatively new mango habanero is really tasty. Somehow the bill always surprises me-as though I feel like I am getting ripped off for what I'm getting-but the place has little control over that. All in all, if you live in the area, this may be your only option for a variety of sauces from which to choose and if you keep in mind that this is the McDonald's of wings and beer it's not half bad."}
{"text":"I came here in support the Boys and Girls Club where my friend son goes after school. Half the proceeds from tonight go directly to the club. So, I spent money on a good cause.  With that being said it was super packed on this particular night. Especially due to the fact it was Friday and college football bowl week. Which is why it took 25 minutes for my 20pc Wings to arrive at my table. Meanwhile I had 2 strawberry iced teas. Watching Michigan lose in dramatic fashion to Florida State was the highlight of my night. The wings were ok, nothing spectacular. I've had better lemon pepper wings at Wing Stop honestly. I gave a 3 out of 5 simply because I'm a jerk and think it's \"fair\"."}
{"text":"I have never been the biggest fan of these restaurants, especially considering the Cleveland area has so many amazing local wing joints.  Other locations I would give a solid three stars because the food and drinks are just mediocre but not completely terrible.  I give this location a lower rating because there was creepy clientele trying to talk to and hit on my friends and i which made us extremely uncomfortable, as well as the food tasting like it came right out of a frozen box.  I would never go back to this location based on that experience."}
{"text":"First time here as a BWW veteran and these are by far the best tasting wings. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. Cleanest restaurant and nicest bartender Dani. Management came to greet us and thanked us for coming, thanks Daniel. Highly recommended to stop in. Feels very nice and comfortable. Great location"}
{"text":"They have Ms Pac-Man! We came here recently to watch the 49ers lose to the Saints--aargh!  It was a good game until the end.  I think.  I'm not really a football fan, but the b/f is, so when in Rome.  I'm learning a lot, though.  Like, people love them some football and if you're going to watch a game, BWW is the place to go. Customers and employees are decked out in football jerseys or their favorite team's t-shirts.  Even I was sporting a 49er shirt and I only have half a clue what's going on on the field.   The place was packed!  There were dozens of flatscreens playing every football game in the U.S., or so it seemed. We were seated next to Saints' fans and one lady kept giving us the evil eye--is there going to be a rumble?  I'm sure she was happy her team won.  Me?  I played a game of Galaga and Ms PacMan, 50 cents a game.  FOOD:  I shared the soft pretzels and  a small order of the boneless parmesan garlic wings with the b/f, with a side mac & cheese.  The pretzels were good and so were the wings, but the mac & cheese was runny.   We were there for more than two hours and our server was attentive the whole time, checking up on us throughout the game.  The best part of this place is that it's not smoky, so that's enough to bring us back for more wings and video games.  Oh, and football."}
{"text":"This is how our let's try something new night went: Traditional wings  Buffalo rub -10 Spicey garlic -5 Mayan-5  Boneless wings Honey barbecue-12 Asian zing-6 Dry buffalo-6    Overall the wings were good  Our server Cheyanne did exceptionally well making sure that our drinks were full and THAT is a big deal for me. Especially because some of these wings sauces we never had before and they were quite spicy(at least for myself they were) you can tell they change it up a little bit here with the menus and some of the stuff they were serving. Again they get four stars in my book because of the drinks!"}
{"text":"My favorite BWW. Great set up for watching football games. Super friendly staff!  Buffalo has the best wings, boneless and traditional."}
{"text":"About what you expect from a trendy chain: average food, average service average beer selection, average prices. Meh."}
{"text":"I've lived in this part of town my entire life and recently moved closer to this BWW. There are soooo many bars and restaurants in this 2 mile radius Soni had never been there before but my friends come here all the time and invite us over, well today I finally made the trip over and I will never come back here ever again. I met my friends up at the bar section and right as I got there I was carded by Kelly. She was alright, didn't have the most pleasant look on her face, she looked a bit stressed, a bit annoyed, but was still polite in her tone. She took my drink and food order and that was the extent of me dealing with her. Later I wanted another beer but she was not coming around so I ended up asking the next employee passing by if I could order from her. She said \"sure\" and I saw her go up to a tall skinny tattooed guy at the bar and say a few things and point at my group and then he looked at us and went to the register, got the drink, and came back and handed us the drink. Most of my stay there was meh (i wasn't offered water and my friends weren't offered water refills until someone asked which is unusual as typically servers are on top of refilling water) It wasn't until the game that we were watching was over and all my friends had closed out our tabs and tipped that this tall skinny tattooed guy named DOUG approached my friends and started yelling at them, literally raised his voice so loud  that the whole bar was staring and started yelling at them about how they were not allowed to sit there (at the bar) because of the machines and because they only played $15?! He literally said \"You guys are not allowed to sit here ever! You were told when you got here and you didn't play! This is how we make our money! And I can't tell you were to sit but you are not to sit here ever again for any games or ever\" AS IF THE $20+ THAT EACH OF US SPENT IN ONLY 1 HOUR, not including the generous tip considering their less than mediocre service,  DIDN'T COUNT FOR SHIT! He pretty much said he didn't care for our business even though my 3 other friends are  REGULARS (they are there every week!!!) Then he directed his yelling at me and my boyfriend and i who were not even sitting at a machine and who got there way after and whom he only interacted with when they got us 1 measly drink! And I will be totally honest, most bars, unless they are super busy, don't care if you sit at the bar and you're not gambling. If they do get busy and they have players that want to play, they will politely ask you to scoot over or will get a table for you to move to, NONE of the people working this bar did that or even mention it AND ALSO most of the people sitting along the bar were not playing either! I know this for a fact because I had made sure to observe it because I've been POLITELY asked to scoot to another seat before at bars like this but after looking at every one else, I thought we would be fine as there were  obviously many people  sitting at games who  were  not playing either! Including one couple that I observed just chit chatting the whole time who  got up, stepped outside through a side exit for 15 minutes, then came back to their seats in front of machines that were still wide open and available and we're not take. By ANYONE looking to gamble. And either way we were STILL paying customers fair and square! The whole way this asshole, Doug, approached us was incredibly unprofessional and rude. Shitty customer service and customer interaction. And you know what's funniest?! Prior to this review, there have been others who've complained about him too! Good going Doug, you just lost this already miserable location 3 regular customers and 2 new ones who will never set foot in this place again or ever even recommend it."}
{"text":"Waitress was really sweet! Blue Moons were $7 and I think B-Dubs is a little on the pricey side for quality of food anyway but it's always a good crowd and never any problems so I always come back. Lower your prices and it'd be 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Service by Karissa was great and the only reason they are getting more than 1 star. We had the Ultimate Chicken Nachos and Southwest Philly. Neither of them were anything more than mediocre. Both had disgusting cheese that tasted and looked like cheese whiz- the chicken on the Nachos was flavorless and there were maybe half dozen chicken cubes in total on the plate.  The portion size for what we paid would have been great if the food was decent, but it wasn't. The place was packed and too loud to be able to have a conversation. The music being played was good but too loud- this isn't a night club... Disappointing overall- but again service was great!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a black cherry mojito and a Caesar salad with no chicken. The bartender brought me a strawberry drink, I forming me that they were out of cherry a so that \"will just have to do.\" After 60mns I was brought a spring salad with chicken that I sent back. After 90minutes they brought me a chicken Caesar salad, at that point I just said forget it.  The 6 other people we dined with waited just as long with various problems with their order. We didn't receive our check until 2.5hrs after our order. To top it off a cockroach ran under our table while we were waiting. The management showed no interest in his staffs inability to serve.  Terrible experience, definitely never going back."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Picking up a to go order that was scheduled to be picked up at 3:50. I arrived at 4 and my order was still not ready. I asked the cashier at the pick up desk why my order was not ready..she rolled her eyes and with all the attitude in the world went to check on my order; apparently the extra crispy takes an additional 25 minutes to make. Don't promise a time if you can't deliver."}
{"text":"Yikes, it really was that bad. I'm not one for writing 1-stars, but BWW really made their case for it.  We ordered takeout for one of the March Madness games a month ago and were disappointed because one of the items was made wrong (the burger came plain even though we indicated a bunch of toppings in the online order). I called the location and a manager told me he was really sorry, that it was a computer issue they're aware of, and that he'd send me a voucher for the incorrect food in the mail. The problem? The voucher never came!   Against our best judgment, we went back and ate there, and my burger came out wrong, AGAIN. Luckily, the waitress was able to get the toppings on the side and bring them later. One of the toppings I had asked for was avocado and they charged $2 for it even though she didn't bring it until I was halfway done with the burger. Why?  I know it's a sports bar/wings kind of place, but they also have a TERRIBLE selection of wine. I'm not very picky with wine, but wow: talk about bargain brands and no variety. At least it was a decent pour.   One thing that's neat about BWW is that you can get \"veggie slaw\" and it's actually pretty good. A nice healthy alternative to the fries.   Needless to say, I will actively go out of my way to avoid this Buffalo Wild Wings location."}
{"text":"The location itself is pretty cool. The open dining room makes watching any sporting event a group activity (with all the other strangers in the bar).  Overall, the food is ok; the only vegetarian option is the black bean burger, which was a little dry.  Typically, service is pretty good and we have a good time when we go."}
{"text":"Standard B Dub food. Wings were tasty.  Beer mugs were not chilled and bartender was pleasant but disinterested in her customers. Dirty plates and glasses were noticeable in the bar area. Took a while to get refills on water or even another beer but the bar was maybe half full.  Not the usual experience I've become accustomed to at Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"I have been to many BWW's in Vegas. This one has the worst service. Drinks take too long and your food is an even longer wait. Not to mention if you need to ask the waiter for anything. Not to mention the non questionable items, such as filling up a soda or water.  Just head down to the one on Craig."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service! We left another location and came to this one only to have all our expectations exceeded. Our water glasses were never less than halfway full, and our server was so friendly. I highly recommend this location to anyone, even if you have to drive a little further. We were even given a free dessert for a birthday. This Buffalo Wild Wings will always be a winner!"}
{"text":"This management is a joke. They don't train their employees right. Come to find out it's a \"corporate location\". We literally sat for 20 minutes without anyone coming to get even drink orders. Then when they finally arrived we were informed that they can't accept the coupon that we got in a text from a \"franchise location\". I'm astonished that after making us wait for so long they wouldn't even give us the courtesy of that discount that BUFFALO WILD WINGS was offering. Stay away from corporate stores in this chain."}
{"text":"This was hands down a 0 star experience - but, lucky for B-Dubs, Yelp does not allow such a rating.   The servers did not even try to serve our table around 9pm on a Saturday in a practically empty restaurant.  There was a table of 8 of us and getting service involved one of us waving in some ridiculous way and saying \"excuse me\" very loudly to one of the near by waitresses - who, by the way, seemed to have thought filling condiment bottles was more important than customers.  Which is complete logic.  Don't even get me started on the rage that an empty ketchup bottle can drudge up if I'm in one of my moods.  It's scary.  Even when we did get someone to the table to order a beer, they never once asked anyone else at the table if they wanted anything and instead turned and ran away before we could ask for anything else.  With 6-7 empty glasses, how this is acceptable I'm not even sure.    Having grown up in Ohio back when this place was more commonly known as \"BW3\" I have always had a special place for them, even through their transformation to an oversized and poorly managed chain.  After that experience, I can confidently say that I will be boycotting any and all Buffalo Wild Wings establishments in the future."}
{"text":"I worked for this location from when it first opened august 2013 to May of this year, but I'm gonna talk about my experience as a costumer not an employee. Pros: employee discounts, the atmosphere is just exciting, my server/coworker did a wonderful job with my birthday dinner last year (I turned 18, now I just turned 19, man time flies) and the guest experience captains were very engaging.  Con's: during my Saturday night off I went there for my senior prom for dinner and the food took an hour to come out. I don't know what my coworkers were doing in that kitchen (probably goofing off as usual or arguing) but they needed a kick in the ***. If it wasn't for my manager god knows when I would've gotten my food. Our prices are rising and I notices portions getting smaller. Not good. You guys wanna make sure that if you're going to have guest spending at least 50 bucks then give them quality.  I put 3 stars but I actually wanna give them 3.5"}
{"text":"I went back twice since, and have to be honest both times was good food and great service. And I never told the servers about my previous experiences so I really do think it was a one off."}
{"text":"Good food but watch what time you come in it gets packed here but other than that it's good"}
{"text":"This place is a nightmare. YOU ARE SERVING CHICKEN WINGS, NOT GOLD NUGGETS. The price is outrageous. 2 people, no alcohol, dinner menu. With tip- $60. What are you people thinking???? I hear you can get some good deals on the lunch menu. Will not be finding out. Need to take a second mortgage to eat here. Not worth the expense. Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Love it. Buffalo Wild Wings Vegas , perfect to start your night. Bar tenders are spot on , never let you get dry & the food is excellent!!! Just the way you ordered!! I'll BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"As a follow-up to my previous review, there's one other helpful hint.  We used to go to BWW for the UFC events. However, UFC100 was the last one we'll see. We arrived 2 hours in advance to find people saving seats in the bar, and unable to get a seat in the dining room. In the end, we were seated with a bunch of teenagers in a large booth.  If I arrive two hours early AND pay a cover, I kinda expect semi-comfortable seating. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I really want to like it here.. I  so do..  It's so close and they have wings and beer and some of the better b dub servers I've encountered,  but also some of the worst. Depending who is your wait staff can swing from why are you working here and not at a 5 star establishment, to are you on parole?   Food and beer doesn't change much from location to location and here is no different.  They have a nice misted patio which I like, but they also inherited a smoking license which is cool if your a smoker, I'm not.  If only they would take corporate lead and air the PPV UFC's here I would easily come here over my normal fight bar, but they dont, and which I can't go higher than 3 stars...  Side note: they got rid of my favorite feature, free refills on their lemonades!!"}
{"text":"The TVs on the patio suck. If you come here to watch the game stay inside. We got tricked into going outside.  Awful.  Get here early to get a good seat."}
{"text":"The food here is really good.  There are so many different sauces to choose from, even if you don't like wings you can get the sauce and dip other stuff in it- fries, chicken strips, grilled chicken tenders, etc.  Our service wasn't bad when we came.  Tons of TVs all over to choose from and they have the sound on for the games.  I just wish they would dim the lights a little.  It's very bright in here."}
{"text":"Horrible Service!!!  Waited forever just to be acknowledged walking in. Then waited 20minutes for someone to take our order, with a waiter who kept wiping his sweaty forehead with his hand. Super gross to watch.  All of this and I haven't even had something to eat yet, and not sure I want to. At least the football game is on."}
{"text":"I went back here last night because I got home late and couldn't think of another place that would be open. Well, this experience was much less impressive than last time. We had a clueless waitress. She was extremely slow. We got drinks, which were fine, but extremely overpriced (the BF got a beer and it was 6$?!?! more than my cocktail! WTF). We also got water to go with our wings. So we got our wings, which were fine, but then the waitress disappeared. Our waters remained empty for a looong time. We also waited about 25 minutes to get our check. It was ridiculous. So when we finally got the bill, I noticed we were charged about 3$ for carrots and celery. Really??? I thought when she asked if we wanted some with the wings, it was a standard thing. I've been going to Buffalo wild wings for 6 years and have never been charged for carrots and celery. In addition, we got like 5 scrawny carrots.... we didn't even eat it all, we just figured we'd get some with the wings cuz why not? Well, we found out why not. So we pay, and on the way out, we found out what was keeping our waitress so busy while we sat there waiting for ridiculous periods of time- She was sitting at the front of the restaurant with about 5 other employees talking. Seriously?!?! That is ridiculous. I am all for enjoying work and even chatting a bit, but they should at least have a view of the dining room in order to attempt to give decent service. I really don't want to continue giving my business to this company after that experience."}
{"text":"Great place for wings and the tvs are great. Thursday nights they have live trivia and prizes. Its hard for a sports fan not to like this bar."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery.  They got all the sides right but they substituted something completely inedible in place of the wings.  Then they refunded the wings.  So, I got a bunch of sides, a few drinks, and a couple boxes full of hot garbage but they were gracious enough to refund the hot garbage part."}
{"text":"Went last week on wings night with my teenagers who can eat ! Specifically went on the special night as they were supposed to be cheaper. I asked the waitress \" its wings night tonight right?\" She said yes and we proceeded to order. Well imagine my surprise when my bill was $60. I told her I thought the wings were on special. Her response ?  \" oh only the bone in wings \"   ?!?! What ? I asked her before I placed my order and she said nothing that it was for a specific type of wing.   Needless to say , I won't be returning as this felt like a bait and switch or omission of information so you order the more expensive ones."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I go for Buzztime trivia and Boneless wings on Thursdays. On Tuesday and Thursdays they have you can say sales on wings. Tuesday if you like bone in Thursday for boneless. One down fall for those days is that if you want ranch or blue cheese it cost extra because the wings are cheap. The other days the sides are included.  The choices of different flavors are good as well as the variety of appetizers. They happy hour is excellent with cheap appetizers and four dollar margaritas. You do have to be aware of any sport games that are going on or special events because it can get crowded.  Over all good trivia, good food, good drinks."}
{"text":"Slow service and slightly overpriced.  I went here with my girlfriend and her coworker for lunch. The place is new and experiencing some growing pains. The hostess didn't know what to do with us and although the place was empty, we were left standing at the entrance for a good five minutes. The food tastes good but the portions were small, specifically the fries. There were so few sweet potato fries I ordered another basket of them (the bigger of the two options) thinking I would take home whatever was left over. That unfortunately wasn't the case. For another $4 or $5, I got a measly portion of sweet potato fries that I finished easily.  I left the place feeling hungry and a bit ripped off. I am not eager to visit again. It also took quite some time to receive our orders. Our drinks were finished before the food came."}
{"text":"We walked in and checked in, and were told high top tables were open seating and luckily we found one right away. After a few minutes, we got our menus, and were given some of the best customer service here that I have ever received. Our waiter, was on his game! Kept coming around to check if we needed anything, to see how our food was and was just great!!! The atmosphere of this place was amazing! I have been to other       B-Dubs, and the waiters are rude, and the service has been horrible! Not at this one! Best part, the manager was walking around interacting with guests make sure everything was going great, and was just doing an amazing job! By far the best   N b-dubs I've ever been too! 5/5"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and really bad service.  Visited several times over the past couple years, and after a string of terrible experiences finally decided enough was enough.  Of course there are a few exceptions, but most of the hopelessly incompetent staff will consistently forget orders, have you wait thirty minutes for your drinks while chatting with coworkers by the bar, and finally bring out orders up to forty-five minutes apart at the same table in a mostly empty restaurant.  All of this makes sense when witness to one of the clearly inept managers \"working\" on any given night.  At the end of the day, though the prices are OK on certain days, the food is not nearly good enough to make up for the awful service and just adequate environment -- which smells like pine cleaner and frying oil."}
{"text":"Visiting family in town and decided to get some wings for dinner. This had to be the best BWW that I've been to that excelled my expectations for customer service. The whole time from start to finish had been a great dining experience. Jorge was our waiter and he was on it. He's definitely a great asset to the team. 5 stars at this location. They even open the doors for you when you leave. Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Worst buffalo wild wings I've ever been to service is terrible really they just don't care not even with this bad review hopefully corporate open it's eyes to this horrible bdubs. When we came in we're not greated or acknowledge at all all the employees just standing around it's not like it was busy that day, we didn't even make it to a table we just walked right out after waiting several minutes, thanks but no thanks wasn't setting my self up for disaster. Will definitely never go to this location again."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here on Tuesdays when they have the buy one get one free. It's usually hectic and full of people. Service is slow but it's to be expected with how many people they have to serve. Even when I call an order ahead I usually have a wait for my food to come out. The staff is polite and helpful. I'm a big fan of chicken wings and enjoy the honey barbecue, mango habanero, and lemon pepper. Not much else I can say about this place, if you're looking for wings/beer/sports, this is the place."}
{"text":"I really don't have a whole lot to say that is positive about this particular location except that it was clean. We had a group of 14 people in our party 6 adults and 8 teenagers. We got seated pretty fast but that is where the compliments end. We sat there almost 15 minutes before anyone came by to get a drink order as soon as the drinks came we put in our food order it was 7:00PM it was 7:55 when our food finally came out and half of the food was stone cold when it finally arrived. To add insult to injury during the 55 minute wait for our food our server did not once come back to see if we needed additional beverages or refills for the kids.   I don't know what is going on with the management if this location but they need to train the staff a little better they lost sales of additional drinks and she lost out on a bigger tip.   Hope they do better next time! With teenagers in the house I know we will be back:("}
{"text":"Horrible service. Had to find a server and then every time we ordered we had to go find them again. Went specifically to watch the Packers play only to find that they didn't have that channel. Food was expensive and nasty. The manager looked inept. Had to stop at 5 guys burgers next door to feed my families hunger. Won't go back."}
{"text":"The service is slow, the wait staff lacks knowledge of their menu.  They were hella rude and slow as molasses. The food wasn't that good and the first time they brought food out they started putting plates on the table and the food wasn't even ours. So they had to take it off the table and I hope they didn't serve it since we had touched the food taking fries off and eating them. Then we realized it wasn't even our food.  They claimed they were busy but if that was busy I'd hate to see  how they handle an actual  full restaurant.   Also I ordered coffee and they didn't have any made and it took 20 minutes to get coffee.  Hey don't ha e creamer   The most unorganized place I swear I have ever been. I'm pretty sure they needs some training."}
{"text":"Good food! Good service! I had a burger and a salad and my husband had the two hottest sauces put on his wings and loved it! Four stars as opposed to five only because we were there at an off time and the place was not busy or crowded but our food took forever to come out. However, once it came it was worth the wait! Husband liked the TVs all over the place.  Don't go here with spouse/significant other if you are hoping to have conversation (ha-ha). We will be going back again!"}
{"text":"So this horrible night began with me taking my date out to dinner for their birthday. We arrive there at around 10:20pm so as you can imagine the restaurant was pretty slow. It took the server at least 10 minutes to grab a drink order, keep in mind they were just plain waters.  We placed our order for our food then we waited an additional 45 minutes to get our food. We ordered an appetizer and received it with our entrees. We asked for extra sauce and she failed to bring the sauce. she offered us carrots while taking the order. She never told us it was an extra charge.  We later saw they were charged to our bill and she did not even bring them out.  we were not offered a refill on the drinks. The food was bland and definitely needed the extra sauce( that we didn't receive) we asked if they did anything special for birthdays and she said no so we went ahead and ordered a cake which took another 10 minutes to receive. It was not even warm like the menu said it would be. And she didn't even deliver it. Some random employee dropped it off with no clean silverware to eat it with. So we had to clean off our dirty dinner forks to eat it. After we finished our dessert we wanted to leave ASAP but just like our whole experience our server was no where to be found. We ended up having to ask a busser for boxes because we had lots of food to package up..  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! I ordered Togo food and they literally threw all my food in the bag! The sauce went everywhere! And when I got home I had to re heat everything because it was all cold! Including the fries! The wings and fries taste like it was made two days ago! Horrible"}
{"text":"I never expected much from this place, just a good, filling lunch with my husband.  We both - FOR HEALTH REASONS - do not eat red meat.  My husband has a long line of heart disease from drinking and red meat, so he doesn't eat red meat.  I do not eat it too to be healthy and to support him.  You'd be shocked at how many people make him feel like crap because he's a man who doesn't eat meat, regardless of the fact that his dad was on his death bed just last year from it until he was rushed a new heart.    Anyway, getting back on topic....  I ordered the black bean burger and my husband ordered a different dish that was meatless as well.  This order was to go, as we had somewhere to be in an hour and a half.  When we got our food (the wait was fine) they read off the receipt, which I appreciated, while pointing at the boxes of food, then we left with our meal.  We got home (we don't live far) and started scarfing our food so we could leave in time.  After three bites of my meal I wondered to myself why it tasted so weird and why I felt nauseous.  I scraped off the sauce and took off the toppings to find they hid a meat patty.  Some people would be annoyed at this, but I haven't eaten meat for many years.  My body can't handle it.  So I was PISSED.  HOW the hell did they manage to put a meat burger in place of a black bean vegetarian burger?!  I immediately got back in my car with the remainder of my meal and drove right back to this place.  I went up to the girl WHO TOOK MY ORDER INITIALLY and told her that she messed up and gave me a meat burger not a vegetarian burger.  She looked at my receipt and said, \"oh, I must have put it in as a black and blue burger instead of a black bean burger.\"  Did she apologize?  NO. She just looks at me and says, \"do you want to talk to a manager?\" I said of course I did, shocked that she didn't even care enough to apologize.    The manager came out and, after I explained to her what happened, she was very shaken and went to the kitchen to tell them about the screw up.  But she never talked to the girl who messed up my order.  The kitchen didn't know because she typed in the wrong order!    The manager came back to me with TWO $5 off gift cards.  Not ONCE did anyone offer to refund me for my meal, or even just the burger that I obviously wasn't finishing.  I had to fight for the refund for a few minutes before they agreed to it.  I was sick to my stomach from the meat for a few hours after, but thankfully it never came back up.    This place does NOT give two craps about you or your food coming out right.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"This place has horrible service wont be going to this location ever. We were a party of 4 two kids waited almost an hour to not be seated.as we wait we see other be seated before us not having to wait. Asked the front service people how much longer till we be seated and keep telling us same thing \"Oh there cleaning the table for you guys\" we had asked twice already and they were still cleaning same table for 15min so decided to walk out. What a disappointment of service. If I could it be no stars for me"}
{"text":"This bdubs is right down the st from me naturally it is my go to restaurant for wings!!   I'm usually there late night and Sonya has helped me a couple times at the bar!   She is awesome and always has a smile on her face.   Every time I go in I want to try something different but always go back to Asian zing and desert heat! My two favorite flavors."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! Order 45 min. ago.  Waited 45 min for a water with lemon.  Managers advice everything takes longer on Tuesday.  This all the fault of management when attitude is blasé your employees will be blasé.    The saga continues we are still waiting for wings. And waiting!"}
{"text":"brought my mom here for her first time. whatever you do AVOID the short chubby waitress, she wears glasses and has short hair.   we were seated fairly quickly by the hostess and waited patiently for our waitress. she took her time getting to us, it wasn't busy at all so no excuse for taking almost 10mins to even get our drink order. when she finally showed up, took our order, came back put 2 of the 3 drinks down, threw our straws on the table and said she'd be back. took her another 8mins to bring the last drink. she brought our appetizers seriously 15mins after ordering, my mom asked for more napkins and when she came back she literally THREW the napkins on our table. at that point I seriously almost lost it and cussed her out! she took FOREVER to get refills, never checked up on us once and seriously just sucked as a waitress!   needless to say, she was absolutely RUDE, careless and seriously needs to be let go. the food was good, but having her as part of your staff is seriously going to drive customers away."}
{"text":"Can you say over rated? Buffalo Wild Wings is lucky that I love chicken wings other wise this place wouldn't even sniff a 3 star rating. Why you ask? Well for one thing their wings were tiny tiny tiny. For the price we paid just doesn't cut it for how far this place is from my sisters house, just doesn't cut it. I know we got a Buffalo Wild Wings place back in the Bay Area but it's about 20-30 minutes away, but after this experience with wings, I probably won't be coming to any Buffalo Wild Wings, unless I really had no choice.  The sauces here was bad! I'll be quite honest here, I am use to Wing Stop Wings a sauces but by no means am I comparing how they make their wings here to Wing Stops. I have enough wing experience to know that BWW didn't look to appealing. For one thing the garlic parmesan flavor just looked like throw up, but already having to buy it, I had to try it. It had a lot flavor, not that I don't like flavor, its just that it seemed like it had to much flavor, but my main question is who will like to eat something that looked like vomit sauce? Well, ya I did, but I can assure you that I wasn't pleased eating it. The other flavor that I got on my wings were the Caribbean Jerk and even that wasn't great, it had a little spice and kick but not the flavor I was hoping for. My son ordered the mini corn dogs and what it looked like he got was corn breaded vienna sausages, if my son wanted vienna sausages I could of just got a can of e'm and warmed e'm up with some rice (he probably would of enjoyed e'm better) I'm just a bit disappointed on how badly our food turned out and how not great it tasted.  I'd hate to put this place down because I LOVE chicken wings, and like I said this place would be anything lower than 3 stars without my love for chicken wings. If it wasn't for how cool how this place looked with all their sports TVs, cool little trivia games for the kids and huge obsession with chicken wings, believe me this place would get 2 stars.  P.S. Please Buffalo Wild Wings, upp your game up and stop serving those dinky little wings that don't fill me up unless I buy 20 wings to myself and then at the end of the day you guys charging me over priced little wings. Maybe think about changing the vomit sauce, it doesn't look very appealing."}
{"text":"Very good service with Melissa  our waitress, even the manager was walking around chitchatting with customers. Our food was good and fresh tasting."}
{"text":"If there's one food that is insanely overpriced, it's chicken wings. Costco charges $9 for a huge, couple pound bag of raw, frozen wings that you can put any sauce, breading, seasoning, what have you on it. This place... $8.99 for 12 wings - not even big wings!  So I heard about the spicy wing challenge and wanted to give it a try. 12 wings, in their spiciest sauce, in 6 minutes. When my friend Gracie C. told me that Jerry J. and I were going to meet her and her husband there for dinner last night (7/27/11), I knew I was going to try the challenge.   I ordered a glass of milk so that my stomach wouldn't cramp after eating the wings. Everybody ordered chicken fingers, and we got a $3 basket of mozzarella sticks and a $3 basket of garlic mushrooms. I said I wanted to do the challenge and the waitress told me that they no longer do the picture taking thing if you win, but you have a chance to buy a shirt if you do... cheap!  The (assistant?) manager brought out the food and asked if I was ready. He set my food down... and walked away. What? Nobody to time me?  If that was how it was going to be, I want my dipping sauce and celery, dang it.   My friends seemed disappointed, so Jerry timed me. Unfortunately, I was about to bite into it when Jerry said, \"in 15 seconds, start.\" Dang! At first, I thought, \"oh, okay, this is going to be a cakewalk.\" That is, until the sauce on my tongue started to heat up fast before he said \"Go!\" I was able to eat 10/12 in 6 minutes. If it wasn't for that premature tasting, I could have easily finished on time. The wings are hot, but don't taste like much. Make sure to keep the sauce off of your lips and the roof of your mouth. I have a few baby blisters on the roof of my mouth and I'm not too happy about  it. The wings were hot for the sake of being hot, but there was no real spice flavor to them. :( Soyo's spicy chicken is hotter but less blistering because you can eat it while drinking.   I snuck off to go pay Jerry's + My tab...  -12 wings $8.99 - 6 chicken strips $9.29 - side of wedge fries with cheese $.99 - and bacon $.50 - side of fried mushrooms  $3.00 - 2 glasses of milk $4.38 (???!!!) - 2 Michelobs $6.00 - a glass of water, tax and a $5 tip  Came to... $40.86!   That's stupidly overpriced. I don't like that the waitress asked if I wanted more milk but didn't tell me there were no free refills, especially because milk wasn't on the menu where I could look it up myself. I also didn't like that she didn't give me any more water refills after I paid, even though I paid fairly early as the other people were all still eating.   I will stick to cooking wings at home for pennies on the dollar. The fact that it's not dark as a cave, like where we were seated, is also a plus. Did I have a good time? Yes, but that was because I was with my friends, not because we were at BWW. The restaurant experience was just \"meh.\""}
{"text":"I don't understand why my parents like this place. They get the $.45 wings to go on Tuesday - and then bring them home and cook them for a little longer at home. Pretty much defeats the purpose of getting food to go so you won't have to mess up the kitchen.   The spicy wings have a weird flavor and the wait time was over half an hour when I went with my dad on 12/27/11 and ordered our food to go. No bueno."}
{"text":"Service, atmosphere, and food are just all okay. It's only the 60 cent wings and happy hour specials that make it worth.  Typical bar vibe. I only ever get bone-in wings and sometimes they end up dry - it's a hit or miss. The only flavor I really like is spicy garlic. The rest are just ok and the lemon pepper is downright horrible compared to Wingstop.  I'd only go here if I was in the area and it happened to be happy hour. Lots of TVs to watch sports if that's your thing.  Warning: It gets really cold at this location (at least all the times I've been there).  Tip: Get the regular fries with chipotle bbq seasoning! Pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Grown men in football jerseys, tons of little kids and overpriced beer...who decided to create a family friendly sports bar? It was my first and last time. I do have to say our server - Chi/Chia? Was incredible and a saving grace for the whole experience. All of the staff appeared to do well at their jobs. Guess I'm just not a $8 beer/basket of boney wings/screaming toddlers on their iPad/inattentive parents getting drunk kinda gal."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service - and by that I mean zero customer service. We went in to pregame and play some Golden Tee. First issue: the machine is in the worst spot, we were constantly having to get out way of customers and staff, because the game was right in the traffic flow to the bar. Second issue: we were there for over 45 minutes and the only interactions we had with any staff was when they bumped into us while we played.  We were never asked if we would like something to drink or eat. On our way out we spoke to a manager and where told that the servers were trained to ignore people playing at those games. No apologies or offers to make it right. Just an explanation that this is how they train their staff to treat their customers."}
{"text":"This is the normal Bdubs fare... Molly is very good at her job..  got a table in bar and a beer in hand within 5 minutes and probably closer to 3.  Wings are good, beer was cold... I have shifted and really like Sam Adams winter lager.  Molly made this Bdubs better than it might be and almost pushed me to a 4 star...because of service.  Gets the normal AUS students.. but that is not a bad thing."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and had the wing combo that gives you both boneless and traditional wings along with fries. It's big enough to share with 2 people. Not bad for $15. Sean is a great bartender. Normally when we come at night he's always the one helping us and very attentive and nice. It's down the street from our house and it's great when there are sports events on tv to watch."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great drinks, our waitress, Janina, was so wonderful, it's nice to know there is still customer service out there."}
{"text":"Well we got here at 10:15pm when their hours are until midnight... went to put in an order and we were told we can only get salads and something that's cooked in a fryer since they already shut off their grill and oven. We decided to get the check for our 1 water and 1 beer..."}
{"text":"Nothing like wings margarita and Fantasy basball,"}
{"text":"This location as failed me once again ... 2 stars because their service is good BUT come on. At least have my order right !!! I even checked it before I left too. I assumed it was right because the label said hot. But it wasn't hot bbq....    Ordered 10 parm garlic. 5 hot. 10 hot BBQ. & 5 honey BBQ. They gave us two free basket of fries because they didn't give us our fries last time.. I took a video and picture as proof in case they might turn my back on me. Come on. Why would I lie about the food I ordered ...   AND I ORDERED THEM EXTRA WET... my wings aren't even extra wet....  Again only 2 stars because of the service including The manager. Thank you again for another good credit."}
{"text":"An order of boneless wings and french fries to go was $14. I should have walked out. The wings were bland and mushy. Will never go back."}
{"text":"This was a surprisingly good experience at BWW. The waitress was fast, nice and she could actually remember what we wanted. We had a small complaint and she immediately took care of it. Really happy with the service and the food is what is to be expected. Good job waitress, sorry I don't remember your name."}
{"text":"Come in on Veteran's day and got a great meal on the house. Thanks BWW."}
{"text":"We tool our 9 and 10 year old sons there last night before seeing a movie.. it was loud like a school cafeteria the condiments on the tables were all empty and floor was dirty. The kids ordered boneless wings and they were hard as a rock dry and terrible. The drinks were 3 dollars each for ice tea and coke. Waste of time and money!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the places that I go to often when in rivergate. My boyfriend likes this place because of having many TVs and my sisters likes this place because of the wings. I like this place also and I like their fries. The servers are nice and quick. The place has a pretty good amount of seatings"}
{"text":"Lunch wasn't too busy so I can't say that was a valid excuse for bad service.  Got sat and ordered pretty quick.  Drinks came pretty fast too.  Appetizer never came and food took awhile for what we ordered.  Must have sat under the heat lamp in back for awhile because everything was dry.  I'm sorry but as a server you have 1 job.  Will never come back."}
{"text":"BEST SERVICE WE'VE EVER HAD. Period. The server, Dustin, was very knowledgeable and was able to give honest opinions on the wings to sway us into our best choices. Plus, he gave us his full attention, with constant check ins. The food was also amazing; from mozzarella sticks with extra melty cheese (since we've encountered plenty of places where the cheese was hardly melted) to an amazing selection of wings flavors (we got 5 different flavors and loved every one!). This location is definitely going to become one of our regular spots for date night."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon 130 place isn't very busy server took our order which was Ultimate nachos without jalapeños two drinks and a snack of honey barbecue  boneless wings. Server brought out the drinks right away everything was great server returns to the table with the two appetizers notices before she sets down the nachos that there's jalapeños all over it she says she'll take it back and have have it come out with no jalapeños. I watched her walk back to the kitchen she could've been back there for 30 seconds so obviously all that tells you is that they just picked off the jalapeños now for me that's fine I can still eat it but Stephanie can't eat that so you know there's juice or seeds or whatever but yet they failed to realize that also in there pico de gallo is quite a bit of jalapeños. So I mentioned that we don't really want that order of nachos due to the fact of the jalapeños and the pico de gallo she then stated she has to check with the manager which is puzzling to me because either you get a something we're going to eat or were not going to pay pretty simple. It's just funny how I know I saw her right down no jalapeños and the kitchen staff can't beside whether not you want jalapeños or not and then they give it to you in two different fashions seems like every time we come to this restaurant which this may be the last time we have issues with the orders we keep trying to come back but Pizza Hut's chicken wings are just as good. Also it seemed as though the chicken wings had been deep-fried twice they were super crunchy hard but there was no way I was going to send them back to"}
{"text":"Worst service along with terrible food. One guy started vacuuming with the most obnoxious loud screeching vacuum I asked him to shut it off he said he didn't care if people got up and left and that he was just doing his job"}
{"text":"I ordered wings for takeout last night so we could watch the game at home.  They said it would be 20 mins and I was there exactly when they told me to be there.The food was ready and I drove straight home. When I got home the wings were so completely dried out and hard. There was absolutely no meat on the wings,it was only completely dried out hard skin stuck to bones. I attempted to pull hard dried out leather off of bones. This meal has horrible and so unsatisfying I ate a bowl of cereal. Buffalo wild wings should have the best wings ever, these were the worst ever. I will never come back."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times. Great place to relax, grab some wings and watch the game. The wings and appetizers are your best bet though food wise. Can't go wrong with 20 different flavours to choose from and a nice cold beer. Honey BBQ are my go-to flavour and have the perfect mix of sweet with chicken. Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"We stopped for a post-concert snack while traffic cleared! The margaritas were mediocre (syrups only, no fruit was involved), the grilled \"naked\" tenders were pretty good. The hot wings were \"OK\".   The one star is because the service SUCKED. There weren't that many people there to explain why we waited forever for our food, were told at least twice that it was \"coming right up\" but obviously wasn't, had to ask for more water (it's 114 at midnight for heaven's sake - fill the water). I asked for a fork for the grilled tenders (duh), and the waitress dropped two sets of silverware on the corner of the table by my husband without a word or even a glance. That's why you got no tip, and why this place is getting one star, and why we won't be back."}
{"text":"So I go to many differnet BWW locations including in California (OC, IE), but since I go this location the most out of all BWW...I'll write a review for this location.  Atmosphere: Sports bar type with a lot of TV's showing any and almost every sporting event that is going on.  Great for family or hanging out with friends to catch the game. The restaurant has 2 sections; full bar side (gotta be 21 and over to sit in there) and restaurant side (everyone) Compete against everyone in the restaurant with the trivia games on the tv screens with game controllers (upon request) while you wait for your food.  My food picks: Wings - Garlic Parmesan is my favorite, all the other flavors are pretty good, such as spicy garlic, buffalo, asian zing. The only flavor I would stay away from is the Caribbean Jerk.  I prefer the Seasoned wedges over fries, but onion rings are always a bonus  Southwest dippers are delish and the mini corndogs and mozzarella sticks are good munchers too!  Overall good experience for a wing place and/or to catch the game and/or grab a drink!"}
{"text":"We were invited to a friend's surprise birthday dinner at BWW yesterday. The guest of honor and his girlfriend (the planner) were running late, and the wife and I ended up being the first people from our group. We were told to ask for our party's table, the hostess said they don't take names/reservations, and she didn't know anything about it. Turns out, the General Manager either doesn't know how to inform her employees of group reservations, or her employees just don't know how to do their jobs. After the rest of our experience, I am leaning toward incompetent employees.  Once the planner called and talked to the hostess and explained everything to her, suddenly a group table was set up. We were seated and had our drink order taken relatively quickly. That first round of drinks turned out to be the ONLY one I got. If you aren't drinking alcohol, the waitstaff does not care to check up on you. And, one of their families or close friends was a table over from us, you can guess where the service went.  I have been privy to many large group activities with menu based ordering. Intelligent staff will either section off the order or at least make notes as to where the food goes. Not sure if our order taker did that, as the staff that brought out the food would stand, literally, next to tables about 5 feet away from us and use a normal speaking voice asking us who's food was in her hands.   If you have never been to a BWW before, they are big rooms with maybe a dozen or more TV sets playing sports. Add to that, a couple large parties in the room (one of which was having a great time laughing constantly), the room gets a bit loud. It is OK in that situation to speak up, or get closer to the table to ask where the food goes. Enunciation and speaking up are important too. Many of us could only discern partial words coming out of the server's mouth when asking about the food in her hands.  The food was OK, nothing spectacular, for us at least. The couple across from us ordered some wings (were brought the wrong type boneless vs bone-in) and one batch had such a horrific flavor she could not stand the first bite. The servers never came by to ask if the food was ok, and this girl was too polite to yell at someone to get their attention.  Our food order included some sides to dip our food in, which were never received, but still on our check. We, of course, had those taken off. The $5.00 \"service charge\" for our large group is a bit of a crock. Had we gotten service, the staff would have been given nice tips. Being that we were forced to pay that much, that was about $4.95 more than they deserved.  If you want a sports fan friendly place to drink over priced alcohol and eat overpriced food, BWW is a decent enough place to get raucous with your friends.  However, if you would like to get what you order, have your drinks refilled AT ALL and enjoy your visit, you may want to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We live the mild and Rhett honey BBQ wings.  Get the bone in them (not boneless) they taste better.  I get extra sauce and my friend gets his crispy."}
{"text":"Pretty standard as far as BWW goes....we sat at the bar. The bartender was friendly, but the service was a bit slow. She was more interested in flirting with a guy at the bar than with serving us - but oh well. I certainly didn't come to BWW for a 5 star experience.  The food was good, the beer is cold.....it's near my house, so if I am craving wings again, we'll head back."}
{"text":"I am debating somewhere between a 2-3 star review.  Parking is difficult.  I've never sat in the actually dining room, I always head to the back bar.  The service is always friendly, and there are usually some sort of f/b specials going on.  My one  complaint is that the stools at the high tables are REALLY uncomfortable.  They need to have backs on  them, like the ones at the bar.  Also, the machines are super out of date. Feels l ike I am playing the first  video poker game ever created.  Plus side: there are a lot of tvs, so it's  easy to catch a glimpse  of whatever game you want.  Nothing on the menu is really spectacular, but the wings are generally pretty delicious and  served quickly."}
{"text":"Roach was crawling on wall by bar , showed manager & he was very unprofessional about it . Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Server was a straight bitch , didn't add my blazin rewards after I personally gave her my number my self , beer was hot with no taste , shitty customer service with attitude ! Ghetto bww i rather drive & waist gas to another buffalo wild wings then get treated this shitty !"}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports. The food is good and there are always drink specials. Last time we were there, we had a really great server, Christina. There is a lot of stimulation with all the TVs but that's why you go, right?"}
{"text":"Dirty trashed floors, sticky icky menus, both big screens have huge tears, and a completely inattentive waitstaff (except for Brian, who resembles Chris Rock and took care of our table even though it wasn't his area). For being in the middle of a major financial district and right next to an NFL stadium This place is quite sad. Whoever owns this particular BWW needs to pay attention to their operation. We won't return. Brian was the only redeeming factor at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of this place to begin with....but a friend wanted to go to watch the basketball finals. Got the nachos.....definitely no good. I also ordered a Tangier a and tonic....Also no good. If you decide to go here....stick with the wings. Otherwise....I recommend that you don't come here. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience I've ever had. I work in the food industry so I understand how things can get crazy in restaurants but there was no excuse for how terrible our visit was. We sat at our table for 15 minutes without any greeting from a server.. or anyone.. and we had to get up to get drinks from the bar to bring back to the table. After hunting down our server she then took 10 minutes to bring back our waters and to take the order. We only saw her twice after taking our order and 3 tables around us had their drinks, food and check brought to them before we even got our food. When we got the food the order was incorrect. We waited an hour and 15 minutes for 4 orders of chicken wings and one spinach dip. No refills, no check back from our server and we asked to see a manager several times and they never came to our table. I had to bus our own table by bringing empty glasses to the bar because our waitress(Mandy) was too busy wiping dirty tables. We were there for over 2 hours to get chicken wings and an appetizer. Horrible service, loud & dirty restaurant & mediocre food. No one from our group will ever done or recommend a Buffalo Wings Again."}
{"text":"Above average priced food that are slightly under average. I have to give creds to the service and tasty burger. Where this chain takes its first hit is its flagship product, the wings. Do not get the boneless wings. They are dry and just not good. The Bone-in wings are OK+. The wing dip sauces are pretty good. Plus one star for having funny Party Buffalo crown/hat. Ask for one if u are there. Minus another star for too cold AC. It's freezing in there. Not good for me who have an office job with an aggressive AC as well.  All in all :-) burgers are yummy and I'll prob be back for those. Think I'm over the wings though.  Yum."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and great drinks.  Also a good place to come and watch games."}
{"text":"Yeck.  A party of 5 from the office ventured here for lunch on somebody's whim.  Mistake.  It took them about 5 minutes to pull 2 tables together and seat us - and the place was 3/4 empty, even right at high noon.  You'd have thought we were a party of 20.  Then after we got seated, nobody waited on us for an eternity.  Finally a young waiter ventures by and asks if we've been helped yet.  It was clear we weren't \"his\" table but he went ahead and took our orders since we'd been neglected.  The food was slow to come out (again, despite the joint being mostly empty), and was ho-hum at best, worse than that to some in the group.  I had come sort of chicken finger concoction that was as forgettable as my last gas station burrito.  Don't bother.. sketchy service and forgettable food in a spot where there are tons of other better choices."}
{"text":"I went to the bar with my husband and 2 friends on sat night 7/8/17 after midnight( tech its consider Sunday) had the worst service ever! we had a bald guy bartender help us. who at first was ok. needs more training on how to greet customers.. we order our food they took a little while but we were all gambling on the machine spending money and had a few drink so we were  ok with it. I order a salad which had a hair in it. he took it back and brought me another.. then brought out the rest of our food but forgot an order.. when we asked him about it he tells us you didn't order it.( we did but he wasn't paying attention). we still didn't complain..through out this whole time we are still gambling and ordering drinks... when we ask for our check(2 separate ones) they each were $97  he had charged us for all of our drink minus like 4 drink 2 on each bill ....when we all had played together over $250. when we ask the bartender why weren't our drinks comp he said because we have to and lose $40 to comp a beer and $40 for one shot!!! If we WIN any money we have to pay for all of our drinks and nothing gets comped?????!!!!!!!! What!!! that is unheard of..we always go to the bar and play. we always get our drinks comp!!!!in that case we wouldn't have played and just paid for our drinks.  I know he made up his own rule to maybe go back and comp our drinks later and get the difference for himself. we have never not left a TIP for some one no matter how bad of service.My Husband and our friends are Food Servers for a Fine Dinning restaurant so we live of of our tips and know how important customer service is. We left without tipping him. He had an attitude the whole time. some of my other friends said, they have had a problem with the same bartender before...sorry but we will not be going back to this buffalo wild wings.."}
{"text":"Every single time I order from this location \"to go\" I never get everything I order! They sit there and show you your order before you leave but only open the boxes like an inch so you think everything is in there. I love getting all the way home to realize I didn't get any sauces or dips that are supposed to come with the order. I should have learned after the third time that they can't seem to get their s**t together for to go orders, but I keep giving them a chance. My bad. I'd rather drive farther for better service now."}
{"text":"This place is nice. The music is a little too loud, but the staff are friendly and the prices are good. The reason I'm giving it a c instead of an a or b is because my glass was dirty and it was kinda gross.  I'll come back again though and see if it gets any better. At least the atmosphere is fun!"}
{"text":"BWW (I wrote BBW before AND nobody told me! Lmao, I'm dying!) used to be my go-to spot on Tuesdays when my husband and I were doing keto and has been our go-to wing place for quite some time. I have to really be in the mood for wings but when I am, I always go for B-Dubs. I'd always be there ordering a small parmesan garlic wing and medium regular buffalo for my hubby. We'd order ahead of time and then seat ourselves in the bar on our lunch break and the servers and hosts were always personable and attentive. I love that if you order online you can request all drums or all flats since I only like drums and my husband only like flats. No complaints here, I'd definitely come back for another Wing Tuesday."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Arrived on a busy Saturday night and was told to wait by the entrance because they are not seating more people.  I would understand the need to wait if all the tables were taken,  but several tables were empty.  And we were eventually seated at a booth that has been empty for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"If you are going for lunch be prepared to wait. The servers are great but the kitchen is slow. So if your not in a hurry its fine. If you only have a hour for lunch avoid the place!"}
{"text":"Food ok, service was horrible. Six girls just chit chatting. They need a manager to get his location in order. Had to ask for water and our bill.   Worst BWW ever been too and will never return."}
{"text":"Had the 15 min lunch from here. I got the burger with fries. The burger was okay but the fries were cooked well and yummy. My boyfriend has nachos, cheese sticks, wings and onion rings (the platter). He liked the onion rings, cheese sticks and onion rings but wasn't really excited about the boneless wings although he said the flavour was good."}
{"text":"There's no need for me to go into detail about this place, you know what it is and you know what you're getting. But to the jacka$$ who told me that BWW has some of the best nachos in the city, please hold your arm out, wind it back, and slap yourself right in the face. You have lost all credibility and made me waste stomach space...jerk."}
{"text":"Everyone knows what Buffalo Wild Wings is  so there's not much to review that you already don't know except I haven't been here in years and I can see why. The food has gone completely downhill from what I remember. It's as though chains start off great and slowly just go downhill. The tv game for football is still good, but this place is only good for drinking and game watching. Outside of that, if you're hungry do yourself a favor and just go get Chipotle 30 ft away and then come back. I couldn't even finish my food here even if I was Roberto's drunk...that's bad."}
{"text":"Overpriced and noisy, but otherwise good.  I like places like this when I eat alone, but if I have someone with me, the evening becomes a loud-talk contest as we try to speak over the sound of the game that's on the magnificently oversized TVs scattered throughout the place.  The food is just okay.  It's nothing special.  Certainly not worth the prices they change."}
{"text":"never bad here.  the fried pickle chips are the best you will find.  the wings are cooked to perfection.  if you just want drums, they will do it for no upcharge.  even the blue cheese is better than normal."}
{"text":"I have only ordered Togo at this location since it's right next to my gym so after a good workout, I always crave some boneless wings. The two star I'm giving is for the food since every bww I have been to, the food is always good. My order always consist of some appetizer and boneless wings ( honey BBQ, Parmesan garlic, and or mango habanero). The Togo counter is not at all organized. I waited about ten minutes before getting help, when I got my food the order was done wrong so I walked back in, and wIted another ten minutes before someone acknowledges me. My box of wings was sitting sideways in the bag, the carrots and celery squished on bottom. I had to rearrange the entire bag so nothing would spill while on the drive home. For eighteen peices of boneless, i only got one small cup of ranch. Other then that, I got home and loved my food."}
{"text":"best selection of wings - boneless and regular. Super affordable beer and wide variety on tap. love it. Go say hi to Theresa at the bar!"}
{"text":"Of all the Bdub locations in the Madison area, this one overall has the best service I have experienced. The servers are usually courteous and efficient, not making one wait too long for drink refills or the check. Service is a bit uneven at most other locations in town.  I've rarely ever had a bad experience here, and being able to watch a game or two while dining is great.  Some friends and I recently sat in the dining area while watching the Big Ten Championship Game, and the service was a little slow but the food was excellent. I usually steer clear of the boneless wings at Bdubs because they are a bit too crunchy for my tastes, but all other items on the menu are solid. I am particularly fond of the mini corn dogs and street tacos. I usually get the big jack daddy burger or buffalo chicken sandwich for an entree, and those rarely disappoint."}
{"text":"Love wing Tuesday. Wish ranch wasn't extra cost but what are you going to do. My daughter wasn't happy that the tablets system wasn't working but that's life. Also got the veggie boat in order to get ranch."}
{"text":"Having recently relocated to AZ. I ventured out to Westgate Entertainment and figured I would get something to eat. Walked in and the place was Extremely Loud..  The Staff could not hear me ask for a menu, so i had to use American Sign Language. Tried to read the menu, but with the speakers up so loud I put it down and walked out."}
{"text":"Came with the bf for lunch! They now has the \"fast break\" 11am -2pm I believe food has to be out in 15 mins came out in 11 mins not to mention it was super fresh!  Aileen was our server, coming from a bartender/server she was spot on thank you!!"}
{"text":"The general manager of this location needs to take a really good look at her front end team. We walked in to an obviously busy evening with a party of two. We were immediately told that their kitchen was at least 45 minutes behind on their food orders by Michael. Honestly I didn't think that was an issue given that there were a ton of open tables and thought we could be seated, have a drink, watch a game while we waited for food. Instead, when asked how long the wait was for a table, Michael insisted he couldn't tell us because there were two parties ahead of us. Mind you, there were at least 10-15 tables and booths empty and clean.  One of the waitresses actually walked up and asked for people to be seated in her section. She eventually turned out to be our waitress Brieanna - who was the best part of our evening- extremely attentive and pleasant.  She did an amazing job at keeping drinks on the table and got our apps out in less than 10 minutes.   The reason I'm suggesting management intervention is the fact that the group at the front turned away AT LEAST 30-40 people offering that the wait was at least 1-2 hours at one point.  No offer to go to the bar for a drink while they waited, or anything. Dollars just walking out the door and no one at the front cares.   Keep in mind we were given an unknown timeframe and the person walking in behind us with a party of two was quoted 45 minutes. We were seated in approx 10-15 minutes. This is no where near 45. The amount of business that walked out the door due to the ineptness of Michael and his teammates should warrant question. The fact that they blatantly put down their kitchen staff (btw our food including entrees came out in less than 10 minutes as well), has revenue bleeding from this location.   Also, I truly came in here for the flatbread. They don't have it anymore. Miswrapped silverware - poor quality of food= Disappointed.   And finally, if that wasn't enough, apparently a customer had the same disgust and smeared what one can only say was a bodily function all over a bathroom stall in the women's room.   It is safe to say we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a BWW on the strip now. The place itself is nice with more than enough TV's to go around. Sat at the bar to get some Buzztime trivia in. I liked that they have the newer game consoles. The bartender was engaging, friendly, and accommodating. The food came out timely and was really good. I washed down my blazing sauced wings with a tall cold one before heading back out into the Vegas heat. Prices were typical for a place on the strip, but it's nice having this option over some of the other chains. I'll definitely be back to get my wings and trivia fix in."}
{"text":"Great customer service!!! Wings were alright but they got some crazy flavors for sauces and a poppin $4 happy hour menu."}
{"text":"I know it is a chain but a fryer should be a fryer anywhere.  I went to this location a couple months ago and the wings came out slimy and rubbery.  They must have been cooked okay because I didn't get sick.    So I went back this week and asked for the wings to be crispy.  Didn't happen.  They were drenched in sauce and rubbery again.    I don't think I can go back.  I'm probably not,  but I feel like I'm spinning the Wheel of Salmonella."}
{"text":"Decent wings but for a sports bar playing hip-hop and reggae on a Saturday night before a Leaf game is very annoying, I guess management is more concerned keeping their staff happy than ensuring a pleasant atmosphere for the paying customers! Looking for a new local Wing place!"}
{"text":"Good food, but it took so long to get my check that I almost dined and ditched on accident. I was waiting for so long it felt like I'd already paid! Service was good other than right at the end."}
{"text":"How the hell do I put in a togo order for a salad and forty wings and when I come to pick up they forgot my wings and made me wait a half hour. If I wanted to wait I'd come here and order in person."}
{"text":"Decent wings, I'm a fan of the chain so I knew what I wanted. But I felt that maybe because it was a busy Saturday night, the wings weren't evenly, or properly seasoned. Whatever the reason maybe, I wasn't too satisfied with the way they were prepared. But on a good night, their flavors are really delicious and worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have been to BW-3 or B-DUB's twice in the last 3 years.  The food was the typical chicken wings and sauces.  This is just a standard restaurant.  It is okay, but it is not a place I would call unique or distinct....at least for Mesa AZ."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere quick to grab something to eat and we arrived before the dinner rush.  I love the Asian Zing wings but I wish they had just a touch more heat.  I will make that happen on my next visit.  Service was swift but we had the usual wait for the wings and sliders we ordered. It's always great to watch the myriad televisions available so that we can keep up with all of the sporting news esp. in the NFL this week.  The little one ordered the mild wings but we had to send them back for plain wings because the mild had a wee too much heat for a 7-year old (lesson learned).  All in all, it was a good dinner and I look forward to returning for more wings!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  After we received our food, our waiter never came back to the table.  We had to ask another waiter to get us our bill.  No drink refills, no \"how is your food\", nothing.  Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I recently went to this location with a friend before we saw a movie and was extremely happy with my service. we sat in the bar area at a high top our waiter quickly greeted us and recommend their new drinks along with happy hour pricing. while he was getting our drinks a guest experience caption came over and introduced herself, she allowed us to taste the sauces which made picking what to order helpful. Food was served quick and tasty. my drink was never empty and server was extremely friendly. towards the end of the meal a manager came by the table asking about our experience and making sure everything was good. I will definitely be returning to this location especially to watch sports, plenty of tvs and very clean establishment."}
{"text":"One star. Danielle, the waitress, really needs to not be in a customer service position. This woman has zero people skills, talks far too much and listens far too little. Here are Danielle's greatest hits from this evening..  -She sits on an 8 year old's chair with him, to take our order. An 8 year old with social anxiety. What's wrong with you, lady? You don't do that.  -Asks us if we want the food to come out as it's ready, or if we want it all at the same time. We say all at the same time. It starts coming out as it's ready. We ask why, she explains that's how they do things. Then why give us an option? Does Buffalo Wild Wings drug test their employees? Then she insists we speak to a manager which was rather pointless, as he didn't seem at all concerned with his employees' lack of intellect. Okay, fine.  -My fiancé and I order a large traditional wings, with a mix of mango habanero and bbq sauce. What we get is 10 mango habanero wings and 10 bbq. One of those things that could have been avoided had Danielle spent less time talking and more time listening. The rest of the order was correct. But since we already experienced the manager's lack of interest in his employees' lack of intellect, we didn't say anything. What's the point?  -When we were paying, my fiancé wrote my phone number on the top of the receipt, so we can get the rewards points. My fiancé points out that my number is written in there. Danielle procedes to lecture my fiancé on how she should get her own number on the receipt because it's worth so many points. Danielle seems to have zero understanding of sharing. Yes, it's my number, but the points are for us. But that's neither here, nor there, do your job. And that's not part of it.   -Lastly, this human wasteland asks us if we'd like any to-go boxes. We tell her what we need, and she tells us she will bring us two big and two small, \"for shits and giggles\". At a table with a 7 year old and an 8 year old. I'm all for equal opportunity, but if you plan on employing someone from the trailer park, with no semblance of appropriateness or social skills, don't have them directly involved with the customer.   We love Buffalo Wild Wings, but any future visits won't be to this location."}
{"text":"Food just wasn't good at all. All three of us got the thursday special (.70) cent boneless wings and a few baskets of fries.  We waited over 40 mins. Mine were supposed to be honey bbq, and they tasted awful, as if they tossed them in something else and made a mistake and tired to put the correct sauce on them. My food was hot, while the other two orders were ice cold and hard. We complained, and got an extra order of 12 regular wings, for free. Even those were not good. Refills were minimal and service was crappy. Won't return, 40 bucks down the drain."}
{"text":"Another one bites the dust. Terrible service, terrible food, as usual. Never my idea to come here, as it was a friends choice, I unfortunately  proceeded to be in attendence. 20 mins for 3 sodas and a beer, knew then we were off to a bad start. We were sitting in the dining area to the right, where our waitress struggled with multiple large party tables seemingly alone. I popped up in the booth to note other servers and/or hosts meticulously filling up ketchup bottles and chatting on the other side of the resturant . If this server is struggling to get drinks out, why isn't management noticing and/or getting others in the resturant involved with helping? What a nightmare. Food was mediocre, mine was cold, and we asked the runner for ranch. He never returned, as I expected. Over 70 dollars (plus tip) down the drain, and we couldn't even get silverware out of anybody. Server was cold, looked beyond stressed and didn't really have a kind word or gesture the entire time.  Depressing place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I came there already 8 times  Great experience.  The only issue it's , more then 15 min whiting for the food..."}
{"text":"I came in here two nights ago on a Thursday to enjoy their good deal of Thursday night boneless wings. We were seated and our waiter did not come by for about 5 minutes. We were ready to order right away after ordering drinks, but the waiter left so quickly we didn't get a chance to do so. He came back and we ordered 15 boneless with 3 different flavors and a large side of fries to share.   The wings arrived and they were cold. Not just warm, but cold. Totally unenjoyable to eat cold wings. The fries were warm, but they were extremely salty. I'm not usually one to nit pick places, but these were hard to eat. Needless to say, I won't be coming back here unless there is a turn around on the quality of food."}
{"text":"Not the usual excellence I expected.  The sampler came with undercooked onion rings - either oil not hot enough or pulled too soon - very soft and oily.  The burgers can only be served medium well, robbing them of flavor and moisture.  The screaming nacho burgers only flavor was from the fresh jalapeños; otherwise unremarkable in any way.  The big jack was topped with the same undercooked and oily onion rings.  Overall, the only consistently good thing were the drafts.  Disappointing as they used to have decent food.  Better wings and burgers in town - seek them out."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick bite after work and was surprised to see how busy this place was on a Monday night. Started with pretzels with queso dip, fantastic, served hot and salty. Nice size to share or with 6 wings its a meal. Ordered 4 different types of wings each was a hit. Loved the choices of dry or wet, would love wet lemon pepper ( hint hint). Only down side is the price but for a treat after a MONDAY, worth it."}
{"text":"The host was really nice. I couldn't see his name on his shirt, but he was very helpful. Our server Emily was great! Very helpful and attentive!!!! The other server who's name we didn't get either was great as well! SHOUTOUT to the whole staff! You guys are all always great! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Waited 3 months to come back and had a much better experience. Thank you John and Sky!I Was seatted right away at 7pm and it was busy, John was our server and he did a great job ty. Had the Medeterranian salad this time and it was good, altho you'd think it would have feta on it instead of blue cheese, unless yea let's hope not! We were in and out a lil over an hour and for a tiring Monday, service and staff was awesome along with dinner on them. Definitely left a better taste in our mouths this time and will be back to try again.  Thank you for making it a more enjoyable time!"}
{"text":"Long time lover of Buffalo Wild Wings. Dined in here half dozen times and it's always great. I often pickup food from here as well and enjoy your potato wedges.  The problem is that your restaurant and maybe Bdubs as a whole doesn't use warmers. This makes fries and wing breading rather distasteful and soggy. I will likely avoid pickup in the future which will lead to less visits to your establishment."}
{"text":"The only time I have ever been to this BWW is to order To Go, until now. Sadly I wish it stayed that way. I have always love the To Go service, but sadly (as I live and breathe) I am sitting at this bar still unattended.  My boyfriend and I got out of a concert and wanted wings. BWW was closer to us at this location than our home and since starvation was creeping upon us we chose this location. Horrible choice. I guess we are sitting in the middle of a shift change because we have been here more than 20 minutes and only have beers. It's obvious we want and need food.  LOCALS BEWARE: This BWW is also consistently extremely crowded due to the close proximity to the south of The Strip timeshare properties and hotels.   My wings finally came! Did I order these plain?!?!?! Where is my sauce?!?! OVER IT! Never again!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Dubs. The service is always friendly and fast and the food is always good. I don't stray far from wings, but they are fresh and cooked to order and they never skimp on the sauce. It's very close to my boyfriend's home and open 24 hours a day, so very convenient for our completely opposite Vegas working schedules. We can meet late night for a bite and our favorite beers. It's pretty straight forward. It's your run of the mill BDubs, nothing extraordinary to write home about, BUT they are consistently good."}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing! I can't remember our servers name but he was a guy and he was funny and very attentive to us. We really enjoyed this location! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Although this is my favorite wing place, this location has got to be the worst. The parking lot is jammed packed and has tight spaces. This location is small and very dark inside. No music no friendly people kinda freaky. I recommend going to the one on Craig Road."}
{"text":"Decent selection of beers on tap, including Rogue Dead Guy Ale, there are some late evening happy hour prices on drafts too, if I remember correctly.  The surroundings are nice, very spacious.  We had 4 people and ordered 50 wings (grilled) which turned out to be a pretty good deal.  They let us mix and match 4 different sauces too, so that was cool.   Friends of mine told me that the wings here sucked, but I enjoyed them.  The service was good, no complaints.  Karaoke starts at 10pm Friday nights."}
{"text":"First time here at Bdubs, thought it would be pleasant but turned out to be the opposite. The seat are that they placed us was too crowded for a party of 4 while the party of 2 got placed in a more opened area. The server kept trying to rush our order and looked confused each time he came around our table. We got the sampler appetizer, which was pretty decent but we didn't receive any silver ware or plate, so we only had napkins and the table got really messy.   My friend and I decided to get the same thing, the Honey Buffalo Chicken Ranch Salad. We were super excited for it. When it came out and we started eating it, the chicken was ice cold! Kind of like when you take a few frozen veg, stick it in the microwave for like 1 minute and it's still icy. Yeah, I know it's a salad but this was the first time I have ever had a chicken salad at a restaurant with icy cold chicken, besides getting a chicken salad (with mayo) on bread.   I was looking forward to some hot honey BBQ chicken on a bed of lettuce with cheese and tomatoes...I asked the server if this was how the chicken was supposed to be and  why (basically stating my displeasure). He told me that they cook the chicken fresh and chill it down every morning  and that most people complain having a hot fresh grill chicken on their salad. I don't know about you Mr. but the chicken looked like that resealable Tyson grilled chicken cubed and tasted like it was stuck behind the pantry freezer. Totally wouldn't come back here for a long time.  Sincerely,   Cintya P."}
{"text":"My family and I had lunch here and we ordered the mini corn dogs for my kiddo, hubby had medium chicken fingers, and I had mild and garlic wings. The food was good, but I wish I would have ordered chicken fingers, I wasn't a fan of the slimy wing skin. However, I must highlight our amazing server Melissa. She is so welcoming and attentive. She made our experience wonderful and was so nice to my little one and made sure we always had drinks. She really goes above and beyond  and I noticed other patrons asking for her too. If you visit BWWs I recommend asking to be seated in Melissa's area"}
{"text":"The service and ticket times at this BWW are horrendous. Every time I've eaten here, I've had to wait 45-60 minutes for an order of wings. A restaurant that claims to specialize in wings should not take so long. Servers do not check in often enough. If you're going to eat here, make sure it's not during popular restaurant hours and make sure you eat downstairs. Service is OK downstairs, but still nothing special."}
{"text":"I came in to get the wings that were on special. I asked the server, \"wings are half off tonight, right?\" He replied: \"yes.\" I looked at the menu and ordered the medium size. I ordered three different flavors. He asked \"traditional right?\" Assuming those were the ones on sale tonight I said yes. My bill came out to $16 for the wings and I had to ask why they weren't half off. Come to find out it's boneless wing night. Like come on man, I clearly only came in for the special.   I come here to this location for lunch maybe once or twice a month. After tonight, I'm not coming back. I always leave with a stomachache asking myself why I eat fried chicken that isn't even cooked all the way through.  Oh yeah, I know why I come back, the special. The way I see it, Buffalo wild wings owes me one, and until they make it right, I'm no longer going to be a customer. The funny thing is I would've much rather of had the boneless wings."}
{"text":"The only thing that bums me out is that they don't offer delivery...Either directly or through delivery services like Door Dash and Skip The Dishes. Do you have any idea how much money you would make off me alone if there was delivery involved?! Let's just say a lot. But anyway! Wings are always good, they obviously have very definitive rules about preparing them, as there's never any bad surprises (like old rubbery chicken. Been there, done that. Not pleasant.) I love the selections of sauces and beer. The dessert menu could use some work but that's not really what people come there for I guess. Overall, it hits the spot when you're craving wings! :)"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is a pretty decent spot. Came here with my friends last Sunday and it's alright. There were no complaints about the food. Service was quick (Sunday afternoon, pretty much dead). Nice/clean bathrooms. Their new barbecue chicken sandwich is awesome and I'd get it again - the fries are a little too thin for me and feel more like I'm getting hickory sticks than anything else but overall it's a good experience. I think there are far superior restaurants out there but it's not like Buffalo Wild Wings is a bad option. Our waiter was friendly and attentive and there are a ton of TVs and it's a great sports atmosphere if you need a place to catch a game or something. You could definitely do worse.  + Friendly and efficient service + Clean washrooms + Good food - nice big portions (just don't like the fries that much) + Nice atmosphere  No glaring cons."}
{"text":"Just walked out of Buffalo wild wings there were 6 customers at the bar the person greeted me at the door and that was the only service I received. You really need bartenders who will at least smile and acknowledge you are there. When I got up to walk out she told me she'd be right with me. Don't plan on coming back here any more."}
{"text":"If I could put ZERO stars I would. I normally go here because i really enjoy the flavor Asian Zing and it's very close to my house. However, on our most recent visit, the service was INCOMPETENT. Our server was a pregnant woman, and I do not have a problem with pregnant waitresses. She greeted us, took our orders and gave us our waters, and then we never saw or talked to her again. We ordered chips and salsa, which given the current occupancy of the restaurant, you'd expect to come out within ten minutes or so. More so, as we continued to wait for our appetizer, we noticed our waitress a few tables in front of us talking to two men who appeared to be her friends. As she engaged with these two, talking, using each other's phones, and even holding and playing with their baby, we continued to get more impatient: being that we hadn't received our appetizer after 20 minutes and we haven't heard from our server who was apparently too busy with personal matters. Shortly after the 20 minute mark, our food came out: which isn't bad. We turned our concerns regarding our appetizer to the food runner and proceeded to cancel the order. Still no word from our server. It wasn't until after we finish our food that we had any contact with our server whatsoever. This contact took form as our waiter casually walking by our table and placing the bill down without saying a word to us. The food was good, but remaining frustrated about the absence of our relatively simple appetizer and overall lack of customer service, we left promptly.   Our main concern with the visit is that we were genuinely neglected. Our server was only a few feet in front of us engaging with her friends as we sat by and patiently stared and waited on her. We would understand if the restaurant was busy: it wasn't, there were maybe 4 other parties. We would understand if she was the only server: she wasn't, there was at least two other. We would understand if she was genuinely busy: she wasn't, she was in front of us the entire time.   Overall, we love the food here and really do prefer this location but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in late for wings.  The place was mostly empty but still had a nice atmosphere.  I got the traditional and boneless wing combo with the buffalo chips.  Asian zing and Parmesan garlic.  It's my favorite and I was not disappointed.  Our waitress was friendly and prompt with everything but the bill -- but we probably looked like we were just having a nice chat so I can't blame her for not bringing it sooner. I will of course be back!"}
{"text":"i should it know when i ask what was the waiting time and the lil cholita with the cowboy jersey told me that they cant give me a time because people was hanging out watching the game. we was a group of 7 one in a wheelchair ( they give 0 f*** ) and put us in the patio. i ask 3 different person if they could turn on the fire place and they all gave me a different story. we order and i ask if they could change the fried pickles for something else in the new allstar sampler, i was told the manager doesnt allow them to change any items. food came in and 3 different persons came to bring us the food and my wife order was mess up and mine was missing.  we order some ranch and some blue cheese they bring all blue cheese, when my order came they didnt put extras sauce how i ask them to. my wife wings was the ones with extra sauce when she didnt ask for it. our ranch and blue cheese where half full this is the only bww where i got half porsions of sauce.  the only good thing was johandra the lady who took our order she is very good and she always came to the table to see if we needed something. other than that manager doesnt know how to run a restaurant with a high volume of clients and the cooks should be replace ( if you dont know how to read and follow instructions or dont have the pasion about your job do everybody a favor and find another job ). i will be sending and email to corporate. if i could give -10 stars i will. stay away from this location.   ps. they didnt have some beers we ask for"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with BWW food. The service in the bar area after 10pm is awful and slow. The bartenders pretend they don't see you and don't make eye contact. It took a solid five minutes before we were greeted and asked for our drink order. The bartender never checked on us after she have us our drinks. We had to get her attention to order food and get another round of drinks. Very disappointing since it's the BWW around, will definitely go to Millers Ale house across the street at night, because of the lack of service."}
{"text":"Hostess was unorganized and too busy cleaning tables. while 3 other employees were just talking among themselves by the podium and didn't acknowledge anybody. new customers are standing around without being greeted or listed on the waiting list.  By the time we sat down and ordered our drinks. Waitress came back and said they ran out of pineapple juice at 4pm??"}
{"text":"I ate here on the most previous BOGO offering. The seating, take out, and food was backed up 45 minutes. While waiting 45 minutes to be seated, I fainted from standing up and waiting so long. When I fainted, I was lucky to have 2 friends near to help because the hostesses could not have cared less. My friends told them I needed water and all they did was walk me over water about 2 minutes later. 2 minutes? I could be in ill condition. Needless to say NOBODY asked me if I needed medical attention or an ambulance. I fainted clear as day right in front of their hostess stand and nobody cared. If the health of your own customers on your restaurant floor is not enough for your staff to care than you need to fire your hostesses and gain employees who care about human decency. I have never fainted before so I don't know what the protocol is. But I do know one thing for sure, the health and decency of all humans (workers or non workers) entering your business should always be a first priority. Please, retrain your staff on what to do if a person is in need of medical attention. Luckily, water was enough to get me back going, but you should ALWAYS ask if they need medical attention. PS after waiting I did get my BOGO which was awful quality wings and our server, Allison, was more concerned with closing out her shift than helping us have quality service. Needless to say I will not return back here ever."}
{"text":"Great place to watch multiple games and eat lots of wings! The screaming nacho burger is awesome and is my go to when ever I go there. When you go here make sure you ask for Ciera. She is always nice and very attentive and gives good menu recommendations if your with someone that can't decide what they want!"}
{"text":"Kids had a birthday around the corner so I stopped in for a quick pint and some wings.  Sat at the bar and was served immediately and professionally by an experienced bar tender who paid just enough attention without being overbearing.  My first choice of beer was out (Rickard's Red) but Moosehead was available.l so I went with that.  As I like spicy but savory flavors I went with a order of Spicy Garlic, which is about the same heat as Buffalo classic. Thought they were slightly over sauced but wings were big and delicious, and hell this is finger food anyway so I'm OK with getting messy.  No trouble finding three sports to watch at the bar and would've had a good view of screens from most of the dining area had I been there instead.  Looking for another kids birthday party in the area as an excuse to pop back in!"}
{"text":"Sports, wings, beer. Not much more.needs to be said. Loads of TVs to choose from, plenty of seating, the Meadowvale location has the same friendly staff I've come to expect at other BWW's.  Busy parking lot as it's in one of those huge strip plazas."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a zero I would. First off it was so loud you could not hear yourself think. Next the food wasn't fixed the way we requested and it tasted awful. I don't know what seasoning they use, but the burger and fries were unedible. And to top it off our server did not once bring us a refill on drinks, she was to busy talking to another table, dancing and just goofing off.  $43.00 for 3 sandwiches, fries and drinks, a meal you could get at Mcdonalds a lot cheaper and it would actually be edible. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE experience especially after hearing this was suppose to be a good place to eat. Never will I give my business to them again!"}
{"text":"Needed to get out of the house Saturday afternoon.  Mild case of cabin fever after the big snow event over the last few days.    This is a very new location near Northlake Mall and I had yet to try it so away I went.  Stopped in for a few beers, wings, and a basketball game on TV.  NC was playing so the place was pretty busy.     Typical BWW in every way which is to say solid but nothing award winning.  Wings were tasty, beer was cold, service at the bar was fine.  I had experience I wanted and expected so A-OK."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I come to this location often & usually receive good service when dining in . Today we came in just to pick . EVERYONE  was just standing around , only one register at the take out check out . Several ladies behind the counter tho ??? Which frustrated me so much , one young lady dismissed us due to her not having cash in the register . Again didn't make any sense . BUT then we were greeted by Brittany ! Such a sweet girl , literally doing all the work solo , while others stand around & talk to one another . She was answering the phone alone ! While AGAIN everyone watched !! She's a SUPER hard worker !!! LOVE HER ! If it wasn't for her & the experience we had with her ! I would never come back !! Shout out to my girl Brittany !!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could put zero stars I would. If you wanna get your food in an hour, and get rude service from your waiter then this is the perfect spot for you. I used to love this spot, but for the last 5 times I've been here, my food, my service, or just the vibe is off in this spot."}
{"text":"The beer is the only consistent thing about this place at least that is cold! Last time I was in with the lady friend and we were left to ourselves for the first thirty minutes. Being reasonable we asked another server to take our table over although we didn't move sections! We were talking to other people in the previous waitress's section and she came up to us around the end of the Patriots game and was saying thank you for talking to her table... I thought his was strange. The quality of food has seemed to be the same that is what is salvaging rating overall it's really hit or miss so if you are expecting the same quality of service every time you should go to Twin Peaks"}
{"text":"Today at 1:45, my boyfriend and I decided to go. The food was okay but the service not so much. We got there at 1:50, lunch specials end at 2. We stood there for about 5 minutes before being sat. The host person was on the phone taking an order and said she would be with is in a few minutes. A server came over and asked if it was just us and said it's going to be a wait because he's cleaning the table. I said it was fine as long as we get our order in before the lunch special ends. He looked at the clock and it's 1:55, he said if the computer will let him he will. I was really not happy because if the computer will let him what??? Ummm not. I told him it better let him because we have been waiting to be sat and we were here before the end of the special. The server walked away and the host sat us. We got sat in the same servers spot and submitted our order. The meal went okay until we needed refills. Waited 10 minutes before I got frustrated and asked the host girl if she could get our drinks. She said ok but walked away and never got them. I seen her tell the server a few moments later. The server came over and asked if we would like a box. Of course I said no I just wanted a refill of my drink. He walked away came back with a tray full of drinks and asked what I was drinking again. So I told him. Finally 15 minutes later I'm not thirsty anymore.  I tell you. To not check on ur tables within 15-20 minutes or at least walk by not very good service. Hopefully I don't get him again."}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight to get some dinner. I ordered a medium order of wings and mini corn dogs Togo. My over all experience was okay. Food was very good for being Togo. Wings were warm and cooked perfectly. The mini corn dogs were cold by time I got them home but to be fair I do like 7 miles away and had to make a second stop. The mini corn dogs were still tasty.  The service from the Togo waitress was good. Nothing special about the service she provided.  They would of been 5 star if it wasn't for the host people. Every time I go in there I feel they can't keep themselves very busy. I walked in and she gave me a very blank stare. When I said I'm getting Togo she just said \"oh ok\". After I placed my order I went outside to sit for 5 minutes. When I came back in she had her back towards the door bent over talking with the other host person. So after I sat there for 10 minutes she turned around and said \"are u waiting for someone before I seat you\". I said I was just waiting for Togo. As I observed her for a few minutes she kind of looked like she was high. Very slow moving messy hair confused by what any other person was saying to her.  A manager came over and started helping sit all the people waiting because she seemed so confused.  I enjoyed the food and will be back soon even though they do not have very hardworking host people."}
{"text":"Okay experience but they should really have a manager on duty at night. Tried to use my 5 dollars off coupon for doing the survey and They were unable to give it because he doesn't have a manager. Well the only time I go is graveyard. So bww get a manager or give graveyard authority to take the coupon off!!!  Other than that food is good and service is ok."}
{"text":"Pretty great happy hour! Lots of tv's with numerous games/events on. A little surprised the the Yankees game was on one of the smaller ones but.....  The staff seemed to work well as a team. Food was pretty good. Great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"We were in town so we wanted some wings. Happy that there was a BWW by the strip. We ate at the resturant, kinda disappointed that there choice of beer was little compared to the one we have in Cali. Its only reason why I gave it a 4 star but anything else like the service was great."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of frequenting chain restaurants, but sometimes the lunch hour calls for sacrifice. Stopped in for a quick bite to eat while in the area. The staff was extremely friendly and seemed eager to make sure we had everything we needed.   I opted for something off of the 'Fast Break' lunch menu. The timer is an interesting take on food service, and makes me a little fearful for how they do things so quickly. That being said, they had my food to me within 7 minutes. I got a pulled pork sandwich and potato wedges. It was good but not out of this world. What more can you expect for something made in 7 minutes? Good stop if you need a quick bite for lunch."}
{"text":"Oh yeah....THIS is what you call some good ass chicken wings.  I'm not normally a chicken wing person, but I can eat a dozen of these crispy little suckers.  AND, their potato wedges are so good.  They're the perfect size, just enough crispiness, and perfectly seasoned.  mm mm good.  What I like to do is get the wings dry, and get my sauces on the side.  They have like 20 different sauces, and all presented on the menu on an increasing spicy scale.  LOVE IT.  I loooove the parmesan garlic, asian zing, and the WILD.  Go on Tuesdays, and the wings are 45 cents each.    Definitely a place to stop by even when staying on the strip."}
{"text":"Been here in Los Angeles, so nothing more special than the rest.   We went here out of convenience and the fact my niece had never been.  The drinks were good and the wings were the same as any other location.   I really the consistency at this chain.  You never have a surprise with the taste of the wings.  The place is called Wild WINGS, so wings should be what your order.  We went out on a limb and ordered the mac and cheese. Not an adventure anyone else should take.  Just stick to the fries as a side, otherwise you might be disapointed as we were.    This location gets a 3 star mostly because of the service.  Yes, it was REALLY that bad.  The drinks were soooo good, but you can't make a refill come out of the sky.  A waitress needs to actually SERVE you."}
{"text":"Another eatery that aspires to be a dive bar.  The food quality is kept on par with the staffs pay.  Nobody cares... including the customers.  But hey, that's what the business model is built around.  \"How is everything?  Great!  Can i get you anything else?   I'll take a another order of wings and a light beer\".  Not much can go wrong with fried chicken wings.  So we can check that off.  Water in a glass or light beer?  Yep.  We can check that off.  Napkins? Check.  Here comes the stumper... celery, carrots, and dip?  Check.  Oh Wait! -pause- Just the carrots with blue cheese.    Dressing are out of a giant bottle.  Nothing has any genuine flavor but the grease.  Service is Sllllooooowwwww.  So forget about getting in and out in under an hour.  No need to tip well since staff rotates so quickly.   Carpets are worn and tired.  Something just creepy about carpets in a restaurant.  Tables wobble.  This is the kind of place where the help deep-fries your food in the prior nights pissing match over the fryer."}
{"text":"Just tried to order food over the phone and I was on hold for 30 minutes. I asked if we can get free food or any compensation since that was a very long time before we could order and the employee informed me that there were no managers to approve this. This honestly was really upsetting because we were already on hold for so long. In addition, no military discount could be applied, again, because a manager was not there to consent. WTF? That was RIDICULOUS. The person taking my order over the phone was informing me that they were busy so that's not on them, I totally understand, but 30 minutes? Y'all need to hire more employees or something. So this is to management and not the employee that took my order. You need to have a manager on duty. This was just preposterous. Only giving one star because of the food."}
{"text":"Went in almost EVERY Sunday. Football, beers and fantastic wings.  We love Buffalo Wild Wings no matter where we go (and trust me, I am not a franchise fan AT ALL), but this one has the great food consistency and, even better, a fantastic crew working there. We always sit at the bar, with at least 2 projection screens on EACH wall. So much to look at, and a perfect circle bar in the middle.   We sit there for the comfort, easy football watching, quick drinks, and the bartenders. Sorry to the rest of them, but we always wait for BRIAN to serve us. He is quick (with the drinks/food and his wit) and very easy to talk with. He became our favorite pretty quickly. Its great when you have someone at your favorite place to grab wings that you can go to every time, and its GREAT 100% of your visits.  The video poker/black jack on the counter tops are pretty great too. As long as you put in at least $10 into the machine, you get a free drink. Thank you BWW!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow & unfriendly service, long wait for cold food."}
{"text":"There are a few good things about BWW.  First, the mango habanero sauce is great.  Second, I like playing the trivia game.  Lastly, the beer is reasonably priced and cold.  On the down side, the wings are so small that there has to be a law against killing chickens that young.  The service is hit and miss.  3 out of 4 times the service is fine, but if you get a bad one, it is really bad."}
{"text":"Good food good service very fair prices.   Not the most healthy but overall very very good"}
{"text":"I read a lot of the reviews here usually when I'm bored and as a Waiter and frequent costumer of most restaurants in this valley, I get both sides. Olivia and Christopher who I've known a few years back as a teenager, they are literally the best servers you can ask for. They stay on top of everything, if they can't greet you within a 60 second period they'll let you know so you don't just sit their like... \"Is anybody gonna come say hello?\", plus they're fun to talk to. I like the different wing flavors. Their are 16, such as Mild, medium, sweet BBQ, honey BBQ, carribean jerk, Parmesan garlic, Asian Zing, honey mustard, thai curry, spicy garlic, hot, jammin jalapeno, BBQ hot, wild, mango habenero, blazin lol Any problems, manager Melissa is always ready to fix things, and so is the general manager. The newer staff could be a bit more considerate and nicer to the guest. I know the restaurant industry can be a bit annoying but you have to be nice, costumers are the ones who pay and tip servers and bartenders, trust me, I had a table that literally did everything to annoy and inconvenience me but that $200 tip was worth the smiles and \"you got it\" attitude so I do think the attitudes should be changed a bit, but other than that I love it. They also have a better selection of drinks than where I work at which is literally 10 feet away.... (Yeah)  oh and if you order French fries, please get them with cheese (I like american and queso) and bacon, and sour cream on the side (yes that's extra, not free add ons) ... And please bring the buffalo chicken flatbread back. I really do miss it!!!"}
{"text":"What a dump!! I only went there because we were with some friends who wanted to go there real bad(???). My Mi Tai came in with virtually no alcohol!! Is there such thing as no alcohol Mi Tai?? Never heard of it... Cheapoooos! That's all I can say. I ordered chicken wrap to be on a safe side, specifically asking them NOT to make it spicy, because I am not a spice kinda gal. It came so spicy that I had to sip water constantly with every bit of food, otherwise I would probably burn my throat and intestines... I never drink water while I eat, because it's not healthy, plus I can't taste my food at all that way. I probably should have sent it back. But we were there with friends and I didn't want to make a scene.. My husband ordered a burger. Well, that was somewhat eatable. Our friends ordered those buffalo wings. I've tried one just to get distracted from the fire in my mouth. That was the worst deep fried piece of garbage I've ever tasted! I am surprised this place stays in business at all! There are a lot of junk food joints in the area, I bet all of them are better than this! Go to Zipps. It's noisy as hell and lots of screaming kids, but at least they have decent food! Is there such thing as giving O points in the review??"}
{"text":"Our Server Wasn't The Best & I Get It, It Was Busy But When He Finally Showed Up He Was Kinda Rude & Ignoring Us We Ha To Repeat Ourselves Several Times. When Our Food Came Out Of Course IT WAS WRONG!  Maddison Brought Out Out Food & When We Told Her It Was Wrong He Was Right Behind Her!! He Heard That Our Order Was Wrong But He Just Walked Away. Maddison The Runner Was Great Super Kind & Polite Fixed Our Order Right Away & Kept Coming Back To Make Sure We Were Okay. Which Is Not Her Job But She Could Tell We Were Frustrated With Our Server... So Thank You So Much To Going Out Of Your Way To Help Assist Us I Know You Has A lot Going On."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here almost every Thursday for the cheap. 75 cent boneless wings. The servers r very pleasent and the food is great. It's also a great place to cafch ur favorites sports team on so many of their large tv"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 1 star because they charged me $0.60 for a cup of ranch. I complained on their website and the manager called and stated they charged me for the ranch because I went on a Tuesday and the wings at $0.70 each. So basically I feel they are trying to recoup their money by charging for ranch. Also the manager that called me was extremely rude. I've never had to pay for ranch in the 15 years I've been eating at their establishments. I don't care about the 60 cents it's the point. Ranch is a condiment. Are they going to start charging for ketchup and mustard also."}
{"text":"Group of 5 and my wife wanted Taco Bell instead. We were planning on 4 of us eating Buffalo Wild Wings but the guy asked us to leave because we couldn't bring food from another place! He said to leave the food outside, so we just left instead. Can't believe you rather lose the transaction than allowing one person out of 5 to eat her food with us. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"We hit up BWW at least once a week, sometimes two.  Service is usually a B or better - apparently the hosts have been instructed to save certain tables for \"bigger\" parties and won't separate them into smaller tables (we usually come with 3), so sometimes we have to wait while larger parties that arrived later are seated before us.  It is always pretty busy, and the food typically takes a bit to arrive.  We have come to expect this much and have dealt with it over the years we have been coming.  However, last night - wow.  We were crammed into a small 4-top table between two much larger parties, one of which included a person with a  DRUM.  I'm not talking a child's drum, I'm talking about a decorative, working, adult drum, that the customer then allowed his apparent grandchildren (1-ish and 5-ish) to beat on throughout our dinner.  We were less than 3 feet from this circus.  We mentioned right away to our server that if the party was not leaving, the noise was going to be a problem.  It took a good 20 minutes for her to say anything to the shift manager, and then another 10 minutes for the \"general manager\" (who is NOT the general manager) to come out to ask us about it.  Needless to say, it was a much less than pleasant dinner.  About 80% of the way through our meal, we finally received an offer to relocate us to another table, and they offered to comp us a dessert.  We were told that BWW is a \"family friendly\" restaurant, so they couldn't say anything about the drum.  So, this is great news.  From now on, when we go in, we'll be taking my kid's trumpet.  Might as well have him practice while we eat as a family.  Thanks, BWW!"}
{"text":"I like BW3 in general, but this location is DA BEST!  Been coming here ever since they opened (6-7 years ago?) because our house is just around the corner, and it's always been a great experience.  So no, their food isn't French Laundry, it's just wings and other bar foods.  But I'm going to give it 5-stars based on one thing - the Mango Habanero wings!  I've had this at other BW3s before, but they're not 5-star-worthy.  This one is.  Mango-y but not too sweet, big time habanero that is fiery hot and does justice to this sauce being the 3rd hottest out of the 1000 sauces they have.  I'm just scared for #1 & 2...  The other sauces are also great (maybe not 5-star worthy), and their burgers are really good as well which was a pleasant surprise.  Service is great all-around, especially the pretty sweetheart at front.  And this place is just hopping all the time with great vibe and lots of TVs.  Just such a fun place, if you can get a seat!  So 4-star value on the food except the 5-star Mango Habanero, at least 4-star service and a can't-fail 5-star enjoyment all rolled into a place walking distance from the house.  How can you go wrong?  Table-for-1 Factor:  So there is a downside, you probably can't enjoy all this if you're alone unless you're willing to take a chance on walking in by yourself.  Awkward..."}
{"text":"Too bad no stars isn't an option.  Worst service of all time every single time I've had to rely on them.  You're making a big mistake walking in.  Avoid avoid avoid.   Unless you like to sit and wait with your ice getting dry."}
{"text":"A couple bartenders expressed their surprise that  I came back after my poor review. My response .... the beer is still cold. The appetizers for happy hour are consistent enough. Have you changed your policy of staging your wings since my review? You should consider serving hot and fresh food made to order as a standard. The bartenders were professional and attentive today even after mentioning they read my last poor review. She asked if I changed my opinion. I said no, but that I forgave easily."}
{"text":"My favorite BWW!! I only come here for graveyard when Drew is there! Late Night Happy Hour! Peaceful, nobody bothers me! Great Service. Great food! Come see Drew!!"}
{"text":"GOOD LUCK, AND GOOD NIGHT.  I've been to a lot of BW3s before and sure it's an average chain restaurant, but wow does this location have some serious issues.  I hate writing bad reviews, I really try to only review places I like (which there are plenty of), but tonight on yelp I'm slamming down a second bad review and this place takes the cake.  I've been here probably 4-5 times, and the last 2 visits were just ridiculous.  The first time was for my fantasy football league.  The service was atrociously slow, with us waiting 20 minutes inbetween every waitress visit and 45 minutes for our \"wings\", the wireless connection was dropping constantly throughout the draft, they sat us right next to another fantasy league and both leagues could barely hear what anyone was saying, and the food was . . . well typical BW3s food which is to say not that great but fills your stomach I guess.  At the end of the draft, all of us vowed never to have it there again.  My last visit was probably one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had aside from maybe someone \"doing something\" to the food.  We had a pretty big group; about 15 people, and were all meeting up to watch some playoff football games.  Our group was coming in sporadically over the course of about an hour, but I'd say about half of us put our food order in around the same time.  The waitress was an older lady and I could already tell by how slow the drink refills were coming to not expect much.  Shoot ahead a little bit and we're waiting a LONG time for our food.  Normally, I wouldn't care at a place like this on a day like this because we're watching football and laughing and all that good stuff.  But this was crazytown long wait.  The two friends of mine who showed up last (about 30-40 minutes after us) got their food before the rest of our group!  So at that point we knew something was up, we talk to our waitress when she finally comes back 15 minutes later, and she goes back \"to check\".  Another 15 minutes go by.  She is walking around helping other customers, trays of food are going out to every table but ours, and finally she comes over when we flag her.  She tells us she made a mistake and didn't punch in our orders but she's now taken care of it and the food should be out soon.  Another 30 minutes + go by.  I'm not joking.  She's come by maybe once to refill drinks and let us know casually that the food should be out soon.  Most of the time we see her walking around like we don't exist.  We flag her down and ask what's going on with the food.  She tells us she'll check.  15 minutes go by.  Finally, food comes out.  She doesn't know who's food goes where, and half the orders are missing.  We ordered stuff to go with our wings, it's not here.  She goes back and tells us it should be out soon.  20 minutes go by.  Finally, we get the rest.  Hell, it took us like 15 minutes to get DIPPING SAUCE that was supposed to come with our wings let alone the rest of the food.  Nary an apology or sign of sincerity.  I go over and talk to the manager and he immediately seems to be on the up-and-up about the situation.  He seems distraught and genuine, and says he'll take $50 off the food and hands me a stack of $5 off coupons.    We're watching the game waiting for our checks.  Another 30 minutes go by.  I'm not making this stuff up folks.  Bills finally come out, comps are on it, food is all with the wrong people, we send the waitress back to get it figured out after we all write down for her what we all had.  15 minutes later, we get new bills, it's *mostly fixed but there are now no $$ comps like the manager said.  So we all throw in 2 of our $5 coupons.  20-30 minutes later we're finally able to pay as most of us are yawning and wondering if we're going to have to pitch a tent.  I was on the verge of a dine and ditch; something I'd never consider.  On the way out a few of the girls go talk to the manager again, and then relate that he was upset when he saw that we used the coupons and explained that the bill was correct even though 15 people saw that it was clearly wrong with full prices and no comps.   It turns out it was the waitresses third day, half of me felt bad, the other half was still disappointed that she didn't handle the situation better.  She didn't even make an attempt to be apologetic or act like she cared.  I only gave them any stars because they have big tvs, beer, and space.  I'm being generous.   We got there at 5:15pm.  We left at 9:30pm.  DO.  NOT.  GO. HERE."}
{"text":"This is usually my go to spot for some amazing wings. But our server not that so amazing. She came by twice but never brought us refill and when we asked for a tray for our used wing but never did.  And she disappeared the whole time not once did we see her. So we had to ask a manager for our check and box. I get that this place is always busy. But to be a great server and to get a great tip it's always best to think about your customers. Even if they give you a hard time. I usually don't complain. But I don't like to act like I'm a nobody when I'm here to spend my money."}
{"text":"This place is extremely horrible and their service simply sucks.  I had such a bad experience today at this location.  The staff is extremely rude and their service is very bad.  i would not recommend anyone to go to this location.  I had to wait for 45-50 mins for my order and then if I needed more stuff, i had to wait for another 40 mins.  i would not recommend anyone to goto this place.  Their stuff do not care about remediating the issue but instead care if they get tipped on top of this horrible service and if you do not tip they get pissed off at you and show attitude.  I didn't see the manager even after i was complaining at the front.  I don't understand how in the hell are they running this place.  I had very good experience at mississauga location and came here with my family thinking it was a good place to eat but I will not visit this place ever again!!"}
{"text":"So... where do I start?  Came here 2 nights ago... with a bunch of guys of course. They all had beers... me on the other hand... well I don't drink... which leads to me to review on the food and service.  I ordered one of their wraps... it took over 30 mins to arrive after placing my order. Why did it take that long to get to me? My friends said they messed up on my order... oh and the worst part after the long wait... It didn't have any flavor and the taste was horrible! I had wedges with my wrap... and that was decent.   I suggest only coming here if you're a guy looking for a casual sports bar to have drinks with friends... and don't order any of the food items. My other friend ordered a chicken sandwich and it looked really scary... he didn't want to eat it but he was really hungry.  My other friend ordered the nachos... from my view... it looked really cheap and horrible. No good quality here when it comes to food.  Parking wasn't a problem. Seating wasn't a problem. Very casual.   I would never be caught in a BWW again... first and last visit for me. Can't believe I spent 2 hours in here. yuck.  NEXT."}
{"text":"It was OK. The staff was attentive, our order was correct. Wings were good, a little undercooked,( jiggly fat skin)  but I tried something new and it was good. ( parmesan garlic no bone wings)I dont usually  order no bone... seems freakish. But they were well cooked and pretty good.  Complaint: The veggie boat we got was super slimy . I know this is a place  dedicated to meat products , but C'mon  AT LEAST  make the veggies respectable. They were worst than plastic packed carrot sticks. Celery looked dirty... and the gross slippery substance they were coated in was disgusting.  Ordered a salad there not too long ago.. ten bucks for some lettuce that smelled a little like chemical. I can get a fantastic salad for ten bucks at some other places. Guess  I should just go to those places, instead of bitching about it."}
{"text":"Waited for 15 minutes and no one came to serve us. A worker just looked at us at a distance and walked by. I was so hungry and tired of waiting that I started to eat my nails lol. Never will come here again!! Extremely poor service or lack there of. I cannot see this place lasting long with the poor service they provide."}
{"text":"Amazing service and awesome food! Definitely hit the spot! Thank you to Yomi!!! Definitely give this girl a raise! I'll be coming back for wings and the very best customer service. If you're in the area this restaurant is a must!"}
{"text":"I have been seeing people posting pictures of these wings and they actually looked good. So I decided to finally try them. Ordered the $15.99 combo\"fries,6 bone in wings and 6 boneless\". I received 8 boneless and 5 bone in, fries were ice cold, bone in wings were ok, except for the drums that were dry. Didn't receive a plate for bones or extra towels or wet nap. I had to call the server to bring me the check. Overall Buffalo Wild Wild need to teach the servers how to serve; overall the servers are polite, but need to be taught how to make the experience the best the customer ever had. My wife ordered the chicken grilled sandwich and she loved it."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs... The food is very overpriced and the drinks are very weak and over priced this place has gone down hill we will never go back"}
{"text":"Such a good atmosphere, awesome bartenders, great service. I enjoy coming here not only with family but with friends to drink and hangout too."}
{"text":"friend raved about the wings at this place, so went to try.  i couldn't remember what it was, but ordering at the cashier did not leave a good impression. service wasn't noticeably bad, but something just didn't click. and i remember the non-alcohol drinks were on the pricey side too, but i think they offer free water by the soda fountain or something like that--you just have to ask for a cup, or something (sorry it's been a while).  the wait for our two orders of wings (and maybe one other thing) was a good 20+ minutes.  seriously??  so went to the bar and asked the bartender to recommend a local beer.  got the wisconsin amber.  it was quite ok, and was only $5 too (is that too much for WI standard???  i don't know).  later on, went downstairs and found seats for ourselves.  THEN we saw a waitress serving the table next to us.  so what is the norm for this place anyway?  cafeteria style or waiter service???  completely confused.  anyways.  buzzer vibrated after a while, and we went up to get our food.  wings were good, but not something to die for.  the beer was better, by comparison.  won't mind going back, but probably not when you want something quick.  i think they're in an identity crisis where they still can't decide whether they wanna be a sit-down restaurant, fast food, or a bar/pub.  it seems they're trying to be all but not faring so well in any one place.  maybe the bar/pub image is the most successful among the three."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to BWW for about 8 years or so. When we moved here to AZ this location quickly became our go to.   We love it and the wings, their service is usually really good. It's upbeat and they have lots of tv's for your trivia, poker, any sporting even going on at the time etc. They have Golden tee which is a favorite of my Hubs- it's located on the bar side along with the Buck hunter game. :) We have had many Day drinking days there playing those games. Haha  Now that we have kids, we still bring them in, you can sit bar side or regular side with the kids. It's all pretty friendly. We have high chair users so we usually pick the regular side.   Over all we like it here a lot and these are my favorite wings! We like happy hour times for apps and drinks.  I will say that wings here have gotten really expensive compared to when they first opened. It seems like every few visits they bump the price up more, it's pretty nuts. Which I is part of the reason why we don't go NEARLY as often as we use to.  Tuesday's are wing day, but again, the deals just aren't what they use to be... it's a shame. I've noticed they aren't as busy on Tuesdays like they use to be, and probably for that EXACT reason. Their wing prices are why I didn't give them a 5 star."}
{"text":"Some of the best margaritas I've had is here... there wings were waaaaay to spicy I couldn't eat them but we ordered a huge pretzel which was pretty good."}
{"text":"Bdubs is my favorite place to watch a game.  Drinks are a little expensive but sometimes they have cheap specials.  Wings are the best I can find, and that's usually all I get when I go there, but their appetizers at good as well.  Make sure to get their at least an hour early if watching a popular sporting event!"}
{"text":"My major complaint here is that the \"bartender\" had no right to be behind the bar. This woman wasn't friendly, we couldn't hear here when she did speak, couldn't take orders, and was extremely slow at EVERYTHING. Whoever the manager is needs to never let this woman bartend again. I wish I knew her name. She worked during lunch on Saturday September 30th.   Food was the same it always is; slightly tasty and normal price for a wing place."}
{"text":"I love going to Buffalo Wild Wings, but this location had so much attitude. When I asked the host if we could sit at a booth instead she looked at me like she was annoyed and told me I was going to have to wait awhile. The waitress was also rude while taking our orders, she barely stopped by our table to check on us."}
{"text":"If I could rate this 0 stars I would. This has to be the absolute worst customer service I have received from a resturant. I got in there to have dinner around 4am/5am. We go to sit down at the bar area, the lady there was very rude she asked us for I.D's and we said we have a minor with us, she proceeds to say with an attitude, \" oh well you can order take out since our other seating area is closed\" we asked for the manager, he came out. Then my friend asked if she could speak to someone who spoke Spanish since she's more comfortable speaking in Spanish. He then got someone and we were able to finally sit at a table away from the bar after speaking to him. Everything was fine up until Kenya got off work, she went to leave and as she walked past us she said to my friend, \" Oh I thought you didn't speak English bitch \" as she was almost out the door she stood there looking at us telling us more rude remarks and to go outside. She has no right to sit here and tell us things like that ! After that incident happened everything was fine. Few minutes later we get ready to leave and as we are walking to our Valet some girl named Ciera came up to us with a CHECKBOOK in her hand it had receipts in it. ( most likely was our's & we didn't see her in the resturant either ) She had asked us if we went into Buffalo Wild Wings and we say, \" Yes, and the service was crappy \" We only said that because we thought she was taking survey's. Turns out it was Kenyas girlfriend and she threatened to beat us up. We never once called Kenya anything, didn't even speak to her and for Ciera to come up to us like that and threaten us it wasn't right. Ciera said she didn't want to lose her job since she needed it. If she needs her job so bad why would she sit there and cause a big ol' scene. I'm writing this review so people can stay the hell away from this location."}
{"text":"If you live in the deep west side of the Valley... You will appreciate this location! It literally is walking distance from my house and is in such a great plaza.  Anyways, this location is a decent size. The service is \"on point\" though. They are usually very quick on seating you. Just like all the other reviews - BWW is the perfect place to watch your sports shows. It gets really packed and full of energy during college basketball season, especially when the Rebels are playing.  My go-to order is a toss up between the honey bbq, chicken parmesan, and mild wings. I almost always have to get a regular order of french fries or potatoe wedges with cheese. It's a must in my book anyways. They have a good drink menu. I love their bahama mama - its the perfect fruity drink for me.  To sum it up, if you're craving wings and are on the west side. Don't forget to hit this location up.  Tip: Try to go on a Tuesday or Thursday for their discount price on traditional and boneless wings. If you like traditional go on Tuesday and if you're a fan of boneless go on Thursday."}
{"text":"The first time a came here it was all good. Server was great, food was ok. (Asked for wings well done)  But the second time! Omg I wish I remembered the server's name! He was TERRIBLE! We had a party of 7. It seemed like he didn't want to serve us. He barely checked on us. Only 1 person at the table was given a refill the whole time, after damn near hopping out of the seat to flag him down. My brother asked for a refill and he never brought it. When he walked by the table he would avoid eye contact. And to make matters worse the wings were slimy. It was just bad. I usually leave a good tip even if the server isn't great but this guy was so bad I literally wrote some tips on the receipt and hopefully he took note because that was the worst service I've ever received."}
{"text":"Luis was amazing! Great service! I got all flat wings with no questions asked and a free drink cozy!"}
{"text":"Its been a while since my last visit to this Buffalo Wild Wings due to a bad experience back in June. I called in today and spoke with manager Jaime and explained my past experience, she listened to my complaint and made me feel comfortable ordering again. I appreciate that Jaime herself took the time to take a detailed order. When I arrived I was greeted by Hostess Mikayla who greeted me with a smile and was extremely attentive while I waited for my food. Because of both Jaime and Mikaylas customer service I will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a steeler game or the pens if they ever do play. Great food, atmosphere and great service. UFC fights are always on here!!"}
{"text":"If you think you can come here for a quick lunch, you are horribly mistaken. I got here at 12:30pm and will be surprised if I get out of here by 2:30pm. Also, our service has been god awful."}
{"text":"I actually frequent this Buffalo Wild Wings location pretty often. And on some occasions I might have something minor happen like getting the wrong sauce on something or some food was cold, and we sent it back. Without hesitation, they've very apologetically fixed it and at a very speedy rate, at that. Other than those small issues, out of my many visits, I've have an enjoyable experience every time! I love their service, speed, food, and hospitality!"}
{"text":"We were seated quickly but waited forever for our food. If you want quick service, this may not be the place for you. Pro Tip: if you order from the fast break lunch menu, they only guarantee your order in 15 minutes or less for groups of 4 or less."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that as usual the wings are good. The problem is with the service...  We ordered 225 wings to go, along with fries and potato wedges. When ordered, we requested extra ranch and blue cheese. The lady taking the order to which I replied, that is fine, I am already spending $175, a few dollars for ranch isn't a problem.  When we picked up the food, they handed us a big bag and said here are your condiments. When we opened it, there were two ranch and two blue cheese... Oh, tons of ketchup which is what was filling the bag.  Called to let them know, expecting nothing more than a genuine apology and instead, the \"manager\" whose name was Chase let us know that is how many you get with that size order and we would have had to pay more for more. Absolutely no resolution and not even a sincere apology.  I would not recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Best Buffalo Wild Wings in Las Vegas. They do service right with speed and quality unlike the other Buffalo Wild Wings in town. Staff are super friendly during all my visits. Don't visit those other mediocre locations when you can be at the best one having a good time."}
{"text":"Excessively loud. Wait staff is lost. It takes a while to order and get drinks. The server forgot simple things like silverware and sauce for chicken tenders. The price is not worth the lack of service."}
{"text":"Great wings and sauce, and good service.    Very sports friendly."}
{"text":"Went in with a group of friends around 11pm, there was only a few people in there but yet the restaurant was trashed with no bussing or cleaning being done. We were there a little over 1.5 hours and the tables out on the patio were never cleaned up at all. Our waitress would only come on check on us once in a blue moon, I had to hunt her down to find her to let her know we needed the check. The restaurant was dead there's no excuse for dirty tables and filth.  The food was meh, boneless wings didn't have enough sauce and and a little dry. Had to return my beer because of the strange flavor it had. Not clean and poor customer service, I won't be back. Clearly the standards have fallen way low in this place, with plenty of other food choice to choose from nearby, BWW won't be receiving anymore money from me."}
{"text":"Possibly  the worst service  ever..... ordered 12 wings and was told 10 to 15 minute  wait. How long did it wait. Half  an hour. Fail bww  fail"}
{"text":"This place sucks.  The best part of everything was the lemonade. The service sucks the food very dry no flavor disgusting, nasty I do not recommend this place. Dominos pizza has better wings and their forte is PIZZA.  I order a cup of soup that is on the menu and they said we don't sell soup.... ah excuse you, it's on the menu. Noooo no soup...    Do Not Come here this place sucks!!!!!"}
{"text":"What's there to say about the wings and the beer? Tasty and delicious as always! The only reason why I gave three stars is because of the service. This location could definitely work on service that deals better with being under pressure, heavy restaurant flow, and overall courtesy. Tiffany the bartender is amazing, but other than that a lot of the waitresses/bartenders seem like they don't want to be wasting their time here. While the service doesn't bother me [too] much, it's definitely the BWW in town to visit if you're out for a late night craving."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to LOVE going to BWW back at home in Cali. When we found out we were moving next to a 24 hour one out here, we were stoked. 4 months later, we finally decided to try it. After tonight, I now realize why it took us so long to try it; IT SUCKS. 3 of our teams had games on, so we figured we'd stroll in tonight. We sat in the bar area, where we almost got up and left, several times. The only thing positive I can say about this trip, is the fact that the bartender was able to put together a drink I used to get at my home BWW; \"the lunch box\". Unfortunately, he failed to explain how I was going to be charged for it. But before I jump to explaining the bill, let's talk about the service. Our server was terrible. She took forever to take our drink order. When we placed our order, we had moved to sit at the actual bar since the seats were more comfortable. Once she found us and took our order, it was all downhill from there. Never came by to check on us again. We got our food from some other chick & the two bartenders were the ones asking if we were okay. I get it, we moved seats. But if you were handing us off to bartenders, you could have told us. Food was okay; nothing special. We only got 3 ranches, so I was hoping she would come by so I could ask for some more. Pretty sure she died because she never even acknowledged us again. So we're done with our food and praying somebody will give us a damn check... Another 15 mins. I wanted to scream when I looked at the check. So they charge .60 cents PER ranch. Had I known, I would've brought my own damn bottle! Also, we were charged $7.25 for the beer in our drink & 4.25 for each shot in each drink. If I'm going to pay almost $12 for a damn drink, I better be on the strip. & the cherry on top. So we asked for my boyfriend's veteran discount & they only give it on non sale items. A whopping .80 cent discount. Extremely, extremely disappointing dinner. Next time we want to watch a game, we'll be going to either a casino or an actual bar. Smh."}
{"text":"Had Brittany as a server she was located in the bar area. Brittany was the definition of amazing service! Me and my boyfriend go to Baffalo Wild wings 2 a week! This week we tried a new location. Like trying every new location we were wondering what to expect. Walking in we encountered a host. She had short blonde hair she was gave us attitude because we asked for a booth in the dinning area she sat us in a rude manner. Me and my bf decided not to sit there since she made a big deal about it. We went to the bar where we were served by Brittany an amazing work ethic she had! She had over 10 parties and she was able to manage all in a quick and accurate manner! I am satisfied with my service only because of her! If I had just walked in with the host experience I would have never came back! Thank you Brittany!!"}
{"text":"Our server Rae was amazing! She accidentally mixed up our wing order making the wait a little longer. However, she was quick to apologies and fix the problem! She got the manager to comp our wings and ordered us another set of free fries when the second order came out! She didn't have to do all that because we didn't complain in the first place!! I am in customer service so having such good experience was amazing!   Food was amazing and FRESH!   Thank you Rae"}
{"text":"I forgot what's it like to live in Las Vegas. Open 24-hours!!!  That's pretty cool.    Of course it's a chain restaurant, so the food tastes the same - as it should.    Not sure exarctly what it was, but my brother and I got a little sick from our food. But I'm not sure if it was just over eating or bad food, but I was nauseous in the morning and I keep burping the chicken taste.  So I won't fully put blame on them.   Also, we didn't over drink. We each had one beer.   Cool location and again awesome to have it open 24-hours.    Just to be safe, may want to double check the dates on that chicken...."}
{"text":"I've been here several times in the last year or so, and I feel like I must have been drunk each time because I swear I hardly remember anything.  Then again, maybe I do remember it correctly all things considered....  We go here to watch football with friends.  I can tell you more about the games than I can the food, though I remember really liking the wings and the fries.  And my friend likes one of their burgers - she couldn't remember the name when I asked her.  What I do remember is they have a great selection of TVs.  Folks were watching 2-3 different games and everyone thought they had a good seat for it.  That can be pretty rare in a sports bar.  And it was LOUD!  By noon or so we were having to speak pretty loudly just to hear each other.    It was still an awesome place to watch the game.  Food was good (Even if not overly memorable) and the atmosphere felt a bit nicer than a normal sports bar even though most folks were wearing sports themed clothing and yelling at the TV.  That alone is pretty impressive."}
{"text":"Came in to a great hostess then it pretty much went downhill from there. Our waitress (she didn't introduce herself so I didn't catch her name) wasn't having a good day. No smile, no emotion, she just straight to the point - \"Drinks?\" and walked off while I held my food order in my head. She returns and I order, gives me the same cold emotionless attitude and walks off. We eat, the food is actually good but we quickly called for the check. The waitress asked \"Now is there ANYTHING else you need?\" I'm sitting here eating, I didn't ask you for an extra straw, an extra napkin or anything so why give me this attitude like I'm overworking you? Anyways she's the waitress with the \"Lucky Leaf/ Four Leaf clover tattoo on her arm\"  After the bill comes I'm overcharged and the manager explains I was charged a bill from a different table. I receive a refund but this isn't the type of experience I'd shoot to duplicate. I'm pretty much over this place now that it's become so cold and dead. The last time I came there was a drunk \"air-humping\" his girl/some chick the whole time while she played her video games. There were kids around and staff simply laughed while that woman was being sexually made fun of in public. Kudos."}
{"text":"1 star based on a few situations but this one was the main reason. My daughters order was wrong, they said they would correct it. After 20 minutes the server came back to my daughter and asked if she would like anything else on the menu because they had messed it up for a second time."}
{"text":"26 TV's and not a one on NFL!  What the what?!? I  don't understand how you do not put one TV on the sport that you have been watching since 1pm."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings? Yes, please. Boneless wings? Oh yeah! A huge variety of sauces to smother said chicken in? Yup.  Scrumptious? You better believe it! Husband and I are big fans of the boneless wings. I loved the flatbread pizza, too.  This place is super chill--wings are served in paper trays, totally ok for your brats or obnoxious sports loving husbands. They have trivia, tons of TVs and decent service.  Tip:  Skip the special lemonade--it's Minute Maid with nasty syrup added."}
{"text":"Service is by far the worst, food was good but they could care less about the customer."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to any Buffalo Wild Wings. Vicci is a great server. It was good to go at a time when there was no wait. Vicci recommended sampling several sauces. I tried Honey BBQ, Asian Zing, Caribbean Jerk and Mango Habanero. They all taste great and if you like hot enjoy any of them. I went with honey bbq. My salad was delicious and filling. Nice portion size so I had to take some home. The croutons were hard as well as the garlic bread which was also cold when served. Hubby liked his cheese curd bacon burger. Note: There is a minimal cost for the sample fries to test the various sauces."}
{"text":"John was rude and cut us off because of a person we didn't even know but talked to. Unacceptable and rude behavior. Very rude with how he mentioned things. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Arguably the worst service at a wing joint in Cleveland. Routinely have to wait at least half an hour for at least 5-6 wings, which always seem to arrive with too little sauce yet not enough crisp. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Poor service, we watched a waitress drop another customers meal on the ground. We waited forever to get food and then waited again for a check. Food was good."}
{"text":"The food is always the same. Naked tenders are super small and overpriced. Takes wayyyyyyyy to long to get your beers or drinks from the bar when you sit in the dining room. But the wings are better than hooters and don't have as many creeps in there so we always go back. Would be better rating but the fact it takes 20 minutes every time to get a beer annoys me. Go to the bar for your own drinks is a simple solution"}
{"text":"One star because they are making a big deal about a no name, unimportant UFC fight and not the opening weekend of college football. Seriously, UFC has too many fights as it is."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Although I enjoy the food the wait staff and MANAGER are the absolute worst. I have been twice and neither times have been enjoyable and I have left angry both times. I will NEVER return ever again. The last time was a poor experience due to the long wait time for food. Tonight's experience was absolutely horrendous though. I arrived at 6:20 because the happy hour ends at 7:00 (3-4$ apps and drinks). I immediately put my name down and began waiting. At 6:50 I asked if my party of three would be seated before 7:00, as we had come for the happy hour. They said they were unsure. I asked if we could order off of the happy hour menu while waiting and they said no. At this point I had checked twice with the wait staff to find out how much longer the wait would be. Each time they said they weren't sure. At 6:55 I went to the bar to order a drink and the bartender refused to honor the happy hour price for drinks, even though it was not yet 7:00. She also poured the wrong beer for my friend, and forced my one friend to pay for all three drinks even though we wanted separate checks. Eventually, we were sat, at 7:20. A waiter approached us apologizing, saying that one of the new wait staff thought we had already been seated, which is why we had to wait an hour while a multitude of other groups sat. He also exclaimed that had we been seated properly, we would have been seated before the end of the 7:00 happy hour. I told our waiter this and so he brought the manager out to see if he would still honor the happy hour prices as it was the staffs fault that we weren't seated prior to 7:00. The manager claimed that there was nothing he could do, and did not apologize for his staffs error. I was left fuming. I have worked in multiple restaurants, and whenever there has been an error on the restaurants part, we have always provided a discount, or a free item. This Buffalo Wild Wings offered no apology, no discount, and no offer of any kind to apologize for their error. I specifically had come for the happy hour 40 min. in advance, and left two and a half hours later absolutely livid. I will never return, and would not advise anyone to ever set foot in a restaurant with such poor customer service. My entire evening has been ruined, as has my entire parties. I can not say enough how upset I am."}
{"text":"If you're in a rush, this is not the spot for you. Went here today with my coworkers. Upon arrival they told us the wait for food was going to be 25 minutes which we were okay with, however, we placed our order and we didn't see our food for over an hour. I understand that they are rather new and it's a busy week in Cleveland with the upcoming RNC activities, but the lack of communication and excessive wait was ridiculous. We spoke to the manager who tried to make it right by giving us a discount...but to add to the chaos, when the waitress cashed us out, she mixed up the checks and charged people incorrect amounts. Considering there are 2 other wing places next door with better service, I'll pass on BW3 next time I want wings. Sincerely, @216foodie"}
{"text":"This BDubs is really good! The service is fast and friendly and the wings are great. I didn't get any 'bad' boneless wings here (you know what I mean, connective tissue, no meat etc). And my waitress was really nice about the fact that I was in a hurry. She didn't even bat an eyelash when I asked to sit at a certain table.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings has the same great food that all of them do (assuming you're into wings) but the service is really so-so. Mostly because it look like it's waiters and waitresses are all teenagers. Which is great for the community, but bad for service.   Our waitress was really inattentive and completely forgot that my sister had ordered a beer to go with her meal. The meal came, but no beer. Then it took several minutes to flag her down and remind her.   Over all, not bad. But if you're going to staff your restaurant with young'ins then at least give them pointers as a group and teach them! The world is cruel, and it's hard to get a job, so train them better for the future!"}
{"text":"Great service today and food was nice and hot!  Mango Habenero was soooo hot I couldn't finish!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a bite to eat and a beer. Sat at the bar where half the chairs and tables were empty.  Two bartenders on duty who spent more time talking to the other staff at the service well than paying attention to customers.  When they did take a moment to check on customers, they paid more attention to couples sitting at the bar than me or the other four people also sitting solo. Chasing the bigger guest check and tip?  As mentioned, planned to have dinner. Neither bartender came within shouting range for me to get their attention. Held the menu up and still no reaction. Actually, at that point, one of the bartenders disappeared.   Sat with a glass that was almost out of beer and STILL couldn't get attention. All of this took place in a 30-minute period. I had enough and cashed out. LITERALLY had to shout twice to get their attention.   In case you're wondering, dinner across the street at Native Grill was delicious with speedy and friendly service. The bat area at Native was packed. Not a single empty chair, table, or booth. This BWW wishes they were that busy.  Second time here and second time it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Nice place. Friendly staff. Just like any other Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"This place is over priced for it's lack luster cuisine. If you are looking for more than your your everyday, run-of-the-mill commercial chain restaurant, do not eat here!"}
{"text":"TOO loud of a joint with just mediocre service.  Most of the servers in there act as if they had just woken up from a hangover.  It wouldn't have been that big of deal, except that it was 7:00 in the evening!  The choices at B-Dubs always make up for the service though.  I have yet to find a seasoning I haven't liked.  Me an my girlfriend love to go out and order a large wing order and split it in to 1/4's with different sauces and rubs.  It always makes for a great experience."}
{"text":"Well the location itself isn't bad but our server DALLAS V was very rude and she was showing so much attitude when i asked her that we didn't order carrots when i specifically said celery and at every buffalo wild wings through out the US my husband and I order the same thing and she is like we don't do split sauces here except Thursdays i am like well can u ask your manager to be sure because we have been ordering the same thing through out different days and on many many different locations for the past two years. And she rudely said to me that she has been working here 9 years and blah blah and she didn't wanna go ask the manager because of her attitude! Really pissed right now and hopefully we never have to stop at this location again because we were just crossing states and stopped by to eat. everyone else was very friendly though!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food friendly staff and love all the tv's, the atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. What else can I say. RICHARD, is probably the worst waiter I've had. He checked up on us once. He has no personality what so ever.  My friends and I ordered all wings, all 6 of us. The food runner, bless her heart, attended to us more than Richard. Richard was a \"Dick\". He is lucky we even tipped. This rating only got 2 stars because the wings were great. Had a lot of sauce on them and were well cooked.  Go to native or a different wing place. Bad service ruined my experience"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best practical jokes I've witnessed in awhile.  It started with a fake website that doesn't transmit your online order.  Genius, right?  It was even more funny when I got my food an hour later to find that they had left my chicken pink in the center.  I love a good salmonella gag!  What a bunch of cut ups, best of luck in your future bits."}
{"text":"The Northlake Buffalo Wild Wings location is quite possible the worst BDubs in all the franchise.  I've been here several times and I have yet to have a good experience. The service is lousy. The food tastes isn't consistent. I enjoy BDubs,  but I can't come back to this place anymore."}
{"text":"Horrible. My gf ordered a salad with chicken and wing sauce. The salad was completely drenched in sauce. When the server came by I mentioned it to her but she cut me off mid sentence and then walked away. I know she heard me because she didn't come back at all except to drop off the check.  Bad service and bad food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Had Caribbean Jerk and and garlic Parmesan and they were very good, waitress was friendly and food came in a timely manner I would stop here again on my next trip"}
{"text":"This Buffalo Wild Wings is terrible. When we got there there was no one there to seat us or even to greet the guests and we had to wait 15 minutes for a seat when there were multiple seats and booths open. Our server was really nice but slow we didn't get to order for a good 20 minutes after being seated and when we got the food is was dry,fatty and nasty. I will not go back to this one I should've just went to five guys next door."}
{"text":"I ordered a take out order from this particular BWW and it was a busy night..I was greeted by the sweetest girl I have ever seen there..her name tag reads \"Lil Bit\" she was so sweet! She made sure I was taken care of and made sure everything I asked was done...I have picky eaters in my family and she even recommended that I check my order before leaving the restaurant! Thank you Lil Bit for all of your help! You definitely are an MVP!! Even though this BWW is a little far from my house, as long as people like Lil Bot continue to work there, this will be my spot!"}
{"text":"Great wing, decent service. It takes a while though, but it can be busy, I understand that. Mannerism isn't exactly top notch so I might stay away if I were easily upset by that, but I'm honestly in it for the wings."}
{"text":"Fast service really good to come to during a sporting event. No big games showing today thought I come through and enjoy a lovely meal with my mother. I really like the wings and completed the Blazin challenge once. I particularly love the mango habanero wings for those who love spicy food if not they a wide selection of other wings to choose from. :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times, & each time it's awful. Nothing is organized from the host, to the waitresses/waiters, to the bathrooms. I understand it's a busy location, but they really need to get it together. this location gives b dubs a bad name. We won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Called to place an order. Brittany answered the phone and immediately was rude for no reason. She accused the order to be a prank even after being explained that the order was large because of the family size (asked for 2 orders of 40 wings) she hung up and I immediately called right back and asked to speak to a manager. Low and behold it was ms Brittany again and in her same demeanor was highly rude. When the the manager was on the phone, he had the audacity to tell me to help him out by accepting the fact that the phone call was a prank. After telling him 3 times that this was not a prank and indeed a legitimate order. He refused to apologize nor offer to take the order all together. Which by the way he was rude as well. I will no longer be providing  my business to this location as they obviously do not have customer service etiquette at all."}
{"text":"2 stars because the wings were delicious,  I am really surprised that service has gone down in most places. I'm not sure if it's because they see a family and choose not to check how we are and think we won't tip. Which I did leave over 20% tip. It's just poor service brings good food down."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't really like buffalo wild wings. Never really have but I went here for my brothers graduation dinner. (It was somewhere we could go that was open late).   I felt bad for our waitress.  We were a 20 top reservation and maybe 16 ppl showed. Or 15. We all came in at different times due to when we got out of graduation traffic and trying to find our graduate. We had that server running back and forth as she was trying to keep up with ppl showing up little by little. She did her best though! I can't blame her as we were The difficult ones.  The only thing I will say is that they really should give more cheese for the appetizer with pretzel and so dip for chips... I had to ask for more. Made no sense to have more chips and more pretzel than dip. Cooks should know. Both were half full and it was a small cup as it was."}
{"text":"Food is average at best. But we came to watch March Madness, not for a 5 star dinner. Service was acceptable. They had all he big games on. If you want to watch sports and have some ok bar food this is the spot."}
{"text":"Service was slow and none of the tables were clean when we walked in, even though the restaurant wasn't busy at all. Food took forever to come out and nacho chips were stale. Wings had no sauce on them and they ran out of silverware so I have a plastic fork to eat with lol...  I've never been to a BWW that was this bad.....yikes"}
{"text":"I occasionally come with my coworkers and each time I come I enjoy my time here. I always forget to write but today Brian's service was so great that I just had to leave a great review. He was a one man show and did a fantastic job keeping up with everything. I was never without water, he was on top of it. My coworkers think he did a great job working alone. Great employee you guys got here. Food was great as always but Brian is the reason this place gets a 5 star"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings can't good reviews you might tell yourself. Well that's until you come to this one. This place is ran like a normal establishment. Very friendly service and fast service. I couldn't believe it coming from a BWW. This is the best BWW ever."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several different Buffalo Wild Wing locations, but this particular location was a bad experience. Mostly just bad service. I bartender/waitress was missing half the time, so I couldn't get refills. I asked for my salad first, but she brought it with my food. The food took a long time, and then semi warm when it came, so I'm sure it was ready in the kitchen, but my server didn't notice it for a while. Then when I finally wanted to leave I couldn't find her to pay my bill and leave."}
{"text":"This is based off my experience with getting to go food late at night after work. They answer the phone right away always friendly.  If I ever have to wait a few minutes longer for the food they always offer me a bottle of water while waiting which I think is a nice touch. Food is always made right. Good location"}
{"text":"Not bad. The buffalo sauce is pretty hot. Kid friendly with games. All in all not a bad place to take tour family for a quick meal. Never busy at lunch so you can get in and out...."}
{"text":"There's always a lot of problems when it comes to ordering through a second party delivery service, indicating who's fault it is is always too complicated to figure it out. I ordered through Postmates slightly disappointed about the fact that the order I put in should've been a 10 piece rather than a 5, which I received. Postmates is really annoying since you can't directly talk to anyone with problems you have so I decided to call BWW on this matter, the fact that David, the manager, was exceptionally nice enough to give me credit for my unhappy meal really made things a whole lot better. They don't have to fix your problems with a second party but he decided to anyway for the satisfaction of the customer. I'm a consistent BWW customer and will continue being one because of that great service itself ! I eat BWW at least once a week and I always tell my friends that the servers and service is always on point, the fact that they resolved an issue that wasn't really their fault makes me believe their service will continue to be exceptional !!"}
{"text":"I'm a consistent bdubs customer. I love chicken wings and no matter what I'll always go here. It's awesome because it happened to be Tuesday half off wings ! Or they call it buy one get one as well. At this location on eastern, I did a pick up order. Kim was on the phone with me placing my order, I'm a server myself so if the service is really good on the phone I have to yelp. She was nice and very informative and when I wanted to change around my order like an annoying customer she didn't mind at all and was very sweet. I love that. Thank you bdubs  for another satisfied customer !"}
{"text":"Update: decided to give the place another try. Our server Vanessa was wonderful. Food was hot and just as we asked. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is just like every other Buffalo Wild Wings. If you are looking for somewhere to watch a sports game with fellow fans, this is a good place to go. If you are looking to have a dinner and converse when friends, avoid this place. It is very loud all the time. Overall, the food is good (I mean, it's wings), and it's a bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Football Sunday where else would you want to be!!! Thank you always Todd &  Alicia for the outstanding service!!"}
{"text":"yesterday almost midnight a young female server at the bar accept our order everything was pretty quick except on my wings it sucks I really long time Superdry  the new bartender relive her dont even ask us nothing after I had to ask him for another beer  two people at the bar only besides us .bottom line is you have to ask 10 times to get the wings wet I should have sent it back but I not that kind of person."}
{"text":"Well better services now at lease the comp my drinks yeahhhh i was plying kinda big bu the best employee there has to be Madison the take out girl . This f$%# stupid idiot has to curse in Every sentence that he speak just to prove that he speak English...."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location once and most likely it will be the last. I'll stick to the one I normally go to by the south outlets.. I had been craving wings for a few days now, and it was late. Most places were closed, so we decided to stop by this location. Which I'm a bit embarrassed to admit, but I didn't really even know this location existed lol..  We were getting the food to go. When entering we waited about 5mins before anyone greeted us. There were a couple of employees sitting in a booth. I guess it gave us time to look over the menu. The place was empty, except for one or two customers at the bar.  Once we were ready, which was instantly, we kinda already knew what we wanted lol.. I asked the young lady if the spinach artichoke dip was still served with pita chips instead of the tortilla chips. Because some locations still do it and since I had never been to this one, I wanted to make sure before ordering it. If they no longer did it, then I wasn't going to order it. No big deal. She wasn't sure at first and then she said yes. So then I asked her if she was sure and she replied yes again! So I went ahead and ordered it. We also ordered some wings and a salad.  We decided to wait for our food at the bar, figured we'd have a drink while waiting. As I sat down my friend went to the restroom, there were about three people behind the bar. After 5mins or so my friend comes back from the restroom and not one \"bartender\" had approached me or even acknowledged that i was there. I tried grabbing their attention a couple of times but I guess they were too busy.. when the bartender approached me and asked if we wanted anything, our food was already ready so we didn't get a drink..  I knew I should have checked the food before leaving but I was already a bit irritated so we just left. When we got home, I went straight for the dip since my mouth was watering just thinking about it. When I opened it, I wasn't even surprised that they messed up! Smh, they gave me tortilla chips instead of the pita chips that I specifically asked for! And to top it off the dip wasn't that great! (yes we still ate it) the wings were delicious and so was the salad.   But the service, for a bww establishment is not that great! I will stick to my original location.."}
{"text":"Went there really late (10:30pm). It was pretty empty, so we got full attention from the waitress. The food is great though. I had the bbq wrap, which was made perfectly to balance with the meat and the lettuce. Mmm. The sauce in it was yummy.   This is would be a great place to just hang out with friends and eat great wings. Must visit again when I'm there."}
{"text":"Horrible!! They advertise on the menu you can mix the flavors. When we asked for some combined the waiter told us we can't, confused with his attitude he was giving us waiting forever for drinks poor poor service!! We asked to speak with the manger! She gave even more attitude, about everything. We asked how come we can mixed flavors as it says you can on the menu, her response was that they don't have enough bowl to do so. First thing that came to mind was well you have a dishwasher???!! She shrugged it off. There was 2 other tables not like they where busy. I could see if they where busy not washing there dishes or waiting an hr for a drink. The manger should not be in the position she is in to say the least excuse after excuse rude and very bitchy. To top it off the food was very salty that's all you could taste in most the flavors. For having wings as the main thing wasn't impressed by far the worst wings I have tried!"}
{"text":"I was left disappointed and feeling that BWW is completely OVERRATED! The service really sucked as our server had the personality of a donkey. We observed the super tall Manager approaching the tables around us to resolve complaints. I should have complained as well about the service and food but I just wanted to pay and get the hell on with my night. My cheeseburger and fries were cold and hard, my burger bun tasted stale. I had to swap my iced tea for a root beer as it was a bad brew, it looked and tasted like sewer water. My friend was happy with her wings and that was about it. Yes, I should have ordered wings, I just was not expecting their non wing menu to taste like SOS! I am totally unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Placed a order on line, said 20 minutes to pick-up. Arrived at store in 10 minutes, woman at counter answered the phone 3 times as we stood their waiting. After giving her our name for the order waited another 30 minutes until the order was ready. Their is no customer service here. After getting our food and going home around 3 to 5 minutes to get home, the wings were already cold. This was the first and will be the  last time I ever order from here."}
{"text":"For a place that specializes in chicken wings, the wings were surprisingly underwhelming. My daughter's wings were supposed to be mild, but they had the same amount of kick as my medium wings. My son's mini corn dog serving was minuscule. I have a feeling I'll be back, though, because my husband loves all of the huge screen TVs playing sports galore. We had to ask them to turn the volume down because it was deafening but they happily complied. Nice waitress but the food was slow in coming out."}
{"text":"Great service. Great wings. And a great atmosphere. I love stopping in here when in town. Also was lucky enough to have some Kent state cheerleaders at the table next to me. Sorry for the title \"creeper pic\" but I did what I had to. Also, the bathrooms were clean. Good enough for my inspection."}
{"text":"Ate here last night whole table had boneless wings that were way over cooked. I also got the breaded mushrooms that ironically were under cooked. Plus it was extremely over priced for glorified bar food. And we were shoved in a table in the back room squeezed in between 2 four tops when we asked for a booth. The only reason I gave it a second star is because our waiter was awesome. Very attentive and informative I believe his name was Josh he saved the whole experience for me."}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on today, they are not that busy. This has been the worst experience ever. The service was bad super slow and the food when it finally came out was cold."}
{"text":"Service was good, but the wings were pretty bad, same wing just different sauce, no meat, really for wing place bad. Had the desert called \"fried cheesecake cubes\" and really they were terrible. everything is served in cheap cardboard paper cup type dishes. Very surprised people like this place, and seems for a large chain type place  they would have it figured out. I wont go back for a long time , unless maybe to watch a game and get one drink, as they do have alot of TVs."}
{"text":"needed to grab some dinner and what are the odds we come on .70 boneless wing night.  ordered 3 types  a hot BBQ , Asian Zing and Medium  they had great flavor and the wings nice and crispy. we shared a basket of Buffalo Chips and appreciated that did not come salted. we had fun dipping into the sauces and I tried to be good with a garden salad with tomatoes and cucumbers and red peppers shaved Parmesean and my choice of dressing on the side. our waiter came around just enough to make sure we were fine and brought plenty of hand wipes and napkins"}
{"text":"I have been going to B Dubs for years. I used to frequent the location across from the Great Lakes Mall back in my 20's. Back then, the menu was limited and I'd always order the same thing: buffalitos and pepperoni pockets.    Here we are 15 years later and it's nice to see this franchise doing everything right. They've kept their signature items on the menu and have added many more options. This location is going to be my new \"go-to\" place for watching all of the sporting events. We stopped in for lunch when it first opened and the place was packed! However, there's ample seating and a friendly wait staff to keep things moving along.   If you're in a cocktail mood, try the Buffalo Zoo. It's quite tasty and packs a punch! The draft beer prices are reasonable and still served in their signature tall glasses.   Food wise, you can't go wrong. Personally, I'm a buffalito fan with hot barbecue. I also love trying their different wing flavors and the new ones they release on a regular basis. Unfortunately, this location did not have the Mayan Mole that was advertised in their menu.   Way to go, B Dubs. Thanks for coming to Willoughby!"}
{"text":"I live nearby and we go to this place a lot. The food is usually good, service is usually fast, and the beer outs always cold. Also, they have  pretty decent beer selection.   My only criticism is that sometimes the wings come out under sauced. Not a huge deal, but annoying for a place whose built their business on sauce.   Love the chili con queso, mozarella sticks and fried mushrooms."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed BWW.  The spicy garlic wings are incredible.  The kids love the wings and finds it fun to eat without utensils.  The drinks are decent and the waitresses at this location seem to be better than the waitresses I have had at other locations.  We are usually seated right away and it's always quick to get our order.  I don't go during big games because I enjoy good service."}
{"text":"Whether I'm getting lunch during work or having some drinks and wings with the crew, he spot. The Mango is hotter than the Wild, FYI. Huckleberry lemonade is nice during work, and Dos Equis on tap is even better after work."}
{"text":"Great service, yummy food. Power outlets at the tables to charge your devices, with USB ports. Hard to find a quiet place to eat on the strip. This is quiet and cozy."}
{"text":"By far worst service I have ever had in an establishment. Showed up at 9:47 PM on a Monday night and the place was a wreck. Yes they were kind of busy but every single available table, bar and restaurant side, was dirty. I asked a server in the bar if I could snag a table once they cleaned it, she said sure and proceeded to only grab her check off the table instead of clearing off anything else when she had a cleaning rag in her hand. I stood at the dirty table from 9:50 until 9:56 and that is when I lost my cool. She then took her time to greet three other tables, take their drink and food orders, take an order for another table behind us before coming by to clean off the table. Never greeted herself. She cleared the table and then still took another 10 minutes to come back to get us drinks. We did not get any drinks until 10:22. A table that came in after us had drinks and food before she even took our food order. She was horrible. Never asked if our food was alright, how we were doing, if we needed anything else. She was rude and you could tell she hated her job. I'm a server, there's a difference to being annoyed with a table and then just being plan horrible at your job and providing the worst service you could. Definitely never coming back."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly service here, and food was fairly good as well.  A lot of families were present, but thankfully you couldn't hear them because the soccer television audio was turned up incredibly loud.  Garlic 'shrooms were tasty and I love the thick cut homemade potato chips.  Only irritation is the inaccurate beer menu on the tables.  Apparently they have a bit more craft beer on tap than what the menu indicated, and I would rather have had some of the Red Nectar ale or Black Butte or Grand Canyon instead of the basic macro-imports and domestic-macro that were listed on the pre-printed menu."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service.  Wasn't busy on our visit, but that did not seem to matter as it was difficult to order additional beers and food.  Apps took a long time as well.  Happy Hour menu was pathetically small and nearly every app we wanted was excluded from the happy hour discounts."}
{"text":"Came here to eat wings on a Saturday at 430pm. Place only had about 4 people seated which is not very busy so we expected to get great service! Sat for about 15 minutes with servers passing our table by. Around 11 or 12 servers and bartenders just standing around talking to each other including a manager and no one even acknowledged that we were there. After all that time we just got up and left to go eat somewhere else!! Terrible experience. I will never return to this location!!"}
{"text":"So a few restaurants i wanted to initially go to were super crowded cause of knights hockey game. This place was croweded too but it has lots of seating  so i assumed we'd be seated right away and we were even though it was packed inside.    I go to a lot of concerts and this was louder than one inside. The knights game was on which i didnt care about but that's my prob cause i went to a sport's bar. But come on.... it was louder than a guns and roses concert.  Like headache loud.   Ok now lets talk about the food. I ordered the chicken ceaser salad and my date ordered wings. The Ceasar sauce and chicken were the most disgusting things I've ever put in my mouth.  The wings were greasy overly sauced nasty chicken pieces. Mcdonalds is way better than this and 1/3 of the price.  Fyi I'm not a big fast food person.   Go to McDonald's save your money and then go blast the game at home to save your money."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened in 2009.  Overall, a nice establishment.  First, this place is extremely clean. They actually cover all of the liquor bottles every night and clean the beer tap lines every week. Pretty impressive.  Food is usually very good and fresh. Occasionally, If you order wings or fries they'll try and send out a batch that's been sitting in a warmer for a half hour. You can tell non-fresh wings when you see them. If they aren't too hot to eat (or close to it) when you first get them, they aren't fresh - send them back. This place carries a premium price tag (especially on non-wing special nights). For the price you're paying, you deserve piping hot FRESH wings. They are always good about remaking them if you complain. Same goes for fries.  Waitstaff are really good and friendly. Recommend a visit. Insist on fresh food, though!"}
{"text":"Been here many times. Food is usually pretty good. Used to be open real late which worked well with my schedule. That's changed now.  They've been gradually moving closing time up earlier and earlier each year, to where now it's no longer convenient for me. \"last call\" on any night other than Friday and Saturday is now 10:30pm SHARP. They close at 11pm sun-thurs, midnight Fri and Saturday. Come in at 10:32pm on Thursday expecting a beer?  20-30 people in the restaurant, shouldn't be a problem right? Forget it, the bartender will give you a dirty look - she's doing everything she can to go home ASAP.    They gotta fix the culture here. I hate bar/grills that close early and make you feel like you're inconveniencing them by coming in late. You're a bar, you're supposed to be open late!"}
{"text":"Was amazing went there for lunch they really served us in a timely manner and got job done and def had an amazing experience can't wait to eat again I love me some wings and there fantastic sauces"}
{"text":"I used to come here often, was disappointed the manager didn't have the sound turned up when the game started. The steak quesadilla were adequate and the mini chocolate cake was large and tasty."}
{"text":"Wings wings and more wings! TVs TVs and more TVs! 90% of the time you're going to get top-notch service here and there's always a lot of selections as far as food and alcohol.  Great place to go watch a game because they have literally every game on all the time! Go Lakers!!"}
{"text":"I like this place, the servers are knowledgeable and friendly as well as attentive. My favorite items are shrimp and fried pickles.  That said....  I do have a suggestion to the management -do your staff a favor and get them one of the name brand cordless stick vacuums that starts with a D. - they will get the mess cleaned up faster so they can help other customers. I watched one poor girl go over some crumbs 50 times with the non electric push thing. Don't be penny wise and pound foolish.  A happy staff gets more work done."}
{"text":"tuesday i come here with friends or family always an amazing time cant get enough of the boneless wings amd the asian zig sauce its amazing especially on Tuesdays is buy one get one free u cant beat that and i always get extra crispy because cooks the meat better inside and just comes out perfect again awesome place with great taste and price!"}
{"text":"Wings are overcooked, have very little sauce, soaked in a pool of grease, and have no flavor. .    I have given them 3 or 4 chances and it seems like it is getting worse.   Do not waste your time or money on this disgusting food."}
{"text":"My cousin and I stopped by for lunch on a weekday. It wasn't very busy, which means it wasn't very loud, which I was happy about. I bet it gets a little crazy there when games are on. The dining area is rather large and there are multiple TVs.  Anyway, Cousin and I started with the soft pretzels. They were good and came with queso and spicy mustard. I'm not in to wings (too much work), but I love chicken. We both had the chicken strips with buffalo sauce and fries. Neither of us really cared for the ranch dressing, but I need it to balance out the buffalo, so I ate it anyway. I don't usually like shoestring fries, but these are nice and crispy. Then we tried the chocolate fudge cake with ice cream (I think that's what it was called). Delicioso. But I was stuffed and couldn't eat much of it.  My only gripe is that the staff was a little TOO attentive. I know, I know. I sound like a crazy person. But between our server, her trainee, and the guy who kept asking us to give donations and sign up for the BWW club... it was a little much.  However, I'll take that over being neglected. So I'm sticking with 5 stars."}
{"text":"One of the best places near Phoenix for chicken wings. Serves innumerable variety of wings (sauces) over a scale of spiciness. Parmesan Garlic and Thai Curry wings are my favorites (neither too spicy nor sweet). It has dirt cheap offers on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Great sporty ambience with a decent selection of beers to have alongside wings."}
{"text":"Wings, Beer, Sports, NTN Trivia --- I mean, it's pretty self explanatory when you go into a Buffalo Wild Wings : )  Nothing bad. Just chill vibe, and chill food."}
{"text":"I came here at 10 p.m. on a Tuesday night. I was sat on the patio and waited and waited and waited. I saw the hostess throw her arms up in exasperation when I didn't get served. I kept leaning over and staring at all the servers but no one ever came to the patio. I waited for a full 15 minutes. As I was walking out the door I noticed a manager there, so I called the restaurant. When I explained the situation to him, he gave me an apathetic response of \"I'm sorry.\" Now I work in upper management and I thought it was weird that he didn't say anything else...just silence. So I said \"You don't seem very concerned.\" He came back with  \"I am, it's too bad you don't come back.\" Or something to that effect. Honestly trust the other reviews. Depending on the day you go (esp if the manager is there) total nightmare. Honestly it should be the opposite. If a manager's on site everybody should be hustling. Anybody who has had poor service, I recommend complaining to corporate.  ***Update: After I left a scathing review with Corporate the ACTUAL manager of the restaurant personally called me. She agreed with my sentiments and was upset with the supervisor and wait staff. I just really hope they get their act together..."}
{"text":"I often find myself in the NE quadrant running errands or meetings for work, which opens opportunities to try new places that I otherwise wouldn't think of going into.  Buffalo Wild Wings is one of those places, at first I got the impression it was a bar/pub set up and I'm not up for bar and pub gatherings for lunch, but after hearing my brother often comes here for burgers and cheap wings on Monday, I decided what the hell.  My husband had a hankering for a burger and wings and I am always up for wings, so in we went.  It is a very large space, the area further in the back is probably where all the action happens, we sat in the main dining area and it was relatively quiet.  Our waitress was really pleasant and offered us the lunch menu and informed us of the 75 cent wings.  The man was all in for the lunch burger combo and I was already salivating for them wings.  There are so many options for dry seasoned or sauced up or a combo of both that I felt overwhelmed with all the options and asked the waitress to give me a few of the top pics, I finally settled on medium BBQ sauce, a dry smokey hot seasoning and one that I wouldn't think of trying, a creamy Parmesan. The wings were a decent size and sauced up quite well, almost too well because they were all really salty which I know keeps the beer flowing but either way, I managed to finish most of them and my husband had a few as well and agreed that the dry seasoned ones were much better than the sauced ones.  His burger was good, not great but the fries also were way over salted.  The price was very reasonable, I think it was something like $10.  If you are monitoring your sodium intake, this might not be the place for you.  Also, you can bring your kids here as long as they stay in the dining area, I noticed the waitress gave two little ones these gaming devices that they both were playing on during their stay, nice touch.  All in all a decent place to come in for some cheap wings and burgers, although everything was overly salted, the pop kept coming and the waitress was super helpful.    Solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This place was OK at best. For a place that includes the word \"wings\" in their name, you'd expect them to be home to some of the best wings imaginable. Far from it. I've had ALOT better at their competitors.   The bar is somewhat decent, the service was fast and they had a lot of television sets. Beer was also ice cold when I was here but the food lacked flavour and freshness severely. We tried the wings, terrible.   Probably won't be back here anytime soon, or ever for that matter."}
{"text":"If there was a way to add no stars I definitely would. This place is a joke. Today my fiancé and I came in after work only to find the worst hostess ever. Unfortunately I didn't get any names but we came in and we asked her for a booth for two. There was 3 booths empty all hadn't been cleaned she told us to wait for 15 minutes . My fiancé and I however did not mind the wait at all , we know how it can get on game day (go cubs!) so after we sat down a party of 5 , 3 & 4 came in. Every single one of those party's got seated before us. At this point I was a little irritated so my fiancé went and checked with what was now the manager at the front booth only to find out that nor his or my name were written to be seated.  So the manager added our name to the template and we noticed that there weren't any more booths available at this point. The manager then walks over and try's to seat us at a Table and at that point I didn't even get up from where I was seated in the waiting area. At the end of the day we drove 2 1/2 more miles down the road to The Centennial location where our service was great. . I just feel like if you're management you might want to treat customers a little better or at least write our names down. At the end of the day we never complain because nobody wants spit in their food."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is perhaps my favorite cookie cutter type restaurants The wings are always cooked perfectly and I have no complaints about the food here.   I do have to comment on poor service as the daughter and I who both ordered spicy food had empty drinks for at least five minutes. (Twice) I finally just waved down another server and begged for some liquid relief.    Oh and cant forget the gang tags found in the bathroom. Just be careful not to wear the wrong color or sport team jersey as you may get shanked.  I won't be back as there are numerous places to get wings with great customer service that doesn't disappear when your drink gets low."}
{"text":"I have come here for every NBA finals game thus far and have received nothing less than excellent service and a great atmosphere. The waiting staff is upbeat and friendly the bartenders arw cool.. and fellow patrons have been fun to mess with during the series."}
{"text":"First problem was entering in with my group, and not getting noticed by 5 waiters standing at the door. I had to ask TWO people for a table. Second problem was the wait staff was gathered at a table all talking to each other, 4+ people being loud was distracting from our family visit. And well...3 strikes and your out."}
{"text":"Just had diner here and overall.... it was exactly what I expected. Lots of wings with a variety of flavors to choose from. Service was decent but did not blow me away and food was tasty... However, the prices of beer seemed a little higher then normal, or what I would have expected.   I guess we can't have it all can we."}
{"text":"Wings and booze, need I say more?   Oh and it's a great place to watch sports to but your butt may get sore from sitting in their flat wooden booths after awhile. Maybe drink more?"}
{"text":"What can I say, I am a big fan of BWW. Especially on Tuesday's where they have the wing specials and happy hour in the bar area during the evening. The staff has always been friendly and food consistent."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I've ever gotten at a BWW....actually any restaurant ever. I asked what seasonal/craft beers were on tap and our server literally said \"I dunno I don't like beer.\" Then brought everyone the wrong beers and tried to convince our table that everyone got what they ordered. Also at the end, I ordered carry out for my roommate and it was forgotten. I had to ask the host where my food was 30 mins later because my server never came back."}
{"text":"The waiter was very courteous and kind. The wings were very delicious. The bathrooms were clean and the manager gave great customer service. However the hostess gave poor customer service. It appeared that she did not want to work and moved very slowly with no urgency to clean available table and seat guess."}
{"text":"Paid $10 + for \"ultimate nachos\" which were tortilla chips with NO meat or anything else for that matter. Iceberg lettuce and chips...seriously? I even had to add my own salsa because there wasn't  enough. Burger has a rubber texture...awesome. Thank you for wasting my money B-Dubs."}
{"text":"This place is packed if there is a Penguin game! It's consistently busy on the weekends too. The service is hit or miss. We see a lot of new waitresses and some are very friendly, while others, not so much. My main reason for coming here is the Twisted Margarita. Yum! Their Mac n cheese is also amazing.  My husband loves their chicken fingers and fries. An appetizer of soft pretzels is also a great pick. Best around!"}
{"text":"What a joke this location is. Placed an order online for a small basket of traditional wings. Showed up at the requested time and the order wasn't ready. Had to wait an additional 15 or so minutes until my order was ready and the only offer I got was a small soda (which I didn't want). I'll stick the location in Tempe because this is a joke. I mean the cashier even admitted my order wasnt started until I showed up.  What were y'all doing before that?"}
{"text":"BWW has by far the best boneless wings ever.  I hate wings most of the time because of fighting your way into bones.  I actually never really liked them until I tried BWW.  The sports scene is great because you have multiple games going on from different sports.  We went on Boneless wings Thursdays where I think each wing is 69 cents.  What a wonderful number, eh?"}
{"text":"We always come here every Thursday for boneless wings, burgers, and beer!  They recently renovated this location so it has a more open feel and it's also not as dark as it used to.   If you come here during prime hours,  you should be expecting a lengthy wait time if you do not plan to sit at the bar.    Besides the wings being the focal point of this joint, I suggest others to try out their burgers. Their nacho burger and angry orchard chicken burgers are to die for.  Also, try their seasonal beers!  The staff is also very friendly, we haven't had a bad experience with staff!  They try to get your food out as fast as they can but at most times, they do get backed up. I normally have to wait half an hour for my food to get out. I'm not in the restaurant business so I'm not sure how they can improve productivity but I'll leave that one up to them.!  4 stars for food and staff -1 star for lengthy wait times!  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"The services at this place is always just okay. The food always seems to take forever to come out.   On a good note, all the things I've ever tasted have been delicious.  Right now I really like the new wing flavor, Jammin Jalapeño.  The flavor is delicious and it had just the right amount of kick!"}
{"text":"I come here one a week with my bestie! On Thursday they have a good wing deal and my favorite  $3 long island ice tea's!!!"}
{"text":"We had excellent service the last time we went. The food was yummy at a decent price. The music was a little too loud for my taste, but it's to be expected at a sports bar. Great for groups."}
{"text":"The service is great. Food as expected. However, I am reluctant to ever return as no one in the few times I have been has seemingly ever cleaned the bathrooms. The sinks are black with filth. Doesn't speak well for a place of food preparation hygiene."}
{"text":"Good food but you can get that in other BWW. Waited to be greeted for 6 minutes the host came out from the back chewing gum still talking to other crew members. I had  called in the order and was told it would be 15 minutes I got there in 20 and had to wait anther 15 minuets. The BWW in tempe definitely out ranks this one. over unhappy with this store"}
{"text":"WARNING: FOOD POISONING! I ordered the CLASSIC CHICKEN WRAP (Honey BBQ sauced) there with pita chips and queso. The food was cold, but hey, it's a sport bar. But after eating all of that, I began to gag once I was 90% done. Thinking this was normal, I just held it down and kept socializing with my friends. After that, I went home, went to sleep, and I was woken up in the middle of the night with a BAD case of a bacteria-induced food poisoning infection, in which I am still recovering now. For those who have never experienced it, it's like getting hit with a hammer in your stomach with your arse h*le on fire as well, along with the feeling of digesting glass. I will never trust their food again or buy any food from Buffalo Wild Wings. They should be held responsible being a professional food chain. Safety standards should be higher. Disgusting and sickening, literally. Forgive me for being PISSED."}
{"text":"Love these wings!! Mango habanero and spicy garlic are delicious. Potato wedges are yummy too. You kinda get hooked with this place. Always available, open 24/7. Never fails.  ps: stay away from the \"blazin'\" sauce!!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving wings so I decided to try this location. It looks very nice, the wings were average to less. The women's room was dirty like deep down dirty. The sinks even looked like they needed scrubbed bad.  I usually went to the Metro Center location. The wings, cleanliness and everything is way better."}
{"text":"So disappointed.   Let me start by saying I was so stoked!! Wings place for my husbands birthday - what could go wrong?  We went on a Wednesday, assumed they had a wing night (nope, its Tuesday and only for boneless )  Was promptly greeted by the hostess who had to check the bar for us , waited 10 minutes for her to tell us, yes theres room (and when we were seated noticed there were only 2 other tables occupied which kinda annoyed us).   The hostess asked us if it was our first time and it was so she did the flight attendant style pointing out where the washrooms were and the station to buy sauces.  After being seated did not have to wait long to get our drinks ordered (ponytail waiter was very nice). Not soon after we ordered appatizers which came out right away  was disspointed with the soft pretzels - were not very soft or warm.   ordered our meals and waited. waited. waited. No refills, no drinks offered. After an hour our waiter comes over to us and says he forgot to punch in our meal and that it will be out shortly.... ahhhhh nice to self admit and not hide what you did , but really.... there were people at 3 of the tables..... pathetic!  Our bills come and he didn't take anything off for the wait, I said to him it was my husbands birthday when we sat down and at the end reminded him again and he said \"wish I had known.....\"   Not cool. and Birthdays only come once a year - good thing we had good friends with us but still.. horrible.  Will not be back. Ever."}
{"text":"I'm getting back into Buzztime trivia after a lengthy absence, and BWW reigns over the Valley in locations to play Buzztime. I chose this location cause I was in the area and wanted to try their happy hour apps. They have $3 apps, such as mozzarella sticks & mini corn dogs. Both were excellent for the price! The bar area is huge, with gaming on one side and plenty of seating for trivia/socializing.  I don't watch sports, but you can't ignore the oversized TVs all over. Luckily, the volume was not up on them."}
{"text":"Delivered an IPA, instead of an Ale, then insisted it was an Ale.    The biggest issue though, was the persistent soliciting. For the love of Christ, I came to enjoy wings, beer, and friends not to have a tablet shoved in front of me by a waiter requesting my email and phone number.   The food was good, the atmosphere was very much like a cheaply made, pop up filled website.  Just a big old NOPE!"}
{"text":"Honestly not sure what went wrong with everyone else's experiences at this location? I LOVED mine this afternoon! Went in for lunch today as my home town Detroit Tigers were playing an afternoon game. Being from Michigan I had a lunch punch card that was full. I thought that only Michigan Franchises participated in this promotion but I came to find out that his location does as well and they honored my Michigan punch card! Food was AWESOME as well! Can't beat paying just a $1.56 for a filling lunch! Also staff was very friendly/attentive!  Will most definitely will be back in soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and friendly atmosphere. The BWW on the strip we always have to wait as they are always busy. This location is busy but not as bad. Food and drinks along with the servers are awesome."}
{"text":"The new remodel has been needed for a while. Now the place is much more clean and spacious. Service, in the past, has been mediocre however it was quite good tonight. As always food is decent but nothing amazing. Prices are a tad high for the quality. Average bar food. Mostly mass-produced domestics and nothing impressive on tap. I settle for a killians :-/"}
{"text":"giving it a five star because I come here on regular and never have had a bad experience. Waiters & waitresses are very nice and attentive. I never wait very long to get my food. This is a good place for a bunch of friends to come and have dinner any day of the week! I enjoy coming when there's a big game on, it's a fun time."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with my best friend to grab some wings and beers. We were greeted and seated right away near the bar and had a big high top table all to ourselves. The server was really nice and attentive and got our drinks and food order. She saw my friend's ID first and then she asked for mine and looked at mine for a really long time, made a face, looked at my friend and back at my ID as if I had her ID even though she just looked at my friend's ID, and that was really annoying but whatever. I'm way over 21 so I don't know what her problem was. The wings were good and nicely sauced, the fried pickles were delicious too. Overall experience was really good except the server we had needs to be a bit more professional with the whole ID checking thing."}
{"text":"I ordered a very simple to go order with 16 wings and fries.  I got home to find there were 10 wings in the box.  I called and the manager could have cared less!  He said he would 'look into it' and made no effort to remedy the situation.  It took over 30 minutes just to get the order, and it was wrong.   This restaurant excels in poor customer service!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is just alright. The vibe is kind of cool with all the tv's playing every single sport you can think of, but other than that, the place is pretty lame. I would say the staff is somewhat friendly and the food is kind of boring. I've been there quite a few times now and honestly, it's because there was nothing else open at the time.  My one upside to this place is that it is amazing for groups. I went there tonight with a group of 15 people and the waiters/ waitresses didn't skip a beat. They were always there filling up our drinks or asking us if we needed anything else. Other than that one positive note, the place is really just an average restaurant."}
{"text":"My last visit to BWW was a good one - just wanted to update my last review.  Seems like there has been a \"changing of the guard\" as there were a lot of trainee servers working the night I visited - A lot of the servers I was used to maybe had moved (by choice or not) so I would say it's a welcome change.  We opted for a bar table and still got good service along with a nice tall stella artois.  Wings came out pretty quickly and were tasty.  I don't really stray too far in the menu since my usual order involves wings of some sort, but I hear their sandwiches and other options are pretty good if you aren't in the mood for wings."}
{"text":"I'm usually a fan of BWW... but this location is super busy, which usually is a good problem to have, but the service tends to suffer.  Still trying to figure out the whole parking situation at this shopping center, but between the vexing parking lot and the mediocre service, I'm going to have to downgrade my review to 3 stars.  Yes the Thai Curry sauce is good, but is it worth the hassle of the parking lot or an unexpected LONG dinner due to waiter backups and crowds?... probably not.  I'll still keep this location on my \"go to\" wing place lists for the University Area... but I will be on the search for a hole in the wall gem that would quickly replace it on the list."}
{"text":"Recently, I've been trying to find a \"go-to\" place to watch all the craziness this football season.  There are a plethora of sports bars and places to go, but I am still searching for the place that has the perfect amount of TVs, great food, and awesome service.  This BWW is located in Rivergate, in the south Charlotte burbs.  You have to drive out, pass Carowinds, and still go a little further to reach it, but there are plenty of parking spaces... It is tucked in behind the main shopping center intersection so probably contributes to less of a crowd inside.  The staff is nice-enough, but they weren't completely slammed and busy... so I expected service to be on par (and it was).  I ended up getting a new offering on their menu.. a sampler (which now that I think about it... is probably not new - just new to me)..... So 5 wings, chili-cheese fries, cheese curds, and fried pickles.  Wings were okay.  The curds and fried pickles were good (hard to mess up anything fried)... the fries came with FRESH-CUT jalapenos WITH seeds... so each fry bite ended up being a fun game of \"am I going to feel my tongue after this\" but we survived.  We had a little one with us (yes my friends have offspring now) so they were accommodating and luckily, she was very good that afternoon having a nice long nap before we headed out to watch football.  Overall this BWW is just like all the rest of them... lots of seating inside and out (large outdoor patio with lots of TVS as well).  Would I come back to watch games here?  Probably... I like a relaxed atmosphere for the most part - except I would be the crazy fantasy football guy yelling at multiple tv's for no apparent reason."}
{"text":"I admit I have a thing for Chicken Wings and BWW is the best chain for them that I've found. I especially like their hotter sauces.  Service is always quick here if your order wings. It's nothing fancy so expect to receive your wings, fries and celery in paper containers. You can normally order your wings in groups of 5 unless there's a special on wings and then there's no limit on the number.  The wings are small here but they are always hot and tasty. They also have boneless wings.  Service is average. Your waiter or bartender often disappears and you have to flag them down. But it's a chain restaurant. It's just a job for some people and that's usually fine. I just come for the wings."}
{"text":"Service was okay. Our server did check on us from time to time & refilled our drinks when needed as well. But it wasn't outstanding where it left an impact on me. But it wasn't all that bad either. Food was fresh & perfect. I had an order of the Nacho Burger (first time trying it) & it was everything I expected it to be."}
{"text":"I definitely love their wings! The buffalo sandwiches and wraps are also some of my favorites too, along with the potato wedges. Sure, they can sometimes be a bit slow, but it's worth it to me. I also get a kick out of playing trivia while I wait, or watching tv on their dozens of screens. Overall, not bad. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"If you want to watch a game, this particular Buffalo Wild Wings is a good bet. Compared to sitting in a dark casino where they pump in oxygen to keep you stimulated, Buffalo Wild Wings is a much better environment! The service here was very friendly, the prices weren't marked up for the Vegas market, and the location was great as well.  I recommend this over a casino bar, hands down."}
{"text":"What a horrible place to celebrate a special night! Kim the waitress is a snob! Just leaves you sitting for 20 minutes with no checking back to see how your meal is. This is UNACCEPTABLE! Customer service sweetheart. Learn it! Worst service ever and she has no right serving the public! Felicia the manager has no idea how to run a restraunt. It's no surprise that this location has MANY 1 star reviews on their own Facebook page. And believe me, 1 star is being generous Trust me......go ANYWHERE else!"}
{"text":"Came here at 10:30 pm after doing a nighttime half marathon. Exhausted and hungry this was the only place left open.  We walked in and were immediately seated by the host. Then 5 minutes went by without a single server greeting us. There were two walking around cleaning but no one even bothered to say hello.  In frustration we went to the bar. The bartender seemed mildly busy with a half full bar too. She greeted us much more quickly and I let her know we were ready to order after waiting in the dining room.  We then waited twenty five minutes to get our food. When we asked about it they said they were waiting on the fries. When we finally got it, no apology for the long wait. Her service was dry and lacking personality but I think a lot was due to the numerous to go orders we saw that were missing or wrong.  The manager seemed more content to walk around talking to off duty staff then help solve the problem.  It was a very bad experience and truly the last time we will go to a bww."}
{"text":"Although we live near a closer location, this is our favorite buffalo wild wings in town. Service is always great and no problems with the food. I always get a large order of boneless."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Awesome happy hour and food! I can overlook the dirty bathrooms once in a while."}
{"text":"Without a doubt this IS the location for BBW... Friendly staff, fast, efficient, AWESOME wings, they have never screwed up my order... unlike the other locations..... No other location can beat this one.  I always stuff myself here and feel terrible for about a week after!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waitress came by our table twice - for our order and then for our drinks. We didn't see her for another 50 minutes and when we finally went to ask why we didn't receive our appetizers or our food, they notified us that the appetizers were ready but the food would be another 45 minutes. She didn't even think to notify us.... Keep in mind this was on a regular, not-so-terribly busy night. Service sucked and can't even tell you about food because we weren't about to wait another hour. Not going to come back."}
{"text":"It is rare nowadays to get phenomenal service. We just had the best waitress ever. Nicole was prompt, friendly, genuinely cool person. She had several tables and took excellent care of everyone she even busted tables. It was over the top when she changed the trash at the server station a never let our glasses go empty. This place rocks."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is not somewhere I usually choose to go.... I ended up there today by default- my coworker's choice! I ordered the boneless wing lunch combo, the wings were average, but my fries were cold! Our service was decent.  Overall- an ok experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were torn on where to go for a bite to eat and have a casual nite out.... and we decided Buffalo Wild Wings- this was a great choice! We had a fun time! We sat at the bar and Jason was our bartender/waiter, he was great! We had great conversation, and then my boyfriend and I were able to play the silly trivia game they have and enjoy some good competition. The food was good, but chicken wings are their specialty here- so they know how to make them!"}
{"text":"Wow...service was eh...and it wasn't that busy...but it is a holiday so we figured we would try it out...we ordered drinks and had to wait like 10 or 15 minutes to place a food order...food came...and wow...my burger was cold and still rather raw...his salad was yellow her wings were cold and eh to say the best...additional the silverware was really water spotted and the glasses had spots too...I'm really not one to complain but all in all wow...and no I won't be back..."}
{"text":"The summer sampler is enough food to feed two people, though not if you're each really hungry. I split one with a friend and we enjoyed it. We got boneless wings (mild), fries, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks. If you're in the mood for wings and sides I think this is a great way to go :) All our food was hot and served quickly after we ordered. Our server was very kind as well and was very personable. This location wasn't to busy when we visited, so we were able to enjoy our food and the softball tournament airing. Definitely one of the better locations I've been to!"}
{"text":"My first time here, greeter was friendly, full of flat screens everywhere, I guess sports bar type of place but kid friendly. The prices are decent, food is good... got honey BBQ wings, medium and a side of fries, everything came hot and fresh. My waiter Christian was friendly and helpful, overall a good experience, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"60 cent boneless wings Thursday!  Our waitress was really nice and always checked up on us. I love getting mild because it's not too hot and not to plain. Pairing chicken with celery and ranch as well as french fries is always a great combination.  I like this buffalo wild wings because it's in a good area near the mall."}
{"text":"I like this buffalo wild wings because it's close to my work and my coworkers and I do come here from late night happy hours.  The bar tenders are great. Sometimes it sucks when it gets a little too busy, but other than that they do their job well!  The boneless wings have been quite crunchy the past few times I've ordered them, but still good.  Love the bahama mama and lemon drop shots!  Definitely a place to come if you want some cheap food/drinks late night."}
{"text":"60 cent Tuesdays are always the best!!  This bww is far from me but we were in the area because we were on our way to Moapa Valley and we wanted to stop by for lunch. Service was excellent. James was an amazing server. Greeted in and out the door. Orders were taken fast and food came out quick. Also tried their lemonades for the first time. Super yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Wild Wings but this one had my stomach turning. I ordered my usual meal-- snack size boneless, mild, extra mild sauce on the side, celery, and ranch. I also ordered a knockout punch. We sat at the bar and enjoyed our time watching the football game. Right after I was done eating I was feeling sick to my stomach like I wanted to throw up, and felt the need to lay down. Not something you'd enjoy while being at a restaurant. Server also forgot my extra mild sauce, I had to ask for it again!"}
{"text":"Their service today was mediocre. They offer a \"fast break lunch menu\" with different options. Tuesdays they have 70 cent traditional wings and on Thursdays they have 70 cent boneless wings. The only downfall is that extra sauces, celery, carrots, and ranch dipping all cost extra if you do the 70 cent deals. I like to put lemon pepper seasoning on my fries. I also like to get the mild sauce because it's not too spicy, but I like to order an extra cup because I dip it in because sometimes the chicken is too dry. I usually get the same type of service from most Bdubbs."}
{"text":"My friends and I are all very big b dub fans but this was the worst experience I've ever had. We were seated and ordered our food. Shortly after a very large group of people were seated near us. We waited for about half an hour and weren't going to say anything until the giant group started to get there food before us. When we talked to the waitress she immediately came back with our food and all of it was cold. The wings, fries, and burger. We spoke to the manager and he said he'd take care of it since we didn't want to wait longer for the food to be recooked. We still ate our food which was a bad idea because all three of us ended up sick that night. And with our hour long experience we saw our waitress about three times. It was ridiculous. We will never be going back here."}
{"text":"Traditional bar fare.  Prices are a bit on the higher side for what you get.  Absolutely nothing special about the burger as it's nothing more than a mass produced patty.  Chicken wings also seem to be more commercial than they were a few years ago  when BW3's was making its way up.  Still a decent place to watch the big game, plenty of big tv's.  Average but not on my list of must visits."}
{"text":"Went to this Buffalo wild wings and we had a waitress named Amanda. She was great!! Talked to my babies so nicely and was on top of things. Never had an empty drink. Also... My \"lovely\" boyfriend left his keys on the table and she brought them to him.. then she saw he left his ring on the table as well and ran out a second time to give it to him. Thank goodness for good people. Thank you Amanda!"}
{"text":"King gave us the best customer service EVER. 11/10 recommend this location. Awesome overall."}
{"text":"The food is consistent at all of the BWW and it is good. The wings aren't cheap but the flavor is great and I like that you can split up the sauce flavor if you are sharing- one of our faves is honey BBQ. I gave this one 3 stars because of their service- it is SLOW. We went yesterday and it took about 30 minutes to get our food and then they brought out our appys with our dinner. When the \"captain\" came by to check on us we told him about this, he shrugged his shoulders. That was it.  They were out of an ingredient for a featured drink early on a Friday.  Service needs work but they are a really busy location."}
{"text":"This is the last time I let this place get me. They're inconsistent with their saucing and drink mixing. Every time I come here I get a different experience. I get very little sauce on my wings(to the point where I have to ask for a side of sauce) and a good margarita and the next time perfect sauce and a watery margarita with no salt(i ask for lots of salt). This is really close to my house but after 7 visits I can't take it anymore! Today I came to celebrate an achievement at work and had to leave before they brought me down. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Beer, chicken, tv and to-go!  There's not much more I can say about \"Bdubs\" than all your favorites wrapped into one.  Wings, fries and FRIED PICKLES!  Consistent service, great food and beer selection gives them give stars!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings fan for a long time despite this locations lack of service. If you do need to come here for food and the convince of the location don't expect any service, so save a few dollars and save your tips. Might meet nice employees but that doesn't mean anything when the overall service will be bad. Being part of the service industry management, you notice employees will be nice and expect a tip just bc of convince, but it doesn't work that way in the real world. The word sorry only means so much.  It's worth the 10 minutes drive to another  Buffalo Wild Wings. Management up to district manager  and whoever runs this location  should be embarrassed that a place like this is manage this way."}
{"text":"OMG thus place is boring. The Saucy wings are far too Saucy just gobs of sauce yoy can barely taste the chicken below. The service was slow the beer I was served was flat Nd when I finally got another one it was not much better. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday on a busy night downtown. First thing was when we walked in there was a line in the waiting area. There was no hostess and the dining room was just \"seat yourself\". So you had to periodically walk through the dining room to see if anyone left. I work in a restaurant and the fact that didn't have a hostess or even a waiter doing some hostess duties was appalling to me, especially on a busy Saturday night. When you do sit down a waitress comes clean the dishes and trash off the table but they do NOT clean it. Gross! I ordered a steak wrap (because I wanted something more filling than wings). Waited for more than 45 minutes for food then the manager comes out to our table and asked who ordered the steak wrap. I said I did and he told me the steak is frozen in the back and asked if I would order something else. We were in a hurry to go to a concert and we told him that. then he said boneless or traditional wings could be prepared right away. Even though I didn't want to eat wings before we even ordered. I ordered a snack boneless wings anyway, then the food came out a couple minutes after that. Everyone else's food came out cold probably because the kitchen staff was just waiting for the steak to defrost in the back?? This entire time we did not get checked on by our waitress so she had no idea I didn't get what I ordered. I wasn't happy with my meal. We ate fast and got the check from the waitress. The steak wrap was on the check, the waitress came back and we asked her to take it off and she put the order of snack wings on the check. No offer from her or even the manager in the first place to get my meal for free. Had to leave in a hurry so I didn't want to heckle the waitress. But if the manager had walked by again trust me I would have said something to him about a free meal.   I'd say I have standards because I work in a restaurant and at most places I'm impressed with the service of the manager and wait staff. But this place is the worst. Communication is obviously needed between the wait staff, kitchen staff and the manager. Also why didn't anyone come to me sooner to say I couldn't get the steak because it was frozen?? They need to communicate better and also the manager is incompetent. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Service here is pretty good. I like my wings boneless, atomic and honey BBQ flavors are my faves. My daughter orders from the kids menu, she likes honey BBQ and her order come with fries. We always order nachos but never finish it. Their cocktails are good as well. Come during when the wings are cheap. Its a bit packed but its always exciting, ESP. On a game or fight night, they have multiple t.v.'s and projectors on each wall.. The crowd is good. Not to mention, this place is kid friendly and he bar is an option but for me personally, I have a 6 year old and we both like the booth. They are pretty decent in their cleanliness and staff is attentive esp. when they aren't busy but it also depends on the server."}
{"text":"This was for our adopted niece's high school's Pom Pom fundraiser, they are going to the nationals competition soon.  This is not the norm for this BWW but they pulled it off very well.  No  fried chicken wings this time, but eggs, bacon, excellent waffles and biscuits. Excellent for 8$ donation.  Still 50 TV, all with great views of all the current sporting events in a very pleasant casual atmosphere.   We have been here before and it's seems for another fund raiser.   This restaurant is noted for its community involvement, but that is Gilbert for you, small town, big hearts.  Go Gilbert, go Perry High"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick couple of wings and some ice tea. The waitress took our order and sent it off to the kitchen. When the server came out with our order it was completely wrong. The manager came out and did an excellent job of making everything correct and even took 15% off the bill. I like Buffalo wild wing, and I was pleased to see that the manager has the ability to correct things. We are a loyal customer and will continue to go to Buffalo wild wing at McQueen and Elliot!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and so was the food as usual. Our waitress was Crystal and she was super knowledgable about the gluten free options. Having celiacs naturally makes me uncomfortable and untrusting of most restaurants fearing that I will be sick and in pain. Crystal helped reassure me of the ingrediants and ensuring I was going to be okay. Needless to say the service was great and I will absolutely be back. Thank you crystal."}
{"text":"I eat here every once and a while.  It's not too far from where I live and sometimes you just feel like some wings.  Now in terms of wings, I would ranks this place as average.  I've gone to a wing joint in Cali called Wing Nuts and their wings are far better.  Service is good, fun at times depending on who you get.  The bar has a decent selection of drinks. (Edit:  Now corp owned, the drink selection has shrank)   The food normally comes out quickly.  I tried to work my way up the heat scale and got almost to the top.  However, my efforts were wasted one night when I drank too much and had spicy chicken sitting in my beer filled gut all night.  Let's just say that my esophagus has never been the same.  That pretty much ended my spicy food career.  On some nights the music gets a bit loud and you have to yell at your buddies to converse.  But all in all it's a good spot to get some wings if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Poor experience over the course of 3 visits.  Staff is friendly however they do not seem to be focused exclusively on customer service, as their personal conversations amongst each other appear to take priority.  Orders take much too long to arrive, wings are soft and void of any crisp,and  food is  over priced and lacks a developed value.  On a positive note, the GM offered to make an attempt to remedy the situation which I have yet to take him up on."}
{"text":"This is the closest Buffalo Wild Wings to me so I do not go to another often. Most of the time I get take out from here but have eaten inside a few times. I know to take a jacket because every time I eat inside it is freezing inside. However the service is typically pretty good and the food is decent. My complaint is about the take out service. It is horrible! I always sit and wait for my order for about an extra 10-15 minutes!! It is never ready by the time I arrive. Even if I order it an hour before. I also always ask for well done Wings and most of the time they aren't well done and are barely cooked when ordering takeout. Not pleased and probably won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Terrible! Terrible!  This is the third time we've ordered take out only to get home and find our the chicken is undercooked and disgusting.  The manager attempted to make things better for one order by giving us a credit so we tried again, only to be disappointed again.  No more.  They are too expensive to receive a meal to undercooked to eat!"}
{"text":"BWW has maintained its standard over the years I've been with them.  Classic sports bar look with great friendly service.  Although the kitchen messed up our order, but Tyler made a speedy recovery and provided excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I feel a bit odd reviewing a Buffalo Wild Wings, but my foreign friends always want to go when we are in Vegas and we always go to this location.    If you've been to Bdubs before it's pretty standard fair, lots of tvs and wings and other fried foods.  The only real difference is this one is open 24 hours, which is nice.    Not surprisingly if you are going here for a big sporting event it will be very busy, especially if it is a UFC fight.  You will probably have to get there an hour or more early and/or tip someone heavily to get a seat.  Best things are the mini corn dogs and wings.  If you order just those you will have a very pleasant meal.  Sauces depend on your taste and spice tolerance but I normally go with Spicy Garlic and Asian Zing.  My two British friends routinely spend 100 dollars between them, so I'm pretty sure if anyone ever decided to open one of these in London it would be like printing money."}
{"text":"Worst worst worst Bw3's we have ever experienced. Consistently poor service and food wait time regardless of the day or hour. Can't even get a drink refill during the hour and a half wait for the food that comes out after obviously been sitting under hot lamp for some time. Sad because we love BW3's but this place is awful every time. Only giving a star because it's required."}
{"text":"our waitress ashlyn is awesome! she went out of her way to give us good service even though the people on the table next to us were rude to her!! her service was prompt and enjoyable. food was decent, but the service is whats gonna bring us by again!"}
{"text":"From reading the other reviews I was kinda sad! I have Been going to this Bww for 3 years now and I have always enjoyed it!   UFC fight nights are always fun just gotta get there early! Tuesday and Thursday are wing nights!"}
{"text":"We all have things in our lives that we gravitate towards when it comes to comfort food depending on your mood and frame of mind at the time ....mine is I love Wings .....all kinds.. all shapes and sizes ..Mmmmmmm......wait ....what was I talking about ....oh yeah wings...but yep I love the Sweet Hot type and Jammin Jalapeno are my absolutely must have's..!! Now with that said ............................ Sadly..... Buffalo Wild Wings (at this location) is borderline Good.... it's only getting 2 stars because it takes friggen forever and the value for what you get vs cost is high in my opinion. I know what your thinking how can I make such a crazy statement like this one. Well its because I have spent many, many Car Club meetings most Sundays here and the average time for just 4 to 5 people that are eating something is about 45 minuets.!!..crazy right ..You would think OMG we have 15 or more people in our party ..nope only we average 7 maybe 8 at times but even then our wait times where around 25 minuets at the longest so whats changed ?? I know your probably thinking well its slammed and their backed up right ! Nope on average where there at around 3 to 3:30 pm and the place has always been way less than half full every time at best.( I'm really a glass is half full kinda guy ). so why the long times to get your food I still don't know. Anyway I'm really not trying to slam this place because its supposed to be about the food right ?? On a positive side when we did get the food its always hot and usually correct without a hitch.. So yes its Good just not the wow factor and when you add in the time it takes with the cost vs value ...sorry guys ...2 stars this time ... I'm sure I'll try it again hoping for a better result's next round...again...."}
{"text":"You know when you're craving for some hot wings or just wanna some midnight snacks or something, this is the place to be.  Hubby and I loves to play trivia on here, it's actually fun!  My top favorite here is there is CHOCOLATE CAKE!!! I It's really good! But just AVOID ordering it TO GO, because they can be sneaky and dishonest, last time we ordered 2 cakes to go, and they put a very thin slice! Like half the size of how they normally serve on the table I am so disappointed!!! So, lesson learn: Check your order first, if everything is right.  And also, sometimes you don't get very lucky here with their servers..you know what I'm talking about? Some people that don't give quality service, just working to earn,..you know, servers that don't deserve a tip kind of people? I love to see people that works so hard and provides quality service, because they dont just work to get paid, but they have passion for their job whatever it is, cares for their customers and of course for the welfare of the company they're working. Enthusiasm and passion is they key, so when you encounter an amazing server, he got that quality!"}
{"text":"Best buffalo wild wings location in las vegas--on strip or off.  The bartender, Matt K, took excellent care of us.  Absolutely a cool dude and made sure our Guinnesses were never empty.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I've visited this location a handful of times, and each time has been a fine experience. The most recent time, though, I would give a 4 star rating for the food, but the extra star is specifically for our server, MS. Nelson. She was fantastic!    It was pretty busy while we were there, lots of college football games going on. We sat in the bar section and chose our own table. MS. Nelson greeted us right away. Her fun and sassy attitude was perfect. She was attentive and checked on us often, but was at no point overbearing or a nuisance. All too often a busy environment can bring out the stress in servers, and I totally get that! It's a tough job! But MS. Nelson was cool and collected, and pretty funny too!   The food was good. It always is. We tried the mini corn dog appetizer, SO YUMMY. Whatever the sauce was that comes with those corn dogs, it was spot on. We ordered wings as well and the portion sizes were big enough we had leftovers to bring home. Score!   Overall, BWW is a good spot for wings and football, it always has been. I like going and I will continue going. But the servers are who make a visit great. Kudos!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place a low review based on how the TV system is wired. I don't know who designed it but he/she should be fired. Basketball and baseball are not the only \"American sports\" anymore (unless you're some hick town) wire your system so that you can accommodate your customers by sections! If a basketball game is playing at the same time that a soccer game is, you should be able to divide your crowd based on their preference. They kept switching the sound from one game to the other and ultimately basketball won. I am holding my table with my last beer of the night with an hour and a half to go until the end of the USA vs Ecuador game. Get with the times! Come on now..."}
{"text":"I came here with my Fiancée late night and sat at the tables by the bar. It was not to busy but then it picked up really quick. Amy was Awesome. Although she was super busy she was still nice and didn't forget anything. Service was a bit slow but I completely understand. She had like a million tables on her own.  She was able to handle it. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Love coming here to just hang out and chill the food is good service  is good for the time spent in here the deserts are amazing and my brother loves the lob board beers ...!!!!!"}
{"text":"I would right a review for the food but never got to eat anything because I've been here for a hour and haven't got my salad and wings I ordered!! It's just lettuce and chicken why is it that hard"}
{"text":"I'm not hugely into sports, but I go there with friends to hang out and have a good time. We all like wings and BBQ so this place is popular and we take over the couches and coffee table whenever we can and watch off the TVs and chill out after a long day and watch what's on.  The food there is good, pretty average but not necessarily disappointing! I really like the honey BBQ wings and ribs combo - the ribs are separated and come with lots of fall-off-the-bone meat. The ranch and celery served is fresh and compliments the food we get. My boyfriend has ordered the Bacon burger there and he was really happy with it when he got it and ate it pretty fast! Good drinks (nonalcoholic) and the tea isn't bad!  I like the servers there - never met one who was inattentive or unfriendly. We can usually strike up conversation with them, and if we ask if they can change a channel for us, they have always complied willingly. We tend to visit during the off-hours so there's not much of a crowd there. Whether its family or friends, this place caters to what we wanna do - eat well and have fun!  On a final note, the bathrooms always look clean and have TVs with the game playing, so you never miss a beat or play!"}
{"text":"How much more can they raise their prices and lower their wing count? 18 wings for over $20!  And most of them were tiny and dried out, like chicken jerky. And they also don't have wing Wednesday's any more either. Time to rethink where we go for wings."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of weeks back to meet a group of Yelpers for beer, wings, and football.  The location worked for everyone, I'm not sure we picked it because we thought BWW was anything amazing, it was just convenient and met our criteria.   I have been to multiple BWW's many times and I just do not like them.  Service is always mediocre, no matter how busy or slow.  Our server on this occasion was actually a cutie pie and was very good natured as some of the boys at our table were flirting and joking with her and even as worn out as the poor thing was, she still interacted and had fun with them.  My complaint (having been a server before) is the way they had servers assigned to tables.  She not only had inside tables, but the patio as well.  When it is busy like this they need to be more strategic about assigning sections to servers so they are not constantly running.  The needs of the customer are bound to get neglected and their staff is going to be ragged not even halfway into a very long football Sunday.   This time around at BWW I had the fried mushrooms with a house salad.  I can honestly say these are probably the worst fried shrooms I've ever had.  Extremely doughy with a mushroom the size of a button inside.  Yuck.  The salad was far from fresh.  The lettuce was obviously wilted and that was pretty much all there was to it with the exception of a cucumber or two and some tomatoes.  I tried a friend's boneless wings and thought the meat was dry and there was not enough sauce.  I like my wings drenched in saucy yumminess.   The reason I give this place two stars is I discovered a new beer that I am a big fan of. Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat.  Make sure you ask for an orange garnish.    Am I a fan? No.  Would I come back and just drink beer for the pleasure of good company? Yes."}
{"text":"It wasn't too packed on the Wednesday night that I went. Overall I wasn't blow away.  I got the spicy garlic wings. They were a decent size for what I paid for. I got the single and it was enough to fill me up. I didn't really enjoy the hot sauce they used for the spicy part. It was reminiscent of vinegar.  They had a promotion going on where for $14 I believe you could get a Moosehead beer in a stein that you get to keep so that was pretty neat.  I don't think I would be going here unless it was for a friend's birthday or a dinner with friends. The waitress was nice and got everything right so that was good."}
{"text":"Service: our server was flustered with too many tables and we felt like a burden when we asked her for a refill of celery sticks.   mango-spicy: very spicy and good garlic asian: not as spicy jerk chicken: not spicy at all!!  Overall very good buffalo wings, though they could just throw in more celery sticks.  2X celery refills =$1.20 seriously???  Beware. You will get charged for extra celery sticks even though a stalk of celery is less than a buck each."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes and saw multiple white families and couples served and never got waited on. Will never go to this Buffalo Wild Wings again."}
{"text":"SO many TVs!   Nice lay out and pretty tasty menu. The prices are a bit high, but the wings are delicious."}
{"text":"Very rude staff not worth the money or the time waiting for a table our party of six went to Zipps to eat and watch a ballgame without waiting 45 minuets for and table"}
{"text":"My family of six came to have dinner and we received the Worst service ever, the place was empty and they ignored us, it was very disrespectful. I spoke to the manager in charged and he looked like he didn't care. I will never be going there again!!"}
{"text":"This was our \"Plan B\" when the restaurant of choice was overbooked. It was nice to be seated within minutes. The sports book like ambience was awesome! (Why doesn't Hawaii have this type of set up?!)   Our server, like many, was young. She was attentive and brought our food out in a timely manner.  My Top Shelf margarita was sweet--so syrupy. Disappointed for the amount that we paid for the drink.  In the end, the food was good and atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"Went to watch game 3 of world series on sat afternoon. Had to complain to manager just to get game on 1 tv, they had espn college football news on 7 screens , got game on 3 bad viewing screens from bar area. Other 7 ppl watching world series left during 4th inn to go elsewhere to watch.  Service was good but this is world series."}
{"text":"The wings were delicious, the sauces are good which made the wings really good. The service was really great, we got to sit at the bar and was provide a one on one service. There wasn't much oil or grease on the wings. The fries were really good, and the ranch made it even better. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Love going here with my family. Great service, good food, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"The only positive thing I can say is the food tasted ok. We called ahead to see if it was busy and they said they weren't busy and there was no wait. Get there 10 minutes later and all of the sudden it's a 35 minute wait. We let them know we had 3 kids and needed a highchair, but they sat us at a table where we couldn't have a highchair. The hostess went to see if she could find a table and after a few minutes took us to a new table. Once there, are drink order was taken, appetizer were ordered, and then it was 15 minutes before the waitress came back take our order. When appetizer arrived one had to be sent back and took forever to get back. Then we waited for 30 minutes after the appetizers were killed before our food arrived. The kids orders were wrong, but they were starving at this point and didn't care. One of the adult meals was wrong also and when we asked the guy who brought them out to take it back he got really annoyed and glared at my friend. So overall service sucked, the bathroom were dirty and gross, and they don't have enough parking. If you're wanting some good wings save yourself the time & headache and go to Wing Stop down the street."}
{"text":"The wings are good,  nachos disgusting those comments are from prior experiences. What inspired me to write was my experience last night.  I was there last night for a few beers and the place was a  pigsty. Trash on the floor, dirty  napkins everywhere, tables dirty. I did not thing that was acceptable. It was as if mom and dad were gone and the kids at play. Also smelled like feet. Will not be going to the Westgate location again."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and food. It can get very expensive in a hurry. However, everything else is good. TV, beer, wings, and friends. That's about as good as it gets to me."}
{"text":"Cool waitstaff, not the BEST menu but great drinks menu if you drink, easy place to hang out and eat and just chill. Food is hit or miss-you need to find what you like and it is trial and error. Once you have \"your foods\" stick to them."}
{"text":"Service was great but their prices went up. Also before I went there I checked the prices on line so when I got my check the price wasn't what I expected ..a medium order of boneless wings was listed on line for 10.49 and large for 14.99 but now it's 14.99 for a medium order of wings ...Manager said he was sorry but did nothing ...14.99 is too much for a order of wings ..I should have paid the price that was advertised"}
{"text":"Love this place! Sometimes the service is slow, but it's always clean and a great place to watch sports!"}
{"text":"This place can be a real crapshoot.  Somedays the wings are excellent and some days they come out horrible.   More often than not the wings are above-average but that's not saying much. I wish I could give it more stars."}
{"text":"Order through doordash....husband and I both got burgers. My fried chicken was nasty and soggy. My husband ordered a regular cheese burger with bacon his order wasn't hot at all and lacked flavor. We will never give BWW another try. NEVER!!!!"}
{"text":"We normally dine in but this place always gets so crowded. Great place to watch games! Food is amazing and great service! I love their wings and cheesecake bites! When ordering to go, it normally takes 25-35 minutes. This is our go to place when cravings for good wings!"}
{"text":"Put in a take out snack order of wings, I was told 20 min. An hour later still nothing. Absolutely no communication with this place. They used to be really good."}
{"text":"I always have a good time at this place. I am a regular and love coming to this location. Not only is it close to my bungalow, but the bartenders are normally on point. I normally come after 12 am and Mike has always given great service.   I am always weird about giving reviews to big franchises like B Dubs cause everyone knows what to expect. This particular location does not have a host stand so I normally seat myself where ever I see fit. A waiter normally comes around. Seating at the bar calls for faster service of course.   The cheese curds are so good! If you haven't had those, you need to order them right now! Anyways, just another B Dubs!"}
{"text":"Best service I have EVER had at a Buffalo Wild Wings. Charlie, our server greeted us immediately and always made sure we were okay. Food and beer came out fast. Never have I ever had a good experience at a buffalo aside from sitting at the bar. Thank you Charlie!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports... food is horrid...it's all fried in beef tallow... you should look up what that is... or maybe not if you're gonna eat here... basically this is all cheap fried garbage.... I must say the Hot BBQ sauce is off the hook... otherwise just get some McDonald's and PPV the UFC event...."}
{"text":"BWW is one of my fave spots for happy hour! It's always busy and the service is not so bad.  They check up on you often even in the free seating area.  The wings are ordinary but what makes it special is their sauces.  My personal faves are the garlic, hot and asian zing.   Wing nights are Tuesday and Thursdays (50 cents per wing).  Have fun!!"}
{"text":"Please train your bartenders how to pour a Guinness. I choose it, and pay the price, for a reason. Please respect it instead of treating it like a common domestic."}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the past few years with friends usually for big sports events. Never a previous problem and a good time with friends, drinks and food. Took the wife here last Wednesday for dinner and very bad visit. We arrived and got seated at a high top in the bar area. Ordered a beer for myself and a soft drink for the wife. When they arrived ordered fried pickle app, boneless wings for myself and regular lemon peppered wings for the wife. Asked the waitress to make my wife's wings extra crispy, please cook them longer for very crispy. Food arrived and the lemon peppered wings were not crispy and sent them back. I was almost done eating after 20 minutes and I asked the waitress about my wife's wings and she said she'd check....grr. They arrived at 27 minutes and the were crispy alright, but also drenched in lemon pepper seasoning, quite excessively. The wife ate one, looked at me and said try one. They were not eatable. Asked for the bill, paid it with a smaller then normal tip (really didn't want to punish the waitress) and left. My wife had stomach problems and diarrhea the next two days. Seems the cook might have an attitude and to trash her wings because she sent them back, seems the cook needs a different line of work. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Ohio state bar in Arizona. Nice. So if I ever move out here I know there are enough Clevelanders to hang with.  The service was great and the captain morgan special wing sauce was sweet with enough hotness to bring some heat but not burn me down.  It replicates memories of hanging out watching the 2007 Indians eating wings and drinking beer.  The place is great for families, couples, or buddies hanging out trying to relive the good ole days.  Boneless wings were good.  I still prefer traditional bone in wings."}
{"text":"Sonia the bartender was amazing she helped me out with my order. called at 12am to put my order they told me I had to walk in and she pushed my foot was really in no more then 15 mins  50 wings and cheese cake bites"}
{"text":"This is where I come when I'm craving cold beer and flaming hot wings.   I just can't seem to resist Buffalo wings and every time I come here, I order the mango habanero wings. I can barely stand the heat, but the flavors are out of control yum. They're my favorite.   I try to come when they have their weekly specials, but I honestly don't come half as often as I'm tempted to.   This location is open 24 hours, which is pretty bad a$$!    Bring on the heat."}
{"text":"Mango Habanero wings are my guilty pleasure here.   We don't really frequent Buffalo Wild Wings, but during football season the place beckons us. It's one of the only places I can convince my fella to go during the day on a Sunday. They obviously have great football viewing as well and a huge variety of wing flavors. My fella always goes for the spicy garlic and I order the mango habanero and a large cup of water.   The service is really attentive and friendly which is impressive since they get so busy.   Definitely a great place for sports viewing and spicy wings, 24 hours a day."}
{"text":"Very standard Buffalo Wild Wings location. I have experienced both good and bad service here, so it's hit or miss. On our most recent visit, the service was good and they kept the drink refills coming, which is key when I kick up the spice level."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour and I can't say I'll go out of my way to go back.   The mixed drinks were mixed poorly and the service was spotty. We ordered wings and some drinks and I didn't really like anything. The sauces weren't even coated properly."}
{"text":"This was my old stomping ground good drinks and good food Wednesday night's they would have a Texas holdem tournament for a cash prize which was cool. I love it here pretty good food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good, atmosphere is great. The tablets keep kids occupied. Tonight the service was incredibly slow and the waitress was not attentive. They didn't appear overly busy or short staffed so the service really should have been better"}
{"text":"I know this isn't the restaurant where you'd expect supreme service given that it's a sports bar with a bunch of TVs, but my waitress stood a good three feet from my table and heard my order wrong and only came over three times in nearly three hours! I waited at least 35 minutes for a check and she hardly acknowledged I was alive. I like the food but this rubbed me the wrong way and I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my birthday. The servers were rude, and I told them it was my birthday but they just gave  us a dirty look and speech that they don't do that here. (Free small dessert) Really?? It's Vegas  I used to love coming here but the drinks tasted like juice and we were given an attitude by the bartenders who were serving us. We gambled over 20 bucks and because of that we should have been comped a free drink. Instead they gave an attitude and refused to comp us. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and that is enough for me.  I'm not sure why it is BWW's staple to have terrible service at every location they have, but it is.  It's always the same thing, waiting over an hour for your food to come no matter what time of day, and then receiving mediocre at best bar food.  Find yourself another sports bar.  It's sure to be better than this chain and this location."}
{"text":"I had the unfortunate experience of going here multiple times, but no more.  The restaurant can be mostly empty and the food takes over an hour to come.  It's bar food.  It really shouldn't take that long.  Especially with businesses around, you would expect they don't have an hour to wait just until the food comes, never mind eating it and then waiting for the waiter again to run the bill.  I'm not even sure how it can take as long as it does.  There are plenty of other places to go to that have 10x faster service and a dozen TVs."}

{"text":"This was a total disappointment! My friends and I needed a late night meal after rehearsal. It was 5 of us and I placed my takeout order first. I was told it would take 15-20 minutes so we went to the bar to get a drink. Sat there for 10 minutes and no one ever acknowledged us. So I go back up front to wait.   My order - bacon cheeseburger with potato wedges. The menu said all burgers were cooked medium well.   40 minutes after placing my order and everyone else had their food. I requested a refund. The server checked on my order and brought it out. My burger was well done and there were French fries instead of potato wedges. While he went to get my wedges, my anger increased and I requested the manager to get a refund.   We also witnessed seated customers have to see the manager to get someone to take their order. Additionally, there were multiple empty tables that weren't bussed. Tables that were that way for the entire 45 minutes we were there.    I come to Cleveland once a year and always stay in this area. I know never to come here again."}
{"text":"The Thai curry wings were good and very large but everything else was standard bar style food. Pullanos wings are better and worth the extra few miles to drive for."}
{"text":"We're regulars here but for the past 2 months the service has been horrible. We've waited over 15 minutes to be greeted while we've already been seated and then once you place the order it takes forever for your food to come out. This will be the last time we will come to this location."}
{"text":"Walked in and walked out.   Stood at the hostess podium for about 10/15 minutes on a Monday afternoon. Not very busy, but was not greeted or acknowledge. Waitresses walked by and ignored us.   I'm sorry but if I'm standing there at least acknowledge me and say, I'll get someone with you shortly, but no we stood there like fools. Would not give this place a second chance. Especially because they were not busy."}
{"text":"Not my favorite B-dubs but if you are really having a fried-food craving it's decent enough to stop in for a visit."}
{"text":"I've been eating buffalo wings for years, I got a feather on one of my chicken wings. In my entire 15 years of eating wings I have never gotten a feather on a wing before.  I sent for the manager to come out and he said \"it happens all the time here\" apparently feathers may be on any of your wings and this was not an isolated incident.  We did end up receiving a 25% discount on the whole order so not all was negative but I will not be going to Buffalo Wild Wings any time soon. Feathers just gross me out too much."}
{"text":"Well after being a WINGSTOP fan and finally trying this place. It's eh...mas o menos...just ok. The environment is very engaging, they had a raffle to give away jerseys which was cool. But the food was mediocre. Staff were funny and attentive and by staff, I mean bartenders. Big screens everywhere which is what I liked and happy hour was good especially when its Monday Night Football and its an early game. But if I really want wings I'm gonna have to go to my favorite. Sorry B-dubs!"}
{"text":"Went in for a late dinner on a Saturday Night and was surprised that it was not busy. Less than half filled.  Service was good and with the waiter there to fill our drinks without having to ask.  Unfortunately it took a long time to get our food at least 20 plus minutes when it was slow and we ordered a salad, deep fried mushrooms and 10 wings.  The wings were good size with a lot of meat. I can say so long to Native Grill with their ever shrinking sized wings.   The deep fried mushrooms were small and dry and disappointing.   The chicken salad was good size and looked fresh with a small amount of chicken.   I will come back for the wings but skip the deep fried mushrooms."}
{"text":"Pretty average wing place. Considering they specialize in wings, I was a little disappointed in their somewhat limited choice in sauces and rubs. I'm a sauce girl myself so I was also disappointed that Buffalo was a rub not a sauce! Tuesday nights were $0.75 wings with minimum 4 per flavour. Added up quickly but wings were a decent size. Wings did not come with the carrots and celery like usual. For a chain wing joint, I would probably stick to St Louis cause their fries and dill dip are bomb."}
{"text":"It's a nice spot. Been here 3 times now and I can't complain to much. Got sat right away around dinner time each time. Every time we went all 3 waitresses where great. Took a little long to get drinks one time and to go boxes another but other then that great place to eat out with your family and or buddies."}
{"text":"BWW has been a regular eat-out place for me and my friends the last 3 years of college. Food is always great, I came to know of tenders day (Wednesday, 1$ tenders) too late coz we always just got the wings! Do try their tenders, dipped in parmesan garlic sauce and plain. Asian zing and mango habanera are my personal favorite sauces on wings. Potato wedges are amazing. Servers are courteous. IMAX is right next to it too so that's an added bonus."}
{"text":"Will they EVER learn. After multiple poor reviews of the kitchen and conversations with the managers, NOTHING ever changes. I went there again Tuesday (3/22/16) before a Coyotes game. We ordered 4 appetizers, Loaded Chips, Mushrooms, and 2 orders of Street Tacos. The first 2 came out in @15 minutes, but after 45 minutes (and multiple apologies from the waitress) we finally had to say forget it to the Street Tacos and leave for the game. They need to either fire or retrain the kitchen staff and replace the kitchen manager, who clearly has no clue and apparently doesn't care since this has been an ongoing problem. Does the GM have a clue either?"}
{"text":"Not kidding, it took 90 minutes for my group's (uncomplicated, many orders of wings) food to come out tonight, with the restaurant half empty.    I know it's a wing joint, so everything on the menu is gonna be hella greasy / spicy / cheesy, and I am completely down with eating greasy / spicy / cheesy food, but my boneless honey bbq wings and cheese fries were just completely bland piles of oil, no flavor whatsoever even when doused in blue cheese or ranch dressing.    Two stars instead of one because I've had good service and good  wings here before and because of impossibly high cleanliness for a place that deals in so much oil."}
{"text":"We have large group gatherings here often for sports watching and for wireless/laptop meetings. This place is just ok, but it's close to work, the wait staff is friendly, and all is well. They're even good with my 4 year old running around."}
{"text":"Hate to downgrade my previous review, but when I told the manager (new) that I got one of those broken, bloody wings, her response was, \"There's always one!\"  What?!  Not when I go to Teakwoods or Stadium Club for wings.  They don't serve broken, bloody wings.  So, she thinks it's okay that 10% of my wings were inedible?  Now, I wasn't expecting a credit on my bill, but I would have hoped for, at least, an, \"Oh, yuck, I'm sorry.  I'll pass that along to the kitchen.\"  Her actual response was disappointing to say the least.  Overall, this place is really inconsistent.  I never know what I'm going to get.  Sometimes the wings are undercooked and snappy, sometimes they're perfectly crispy.  Sometimes the wings are coated in luke-warm, gloppy sauce, sometimes the sauce is perfect.  Sometimes they've got a good beer or two on tap, sometimes they choose some crappy seasonal instead.    One thing I can say, is the staff is almost always great, enthusiastic, and make it a fun meal.  And the owner is great.   She owns the two stores in Gilbert.  B-Dubs is a fun place, so we go there regularly despite the shortcomings. I think it's a 'chain' issue more than a local store issue.  Besides, 'Buffalo' Wild Wings is based out of Minnesota.  'Nuf said."}
{"text":"\"Niccole\" does not know how to serve and shouldn't be the one taking orders I didn't order the teriyaki and I didn't have a drink the whole order because she didn't refill my water until after the meal also after watching her serving other tables their drinks also kept the 6$ change and no receipt Had to get up to find someone not her cause she went MIA so I had to search for utensils that should've been there originally. Didn't pay attention to us the whole meal didn't check on us or ask us how it was. We watched all the other waiters be friendly and outgoing to the tables surrounding us but not our dear Niccole. I hope someone can take the time (if they can find her) to re train her if she was trained at all. Don't take it personal Niccole, we're all not good at everything."}
{"text":"There wings are terrible. Don't order pickup because they neglect to pack your food carefully. I'm not at all impressed. In fact, I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"If I have to yell my order to the server less than 2 feet away from me, YOUR MUSIC IS TOO LOUD."}
{"text":"Service is slow as always. The wings were a bit cold. They're probably left out for a while before it was served. They were very stingy with the jerk sauce on the wings and not 100% of the wings were covered with sauce. BWW is a good place to visit. Just don't visit this NASCAR HOF store unless you plan to have a 2 hour lunch."}
{"text":"The fruit flies are eating my food before I get a chance, I guess I'm getting in extra protein. I will never come back very dirty and needs Jon Taffer to clean them up."}
{"text":"WORST service that I have ever had.  It's really disappointing as I have been to BW3 at many places around the country.  The restaurant was busy but there were some empty tables.  The hostess was extremely rude, took forever to help us, and then didn't allow us to sit down at an empty table in the bar area while we were waiting for our food, even though there were at least seven empty tables.  To make things worse, another party came in and did the same and she didn't seem to care.  We eventually got our food to go and then left."}
{"text":"Third times (not) the charm! This place is bad. The food is mediocre but the service is the worst. The waitress was rude to our table and the food took forever. The service staff stand around flirting with eachother and pay little attention to customers who need drinks etc. Maybe they need a reminder that they work for tips. I hate going places that act like they are doing you a favour by bringing you out food. Won't be coming back here ever."}
{"text":"Went for wings last night.  It is a wing joint, after all.  Ordered our wings extra, super crispy.  Like 30 minutes later, they bring out rubbery chicken skin wings.  We sent them back.  Manager came over, and had the NERVE to tell us \"that's why I order boneless wings\".  Really?  You manage a wing joint, and you don't even eat chicken wings?  Boneless wings are NOT wings.  They are chicken breast. So, after ANOTHER freaking 30 minutes, they bring out our \"new\" wings.  Yup, you guessed it!!  RUBBERY SKIN WINGS!!  I told our waitress, \"bring the bill for the sodas\". So, we sat there for a damn HOUR, and they never actually got our freaking order right.  We left without eating.  They need to fire their cooks, and get someone in there that is smart enough to touch the wing, and know it's not crispy!!  And, 7 freaking dollars for two sodas!!!   It's funny too, cause on the way out, there is a sign on the door that says \"Come hungry, leave triumphant\".  HA!  B*llsh*t! It will be a cold day in hell before we go back there!"}
{"text":"Here on a postmates take out order, second time today.. let me just say Collin is doing amazing!! He's the only one working the take out counter and it's busy as hell, he's killing it!! Also appreciate how he always checks to make sure all the items are there and everything looks good with you, no matter how busy it is. Much appreciated, Collin!"}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! I came to celebrate my sister's graduation and the service here was terrible. Our table of 5 waited 15 minutes for our fountain drinks alone. We waited another 20+ minutes for an appetizer and when we asked the waitress for silverware she brought us plastic utinsils. After waiting a while longer for the food our waitress shared with the table there was a mix up with our orders and that our ticket was lost. We were at the establishment for over 50 minutes with only an appitizer and no refills on our drinks. We ended up leaving hungry   after talking to the manager. This place would be getting 1 star, but their manger showed his concern with our disappointment and made an effort to turn the night around. Nevertheless, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"This BDubs is terrible all around. Dining in and take out. Rude hostess, waitress and managers. It's always a hassle to get seated and they never get my order right. I'm always paying more for additional ranch or sauces when I order 2 large orders of Wings, I could accept the additional charge if I'd initially received at least 3 sauces already but I only get once for each order of Wings. I'm sharing wings with a large party so I should receive individual size sauces for each person. It also always stinks on the patio this is something they probably can't avoid but it's gross and makes it unpleasant to eat outside. Silverware and cups are always dirty. This place just sucks and I've been to at least 10 different BDubs here in the valley and in California and this is by far the worst one. I'll drive an extra 10 miles to go eat at the Goodyear one from now on."}
{"text":"this b dubz is the worst ever... ordered wings online and still had to wait an extra 20 minutes after the time they told me it was gonna be ready just for the manager \"AMBER\" to tell me that they didnt even start my order... this rude manager didnt have the decency to tell me sorry about my order! i didnt think she even cared that they screwed up... why even work there if you dont care about customer service! and can see why its located in the north side... bad service, bad area i guess that goes hand in hand... wheres the thumbs down in this app?"}
{"text":"Literally the worst service ever. I write this as I'm sitting in the bar area, as I have been for about 15 minutes just wanting to place a to go order and haven't even been greeted. Why didn't I just call ahead you ask? Oh I did, but I was placed on hold for longer than it takes for me to get here from my house. So as I continue to sit here, I finally got helped. Giving 2 stars just because the bartender is polite. Here's to hoping the food is good tonight & it takes less time to make than to order"}
{"text":"my friends and I came here for lunch, I got a chicken quesadilla and they brought out only cheese so I told them and they made a new one no big deal and then we asked for ranch for my friends wings the waiter came around asked if we got it we said no he said he would go and check on it and then later he brought the check and still no ranch and finally came back to get our checks and brought our ranch after all of the food was gone. the worst part is he charged me for both quesadillas, at that point I was so frustrated told him and he went and changed it and took even longer it was just a terrible lunch break."}
{"text":"Use to come here for wing Tuesdays. When it is busy expect the service to be super slow and sometimes you only see your server twice. Once for the order and once to get the check. They have a nice selection of different flavors which is nice.   Sometimes the food is fresh and sometimes it tastes like it's literally been sitting under the warmer for hours. It is a hit or a miss with the amount of traffic that is present at the time you actually go.   I usually get the honey bbq bone in wings and my husband loves spicy so he gets the mango habanero. Occasionally, he gets a burger, I believe it's the jalapeno burger."}
