{"text":"The food was great! Same great taste as the restaurant but comes right to you! Beautiful truck and excellent service! I will definitely look into booking for a near future event! Im also going to request Diego and Devin."}
{"text":"These guys catered to my work. They made artisan pizzas and half meatball subs. Service was good, a little slow, but the employees were friendly. The food truck itself looked extremely clean and well kept and one of the prettier ones I have seen. Some of the pizzas came out a little burnt but they were probably rushing to mass produce some pizzas for a hungry crowd of employees on their lunch break."}
{"text":"A Fox Restaurant Concept on wheels?  Yes, please!  Not only is this the prettiest food truck I've ever seen, but it serves some damn good food along with friendly service.  It's reliable too... I had The Rocket's pizza and salad for the first time in Flagstaff of all places.    If you like the menu at North Italia and you're looking to cater a private or corporate event for up to 300 people, give Lauren at The Rocket a call.  And then give me a call so I can plan to attend!"}
{"text":"Had a chance to experience this delicious food during #partnercon15.   The service was fantastic, super friendly, willing to make any adjustments for any order that was placed from a large crowd.  I had the fig and prosciutto which was a perfect choice. All of the ingredients were fresh and they went perfectly together. And for cooking a pizza in a truck in a wood fire oven the pizza was cooked spot on. It was simply delicious"}
