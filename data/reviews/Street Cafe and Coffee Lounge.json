{"text":"Just a fun place to eat, drink & visit and knowing that your helping children and not lining the pockets of corporations, well just awesome :-)  :-)"}
{"text":"I rarely post reviews.  But this really plucked a nerve.  I ask the barista if they had wifi which she said yes.  I ordered lunch and a coffee.  I typically order if I expect to be awhile using an establishment's wifi.  By the way, I have wifi at home but I wanted to be out.

I set up to connect to their wifi; however, it would not connect.  I ask the barista if they were having issues.  She said yes, it is slow today.  Oh you knew this prior to me asking.  I then ask if she can reset the wifi.  She comments she is unable to because it will send the printer haywire or something to that nature.

So I spent my money here then had to pack up and go spend it somewhere else as well.  Why do people go to coffee shops?  First to use their wifi or have a friendly chat, second coffee or tea.

The fish tacos were delicious."}
{"text":"So far, I love this place!  The food is delicious and very sizable for the price.  Speaking of the prices, super economical and they don't seem to change ($6 or $7!).  The staff is very friendly and recognized my bf and me from our previous visit days earlier.  To top it all off,  the restaurant is a non-profit benefiting hungry children."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best breakfast in town! I had the three cheese omelet and a black and white coffee. It was a large portion and absolutely delicious! That's not even the best part...every time you eat here you're feeding a hungry kid! What? Amazing food for you and a kid? I'm in!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. I am so happy to have found this spot. The food is consciously sourced, and the tight but well-rounded menu has seasonal considerations. The generously portioned breakfast and lunch plates are $5 and $6, respectively. The restaurant functions as a 501(c) organization meaning it is non-profit. This status allows them to provide food assistance for those in need, with emphasis on feeding hungry children. But the best part is that the food is delicious. As is the coffee. The feeling of the restaurant is welcoming and personal, but in the best way. The service is warm and I am happy to be a customer. Very much worth your time."}
{"text":"Would 100% recommend this restaurant excellent service food and a very clean restaurant!
Be sure and catch the story of how these wonderful people give back in their nonprofit organization that helps so many you're culinary experience here will be delightful and your heart will grow two sizes bigger ...thanks Alex for the great introduction to this wonderful giveback place in the world!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to support the cause but wasn't sure what to expect in regards to the food. I was pleasantly surprised. There is a variety of lunch and breakfast items as well as delicious baked goods. Prices are extremely affordable. Best way to describe the location is the SW corner of Shea and Scottsdale, next to Ernie's"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp on the way to work this morning. It had about 44 great reviews and I wanted to try it. 
I'm glad I did.
The great food I ordered was only outdone by the genuine friendly personality that Vince (one of the owners) and Jason showed.
The meal was just the right amount of food and wasn't expensive.
If your in the area for breakfast or lunch you should stop by. 
I turned that $ I saved into a donation for the kids they feed."}
{"text":"The Street Cafe is a very friendly and welcoming place to grab a really good coffee. The menu changes all the time, but each meal I've had has been excellent. $5 for breakfast and $6 for lunch is easy on the wallet. You definitely don't leave hungry. I understand they are roasting their own coffee. Also, since it's a non- profit that feeds hungry kids, the proceeds go toward that. They do catering too, which is nice to know."}
{"text":"A hidden little gem right next to another gem(Ernies). This place always serves up good breakfast for$6 or lunch $7 and the service is outstanding. And to top it all of its a non-profit group that helps people get meals!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast deal in town! $5 gets you any breakfast on the menu (and they serve it all day) and you can add a coffee for just $1 more. This was my first visit and I ordered the Southwest Benedict which was crazy delicious and super hearty and came with a side of also great hashbrowns (and I do not take my breakfast potatoes lightly). The service was also excellent-- friendly and quick. Plus, the best thing is that the cafe is a non-profit, so all the proceeds go towards alleviating hunger in Arizona communities. I'll definitely be back and hope to see you here! 

PS-- they also have a lunch menu that follows the same flat price model ($6 for any dish on the lunch menu)."}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp and decided to give it a go after seeing all the good reviews. A friend and I went for lunch on a Wednesday and were very happily surprised! It's a little hole in the wall place, but with a large variety of items on the menu and SO cheap! $5 for any breakfast meal and $6 for any lunch! Can't beat that. As a vegetarian, I had the veggie breakfast bowl. It had tempeh sausage and I genuinely thought they messed up and put sausage on my meal because it tasted like real meat. So good! My friend had the breakfast bagel and loved it as well. Will definitely go back and tell family and friends for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, with an amazing cause, and great customer service! The price is very reasonable as well. A must try when in Phoenix, AZ."}
{"text":"This place was such a surprise! It was a little bit difficult to find because the address was not very specific. But once we got there it was so worth it. They have a good variety for breakfast and lunch. I had Southwest Eggs Benedict. It was the best I've every eaten. The eggs were perfect, and the sauce had a little kick to it. Loved it! My wife had a hamburger which was huge! She said it was one of the best burgers she's had in a long while.

We also loved their mission. It made us feel even better about our choice. We definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Rad chick at the front. Cool spot. Support the community! Delicious food and coffee for $6.50. Yup. $6.50 porkchops and eggs. YUM"}
{"text":"The street cafe is a WONDERFUL Organization!!! Words cannot describe how much I love this place. 

The street cafe is a nonprofit organization who provide meals to under privileged children in the Phoenix area with all the proceeds going to the kids. 

The food is incredible and affordable. $5 for breakfast and $6 for lunch. You can be assured that everything on the menu is delicious. The menu changes every day so there is always something new and exciting. I eat here every day. 

Go try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nothing better than eating great food for a great cause! FEED DA HUNGRY KIDS. I'm here multiple days a week, never gets old."}
{"text":"Great place to meet a friend for coffee, have a work meeting/lunch or place a catering order and take it back to the office. 

Terrific coffee, great food and awesome concept. The profits go to feed hungry kids...turning hunger into hope."}
{"text":"Non profit cafe. All profits, yes all, go towards giving back to Kitchen On the Street. They have this down really well. The coffees are truly delicious. Have some original Flavors like Jedi Fizz. They serve breakfast and lunch. I had a panini and my husband had a western omelette. My panini was good but my husband's omelette was to die for. Absolutely delicious and plan to get the next time I'm in. I like that they change up the menu each week. Some favorites stay in the menu. They also have FRESH pastries for that quick grab and go.  The people who work there are polite and courteous. Vey good sense of humor!  The only complaint I can think of is the seats are not very comfortable. So staying to chat with friends or to work on the laptop is not an option for long periods of time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome !  The food and the coffee are always very tasty and fresh.  The service rocks too.  The profits help feed poor children,  I try to stop in for breakfast or lunch at least 2-3 times a week."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast and coffee this morning. The service and staff were very friendly and the breakfast was delicious. Definitely a local find and priced fairly. I will go here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food for an amazing cause. The menu is always changing as items come in to creat great eats."}
{"text":"Had the green chili and it was delicious. It's a pretty place with plenty of parking. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"small fun place to grab a quick bite. very friendly staff, great prices, tasty food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great cause and the food is reasonably priced and taste great! If you go please donate a little extra to the cause. The staff is amazing and won't accept tips."}
{"text":"Street Café is a great addition with a twist to the multitude of standard Breakfast/Lunch restaurants in Scottsdale. The café is small but very clean and attractive. It's a little hard to find but keep looking. It's just south of Ernie's on the east side of the strip center on the SEC of Scottsdale Rd and Shea. The food is terrific with service to match. We had the Alpha-Omega Breakfast Burger, Pancakes and Crispy French Toast. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the breakfasts and can't wait to return. The twist is that it is non-profit with proceeds going to fund food programs for disadvantaged kids. 

Breakfast items are $5, yes, $5, and Lunch items are $6. You get a great deal and kids who otherwise may be hungry get good food to eat. The best win-win I can think of.  

Why eat in a ho-hum Scottsdale breakfast place when you can be a part of the community and enjoy a meal with something extra!"}
{"text":"I came here for a private dinner event and it was amazing. I was unsure what to expect and was blown away. The food was amazing and it supports a great cause. My hat's off to the chef and volunteers."}
{"text":"5 stars with 61 reviews caught my attention, then I read a little bit about the foundation of the restaurant.  decided we needed to go, and we were not disappointed.  great food (green chili chicken enchiladas, for real??!!  YES please!), wonderful staff, and a great cause.  I left there full and happy we contributed to the cause.  can't wait to check out breakfast, and the gals down at Two Plates Full (another Scottsdale jem - neat gifts & pottery, etc... a few stores down) told me the burgers are the best.  two words - GO THERE!"}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for vacation and found Street Cafe on Yelp. Ended up eating several meals here during our week stay in Scottsdale. The food portion is insane and so is the price! I love that they give back the proceeds to the community. Employees were are super nice and helpful. Cute interior!"}
{"text":"I visited Street Cafe for the first time this past Friday (June 15th).  I was taken there by someone who said I would enjoy the breakfast there while at the same time I would be supporting a good cause.  Although we were there 5 minutes before opening, there were quite a number of people already seated.  This was a positive feeling in the air and I felt very comfortable there.  Don't know why that was.  
The staff came over and explained the ordering process in a most positive and friendly manner.  We ordered the \"basic\": two eggs, potatoes, toast and bacon.  Plus, we had a smoked salmon sandwich on a bagel which came with a macaroni salad.  
My \"up\" eggs were perfectly cooked and the home fried potatoes had asuper delicious flavor.  I usually leave the potatoes but these had to be eaten.  I got 4 strips of bacon with my order--yes 4--and perfectly cooked--not too crispy and not limp.  As a plus, the bacon was not salty.  Bacon usually gets saltier after cooking.  Not here.  The smoked salmon was perfection and generous.  We ordered a cup of coffee for $1 with refills.  Amazing. As I ate my breakfast, my dining companion explained to me that this cafe was a non-profit whose profits went to feeding hungry  children.  No wonder I felt so good entering this place!  Good things give good feelings.  
As we were finishing breakfast, one of the heads of the cafe told us that \"today is our last day.\"   It was shocking to me that this great place would be closed effective Friday.   Good food for a good cause.  
I hope I misunderstood her, but I think they are truly closed from now on.  I hope I am wrong.
Thank you for the wonderful breakfast in your wonderful place."}
{"text":"I've had Street Cafe bookmarked for a couple of weeks, ever since reading a positive review by one of my Yelp friends. I was surprised to find that Street is literally in the same strip as my current area favorite, Maverick Coffee!

Based on the pictures and previous reviews, I knew I wanted to swing by for a warm mug of coffee and a breakfast sandwich. The food, in particular, looked tasty and I was excited to try. I chose this morning for a visit.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS

Upon entering Street Cafe, I was warmly greeted by a woman who introduced herself as Lisa. Turns out, she's one of the owners. When Lisa learned that this was my very first visit, she made a point of getting to know me.

Lisa also took the time to tell me more about Street Cafe. She told me how the business was in place as a non-profit with a mission to help feed the hungry and teach important life skills. I had no idea of this before she told me and was VERY impressed by the concept.

Lisa then introduced me to their menu. They keep pricing simple: just $5 for the breakfast menu items, $6 for lunch. She was also excited to show me a fresh batch of organic Guatemalan coffee beans recently roasted on-site.

Naturally, I ordered a pour-over of the Guatemalan and paired that to a breakfast sandwich (the Alpha & Omega Breakfast Burger). My total came to just $6. I then found a shaded seat just outside in the European-style cafe alley.

FOOD & DRINK IMPRESSIONS

It was not long before Lisa was delivering a steaming blue mug of fresh coffee to my table. The brew was very tasty, especially for being a first run at on-site roasting! (Hopefully they still have it available when you, dear reader, decide to stop by for a coffee!)

The food was delivered shortly after the coffee and it was very tasty. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the sandwich included a side of potato cakes. (As much as I enjoyed the sandwich itself, those potato cakes were the stars of the show. Wow! So good!)

Once I had finished my food, Lisa surprised me with an icy cup full of an experimental cold brew coffee, explaining that she and the chef (her husband) would love my opinion of it. (My opinion was that it was one of the most unique and flavorful cold brews I've ever had.)

CONCLUSION

I took my time in the cool air of the alley, reading and writing and listening to music. I couldn't have felt more at home. Everything from the ambiance to the outstanding service experience to the delicious and fairly-priced food MORE than exceeded my expectations.

If you haven't been to Street Cafe yet, I cannot possibly recommend it highly enough. I have never met more dedicated and caring business owners. I left today feeling like I had made new friends, and I will definitely be back - frequently.

Thank you, Street Cafe, for being such wonderful hosts! And thank you for all that you do for your community-in-need via this inspiringly creative non-profit concept. I'll be sure to send people your way every chance I get!"}
{"text":"1st time at Street Cafe and I will be back soon! The hot chicken Florentine sandwich is so delicious and only $7 with chips and including tax! What an amazing new find close to my office! Looking forward to trying more lunch items."}
{"text":"NON PROFIT COFFEE and LUNCH PLACE!!!

I came to support the cause, and left impressed and well fed.  

Support Kitchen on the Street's mission of turning hunger into hope one child at a time by visiting Street Cafe & Coffee Lounge (10435 N. Scottsdale Road) between 7am-2pm. Breakfast = $5 Lunch = $6; average coffee is $2.50. Every purchase turns hunger into hope!

They change the menu often but I had chicken taco sliders. FANTASTIC!!!  and only $6!

This place is  a little hard to find because you cannot see it from the street. You have to go into a business complex but then it's easy to find.

I wish this place stayed open unitl midnight, but maybe in time when they get busy enough to hire more staff.

Shawn, the guy who helps run the place is one of the nicest, coolest people I know. He has so much love to give- he adds good energy to every thing he serves.

I will be back, Street cafe!!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place for good food at the best price. Plus a portion goes towards children in need. A win win and the employees are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Came across this place tucked right one the corner of Scottsdale & Shea and soooo glad I did!!! I ordered a breakfast sandwich to go and had no idea that the sandwich was going to be as big as I am! Seriously the portions are huge! I got breakfast and lunch out of that meal! Staff was super friendly and informative. I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service and good feels! All breakfasts are now $6 and lunches are $7. My three teenage children and I shared the Street Burger, the Cubano Sandwich and the Southwest Eggs Benedict. My son loved the potato salad that came with the burger and the sandwich. My daughter and I thought the Southwest Eggs Benedict with the Chipotle Hollandaise sauce and thick sliced bacon on the toasted muffin was the superior dish. We all agreed that the sandwiches were elevated with the toasted buns. The Cubano was on the salty side, but it paired well with the potato salad. The burger was a nice size. They had complimentary Lindor chocolates to end our meal. Because it is a donations based eatery, you paid no tax. Our meal came to $20, and we donated our tips to fight hunger in Phoenix. The staff is friendly and always happy to tell customers about the great mission they have."}
{"text":"After visiting J Levine's Auction we thought we would try this place for lunch.  What a pleasant surprise.  The food was great and the prices were even better.  I had the beef burger and it was one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.  Moist and very tasty.  Hubby had the chorizo burrito and loved it. The staff was very accommodating and friendly and we appreciated the staff coming over to talk with us.  Small place but worth every penny. $6.00 breakfast & & $7.00 for lunch.  Definitely a place you should try.  

The restaurant is a non-profit organization and provides food to needy families on a regular basis.  It's wonderful to have a great meal and do something for the community also.  Great food."}
{"text":"We read about this restaurant on yelp and decided to give it a try. My husband got the Southwest Benedict and I got the breakfast burrito chorizo. Both came with skillet potatoes and was excellent. The spices were excellent on both dishes.  Their coffee is made fresh with every Cup. This restaurant was opened about a year ago to provide a commercial kitchen to a not for profit food service for the kids from various schools that might not have enough food over a weekend. They also provide once a month food to families. This is a very worthwhile endeavor and gives the public a place to get breakfast and lunch at an excellent price while promoting their not-for-profit organization."}
{"text":"If you are in Scottsdale looking for a good breakfast, this is the perfect place and you'll be a part to great action too. They are a non-profit organisation and for every meal you buy they provide food to a family in need.
Very simple various breakfast option are $6.00 - lunch $7.00, since they are non profit you don't pay taxes !!
This has been our best breakfast while visiting AZ, it's freshly made according to your request, they will accommodate you to the maximum possible. The staff is super friendly.
If we ever come back in the area, we'll be back. 
They deserve their 5 stars no doubt!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and concept!!! 
I've been here several times and each time have had sweetheart service with a smile and a delicious meal for super cheap! 
I've ordered most of thier soups by now, and the veggie omlet.  All of thier soups are just $3 and if you get the chance, definintely order the Italian Wedding Soup.  The portion is very large, and the meatballs fill you up plenty.  The broth of this soup is so delish, it has egg in it also so its a bit on the thick side. It is a rockstar and makes me so happy that I had it both times when I visited last week! 

The omlete is perfect, exactly what I expected. Fresh veggies and just perfectly made.  

They do not serve quick coffee. Every glass is a pourover because they said whenever a pot is made, it doesn't go quickly enough and it ends up wasting money.
I wish they had better hours so I could visit more often. 

If you didn't read about it already, this is a non-profit organization where everything you buy goes directly to feed people in the area who cannot afford it.  I love eating good food and feeling good about where the money is going.  Doesn't get much better than that :)"}
{"text":"Good food, huge portion, and great service!

Found this cafe on yelp, the staff/waitresses there are very nice and helpful. Knowing that this is my first time here, she briefly introduce me what their restaurant do, and where the profit goes.

I ordered the south western egg Benedict, only costs $6 and the portion was huge for me.
It taste pretty good

Coffee only costs $1

Excellent service. The place is pretty clean, staff are extremely efficient in cleaning, and always greet you with a smile.
It's a pretty nice cafe where you can enjoy your food without feeling rush.
(I was there on a thurs morning/lunch time - around 10, it wasn't crowded then, I am not sure about other hours)"}
{"text":"This is like I cooked it at home. It's honestly the best breakfast place I've eaten at in any part of the valley, including way north Thomson peak and fountain hills. It probably has something to do with the fact that it's a non-profit that receives food donations. It probably helps that it uses a majority of the funds to feed kids who don't have access to it. This place is honestly great."}
{"text":"Fast service, very friendly lady working there, happy customers, good cause, and fantastic prices!"}
{"text":"Street Cafe does more than feeding and pleading your appetite, it feeds your soul. 
Their non-profit works feeds children in Arizona, I was so inspired about their good cause that I donated and raised some additional funds. 
The food and service were excellent, I actually did feel a little guilty I couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"Quite and relaxing. Hugh portions for $5 and great value and service. We will return."}
{"text":"Huge portions, excellent prices, friendly service, yummy food, and best of all this restaurant is a non-profit that assists children who are food insecure. I'm so glad I found this gem. Their breakfast potatoes are bomb. They serve a street coffee that's both coffee and espresso...umm yess!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place .  There food is amazing and the portions are out of 
Control .  The menu changes based on what is fresh and available .  $6 for 
Breakfast , $7 for lunch !! The best part is ,  THEY ARE A NON- PROFIT THAT FEEDS HUNGRY CHILDREN .. 100% 
Of your donation  is used to feed hungry 
Children . This non profit is FOR REAL 
& all the people that work here are 
Amazing & Committed !"}
{"text":"Always delicious food, great people and a great cause! We've been here multiple times and have yet to be disappointed. I personally like the alpha and omega breakfast burger (it can be another meal later) and the burritos. I don't think there's anything you can go wrong with on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Now that we got that out of the way, you must go here. The mission of these people are to feed children who have otherwise been forgotten. I spent $20 on breakfast and they have the means that can feed 5 children for a day for that amount. Help them in there calling to feed the children of Arizona who are in desperate need of a meal. A simple meal that to us is just a time of day but to child in need is a lifeline and presents a person that they otherwise feel looks them over and shows them they are valued and they have worth. Truly blessed to be reminded there is more to the Christmas season and life in general as we often become overwhelmed with our own problems. With love"}
{"text":"First, the altruistic aspect of the restaurant makes it a great place to go. When you add the terrific food and courteous service at a great price it makes this place one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Stopped in for my daily dose last week, Street cafe had friendly staff and knowledgable coffologist. Thanks for the fresh grounded coffee and also thanks for answering all my questions. Looks like this place was rather new but already had a good vibe going on, I'll be back next time I'm out in the East valley."}
{"text":"Ate it too fast to get a picture.  Had the spinach sun dried tomato ravioli.  Pretty awesome.  $7 with a soda.  What a deal!"}
{"text":"Good food, big portions, great price! I come here at least twice a week with my fiancé. They have great coffee too! And the front staff always remember us and our orders. I really love what they stand for and what they do here. If you haven't come In before, I highly recommend!"}

{"text":"My first lunch at the cafe and the Sonoran pasta was exquisite.  My server Meagan was friendly and helpful. This place is great!"}
{"text":"This place has outstanding food! One of my many favorites is there Veggie Burger Hawaiian style (and I'm not a vegetarian kinda guy). I've never had a bad lunch here!

The staff is very friendly and make sure you your drink is always full! 

It's part of a non-profit so don't forget to leave a couple extra bucks for the food backpack program for feeding children!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I can't believe the amount of food they dish out here for about 50% less than most diners charge. The staff rocks. Not to mention they help feed hungry kids. As long as I'm in Scottsdale I will keep coming here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great people serving delicious food. Please come have breakfast or lunch here when you are in Scottsdale to support this nonprofit. You will have a great meal with dedicated workers supporting feeding the needy children of Scottsdale and the local area."}

{"text":"ordered:
- ive had a lot of things on the menu, my favorites are the biscuits and gravy and the southwest benedict for breakfast and the many variations of shrimp tacos for lunch

pros:
- $6 for breakfast and $7 for lunch [no tax] in Scottsdale, that's ridiculous
- huge portions
- super friendly staff, i call my order in often and they are always patient on the phone when I ask them what's on the menu :D
- the menu changes often so I never get bored of anything
- amazing food and the proceeds go to a good cause

cons:
- hard to decide what to eat
- hours are 8am-2pm weekdays only"}
{"text":"This place has a five star rating for a variety of reasons. I haven't read them all, but I went there to eat after having read a few. Starting with the order experience at the counter to having to box half my breakfast at the end, everything was unbelievably amazing. Greeted with a smile, served the most fluffy and delicious veggie omelet I have ever consumed with home fried potatoes that crunched with delight, and having so much that I had to take a container home with me. Needless to say this is breakfast heaven and I'm sure to return to have my lunch fantasies fulfilled also. Thanks to some higher order that these type of places still exist."}
{"text":"Wow, what a concept! I am a vacationer from WI and I found this little \"hole in the wall\" non-profit cafe by means of Yelp. I tried it based on the reviews here, as well as its concept of giving back to the community in the form of feeding food insecure school children in Arizona and Texas. Since I am an Early Childhood special education teacher back home, this is a great concept for me to get on board with (as much as possible for me, given that I don't live in the community).

I ordered a \"Street Bagel.\" It consisted of a nicely toasted, but soft, bagel, with ham, cheese and egg, cooked to order (for me, that would be very hard scrambled). I also ordered one of the zero calorie \"Ice\" drinks that are fruit-flavored. But I digress. Back to the food...the food came out to me, nice and hot, served with fried potatoes. I didn't even know I was going to get fried potatoes! Score! It was very filling and more than enough food for me. I was impressed enough that I brought back a to-go order for my hubby, who was at our hotel. He thought everything was good too. His only issue was that he said the fried potatoes were a little spicy for him. I thought they were great, but he isn't much into spicy foods (to me, it tasted like \"Tony Chachere's\" seasoning or \"Slap Ya Mama\" seasoning, for those of you who know what I am talking about). Oh, and the whole shebang ran us 12 bucks, for both meals, plus the aforementioned \"all-natural\" fruit-flavored sodas (5 bucks for each meal, plus 1 buck for each soda).

If you don't see something on the menu that you would like, you can simply ask and they can probably make it, within reason. While I was waiting for my to-go order, I heard several people order something different and they were able to accommodate. It even states that they \"love a challenge,\" so just ask if you want different food.

Finally, everyone was very friendly there as well. And if you are into this, they play Christian music on their speakers, but it is not overbearing or too loud, nor do they push a Christian agenda. They simply serve really decent food at an excellent price for a good cause. If we are ever back in the area, I will be sure to stop by there again for some more good-tasting food."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. Met Lisa, who poured a nice hot cup of coffee and helped me order. I couldn't decide. Lol went with the Street Benedict with bacon and ranch hollandaise sauce. I absolutely  loved that the English muffin was toasted and crunchy.  The best part is they do all this to provide food for the hungry and hurting!!!"}
{"text":"We had a private birthday party tonight for about 40 people. The appetizers, entree's and dessert were absolutely delicious. Several options were offered from which we chose our entree. The staff was great and the dedicated cause of feeding hungry school children is sincerely one of the best undertakings I have witnessed."}
{"text":"Took a chance and stopped for lunch. Very small place but very cute. He orders the counter and bring the food to you. Ordered a Cobb salad and it was great. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Upon walking into the Street Cafe, the staff was extremely helpful with the menu and questions I had.
I ended up getting the southwest eggs benedict which had explosive flavor featuring their chipotle style sauce and pico combo on top of two eggs with four slices of bacon on an English muffin. Let's please not forget the hand made breakfast potatoes. Oh my were they delightful!
I won't speak for my boyfriend and what his experience was but from the body language and empty plate, I will assume he was equally as pleased.

If you know what's good for you, you'll venture into this quaint cafe!

Cheers!"}

Just plain cool!"}

Did I mention it is a non-profit, what restaurant do you know that is non-profit?"}

Where else can you go to enjoy tasty eats, for a great price, and helping the community as well.  Also I just booked them to cater an event for me and it's going to be great."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! My husband and I just ate here and both enjoyed our meals. I had the southwest eggs benedict and my husband had the Alpha Omega burger. They both came with flavorful potatoes on the side. My eggs benedict was delicious with a little zip, and the bacon on it was nice and crispy. My husband finished his whole burger (he had to eat it with a fork and knife because it was big!) and enjoyed the added touch of a lightly toasted buttery bun. I also had their coffee (they roast their own beans!) and my husband enjoyed his mocha. Everything was so affordable as well! It was also great to know that this supports a program that feeds hungry children in Arizona. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Eat good and do good!  This place has such a great vibe. We love it for breakfast.  Southwest Benedict is our favorite.  Every meal you purchase helps feed someone who is hungry. Go get breakfast or lunch here. Simple straightforward and delicious."}
{"text":"Had a hunt to locate this using maps apps, but asked a local lady across the lot. This is actually E of Saba's Western Store, less than 100ft, in strip of stores in rear parking area. Small and local feel cafe. Have asked for 6 shot Americano and honey with a Charizo Burrito. I sure like this. Americano is perfect. Wow here. Real fried potatoes, great salsa and best burrito I've had anywhere. Great service here. Definitely a Best Of experience. Absolutely will return."}
{"text":"I come here almost daily for coffee, staff is super nice always!! I occasionally get lunch or breakfast which is always great as well! Thanks for being awesome guys!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you come upon places that are more than what they appear to be, and Street Cafe and Coffee Lounge is just that.

Tucked away on the SE corner of Scottsdale and Shea is this small cafe with an incredible purpose: service.  Not only are they giving great service to those who come to enjoy their breakfast or lunch, but for every meal that is purchased, a portion of the proceeds are given back to many of the shelters around the Valley.  They are paying forward their gratitude to those in need, and that on it's own is already a reason to check this place out.

But what's even cooler, is that the food and coffee are absolutely legit!  They serve breakfast all day, and their pricing scheme is simple: $5 for any breakfast item, $6 for any lunch item.  That's it.  It is so affordable, that you don't expect it to be delicious.....but it is!  I had the Alpha Omega breakfast burger (pork sausage patty with a friend egg on top), and it was fabulous!!  In fact, it was so big that I could only eat 3/4ths of it.  Plus, it came with potatoes on the side, which were also super tasty.  I got A LOT of food, and it was an incredible value.

I will definitely be coming back to the Street Cafe, and I plan on sending as many people I can there in order to keep paying it forward to those in need.  It's a win-win, and I am all in :)"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place isn't packed everyday the food is fantastic, the girl behind the counter is extremely nice and the prices are right...of you haven't tried this place you should.."}
{"text":"Ordered Southern Benedict and LOVE it!!!! It's delicious and the chorizo is nicely cooked with just the right flavor!! Dirty Chai coffee is marvelous too!!! Will definitely come again! Thanks to friendly Jason too!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! Delicious, affordable and philanthropic! I wish the Street Cafe all the success in the world!  I had the Asian noodle bowl and the iced vanilla latte, both were great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious with huge portions and super reasonable pricing!! Plus benefits hungry kids!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The Food and drinks are delicious and and inexpensive and the cause is to feed hungry kids in the valley. Its a win-win situation. I'm definitely going to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Special menu item was biscuits and gravy. Might have been the best i ever had. Friendly service. Awesome awesome. Will definitely be back again. Probably today. I'm heading there now probably"}
{"text":"Had the street burger. So yummy. 
Parents eat here a lot and love the staff
They donate food to help feed children"}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of my best finds thru Yelp. Awesome little cafe that does breakfast and lunch... and they do it right! Small rotating menu of some great food, super reasonable prices and did I mention.. this is a non-profit organization! Proceeds go to help feed children in need through out Arizona. 

Do yourself a favor and give them a try.

Thanks again guys, I'll be back again! Maybe even 2 times in one day again."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos the day I stopped by.  Even better that it is a non-profit helping the less fortunate. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Such a great place that is truly giving back to the community. I came here on a hot day when I was sorta-hungry but moreso trying to escape the heat and find some reasonably priced lunch, which can be tough in this part of town. I looked on Yelp and found the usual high end, aesthetically pleasing Scottsdale places that I was not in the mood for so I kept scrolling and found this 5 star gem a few pages down. I was confused why they were so far down, yet had such a high rating and were less than a mile from me, but I digress (you have to say digress in your reviews if you aspire to be a respected Yelper, FYI). Once I made it inside, the owner Lisa greeted me. She is a very nice lady and makes you feel welcome. She went on to explain that her and her husband opened this place as a non profit to give back to the community. They fill back packs with food and give them to needy children and help out people in need in the community. What an amazing place! But then I started to wonder, is that why they have all these 5 star reviews? I love a local business that gives back, but I was starting to get very hungry. Lisa then talked me into the carnitas tacos. I am always skeptical over pork from any restaurant but she could sense I was willing (I'm not picky) and coerced me into ordering them. They were really some of the best carnitas tacos I've ever had. The pork was top notch, the flour tortilla was a little \"gringo\" but it was all so good together. I will be back whether it be to eat or to donate! Keep up the amazing work Lisa!"}
{"text":"I ordered this week's special of ravioli with chicken and mozzarella for my employees and they LOVED it. From comments about how it tastes homemade to \"can we get more food from there?\" I wouldn't second guess ordering again from the Street Café. Great customer service, great food, and helping turn hunger into hope with Kitchen on the Street... What more could you ask for? A must try!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and the food was very homey. I loved it! The biscuits and gravy taste just right and the prices cannot be beat! We ordered for for two and the bill was just over $16. And just found out that 100% of the proceeds go towards feeding hungry kids! Wow! I'm blown away! You can tell the staff here are very happy to be here. Made me feel great knowing they were a non-profit establishment. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This little place is awesome. We stopped in today and loved the cause! I loved the biscuits and gravy and my husband wasn't a huge fan of the chorizo burrito but we would both come back! A lot of food for a cheap price and supporting a great cause."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly welcome! The Pair of Dogs may be the best hot dog of my life!! Flavor packed links and perfectly rendered bacon in fresh bun. Mmmm~Mmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened 3 years ago- amazing food for a phenomenal price AND they are a non profit that helps feed the less fortunate.  Any time I'm hungry in the Scottsdale and Shea are this is my first thought"}
{"text":"I tried this place out for lunch last weekend. The food was fantastic and very inexpensive. $6.00 for lunch! My teenage daughter is a very picky eater and she said her bacon cheeseburger was the best she'd ever had. Staff are very friendly. Good atmosphere and vibe. All profits are being used to feed hungry kids - so that's very cool. Check it out if your in the area. You won't believe what $6.00 will buy you!"}
{"text":"Such a great cause and friendly staff!   The food is fresh and huge portions!   My fiancé and I will definitely be back when we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time here. It's a great concept with great cause, and a great husband and wife team! We wanted to order everything on the menu, but decided on the Alpha Omega and the Crunchy Chicken BLT. Both DELICIOUS! The menu is always changing, and can't wait for our next visit there!"}
{"text":"Wonderful non-profit that helps supply food for kids.  For each meal purchased a meal is provided for a child.  A win-win in my book.  Not to mention the food is phenomenal!  I had the  special of the day, carnitas tacos, and oh my, they were yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food Great price Great cause!!! The food was amazing and the proceeds go to feed hungry school children. I had the mamas meatloaf sandwich. It was melt-in-your-mouth good. I definitely recommend this wonderful little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Prices are good for the area. The food was just so so. Far too much salt on the tots they had with the special. 
Had the panini. It was a little on the greasy side for me. I think I'll go back and try the breakfast. 
Friendly staff. Quick service. Cool little place."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I are in Scottsdale for a work conference, and I saw this place on Yelp and couldn't resist with all the positive reviews. I also liked the idea of supporting a place that owns a non profit. We were immediately greeted when we walked in the door, and the menu was explained to us since this was our first time. The guy that took my order was very friendly, and checked on us a couple of times to make sure that everything came out fine and tasted great. I got the Southwest Eggs Benedict (may not be remembering the name correctly) and it was amazing! Eggs were cooked to perfection, and the English muffin underneath was the perfect level of toasted so I could cut through it easily with my knife. My co-worker got the breakfast burrito and also said it was very good. Would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Found this place on Yelp and decided to go grab a coffee... Later found out they donate food and time to charitable organizations in the valley!

Good people, great service, quality flavored that are brought out but their foods!! This place is a \"win win!\""}
{"text":"Coffee is top-notch and roasted in house. I had a chorizo omelette for a late breakfast, and it was probably the best omelette I've ever had. Staff is very friendly and professional. Laid back atmosphere, very clean. You absolutely cannot beat the price. What I got for $6.25 would probably cost you $10-15 elsewhere. Very deserving of a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Just had brunch at this restaurant and was shocked to see some of the best Christians I have ever met. Most of this restaurant's proceeds go toward helping out those in poverty who don't have enough to eat, with a focus on families with children. Not only are their values something I respect and believe in, but their food is fantastic! Can't go wrong with anything on their menu - the Tortalini and Turkey Wrap were scrumptious. 

The owners are also kind and they care about their customers - so much so, that they either charge $5 or $6 flat for their meals. 

Tl;dr: compassionate owners with great values and awesome, affordable food. Eat here - you won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"Not only is it all for a good cause, but the food is outstandingly fresh and the service is really friendly. The prices are so good you can tip your server and tip the donation jar and still come away with a reasonable total."}
{"text":"Great people!!! Jason makes your experience there a blast. Vinnie and Lisa are fantastic people. Food is delicious and you get large portions. It's only $5 for breakfast and $6 lunch. Wow!! Must go and support their cause. A Non-profit that feeds 100's of children on the weekend. That's why they are not open on the weekend. Lol..."}
{"text":"Shrimp Tacos were really good. Crunchy, not greasy. The pasta salad side dish was tasty too! Pasta was al dente, not mushy...greatly appreciated! Prices are very reasonable. Get there before 2pm, because they close at 2. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"I had been told my a coworker that this was a great place to eat with a great mission. I finally had some free time so I swung by to grab lunch to bring back to the office. I'm glad I did!

The interior is on the smaller side but it's a cute little spot. There were several tables taken when I walked in but there was still space for others to sit down and eat. 

Two really nice guys greeted me and took my order. They have breakfast items for 7 dollars and lunch items for 8 dollars. I went with the pollo burrito and oh wow.... it's hands down the biggest burrito I have ever seen!! It even came with a side of beans. The picture doesn't do it justice since it got a little tussled around on my drive back to the office, but the flavor was amazing. Green chilies, onions, cheese, a delicious tortilla and the chicken wasn't too dry at all it was perfect! I seriously could have fed 2-3 people from my meal. I couldn't finish it and trust me, that rarely happens with me. Unbelievable value for the price you pay.

Of course, the best part about this place is their mission and the fact they are a non-profit dedicated to feeding those in need. What better reason to stop in and get the most bang for your buck??"}
{"text":"Nearly in the shadow of the \"big\" breakfast places of Scottsdale, tucked away in a commercial plaza steps from Shea Blvd., this humble mom & pop nonprofit cafe provides outstanding coffee & excellent food to customers at low prices, while devoting their profits to feeding children.  The Alpha Omega breakfast sandwich was all it should be & more - a very generous size for $5 (same price for every breakfast entree ): sausage patty, dried egg & cheese on a good roll), including hash browns.  Friendliest proprietors around, who welcome their customers & briefly explain their mission.  The result is a desire to pay a little more to help the cause, which I happily did."}
{"text":"Found this place looking for a coffee shop and lunch spot in the area. Great food and coffee at great prices for a great cause. Had the tilapia fish tacos and iced coffee which were delicious. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"You cannot find a better concept and restaurant in town that benefits an amazing cause for Arizona! Food is great, menu changes daily, customer service is superb, and their mission is unbeatable. Since they are a Non-Profit they don't charge sales tax but be sure to leave an extra tip or even make a  donation for their charitable mission - The Bags of Hope (food backpack) program which serves school-age children weekend meals and snacks for over 1,500 kids during the school year! Breakfast $5 and Lunch $6 - you can't beat that! An added bonus, you'll walk out feeling great after this meal, no matter what!!"}
{"text":"Good chorizo burrito. Ordered It you go. It came with side of skillet potatoes and continer of salsa.  Menu price $6 and that's all you'll pay because the restraunt is also a charity organization that donates proceeds to help children in need of food and such.  Great place and great service, very friendly. What a great way to feed yourself and a child in need of help. So an extra star for being more than a restaurant, but for also being community minded and socially responsible :-)"}
{"text":"We had traditional eggs Benedict and the crunchy french toast, plus two medium lattes for $20! The service was great and quick, and the food was excellent. To boot, these good folks help feed school kids in the area. WIN WIN!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a long study session or meeting up with friends. The barista was so nice and welcoming! My study buddy and I were there for several hours, and we were even offered free coffee after we'd already finished our ordered drinks. I like that the pricing is easy to follow ($5 for breakfast, $6 for lunch), and that all of the proceeds support local charity work. I will have to try something to eat next time as the food that went by looked great!"}
{"text":"This was a great local find with a wonderful mission.  The food was good and the portions were huge.  The prices are very reasonable!  Check them out!"}
{"text":"Wow - exceptional cause they support giving 100% of profits to children meals but way more then that the service, food and overall experience topped most other restaurants!!  Way to go- this will be high on our list to return when visiting"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful last minute find after we stayed at Talking Stick Resort the evening before. The best part about this place is that 100% of the proceeds go back to the community-with help feeding kids and families. The food was wonderful. I ordered a ham and cheese omelet and fried potatoes. The omelet was huge! The one nice thing that I was happy about was the fact that all breakfast dishes are only $6 and the latte we ordered was only $2.50 and it was better than the overpriced coffee shops. My soda was only a $1 per can. My honey ordered the Eggs Benedict with fried potatoes and that was equally amazing. 
The staff was very courteous and came around several times to make sure we were doing ok and didn't need anything. Also they serve lunch and all meals for lunch are only $7. 
Another great observation was there were cops coming in often to order food so you know that the food is great and affordable if they are stopping by for meals. 
We live maybe 20 minutes from here but it is such a great way to give back to the community while having an affordable meal without breaking the bank. 
They also have a website for people to donate money on an ongoing basis or a one-time donation. There is an area to sign up online to volunteer there at the restaurant. 
As far as the environment-it was very clean and organized and it is appropriate for family and friends-all age groups.There was plenty of parking right by the door."}
