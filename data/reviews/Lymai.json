{"text":"This is possibly the worst restaurant I've been to, while the server was nice, the food is the worst. I had the ginger chicken and it was watery and flavorless and the chicken was old, very old., the general tao chicken was old and soggy. The rest of the food was an experience that should never be experienced again. So 0 stars for food, 1 star for service."}
{"text":"excellent service, very friendly and helpful. food was very good and prices were decent.  all in all great night at lymai, thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Lymai is a vietnamese restaurant on the very busy St-Denis, between Ontario and Ste-Catherine. The decor is nice, with small wodden tables and lots of space. There are too sections, and the one closest to the entrance is especially well lit because of the large window facing the street.  The food is moderately priced for the type of food, with most dishes being around $10. Appetizers are somewhat expensive, but for lunch you can get a soup and a spring roll for an extra $2. That's pretty much what their lunch specials are, by the way.  I ordered the spring rolls, soup, and general tao (general tso in Canada). The soup was hot, even after waiting a couple minutes. I burned by tongued... the spring roll was excellent, crisp and fresh, but the sauce was very blend.   I know... why try general tao when you're at a vietnamese restaurant? I shouldn't have and was a little disappointed. They seemed to make a big deal about it on the menu, so I gave it a try. The sauce wasn't spicy at all, or sweet for that matter. It was more akin to the typical brown sauce (although thicker) that chinese restaurants serve. It was served with sesame seeds, which seemed odd.   The serve was good, and the French waiter was polite and checked up on me several times. The bill came rapidly, and I appreciated the waiter up front asking me if I was a student (10% student discount) and giving it to me even though I had forgotten my ID at home.  Overall, it was ok. The place looks good, but nothing over the top. The food was ok, but nothing fantastic or better than most of the vietnamese I've tried recently. The service was excellent. I'd definitely go again, but only if I were in the area and were especially looking for vietnamese."}
