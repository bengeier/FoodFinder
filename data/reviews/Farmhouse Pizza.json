{"text":"Worst service I ever encountered.  My car broke down and we were hungry  so we called this place.  I don't eat gluten so I ordered a salad.  My boyfriend got pizza, a Philly steak,  and garlic bread.  The sent the wrong salad and don't answer when I called.  My bf complained that the Philly was dry,  the pizza not cooked through and the garlic bread doughy.  I called today when they opened (supposedly  noon but I didn't get a hold of anyone till 12:30) so they can send me the correct salad or give me my 8$ back.  The girl says I can bring them the wrong salad well I don't have a Fckn car and if I did why would I have to waste my gas for your mess up?  Then they say they will send the correct salad.  This was at noon.  It's 7pm Now and still no salad. I will never use this place a gain and make sure anyone I know stays away from this place."}
{"text":"Worse service I've had in my life. I've ordered delivery from this place on many occasions because I really like their wings unfortunately, they would forget my ranch on the last few times. One time they delivered so late that I couldn't call and get more ranch. The second and last time I requested ranch from the driver and he said he would come back (which took over a hour). I called the store and requested new wings and to pick up the cold ones when they brought the ranch of course the delivery drive brought the ranch and no new wings. It's clear that they have caller ID because they already knew it was me when I called again and they spoke in Spanish and we're talking about me thinking I couldn't understand. Once I responded in Spanish the woman put the phone down and then a man got on the phone who claimed to be the manager and he was even more rude. They completely lost my business for good and I was ordering from them a few times a month. Pure idiots is the best way I can describe the people who run this establishment."}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace!!! The managers don't know what customer service is! Never will I order their undercooked pizza, cold fries, no extra ranch and on top of it......garlic bread and a 2 liter Coke took them till the next NIGHT after 8pm to deliver since they forgot it the night before. Yes I called that night, they were to deliver. Nope. Called the next day, 9 damn hours to deliver garlic bread and a liter of Coke? I'd rather order Dominos......"}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would the manager lady is a complete moron she acts like she can't hear you on the phone they delivered $25 worth of food did not bring our pop then they said they had to go back and get our pop didn't even offer us free breadsticks or anything for their mistake bad bad business never will order from them again I asked to speak to the manager they don't want to do anything to make up for it what type of customer service is this place"}
{"text":"This pizza place is getting two stars from me. I would only give it one, but I actually really liked the pizza. Sadly, I am very disappointed with the service. Let me explain. I set my order up as a delivery, ordering the special #1. Mind you, this was what was advertised on their website. It said it came with breadsticks. When our delivery driver got here, he couldn't figure out where to go in the complex, although I gave very specific instructions with my delivery notes. This was not a big deal though. I noticed the breadsticks did not make it, so I asked him. He said he would check at the restaurant and call me back. 30 Minutes later, I called because I had not heard from him. I explained the situation and the man I spoke with told me that they are the new owners and that the specials had changed. I said well I have never ordered from you before, and I just got your specials from your website. He said they should be changed on the website, but that he would check and call me back. No return call (and yes, they had my number). I hope the new owners realize what a bad business practice this is...this was an incredibly easy fix, and if they had just brought us our breadsticks we would become repeat customers. Sorry, but they have now lost my business."}
{"text":"I just put one star because I couldn't put a negative 10. I find it hard to believe that someone could screw a pizza up untill I ordered from farmhouse. Worst pizza I had in my life period and for the wings huh. Horrible so bad that my kids wouldn't eat them and they love hot wings that's sad. So to farmhouse after reading a couple other reviews I think you guys should quit and go out of business and do Phoenix a favor. And if your reading this deciding if you want to eat here DON'T RUN AWAY FAST BARROS IS DOWN THE STREET"}
{"text":"They had a great deal on a large pizza, wings, & a 2 liter, so I got that & a salad. The salad was crisp, & had plenty of cheese & croutons! I asked for dressing on the side & got it, and 2 containers, too! Tasty Cesar!  The sausage & mushroom..... I haven't had italian sausage this yummy in a long time, it reminds me of the pizza I used to get as a kid! The mushrooms are above average as well! I groaned at the first bite!  The hot wings were yummy, nothing exceptional, though they saw I wanted blue cheese dressing & I got it.  The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because I think the driver got lost, he apologized for the wait, & my pizza was kinda cold when I got it; however, the wings were still very hot."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and great Calzones and the best philly in AZ  this is my pizza place from now on"}
{"text":"Disgusting Caesar salad barely any lettuce just a bunch of small crutons and nasty cheap  parmesan cheese powder the Italian sub sandwich was delicious just didn't have mayo mustard or Pickles"}
{"text":"I did not have the yelp app before this, but this pizza was so bad I felt obligated to download it. The pizza took an hour and 45 mins to get here not only was it cold but wrong. The wings were cold the fry.s were soggy. Plain and simple THIS PIZZA SUCKED I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"Delicious! We ordered for delivery-- two subs and some mozzarella sticks and fries. They certainly didn't skimp on anything. Some places serve you bread with a bit of meat in between and call is a sub.. Not these guys! The sandwiches were filling. Two people can get a sub each and a side of fries, and you are good to go. Definitely want to stop by the actual place so that we try the food fresh out of the kitchen and hot :)   Little sidenote for the business: we discovered you guys when we got your flyer on our apartment gate."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a NEGATIVE 5 star review, I would! It's been about 3 months since our last experience so we decided to give this place another chance since we had once enjoyed it so much PLUS our options are limited in our area. We ordered off their on-line menu assuming everything was accurate and if it wasn't they would contact us to explain as all good customer service driven companies do. When the order arrived it was wrong...AGAIN!!! My husband calls them and politely explains we just want it corrected. Not asking for money back or any unreasonable request beyond good customer service and to do what is right. The gal that answered (Rosie Wilson) argues with my husband the entire time telling him he is wrong and there is nothing they can or are willing to do to make it right. REALLY!? What the hell kind of business are your running!? I work as an Operations Manager and implement our customer service policies and procedures. I can tell you first hand the way this situation was handled was completely inappropriate! If someone in my company treated customers with half the disrespect we received, not only would I make it right with the customer but that employee would be fired on the spot! We didn't want anything for free (would have gladly returned the wrong pizza), we didn't ask for anything unreasonable (just want what we ordered and paid $40 for), and instead what we got was incredibly RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL treatment. I am all about second and sometimes even third chances but there is no way in hell I will EVER spend a dime at this place again and you damn sure better believe I will spread the news!!! Hey Farmhouse, if you knew ANYTHING at all about customer service you would know that if you are lucky a happy customer will share their experience with one or two people, but an UNHAPPY customer will share their experience with 10+ (usually anyone that will listen). In other words, not only did you lose our business but you have successfully lost at minimum 10 other customers on top of that. Kudos to you for digging your hole deeper...it will only be a matter of time until your doors close if you keep operating this way!"}
{"text":"They supposedly open at 12:00pm on Sundays. I called to place a carry out order at that time and no one answered the phone. I guess you don't want my money. The pizza is good and all of the other items that I've ordered are good, but if the service is bad I will NOT purchase your food. I don't care how good it is!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for lunch yesterday as I was in this part of town on business. Had to order a few things since the minimum was $15 and the prices are very reasonable. Being a sandwich lover I had to try the Italian. I've had great sandwiches all over the place but I have to say this one of the best. I luv the thick sliced meats & the tasty bread all served nice and toasty. The cheesecake was a little frozen when I got it but it was a wonderful treat. Next time I'm in the area I will for sure have to try the meatball."}
{"text":"This place is a must try , very good food the staff is exceptional , very old school , and a must try"}
{"text":"The food was disgusting !  The fries were tasteless. I don't think I ever felt more disgusted with food in my life. My cheesecake was expired! It didn't even taste like cheesecake. I swear I was fine with the calzone and fries I was like it's nasty but fuck it. But the cheesecake is expired hell no dude that's so gross! Never again!"}
{"text":"I was parusing delivery places near me and had the misfortune of finding the farmhouse. We ordered their their 19.99 wings bread soda pizza deal and waited for it to arrive.  THe lady that showed up BARELY spoke english and screwed herself out of a tip because she literally had no change. Her loss. Took the stuff inside the house. No garlic bread and the pizza was smashed into the side of the cardboard. Naturally my 7 year old wouldn't touch it. Called them up and they said they would redeliver it. My poor kid waited as long as she could but she fell asleep, they never showed. Called them this morning and the same whiner that was manning the phones the night before (if you can call it that) answered and gave him the rundown, AGAIN. At which point pow wows were had and calls were made and after sitting for 8 minutes of cluckin and beepin the whiney one came back and said NOW THEY WOULD DELIVER IT. 12 hours later is a little above and beyond so I asked for a refund. They told me I had to go through the website. I paid cash!!!! Then I was told that I would have to come get the money. ARE YOU KIDDING?!?!?! You drove out here and took my money you can bring it back. I was recently in an accident so I don't have a car to come and get it so now I am waiting for them to redeliver a pizza that I don't even want. I WILL NEVER EVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN. Money is tight and so when I spend $25 I want what I paid for and if a company isn't grateful for the business especially when the economy is bad, I will just stick with a $5 pizza from Little Ceasars. Someone should have told them that our money is what keeps their doors open."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here food was delivered in a timely manner the delivery guy was very nice and professional the food was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! And for what we paid the calzone was HUGE the pizza was fabulous papajohns is out and YOUR IN!!!!!"}
{"text":"Placed an order on GrubHub this afternoon at 2:45 and it said the food should arrive about 3:18. At 4 p.m. we called and the guy that answered said he'd call the delivery driver to find out what's going on and would call me back. He called back a couple minutes later and said our food was delivered 20 minutes ago. He verified our address and it was correct. Not sure who got our food but it definitely wasn't us. Waited an hour and a half for nothing. Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Never again. 5.99 for a 6 inch Italian sub. FYI not an Italian sub. It's a bologna sub lol. Well it has alot of cotto salami. The bread was actually good. I don't know where it is ordered from but I liked it. Just by having this sandwichI have a feeling the rest of stuff is not so good. Sorry Farmhouse I am not a fan. Sometimes people find a gem in these little hole in the wall joints. Not here. For those who did give a decent review good for you and I am glad someone enjoys Farmhouse. I believe in supporting the local small businesses. FYI I did not smell food when I walked in. That was wierd."}
{"text":"Oh My Gosh!!! This place was soooooooo disgusting!!  First of all to pay 11+ for a 6\" sub and French fries, was highway robbery.  Just sayin  I have a hard time believing some of the reviews for this place.  I don't see how you could like their so called Italian even remotely good.  You must have never had a sub sandwich in your life.  On the board the sandwich ingredients included, your regular meats, ham, cappicola, salami, etc etc.   The sub I got included the following.... black forest ham (maybe?? - it honestly tasted like store bought store brand ham) and COTTO SALAMI!!! It was so thick that is all you tasted.  I will never go back and eat here.  As my friend and I were waiting for our food, we thought what a great time to try a slice of pizza as their special was .99 for a slice.  We asked the girl at the counter,( who, by the way also had her two children at the counter as well....weird, yes.) for a slice and she said.... oh, we don't have any...  HUH?    It was not a good experience.... DO NOT GO HERE...IT SUCKS!!!!.  There are other places for desperation food for a lot less in walking distance than to enter here.   this is one of those places that you could definitely earn the Maverick badge.... hahaha  Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"They've got good specials now and then, but it's really forgettable. Pizzas are way too salty, toppings are barely there, and the standard dough is practically thin crust, meaning you aren't getting much food while paying $13 for a large with 3 toppings. It's not that I would reject this if someone gave it to me, it's just that for the same price, I can indulge myself in way better products around the valley and feel way more satisfied after a couple slices. Maybe it has staying power because there are barely any independent pizza joints around here?"}
{"text":"The calzone was amazing but everything else was not very hot or warm and all the fries were cold and i only got a few fries not too many they are just big. The wings were pretty good but we also had to put them in the microwave to heat them up again. I also ordered the mix batch of fish and shrimp and only got shrimp and some fries inside. The first time i had ordered from this place everything was amazing and every plate came full to the top now its all mediocre and medium to low portions."}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever! The thick crust is thin and I dint even get all my order and they argues with me and told them I can send them a snap shot of what it says. The pizza is small as everything......honestly could have went with little Caesars tasted just like theirs and it would have been cheaper and gotten more. Didn't get my sprite and the guy that dropped off the food had a young boy with him around 9 years old to translate! Never ordering from this place again!"}
{"text":"Great subs! Wish I would have discovered this place a lot earlier, instead of a week before I move!"}
