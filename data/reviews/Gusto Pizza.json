{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Its located on a corner but in a way that its hidden from view.  The owners are very friendly and know how to cook pizza.  The cost of the pizza is also reasonable with many options for the toppings.   I have not tried it but they also sell samosa chat. I will try that next time."}
{"text":"Bang for buck pizza, you can't go wrong. Very cheap and you get a solid amount of food."}
{"text":"This is purely a place of nostalgia for those people who live around the Stephen Leacock area. Owned by multiple people throughout the years, Gusto Pizza has barely changed and still looks the same as it did over 5 years ago. Mostly high schoolers come here for the cheap food which is frankly the best part of this.  You can either can get fries or a pizza slice at a dirt cheap price. Both items are mediocre at best but does the job when you are craving something. What they are known for is their fries, ketchup, and hot chilli sauce combination. You take the fries and you shake it.  The owners are nice people but overall, I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to come here. If you do decide to come, never come during school lunch hours or 3:00."}
{"text":"food had gone worst since they change the owner of the stores, but a lot of choices to make...WANTED???do not get poutine...i would refine tht as a soup...it is very liquefy and do not taste good"}
