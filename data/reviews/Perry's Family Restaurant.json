{"text":"The salad bar was fresh and full. My dinner was excellent. I could not finish it!  Jane our server was excellent!  Very nice dinner out!!!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple times and only once was our food good. The service was horrible and the waitresses were rude and you could hear them complaining. The waitress messed up my boyfriends burger three times until she got it right."}
{"text":"I have been here and had breakfast a couple times with my boyfriend.  restaurant was busy, but we were seated right away both times.  portions were generous and the food was good.  on one visit I had pancakes, eggs and sausage.  I could not finish everything.  the other time I got a breakfast sandwich that was new to their menu sausagege and eggs on a roll.  it was really good.  the prices are reasonable, service was good and the food was good.  we are already talking about going back again, but maybe at lunch time  so we can try some other items."}
{"text":"just, got done eating at this diner. salad bar was decent. my Burger was good. friendly people, not too crowded for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Dropped in here when my wife was taking her driving tests at the exam center next door. We had breakfast and it was only \"OK\". We were there twice in the space of 2 weeks and each time the food came out less than hot, which I find unforgiveable when the place is busy! Don't leave it on the window so long might be a tip? My wife sent hers back as it was \"cold\"; but as I was hungry I tolerated mine. Typical dated d√©cor and the restroom is quite small also, with only room for 1 person. ample parking outside, good servers with friendly attitudes, and reasonable value for money. haven't tried anything but breakfast fare; but will not be going again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Been here one time and really liked it.  Salad bar has a great variety and so does the menu!!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere befitting of price ranges. Kid got sprinkle pancakes, he was in heaven. This is basically an entire birthday cake for breakfast"}
{"text":"I will never eat here again after I ordered a club sandwich... It needed some more mayo they put so little on and when I got more mayo and put it on, I took a bite they mayo had gone rancid it was disgusting... Now for me I would of taken off a star or two for that because my other meals there have been decent but... What brings me to this one star is what I heard the waitress tell the hostess moments after taking my plate away she said something to the tune of \"I told him that  fridge was on the fritz again now I've served bad mayo again\" again that was the word that caught me AGAIN you knew the mayo you served me had a chance to be off and yet instead of tasting it or smelling it you handed it to me nope no nope not at all ever AGAIN I am sorry but I will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in to Perry's family restaurant on a Sunday about 1. The restaurant at that time was approximately 50% full and we were seated right away. I ordered a coffee and my son got a water. My first order of business is always coffee in the coffee should always be full and there should always be somebody walking around with a pot offering the top somebody off. Not only was this cup about 5 ounces but also it took me forever to flight somebody down to get me another cup of coffee. not that I should have drank a second cup of coffee because it actually tasted really pretty burnt and not something I probably should have had a second cup of. our table had the street of creamer and sugar or actually I prefer the International Delight vanilla things. I did stop at two cups of coffee and decided to wait till home when I could actually make a decent cup of joe.

I ordered a ham and cheese omelette with some home fries which were the shredded kind in they were actually a little burned and I am a big fan of home fries but this just simply did not do it for me.  The Omelette was mediocre and it serve the purpose but I don't think I would go out of my way to find this place again.

The good part of the review is my son did have a pancake which seem to be a little bigger than his head and he really liked the bacon he said it was extra crunchy.  From a price point perspective it was priced a little higher than my normal stomping grounds and I think they probably could up the portion just a little bit to meet what the food was costing. Overall two-and-a-half to three stars"}
{"text":"Great value with superior service. Family friendly atmosphere.  My family and I stopped at this restaurant from out of town and we were very impressed. The prices and service were superb and the location was clean and well kept.  For $10 I got Jumbo Shrimp, fries, a cinnamon roll and the salad bar! The staff were humorous and friendly but not at all bothersome. If I didn't live so far away from this place it would be a regular eatery for my family."}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast, Just moved to Perry.  Perry does not offer a lot of 'chain' restaurants (which is great) thought we would give a local one a try.  

Restaurant is a little dated.
Prices are pretty good (7-12) for breakfast

Food was very good.

Ill be here again for sure"}
{"text":"A cute, little family diner out in the middle of nowhere. Not horrible, not great--just lots of senior citizens partaking in Friday night AYCE fish fries, etc. Their breakfast is also tolerable. 

They do have a soup and salad bar (gasp!), which I usually avoid, but nothing else was remotely healthy on the menu. Alas, I was sort of impressed by their freshly cut veggies, especially the cucumbers and carrots. You could tell none of it was from a bag. On the lettuce-front, they suffered, but at least the offered chopped romaine. And all the other toppings were pretty standard for a family restaurant. I also gave the chicken noodle soup a whirl and it was pretty salty, but still had a good flavor. It was also pipping hot! 

The boys got the ACYE perch fry and the kids size mac 'n cheese, which was a huge portion! I heard the fish was just 'OK' and was most likely frozen. Meh... the fries looked frozen too. 

I wouldn't say this place is horrible, especially since it's always pretty packed. But I will say that better the frozen foods, the carpet and the clientele, this place would make Gordon Ramsey flip his lid. \"Look at it! It's frozen!\""}
{"text":"I worked here 3 times. They first time for over a year and I left. I acme back and then I was let go for school reasons, then I was called back last August. I was happy to come back. I'm the server with the braces on her knees. I want to let you know I was just let go. Yes. 4 day before Christmas! I admit I was leaving and I turned in a 2 week notice. That was last Saturday 12/17. Tony let me go. What kind of owner let's a server go 4 days before Christmas? And I was scheduled to work Christmas eve. I was depending on my tips for extra gifts."}
{"text":"Had a really good family grilled steak, corn, and green beans. All of it was very tasty and well prepared. The salad bar has numerous selections, and was very clean. Our server Marlene was sweet, funny, and a hustler, great job!"}
{"text":"I will never go back!  The food was bad and overpriced,  for lunch I spent $28.00 on 2 kids meals and a sandwich plus beverages.  What really got me was my niece got soup and salad with her meal, she doesn't like salad so she didn't  get that just soup.  She took a couple bites of soup and didn't like that either so she gave it to my 4 year old the waitress charged me full price for another bowl because my baby ate two bites."}
{"text":"We had a group of about 18 so we put some stress on the service but all in all things went pretty well.

The food was OK, about what you'd expect from a small diner. We had everything from meat loaf to spaghetti to pancakes and of course the soup and salad bar.

I'd go again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Perfectly named, and just what I expected. I was a passin' through town and I had a hankering for a patty melt, and what should appear, but the Perry Family Restaurant. It's kind of hidden in the IGA plaza next to the BMV, so I was glad I saw the sign. I had a reasonably good patty melt with crispy fries. The service was perfunctory and adequate, but not really personable. There was a big salad bar, and an extensive menu with all you might expect at a family restaurant. Folks next to me were enjoying stuffed peppers & baked taters. Consistent with the family restaurant persona, there were booths or tables, chair rail blonde paneling, old pictures on the wall, and an all around local vibe to the place. It's nothing super special, but truly a nice place to stop for lunch. I'd much rather a spot like this than some chain or fast food spot. Glad I tried it. I'll be back to sample other menu items, and maybe a piece of pie."}
{"text":"Well, I've avoided coming here for some time because of the reviews.  I stopped in with my girlfriend for breakfast on a whim and we were quite surprised.  Service was fast and friendly, they kept our drinks full the entire time.  I got eggs, bacon, wheat toast and homefries.  My girlfriend got the breakfast bunch which included pancakes, eggs and sausage.  We both enjoyed our food.  Portions were generous, food was fresh and hot.  Prices are good, restaurant was clean.  We will be back here."}
