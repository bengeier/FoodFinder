{"text":"This place is a cool atmosphere, but makes the NASTIEST drinks... I'm so sad sitting here drinking a 9 dollar glass of sugar shit. Come here for pizza and fun but NOT the drinks. I really want a refund"}
{"text":"So... In fairness we came in after a concert, but there were only four tickets in the window. After watching a poor gentleman ask for his order twice and then note that another table had gotten there order first after ordering after him, his order appeared. And then mine was twenty min late. Not an awesome place after a concert."}
{"text":"My friends and I had just gotten to this place for the first time. We ordered a vodka red bull and Jameson and ginger. The male bartender charged us $14. We went back again and ordered the same thing, but this time it was just the women bartender. We watched her make the drinks and she literally didn't put alcohol in the Jameson one. She refused to remake it and then charged us $21. I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"I do give stars to the Karoke room and the awesome folks who run the music--they are fun and the stage is awesome--i am a karoke junkie and love to sing--my new favorite place--as most people know most places to sing are absolute dumps and sometimes the ones running the machine are not always pleasant--And they do have a great cocktail menu--creative libations--i am not a pizza eater but if you want a pie then you're all set--A my biggest plus is i can go early during the week -i don't have to wait til 930-10pm to sing--i believe they start at 6 or 7 at latest--yahoo--see you all soon"}
{"text":"Do not trust this establishment!!
I was attending the Kesha concert at the Fillmore when I noticed my phone was missing.  The last place I had it was in the bathroom at the bar next door, 8.2.0.  My sister quickly found their phone number and immediately called. I was standing right next to her as she explained to them which bathroom stall I had gone into, etc and she was put on hold twice. Once to \"see if anyone had turned it in\" and the second time the person \"went to check the bathroom.\" When they returned to the phone they stated nobody had turned it in and the bathroom had been checked with no sign of the phone.  Well, I went to look myself. And guess what? My 1,000$ phone was right where I left it.  
Now I work at an airport so I totally understand that sometimes people are too busy to check places for lost or forgotten belongings.... And if the person on the phone had said they did not have time to check and we should call back later or come by ourselves that would have been completely acceptable.
Instead I was lied to. Blatantly. I have a feeling that person was planning to pick up that phone later and keep it for themselves.  Smh.  It was my 1st time at this establishment and definitely my last !! 
Rest assured that I am a Charlotte native and everyone I know in Charlotte will hear this story!!!"}
{"text":"This place is such an incredible addition to the Music Factory!! We swung by 8.2.0 before seating a concert at the Filmore. So glad we did!

Right when we entered, we immediately veered to the food section. There was a lot on the menu, so the waitress helped us pick. We went with the pizza on cauliflower crust (yes, this is amazing that they do this!!), meatballs with their vodka marinara sauce, and some fries with gravy dipping sauce. They have lots of different sauces, it's a bit overwhelming! The pizza was absolutely delish, the meatballs were fantastic, and the fries were perfectly cooked. Everything was very good. Not like, bar food good, but legit good. After the concert, we definitely ended up at the outdoor window and ordered more meatballs and a slice of pizza. No judgement. 

We did get drinks while waiting for the food. My husband got the boba mixed drink and got me one of their mixed drinks on tap. Both were very tasty. 

Inside there are lots of tables, video games, a karaoke section. The best part is the hidden room. Not gonna tell you where it is but when you find it, I hope you will think it is as cool as we did. We played records for a bit and chilled!

VBGB, this was an amazing expansion. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I met a few friends here to celebrate my birthday month coming to a close...yep I celebrate the whole month!

We took a look at the drink and food menu. We went to the food counter and ordered. I had the cauliflower crust pizza. Delish! Wish it was a little bit more crispy. We ate and drank and talked. Speaking about drinks, cocktails on tap?!? Yesss....and I like that you can sample it. Another place I just went to recently had drinks on tap and we were not allowed to sample.

A nice server offered to give us a full tour. I love the hidden library and the event space. Then we ventured into the karaoke room. Fun! We had a ball laughing and still hot home in time since it was a weeknight. I will most definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first time.
This place is REALLY unique, Theres definitely no where else like this in Charlotte.
Parking is a breeze since its right across from VBGB (The music factory does parking right) and the bar itself is SO cool and beautiful.

You walk into an open room with a gorgeous chandelier and bar with seating. Then there is a separate little room to order food, There is also and arcade and Karaoke room. the coolest part is the secret room, and theres also a MASSIVE room with a ton of tables and couched. The place is huge, while feeling really intimate and cozy.

All of the ladies bartending were SO friendly and great, and the drinks were really good, they do cocktails on tap like Soul does, but I prefer these.

We ordered the fries and they were really good, but really heavy. I was starving and was convinced I needed one all to myself and i was very wrong. My friends got the pizza and said it was amazing.

We sat in the karaoke room for a while and the ladies running it were really fun, it costs $1 per song but was a fun environment, and the decor is great.
There is also a large patio that is really nice.

Our favorite part by far was the secret room. We had such a great night here, this place is one of a kind and definitely worth visiting. We used to love VBGB, and while it's still great, this place has a totally different vibe which i definitely prefer."}
{"text":"Eh this place is cool but there are better places to go. I had a Moscow mule and they shook up the drink to make it so that was a flag to me. They have champagne on tap which is pretty cool . They also have games and karaoke but you have to pay money to sing :/ they are also attached to a pizza place which is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Continuing the theme of surprisingly hip places opening up in the music factory.

I would definitely go as a pre-game before heading over to vbgb."}
{"text":"The pizza here was sssoooo good. Like I'd drive across town 30 minutes to get it again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are always looking for GOOD late night menus as we are night owls! We came across this place & fell in love. BEST pizza in charlotte, hands down. The owners also own VBGB next door so you are able to order pizza & take it across the street to eat their and drink awesome local beers on draft. They only have a few craft pizzas they've come up with... but that's all they need! Fries & the 15+ sauces they offer are out of this world! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"We went on a rainy and panthers football filled Thursday night so it wasn't busy at all which we were cool with because it's new and we really wanted to check it out. Less people meant we could see everything! 

The decor was stunning. Like seriously can you come and redo my house? White brick with black accents. White faux animal head on the wall and cool lighting fixtures all made the place modern and inviting all in one. 

You walk into a bar on your left that has a wall of built in shelves with back lighting and tons of liquor. They have a bunch of speciality cocktails to choose from here. Like drinks with mango and strawberry bursting boba and 'on tap' cocktails, which oh my goodness is such an awesome idea. They have a tropical vodka and red bull drink which is nice and fruit and an Arnold Palmer type alcoholic drink that was delicious too. My favorite drink by far was the green tea boba-Rita, fruity, fun and filled with mango boba! Just watch the bill a lot of the drinks are 10$..totally worth it but that can add up fast! 

To the left of that is a separate room where you can order food like pizza, (really good pizza not that frozen microwaved ,plastic cheese pizza. The kind of pizza you would wait in line for 30 minutes for pizza) French fries,(which are so crispy and delicious you won't know what sauce to pick for dipping) meat balls, and a few other options. Just know it's order and wait there to pick up your food type deal which I actually think work really well with how the place is set up. 

There's also a karaoke room, a small arcade room a second bar, a bunch of nook like seating spots. But I think the coolest spot was the 'hidden' lounge. We  had it to our selves!  It has velvet benches, book shelves, mood lighting and a record player that you can actually use! The vibe was so chill, it's a must see. 

This is a great place to take a date or to take a big group. There's enough space for big parties and enough intimate spaces for a great night for just the two of you. There is really something for everyone. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the space. The vibe was so easy going and fun. Please try the fried cauliflower! It's sooooooo good."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing and not just like \"Man, this bar pizza is tolerable enough to eat.\" Like genuinely, some of the best pizza I've had as of recent. Giovanna was extremely nice and helpful (considering my friend spilled multiple beers throughout the night). Melissa was killing it at the karaoke, DJ table thing (even though they didn't have Just a Friend by Biz Markie). Also Ms. Pacman is bae."}
{"text":"What a neat concept for a bar and a perfect addition to the music factory. This place has a little bit for everyone along with some unexpected features that make it a great place to take visitors.

We were first drawn here for dinner since it is right next to the Fillmore and we had tickets to Saturday night's show. Looking for something different than a pretzel  and beer cheese (even though we love VBGB), put our trust in the wait staff at 8.2.0 and were not disappointed. Winners were buffalo chicken pizza on a cauliflower crust and the meatballs. Definitely recommend the later. Also I found the drinks to be quite good. I got a boba tea mixed drink for me and a mixed drink on tap for my wife. Interesting concepts that were well executed.

Overall the space is what I appreciated the most. In addition to a sleek bar, patio, video game room, and back hosting room, there is also a neat hidden room. Good luck finding it, but it is worth the search as we played vinyl for a bit. Looking forward to coming back as this place is something truly different in the Charlotte scene."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite place in Charlotte

I use to think this was the perfect place. I loved the multiple rooms. 
We would come and try Karoke or order drinks and chat in the \"secret room\" (which i LOVE) and hang out until the DJ would play in the Paris Room.
The DJ's (Smoothitout and B-man) was great.  They would play all diff types of music, with limited or none profanity. Finally a place, where you can dance without it being overcrowded, but I was sad to find out, they have stopped all music.

I have brung many people from locals to ppl visiting from out of town, to 820 and it was the perfect spot.  Now without the music, it's not the same. 

Bring back the DJ's please."}
{"text":"While I didn't taste any of the food I can say the service and karaoke lounge are enjoyable. I was there 2/2 celebrating my birthday and all of my guests shared my sentiment. The only complaint I heard during the evening was the catalogue of song choices was limited. I did not personally see the book. Between dancing to the music and being summoned to the stage to dance to a battery of birthday related tunes, I did not have the chance. The booth rental is very reasonable and accommodating. I believe every guest ordered food so that must say something about the food as well. 

I plan on visiting again so that I can get the full experience. Thanks for making my birthday celebration a night to remember."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here on their opening night and loved it every since.
First, the atmosphere. Love the mixed crowd, a feeling of everybody is welcomed. The bars are nice, mixed drinks on draft are unique and taste great. Any place that has a secret library already gets extra points. Arcade is a good escape when you're tired of the bar. My favorite is the karaoke room! It can be a hit or miss some night, just depends on the crowd. I had my wedding afterparty here a couple of weeks ago and the deco fly didn't disappoint. My wedding guest were so in love with this place. Karaoke girls always does a great job at keeping the crowd entertained! 
Now the food. If you don't eat anything else, eat the buffalo cauliflower pizza! It never disappoints. Their regular pizza is also good and their fries and large selection of dipping sauces are sure to keep you coming back. A plus is they have a window you can order out of incase you don't want to come into the bar/ or if you're underage. 
All around a great place for a fun night!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Try the meatballs with vodka balls. They have a lounge, an arcade with classic games and a karaoke bar. This is my go to, I'm never sad when I come here. Check for Brett, he definitely knows what he's doing. I recommend this place for a comfortable, hip environment."}
{"text":"This is a rather cool addition to the music factory. I figured it would be since it's been put out by the owners of VBGB and they are very good at what they do! I haven't spent a full night here yet but for the time I was here I'm really liking it. There's a really great karaoke room and the woman who hosts the karaoke is wonderful. There's a game room and multiple bars and even a not so secret \"secret\" room. If you can't find something to do here then your doing it wrong!! I haven't tried the food yet but our corporate party in January is being hosted here so I know I'll have a chance to try everything and report back then!! The biggest hit of our night was probably the cocktails that have the boba pearls in it. They came across alcoholic and everyone loved them!! All in all I think this place will be a big success :)"}
{"text":"Excellent space, food and service! We visited for the first time to attend a holiday party which was held in their Paris room. The space was perfect for a private event and guests were still encouraged to make use of the other fun spaces including a game room with Skeeball, Ms. PacMan and other fun games, as well as the \"secret room\" and the Karaoke room. We loved that karaoke was offered but was in an enclosed space so that patrons weren't obligated to hear the signing if they didn't want to. The eclectic venue offers a little something for everyone and I can't wait to go back.

Their drinks are pricey in my opinion, but fun and unique, so they might be worth the splurge if you are a big cocktail fan. The offered several options on tap, as well as a bunch of bubble tea cocktails. I tried one with coconut, banana, and the cold brew they have on tap. It was delicious but I found it really sweet and rich so I was glad to try it but couldn't finish the whole drink. I adored the Prosecco on top, though it was $7 a glass.

The food was honestly incredible. I was blown away. We were lucky to be at an event where we got to taste much of the menu. The cauliflower balls, mixed with cheese and fried, then served with a vodka cream sauce were divine. They had a pizza roll-up appetizer that was great as well, and we loved the pomme frites with dipping sauces. We even had a buffet in addition to all that and everything was great- the mac and cheese, pasta, boneless wings, salad with strawberries and feta, and DIY pitas with mushrooms and or beef. 

This is definitely a great spot for food and drinks, and I would highly recommend it if you're looking for a fun event space with good food and drinks! I think it would a really fun place for a wedding rehearsal dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night. It was pretty packed like any other popular bar. The karaoke room had a long wait which was a little of a low light of the place. The highlight for me is the delicious drinks and amazingly good pizza they have. The green colored margarita I had with boba, and the hard coffee cocktail were outstanding but I felt the drinks were a little overpriced.

Pizza served here is surprisingly delicious. I tried the vegetarian and cauliflower base bbq chicken pizza and both tasted great. I am likely to return to eat pizza :)"}
{"text":"Good music and cheap drinks, what more can you ask for?

I love that this place is kind of sectioned off- you can hang out in the main bar area, or step into the arcade or karaoke room, or head to the pizzeria for some delicious pizza.

Great time and good crowd!"}
{"text":"I went here Saturday for Karaoke and I was shocked at how much fun I had. The venue had separate break off rooms karaoke, arcade, pool and pizza. Then the bar was out in the open. It was $1 to sign up for a song, but the wait to sing wasn't. Great prices and service. Perfect for a night out with a big group. I will definitely be returning next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to visit this new concept from Tom and Kara Taddeo (VBGB). We went on a Wednesday to make sure it wasn't slammed to be able to enjoy the ambience.

First off... everyone was super friendly, one of the servers took us around and showed us the entire space - it's impressive. The Karaoke room is nicely set up with a raised stage, fully set up for anyone to bust out a tune. The arcade room is a little small but has a few nice games if you are into that stuff. Over at the bar area you have a nice setup with chairs and lounge areas where you can congregate with friends. There is a secret 'lounge room' were people can go and enjoy drinks in a more private and conservative setting. They also have a couple of rooms for large reservations, parties, weddings, etc. that are pretty cool. 

Onto the drinks, I have to say I was excited about bobba cocktails... but none of them really did the trick. Moved to the cocktails on tap and BINGO! Their version of a Manhattan is really good (and real strong). That's where I stopped looking for my drink of choice. Note that they do not have any drafts on tap. 

I didn't have any of the food, but I saw some come out and that'll be on my next review. 

Overall, this place has something for everyone, I think it will be a really good time with friends for a night of fun."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The atmosphere, the food, the bar tender..... It's all unbelievable. If you haven't given this place a chance, you are doing yourself an injustice."}
{"text":"Review based off walk-thru window . 

If you don't want the whole shebang of a sit down experience this is the place for you ! ( Note: if you do want a sit down / chill zone this is also available for you inside . The decor inside is ultramodern. They offer both bar seating and dining seating .)

They have a window outside with a full menu board . You place your order and they will call out to you when it's finished . 

The food outside is made by the same cooks that do the food inside . Everything is made to order . Just because the food is in an convenient to go container doesn't mean it lacks any flair .

They have options for everyone here! 

The standout of the night for me was the cauliflower crusted Buffalo pizza ! It's amazing . Good for those watching carbs and still wanting flavor . 

Another standout for me was the meatballs ! Simply the best all around : extraordinary taste , extraordinary size and extraordinary sauce choice to pair them with ! 

A list of both sauces and dips are displayed on the menu board ! I suggest getting the 3 sauce deal . Sauce potions are huge so if your with a group you could get a few to share !"}
{"text":"I love the nighttime atmosphere! I mainly go to 8.2.0 for their karaoke nights. The hosts are very energetic and keep you entertained throughout the night. It's nice to see people from different backgrounds come together and enjoy a lil karaoke!"}
{"text":"Bang opposite VBGB... Loved the veggie pizza with eggplants and peppers ! Do try the selection of cocktails ! Must visit after vbgb"}
{"text":"Came excited to try the Cauliflower pizza. It was good not great. It's nice to have the low-carb option for the health conscious. 
The regular slices are small for the price..
Must say it's pretty neat they have Margaritas & speciality cocktails on draft. 
Overall left hungry and we both had 2 slices of pizza & shared carrots & celery with dip and 1 drink each and spent $40 bucks."}
{"text":"Have come in twice since my initial review.  Everything I said about the awesome Karaoke folks still holds.  But I'm a bit miffed about one thing that happened at each of the subsequent visits.  

(1) When ordering food, this time we were instructed to wait around and pick up our food rather than have it be brought to us.  We had ordered--as I tend to do--too much food for one person to carry.  And the place was still empty so there wasn't any reason not to come out to us.  We had to make multiple trips and they made impatient faces at us as we struggled to get utensils and condiments and napkins to boot.  Thanks, ladies.  The pizza was good, as usual, though.  They did screw up our loaded fries.  How does that even happen???

(2) There were bugs in my vodka.  Not one.  Four.  Four flies.  In my vodka.  And the bartender served it to me anyway.  When I pointed them out, she didn't believe me, then said, \"Oh, it's because it's the bottom of the bottle,\" indicating that she knew what this was because it happens all the time.  Seriously?  She promised my friend that her _next_ drink would be free because of this.  Not so!  She charged my friend full price for all three drinks (I didn't get another, as you can imagine...).

Will I come back for karaoke?  Heck yeah.  Will I eat more pizza.  Of course.  Will I be paying for insect-protein-added, overpriced drinks?  Nope.  You've lost the buzz due to bugs.  And (f)lies!

It might well be that without that extra boost of alcohol-fueled-fun, I'll just end up at Seoul on the regular...  We shall see!"}
{"text":"8.2Ohhhh my goodness! You can't visit The Music Factory without coming to this bar/restaurant. 8.20 offers delicious pizza options like the Buffalo chicken cauliflower crust pizza.

There is a hidden lounge area, which I couldn't find at first. I kept tapping the bookcase hoping it would move. Most people come here for the food and karaoke (if howling to strangers is your thing). Bottom line this place is awesome, I love coming here. Oh! Let's not forget the prosecco on tap! Yes, please! Be sure to enjoy the other drink specials."}
{"text":"Really cool spot located in the music factory. Game room, karaoke room, bar and restaurant area, and outdoor patio makes for a dynamic and fun atmosphere. Nice cocktail menu and the pizza is very, very good. Didn't get to try the cauliflower crust pizza but looking forward to returning and checking it out."}
{"text":"This is such a cool bar! I love the fact that they separate out the karaoke room so my inebriated attempts to woo the crowd weren't heard by everyone. And the gal who was running karaoke Thursday night was kind enough to come on stage and help me sing when I faltered. I don't karaoke often but I feel like every time I do whatever song I choose is a thousand times faster than it is when I sing along any other time.

The bar décor is completely on point. The main room has beautiful overhead lights and a long white bar. The event room they have toward the back has the cutest tree with lights on it as the center piece. My absolute favorite part was obviously the secret library! You enter through a false bookcase into a dimly lit room lined with more books and comfortable seating. I will know that I have won at life when I can put that in my house!

The only disappointment of the night were the drinks. The first one I tried was the gin fizz. While I am no stranger to a strong drink this tasted like straight gin, though it did have a little flavor from the fruit muddled at the bottom. Then I switched to the on tap cocktails which were better but nothing to write home about. Other people liked their drinks in my group so maybe I was just choosing poorly.

All said I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really like this place and I don't come here often enough. A large group of us spent New Year's Eve here and it was perfect! Not overcrowded, good drinks, good food, and so much to do between dancing, games and karaoke. Highly recommend if they do a package next year. 

This is a great option if you are hanging out in music factory before or after an event. Their pizza is really good! I love the buffalo chicken cauliflower crust pizza. Its inly $7 for a personal pizza, and its one of those things that is way too tedious to make at home. It also makes me feel less guilty about late night pizza. Every staff member I have encountered here, whether behind the bar or in the pizzeria has been extremely friendly. 

It is a beautiful space to check out whether you just want to camp out somewhere for a couple hours and watch/sing some karaoke and play games, or just pop in for a slice."}
{"text":"8.2.0 provides a nice bar option out by the music factory. I like that 8.2.0 has several rooms each with a different vibe - one with arcade games, one quiet lounge, etc. It provides an experience like bar hopping without actually having to hop. Also, they have karaoke which is one of my favorite bar activities.

The other highlight of 8.2.0 is the food. They serve pizza, fries, and meatballs (??), and the pizza and fries were both awesome. They offer about 20 different dipping sauce choices for the fries, from tzatziki to sriracha honey to s'mores. Cool concept and the fries themselves were done really well.

I wasn't a huge fan of their drink options. The featured cocktails were okay, but they did have a decent prosecco on tap. Would prefer to go drink beer at VBGB across the street, but overall a nice bar to hang out at."}
{"text":"I love to visit this place. This hidden gem might be over looked in the NC Music factory next to VBGB. They offer free parking in the lot across from VBGB (so convenient).

 There is a nice bar area, a area for food, a little arcade and a karaoke bar. The karaoke was soooo much fun. For $1 you can sing as many times as you would like but warning the wait list will be long. It is definitely worth the wait to perform and watch others perform after a few drinks. You won't be disappointed here.

I had the parmesan cauliflower bites with teriyaki sauce. The bites were delicous and I would order them again. Overall, I really enjoyed this place and I will be back."}
{"text":"What a fabulous addition to the NC Music Factory's restaurant scene! The cauliflower pizza was to die for! On top of the that, the cauliflower balls were heavenly. The service was great and atmosphere was relaxed and fun. The secret library room was also a fun spot to chat in. I felt like I was Mrs. Peacock in CLUE. Will def be going back."}
{"text":"As if an awesome bar w/ cocktails on tap, like Moscow Mules and Margs wasn't enough, they have video games, a closed off karaoke bar, easy parking in the fun music factory area of Charlotte and a hidden lounge behind bookcases with a free jukebox! Come on...what more do you need?!? Oh, they have great food, including cauliflower crust pizza, which seriously never expected and was awesome.

We were visiting Charlotte for a conference near the airport and this spot was recommended by a friend from Jersey since I'm always on the hunt for a speakeasy. The \"speakeasy\" portion is more of a lounging room so you hit up one of the bars, there were at least 2 that I saw, and then make your way back there. We never had an issue getting a seat and made friends back there each night (yes, we had to make a return trip it was so awesome).

Definitely recommended regardless of what scene you're looking for since there was plenty in the general area and whether early or late, this was an awesome spot!"}
{"text":"Went to a concert at the fillmore last night and stopped in 820. Great atmosphere. Lots to do. There's an arcade, secret rooms, pizzaria and a karaoke room. People were into it and having fun. Karaoke DJs were engaging and getting people involved. The pizza was pretty delicious and reasonably priced. Cocktail drinks slightly on expensive side. All and all a great fun place and is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and had a blast and we didn't even see the whole place. This place is awesome. It's all of your favorite things mixed in with some really innovative concepts. 

Came here on a Thursday evening while there was a concert next door at the Fillmore. Parking was a bit more cumbersome than I imagined but not all out outrageous. 

Started out with the bar. I'd done a bit of research and ordered the blue berry balls boba cocktail and my friend ordered the Long Island Iced Boba Tea. Mine was great and the boba gave a great textural complement. Their boba isn't the typical, gelatinous composition but rather a boba with a flavored liquid center. It was enjoyable nonetheless. The bar was initially very busy then the crowd dissipated and surged again. The bartenders were attentive throughout that ebb and flow which is great. 

We decided to try their pizza. Opted for the savory pepperoni whole pie. They have slices as well which is a great option for a late night snack. We ordered the pie at the counter and like any other pizza joint they gave us a number and  brought it out to table when it was ready. While waiting we opted for beer because you know pizza and beer are just a inescapable American thing. 

The cool thing is that all their beers are bottled and their taps serve their signature cocktails. Amazing! Definitely looking forward to trying those next time. Opted for a Duvel (yes they have Duvel!!) and waited for the pie. 

The pizza was wonderful. The crust had the perfect consistency which would best be characterized as a cross between focaccia and New York style. The sauce was definitely homemade and had that characteristic bright flavor. The pepperoni were spicier and a bit thicker  than conventional pepperoni and the whole pie was covered in grated Parmesan and fresh basil. It was  delicious to say the least.  Spent the rest of the evening chatting and enjoying the lively ambience of this place Didn't get to partake in all of the fun (i.e. karaoke and arcade) but I hope to return soon!! Great for a night out!"}
{"text":"This place is decent.  It's a little better than your typical boring bar scene.  It's huge inside, with different rooms and spaces to hang out depending on your mood.  There are also different bar areas so that the wait time is never too bad.  Customer service is ok, nothing to write home about.  They have specialty drinks on different nights and they are all strong!  A little pricey, but plenty of alcohol.

They have a game room, karaoke room, \"secret\" library-type room with a hidden door-pretty cool.  Then they have a dance space and a place for private parties.  I had a god experience and would definitely try it again or recommend to friends who are visiting."}
{"text":"Came here for a networking event and was surprised to see how big the space was! I could totally see myself renting this space out for a future event. They had us in the very back room where we were told that the large space could be divided up with these retractable walls.  Each wall featured a background that complimented it's name.  Very cool! It's in an area where there are many other venues, bars and food joints. So if you were to have an event here, there will be plenty to do! They had small apps set out.  The meatballs were amazing.  The pizza was average but that is what I expected.  I had a glass of wine so I can say much on any specialty drinks. I would definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Interesting spot with varying areas throughout the bar. Karaoke gets packed, dance floor, pizza shop, arcade. Minimal seating but fun for a group. Not many beer options when we visited, but otherwise a cool place to be on Friday/Saturday nights."}
{"text":"We came through for the birthday of a friend and had an absolute blast! 

Whatever you want, this place got it. Food? Yep! Drinks? Absolutely. Karaoke? Fo sho. Arcade games? You know it! 

On top of all this, there's a separated library space where you can chill out if you just want a quiet night. There's another room that I believe can be rented out for private events. They had a DJ there the night we went and we sat to enjoy him for quite a while.

The music in the main area was top notch as well. It covered hits from so many genres that it was easy to sing along all night. 

The drinks were really tasty. My server convinced me to go with one of the bubble teas and I was not disappointed. If you're dragging on the night you go in, they've got cocktails with a Red Bull and coffee as well! Bonus!

Note: We didn't order any food this time, but we'll make a point to do it next time. The best part of the menu? They list their meatballs as Balls. I'm easily amused and not ashamed. Sue me."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this bar. I'm from Miami and we have plenty of bars and lounges so I went in not expecting much. I was pretty surprised to see the size once I stepped in. They have different areas including a pizza parlor, arcade, outside area, and karaoke. The drinks are well made and the bartenders were pretty friendly. My favorite part was a hidden room behind a bookshelf. Felt like I went back 50 years into the speakeasy times. Looking forward to coming back here next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Never in my life have I been treated like I was tonight by the bouncer. I was kicked out of the bar while I was sitting calmly in the bar drinking water. The bouncer was an absolute asshole and I've never been treated so poorly. We asked to speak to the supervisor and they would not allow us to. Instead they said they called the cops on us. I will never give this place business ever again and will strongly encourage others to avoid this place. They have the worst customer service of a place of business I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Came back and had such a great time! Didn't partake in any karaoke so I just watched others. No complaints and there was plenty of seating in the front at the bar thingy. 

Beer was nice and cold and the bartender was great. Didn't get any food this time but I saw they had a different special this time. 

Glad I returned and will definitely keep this spot on my list of places to go in town."}
{"text":"Love this place. When you just want to get out the house and have a little fun this place is always in my top picks. The atmosphere is so friendly and inviting. The first bar is very chill and the drinks on tap are so good. Then they have a room where they serve pizza & fries with an array of dipping sauces, the Buffalo chicken cauliflower pizza is a must! They have a window outside Incase your underage & want to grab some food too! They have a hidden room where it's very intimate, grab a drink and find the door to chill out in there. And then the best part the karaoke room! Even if your too shy to perform you will still have a great time in there. Some nights the wait is really long to get to your name to perform and other nights it's not just really depends. The ladies hosting always makes sure the crowd is entertained as well."}
{"text":"A couple Saturdays ago, a girlfriend and I stopped to check out this new spot.  We got there around 9PM, and were immediately impressed with what we saw.  The Edison light bulb chandelier lit a beautiful interior, wide open floorplan, and clearly sectioned into separate rooms with different themes - quite a brilliant concept allowing multiple groups and parties to have their own spaces.  While there were probably a good amount of guests there, it felt wide open.

A bartender approached us, handed us drink menus and asked us how we were.  The menu had so many options, so I asked her for her favorites.  She recommended a few things and answered all of our questions about certain items.  I told her that I appreciated that she knew her menu, as it seems to be less prevalent in food and beverage industry than I would expect these days.  I ordered the Berry Blue Balls, sans Blue Curacao, as I didn't want the syrupy sugary feel.  It was DELICIOUS!  I liked that it was clear without the curacao, as the boba (bubbles in the bubble tea) looked really pretty just dispersed throughout the glass.  The drink was perfect, the venue was super cute and I will definitely be back when I can stay longer. 

If you have any questions about the menu, ask for Yoshi, she was great!"}
{"text":"Had the chance to check this place out last weekend before a show at the Fillmore. Loved it! We need more bars like this in Charlotte. Loved the variety, and that there are rooms designated for different activities. It wasn't super crowded - I think because it was early, and not sure if many people know that this place exists yet. I would be curious to see what the crowd (and the karaoke lounge!) looks like late-night."}
{"text":"First off i want to start by saying i didn't even know this place existed. Like at  all! I attended a women's brunch yesterday at this hideaway restaurant/bar in the music factory round about. The event was very successful. I would like to come back here on just a regular day with no events going on. Cool set up when you come in the first room you pass is an arcade and it seems and appears like its so much more to this place but where the event was held we were led straight to the back where everything was set up wonderfully for the event. I will come back here and actually try some of the establishments food because the food that was supplied for us was coordinated by the events caterer's.I also discovered they have karoke here and have an entire sepearate room for that as well i will definitely find my way back here. I am the karaoke queen!"}
