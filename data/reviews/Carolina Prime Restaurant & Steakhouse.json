{"text":"Took a day 'adventure' trip with our two children and ended up near South Blvd.  I had driven by this restaurant many times and thought it would be nice to try.  This was on a Monday, so when we arrived about 8pm, it wasn't very crowded.  The d√©cor is a little over the top, but most steakhouses tend to be that way.  The menu had lots of options, but seemed pricey.  We decided to stay and give it a try.  Out of our group, we ordered 2 steaks.  I ordered a large prime rib to split with my wife and my 8 year-old daughter got the kids sirloin (I would guess It was a 4oz steak).  An hour passed and I had gotten my salad and we had gotten some bread and that was about it.  Finally, after another 10-15 minutes, we got our meals.  My daughter's steak was raw and the prime rib was an end cut and was dry and well done through about half of the cut and then a light pink in the very middle only and overall very dry.  Not the way a prime rib should be cooked.  I proceeded to tell the waitress about the steaks and she offered to bring us 2 more.  I told her we couldn't wait another hour for our steaks and she said she would get them out as soon as possible.  At this point, the manager/owner came over and told me he thought the prime rib looked fine and he would throw the small sirloin back on the grill.  He also stated that the delay was because they cook the meat to order.  First of all, you don't cook a prime rib to order.  They should already be close to the correct temperature and then finished off as the orders come in.  It was obvious that the piece was cut off an uncooked prime rib that was in the fridge and then put in the oven to cook it quickly and then put on the grill to finish it.  It was cooked and well done on all sides, so there was no cut from the rest of the rib.  My daughter's steak was only 4oz, so how long does that take to cook?  I don't see that it would take an hour for what we ordered, so he tried to tell us something that wasn't true.  The point is that he wanted to argue with me that the prime rib was fine when it was burnt and crusty on the outside and dry on the inside.  He lost that argument as we decided to leave until he handed me a check for a salad, drinks and the side my wife had ordered to go with the prime rib.  Another 15 minutes passed until clearer heads prevailed and the lady at the front told us to not worry about it.  I will never come back when he tried to give us a line about the delays and the quality of the food.  You shouldn't offer something you aren't prepared to present with your best quality.  Cutting the end of a prime rib and trying to make it a prime rib in an hour doesn't work and just frustrates your customers.  Don't lie and just tell the truth.  We would have stayed and tried to enjoy our meal if you just hadn't want to come over and argue with us about our meal.  Poor customer service, overpriced food for the quality and long waits just aren't worth it.  I would avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"The establishment was recommended by the hotel front desk.  We were seated promptly.  We ordered drinks, an appetizer and later our meal.  The salads came first, then the drinks followed by the app and soon after the entree.  We never had time to enjoy the Artichoke Crab dip.  My wife had ordered rice as her side and was never told the dish came on a bed of rice.  The waitress just said, oh - I forgot to tell you.    When we left we told the hostess, who told us we should have told her earlier.  Poor service, so so meal, don't bother"}
{"text":"Great service; average food with good portions.  All in all, fairly forgetable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner. Steak was over cooked, the vegetables were clearly from a frozen bag and over cooked so they were soggy. The side of rice was horrible and tasted like it came out of a box. I would not recommend going here."}
{"text":"I live nearby and go here a few times a month. The service is good the place is clean. My fav is the steak salad or the shrimp dinner. I give three stars because the steaks are nothing to rave about. If that is what they want to be known for, they are not doing a good job!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why the reviews are so bad for this restaurant! We absolutely love coming here. The prices are really comparable, and the food is wonderful! My boyfriend and I enjoy coming here for our date nights. It has nice ambiance, good service and food. Comparing this to Texas Road House, I would always choose Carolina Prime. It's not too loud, when I ask for a medium rare steak, that is exactly what I get...never have had to send it back. My boyfriend likes RARE steaks, and that is exactly what he gets. The appetizers are wonderful...the desserts are good too. This is one of the most inexpensive steakhouses I have seen, and the value is way past what you pay!!   OH...and last time we went, we both had burgers. Their burgers were hot and juicy...definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews or even average reviews.  We just moved from out of town and took a chance on the Weekend special.  Prime rib for 12.95. 10oz. That's crazy talk. And it's dang delicious.  I'm a serious food critic and this place rocked my palate.   Other yelpers are calling it  \"mom and pop,\" but I do not agree. It is classic western style with a charming steakhouse feel.   Ask for Benita! She's amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I just ate the best Steak & egg breakfast, ever !   10oz dinner ribeye cooked perfectly, extra crispy hash browns, eggs cooked the way I wanted, and bakery style buttered whole wheat toast.  Friendly quick service, too. For $11.00. WOW !!!"}
{"text":"First time. We got there around 6 on Saturday night and we were seated immediately. Waiter was really personable and made recommendations. Got the calamari, rib eye and bacon wrapped shrimp with pepper jack cheese, and smothered chicken. It was a ton of food, more than we could finish - which was equitable to the price. All of the food was good and didn't take long at all. Finished off with some specialty cheese cake. Tea wasn't quite as sweet as I like but that's just me. Will be back next time we are in town for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent Breakfast Spot!!!  Had breakfast here several times, $5.35 special is very hard to beat: eggs, meat, potatoes, bread.   Huge serving!  Bacon and home fries are great!"}
{"text":"When you have the word \"prime\" in your name, out of everything else on your menu, you should do steak well. If you don't know the difference between medium, medium well, and well done, then maybe you should stick to some other type of item.   My server was nice enough and very pleasant to deal with. If I understand it however, the owner is the also cook... Not pleasant to deal with. I ordered a 12 ounce ribeye medium well. After being brought one that was medium rare with a cool bloody center, I was then brought a skinny cut that was completely brown all through, overcooked for even well done.   I did not ask for the cook and I was content enough to just eat my meal and go about my business. But the server insisted that she get him for me. But when he came out he seemed incredulous that someone would call into question the quality,  and at that point I was resigned to the fact that my burnt piece of beef was punishment for questioning the first one.  I'm content to just not ever return.  I do wish them the best and I hope that other customers have had better experiences."}
{"text":"George's food is always excellent. One of the specials was a blackened grouper and shrimp in a tarragon cream sauce and it literally melted in my mouth."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night.  The service was excellent and very prompt. The meals were fine and delivered in a timely fashion. The prices were on the low to moderate side for a steak house. The atmosphere was a like an old school steak house with the red booths but clean and kind of homey.  The reason I did not give this place 4 stars is really more of competition thing in Charlotte with so many steak houses to choose from it is a little harder to separate your self from the rest. This place is better than the chains (Outback) and similar to the Texas Road house."}
{"text":"I have read the reviews on Carolina Prime and am a little surprised at how stupid some of these folks are.  This is a Mom and Pop steakhouse on a busy road off the interstate in a building that used to be a fast food or Mexican place.  Do NOT go here expecting Morton's.  Our steak was inexpensive and lived exactly up to expectations... well cooked and delicious... but not amazing.  The servers were really nice and the hostess and manager (obviously the owners) were great.  The dressings are homemade and to die for.  The baked potato was \"old school\"... creamy and perfectly done.  These are nice folks doing their best.  I hear the breakfast is top notch.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very nice independent steakhouse.   Food was excellent (we had filets).  Staff was friendly and very attentive.  We will go again."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday evening. Service was absolutely horrendous. Waitress did not ask what temperature I wanted my steak and and it was served to me raw - like my steak was still purple red. We had to wait another 10 minutes before we could even find a server, not even our waitress, to tell them about my steak. The second try was still half raw and the owner argued with me about the cook on a medium rare steak. I ordered one glass of wine and after 15 minutes, asked the waitress if she got my original request. Waitress said they were slow because there was only one bartender - on a busy Saturday night. In our 1.5 hour visit, we never got a refill. And the table beside us, who came after us, got their food almost right after us and were ready to go when we were, also never got refills. As a former waitress, I understand the challenges of a busy night but at least one refill is basic waitressing 101.  Food was nothing special, but the experience left even less to be desired. Womp womp."}
{"text":"Great service and great food at decent prices! Lovely local restaurant, we enjoyed the menu options but ended up getting a surf and turf special. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"We went for Queens Feast.  Special was Filet Oscar, served with sweet potatoes with fried potato leaves, tossed salad, and dessert.  My friend ordered from the menu & had a Ribeye with sauteed mushrooms.  We were there fairly late, around 8:45 pm,, & were seated in the bar area.  Service was attentive, food came out quickly.  The steak was cooked as ordered, but it was impossible to taste the steak. I was looking forward to the crab, but there was none!  It didn't even have a crab flavor, imitation or otherwise!   The steak was overwhelmed by the flavor of the sweetened sweet potatoes that it was served over.  The \"potato leaves\" did little to garnish the dish.  The cheesecake was plain, and taste was fair at best.  The sauteed mushrooms tasted like old grease.  If you want a steak, go to Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Steak dinner was cook to perfection. Salt and pepper and that is all. Staff was great and friendly.  We will be back. Well worth the money to have a great steak."}
{"text":"Great service. But sub par steak. Not the highest quality of beef. Steak also had a cut in it to check doneness. Which is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Amazing food, reasonable pricing, impeccable service. The best part is it is very casual and perfect for the business traveler."}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff for breakfast, good western omelet, and always topped off coffee -- really can't get better than that. I'm happy I made my way to the restaurant and definitely will return it I am in the area."}
{"text":"As usual I agree with Amy C, this place is a solid lunch spot. The food is definitely a solid 3.5 but the great service bumps them up to a very respectable 4 stars.   My co-workers and I arrived a little before noon and were seated immediate. Our waitress was fantastic, I can't remember her name but she was so kind and accommodating it was like we were in her home eating. She checked on us and served us with such ease. It was awesome.   I liked the amount of options that this restaurant offered and the fact a there are quite a few lunch specials daily. After a quick review of the menu, I decided to go with their special which was a chicken taco salad in a tortilla shell, with corn, black beans, pico and cheese with your choice of dressing. The salad was huge and there was plenty of chicken to keep me full! My co-workers all ordered something different and everything on the table looked so good.  We were in and out in no time, so I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good meal, you have a hungry group of people that all want something different and you want to pay a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Sorry, but this is clearly \"old people food\" -- everything poorly seasoned and half-assed.  I made the observation that bad steakhouses always have bad knives too, which makes it just more apparent that a restaurant selling a $20 steak has access to lower-quality beef than your average consumer as you sit there trying to buzz saw your way through the gristly bits.  I'm certainly my strip wasn't USDA choice (let alone \"prime,\" places will put that in the name to give people who know what it means a good laugh) because I've never struggled more to work my through a New York strip.  I had the special consisting of a NY strip (and trust me, \"old\" NY strip doesn't automatically turn tough and miserable, it gets better--this was just bad quality meat)  with peppercorn sauce, shrimp, and two sides.  The steak itself had no discernible seasoning layer and had anemic grill marks.  I could do better on a teflon pan, some kosher salt, and a pepper grinder.    The peppercorn sauce had zero flavor, just a fatty insipid liquid, and no visible cracked or whole peppercorns.  Trust, peppercorns are delicious, they soften up, and absolutely belong in a peppercorn sauce.  Clearly they had blessed the sauce with a few shakes from a disposable peppershaker but the sauce tasted like failure and missed opportunity.  They recommended sauteed spinach which I can eat all day.  I'm eating some right now that took me 3 minutes to make using the same pan as the $4 sirloin I picked up at the grocery store, which is killing that NY strip I had.  No hint of seasoning, no garlic chunks, just some watery spinach that had been clearly sitting in a steam table.  Seriously, sauteed spinach is a great thing and the idea is that you sautee it to order, and it takes all of 3 minutes, and if you're not serving it to grandma, you load it up with sauteed garlic and salt and pepper, you make that spinach pop, it is delicious.  Not here.  All said and done, I suspect everything on the menu should come down by 1/3 in price and drop \"prime\" from the name.  On par with Lone Star, Bonanza, Sizzler, etc.  Why don't these places know you can make amazing steaks with a hot cast iron or stainless pan?  They always manage to completely botch a good seasoned layer of steaky goodness."}
{"text":"Great deal and atmosphere.  The bar area could be a little bigger and overlook the restaurant but now I'm being picky.  For the price of premium items on the menu, like coconut crusted shrimp and fillet tips, this place is a great low key date spot or a steak night with carnivorous friends.  Of course vegetarians might not be too happy but everyone else will."}
{"text":"Good service, nice and quaint place. Not an upscale steak house, more of a neighborhood friendly establishment. Food was good, but you can tell the cuts are USDA Choice, and 14oz Ribeye is not a thick cut. But everything was cooked appropriately."}
{"text":"I had to drop BillyB. off at the airport 630a Tuesday, (gads) so I decided to try Carolina Prime, never have I eaten there, just curious of the large sign that reads: \"breakfast, lunch & dinner! hmmmm, really nothing to lose, I often wonder why we take food so seriously.   I walk in and it's dark, with booths of red vinyl. Seems like the kind of restaurant that would have a buffet. It was cozy and quiet upon entering, but then the organ music kicked in, it would have been very pleasant if they weren't rockin' the house with freakin' organ music Jingle Bells, I Saw Mama Kissing Santa Claus, there should be rules about holiday music and stricter rules if the sun isn't up.   I ordered breakfast and coffee, very reasonably priced. Typical fare of waffles, pancakes, french toast, eggs, bacon, steaks and hashbrowns. I will go back, maybe I will wait till January, when this madness is over. Suck it, Jingle Bells."}
{"text":"One of the best meals we have had while visiting Charlotte. There is nothing fancy about the restaurant, but the food is excellent. Juicy flavorful steaks and great sides. They also make their own salad dressings and they were awesome. And even though the food is wonderful, the best part was the service. We had Miss Bonita and she did such a great job. She made us feel like we were long lost friends. She was also very intuitive and thought of things we may need and delivered them before we even had to ask. We look forward to coming back for the great food and even better service!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this but this \"meal\" has my blood boiling. We ordered five medium rare steaks of varying cuts and the meat was completely raw. The steaks, I'm sure, have been frozen for months before being served. Inedible would've been a compliment for this meat. Overpriced and terrible. The song Hurt by Johnny Cash is requisite listening after visiting this establishment.   The service, however, was wonderful. The waitress was charming and quick."}
{"text":"Eh, it was okay.  Not really what I expected after reading the other reviews. Our waitress seemed distracted and didn't really check on us, and kind of rushed us out despite the place being seemingly slow.   Steak was decent, sides were average, atmosphere lacking. I just expected more. Nothing to really draw me back. My friend was also disappointed with his steak too. Over seasoned, a little burnt, fries were decent, but those are hard to mess up...   Maybe it was an off night, but I don't think I'll be back. But won't tell you not to try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Food was very good, beer was warm. Service was good. We had the burger and fries it was very good and juicy. When in the area we will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I work nearby and within the last year my job has ordered lunch for us at least 5 or 6 times from Carolina Prime. It has never dissapointed. I have had Cheeseburgers, Chicken Sandwiches, 1/4 Chicken platter with stuffing and Potatoes. And a Prime Rib. Everything is fantastic. Nothing bad I can say about the food."}
{"text":"let me start by saying the greek man who own's or manager the place is a extreme racist.. i would have gave this place negative 5 stars if i could..i should have know when i saw fox news playing on ever tv.. but still tried to give this place a chance.. if your non white beware of this racist establishment,....(be careful you been made aware) ps. the food is extremely blame bottom line its just garbage...."}
{"text":"Good quality food.  Reasonable prices. Attentive staff.  Place was not very busy when I visited, but definitely worth a repeat or making a regular if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Great restaurant that makes you feel like family. My sisters found this place for a baby shower for me and my fiance. Everyone in the establishment was great. They made us feel really welcomed and at home. The wings, cheese fries, spinach dip and salad were all great. We booked the private area and everything was to our satisfaction."}
{"text":"My colleague and I have been traveling to the area for several weeks in a row for business. It is a task when you eat out daily week to week trying to find something different than the usual chain or fast food fare. Not in the mood to go very far, we were going to settle for Bojangles' when my colleague passed it and turned into Carolina's parking lot instead. I was skeptical at first and since it was around 4 pm, the parking lot was almost empty. Well, I was in the mood for a good dinner after a long day at work and this place fit the bill. The food was delicious! Homemade crab cakes, vegetables, garlic potatoes, stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon, steak tips... I enjoyed it all. Our waitress Tracy was very attentive and gave us everything we needed (napkins and condiments) without us having to ask. The location was not too far from our hotel. I now have a new place to eat with real, flavorful food like what I would make at home. I look forward to coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Date of my visit: 7-March-2017 Time of my visit: Dinner  I did not want to go too far for dinner and could not decide on food, so after a quick glance at the menu, I picked this place.  As I entered, I was greeted by the hostess and seated immediately.  My waitress came over almost right away.  She was very upbeat, perky and very helpful.  I ended up ordering ribs with steak fries.  The fries were pretty good, definitely above average, the ribs were descent as well.  They were not the best, but not the worth either, about average.  Customer service was absolutely awesome! A solid B experience."}
{"text":"Carolina Prime is good for a lunch-hour meal and is relatively consistent.  While the food is a solid 3.5.  The friendly wait staff, who are mindful of potential time constraints during the lunch rush, push it to a 4 in my book for the type of establishment that it is.    Located on Woodlawn near the Old Pineville intersection, Prime has been here for many years serving breakfast (which I have never had here), lunch (which I have had every couple of months for years) and dinner (which I have never had here).  I typically have the chopped sirloin special with onions and gravy (hold the mushrooms) along with a salad and another side (mac and cheese special, fried squash, potatoes, rice, etc.) for $9 + drink.  The london broil special, served over rice with 2 sides for $12, is also quite good.  I love that they put their salads in chilled bowls, which keeps them cold and crunchy.  The sides always taste homemade and fresh.  While you are waiting for your meal, a sliced loaf of warm bread is a nice treat.  The tea is southern sweet.  If you still have room for dessert without taking off your pants, their sweet treats are also quite good.  (Pepsi products are served - bleh)."}
{"text":"I thought the food quality was pretty good and really priced well.  The place however is very odd.  Very authentic old west bar.  It seems to have maybe Russian ownership and they seem to try hard.  I noticed there were a lot of new employees that had not at all been trained.  They were nice, but I was definitely neglected and had to raise my hand to order another drink.  Still the value was good!  The best item was the Buffalo Shrimp, very tasty and large shrimp!"}
{"text":"I am never on this side of town in the am but I had an am meeting so I stopped her for breakfast.  For like $6 total I had a huge meal that was delicious as well! Bacon, cooked crispy with no rubbery portions at all. Potatoes were nicely chucked and seasoned. Eggs and toast were super. Service was quick and courteous.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is the simple tradition breakfast. It's great, and servers are friendly. I got lunch here too, and the diamond tip beer tenderloin and veggies were delicious."}
{"text":"I was disappointed.  They have a decent $12 steak. But it costs $22.  The 14 oz. ribeye was thin, over cooked and not flavorful.  The broccoli was undercooked and bland.  The server was great, fast and friendly, so there was that.  But at the end of the day, when you go to a steakhouse you want a  great steak.   CP didn't have it."}
{"text":"Carolina Prime was a great choice for a late lunch. It was quick and tasty and Cindy was such a great waitress. She was so friendly and really made us feel welcome--like old friends. The food isn't necessarily 5 star cuisine, it's very down home. But I had to give this place 5 stars based on service alone  Btw, the Cajun pasta is super spicy. I really liked it, but if you're hoping for that weak Cajun stuff, you aren't going to find it here.  And their homemade ranch is awesome!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here right before checking into the hotel  it was 1:00 and the place was pretty empty. It was pretty dates but I guess that added to the old rustic charm. We were created very nicely and seated right away. I ordered the shrimp wrap in pita bread that was far see with tomatoes, onion, cheese, and their tiki sauce. It also came with large steak fries and a tiny cup of slaw with a dill wedge on top. The salmon was slightly over old and not really seasoned but the sandwich was filling. I had a little extra sauce to come because of the dry meat. The fried needed salt but they camera. T. T. T  hot. Even though the slaw was just a spoonful I didn't care for it because it had pickles in it. Yuk. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. I gave it a three because there was nothing special about this place. The prices were reasonable and the food filling. I would not return unless I was in the area and needed food to just fill me up. Bojangles is within walking distance anyway."}
{"text":"The parking lot was full so I assumed that there were customers inside and that it might be a decent meal. I had been there once before but it was a long time ago I had forgotten my experience. Inside you will find it very very confused restaurant. They don't know if they want to be a steakhouse  or a bar or a club. The waitstaff seems friendly but there is a lot of arguing going on behind the scenes you can see it spilling over into the dining area. The service is slow. The food is slow. None of the food they came out of the kitchen was hot. Even after I explained of this to the waitress she explained that some things from the kitchen weren't going to be that warm. In the end it was a very expensive dinner. I had to find someone to take my money because our waitress had disappeared for about 20 minutes and never come back to the table after dropping off the check . The manager who took the money didn't seem very happy about it. Will never be going back to this place again. It's just bad and how they stay open I do not understand."}
{"text":"I was here on a business trip and went with a co-worker based on her recommendation.  It was better than I expected.  The place was not busy on a Tue night at 7pm...  I got the salmon dinner with garlic mashed potato and saut√©ed spinach.  I liked the salmon a lot.  It was on a bed of rice.  The mashed potato and spinach were good.  Only negative was that the hot tea I ordered was luke warm and the additional water in the kettle was also warm, not hot...    Other than that, I enjoyed the dinner and the service.  I will come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Sometimes, there are just some places that escape my review list and this was one of them. I swore I wrote a review and also added pictures for this restaurant, but it seems like it disappeared? Or have I just written so many reviews that sometimes some slip through my radar and I thought I wrote a review, but didn't? For the fact, I've been here I believe 3 times and this past weekend was the most recent. I've had their burger, and prime special breakfast along with tastings of the prime rib and pork chops. The pork chops are one of my parents' favorites.  Anyways, this one will be simple. Carolina Prime Restaurant & Steakhouse is a favorite for my parents because well they serve good meat/steaks for brunch and also overall serve good food. Inside, it's a rodeo. It's basically old school kind of steak house and there's booths everywhere. There is a bar area where you can sit and drink and have televisions lined up.   The menu is pretty straight forward. Except for the fact that I read one incorrectly. The first time I came I looked at their Carolina Prime Special Breakfast and got confused when I read the description: \"Two Eggs, any style, with Pork Sausage, Bacon, Livermush, Link Sausage / Turkey Sausage or Turkey Bacon, Hash Brown Potatoes, Home Fries or Grits, Toast or Biscuit.\" So does this mean that My two eggs comes with pork sausage, bacon, livermush, (my choice of link or turkey sausage or turkey bacon), hash brown potatoes, (my choice of home fries or grits), and (my choice of toast or biscuit)??! That's a lot of meat and options on that plate (was what ran through my mind). And ultimately that's what I got.  Sadly. That's not what I got. This is what I got... Just turkey bacon, because that's what I saw and thought those were my choices. I think it should probably read like \"with ONE or TWO of these options:\" That would've cleared everything up. Grammar is important! Anyways, if you're like me, you want to watch out.  The food was good, however on the third visit the burger was a little overcooked for a medium rare. But it was medium, so I don't really mind. I didn't have any problems and the service was good. Definitely a good brunch spot for us, and will probably come back as long as my parents are enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"Great steak for the price. I would definitely come again for the fillet and Copper beer."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with 2 of my friends. I had been many years ago for dinner and remember it as a old style steak house. It still is as nothing seemed to have changed. 2 of us had the ribeye steak sandwich and they were very good even if the steak was just a tad smaller then I would have like. But well cooked and seasoned. It did come on a very good roll. My Buddy had the Open Face Prime Rib sandwich. He asked for it to be cooked medium but sure more well done. He also thought it was very over salted. But that could have also been the brown gravy that was over the sandwich and mashed potatoes that it came with. Over all we had a good meal."}
{"text":"I have only been here for breakfast/brunch.  The portions here are huge, so come hungry. I enjoyed the french toast and the hash browns.  However, the white bread toast that comes as an option with the eggs dishes isn't that good."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this restaurant before, my pirate group had an event here. This is the type of place that looks like it's been around for while and probably has a rush right before 5 p.m. We were able to get a group of 25 accommodated on a Saturday night and even then they didn't seem that busy.  The interior seems a little outdated. We did appreciate the ship decor since we were pirates, but it didn't make sense.   The menu had a variety of items. We had cheese fries to start. They were decent. The fries were a thick cut and came out on a sizzling plate. The cheese was just melted on top. They were a little bland for me. I also had the Mediterranean pasta which came with a side salad. The pasta was good. It had spinach, artichokes and tomatoes in a lemon sauce over penne. The penne was a little over cooked. The vegetables were good, but the artichokes overpowered everything. I wish some feta and kalamata olives were added to the dish. The salad was basic, but the Greek dressing was yummy.   Service was okay. Refills seemed a little slow. I did appreciate that the food came out in order and they didn't have to shout every order to see who's it was.   We had a good time, but I  just wasn't impressed. I've heard lunch time is decent too."}
{"text":"I would not recommend, Charlotte has some great restaurants this isn't one of them  Friends ordered the BBQ Plate looked and tasted like it came out of a plastic tub and thrown on a grill to sear it. I on the other hand splurged for a $29 9 oz Filet was probably the worst filet I have ever eaten. Every table around us received bread, when I asked the waiter where our bread was he said you don't get bread unless you ask, how am I supposed to know to ask for bread. This establishment should not call themselves a steak house, not sure what they should call themselves.   On a positive note the Beer was cold, the side salad was a good size and spinach artichoke dip was ok  Sorry to be so critical but if I'm spending 40.00 on a meal would like it to be edible"}
{"text":"Okay, I don't get why there is so much criticism regarding this joint.  The minute I walked in I was treated with that southern hospitality that I have learned to expect in Charlotte. So this is not Ruth Chris, however I can say the steak entrees I saw looked amazing, my burger was the best that I have had in a LONG time.  Seriously, fresh hand made patty grilled to order and so flavorful! * nom nom nom*. I almost ordered another one.  The girls that were work here are not only adorable (think kittens with a ball of yarn), but super sweet and attentive. Bonita was my server tonight and she was anything but mediocre. She dazzled me the minute I sat down. This place is authentic as it gets in terms of \"mom and pop\" steak houses. I\"ll take Carolinas Steak House over the Outback, LoneStar or any other pretentious chain.  If you want a great meal and FANTASTIC service, look no further than this quaint little place.  And for the critics who think this place has bad service, try finding this kind of (sincere) hospitality in any other joint in the country! Thanks Bonita!"}
{"text":"What a great lunch spot!  I have never eaten dinner here, but I love to eat lunch here.  They have a lunch menu where everything is about 10 bucks, and it's legit.  Full on southern style meals.  More food that you should eat really.  My most recent visit, I got the Marinated London Broil (11.99, big spender) and it was really really good.  Perfectly cooked.  The sides were excellent as well.  The service was good.  Atmosphere is a little stuffy for me, with white table clothes, ect.  But that's the vibe they want.  I have a feeling that paying dinner prices, I would be less impressed, but for lunch it is very good."}
{"text":"We have eaten here on several occasions but for some reason the quality of the food  has changed. We usually get the prime rib special and noticed that the price went up but the size stayed the same. On the last two visits we ordered it and asked for it to be medium, it was not even close to medium and the meat was lukewarm. This was the second time that we experienced the poor quality of the meat so we won't be spending anymore money eating there. We also noticed that there are hardly anyone eating in the restaurant so I guess that's why."}
{"text":"I am new to Charlotte and have been searching for an affordable steakhouse. We definitely found it here! The food is excellent, the prices are very reasonable and the service is fantastic. My only ultra minor complaint is that I ordered a classic martini and it was a little warm, so next time I will make sure to ask for a chilled one. If I lived closer, I would come here on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Hostess was so sweet to usher me as a solo diner to the bar area and make me feel comfortable. The bartender is clearly an experienced lady who knows how to take great care of her customers and make them feel at home.  Has a traditional steakhouse feel, lots of wood and a large bar back.  Steak was slightly under cooked for medium rare.  Some of the sides were either bland or a bit oily."}
{"text":"Met family from out of town for a \"catch up\" dinner.  The 8 of us were immediately seated. Place was not crowded. Server got and brought our drink order quickly.  Told us about dinner specials, and took our order.  Salads came quick.  We had ample time to catch up while waiting on entrees.  Warmed bread was brought to the table before salads, so everyone had something to munch on.  Our entr√©es consisted from huge burger, filet, sirloin, steak tips, prime rib with lobster tail. Everyone said their meat was cook just the way they liked it.  We all talked and eat at our pace, never pushed to leave. Server continued to refresh drinks, and clear plates as we finished. We were there for 2 1/2 hours talking and catching up.  The only thing I saw was one of the table bus girls kept walking by giving us the eye. Guess she was wanting to clean our table and go home.  People at the front desk and all staff folks were friendly and pleasant, never rushing us."}
{"text":"Mal wieder ein sch√∂nes Steak gegessen und es genossen. Der Laden ist famili√§r und nicht wirklich mit den gro√üen Ketten vergleichbar. Die Qualit√§t des Essens ist sehr gut, die Bedienungen sehr umsichtig und freundlich und die Preise sind sehr human.  Ein Besuch ist wirklich zu empfehlen."}
{"text":"Sorry...but this was an awful place to eat. Went here with a coworker on a business trip. I ordered the buffalo shrimp appetizer. It arrived cold at the table and without blu cheese. I should have just ordered a steak for dinner but wanted to try some east Carolina BBQ. I could only eat 1/3 of it. The meat was greasy and oily and was not anything close to BBQ. It actually was shaped like a large patty on my plate...awful. The baked beans and coleslaw were just as bad. My buddy ordered the filet mignon and did not care for it either. He did like the nachos appetizer though. I would not go back to this place."}
{"text":"Dani was our server and is from Bulgaria and it worked! The lobster, amazing the baby back ribs fall off the bone to die for. Sweet tea made to perfection, big cut steak fries piping hot. Even the croutons were the best. You will find Maria walking around making sure everyone is happy.  Don't pass this place up!!!"}
{"text":"The food was above average in quality. The atmosphere was old family steakhouse and clean with some neat furnishings. The meal came out very slow and there wasn't really a good explanation. It was moderately expensive and the price didn't really match the overall experience."}
{"text":"When I was asked where I wanted to have my 60th birthday dinner,  it was an easy choice.  I have been to Carolina Prime numerous times and have never had a bad meal or a bad experience.  The prime rib melts in your mouth. And the daily specials are truly special.  This is one of the go-to places whenever I have out of town visitors."}
{"text":"I popped in on a Wednesday evening after 8p a couple weeks back.  I ordered the 12 oz. Carolina Ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes and a side Caesar salad.  Everything was great.  The steak was delicious!  My female server, I don't recall her name but believe she was of Eastern European descent, checked on me often.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"My son and I were in Charlotte for the weekend to go see a museum exhibit.  We ate dinner here on a Saturday night.   The parking was free and plentiful and we did not have to wait at all to get seated. We ordered a mix of steak and seafood.  The food was marginally good.  It reminded me of Red Lobster fare. They did  have some local beer on draft which was good.   The waiter did a good job of what he had to work with. It was good for a late evening dinner but probably not returning."}
{"text":"I am a fan. I enjoyed the food. I had a western omelet and salad for brunch. I enjoyed my food. The omelet was filled with fresh vegetables and covered with a heaping amount of cheese. The portions were large and flavorful. The reason for the four stars was the happy greeting as we entered the restaurant, the awesome service from our waitress who seemed to anticipate our needs and the overall attitude of everyone who worked here. I liked the food but the comfortable seating, speed of preparation of the order and the great service deserve recognition.  It is not often during busy times in the downtown area that you can find a place to rest and refuel without a hitch.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast. Tooooo much food. Are you trying to kill me. Liver mush is great. Great staff. Clean. Go there at 6am and they act like they were up all night waiting on you to arrive."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars, but had to go up because of the fabulous service. We were looking for a family friendly steakhouse and this place filled the bill. Ample parking (which we appreciated after a day spent downtown), we went on Friday night and they weren't too busy. We were seated right away.   They have a good menu selection, pretty typical of a steakhouse. We started with an order of cheese fries as our appetizer. Nothing crazy with this, just steak fries with Jack and cheddar melted on top. It was a little too overdone for my tastes, we only ate about half of it. Hubby got the Caesar as a side and I had the house salad. Both were fresh and a good size for sides. The blue cheese dressing on mine was on point. Hubby ordered the 9 oz. sirloin with garlic mashed potatoes on the side, while I had the  6 oz filet with saut√©ed spinach. His steak was cooked perfectly rare, though the mashers were dry. Luckily there was butter on the table so that helped. My steak was a little under the mid-rare that I ordered, but it was filet, so what the heck. Very tasty anyway. The spinach was nice - saut√©ed with garlic, though the garlic was a little raw tasting. I don't mind that, but some might find that off putting. The kid ordered a cheeseburger off the kids menu and it was phenomenal!  Huge and juicy, he ate it all!  With a glass of wine and a mixed drink, we got out of there for about $70. Not bad. It's a pretty place, the bar area is huge!  We'd go again if we were in that part of town. Next time I'd definitely order a burger - it was that good!"}
{"text":"A nice southern family restaurant.  It works in the area.  Not anywhere else.  Warm friendly service. Our waitress was extremely polite and helpful.  Food was ..... was ..... food.  Mess hall food served in military bases.  It was good.  No frills. Don't come here and think it's a steak house.  Choice steak doesn't fit the mold.  Ripped seats cover by duck tape and stained carpets add to the ambiance. I had the tip ends .... . My friend had the special steak and bacon wrapped shrimp. . We'll be back ..... if every other place in this town is closed."}
{"text":"Very average. Had the prime rib cooked medium rare, it was cooked perfect but the edges were a bit dry and tough. The baked potato wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese I had on it. Had to also send back the spinach and artichoke dip because It tasted horrible. The service was great though, but we won't be back due to the food."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to stumble by this place on a business trip. The food was good (not the best, but tasted like home cooking), but the prices were outstanding. If you are looking for decent food for little money, this is the place. Hard to beat to the price-point."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving one star is I can't go any lower. I ordered a medium rare New York Strip. My first bite was over done and by the time I got to the halfway mark it was raw. Add to that this looked nothing like a New York strip but more like a old piece of shoe leather.   I can eat and enjoy some not so good food but this steak would have been bad if it came off of a lunch truck yet alone a Steakhouse. First time in my life I left half a steak on my plate.  Note: The staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Food was great and fast.. Service was nice.. Good choice for CIAA WEEKEND.. I would go back.."}
{"text":"The steak was amazing, and the apps were good. For the prices I feel like this is a great deal for the food they serve."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Anything you are craving they have on the menu! And everything is so good and cooked how you like it! Have never had a bad experience or food there and the staff is super friendly. Do yourself a favor and go dine here asap!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here while in town for a Panthers game and was not disappointed.  Friendly and attentive staff and the food was quite good.  I had the ribeye which was topped with shrimp stuffed with blue cheese and wrapped in bacon. The shrimp was great and my steak was cooked just as I had ordered.  Great dinner at the expected prices for a steakhouse."}
{"text":"decent pork chops and great tea, is what I had there recently."}
{"text":"Great portions, affordable and large selection are the 3 things that come to  ind when describing Carolina Prime Steakhouse.  Although the steaks are not much to write home about, the selections and pairings are plentyful.  You will not leave this place hungry that is for sure.    Their lunch specials are the best!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on an evening weeknight to give this place a try. The server and hostess were very friendly and accommodating, stopping by frequently to see if we were enjoying our meals. My friend ordered a steak which wasn't to his liking. It was sent back and when returned, it was more along the lines of what he wanted.   I ordered the crab cakes and buffalo shrimp. I have no complaints about either, juicy plump shrimp slathered in buffalo sauce. The crab cakes were also done well and not burnt like at other establishments.  My dinner companion was not pleased with his steak and after a few more bites decided not to finish. The waitress asked if there was anything she could do, he just thanked her and declined."}
