{"text":"King of Prussia, Marilyn Monroll, and the calamari / jalapeño App were awesome!  Great spot for Saturday night date night :-)"}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh sushi! The service was so good. We were there last night for dinner. Affordable and the ambiance was modern and chic!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Visited this tasty sushi place again and they definitely have tightened up their service and have fixed all of the minor issues I witnessed with my first visit when they were just getting up and running. They still do not have a liqueur license but should have one before the end of the year making this a hot spot for the old town dining scene."}
{"text":"Having lived in Cabo for years I thought there was no way I'd find sushi that was incredible and fresh.... then I found Kaiyo.  This is by far the best Sushi in AZ and I'm going to go top 3 in my life.   If you are from CA or NY and think you have the best spots then come by and don't forget about the hot food especially the Lamb Ribs and Short ribs which I'll come back for again and again.   Decor is fresh and clean, Great cocktails wine and beer to choose from.    Now to more The Ramen Bowl, no doubt these guys make their own Ramen and aren't throwing it together overnight.  It had great flavor and consistency it's definitely the basic under flavored broth.     Must haves: King of Persia ( I did it with soy paper) Colleen's Dream Roll amazing (by the $1 per roll goes to ovarian cancer research)  Crispy Spicy Tuna  Salmon Sashimi  Tuna Sashimi"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. We came here after a very disappointing and inedible experience at Akita sushi. Excellent sushi, great gyoza, and a wonderful salad with yummy ginger dressing. I will return when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"J's new place is great! The decor is adorable and I can't get enough of the Birdgang roll."}
{"text":"We tried all of the happy hour small plates - they were all great.  Favorites were the gyoza, the avocado and all of the sushi.  Good value, good service and creative food.  Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We come here weekly. Great service, even better sushi! The boys at the sushi bar are so creative & great at what they do!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously good clean sushi coupled with fresh grooves.  Todd slices nice pieces of sashimi and creates daily phat rolls.  Check it out...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I Just returned from Tokyo and I was looking for a great sushi restaurant. Luckily for me I found Kaiyo Sushi! The sushi is amazing and the service is excellent! I highly recommend Kaiyo if you're looking for fresh quality sushi and a great dinning experience!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Very fresh - no fishy smell/taste. Quick service. Definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but when I sat down at the sushi bar all I could focus on was that the sushi chef wasn't wearing gloves, which is non acceptable handling raw fish and ready-to-eat food. I ended up ordering the crispy spicy tuna (which was delicious.) I would go back, but I hope the kitchen staff is wearing gloves next time!"}
{"text":"J and Taek never disappoint me! Hands down the beat sushi restaurant in Arizona. I still do not know how he can consistently put out such high quality dishes at such a fair price. One would never imagine fish being this fresh in Arizona, but this is the real deal. My wife and I are from the Seattle and J's is just as fresh if not better. This is a real family owned establishment that never sacrifices quality and really cares about their cliental. If you are serious about eating some real good food, stop on by and get your grub on!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal, fresh sushi, super high quality, no corners cut.  Excellent service and comprehensive menu."}
{"text":"The teenagers and I were out biking and saw that the old Arbys was up and running as our favorite food ever SUSHI!!  So the step-daughter and I came the following night. Great atmosphere inside and awesome greeter and waitress following. Pricing a lil normal to high (not great for teenagers with bottomless pits for stomachs) for sushi. Walking distance from our home major plus!"}
{"text":"Very expensive, no liquor license and slow service when the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"Terrible service. After 1.5 hours only part of our food was served. What we got was good,but it is not necessary to wait so long for Sushi. The one bowl we ordered was not served after 1.5 hours.  Rude management capped the experience. Avoid"}
{"text":"Came in for their lunch special and found out they got their liquor license! Sushi, wings, and now sake!! From the presentation to their excellent service, this place is a must see!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I went here for dinner with my friends and brother and it was great. The edamame that is spicy is super good!! I got the zen drink too that was super yummy!"}
{"text":"Yesssss! Yesss! YES! Words cannot express how thrilled I am that this place finally opened!! I came in for the opening night and was not disappointed! The head chef is AMAZING and you can tell he really knows his art! The management team and servers were all very helpful and friendly, which made for the fun/hip vibe. The atmosphere is very open and inviting and the perfect spot for dinner with a group of friends! They also have a great patio which will be perfect for those AZ summer nights!! (Just crossing my fingers they make it dog friendly )  The food is incredible! Super fresh and great quality! If you have a spicy side do yourself a favor and try the fire in the mouth roll! Health nut? The lollipop is for you! I'm also a huge fan of the chirashi bowl and the sashimi style dishes like the yellowtail carpaccio! Speaking of yellowtail... order the Hamachi Kama (aka yellowtail collarbone) it's broiled and takes a little time to cook, but it's well worth the wait!!!   Yes, the star of this place really is the sushi but they also have a ton of other non-sushi style options on the menu! Try the chicken katsu and udon noodles... both are delish!!!  Needless to say this is my new favorite sushi spot in Scottsdale!! I'm looking forward to checking out the happy hour in the near future! Yum yummmmm keep up the great work!! #getinmybelly"}
{"text":"Awesome wait staff. Super attentive. Sushi comes out very quickly and the quality is superb. Will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Great ownership, sushi is fresh and the drinks are great! Will definitely come back it's a great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for sushi in Scottsdale. Fresh, wild caught selections in a nice ambience. Ask for the chef's choice roll. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are unique and delicious. Had the spicy Korean sashimi bowl and it comes with rice. Very authentic, healthy and the right balance of protein and carb."}
{"text":"Just had our second visit to J's Kaiyo sushi bar and it was wonderful. Great atmosphere, great food, the staff is amazing. Kudos to Trevor the bartender he was really helpful. Give this spot a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!  You don't believe me?  Try it all.  So, spare ribs?  Bomb. Lamb?  Bomb. Sushi? Bomb. Pork belly? Bomb. Thighs?  Bomb. Service?  Bomb. If there is a reason to not visit.....we haven't found it.  5/5 for sure...."}
{"text":"Jay, Kaiyo's namesake, is no longer with this group -- read into this what you will about this place -- rendering an entirely different experience altogether: the quality of the fish seems to have completely changed and it's presentation on the plate has been particularly inconsistent.  It's quite incredible when such a promising new establishment so immediately alters its own trajectory.  My last two experiences generated the same response: \"WTF?\".  It's fallen off my list of Must-Haves and made my list for Stay-Away."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  J's new spot is finally open.  Same best sushi in AZ and amazing staff.  If you've ever had sushi in Hawaii you know how good it can be and J has found a way to produce the same quality and even better...in AZ.  I have never been disappointed and I always end up ordering more because it's SO good.  Try it and you won't be disappointed, they even have a full bar with liquor, will be here every week!"}
{"text":"Whoever wrote that there is a Saturday \"happy hour\" is wrong. There is also no liquor license as of 5/28. Nevertheless, the fish was fresh-but not spectacular-though the roll combos were very interesting and good. We tried three. The food is good- it isn't \"OMG !!!\" great. There is not the scope of nigiri offerings I was expecting-there are maybe 8 nigiri options at dinner. The highest priced sushi rolls were good but for $17 I'm expecting more food and higher quality fish or they need to lower prices on their most expensive rolls by about 10% This restaurant gets five star reviews. It wouldn't get 4.5 stars in a large city where there's an international airport. The sushi in Phoenix can be good. I've yet to experience \"great\" and I've been to about 4 of the highest reviewed places. I also found it odd that this place wants to sell you 5 pieces of Nigiri and 2 pieces of sushi of a particular fish. Do people really want 5 pieces of the same thing or do they want to mix and match? I like to mix and match so I found that really odd. Id think most people want orders of 2 per order-nigiri or sushi-it doesn't matter- so you can try several types of nigiri. Takeaway- if you're from NYC, LA, Chicago, Miami- you're just not going to find the highest quality flavorful raw fish in Phoenix that you're used to where there are large international airports. So, be honest with yourself and If you live here part of the year you need to decide if you're willing to settle for what passes for \"great\" sushi in Phoenix, which so far, for me is, is just pleasant or fine. If you're a Phoenix native then yes- this is close to the best- and I'd suggest that you don't eat sushi at the best places in one of the largest cities in the US on the coasts or you'll understand what I mean. It's all a point of reference."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. Patio was great for Monday night football and allows dogs!!! Sushi was very fresh and delicious! Favorites were California roll, and Tom Cruise Roll! Great wine list too, love Michael David Winery, so happy to see they had that on their list. Definitely coming back. Great staff too!!!!"}
{"text":"The worst sushi we have ever had. We were super disappointed. I tried the tuna bowl (absolutely no flavor) they didn't even have any sauces on it and I had to ask for something. That still didn't make it taste good. My friends ordered the Las Vegas roll and it had way too much eel sauce on it and the tempura part tasted like an old Rice Krispy treat..I tasted it and literally gagged and spit it out. How is this place even in business? I'm waiting on a phone call from management to discuss a refund. I had left a note on the receipt about how unhappy we were but nobody bothered to call us back last night."}
{"text":"Soooo fresh! The sushi was amazing. Newly opened so they didn't have their liquor license yet, but it should be pretty soon. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"When it opened, it was actually good.  Fresh fish.  Now we've been back quite a few times since and it just keeps going downhill.  Last time we went they were out of 80% of what we ordered so we just left.  This time, will be the last time.   Rice is wet and undercooked.  Tempura was wet and soggy.   Sushi was room temperature.   We noticed that the main sushi chef isn't there anymore...and it's noticeable.   Good service but not great food."}
{"text":"Horrible service and experience. We got sat quickly, but then were ignored as tables around us got sat and even got their orders taken. We weren't even brought water! The services and management looked directly at us multiple times and put conversations with friends at the bar and multiple other distractions above us. Super disappointing and I am questioning there professionalism and ethics which is frightening at a place that serves sushi."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite sushi place in Scottsdale! I've been a couple times with my boyfriend and every time the sushi chef makes us a perfect personalized roll with chicken (not in the menu) and I love it. Great customer service, very accommodating. A must try!"}
{"text":"Super bummed when we went in last night.  We live across the street and come to J's Kaiyo or order take-out pretty often.  Last night, the food was awesome as usual.  But the service was bad.  :(  The sushi chef was not friendly at all.  We only saw her smile one time and it was to her co-worker, never a customer.  She handed us food over the counter without a word...  Which is weird and almost rude.  Didn't say, \"Here is your Loli roll,\" (which the Loli is amazing!) or anything.  Just held it over the counter, looked the other way, and waited for us to take it.  Maybe she was having a bad day??? No need to provide bad customer service though. We sit at the sushi bar for a reason, we enjoy watching and interacting."}
{"text":"J's Kaiyo is so much prettier than Sushi J on the inside. Their sushi is one of the freshest in Scottsdale.  They are still working on perfecting their menu from what I've heard, so far the new chef is doing great.   I hope they perfect their udon noodles soon because they have so much potential!  Their hours bother me though. Because I always seem to find myself at 2 O clock hungry for sushi and have to resort to RA because they're closed. And RAs sushi is awful compared to this place."}
{"text":"Amazing how good the quality of fish/sushi is here. They're still pretty new (only been open a few months I think?) so they're still getting their alcohol permit, but since it's so new there's no problem getting in and out with really fast service! There's a handful of other sushi places in the area I can't say that for, as I can think of at least 2 other's within a few miles that have practically forgotten my wife and I were sitting there. Definitely worth checking out, they've got all the rolls you'd want, but what I thought separates them is some of the really creative appetizers!"}
{"text":"His new spot if finally open! Fresh fish every day. Subtle flavors that build on the palate. Attentive staff!  *UPDATE - liquor license, new menu, new chefs in full effect. Pork belly!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal sushi. The price point is perfect. Ask for what is off the menu for the day. The spicy wings are sautéed in Serrano peppers. The fish melts in your mouth. Our favorites are the big eye tuna sashimi and hamachi toro roll. Atmosphere is relaxing and staff are great."}
{"text":"This is Chef Jay's- from \"Sushi J\" new spot! Amazing sushi as usual but now it's served out of a beautifully renovated restaurant. They brought the whole staff from the old restaurant so service is great- very attentive and it seems like they make extra effort to get to know you. We had a couple appetizers like the garlic edamame which is new to the menu. We also had the fried rice which is the absolute best. I don't know what they do to make it so good but it is BOMB. Then we had our usual sushi rolls our favorites are the king of Persia, the heatstroke, and the fire dragon. Finish everything with some green tea mochi and that's the recipe for a perfect date night!"}
{"text":"Best family owned sushi in town! The menu has vegan options for me & I love their variety of sake/beer! I am also a fan of the friendly and efficient service"}
{"text":"Not often you see a five star on yelp. This one lived up to the hype. We ordered the Geisha Roll, Scottsdale Roll, Marilyn Roll, and Katana Roll. They all had their own unique taste and were delicious. Atmosphere was casual, bright and relaxed. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here once and it's not terrible, but I would like to weigh my options with other nearby joints before coming back. The sushi is similar to the ones that you can pick up from sprouts in the aspect that it didn't taste necessary fresh. The rice was not as soft as one would expect. The miso soup is great, the edamame is great, and the service is good as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic bento box I had chicken....was pleasantly surprised to find them whole pieces of chicken thigh which I love and they make their own sauce for it it was fantastic very generous I took half of it home for my dinner tonight. My husband had a big eyed tuna poky bowl that delicious. The rolls are very good, I highly recommend it. We will definitely be back! So next time I'm gonna try the short rib Bento box."}
{"text":"As a foodie, there's nothing else that makes me happy than discovering a great sushi place.  Went in on a Friday night and it wasn't busy. Our server was absolutely wonderful, and so was our sushi chef who ensured that we had a great dinner. For appetizers, I had a seaweed salad. It was good. I did wish that it came in a bigger serving. I also had the soft shell crab which I loved. It was cooked perfectly, and surprisingly had a lot of crab meat in it. The pork gyoza was good, nothing special but gyoza is gyoza. We had some of the salmon toro and our chef gave us a free pieces so we can pick between raw or torched salmon toro. Both tasted amazing. I had the King of Persia roll. It was okay; I thought it was very spicy. The spicy salmon roll was delicious. My boyfriend was not a fan of the sushi rice - he thought it was too cold which I agreed. We usually prefer room temperature sushi rice. Between us, we spent about $100. It was pricy but for a sushi place in old town, kind of expected. I will definitely be back when they open for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after 48 years of passing by it And it did not disappoint at all! The ambience of the place was very bold. I loved the blue painted walls and all their accent pieces and the lighting. It's such a cool spot. Food? Amazing! My friend got the Kitana rolls and you can tell by the taste that they really put so much thought in how they wanted it to taste. It has a very high quality taste to it. I ordered their Philly rolls which is made with smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado and cucumber. I loved how the flavors just came together and it just melts in your mouth. The smoky flavor of the salmon is just right, nothing too overpowering so it could give way to the avocado and cream cheese flavors of the rolls. We also tried their Spicy edamame. The spicyness was about right. Just a little sting but nothing too crazy. And for the price of just $6, the serving was plentiful. Good for at least 2-3 people. The people were amazing too! They looked all happy and friendly and the vibe is just amazing even if there weren't alot of people earlier. I won't be too surprised if this place starts popping in the next 3-6 months."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Get the salmon toro seared. Get the Persia roll and the geisha.   I'll follow J around the valley like I follow my hairdresser around. This is my spot regardless of whether I have to pass 8 sushi places to get to it.  Edited to say that they now have their liquor license!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is fantastic! The food is fresh and delicious. The staff is super friendly and they provide great service. The interior decor is beautiful and restaurant set up is open and inviting. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the appetizers they sold, but didn't care for the incessant disparagement of their rival restaurant that happens to be across parking lot. Customers may come here because they may confuse it with that very place and when they tell you 'that place is out of business' or 'they are closing'. They should instead compete on the quality of their food instead of spreading rumors. Go here and Sushi J and judge for yourself who is better."}
{"text":"A gem in old town. The restaurant is very modern and clean and the staff is friendly and attentive. The sushi was super fresh and presentation didn't disappoint. I sat at the sushi bar, but the tables look cozy and they have an outdoor area that will be great in a few weeks. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The absolute best!!!!! The new location is absolutely beautiful the service is outstanding and the food is incredible I honestly could eat here every day but once a week will do!"}
{"text":"The fish is very fresh. The service is really good, they are always making sure you have what you need and everything's just right. The sushi all together is just really good. The owner is really great takes a big roll in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in Arizona the remodel is awesome Chef Jay is still the best! Back to Thursday night sushi night!"}
{"text":"It's a sushi restaurant in a strip mall that has been many other iterations of sushi restaurants in its life, but they have happy hour til 7 on Saturday with some delicious choices."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi!  The fish is always very fresh and expertly prepared.  With rolls like King Of Persia and Heat Stroke, Kaiyo continues to innovate.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Very picky with sushi but this place is definitely worth dining in with great company! Too bad we missed happy hour.. Look forward to their happy hour next time!"}
{"text":"Really great sushi place with fresh food and helpful friendly staff!  We were really excited about this place opening and it did not disappoint. Everything is very clean and well decorated. Our waitress also helped us find the Sake we would like best and it was delicious! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Reasonable sushi happy hour so I come here with my son for date night. Fresh fish. Good service. Can't complain."}
{"text":"The colleen roll tasted very fresh!  Loved it   And yep, I will definitely be back soon  Thanks"}
{"text":"While on a Business Trip, I went to this place! The service from beginning to end was amazing! The lady serving me was awesome! Ambiance was awesome, good relaxing place! Food was good, I ordered vegetable Udon! I added Tofu on top of it which was the star of the dish.  Why one star less because the dish was bit too much sweet for my taste! Soup was sweet! Now that might be my taste and may be broader audience like this taste, so I would recommend go to this place and try there wide variety of dishes!"}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place but the service was HORRIBLE and the restaurant wasn't even crowded. The sushi was decent but we have had better. Also though it very odd that another sushi restaurant was right next door"}
{"text":"Wow what a cool spot!  The decor is so nice.  Hard to believe it was a fast food restaurant just a bit ago.    No drinks just yet, but we will be here next Friday too!!!  The rice is perfect, but they don't stuff you with it, they actually give you healthy portions of fish!!!  The staff is really cool and friendly.  We just moved from another part of town and are so glad to be back!  Downtown? Scottsdale is the best and so is J's Kaiyo!  See you every Friday!"}
{"text":"I will have to say by far this is the best sushi place i have eaten in a while. I grew up in the west coast and traveled east but to get a very fresh fish in arizona i am impressed~! The name lives up to the chefs who make art out of sushi and when they come alive its an explosion of flavors in every bite. I also like the way you can ask for a chefs special touch on all your eats and make special each meal. The atmosphere is beautiful and price is good you cant go wrong with \"j's kaiyo\" its the best place to get your fresh sushi in the north downtown scottsdale. It beats the joint across the parking lot by far must try it out."}
{"text":"So happy they finally opened up! I don't go anywhere else for sushi and had been waiting for J's new venture to open. I loved the original Sushi J and am so glad he has his great staff with him!   I was still able to get my regular favorite rolls and will be back as often as possible. The service and décor is amazing as well as the fresh delicious sushi!"}
{"text":"I'm such a fan of this neighborhood spot! The sushi is sooo fresh and always the perfect cut! My favorite thing on the entire menu is the Pork Belly Entree but to be honest there hasn't been anything that I tried that I didn't love. Chef Jason and Chef Todd paired up is something to definitely see for yourself! Why only eat from the kitchen or only from the sushi bar?!? Get the best of both worlds and have the greatest dinner  can't wait til next time! Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Sushi was fresh and unique. Best spot I've been to in scottsdale."}
{"text":"Server was very attentive, atmosphere & decor was modern & upbeat, food only so-so. Don't like when lettuce in salad is limp or has spoiled edges. Tuna chunks in Sashimi salad were small, grayish, dry, tasteless. Monster roll was big-even hubby couldn't get one piece in his mouth, consequently was too messy as it broke apart & seaweed made it hard to bite gracefully. Complimentary miso soup was indeed very nice, though."}
{"text":"I thought it odd that a sushi restaurant opened right next to another sushi restaurant. And that it renovated a former fast food joint, just like the other sushi place. But apparently, the owner from the former, Sushi J, moved and opened up another place right next door. So I guess J's Kaiyo Sushi is where the original chef came from.  The interior is so much more beautiful. Very modern and chic. They didn't have a liquor license  when we went, so hopefull that has gone through.  I ordered what I normally ordered....the Marilyn Monroll, and the other \"low carb\" rolls. All are very big yet equally delicious.  I'm sure there's more to come from this sushi chef!"}
{"text":"Quick service by Brittany and super fresh Philadelphia rolls! Not the biggest fan of the eel sauce because it isn't your typical sweet stuff like most sushi places, but they have a few great entree options (even for the sushi hater)"}
{"text":"Great customer service, but doesn't make up for the bad sushi. Our fries roll was so drenched in oil I couldn't eat it. The sea weed was chewy and one of our rolls came out minutes after we were done eating the other 3. I must say the Manager even opened up the door for us and sat us down (so nice) but I'm a foodie."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi spot in Scottsdale! The staff is always super friendly and knowledgable about all of the items on the menu. The restaurant itself is beautiful looking on the inside making for a great experience. The fish is always fresh and the garlic edamame is my favorite!!! If you like spicy tuna, definitely try the Red Dragon roll. It's delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is a great casual sushi restaurant to get some sushi in old town Scottsdale. I hate it when I go to a sushi restaurant and they slice the fish too thin or give you fish that is not his rash. This is not a problem at this place. The service is pretty good and it is not super upscale but the prices are very reasonable and the sushi is fantastic. The happy hour is awesome."}
{"text":"Great sushi and environment. Prime spot for a date night.  Try the monster roll or the soft shell crab Spider roll."}
{"text":"Went to J's new place yesterday for dinner to celebrate my daughter's birthday.     I had the Korean bowl and my daughter had the chirashi.   I didn't know what was meant by \"korean bowl\" other than the description, but I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised.   It has the sushi rice at the bottom, flavored with rice vinegar, sugar, etc.   The rice was topped with an assortment of leaf lettuce and other mixed greens, sashimi -- is that rice threads? -- seaweed, etc.  It was accompanied by a very tasty sauce that I used to dip the sashimi and lettuce.   It just needed a tiny bit since the sauce was \"strong.\"   I liked it.   I would say it is a \"light\" and healthy meal.  My daughter said her chirashi was good.   It almost looked the same as my bowl.      J's new place is very light, airy and open.  It has a sushi bar and a seating area in the front and along the side.  Very welcoming.  The server Rachel was very friendly and efficient.  There is a patio as well for those cool days.  I would go again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I live walking distance and just got around to trying this place. Sushi was ok, prices seemed kind of high for the quality. Service was mehhh. The restaurant itself is beautiful inside but I'm not their to eat the furniture. I'd rather get in my car and drive to 10 minutes to sushiholic."}
{"text":"good sushi, they don t have a liquor license yet , but excellent fish.  we had big eye tuna sashimi, salmon toro, a spicy roll and yellowtail sushi.  all were very fresh.  i will be back as soon as they have sake."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our first time here!! Staff and even the executive chefs are a part of the customer service here. Tiffany was amazing, and chef Jason's food was perfect! This ramen bowl was everything we could have wanted out of ramen! We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet, you have to stop by.   I love it so much I went twice in one week!  First of all, the happy hour prices are great. My first time in I ordered 2 spicy salmon hand rolls and a 2pc yellowtail nigiri for myself, and it was only $11 on happy hour before tip. I went in a second time with my boyfriend and we ordered 5 hand rolls, 4pc nigiri (salmon and yellowtail), and a mixed seafood poke bowl, all for about $35(?).   The fish is fresh and delicious. The first time I had the spicy salmon hand rolls, the fish was cut in larger chunks and absolutely melted in your mouth. I like that consistency a lot more than the super-chopped spicy salmon mix that most sushi restaurants serve.   We also really liked the ambiance. The servers were so friendly and Mallory - the sushi chef - was very kind and answered all of our questions.   I can't wait to come back and explore the rest of the menu! I have my eye on a certain specialty roll...  Edited to mention that the prices above are before tip."}
{"text":"This place has never got off the ground. It sad because every time I have come here in the past the service at least has been pretty good. But now even that has gone down hill. All the waitresses are to busy socializing to even seat the few customers they have. Such a shame, this place could have been a unique spot. The second shoe chefs are also terrible. All the rolls look like my 4 yo made them!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi spot in old town.  Fish is always fresh, love all the speciality rolls and the new atmosphere is amazing!"}
{"text":"With all the great press, we came with high expectations. Love the decor, staff was friendly enough, but the food was well...  - Cucumber salad- was beautiful, but awkward to eat with large, irregularly shaped chunks. The miso dressing was tasty when you got some, but overall the dish tasted flat. Maybe cut the cukes smaller and marinate a bit longer? - Edamame- good size bowl, nice and steamy, but a bit too much salt even more me (and that's saying somethin') - Avocado stuffed with crab- this seems to be the darling of food critics, but I just didn't dig it. Lovely presentation, but the crab in the middle tasted more like tuna. I avoided the mango (allergy), but B said it was too sweet; better with a dip in soy. - Loli roll- sans rice and nori was fresh tasty, but ours didn't look like the lollipops I saw on earlier Yelp pics.  - King of Persia- this was the best of the three we tried, loved the tempura green onion - Citrus salmon- had potential, but it had a fishy taste that is never good when eating sushi  - Octopus- this was amazing!! One of the best octo-dishes I've ever had. Perfectly cooked, served over a yummy squash puree. If everything we ordered tasted this good, I'd be 5 star-ing.   Would return for the octopus, and to try a few more of their small plates and salad, but not a sushi destination."}
{"text":"It was my first visit as I am from out of town but travel here frequently. I ordered two rolls and they were both prepared perfectly.  The service was spot on and the taste of the food did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. Good prices. We were handled with care and love by the manager and our server Cynthia. Thank you"}
{"text":"The sushi is delicious, but the atmosphere is amazing! This place has like a super chill, kinda sexy SoCal vibe and I am LOVING it! Will be back many times!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi quality. I am very happy with the freshness of the fish. Also amazing service by Mallory. 10/10 on service,atmosphere and sushi quality."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the evening at J's Kaiyo last night.  The setting is cool and the service was friendly and good. It wasn't busy but sometimes that means lackluster service and that wasn't the case.  We enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar and had fun meeting some of the other customers which was encouraged by the staff.  The food was tasty. Fish fresh. There was a little something missing in the signature roll selection that we ordered though. They were abundant with variety, but didn't seem to create a cohesive taste.  I am a long time sushi lover and I order different items every where I go to try them out. I wasn't a total fan here, but I'd be willing to come back and try some other options and see if I can hit it better."}
{"text":"Great and tasty low carb sushi options! Ordered the Marilyn Monroe, King of Prussia, salmon sashimi and the calamari and everything was delicious! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I was really skeptical about going to  a somewhat pricey restaurant in what used to be an Arby's, but it's hands-down one of my best finds. Beautiful decor and all of their sushi is so good. My favorite items are the Calypso roll, spicy edamame, and the crab & avocado. The best thing I love about this place is being able to come here with people who don't love sushi because they have some incredible non-sushi dishes on their menu, like beef short ribs and pork belly. Their cocktails are also fantastic and I love having a couple Zen Gardens to go with my Calypso roll."}
{"text":"Really great sushi and love the atmosphere. Decorated much nicer then most sushi places you find. My only complaint is that they are closed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Best fish in AZ. Todd turns out phenominal dish after dish. The people and service are great! No need to go anywhere else! Chef Jason on the grill in the back will undoubtedly impress!"}
{"text":"Moving from Chicago a few years ago we had a difficult time finding good sushi places in the area (we've easily tried 12-15 different places with only 2 of them being worth going back to). We hit the Jackpot when we found J's Kaiyo!  We've been probably a dozen times now.... And never left unsatisfied with the food.  The decor is really unusual for most sushi places. It's actually BRIGHT and colorful... most other places seem so dark. They also have a spacious patio area when the weather permits.   We've sat at the sushi bar almost every time and really enjoy interacting with the sushi chefs. Shout out to Freddie and Todd!! They're both super helpful and have taught us a lot about sushi in general.   The non-sushi menu is super good for those who don't eat sushi. Some of our favorites are the shishito peppers, spicy wings, seaweed salad, and short ribs. The drink menu is decent as well, has a little bit of everything although we usually don't stray away from saki-bombs and wine.   Onto the really good stuff now..... SUSHI   All the fish is always extremely fresh/tasty and they take a ton of pride getting stuff flown in ALL the time. Some of our go-to items include: Big eye tuna sashimi/nigiri, salmon toro nigiri, Tom Cruise roll, Kaiyo roll, and anything Todd suggests.   Bottom line... it's a wonderful establishment with some of the best sushi we've found in the area. It's a must try if you haven't been"}
{"text":"Really excellent food, staff is professional and attentive. Been here twice and definitely will go back. Awesome happy hour!"}
{"text":"Have to go with 5 stars considering this sushi joint offers the freshest cuts and super service!  The new location is bright and convenient. Portions are generous and did I mention how fresh the sushi is?  Joe and I found our AZ sushi spot!"}
{"text":"New place in old town. Pretty picky about sushi, and this place was amazing!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday and it was amazing! Sushi was amazing and the fish was so fresh!! Loved the vibe, the service, the prices and the food.. will be my go to sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Walking in, the vibe and ambiance of the restuarant with plenty of open space and soft colors of ocean blues create the vibe of an oceanic sushi oasis with a delicious menu choices super fresh and flavorful to the palette. J is amazing! He continues to get great quality fish and ingredients! My fav? Always the yellowtail and unique rolls named Dynamite.. Marilyn Monroll... I could go on and on with the coolness and creativeness of this place but you need to just try it for yourself! Best new little sushi gem in Scottsdale is now my ONLY sushi joint in town!"}
{"text":"After searching far and wide we have finally found our new favorite sushi spot in valley!! This place is amazing, everything we ordered was perfectly executed and delicious! We celebrated my Husbands Birthday with these fine folks last Saturday and they took such incredible care of our party. Thanks again, we shall be visiting you again soon!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and sat at the sushi bar with my girlfriend this evening. Waitress walked passed us a few times, didn't acknowledge us once. The dudes behind the sushi bar were watching the baseball game with his back turned the whole time. Waited for 10-15 min and walked out.  Do yourself a favor and walk over to Sushi J. Or just say F it and go to Nobu"}
{"text":"Another great experience. The fish they have is SO fresh. Atmosphere is very good -- nothing loud. People great.  As in previous reviews our go to place for Japanese in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Totally amazing! I was hesitant as I am more into traditional sushi places..sushiko and sushi sen, both also exceptional, but J's Kaiyo take this experience to a different level without compromising the quality and freshness of the sushi.I was so enthralled that I ordered the lamb ribs to go for dinner later on. Even after reheating they were OMG exceptional! This is definitely a place although I find a tad pricey I will most definitely frequent again and again."}
{"text":"First time here, came for happy hour, fantastic food and value! Great staff and service, sushi was very fresh an YUM. Next time need to try the ribs"}
{"text":"We went here the first night in town, and were so glad we did! Service was incredible. We had a darling girl at the front with glasses (wish I remembered her name) seat us and suggest a sake option. She insisted on pouring for us as it's bad luck to do it yourself. We were down to get some good luck!   Rolls were delicious! We had a few specialty rolls and one veggie roll that was not on the menu, but chef made just for us. By far the most delicious veggie roll I have ever had.   Overall amazing food, great service, warm and welcoming staff and a cute place."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. We will definitely be coming back here. The sushi chef is great and really knows every ingredient on the menu. I have a gluten allergy and they did an awesome job accommodating me. I highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"The sushi was good although it's not the best I've had. The waitress and the stuff were very friendly and helpful when we asked about specifics on the menu. It has relatively good pricing as well."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Used to be Arby's now all fancy and yummy. Brought my Asian cohort who states food is not authentic but still very good, just more of a fusion. I liked everything. Services was pretty good, and there's alcohol just in case that matters."}
{"text":"If mediocrity was the goal, this is a five-star hit. I know there were some bumps in the road in getting this venture off the ground. With the delays, I would have expected them to have more time to reach for the stars. Unfortunately, that doesn't appear to have been the case.  When we arrived, the music was so loud, we couldn't sit in the main section of the restaurant. The servers were friendly enough, but I didn't come looking for companionship; I came in hopes of being wowed with professionalism. They fell short. Training is sorely lacking. The food showed flashes of creativity and potential, but it generally fell short of the level I had expected. It was mediocre at best.  There's still time to move it up the ladder, but there's work to be done. For me, I'll be waiting until someone tells me they've upped their game."}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful setting, quick service. Edson was an amazing waiter! Very attentive and kind. Definitely will come back :)"}
{"text":"Overview: first and last time.   Food: we came during happy hour. Reasonable prices. The sushi on happy hour menu is comparable to prepackaged sushi. Sushi rice isn't soft. More hard texture like slightly uncooked rice. Happy hour quality I guess. I love toro tuna so we ordered the hand rolls-specialty menu. Sushi chef served us the happy hour sushi, them stopped to watch tv behind him. He forgot the hand rolls. He then asked if we wanted to order anymore sushi so we had to remind him we were still waiting for the remaining order. The result was also disappointing. The tuna they provided was not toro. It was not fatty, melt in your mouth, tuna. It was like ahi, raw tuna. I do not recommend it.   Service: so they provided a menu, when we got the bill, it was higher. Apparently we somehow got last year's happy hour pricing, informed them kindly. They apologize and took it off but said just \"letting you know that's not the right price\". Well, that was provided, it wasn't our fault as the customer that they provided the wrong menu. Overall service was so so.   Environment: newer look. Newer restaurant.   Parking: private and spacious.   Overall.. it's cheap low quality sushi. I recommend going up a little north to Hiro where you get high quality service AND quality food."}
{"text":"I like this place because they make some innovative rolls that are really interesting  along with the standard rolls that you expect. I have tried the \"low carb\" wrapped in either rice paper or cucumber and they are delicious. Staff friendly and unobtrusive."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new sushi spot and came upon this place.  The sushi was fresh and authentic.  The King of Persia roll was one of the best rolls I've had.  I will have to come back to try some more rolls and sashimi.  Service was pretty decent for a place that had been opened for only a few weeks."}
{"text":"Amazing miso, edaname and keto friendly sushi.  Eating low carb can be a challenge when eating out but I had so many options and can't wait to go back.  Service was superb."}
{"text":"Can't believe this used to be an Arby's it's sleek modern design is inviting and relaxing. We went for lunch and both the sushi and sashimi specials were excellent. Nice selection of fish that started with miso soup and a salad. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good but not great.  The fish was warm not chilled. The rice was crisp lacking a proper stick togetherness.  The flavors were decent snd the staff friendly.  I'd give it an ok not great."}
{"text":"I checked out J's Kaiyo sushi recently on a Friday evening with a few friends. Our experience overall was a bit disappointing to say the least. Mind you, we drove about 20 miles to dine here specifically as we were all in a sushi mood that night & this place was highly rated. The restaurant is nicely decorated and has a cool vibe yet on a Friday night around 7ish it wasn't really busy (maybe 4 tables besides us?). We placed our order for a few appetizers and about 15 min later it still wasn't on the table. We had ordered the Shishito peppers and garlic edamame. I asked our server and he went to check with the kitchen then came back and said \"just a few more minutes\". OK, np we were starving but patient. 10 minutes later we still didn't have our appetizers but they did eventually come out (once we received our entrees). This was not OK but we didn't say anything to our server as I said, we were really hungry. The food looked amazing but the shishito peppers were exceptionally salty, the garlic edamame was just eh because the garlic got burned (you know when you can taste that burnt garlic flavor). The Vegetable Udon was very spicy, too spicy for a few of us at the table. My roll (can't remember the name) was pretty good but my veggie roll was just ok, very small. Our server wasn't as attentive as I expected, waiting around for water after eating spicy food is not ok. I get it, especially on a busy weekend but if it's not that busy I feel attentiveness is important. Overall, for the price I don't feel we received a good value for the experience. Will we be back? Not likely. Too many other sushi restaurants to try closer to home."}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Service is on point, food is amazing and like the atmosphere. The sashimi especially was really fresh and tasty. Finally a reasonable priced sushi restaurant in scottsdale that does it well."}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant but food is marginal. Rolls are loosely wrapped and fall apart. Plated nice but the rolls themselves look sloppy. Tempura shrimp was not the best. Some bites had an unusual fishy taste. Green tea was not even warm let alone hot.  Squid salad was really good and a generous portion. No liquor license yet. Probably would not go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The fish quality is amazing and they have their liquor license now! Service is also fantastic. What I love the most is that it's a sushi place where you can get awesome speciality rolls or nigiri/sashimi and not be disappointed. The decor is also really nice and they have a TV at the sushi bar. Hands down my favorite sushi place in the area!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass sushi! Awesome service specifically the tall server with the beard. He was very helpful and attentive. Good location in scottsdale. Not too far from 202."}
{"text":"OMG GREAT SUSHI.....in AZ...FINALLY!!! Had dinner at the bar with my gf last weekend and I literally stuffed my face and couldn't stop eating even though I was SO full. (You know how that is with sushi) Of course we over ordered and ate it all! Thank you Chef Todd for making us our amazing meal and impeccable service!   Super fresh fish and great selection of special rolls that aren't trendy and lame. Definitely more of an old school meets modern version of sushi at an affordable price for what you get.   The restaurant is crazy CUTE! I do not know how they converted this place from an Arby's to what it's transformed to now. It's tucked away in the Sprouts center near Zipp's off of Camelback and Miller Rd. So a nice quieter departure from the Old Town scene.   Go here now! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Delicious sashimi, toro, sea bream, tuna, salmon, octopus, yellowtail. Pricing is around 80-100 for two people (that's a sashimi platter, eel, cucumber salad, edamame, one roll, and tea to drink) We'll be back!"}
{"text":"O..........M........G BECKY!! Best sushi in Phoenix! We were here visiting and found this place. The decor is absolutely beautiful. The house salad is amazing the dressing is the best I've ever had (and I've been to plenty of sushi places). We got the lunch special and the teriyaki beef special and it was delicious. The sushi rolls were so good, including the California roll (no stick crab here, thank you!) So fresh and delicious. My son is Vegan and they went out of their way to accommodate him with the veggie roll and veggie fried rice, he loved it! I wish this place was in ALBUQUERQUE. BEST SUSHI PLACE IN PHOENIX. You won't be disappointed! Great customer service....enjoyed talking to the owner, he's great! All around great experience and delicious food"}
{"text":"I always hate to leave a bad review unless it was a really bad experience.  So with this place I will say this... the location is great, the way that they remodeled the place is spot on (not too trendy but not cheap looking), the staff was very friendly, but the food just didn't do it for me.  With what my guest and I had, the tastes were either too bland, too over powering, or just not quite right.  Don't know if it is because I grew up around traditional Japanese food or that I have become too accustomed to scottsdale Asian cuisine, this place just didn't do it for me.  The Kirin Light was good though :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town without a doubt!  The fish is very fresh and good. This place is locally owned and operated by Jay who you will usually see behind the sushi bar, super nice guy. You must try this place if you are reading this review. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Delicious sushi, awesome service, and close to home.  Cannot beat it!!"}
{"text":"Amazing meal, my new favorite sushi bar in Scottsdale/Phoenix area! Everything we ordered  was fresh and delicious. The service was beyond great. I absolutely recommend checking it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fresh fish, friendly staff and they have alcohol now!  J's Kaiyo Sushi & Bar has my favorite sushi in the Scottsdale area so far. The fish was incredibly fresh, cut well, and served at the perfect temperature so that you could really taste the tuna and the salmon. The rice was properly done - none of that overly sweet Americanized nonsense you get at some places. They had a happy hour (until 6:30pm) so I tried an excellently executed salmon and avocado roll, as well as the pork gyoza. I was surprised the gyoza were deep fried but it actually went really with the yuzu miso sauce, which I could have easily poured over a bowl of rice and guzzled up. My banana whiskey cocktail was just the right amount of sweetness to go well with the gyoza too. I also tried the fresh uni nigiri (SO GOOD) and the King of Persia roll which was very nice with the garlic ponzu and fried green onion. Overall, just everything was good and the miso sauce made me want to try more of the kitchen menu as well as the sushi. Definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is officially my new neighborhood favorite! They have a pretty decent Happy Hour, they have a kids menu, and the service was good. We were VERY happy with the sushi, and they also had some really interesting non-sushi items on happy hour. They also have rotating roll specials! The decor is awesome, and I am so excited to continue patronizing this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi bar. Really interesting and different rolls on their sushi list.  Can't wait to go back when they are approved for beer and wine."}
{"text":"For the value during happy hour, I give this place five stars. We had the edamame, seaweed salad, yellowtail nigiri, salmon nigiri, and crab avocado from the happy hour menu. All were great quality and I was especially impressed by the generously sized cuts of fresh fish.   We also had the chicken thighs off the regular menu and give them a big thumbs up.   Service was quick and friendly. It wasn't busy when we first arrived, but was starting to pick up as it got later.   They have a small outdoor patio for nice nights.   Happy hour is currently 430-630pm."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new sushi place tonight and so we gave this place a try. Suffice to say they have a LONG way to go to meet four or five stars. The server, while polite, was terrible. He forgot to put in our sushi roll orders and when we asked about them half an hour later, he kinda laughed and was like \"oops I knew I forgot something.\" The manager did come over to apologize but his table side manner was more tweeker than professional...constantly messing with his clothes, chewing on his tongue, no eye contact. He said that he would comp half of the food and rush our dinner. The rolls arrive but we're somewhat lackluster. When we had to ask the server for the check rather than having it delivered...less than 20% was comped. Had the manager said he was only going to comp 20% that would have been fine, however, he said that he would comp half and after spending 10 years in the restaurant industry myself, it's the principle of the matter. The issue was resolved eventually but over all the experience left a lot to be desired. Pity since we'd heard good things about the place and had high hopes."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's favorite place to eat. It's great quality sushi with a great atmosphere and an even better price. If you go dressed up or dressed down, it really doesn't matter because you'll fit in. My only complaint is that there is one waitress who is a little rude so we just avoid her. There's another waitress who is SUPER nice and extremely helpful! She's always been so inviting. Go eat here!"}
{"text":"We read that Sushi J's Chef had moved to this new Place. Gave it a try, First there is no Beer , the Las Vegas Roll was awful. It taste like New B's made the sushi. Not the great taste from the original Sushi J'S we had tasted."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi...fresh, inventive and combinations that worked! The vibe was laid back located in a repurposed fast food restaurant, don't let this stop you as you will deny yourself some of the best sushi in town. The entire wait staff was great. Super nice people that wanted to be there and gave great recommendations on J's sushi of choice. The presentation was great and portion of the sushi was more than generous! Looking forward to being back!"}
{"text":"My partner and I are vegan and we came here to check it out, as generally we can find good vegan options at Sushi places.  The staff was a little confused about what is vegan and what is not, and there was a lot of checking with the chefs, which resulted in actually less options than we usually have at other places.  That being said, there were some nice vegan options and we enjoyed what we had."}
{"text":"Excellent new sushi slot in Snotsdale. This sushi place is a nice little secret and not located in the center of the hustle of Old town Scottsdale, but is easily accessible due to its proximity to it. Wonderful service and candor with Rachel who is A+++ as our server last night, and made my visiting friend feel like he was eating grade A sushi in SF! We were not terribly disappointed for the lack of the liquor license as OHSO and other fine drinking establishments are not too far away."}
