{"text":"I absolutely love this bar. Especially for their burgers . Those suckers are huge and oh so filling. The workers here are Sweet and very homey people and I never had a bad time with any of them. They also have awesome mini events, delicious affordable food, and a hot selection of music! My man and I have been coming here for yearrrrs and it stills delivers every single time. I recommend this place to all my friends and I think would be a great spot as your first bar as well. Good vibes and all, love you guys!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town, not to expensive and have good selection of craft beers. You get two burgers n fries for under 15 bucks add craft beer and you get it all for around 20 bucks. You can smoke here too."}
{"text":"We 3 sat for a few minutes at lunch time without being greeted. We 3 sat for few more. Still nothing. We 3 like to smoke and drink especially after smoking and drinking the night before :) We 3 left :( 
You can trust me I'm in the business."}
{"text":"I came here the other night with a friend and her parents after a late dinner. Her dad claims to be \"the original Dirty Harry\". We had a blast and the drinks and atmosphere were very Pittsburgh. Patrons are allowed to smoke inside, it did not bother me but it bothered some of the people in our party."}
{"text":"On an unsually cold May night which Penguins happened to play , during my very first visit to Pittsburgh while I was walking toward my hotel I walked by this place , it's hard to miss it because of big bright signs they have got outside .
1st thing caught my attention was people smoking inside ! If you want to know more about smoking law in pittsburg you can check out :

It's an old but very cool local. I sat at the bar and ordered a beer from tap ,beer showed up and it was cold enough! That is why I am giving them 4 stars .
I had a burger , it was great . My waitress was very friendly and good at her job .
If you happen to stay in station square arwa you should check this place out ."}
{"text":"What's to like but also what's to hate? I also have a theory this place doesn't really exist and anyone you see in there is a ghost. It reminds me of the bar in Flashdance except without fun or dancing. 4 stars for being haunted and cheap and weird."}
