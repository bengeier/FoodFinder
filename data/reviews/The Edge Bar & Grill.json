{"text":"Great wings and good prices. The bartender was very attentive and I felt at home despite being from the states. 

Went on a Sunday night and I found myself in the midst of a bunch of late 50 year olds / 60 year olds. Wasn't a young crowd but I didn't mind as they had football on, live band, and great food."}
{"text":"Excellent place in Ajax to come out and hang with friends, shoot a game of pool, eat, listen to great tunes or burn some calories on the dance floor."}
{"text":"It was a friend's birthday party and she wanted to dance. Edge had a cover band playing on that Friday and they were good. The variety of music played attracted all ages, which was nice. 

Bathroom only had 2 stalls, which is insane for a night club. There was a line up all night. Beer selection was not great and my friend was sad that they stopped carrying the coolers she liked. 

There were pool tables at the back and a large dance floor that was packed. Free parking is always a bonus.

Cover was $5 after 9:30pm."}
