{"text":"My wife has been going to Garcia's for 40 years! She asked me to join her there after we met about 15 years ago.  I did and she ordered the Cheese Enchiladas.  I said Chicken would be better.  Of course I tasted hers...and for 15 years I have ALWAYS ordered the fabulous cheese enchiladas!  The Margaritas are GREAT and the chips and salsa (try the hot mixed with the mild) are hard to beat.  Five Stars for me. We go there whenever we're in the neighborhood.

Sun City folks"}
{"text":"Fast service and literally portions so big you shouldn't be allowed to eat it. I've been there 5 or 6 times and have had something different each time and it's always pretty good. Awesome, amazing, 5 star salsa. I wish that was my meal."}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in the valley!
We always ask for Omar to serve us. Great service!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 25 years making this one of our first stops for Mexican food in the Valley. Chips and salsa are supreme. Light and crispy. Salsa is fresh and flavorful. Spinach queso like no other. Had my usual #2, red enchilada, shredded beef taco and tostada.. Way more food than most people can  consume. Had to have shredded beef taco first, the best anywhere.  Red ench next and easily done but no room for tostada. Although the food was very good it wasn't as good as I've had. Always five stars but this trip was 4****. Still definitely worth a stop for authentic Mexican flavors."}
{"text":"Had a great super quick lunch in the main restaurant! Service was great everyone really friendly and food order was out to the table so fast I was amazed. My cheese enchilada was excellent. The decor is dated just like I remember when I was a kid but that's what makes it the Original. Its a keeper."}
{"text":"Nasty disgusting food , whitewash Mexican yes real thing no way 
Salsa sucked , order enchilada style burrito bus was nasty."}
{"text":"If anyone remembers the original Garcia's that was South of McDowell next to the Ace Hardware,  and Southwest Supermarkets, will agree.  The food was much better then.  They maintained those standards in the new restaurant up until Julio died.  After that,  steadily it's been on the decline.  It's good by today's standards but,  nothing like it use to be"}
{"text":"This review is for the drive thru part of the restaurant. The window girl was so nice and she was fun to talk to. I love nice people and I'm always so impressed by it in customer service because unfortunately it seems it's few and far between nowadays. More people should love their jobs and enjoy their customers it makes for a better day for everyone. I know because I have worked worth the public for 20 plus years. Anyways sorry for the rant, lol. She was awesome and made me want to come back. The food was good all we got was chips and fried ice cream but both were yummy as usual. The fried ice cream could have used a tad more honey but still good. Love this place and love that I live close and can get drive thru good that isn't fast food. Plus the prices are a tad lower than the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience... Found a chicken bone in my burrito, food took 45 minutes to come out, never saw our server, and it wasn't busy at all. There was no excuse for the terrible service and wait times, let alone the bone that I almost broke a tooth on. 

The atmosphere is kind of cool, but they could care less about you and it shows. We finally asked to speak with the manager (I have never done that before in my life), and she quasi apologized and informed us that she would discount our bill- When the bill arrived she deducted a whopping $4! That was less than the burrito cost with the chicken bone. This place must be kind of good because of all the positive reviews, but I would NEVER recommend going to this place."}
{"text":"Really solid lunch deals and pretty close to Tex-Mex which I still get cravings for from time to time. I had the spinach chicken enchiladas and they were nice. It was a ton of food (of course) so we definitely needed boxes for leftovers. If you're in the neighborhood, it's a solid deal and I'd stop in again. My only wish is that they did a green sauce with the spinach chicken enchiladas. That would be heaven."}
{"text":"A great place for mexican food. First clue is you actually see mexican people eating there and not just in the kitchen working. We love getting the Jimmy fries as an appetizer, I highly recommend them! I usually order the carne asada taco plate. Super delicious, but you have to ask for limes on the side as they don't come with. They serve them with rice, beans and guacamole. All are awesome but the rice. I'm not a big fan of it, there lies their inconsistency. It's under flavored or not cooked all the way through most times. The service varies depending on the waiter. There's a waiter there who can ruin your dining experience with his rudeness and lack of urgency when you request anything. If you get Miguel what an amazing individual on the ball through your entire exprience. Also, if you ever have a party or function where you must bring food I definitely recommend ordering the Botana Platter. They usually only need about 1 hour to make it. It has small portions of their shredded beef tacos, chimichangas, rolled tacos, a bowl of beans in the middle and a huge bag with chips and salsa. So BOMB! Get the hot salsa and mix it with the regular sooooooo freaking good.  They also have banquet rooms if you have a big group."}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago. The service was not good, the food was not good and the salsa had so much salt you could not taste anything but salt. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'm sure the food would be better if they had more professional employees. I used to be a regular, now I hardly step in. The best times were when Mike and Sherman ran the bar. Mike is one of the most professional, upbeat, positive employees that ever worked there. Recently things changed and the old miserable bartenders were back in place of Mike. I'm sorry but Ofelia is a bitter old miserable person and she is extremely rude and she is slow. Omar has no personality and is boring. Now I've been coming here a long time on a regular basis but over the last couple of months this place has deteriorated, the quality of the food is not what it used to be and more over just the public display of unprofessionalism of the staff. I witnessed two female employees argue and call each other a b*tch in the dining area. The employees openly talk bad about each other in front of customers. I was in the bar once and Ofelia referred to Sherman in a derogatory racial slur as he walked away from the bar area. I've never witnessed such unethical business practices in a dining establishment.  The majority of your staff is extremely unprofessional. Your restaurant wouldn't survive a day in the real corporate world with the level of unethical behavior that occurs there. I stopped by today and I asked to sit on my regular section with Mike, I was told by your hostess that Mike no longer worked there that he was fired. Not only should that information be confidential from a human resources perspective but the smile on your hostess face sealed my decision to not come to your establishment again. I turned around and left. I have hosted numerous business functions there and now I will be hosting them at other places. I think your staff needs a complete overhaul starting with your management. A business is only as good as the management hired to run it and I'm sorry to say you suck at it."}
{"text":"Awesome food! They ain't stingy with the food serving eaither! You won't regret eating here unless you don't like Mexican food"}
{"text":"The salsa was fresh and quite good. We came on a Sunday night and it was packed! We decided to try another Mexican restaurant after trying Rita's. We went to Rita's because it was not a chain. After reading the reviews, we decided to try Garcia's. We decided to sit in the bar area to avoid the wait. As large as the bar area was, I was surprised to find one bartender taking care of everyone. The restaurant is pretty big so I would think that they'd be used to having a full house, considering there aren't many other choices in the area! All we kept  hearing was how busy they were from the employees! I have to say the drinks were pretty stiff (thus the 2 star rating)! I should have known not to order any appetizers because I was afraid they would be served with the entrees. Well I was right! Needless to say I wasn't hungry anymore after two baskets of chips and salsa! I ordered the burro ranchero, expecting pork since it was served with verde sauce. The meat was beef, and it was chewy and tough (damn, two nights in a row)! We also had the mini appetizer platter with taquitos, tacos, and chimis...all beef. My friend doesn't eat beef so that was a waste. The menu didn't specify what kind of \"minis\" they were. He also had spinach enchilada platter with chicken. He compared it to cream of spinach soup. I took a to go box only to end up dumping the food when I got back to my hotel. Another disappointing Mexican food experience in Phoenix! The drinks were bomb! Couldn't even finish my margarita azul!"}
{"text":"Love coming here with family! It just classical Mexican food with pretty good service. Never busy Sunday morning"}
{"text":"We drive out of our way from east Phoenix to come to this Garcia's. It's been family tradition for so many years. It's the original and the best!"}
{"text":"I visited this location as it has been a tradition in my family for years now, our waiter was noticeably new and ONLY was available to take our order and hand us the check. Needless to say the waiter handed me the bill , charged my card for the table across from ours bill. Again, he was no where to be found, I asked the nice \"bus lady\" to speak to the manager. When the manager came out he went to the wrong table and was just as helpful as our waiter. He then found our table, and said he'd void the transaction and charge me for my bill. Ok Great! So I check my bank account to make sure there isn't any crazy stuff going on, which there was! My card was charged for DOUBLE the amount my bill was and not the receipt our crappy waiter brought to us. Zach the manager gave us our meal on the house, told me I should expect a refund in 3-5 days, didn't give me a receipt authenticating the voided transaction but assured me it was done. By this time I was fed up, annoyed and ready to leave. Here I am a week later contacting the DM \"Diana\" who has no knowledge of my transaction because I have no receipt , Zach threw away the voided receipts. I gave Diana the last 4 digits of my card so that she could look it up and give me a call in the next 30mins. No call, I called a day later and asked for an update, when Diana decides that I'm lying and I need to show her a bank statement because there are no transactions with my card number or for the amount I was charged. So I sent her my bank statements about 20 minutes ago, no confirmation it was received. Out of 10 years I have had no issues, mistakes happen I understand. That is why managers are there to assist customers instead of calling them liars and requesting personal information, Zach and Diana - Get your act together!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years & I absolutely love it!!! They have such good food & awesome service. It's very down to earth & they're friendly! I would recommend them to everyone. My job actually has their Christmas party their every year, it's so good. :)"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the the famed \"Original Garcia's\"... perhaps my hopes were too high. I walked in and felt comfortable. The decor was just beautiful, and the service was absolutely wonderful. Each attentive employee that I interacted with made me feel like a guest.
Things however took a terrible turn when I received my food. I ordered one of my favorites, Red Menudo with flour tortillas. The tortillas were not fresh, they tasted like the thick grocery store shelved tortillas that I try to avoid. The menudo meat was disappointing as well. It had not been cut well, and my bowl had a couple of VERY large chucks of fatty meat. 
Sadly, the food did not live up to all that I had heard..."}
{"text":"I've have been coming here since '98 and I must say that it is one of my faves. (not to be confused with the other locations) For the longest time I ALWAYS have gotten the chicken chimichangas and the enchilada sauce they top it with is on point! I have also tried the taco steak which is really good as well as the green chili-both entrées come with your choice of corn or flour tortillas. The salsa and chips are usually pretty good too and you can easily get carried away and get full just from that while waiting for your food. I never have had to wait too long between first walking in to the restaurant and getting my meal, they usually provide pretty prompt service."}
{"text":"We used to come to this place very often. Now we leave fur a way and only visiting ones a month. Great service and nice people"}
{"text":"To start it has one star because I have to give them at least one star....

So I never ever do this but yesterday I decided to give a \"Mexican\" restaurant a chance being 5 de Mayo and taco Tuesday I gave in.  My lovely friend and I go to Garcias Las Avenidas on 35th Ave and Encanto. The venue it's self is beautiful. The old Mexican hacienda theme took me by surprise. We waited about 45 min after being told it was only going to be 20 min. After being seated, I had to walk back to the bar because u can't have drink specials through the server you had to get them your self. 

I ordered fajitas and my friend ordered enchiladas. Some of the worst \"\"Mexican\"\" food I have ever had. The cheese was gross, the crema was warm, the fajitas wer swimming in oil. The service was pathetic! None of the servers or bar tender wanted to be there. They close at 9 and don't inform you about that when you sit down at 845!!! The only good thing is the chips there! I was very upset and this is why \"Mexican\" food restaurants in my mind are the worst to go to. No one offers reeeeeal Mexican food unless it's a lonchera or a lil whole in the wall Siri can never find! Garcias is a gross display of Chicano & Tex-Mex food! The service, the food, and the over all experience suuuucked!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 'sampler' (chili relleno, taco, and enchilada) in order to see how they prepare the Mexican food.  All the dishes were good.  However, I thought that all the dishes lacked a spicy flavor - which frankly - is a major part of Mexican food.  Those in our group had the same feeling with their meals. 
Loved the atmosphere and the decorations on the walls.  Service was amazing.  A courteous team were very attentive to our requests.
Great place for parties over 6 people.
Lastly, we thought that price for our meals were very reasonable - and frankly surprised at the value."}
{"text":"The wife and I come at least once a month. Best home style Mexican food in the valley. Taste like someone's grand mother in in the kitchen"}
{"text":"Love the chimis. Always take out of town guests here. Only down side is slow service during dinner but its worth it."}
{"text":"Beautiful authentic Mexican restaurant with decent food, moderate prices and good service.

Chips and Salsa (5/5): Complimentary but most importantly one of the best Salsa I have ever tasted.  

Guacamole appetizer (3/5): Decent portion but it's pretty much avocado mashed up. Basically bland taste.  Couldn't taste lime or salt or jalapeño, definitely no tomatoes or cilantro. 

Fajita (4/5): sizzling and tasty and a good size portion. What disappointed me was the lack of beef strips. Instead there was just a lot of onions. But I would definitely recommend it since the portion when put together does make a delicious Fajita. 

Pollo Fundido (4/5): highly recommended on Yelp. Yet it failed to impress me.  That being said it is a filling dish with a good presentation. I just couldn't really taste the special marinate in the chicken

Service (5/5): Hands down excellent. There were two waitresses attending to my table. Both were extremely nice,  very helpful and checked on at appropriate times

Atmosphere (5/5): Really transforms you into a different world as soon as you walk in. Very spacious, clean, beautifully decorated. Even the fixtures on the walls and ceilings add to the whole Mexican vibe the restaurant is trying to portray. 

Conclusion: Even though the food is average,  the atmosphere and service definitely compensates.  A must try."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in AZ, hands down.  This place is right at the top of the list of best Mexican I have ever had.  Unfortunately, I do not live very close to this location.  I came here once while in the area for work.  I was super impressed.  If you have a chance to try The Original Garcia's you won't be disappointed.  I can't believe this place doesn't have 100's of reviews on Yelp!  Help spread the word."}
{"text":"We just ordered  take out and the food was horrible.   The meat was spoiled and had a nasty taste.  The taco salad was awful as the lettuce looked like it was setting out for awhile.  The quality has gone down hill. I should have went to  taco bell instead.  Adios Garcia's as we are not coming back."}
{"text":"This is mostly for the current owners.

Read this and you will understand what the two stars (Iv'e experienced better)

This  is hard to write because I used to come here at least twice a month with small to large business groups for years when I worked out of our Phoenix office.  This was a place where the food and the service were consistently above average.  

Although they would always be crowded, they were quick to seat our group without reservations at a clean table where the service was equally fast and friendly.  The food was great, chips and salsa a personal favorite and my favorite sizzling fajitas were always as good as the last time,.

It did not mater if our group was 3 or 12 people they were a well tuned operation that delivered great food at a great price.  My other favorites would be their spinach enchiladas, Carne Asada plate, Caldo De Res and guacamole.  

What I write now is based from in frequent visits over a couple of years.

WTF happened!!!!  This is not my Garcias that I have taken customers, peers and friends to in the past.  The service, food and atmosphere are very different in a negative way.  Was there a change in management, did the family walk away from the business, is third cousin removed Felix running the place?

The service is slow, inefficient, non-attentive and lacks the welcome that was once present and made this place a staple for Mexican food.  food is now bland, inconsistent and does not have the same freshness that you could count on when I came regularly from 2006-2014.  

I do not write this to scare people away because the current Garcia's Management is doing that without any help at all.  I write this because I want things to go back to the way they were and Garcia's to be the place I cannot wait to not only eat, but to share the experience with others, and I know I am not alone in my opinion. 

Iv'e experienced better at the old Garcias, and I would give five stars to that one everyday of the week! 

By the way, chips and salsa are still good.

Get it together....."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for at least 20 years now.  I love the decor, so do the out of town visitors, and it is very clean.  I love the salsas, hot and mild, as well as their chips.  We have ordered the bean dip for appetizer and it was very flavorful.  My favorites here are the green chili (burro or other) and chili relleno.  For lunch, the prices are great and the orders come out very quickly. The only complaint is that sometimes they don't have bussers on staff to refill your drinks so you might be left thirsty.  Other than that, it's a great hangout."}
{"text":"I used to come here with my dad all the time. However today our experience was not so pleasant. I do not appreciate your hostess rudely greeting not my father or myself but my knee to your restaurant this evening. Said hostess asked if I had a cut while I walked into your faculty and I replied with I just had surgery. She proceeded to stare at me as if I had twelve faces or was the ghost of Christmas past. We were seated and A woman rudely placed our chips and salsa down and asked if we were leaving.  Our server came and took our orders and was far from friendly. Our food came and the chimi platter I ordered was bland and my father's meal was atrocious looking. The meat was so runny, the rice was overly cooked and the beans were even mushier than the runny so called meat.  After we finished our less than perfect meals the same hostess whipped her head around the bar as if she were an owl to say her goodbyes to my leg. I quickly responded to her with the following statement \" did you get a close enough look or would you like to take a picture?\" She reponded with a \" I was trying to say goodbye.\" She also gave me one of the least sincere apologies I've ever heard. I've never felt so belittled by someone who didn't even speak and it would serve your restaurant right to teach your hostess some manners and proper authentic Mexican cooking skills you claim to have. Thanks. Regards. Kathryn Mindlin. I give you a -4 star rating."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican restaurant I have eaten at in Arizona.  After our dining experience here I will only eat here. Their service,the atmosphere, and the food was wonderful."}
{"text":"This is it. When it comes to rating great Mexican restaurants, this is the one I use as a measuring stick. The food is outstanding, the menu extensive, the atmosphere festive and the service more like eating at a friend's home than a large restaurant. I recommend everything, but have a particular fondness for their tamales. Whenever I am in Phoenix, whether for business or pleasure, it's a sure bet I'll eat at least once at The Original Garcia's. All my friends who live there love it, and friends and family who I've taken there do, too."}
{"text":"What the shell?! I never reviewed this place?! I have been going to Garcia's ever since I was a kid. My grandmother loved this place back when it was just a small hole in the wall south of mcdowell off of 35th ave... since my grandmother's day - it moved north to new digs a lil north of mcdowell.

Infact, my dad worked on constructing their current digs. So yeah, me and Garcia's go waaay back! haha!! Everytime I enter into their adobe lookin' house into their old world styled living room type waiting area. it's nice and antique but it could use a revamping. It's looked like this since I could remember! I am greeted by a 'round the way girl some Carl Hayden graduate who says hello and leads you into one of their many dining areas. 

The large dining area has a raised celings and open spaces and have large murals depicting different places in Mexico and these wooden tables and huge leather chairs. Now I love the chairs... but they eaither need to be tighten their screws or get new ones because their chairs get more and more wobbly with each visit. I'm afraid I'm going to brake one one of these days! 

The service is a two prong attack. There's a server/waiter who takes your order and brings you your first round of drinks and then will bring your food and your check... but then there's bus boys who will refill your drinks, salsa and chips and will bring you extra napkins and the smaller things you may need. I personally like this, because sometimes it can be tough getting our servers's attention because they can get pretty busy. Utilizing their bussers means that I never go long without being asked if I need something. YAY!! However, I usually tip a lil extra to cover the busser's share and sometimes if the busser is crazy cool (one of them snuck me a free bag of chips & salsa once!) then I sometimes tip them seperately. 

I grew up dining on their tacos and I must admit - I don't really care for them. BOO!  But their rice and flautas are pretty good. but NOTHING tops their salsa & soup. Their salsa is so clean fresh and cool flavor. it's nice and mild but sooo flavorful! I love it! :) 

The soup is the showboat of this resturant in my eyes. I feel if you go... you MUST try their caldo! I have yet to try their menudo as I always forget about it whenever I'm there during the weekend. I am in LOVE with their Caldo... it's pretty much veggie beef stew. It's wonderfully not as thick as other stews, huge pieces of potato with zuccinini, corn, green beans, carrots, onion, celery and cabbage. Only rez'd out grandma's make it better! Please give it a try!!

Other dishes I dug there was the Pollo Fundido, miniature sampler and fajitas. I had their carnitas and wasn't that impressed with them. But the Minature sampler is where it's at! I loves it and the white sour creamtype sauce that comes with it. :) 

Over all, I'm glad I have this resturant in my family's history. It's actually quite good. It's not too far from my house and it's my mom's favorite place. I just can't dig their tacos and their beans always need salt. Meh. The service is decent but it can be a pain to get parking. The place needs to be redecorated and revamped a lil. It's one of my regular haunts and i always leave happy and full of chips, salsa and caldo! 

To my yelpers: if you decide to go... PLEASE try the caldo, it's really the best thing ever! and enjoy your salsa and don't have high expectations of the beans but the rice will be awesome! Oh and don't be afraid to ask the busser for anything!! just be careful to tip a lil extra if you do utilize the bussers' services! :)"}
{"text":"The food was good, but our server was awful and rude
I went with my family there were 8 of us. The server just knew he was going to add the tips to our bill. But I would have still like to be serve . Our bus girl did more then him. He was very rude to her too like he owned her.
We would go back but just ask for another server."}

The manager didn't come to our table for about 10 minutes and then took the plate and disappeared. Our waiter then came back and told us they wouldn't charge us for anything we ate. They also didn't offer me a replacement dish or apologize. Very disgusting and will never go back."}
{"text":"Margaritas were ok, they had a different level of booze each time. The happy hour price for a house marg. was what I would normally pay for non-happy hour anywhere else. The location is pretty sketch. The service is pretty non-existent. Our server got to us pretty soon after we sat down, so I figured the other reviews had sparked some change in them, but I soon found out this was not the case. It took 10+ minutes to get drinks that were ordered. One drink too 20+ minutes. It took 30 minutes for our server to run our checks. .They were not busy at all, the place is HUGE and there were maybe 20 tables with at least 7 servers that I saw. The chip buffet was just weird, the salsa was nice and cold, but the chips tasted like vinegar. The only thing they gave you to put chips on was a small side plate, kind of difficult to put chips on."}
{"text":"I have lived in the Valley of the Sun for nearly 13 years and I just found out about The Original Garcia's.    Serious props to a friend for mentioning it because this place is great.  The BF and I have been lacking a good regular Mexican joint (as opposed to the gourmet spin of Barrio Café) and The Original Garcia's will definitely be in our rotation going forward.  This place offers good food at a good value, which is just the thing during a recession.  The décor is fun without getting into the whole chain restaurant kitsch and this place is HUGE.  It's great for large groups.  

The Appetizer Combination is a must.  The miniature items are tasty and oh so cute!  The chimichangas rock.  Oh to luxuriate in that crazy good sauce they use to enrobe the chimis!  The combo beef and chicken fajitas were tasty, too.  The fresh limes were a nice touch and the guacamole was tasty with a refreshingly ample portion.  We'll be back!

Some reviewers talk about his place being in the 'hood.  The neighborhood is marginal, but it's not like you have to dodge stray bullets in the parking lot."}

{"text":"Usually we have great service and food when we visit this location. Tonight, not so much. We sat for 15 minutes before our server even noticed we had been seated. No drink refills, and my daughter and I had to share a napkin because our server Julio couldn't be bothered to check on us after our food came out. We ordered a plate for my husband to go since he was working and couldn't join us for dinner. That was when our server decided to end our meal, even though we weren't finished, and offer boxes for our food and deliver our check. Sure, I guess we'll just leave then....
The food is good, just don't sit in Julio's section if you like to have clean hands/face or enjoy a cold beverage while you eat."}
{"text":"I'm from Las Vegas and my boyfriend took me on a date here when I was visiting him out in AZ he got the number 10 which was a combo with an insane amount of food for a reasonable price and I got the shrimp quesadilla which was equally as huge and fantastic . The food was great but what really stood out was the level of customer service provided by our server Josh! He was awesome, had great recommendations and was extremely friendly. Being from Las Vegas I have relatively high standards of customer service and they were all met at this wonderful family oriented restaurant!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very charming throughout.  The food and service is good.   This place is always busy and it's a good lunch or dinner spot.  From all the Garcia's this one is my favorite because of the ambience.   It looks like a very traditional Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! The Sonoran enchilada is the best.  Waitress took my order and delivered just as requested.  I am a picky eater.  I always change what's on the menu, drives my family crazy.  Waitress was so sweet.  I come here all the time and have never been disappointed.  You have to try the chicken tortilla soup.  I have to say I think its the best in town."}

{"text":"This review could be very long as I've been eating here since  it's original, original location was on 35th Ave S. of McDowell (yup I'm that old school). However I'm going to try to keep it short. This place is THE measuring stick I use to measure all other Sonoran Mexican fare. I love the shredded beef tacos. When I'm craving a good taco this is where I head. I'm totally known to come in & order one shredded beef taco with a diet Pepsi & then eat my weight in the chips & salsas. The fajitas are delicious & served hot & sizzling. This place has the best Sonoran Enchiladas. I get them without meat & don't tell my Mom but they are better then hers. The take out is where I get my fave dinner salad in town. I know it's not Mexican fare but I eat it with my Mexican fork the tortilla chip so that makes it Mexican right? Well in any case when you're having a craving for Sonoran Mexican food this is the THE place. I don't reccomend any Garcia's location but the original as you will be disappointed after eating at the original. 
Tip - make sure & ask for the hot sauce when they bring the chips as for some reason they stopped bringing that automatically with the salsa."}
{"text":"I want to dispel a few of the previous reviews statements regarding service. The hostess was friendly and took us to our table right away!  Our waiter was super friendly and even a bit funny! He made a joke about wearing a \"dessert cam\" to see the funny expressions people make when he offers dessert. The portions sizes at Garcia's are LARGE people... so the joke made both my wife and I laugh.

Now on to the food: I'm originally from Kansas and this style of Mexican food reminded me of Midwestern Mexican food. I'm not saying it's bad. Quite to the contrary... I REALLY enjoyed it! But I understand some of the digs this place gets for not being authentic. Honestly, I don't care about all that. There's plenty of traditional authentic Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. This place is a mash-up of Southwest, Midwest, and Mexican that ends up being super saucy, super cheesy, and super delicious. I love the food here. 

Spinach Con Queso is a really tasty appetizer. I had the dinner combo #1 with cheese enchilada, red tamale, taco, rice and beans. Did I mention the portion sizes are enormous? They are. The chips and salsa were also tasty. Chips were hot and fresh. Salsa was zippy without being overly spicy.

The food was piping hot and super gooey melty cheesy. The rice was mildly flavored but nicely paired with their beans. On the whole I had no complaints.

The service was fast and friendly. The food was good. The decor was festive and fun. The dining room is enormous and my wife and I were immediately seated on a Friday night at 6:45pm. There was also a couple of guys with guitars going around playing for people. It wasn't overly loud or annoying. I thought the two were passing good guitar players and decent enough singers. It was a fun atmosphere. No complaints there either.

My advice: try this place for yourself. Don't discount Garcia's because of a few bad reviews. I really enjoyed this place and you may come to enjoy it as well. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I go here almost weekly for lunch with co-workers. It's everything you want in a Mexican restaurant: bottomless fresh chips and salsa before your food comes, enormous portions of delicious Mexican dishes, and a very attentive and polite staff. I've tried every lunch special on the menu and they will all leave you satisfies and ready for a siesta."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place due to the reviews. I left disappointed feeling the experience was a bit above average, at best. It started off well with a tasty appetizer sampler and flavorful salsa with chips but it quickly went downhill when the entree arrived. The carnitas I ordered were dry, obviously not very fresh. The sauce had a nice unique flavor, very mole-esque but I did not enjoy it due to the shoe leather meat. The corn tortillas that came with the carnitas were borderline brittle, not moist and soft as they should be. The beans and rice were good and my wife raved about the flan. I opted to pass on dessert. The ambiance was very inviting and put together with the standard Mexican restaurant decor. Everything considered, I don't think I will back. There are plenty of Mexican restaurants much closer to me where the food is at least equal to or better than The Original Garcia's."}
{"text":"i visited here with a group of 15 of my closest friends. ok, we are not that close, but we were a party of 16. mine was the only meal they messed up, so there's that. everyone else was quite happy. then they managed to make me what i actually ordered (spinach enchilada dinner) in record time, although with enough char on the tortillas to make it impossible to cut through, even with a knife that i had to ask for special."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good Mexican Restaurant and based off the Yelp reviews thought we would try the Original Garcia's.

First, we are seated and given chips and salsa and menus and are the only people in our area of the restaurant (it was only 4:00pm). As we sat there others were placed around us so there were about six tables full. A waiter comes out and starts taking everyone's order around us but not ours and we were the first ones there and now have been waiting about 15 minutes. I get upset but decide that he just didn't know the order we arrived and is confused so I wait. He disappears and doesn't show back up and everyone else has had their order taken but we still have not. I see the chip gal walking by and say \"can you please get our waiter?\" and she says \"she is running late and isn't here yet\". I'm like...what the hell are you talking about?  All of a sudden we see a woman in a Garcia's shirt come running by with her purse and goes into the back and puts it down and comes back to our table and says \"sorry, I was running late\". Are you kidding me? They sat me in a section and the waitress wasn't at work yet and let us sit there for 30 minutes getting pissed off and didn't take our order?

Was also disappointed in the meal as there wasn't much flavor in any dish we had and would not drive the 40 minutes again to get to this place. The salsa had no spice to it and was very unimpressed with the entire meal.

To make it worse I get out in the parking lot and some idiot has his car parked two inches from the drivers side door of my car which I don't know how he did without hitting my car. I had to enter my car through the passenger side and so much wanted to find the guy and curse him out for being an idiot but thought better of it when I remembered what neighborhood I was in.

There are better Mexican Restaurants closer to home and certainly wouldn't travel all the way to Maryvale again just to eat here."}
{"text":"Everything from the service to the food is just mediocre. Not authentic at all, but a good spot if you're looking for something with a ton of space. The rice is DEFINITELY less than 1 star, the beans are about a 1, but the salsa is pretty good so I'd give it a 4. The baja sauce is also good. It tastes similar to Macayo's baja sauce.  In fact, their entire menu tastes like Macayo's if you're wanting a comparison."}
{"text":"Despite being founded oh so many moons ago and being one of the older continuously-operating restautants in town, Garcias las Avenidas does little to distinguish itself from the local chain that shares its name. 

The food is typical gringo Sonoran style. That in itself isn't a complaint. Sometimes a girl just wants a taco and an enchilada, and the original Garcia's provides that just fine. They also provide good service, though on occasion it's also slow service, particularly after the meal when we'd like to get the check and get out. And most recently they also provide loud, obnoxious kids that crawl over people's tables, throw food, and climb walls. Seriously. I was hoping someone would stop this one kid from using a retaining wall as a balance beam before he fell and hurt himself, but then when nobody did I was almost hoping he'd fall so his oblivious family would leave. I don't expect a business to watch other people's kids but I do expect them to say something when a kid (or an adult for that matter) is disrupting the meals of every other customer in the place. And this sort of circus is happening at Garcia's with greater frequency. 

Still, they provide a better Meximerican meal than Macayo's, Manuel's or Arriba, so they stay on my OK list for now."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since we moved to Phoenix and it was great.
Never had any problems with the food , or service or the restaurant.
Mind you, we've been here weekends and week days. Busy or slow time and no issues.
I have enjoyed \"brunch\" time on Sunday's sitting on the patio sipping a mimosa and eating Huevos Ranchero.
But this past year the quality has just seemed to have gone down. The food is not as tasty as it used to be , the quality seems as if they have changed suppliers to save on cost since the textures on some of our choices has been a bit off.
Two months or so we went in for dinner and the enchiladas just seemed like the cheese was thrown in and microwaved. The spicy \"Mexican\" flavors were non existent. And my husband kept pointing out the lack of cleanliness inside as well. The decorations are dusty and there were cobwebs! Ouch!
Last night we went in and there was just no flavor and the tortillas for the enchiladas tasted old :(
There are other places to try. 
I'm still looking that great Mexican food!"}
{"text":"We have family dinner once a month and this was my pick.  The place was packed on a Friday night but we were warmly greeted and seated almost immediately, which made me happy as I have an aversion to excessive wait times and tend to get cranky.

Once seated, we set about getting caught up.  Our waiter was efficient, unobtrusive, and nonplussed by the requests for separate checks.  He had also made sure our table had a baby seat for my great-niece, in place before we even asked for it

The food and drinks were yummy.  We are natives and require Mexican and Margaritas at least monthly.  This really hit the spot.  The restaurant is cute and welcoming, not to mention a Phoenix institution.  Try it, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"My Garcia's experience consisted of a red beef tamale and a fried ice cream.  And best of all, I decided to order them both at the same time and eat them both for my lunch.  The tamale was so so, but I really did enjoy the fried ice cream as the ice cream did not melt too much and it was covered with strawberries and syrup.  And it was coated in a delicious granola/corn flake batter...never had anything like that in Cali."}
{"text":"Has quite a homey feel to it.  The food was great, service was good.  The atmosphere was was really great.  $5.25 non happy hour margaritas too!!  Good spot to take family as well."}
{"text":"Took forever to get seated on a empty day. Took even longer to get our drinks. Didnt have time to wait 
Another 30 mins to get our food so left. They are not the same"}
{"text":"Only thing good about this place is their chips and salsa. The rest of their food is just horrible!!!! After waiting for more than 45 minutes, the waitress came and told us that the computer went down and cooks couldn't print out the orders. When the food FINALLY arrived (over an hour), it was awful. The bean dip, is literally just refried beans and a bit of cheese, no flavor. The chicken salad bowl had a weird taste to it and the \"chicken\" looked and smelled like tuna fish. The nachos seemed to be sitting for a while, since more than half of the chips were soggy and cold. Our family of 8 left majority of the food, since we were full from having chips and salsa. We will definitely not be coming back again. 

Please save your money and enjoy the other great Mexican restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"We went to eat there a couple of nights ago because we were starving and were on our home. The chips and salsa were great, the service was slow (it was on a Friday night but hardly anyone was there). We ordered a cheese crisp and there wasn't anything crisp about it. It was limp, oily and tasteless. We also ordered the mini chimis and they were so gross that we refused to pay for them after one bite. Now, I am normally a very easy to please person but this was ridiculous. We walked out paying for 2 sodas, and one limp cheese crisp. I have vowed never to go there again no matter how hungry I am. Ew."}
{"text":"Genuine Mexican Food, quality and Hospitality!  Customer Service 100, & The Women Waiters  Love My Son & I.  The Mariachi Band comes to Play live sometimes, which is also Dope As Heck!"}
{"text":"When we first pulled into the parking lot (on Friday evening), we thought for sure there was going to be a wait. I ran in to put our name on the list. To my surprise, the hostess sat us immediately. The restaurant inside is huge! So much room, I can't imagine there's ever much of a wait. It is also beautiful inside. 
The service was excellent. They give you a large bowl of chips, even for just the two of us. There was still some left when we were done.  A lot of other places give these little tiny bowls, with about 15 chips in it to share, which is ridiculous. The waitress was very good. We received our food right away. Even our waitress walked by and said, \"That was fast!\" All of the food was very hot, incredibly delicious, and lots of it. We both really enjoyed the complete experience."}
{"text":"Grew up this spot!!! Everytime my childhood buddy comes in from NY we all get together here. Food is amazing !!! Came here last week for my birthday with a party of 18 and the waitress was on top of everything. This is the only Garcias that we go to as this one is still family owned and not Franchised as the others."}
{"text":"Not good,ordered taco salad,had to be worst I've ever eaten,no beans in salad like menu says,ordered ground beef,got shredded beef,menu says came with sauce none given,very bland taste overall.service was spotty at best."}
{"text":"Today at work we decided to order Mexican food for lunch.  Someone had mentioned Garcia's, and they also mentioned the \"best\" Garcia's.  I thought to myself, if you are talking about the Garcia's at Metro Center Mall or near Arrowhead YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!  If this is what you consider to be the \"BEST\" Garcia's than you are FAR out of line...

Somehow, I knew something was different as soon as I looked at the menu.  First, THE PRICES ARE NOT NEARLY AS EXPENSIVE AS THE CHAIN!!!!  I was pleasantly surprised at the cost of the combination plates.  Second, the menu stated THE ORIGINAL GARCIA'S.  Original I thought?  Hmm...something definitely was different.  Last, I found out it was located on 35th Ave and Encanto.  I knew immediately I was in for a different treat.

I placed my order, chicken flauta with rice and beans for $6.75.  Didn't expect much but was surprised when the meal arrived.  

Observation One: HOLY SALSA.  I am NOT messing around!  They gave me two large salsa containers (one hot, one more pico) for my to go order.  SCORE!  But hey, where are the chips?

Observation Two:  HOLY GUACAMOLE!  Literally!  This stuff wasn't watered down with sour cream.  It didn't have an odd brown color from being too old.  It was super fresh, super delicious, and super avacado-ey.  AND, my flauta was covered in it!

Observation Three:  The flauta was fried to a perfect consistency.  The chicken was not dry, and the flauta was of a reasonable size.  The rice and beans were delicious and mildy flavored.  I added extra salsa to them to kick it up a notch.

After I ate the food I decided to go online and do a little bit of research about them.  Come to find out, the shady and lame flavors of the Garcia's I was accustomed to were from their sold brand...I now know about the authenticity of this location!

In either case, give it a try.  Delicious flavors for an affordable price!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I had not been here fir about a year.  I ordered a green chicken enchilada and was given a red one.  The salsa was bland as well as the food.  Either my taste buds were on strike or their food did just not come up to the level of Manuel's, Macayo's, Rio Mirage, and even Taco Bell.  I used to love their food.  Not sure what happened.  Different chef or cooks."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the building both inside and out with its nice decor.  We were seated promptly and our waitress was over with menus and took our drink order immediately (and it was relatively busy).  I ordered the spinach enchilada while my wife went with the cheese enchiladas.  The chips were good but the salsa lacked any kick at all but I did like the way they had the salsa in a pitcher and just came around and poured you more when they saw you running low.  The meal was very good and I very rarely eat the rice as I just don't care for it but the rice was very flavorful so that was a nice surprise.  The service though was excellent as they refilled our drinks before we had to ask and were there for the extra napkins I asked for, etc. Often, you order, you get your order and maybe once during your meal you will see your waitress but here, they were very attentive.  I took the one star off for the lack of 'pep' in the salsa although it was good just needed at least a little kick!"}
{"text":"Am I the only person who dislikes the food here?? I have eaten here many times because my husband's family loves this place. I find the food to be greasy and tasteless. The chips and salsa are good though. Last week I decided to try the avocado chicken salad. It was served in a crunchy bowl which was nice. Unfortunately the two tomato slices on top were inedible. They were green and I couldn't even stab them with my fork. 
I also tried the fried ice cream. It was made with some cheap vanilla ice cream that would not even melt when left sitting in the dish for 10+minutes. 
I really don't understand the appeal of this place! 
The rest room is disgusting too!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and love this place! =) 

This was my first time visiting the restaurant after discussing where to eat, our fiend finally suggested this one and so we went..It was quite a drive from the east side of town but we were not disappointed. The place looks very inviting that it reminded me of the movie Mask of Zorro and A Walk in the Clouds where they have those mansions with yellow paint with wall murals and nice potteries, it made me smile right away. It just feels homey. Service is fast and good, a basket full of chips and small bowl of salsa were immediately served as you sit down. Our server that night was very helpful, accommodating and very nice. I ordered the Sonoran Enchilada dinner which is not your usual enchilada from other places. This one is served with rice and beans and the enchilada is done like a pancake, never had this before but it was sooo good! I ended bringing the rest of it home. The hubbie was craving for a some sort of bean dip so we got a side of the bean sauce they have..And boy! This was more than yummie!! Really delicious!! We finished the whole platter!! heehee Pricing is also very affordable with the big serving you get. 
This place is worth the drive! =)"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here as we were traveling through. Everything went so well we wanted to leave a review behind to recommend this amazing restaurant. Everything we ate was excellent from steaks to enchiladas, even the coffee was exceptional. The service was extremely prompt and attentive, the food came quickly and exactly as we had ordered it. Our waitress was cheerful and attentive and took very good care of us. I can highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for wonderful food with excellent service."}
{"text":"this place is home to me. my family has been celbrating special occasions at this place for as long as i can remember the magaritas are great and they keep em coming... the cilantro cream cheese  served with their mini combination plate is what keeps me coming back and the green chile tamales YUM!!!"}
{"text":"This may just be our new favorite Mexican restaurant! Hubby and I were seated immediately, got drinks and chips right away, and settled in to look at the large menu. Hubby immediately saw the Pollo Fundido and when I told him a fellow Yelper had recommended it (thanks, Alexander!) he was done looking. Indeed, he was not steered wrong- it was an absolutely delicious combination of tender and moist chicken mixed with seasonings and topped with cream cheese and melted cheddar. I love carnitas, and so decided to give theirs a try. Holy wow- so well seasoned and savory and yet magically, you could still really taste the pork. Super tender, as well- it must have been cooked for many many hours. The beans that came on both of our molten hot plates were really good. I like it when there is actual texture to refried beans rather than a puree, and these were chunky and flavorful with melted cheese on top. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican rice, but this at least had pieces of vegetable in it and a good flavor.

We got a fried ice cream to share (thanks, Julie!) and it was huge and delicious, topped with strawberries and whipped cream. The service was warm, friendly and attentive- like being taken care of by an aunt. To top it all off, and what tipped my rating from 4 to 5 stars, was the price- $32 for two hearty entrees, beer, sodas, and dessert?!? Easily one of the best values in a quality sit-down restaurant we've had in a long time. Garcia's is going in our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Best ground beef enchiladas in the valley.  The red sauce is to die for and they are not affiliated with the chain Garcia's so no disgusting food drowning in oil here.  

I have been coming here since the 90's and sometimes drive out of my way from Tempe to get their enchiladas.  

They also have another building on the same property that has a drive through serving the same food as the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here today, we're on way to Rita's Mexican restaurant just down street and my husband saw Garcias and wanted to go there instead. BIG MISTAKE. Food was awful...Fatitas tasted liked boiled steak, onions and bell peppers were so overlooked they were mush, and a disgusting taste like really old oil. The retried beans were the only thing halfway tasty!  Rice was also mush and the guacamole was runny...hate to think what they add to that to increase their profit.  on the way home had horrible taste in mouth, had to brush teeth .nasty food and fear the kitchen is probably dirty....NEVER AGAIN...worst Mexican food I've ever had anywhere!"}
{"text":"Blah guacamole.  Beans were good.  Taco very greasy.  Enchilada quite greasy.  Don't even want to think about the fat content of my meal.  Yes I know Mexican food for the most part is fatty but this was excessively so.  Service OK.  Food came out quickly.  I've certainly had better Mexican food especially considering we drove almost an hour to get there.  Loved the decor!  Good lunch specials.  Parking lot really crowded."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled! This is the best Garcia's in AZ! Truly the original. Being a native to AZ this is my favorite Mexican food spot.  The service is always good and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"First time here, our waitress Rita, was very knowledgeable with menu and helped us with our order. Had the chicken polo and burrito. We had 5 people at our table and they remembered what we ordered, kept our glasses full and checked back on us. For sure if you like Mexican then here is the place to go. Very reasonable prices"}
{"text":"The take out is awful.... I have went a couple of times and this place used to be really good but now it's just bad. This used to be my favorite place. I'm very upset the past couple of times my food was inedible and the salsa was spoiled. I have taken back food and was refunded or a credit.... After this last time I won't be returning. The actual restaurant is even getting bad still okay but it's getting there.... The employees in the take out are rude bad attitude and look like they don't care about their jobs. They're leaning over the counters without greeting guests. It's just all bad.... They changed the chips they are so bad they made a bad call on that.... Food is bland like it had been sitting there for a while. I live on 35 th and Glendale by the time I got home the gaucamole was brown so I couldn't eat that... Rice was bland beans were dry... I was very disappointed since I have been coming here since I was a kid and my favorite place and they didn't have horchata."}
{"text":"Not impressed, food is stale. Anything beyond the chips and salsa is a mistake. Better off going to Ta Carbon on 43rd ave. Ingredients are not the best, but people think anything is good when they don't know good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Garcia's ever since I can remember. Was my favorite place to eat. I am so very disappointed in what has become of the food quality. Not what it used to be. The service was so so."}
{"text":"I lived in Phoenix for years and returned to be extremely disappointed with both the service and quality. Took 30 minutes to get my food on a slow night, plus the waiter gave our food to another table. All in all, no longer a fan here."}
{"text":"Mexican food at it's peak. This beautiful restaurant is gorgeous, authentic, and a true Phoenix gem. There is no compromise here, a Mexican food oasis. Fives stars for the original :-)"}
{"text":"I honestly expected more authentic Mexican food coming to the original location. Unfortunately that is not what I got. The food was very greasy and the taste was bland. The salsa was not good which I think can make a restaurant. The salsa is important this reminded me of the bottled Paste salsa.

I'm only giving 2 stars due to the service. And the Bloody Mary I drank which was good. Other than that the food was mediocre. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is not what it used to be! Disappointing for sure. Food cold when served. Men's restroom is so smelly, it's disgusting!! Will not be back, EVER!"}
{"text":"Great place! I've been to this location twice now and I was completely satisfied both times. Great food ,friendly service all at a reasonable price. Added plus they have a to go building right across the street! So next time your in a hurry don't feel like you have to settle for some drive thru catastrophe."}
{"text":"What? Only a 4 star average for this place? And only 27 reviews? Come on Phoenix!

I admit, If all I care about is the food, I'm heading to Carolina's.

However- you can't really relax at Carolina's. No one waits on you, no matter how transcendant the food is you're always hearing someone yell \"Number 27!\" \"Number 28!\". God help you if it's summer.

Garcia's, although still in the ghetto, is somewhere you can go, relax, be waited on, enjoy free chips and salsa before the meal, and enjoy a pleasant conversation friendly environment. 

As for the food- I've never had a bad meal here. The rice is the best in the city. It's really moist without being wet, there are chunks of real tomatoes in it. They have dishes that you can't get just everywhere like fish dishes and my favorite, chili con carne- very similar to how my mom makes it, but they have a green version as well as a red version.  

I've taken my boss from out of town here, dates... (well, escorts.. same thing...), and friends here (again... escorts, but...  )  and everyone of them were like in a happy daze afterwards. Blissed out like heroin junkies.. 

I think two of them were on heroin.. but still it's really really good food. 

I love you Garcias Las Avenidas! Only 2 more months till my 1 year ban is lifted!

(you all know I kid.. right?)"}
{"text":"I had the Pollo fundido ... The chicken dry as the desert sand and had a similar texture. The beans were nasty and the rice way over cooked and mushy. This was a sad state of affairs.."}
{"text":"Horrible service ,good food ..the food is why they get 1 star however the service sucked waited 4 ever and seemed like out server disappeared. Don't go there go to taco bell."}
{"text":"Came here with my office for appetizers. Dated place, slow service. This is the worst food I have ever had in Phoenix.  It is inedible.  This is NOT MEXICAN FOOD.  Salsa - The tomato base comes from a can of tomato sauce, with added pieces of onion. Had one taste and was sickening. You are better off buying a salsa from the grocery store.  In fact, why they don't just do that?  Buy the big jars from Costco.  Most likely cost.  Low quality giving highest returns.   Beans - Again, cheap can of refried beans with no taste and sweet after-taste (awful).  Better to buy a can of beans at the grocery store than this crap.  Hundred times better tasting. Cheese quesadilla - I took a look at that and just couldn't stomach it. Taquitos - just bad.  Guacamole - smoothie-like consistency, likely frozen variety.  Why can't they just buy the fresh guacamole that all the grocery stores sell?  Why do they have to serve this garbage?  The one thing that was OK was the queso fundido with spinach.  Needless to say there were tons of leftovers.  Overall, a terrible place for happy hour."}
{"text":"My dad has driven by this place on his way to work, so we decided to try it out tonight. Adorable looking inside, I should have taken a \"tourist\" photo lol. Good size menu- happy all day Sunday?!? What?!?!!!! Yay and mon-fri 3-7pm. I can't remember if it said thru say tbh, so I'll leave that up to you to find out. 
Food was good. Service was ok, took a while to bring us happy hour menu. They were on top of the chip refill. Good salsa. Overall nice and cute place. Definitely going back. If you're from LA, it's like El Torito and Los Toros kinda (minus the losstoros dip!)"}
{"text":"So so Yummy!  Best spinach con queso ever....tamales are excellent too!"}
{"text":"Do not mistake it for the chain. Its the only one we love. 

Green chile burro enchilada style, pollo fundido, chips and salsa. 

You will not go wrong. We drive 15 miles to eat here, and continue doing so!"}
{"text":"This place is...... ok. The enchilada sauce is pretty nasty if I am being honest. I don't ever want to come to Garcia's, but if the rest of the lunch bunch does I only order tostadas. Stay away from anything with that enchilada sauce..... trust me. The staff is friendly and its a pretty quick lunch. If you are with a large group keep your eyes open when they bring the drinks! I have seen a co-worker or two wear their drink home! lol"}
{"text":"First time here. Was very impressed with the food and drinks. Prices are reasonable as well. I had the spinach enchilada, and it was delicious! The strawberry Margarita was tasty as well. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Garcia's for years and have never been disappointed. Well tonight I was. Took server 10 mins to get our drink order we of course ordered our food at the sometime as drinks. When the food came out it was cold my order was wrong they offered to fix it but I was not looking to wait any longer to eat. When I picked up my taco it was so soggy it fell apart .My husbands food was cold also we just don't beleive in wasting food Never did see our waitress but the chip and salsa lady was on top of her job. It was not that busy so I just couldn't understand what the problem was. Garcia's is one of my favorite places and we travel about 30 miles to go. I won't be going back for awhile. : ("}
{"text":"So disappointed in the service. We are long time customers...over 35 years. When we come to town it is always a place we go...but this is the last time for us. The whole interior is dirty & neglected...bathroom is dirty was awful. Nothing but a good cleaning & fresh paint wouldn't hurt.
The original founder, Julio, is turning over in his grave with what has happened to his legacy."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour Lounge, with treats and plenty of spirit being offered. Tortilla chips are thin and light tasting that complement the two varieties of red chili salsa while enjoying Corona lights!"}
{"text":"Well, 
Since the last review. We have moved to the Phoenix area. And we come here often! Nothing has changed, food is one of the best in the area. There are others that are just as good, but this place impresses us every time we go."}
{"text":"My grandmother worked here like a hundred years ago before it moved to the current location on 35th Ave. So...I have been eating here since the beginning of time, which was, of course, the day i was born.  The food is always good.  I love love the salsa.  The hot sauce is not my favorite but whatev.  If you do not speak spanish you might also have trouble with the staff and sometimes they are not the friendliest but thats ok with me becuase the food is always good. : )"}
{"text":"This place may have decent food but the employees at the drive thru are ghetto. My son went in to order a quesadilla. That's it a quesadilla we waited over 30 minutes for 1 quesadilla. I finally went inside to see why it was taking so long since people who had larger orders and ordered after him were given there food prior. He was basically overlooked since he was a kid. I asked one of the chola girls there if the quesadilla was going to be ready anytime soon since it had been more than an 1/2 hour she said what did you order. I said my son ordered a quesadilla but apparently he was over looked she just said oh ok she yelled back at the 3 stooges that were cooking the food and singing like they were at home laughing and just said yeah it's almost done. WOW !!

The other people waiting noticed that my son was over looked as well one of the ladies told them they should give him 2 since he had waited so long but she was ignored. 

This place need to send there employees to Finishing school."}
{"text":"As a Phoenix native - one who frequented the original location at 35th & McDowell, I'm nothing but disappointed in this restaurant.

None of the original flavors are present, from the hot sauce with too much vinegar, to the chicken tacos, green chile, or even the rice.

If you're looking for old school flavors  the original Garcias used to serve back in the day, try:

Pancho's (So.Cental Ave) or their kid's place - Some Burros - The Vasquez family still does it right.
TeePee - The Duran family is still serving up their original recipes since the 60's.

{"text":"It was Monday evening and I was looking for a good place to take my boyfriend to dinner. We yelped and both decided on this one. We got there and waited to be seated for 10 minutes( there was a party in front of us) I was extremely excited and hungry to try the delicious food that was on the menu. After being seated we waited for about 20 minutes until we decided to get up and leave. 20 minutes and not a single employee was kind enough to ask if we needed drinks or if we had been helped. I'm a waitress( at a Mexican food tortas el tri on 75th and Thomas. ) and have never ignored a table no matter how busy it is. Come and see us instead."}
{"text":"A lunch companion and I visited Garcias this afternoon for a quick lunch.  As we entered the restaurant  we were greeted and seated immediately. The decor in Garcias is warm and inviting with its Spanish architecture, paint, tiles and Mexican music in the background. 

As we were seated our chips, salsa,  and drinks arrived almost immediately.  The chips are served hot with chunky red salsa and a refried bean dip. The chips are hot, very thin, crispy and salted perfectly and the bean dip is delicious.

The menu at Garcias has a good variety of entrees, all reasonably priced for a full service establishment. The staff at Garcias are friendly without being intrusive.  The food is delivered quickly, hot, and plated attractively with generous servings. 

My lunch companion and I both had the lunch special, two beef racos, rice, and beans, the typical Mexican fare.
We enjoyed a good  lunch at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"When I was a teenager I worked at Garcia's Metrocenter. As a lowly busboy at the chain restaurant I learned about how restaurants work. The job also offered me up some amazing Mexican food and all the chips and salsa I could eat. In the years I worked there, those never got old.

Back then, the operations were still watched over by the Garcia family, who had sold the name and concept to a large corporation. Today, the chain serves pretty much some of the most mediocre Mexican food around and many of their stores have closed.

However, the Garcia family wasn't dumb; they kept the best for themselves. The Original Garcia's Las Avenidas in Phoenix is still owned and operated by the Garcia family, as it has been for more than 50 years, and is not connected to the chain. Many of the dishes you remember eating as a kid can still be found and enjoyed here.

From the outside, the building has lush landscaping and a separate building for takeout orders. The interior is reminiscent of an old Spanish home with low slung ceilings and lots of woodwork. The main dining room is cavernous, like walking into a Mexican courtyard, bright and inviting.

Once seated, guests are greeted with a bowl of hot tortilla chips and a cruet of mild chunky tomato salsa. It took me right back to my busboy years. If you prefer more spice, ask for hot sauce, which they will provide upon request. I enjoy mixing the two sauces for a tasty hybrid.

To take advantage of the salsas, a Cheese Quesadilla ($5.50) is a must. I always ask for a side of lettuce and chopped tomatoes so I can adorn each crispy slice, then pour on some salsa.

The menu hasn't changed much over the years, which is a good thing. It's nice to know that you can always order your favorite dish, like my all-time Garcia's favorite the Pollo Fundido ($9.95). They take stewed chicken meat, then wrap it in a flour tortilla and fry it until it's light and crunchy. It's topped with smooth jalapeño cream cheese and slices of cheddar cheese then placed under a broiler until the cheeses are melted and bubbly. Served with rice and beans, each creamy bite is sure to please.

The Combination Appetizer ($9.25) offers hearty miniature-sized versions of Mexican classics. This plate includes miniature beef tacos, beef flautas, beef chimichangas, green corn tamale and refried beans. Give this plate a good dousing of salsa and it'll be hard to stop eating. Aside from the mini chimichangas, the cheesy green corn tamale really hits the spot with hints of sweetness.

If you can avoid eating the crunch flour tortilla shell, the Taco Salad ($7) loaded with seasoned ground beef, might be a healthier choice.

Desserts stick to the classics, such as Flan ($4.50) and Sopapillas ($4.25). My favorite is Deep Fried Ice Cream ($4.75), a ball of hard frozen vanilla ice cream covered in honey and cornflakes then quickly fried so the outside is slightly caramelized and crackled.

While I'll probably never go back to busing tables, the idea of all-you-can eat chips and salsa sure makes it tempting."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place they will accommodate you quickly someone will bring you chips and salsa soon after your seated and take your drink order. BTW they're so good you could eat them all day long. Food is amazing don't be fool and go to a franchise Garcia's totally not the same (won that argument with my husband) their service is absolutely by far great they're on top of everything constantly checking on you making sure your doing good will definitely recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 30 for our office's holiday party. The manager demanded that we have one ticket for the group, When I pointed out that we had reservations and that they had made no effort to seat us together, some were not even in the same room she agreed to allow us to have separate tickets per table but that the tip was going to be added to the bill. The tables were dirty and sticky. 

The food arrived before our drinks did. I had to ask for ice in my iced tea, and was told they were low on ice. The food was mediocre. The salsa was plain it tasted like tomatoes without any salt, garlic, onion or cilantro. I am used to a thick flavorful, spicy enchilada sauce, theirs is like red gravy. The green chile was watery with very little meat inside. A co-worker complained about the tostada being stale, and was told that it couldn't be stale. The server then told my co-worker she just wasn't used to good mexican food. There was no offer to correct the order.

When we left, we made sure that the entire bill was paid including an 18% tip. After I left, I got a call from some staff who were stuck because the manager said someone didn't pay. I returned to pay the bill  and when I got there, they found the money in one of the servers pockets. She says she \"forgot\" that she had put it there. When I asked for an apology and what she was going to do about the problems we had encountered she stared at me coldly and told me \"Nothing\".

The only reason I can think that she still has a job is that she is either family or sleeping with the owner.

I wrote the owners 3 letters, called at least 10 times and no one has gotten back to me. Sadly, this place used to be the best of the best, and now it is the absolute worst!"}
{"text":"Original Garcia's is decent, I think if my wife wasn't an A-list hispanic cook, I would probably rate it higher if comparing to a Chevy's or whatever, but it's average.   You don't see a lot of high-difficulty stuff on the menu, and it's pretty much a different combination of beans, rice, tortilla and your choice of meat. 

I did try the taco salad one afternoon and it was fairly decent.   

If in this part of Phoenix though, it's really the only option - not much to pick from around there."}
{"text":"I figured this would be just like any other Garcia's restaurant, but it's not, it's much better.  The food isn't what I would consider great, but pretty good.  I don't live anywhere near this location, but if I am in the area again, I will stop in for some lunch.

Oh, and I love that they actually have an American Flag flying in their dining room!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for last 17 years..one of the best mexican restaurant.. excellent food and best service.."}
{"text":"I recently went to Garcia's Las Avenidas, on a Friday during Lent. I had the #8, green enchiladas with rice and beans. Sounds good right?....But....the tortillas from the enchiladas where old and hard. The sauce was red and NOT green. The rice tasted old, like from the previous day. The beans also looked old, did not try them at all. ..Now as a disclaimer, I am Mexican, so the standards are high, but this was an awe full meal!!! I like to take a break  from cooking and go some where where the standards at least are half meet my cooking. This evening the standards where not met even half way!!!  The place was not packed and we where given a table right away, the service was good, the atmosphere was good but he meal was awe full!!! I guess I could not have both!!! 
Once shame on you Garcia's Las Avenidas!!!
Hope the second time I go ( may take a long while before I go again), it's a little better or shame on me!!!"}
{"text":"Garcias - la la la la la la la!

my sister sang this as we pulled in to the parking lot. Apparently it was from an old TV jingle from the early 90's. No, I don't remember the jingle nor do I know if it was for this particular Garcias.

I love the red salsa that is made here and what I really love is that they refill it with a pitcher! Yes more please! This is not to say that the food is bland but rather that I like a little bit of chip with my salsa to give some perspeive.

Amazing Guac, I found an entire quarter of an avacado in mine. Rellenos are to die for, none of the thickly battered over fried ones of the bay area. Nice light egg coating and a little bit of cheese. I love their red sauce on enchiladas too.

So yes, I ate a bite from everyone's plate here and was seriously satisfied. The only bummer is that I was on my way to the airport so I didn't get to keep my leftovers. But, my mom is going to have tasty dinner tonight! 

la la la la la la la la!"}
{"text":"I am a second generation Garcia's Las Avenidas patron, as my folks frequented the little taco stand down the street that started the whole thing. I swear instead of a pacifier, my mom put a Garcia's shredded beef taco in my mouth, and its been love ever since.

This is hands down one of my favorite places to get Mexican food and I love that the family has stuck to their roots even as the neighborhood has changed drastically over the years. The staff is friendly and consistent (in other words - go often - and you get treated like family).

I would offer up suggestions for the best menu items, but truthfully I LOVE IT ALL.  Everything is made fresh on-site so quality has never been a question. One thing I would add to Kristin's review is that if you are looking for a deal, the prices at the Take Out center are about 1$ cheaper per item. The only down side is that you can't order Margaritas to go, so if you want one, drink it down while you are waiting for your order to come up.

Since I live about 10 minutes from the location, I usually hop in my car, hit my speed dial to order, and depending on whether or not there are a lot of cars in the drive thru line, cruise right on in to grab my food and go.  

Portions are pretty large, so if you are ordering a two item combo or one of their dinners, plan on leftovers. But where else can you get two meals with chips & salsa for around 10 to 12 bucks??

Oh and did I mention the Fried Ice Cream? Messy as all get out, but OMG is it good!!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for delicious food, this is definitely the place to go. I got the dinner combo and chose the green burro and the cheese enchilada and my fiancé got the ranchero burro. Both meals were so yummy and the portions were nice and big. We also got mango margaritas to drink and they did not skimp on the tequila. All in all we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the only Mexican food restaurant that my husband and I go to on a regular basis. This is the ORIGINAL Garcia's, it is not part of the chain.  We have been eating here since the 1980s and drive from Goodyear when we want good, simple Mexican food.  We have had many family celebrations and regular meals here over the years and hope to continue for many more.

Yes, as stated in other reviews the service can be a little under par at times but everyone has a bad day now and then, right?  And most of the wait staff are friendly and accommodating to our requests.  If you have a problem with the staff or the food just speak with a manager and she will make it right.

The food is good and the portions are generous; the frozen Margaritas are the best I have ever had anywhere.  Just the fact that many other hispanics eat here is proof to me that this is authentic and good Mexican food and lots of other folks eat here too, LOL.  Just stating that they have a diverse clientele.

The restaurant looks a little tired these days but is still acceptable; could use a little 'refreshing'.  

The location is a little bit rough but nothing to be worried about during the day; at night you should just be careful.  If you are knowledgeable about the area you know what I mean."}
{"text":"This place was very good.  I went here after getting referred to it by a client. The parking lot was full at lunch so I assumed there would be a big wait but there was no wait at all. The interiors are very well decorated. Our food was brought out very quickly and everything was quite tasty."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was 8years old and love the food. It is not like I remember though, the out side area was a lot more green with trees. I recommend the pollo fundio or the #1 combo plates both are amazing"}
{"text":"What more can you ask for? Garcia's is cheap, delicious and home to incredible, freshly made horchata and chimichangas. Absolutely worth it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is for the Garcias To Go....  I just went in on Xmas Eve @ 6pm.  I ordered 2 bags and 2 -1/2 pints of hot sauce.  There was a reason for me ordering 2-1/2 pints and they gave me it to me in 1 PT.  I told the girl that I needed it in 2 containers and she said well you should of ordered it that way.  To respond to that I said I did order 2 - 1/2 pints for a reason.  The girl got two plastic containers but her demeaner was rude and nasty.  I told her just put the containers in the bag I'll do it at home.  Then she had the nerve to yell to the cashier and ask what did I order.  This Food Clerk obviously doesn't know the meaning of Customer Service.  I have never done a bad review before so this should explain how upset I was over how I was talked too."}
{"text":"When I first came to town in 93 the Realtor showing me commercial rentals took me here for lunch.  And I got a bit of a history lesson of Southwest Phoenix.  I got part of the story about Garcia's becoming a chain and being sold and this one location being bought back.  As he used to own a home where Maryvale High School is I also got a history lesson on John F. Long (whom I later met as a customer) and the build up of the Maryvale neighborhood just to the West of here.

I enjoyed that meal.  Since then I have taken business acquaintances, relatives, dates and friends here.  I have yet to have anyone complain.  It's not so spicy as to turn people off.  The thin chips are always served warm.  They used to serve two salsas, now they only serve the mild except on request.  The food is consistent every time.  The only thing I have ever had I wasn't enamored with was the margarita I once had.  The service is always great except it is consistently hard to get the bill.  They can handle several 10-20 party groups at a time.  During dinner hours they quite often have strolling musicians.

This last time I stopped in for lunch and got the chimichunga lunch special for $8.00 which came with rice and beans and chips and salsa.  I was stuffed.  The food came quickly and was just as I expected.  When I got there about 11:15 there were still plenty of parking spaces, by the time I left at 12:00 the parking lot was packed.

I don't hardly ever give 5 stars and I am pretty sure I wouldn't on a one time visit here but how else can you rate a place you are willing to drive from wherever in the Valley for and not be worried about whether anybody with you will like it."}
{"text":"The original Garcia's is fantastic. Home style Mexican food with flavor. Not one of franchise Garcia's restaurants."}
{"text":"Being new to the Phoenix area, we rely on Yelp!!  
In searching for a good Mexican restaurant last night, we stumbled across  The Original Garcia's. . Oh my good ness, it was amazing!!  The salsa was just the right spice level!!  We also enjoyed the spinach  Queso dip(yummy). The strawberry margaritas were some of the best I have ever had. I had the shrimp fajitas for my entree which  were very flavorful.  I don't remember what my husband ordered, but it was steak with jalapeños ,green peppers in a brown sauce. He ate every last bite!!
Our servers name was Faustina, she was very very good, very attentive . We will for sure be going back!!! I would of given 5 stars, but someone told me once that the 5 star ratings get filtered out."}
{"text":"I love this place. Whenever I want good mexican food and am around this side of town we always go there. I have been going there since I was a kid and not a lot has changed....but why change a good thing?"}
{"text":"So I am moving to D.C. in couple weeks so I had a bucket list of all of these types of food to have out or/and make at home. One of them was to have authentic Mexican food that you cannot get anywhere, particularly D.C. So we did a lot of research because all of the places we used to go to when I was a kid are either out of business or just not good anymore. We saw that this place had great reviews and people have recommended to us that we try this place out. 

We came here on a Friday night around 6:40. We only had to wait 10 minutes which is awesome. We decided to get a margarita and couple beers while we waited. The minute we got our drinks, our table was ready. My mom said she wanted a glass for her beer since she had a lime in her bottle, but it took them 10 minutes to get her a glass for the beer. It still did not kill my rating of this place because the meal itself made up for it. Even though there was a long delay like 35 minutes from the kitchen from when we had the most delicious cheese crisp to our dinner. We savored every bite of our meal. The tamales, especially the green corn tamale was outstanding, beef tacos were out of the world, chicken enchilada was hot and steamy, beans were full of flavor and reminded me of my old childhood days.

The only con from this was the service and the bathroom. The bathroom strangely was really messy in terms of toilet paper and paper towels all over so I'd recommend that getting cleaned more often so people dont walk out with things on the bottom of their feet!"}
{"text":"I had not been in a couple of years and was happy to come back.  The service is still excellent as I remember.  I knocked off a star because my taco meat was not very warm."}
{"text":"Usually this place is a pleasant place to eat. Unfortunately, be WARNED! Online it said they were open. But it is 7:50pm on a Wednesday and they were closed. I went inside, in case the sign was mistakenly turned to \"Closed\". Nope, the hostess explained that it cost more for them to be open when it's \"slow\" than not. So they closed early and turned me away. I found that very interesting considering there were people at the bar and more vehicles in parking lot. It didn't seem \"dead\" or \"slow.\" Kinda pissed me off. I think I'll take a break from this restaurant. So, one peace of advise is to call ahead to insure they are open. Wish I did that instead of taking the time to go there I person."}
{"text":"We stopped by after my son's football game just down the street.  We came with a party of 45 people but they were all smaller parties.  We found spots in the bar area with everyone sitting at separate tables.  The host came over and told us that they don't serve food in the bar because they were not staffed to do that today.  We explained that we were all separated and didn't need to be treated as a single party.  They continued to tell us they wouldn't serve us because it wasn't possible.  We looked around and other groups were being served at the bar so we couldn't understand.  They finally decided to move us into their dinning area after half of our party left.  We walked back by the bar to use the restroom and find other people have sat in the bar and are being served in the exact tables that we were sitting in.  Their service is absolutely horrible! Do not come here unless you want to be treated like crap for no reason.  Turning away that many people can't be good for business!"}
{"text":"Absolute WORST restaurant experience in my lifetime! A friend held her rehearsal dinner in a large room at this location. The event was completely understaffed. I spent years working in restaurants, and I couldn't believe the lack of preparedness and handling of the event. There weren't servers specifically assigned to the room, and getting service in the room was difficult! It took more than 30 minutes to get a Pepsi, and it took an hour and a half to get food for the room. The servers in our room were also serving in the main dining room, so they were hardly around. Our party was about 70 people! An event like that should have people assigned to the banquet room attending to the party. What horrible management. I had to go get my own high chair (after waiting 30 minutes). I had to go beg for my toddler's food. She was the last one they served in the room--it was 9:00!!!  I had to go track down kids menus for whole room because no one brought us any. There weren't enough adult menus in our room either. We had to pass them around and share. Seriously, it's like the establishment forgot we were coming. When I tried to order my food off the menu, the server told me that I shouldn't order it. I ended up ordering enchiladas. They were gross. The food was bland and the texture was stiff. I had to cut my enchiladas with a knife. Perhaps they were overcooked. My husband and I love Mexican food, and he hated his food too. At the different times of the night when I was walking around trying to get things like menus and high chairs, a couple people asked me if I was the manager! HA! I'm guessing there wasn't a manager in the whole place. When I was trying to resolve the toddler food issue, I went up to the hostess to ask for help since our servers were nowhere. She seemed about 15 and wondered around like she didn't know what was going on. She never came back. Finally, a friend from the party came to tell me the toddler food had been delivered. My night was so miserable. My toddler sobbed the whole way home, and I was pretty close myself. I would never ever recommend to my worst enemy to host an event at this horrible place--and I wouldn't recommend going to dinner here either since the food and service were terrible. I sat with an empty drink for most of the night also, since they never offered to refill my Pepsi (that took 30 minutes to receive in the first place). So perhaps this would be a good restaurant for you if you are fasting or anorexic. It was a nightmare for a family who actually wanted to eat good food at a reasonable hour! My friend kept apologizing (and I was horrified that she even noticed there was a problem). She should have had a perfect night, and I'm sure many other restaurants could have delivered a much better experience."}
{"text":"What once was the best Mexican food in Phoenix, has now dropped to a level of a chain of fast food. I come here monthly on business and have tried to bring my customers and co workers here as often as possible. It truly was good authentic food that had the freshness and flavor that made it a great experience. 
I came here on Monday with 3 others and left with a huge void. I deserved it though as the quality here has steadily declined over the past year so I deserved what I got. 

The reception was horrible even though we were one of only three people in the lobby.  The hostess had wandered off right when we walked in and had to wait for 5 minutes before we saw anybody. 

The Mexican pizza we ordered came out not even close to being hot and lacked any flavor. It was so bad we had them throw the rest away. 

When the main courses came out, even though I had brought it to their attention, the food was so cold we couldn't eat it. Not real happy to send food back after one complaint, we had them wrap up the rest and took it home to the good old microwave. 

Besides the temperature, the quality was just not there, even the salsa lacked any punch even after i asked for the hotter version.  

Too many places to spend my hard earned money to pay that much for the experience we had on Monday."}
{"text":"Attended a dinner party here and good such good customer service, the workers there kept coming back and forth making sure our table needed any refills or anything in general. The food was excellent and so was the environment. I would defiantly go back and try more of their amazing plates. !!!!!!! MORE THAN HAPPY"}
{"text":"Service was mediocre at best. Sat in the bar at a high top and throughout our stay for drinks, was less than thrilled with our mediocre service from Leah. We were there for an extended amount of time and while I try to give the server/ bartender the benefit of the doubt because I too am in the service industry, she flat out sucked. We will not be back. It's a shame. Don't waste your time or money."}

{"text":"Good food and huge portions.  The service was great."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated. Salsa is not good, neither the regular or their \"spicy\" version. Typical Americanized Mexican food, nothing special. I can see the appeal with the decor; it does look nice. But I would rather eat in a hole in the wall spot w/ tasty food. We asked our waitress (who was Hispanic) if she liked the food there. She replied that it was gringo food and she had to improvise w/ extra ingredients to make it more appetizing, which we completely agreed with. 95% of the patrons were white.  You can typically judge an ethnic food place if the people of that ethnicity regularly eat there. Well I wanted to try this \"famous\" establishment since so many people rave about it. It did not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Hmmmm... I wrote a review of this restaurant and now I don't see it, I'm wondering why?

The place is good, old-school Mexican food.  Prices are what you'd expect, they're not giving anything away, it's fine. 

But these folks confuse \"old-school\" with a \"don't give a sh*t\", we'll do it MY way!\"   * They say they close at 9 weekdays, 10 Fri Sat: do not believe them. They close whenever they damn well feel like it. 

* last week, after spending almost $8 on guacamole, I bit down on the external avocado seed, you know, not the pit, the \"seed\" at the top of the avocado...the one that is removed by ANY COMPETENT COOK?  \"F-it!\" They say. \"We're 'old-school', we can what we want!\"

* some personnel are there to accept your money. Nothing more. Woman bartender is AWFUL. No service, no help, lots of makeup and attitude. I won't subject myself to her again. 

This place is SO SPOTTY that I bgo there once a month, at best. If they actually had any professionalism I might go there once a week. You go there at your own risk, and at your own risk stay away from that bartenderess AND any other restaurant in the neighborhood. They're worse: (see: Los Portales!)

03/15//2018- my last time I go to this dump,  I swear. 

Again, this joint shows the big difference between \"mom-and-pop\" and just unprofessional. They close when they want and seem to take pleasure in informing you they're closed. See photo attached says they're open until 10pm. They'll be closed by 9:15 minimum. 

The bartenders just act unilaterally (and trust me: there isn't a bartender there that could define unilateral.) Female bartenders live to fool with their hair and then fruit garnish the drinks. Ugh. 

I keep thinking 1 meal 5 years ago will magically reappear. It hasn't and it won't. Good riddance."}

When we questioned it we were told that the way you tell the red from the green is you see green specks in the red sauce. HELLO! I was born and raised here and green chili sauce is not red.  We were told the entire kitchen staff had been replaced recently. Compared to what we had at this location, we would have been better off going to Taco Bell.  I spoke with the manager, and she didn't seem concerned."}

{"text":"Very tasty and well priced for Mexican food! I had the combination appetizer which came with tamales, beef tacos, taquitos, chimi's with a side of beans. The tamales tasted deliciously with the spicy salsa which is the perfect mix of chunky and spice. I wasn't very fond of the tacos and taquitos but the chimi's and tamales made up for it. This will definitely be my 1st choice when it comes to Mexican food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was very excited to take me to the original Garcia's since he has been going there for years. He ordered a green and red enchilada's and the green was quite tasty. I ordered an crispy taco and burro. The taco was pretty good but the burro, rice, and beans all left me disappointed. I am told that the express take-away section of the restaurant in the parking lot offers better food, which is strange for me. The table next to us returned their food for being cold and the service took forever inside. We won't be back"}
{"text":"6/12/18 today is my birthday and had no intentions on going to dinner as we have plans tomorrow, anyways my husband didn't want me cooking so we came here. Haven't really been back in awhile because it was more miss than hit. Anyways Aaliyah was our waitress and she was great, she was friendly and attentive. Our food came fast and hot, I had the pollo ranchero, never had that before it was pretty delicious... up until I pulled a rubber band out of my mouth from the bite I had just taken I was so disappointed. Aaliyah right away offered to remake it which I had declined but she insisted and said we can box it up for you. I said ok hey tomorrow lunch at work, they also sang Happy Birthday to me which was sweet and embarrassing hahahaha. There was a young man I believe a busser I didn't catch his name but he kept checking in on us as well which was nice. Aaliyah had taken my plate and rubber band to her manager when she brought our bill the dish was taken off the total which was cool considering I didn't expect it since they remade my plate. I have to say even though there was a negative to this visit Aaliyah went above and beyond to make it a positive. She was a great waitress!!! Good job also to the busboy I wish I had caught his name but he was a younger guy with a friendly and helpful personality."}
{"text":"Had lunch today,  service was excellent & food was phenomenal.  Definitely will be going back very soon.  Apple Chimi dessert is a must try, it was a great ending to a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Finally found fantastic Mexican food in Phoenix! I crave the red burro and tamale's daily now!   TAbsolutely delicious!  If I could live here I would be fat & happy! :)"}
{"text":"The pros: great looking place, feels like you aren't in Phoenix. Family rags-to-riches story is a great plus. 

The cons: inattentive waiter. Waited 20 minutes to be even greeted by a waiter, had to grab the support staff to flag someone down. When he finally showed up, he was underwhelming in service. Saw him three times the whole evening, and he left part of the order in the kitchen, we had to flag someone down to get the rest of it. Abondigas soup was lukewarm at best (been eating this here for years.) The food steadily has taken a dive over the past few years. Doesn't live up to the standards I've come to expect from the original restaurant. 

Really disappointed. Don't plan to visit again in the future."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix traveling for work and a local colleague recommended we get lunch at Garcia's.  I'm a fan of chili rellenos so that's what I ordered - Holy moly amazingly delicious! Very well executed

Knowing I wouldn't have much time for lunch the next day before heading to the airport, I ordered a relleno from their take-out counter instead. It was equally as delicious. No disappointments"}
{"text":"My Granny chose this place for her birthday dinner. We had a large party, so it wasn't surprising that there was a wait. What was surprising was that two other large parties that came in after us were seated first. We'd already been told they weren't accepting reservations, so it obviously wasn't that. Strike one. When we were finally seated several of the older member of our party stated that it was very warm in our area. My uncle noticed that the fan near our table was moving in the wrong direction, pulling air up instead of pushing it down, and asked for it to be fixed. We were told a management would come over to help. No one ever did, so he fixed it himself. Then we had to deal with a server who didn't really seem all that inclined to actually serve. He had such a condescending attitude, if it were up to me I'd have left after his first sly comment. Out of a table of twelve, none of us got food that was any good. My margarita was obviously? a pre-mix, the beans were canned, and the shrimp in my tacos was overcooked. My aunt's chimichanga was soggy and my grandmother's was so crunchy she couldn't eat it, then the server argued with them when they asked for them to be redone. They brought the food out separately, so that some people were nearly done eating while others were just starting. The service was stunningly bad and the food wasn't nearly good enough to make it worth it. It was an overwhelmingly unsatisfactory experience and I wouldn't eat there again if they paid me."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but pretty damn close. DEFINITELY the best decor of ANY Mexican place I've ever eaten at, and that's a lot of places. Minus one star as our waiter was on the slow side and not very attentive, especially considering it was not that busy. 

Great spot...I will return."}
{"text":"We had to wait almost an hour due to the kitchen being backed up on washing dishes..how stupid!! Also their silverware is filmsy like dollar store quality. On the positive side the food is tasty and portion size is HUGE!!!!!!!!! Try their nachos but only order medium size if you have 4-6 people!!!"}
{"text":"Wow - I come here at least once a month and usually order a pollo fundido but last night I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were AMAZING!! I will totally order them again!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately our waiter never seems like he's very happy to be there. We have had him before. The Pina Colada was good the dinner was so so."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited 20 minutes to never be served with the exception of chips and salsa. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Being a native of Phoenix, I buy/cook mexican food at least once or twice week. This Saturday after a movie at the Esplanade, I drove into the Garcias drive-thru to get some early dinner. I always order a green burro, enchilada style with rice and beans.The wait was very reasonable compared to other take-out wait times. I felt like $8.89 was a bit more than what I usually pay, but no real complaint there either. 

The food was piping hot and delicious. I wish I would have specified green enchilada sauce but the red sauce was very good. I can tell the reheat is going to HIT later on (excited). 

I don't have anything bad to say about this place as it was recommended to me by one of my coworkers. I am from South Phoenix, so my favorites are Carolinas and Ritos, and sometimes Ponchos (on central). I am not familiar with any Westside mexican food so I'm so happy I get to add the OG Garcias to the list."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican  eateries in Phoenix. I LOVE the decor and furniture. The service is good, the menu affordable and the food isn't at all bad. Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp with my phone as I drive into AZ and I am glad it was this place. The food was great and the service was friendly. As for recommendations because it was my first time and the enchilada combo  was great. Best of all they gave me a free taco to try because it was my first time and also it was 10 mins before they close. The taco was also very good. I finish everything in less then 10 mins. Will stop by again next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Sadly the food looks bomb don't get me wrong but me and my husbands plate were flavorless I don't know like they either needed salt or simply the spices they add was either a lot or a little bit . I was disappointed because I was really looking forward to eating good."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite places but several times they have decided to close by 7:00PM with a full parking lot and several groups walking up only to be turned away. It's become so frequent that they stopped posting when they close. If you're making plans... make them elsewhere cuz you never know if they will be open."}
{"text":"We were recently in Scottsdale on business and stayed at LaQuinta nearby and had dinner at Garcia's. It is within walking distance of the hotel. It was just delicious in all respects. Both nights (different wait staff) we had great service and delicious meals. Everything was fresh and nicely presented too.  The place was lively with dates, couples, families, seniors. Nice mix. We had the enchiladas one night and tamales and tacos another.  Beer and house margs. Would go out of the way next time we are in Scottsdale just to eat here again.  Great job in all respects!"}
{"text":"Came here since this is a place that my girlfriend's Mother and Sister regular and had some high hopes.  Enjoyed some queso and and spinach dip and chips, along with some margaritas while waiting for our food.  We had ordered the pollo fundido and the tacos steak, as well as a side of green chile.  High hopes and in for a treat - we thought.

Then the food comes out and three bites on my girlfriend finds a cricket in her lettuce/avocado while I'm chewing on a bone from my fundido.  What?!?!  We pack up our daughter and ask for a manager, and the manager loads up our plates with quite the lack of empathy after 1-2 bites per plate and continues on to let us know we would be charged for the margaritas.  Lmao......amazing.  Had to take a pic after that nonsense......

Based on some of the other reviews (more recently) on cleanliness - it kinda makes sense.  Proceed with caution.  Very surprised the table next to us (who hadn't had any food yet) knew what just happened and stayed with they're three kids - just crazy."}
{"text":"Need hotter sauce, but otherwise can't complain! Came here with my parents for my first time in Phoenix. It was mid-afternoon, not to crowded, and we were seated quickly. The waitress was very amiable and took our orders with ease. everything came out quickly, and it was all delicious! I got a chimichanga, and my parents both ordered burritos. Would definitely recommend and plan to return!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for fried ice cream - the taste was akin to a McDonald's strawberry sundae with soggy corn flakes on top - not fried ice cream not worth you time, calories or the drive.  Service was terrible in the bar - waitress was unhelpful, disappeared for a while and I had to chase her down to actually pay my tab.  We were completely unimpressed and will not be back - don't waste your time on this subpar place!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Garcias on several occassions, and each time the quality and service gets worse and worse. 

In general, they serve \"cheap\", large-portioned, Americanized versions of  Mexican food that are swimming in a pool of oil from the loads of cheese and fryer oil that has been dumped on. If not oil, then everything else is wet from a sauce of some kind from being added on (e.g, enchilada red sauce).

We visited on 9/26/14 at 7 pm with a group of 12 who had made prior reservations. We were seated in the furthest most corner, next to a group of 40, and a second group of more than 20. The noise level was deafening. We were given one glass of water each, two baskets of chips for the tables, and were made to share salsa out of a 2 oz plastic condiment cup for each 2 people. 

Twice we had asked to put in a drink order for margaritas and daquaris. The first time the waitress forgot, and the second time, the waitress got the orders mixed up. The bussers were not able to take drink orders because they were under 18 and could not handle alcohol. 

After the hour, we had our water glasses refilled for what would be the only time of the evening, and then our orders were taken. Fourty minutes later, the staff dumped the food on the table, then quickly left. The chicken enchilada was served as a beef enchilada, which had a strange texture to it, and the cheese enchilada was served as a chicken enchilada. 


Excuse after excuse was made for the slow service. \"It was a slow night so we sent staff home early\", which makes absolutely no sense, unless a group of 40 shows up with no prior notice..and then followed by a group of 20. This restaurant was well aware of their capacity levels and are not able to service all the seats they have inside.

When the checks finally came, we had to wait 20 minutes before they were paid, because no one would pick them up. I had to get up and flag down the manager Gloria, who gave the same lame excuses  - although she made no apologies or attempt to make up for any inconvenience we had. My complaints were quickly shrugged off, and I could feel her uncaring attitude and desire to just have us pay and leave.

These people treat their customers like this because they can -- they serve low-quality food in bulk to people who have no expectation of service. If someone does complain, they can make up for it in quantity with other guests coming in. 

I would suggest you save yourself the headache, and go for somewhere more authentic --- like a Filibertos. 

This place is just down right horrid. Stay away."}
{"text":"As good as it gets. My family and I have been coming here for over 20 years, and will still be coming here for years to come. This restaurant sets itself off from the \"chain\". Thank god it's not owned by the chain. The food here is true to hispanic culture, and very delicious. The service is fantastic, and friendly.  However, the servers need to step it up a notch and get the food out faster. Will always be a fan."}
{"text":"My favorite place for mexican food. Good food, good prices, and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I have patronized Garcia's since 1962 when it was located at 35th Ave. and McDowell.  In 2001 my wife and I moved to Marshfield, MO and we still drive back to Phoenix at least once a year to eat at Garcia's.  This is my favorite eatery in the United States.  We now live in the mid-west and I haven't found decent Mexican Food since we left Phoenix.  I judge every Mexican Restaurant I eat at by this one.  

I particularly like the combination appetizers and I really like the Green Tamale... oh yeah... and the Chimi's and... oh hell, I like it all.  The food is great, the service is good and the atmosphere is pleasant.  The chips keep coming and the salsa is delicious.  Olivia has created an icon."}
{"text":"Not sure if anyone remembers that this was the first Garcia's. This is the real deal. Been coming here since I was a kid. But Yelp wasn't around back then. Lol"}
{"text":"So my family and i came here for my sisters birthday. Walking in, the atmosphere is pretty cool and the first thing you see is the bar. Pretty well stocked. I might come back for a drink only. 
We were seated quickly. Especially for a party of 10 Total. Once we were seated it did take about 10 mins for a waiter to become available. I ordered the #6 dinner combo of 2 cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and a coffee.
The food took quite some time to come out but it was tasty and was a large serving of food. The price matched the dish which was a plus. 
For desert, we brought a cake that the restaurant was nice enough to place in their refrigerator. However, once the cake was brought out we were not provided plates or silverware (since our main course was through we no longer had silverware). We had to get up and ask for plates forks, etc.
Overall it's a nice place but the service can really use some work."}
{"text":"Garcia's, oh how the years have ruined you. You USED to be the BEST Mexican food on Earth!!! I have been eating at this Original Garcia's for close to 50 years, since they first opened their doors on 35th Avenue south of McDowell in a tiny restaurant in a tiny strip mall next to a grocery store strip mall. Even when I moved away a few decades ago, I went out of my way to get my Garcia's Las Avenidas fix!! And I did so for over two decades. But the last few years they have just gone downhill... It is kind of similar but just NOT THE SAME!!! In fact, it is not good enough for me to return after my last few disappointing experiences. 

I went with my ex-mother in law, one of my best friends, and other family members who have eated the Original Garcia's for decades. First of all, it was 3:00 in the afternoon on a weekday (no one there) and we were seated right next to the kitchen!! Talk about the worst spot in the house with no ambience!! What the hell??? We requested to be moved. 

We all agreed that Garcia's has lost its touch. Such a shame!! I used to go to school with the Garcia kids, Jimmy specifically among others, and we used to appreciate the love and pride that made Garcia's the BEST place on Earth!! 

Well, fast forward to today and I promise that I won't ever be back!! I used to order EXTRA food for leftovers and this time not only did I not order extra food, I didn't eat what was on my plate and I'm not interested in eating my leftovers. I am so sad to leave with just lifelong memories knowing I will never return...

Garcia's:  Message me if you decide to step it up and make the Original Garcia family proud!! I might give you another try for old time's sake."}
{"text":"They call themselves the Original because they have nothing to do with the gross-o chain Garcias.  
It's so good.  I work in the southwest valley, so I have endless choices for Mexican food.  This is the only Mexican restaurant I'll eat at in my area.  In fact, whenever the boss man comes out to work with me, it's the only place he'll eat at too. 
He eats healthy and I do too, well on weekdays.  There are a few options on the menu that won't weigh you down the rest of the day.  Dishes with fish, black beans, chicken breasts, spinach, etc, made with delicious Mexican flavors.  Ofcourse there are the weigh downs as well.  Looove the chimichanga.  
It's huge and cozy inside and don't let the area scare you.  It's on the main road and you're safe if you're there during operating hours."}
{"text":"The nachos are huge! With delicious beans and real cheese. Salsa is good as well. Gilles chicken is also tasty."}
{"text":"average food and service in my opinion.  I eat mexican food regularly, in So Calif. and this is not exceptional."}
{"text":"I had the fajita quesadilla and it was not very good.  I had it with grilled onions and peppers that were burnt.  My quesadilla looked like it was poorly thrown together with leftovers.  My colleagues meals looked good, but mine was not great.  The service wasn't good.  When we sat down a girl dropped off chips and salsa, and didn't ask if we wanted drinks.  We didn't get our drink orders in until we ordered food."}
{"text":"Before today, the very last time I came here was in 2008. I went with my best friend when school was over at Carl Hayden High School which is just down the street. I wasn't very pleased. An item we ordered was forgotten, the lady gave us the bill RIGHT after she gave us our food which I thought was quite tacky since I want to stuff my face first, then see the bill and pay. The food wasn't very hot and fresh. Decided I was to take my business elsewhere and Arriba Mexican Grill became our new go to place for a long time until they started serving food that was borderline frozen and hiring people who don't care. Well, for my Mom's birthday today she decided she wanted to go to this location. I have to say I was quite pleased with the food and service. I ordered the #2 dinner special which is a beef enchilada, beef taco, a tostada and beans and rice. It was so hot and delicious. Portions were very generous. Our server/waitress Christy was very nice and made sure we were all taken care of. Unlike the Garcia's that is somewhere near Metro Center, this place actually cranks up the air conditioning to ensure comport from the hot weather. I can say we are definable going to come back soon. I was very pleased."}
{"text":"Not as great as expected, moderate service. What threw us really off, is when the check came with a wrong charge on it and we pointed it out to the waitress, she already knew it was on there, but gave us the wrong check anyway?"}
{"text":"For the reader, please be aware that there are the \"corporate\" Garcia's which is BLAH!, and then there's this place, The Original Garcia's, which is AWESOME!

I've been coming to this place almost 25 years, and I've tried most of the items on the menu over the years.  I've never had a bad meal, and in fact I use the original Garcia's as my gold standard for other Mexican food. 

This place has both the main restaurant, and a separate  take out/drive thru/sit down building.  If you want a more formal setting, go tot he main restaurant, but if you want a quick sit down place, or get the food to go, you have that option.  Personally, I go through the take out most of the time, because its all the same food, which is all the same level of AWESOME!   

Go there, and your tummy will thank you for it!"}
{"text":"We loved it! The food was delicious,the service was wonderful,very patient waiter.Next time we will ask to be seated away from a large family party,so that room was very loud,but that was something we should have asked for in the beginning. I cannot wait to eat there again.Oh yeah,the portions are so big,we split meals.Good thing,there are 7 of us,so it turned out to be reasonably priced. Loved the feel of Mexico there."}
{"text":"Traditional Mexican food.. very large menu with lots of choice. They offer a lunch menu 11-4."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Fresh chips and salsa (ask for the hot, too!). I had the Taco Steak, which is basically grilled carne asada and onions served with rice, beans, and guacamole - and your choice of tortillas (I recommend the corn). It was delicious."}
{"text":"I have to agree with previous reviews,  this place has really gone down hill both in terms of service and food quality over the last several years.   

My two most recent outings have caused me to say \"never again\" to this place. 

Let's start with the last time I visited.  Being a Sunday I order a bowl of red menudo.  Server says \"sorry, we ran out\"  after another look at the menu I order Pollo fundido which is basically a deep fried chicken burrito topped with jalapeño cream cheese.   The burro was fried beyond recognition and cold!   Just as I was finishing my rice, beans & the few bites I could tolerate of the Pollo fundido a party sits at the table next to mine & the gentleman orders a bowl of red menudo which the server promptly delivered!   

Next visit, again on a weekend so I order a bowl of red menudo.   Server says \"I'm sorry ma'am we ran out\"  I relay my experience from my last visit & ask him to check.   He says \"ma'am I already know we're out\" so I order a combination plate of bean tostada and chicken enchilada.  The tostada was good but the enchilada was bland.  To top it off, as I was leaving I saw a server delivering, you got it, a bowl of red menudo to another patron.

Good bye Garcias!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times in the past decade. This time around, the food and the service was horrible. The food was cold, the waitress was clueless. Very disappointed with our visit this time."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is not life-changing Mexican food. It isn't the most authentic either, but it is tasty and it will fill a craving. They have the best chips. They are always warm, and thin, and just the right amount of salty. The salsa is okay.

I like ordering the taco steak which is chopped steak with cheese and it comes with tortillas, rice, and beans. I also like ordering the combination appetizer because you get to taste a little bit of everything. It includes 2 mini flautas, 2 mini chimis, a mini bean and cheese tostada, a tamale, and 2 mini beef tacos, all for around $10.

The restaurant is beautiful and festive. Sometimes I like to order ahead and pick up in the take out building. Like I said, it's not the best I've ever had, but I do crave those chips like nobody's business."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, there lived a happily married couple, young and in love, Julio and Olivia Garcia.  While they were happy and successful, Olivia decided she wanted to go out on a limb and open a restaurant. Julio supported her of course as did other members of the family.  This grew from barely more than a taco stand, to having several large locations around the valley.  They finally grew so large, a member of the family could no longer be at each location ensuring it was being run to their standards, so they sold the business to a franchise chain.  But Julio and Olivia were far from done.  They wanted to go back to what had made them so successful in the beginning, so they created The Original Garcia's Las Avenidas.  

The above is a Readers Digest version of the story on-line.  It was important to open with that because this is NOT another Garcia's restaurant.  This is how they started - what made them successful.  And SO much more.  

There are 2 buildings.  One large building that houses the restaurant and (my favorite part) an \"Express\" restaurant that makes a limited menu, but all the basics, that are available through DRIVE THOUGH!  Oh yea.  Drive through.  It's amazing!  Or you can park and walk into the small waiting area.  Either way.  

But the main restaurant is SO amazing.  It's like you are going to a nice restaurant in Mexico.  Plants, flowers, fountains, tons of saltillo tile, cool art.  And all sorts of fun little nooks to sit.

And did I mention it's less expensive than the chain?  Oh yea.  You're getting Original level Garcia's food, overseen by Garcia's family members in an amazing location, and it will actually cost you less.  It's really amazing.  And did I mention we've always had great service?  Even with a large party  (and some of those people who never know what they want) everything was polite and managed as smoothly as if we'd been a party of 4.

It's such a fun place.  I'm sure you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Most of the servers and host staff is great. During lunch I have experienced issues with the hostess calling us even after we told her we would sit in the part. She seemed confused. Also the bar is very cramped for space."}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant VERY much. This is where I watched USC beat ASU for the Pac 10 championship of 2009!  And with ASU fans in the house!

They have a DAILY happy hour!!  Draft Bud Lights are like 2 freakin dollars! And all their appetizers (nachos, jalapeno poppers, etc) are all half-off. We got the nachos, and BOY were they loaded!!!  Ground beef, cheese, jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream, tomatoes... mmmm!!  

So we were like 3 of 5 people who were there on a Saturday afternoon at 3 p.m. but around 5ish more people started filling in. They also have this live band set-up but they weren't on when we were there. 

So it's a great spot to be to watch a game (oh they also have soccer via satellite) and have a couple beers."}
{"text":"Bar environment and staff are great, but the food is not. If you just want generic food and a good bar it's a good place to go."}
{"text":"The food at this Garcia is great. The service and staff are wonderful also. In my opinion this Garcia is far better than the one on Peoria, well worth the drive for sure."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the most authentic Mexican cuisine I have had in a long time.  This Garcias is kind of in a ghetto area, so if you drive a BMW like myself, I would do a quick take out and leave the area.  I went in my friend's pickup truck, so we were safe from damage.  Regardless of the location, I felt very warming inside the restaurant.  I feel a very old pueblo atmosphere inside the restaurant.  The waitress explained the slow meat cooking preparation process of some of their dishes, and explanations made my mouth water.  I make a lot of determination of Mexican restaurants by the flavor and spice level of the salsa, and its to die for!  I got chicken enchiladas and my friend got a red chili burro.  To complement my meal, I had a strawberry daquiri-like margarita.  I felt like I was in heaven!"}
{"text":"This place is really good and tastes better than the Garcias chain restaurants. My department comes here to eat every year after we volunteer at St. Mary's food bank and this place has great service, they're fast at bringing out the food, everything is pretty tasty and overall a good Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for our anniversary expecting good food and  customer service based on reviews.  Although we were greeted and seated right away, once we sat at our table, chips and salsa were delivered.  Our server walks up and asks if we were ready to order; we just sat down. We asked for a couple minutes. Approximately 8 minutes later she comes back abd takes our order. So as we ate, were deciding on dessert when the bill is handed over to us what kind of customer service is that!? I have been a server since I was 16. The server never introduced herself checked on us twice and didn't bother to ask about dessert. She just assumed we were done. I dislike servers like that very much. I think this will be our last time eating here."}
{"text":"I am just not a fan. One time we ordered food for a staff party and many staff members got sick. I have eaten here several times before over the years and before Yelping became standard and once again last week for our, \"last day of school eat out tradition.\"  While I can't say anything bad about the service the food is just not very good. I do have to say the Gaucamole I ordered was really nasty.

I know, I know I am picky about Mexican food but I wanted to eat with my \"Peeps.\" However, I will probably not eat here ever again. 

Another thing that keeps going around in my mind is that I worked at a Garcia's when I first graduated college and I was treated very poorly."}
{"text":"Been eating here before they expanded into this huge restaurant with a separate take out drive thru.

Chips and salsa are always great and plentiful but don't eat too much before your meal arrives. 

One of my favorites are the Pollo Fundido which are square shaped deep fried chicken chimichangas with a jalapeño sour cream on top.

The machaca chimichangas wet or dry with guacamole are awesome and prepared to perfection. 

During the week day for lunch it is always packed and difficult to find a parking space but they get you in and out quickly. 

We just went on a Saturday and found plenty of parking however the service was very slow and they seemed to be under staffed which was surprised and disappointing. 

I don't know how many times I have been here and this was the first time the service was this way.

Regardless will certainly be back. Keep in mind this is the original Garcias and not the chain."}
{"text":"Service was slow.  Tortillas for the carne asada tacos smelled \"odd\". Kind of like feet.  Carne was dry and in eventful"}
