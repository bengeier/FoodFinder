{"text":"I don't know how this place got four stars but I am very not impressed.  The bathrooms are nasty and riddled with gang graffiti.  I cannot imagine how the health department has not closed it down."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a staple in the community. The food is delicious and the staff is attentive to our needs. I've also had them cater an event and the portions are GREAT for the price. Also, they are concerned about quality over quantity in their buffet, which means a lot."}
{"text":"Love this place best Chinese evr lol I guess it's not for everyone though the wife dnt seem to care for it it's not ur average Chinese buffet the ginger wings are the best and are my favorite great value for the 8$ and some change that u pay for it"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place. I don't get it. It's one-dimensional, overcooked, and just blah. Two stars because they don't overcharge, but really, if the price was one measley dollar more, I'd give it only one star, as that is what the food, dining area, and restrooms merit. 

There are few selections, and really, everything tastes the same. ALL the sauces are cloyingly sweet, and ONLY sweet. There are no subtle flavors like good Chinese food offers. The ONLY dish with vegetables was the beef with broccoli. (Sure, there were a few shards of carrot and celery in the lo mein, but really, there were no vegetables in any of the other dishes.) Two choices of soup, fried rice only.

The fried zucchini and the onion rings were both soggy messes. (Umm, tell the cook to not overcrowd the pan. He's reducing the temperature of the oil by overcrowding the pan, with the result being mushy batter instead of crispy.) The salad is iceburg lettuce and slices of underripe tomatoes. The desert choices are soft serve ice cream and red Jell-O. 

Oh, use the restroom somewhere else. No seat covers, tons of grafitti, mirrors so scratched up that you can't see yourself. The man behind the counter who took my credit card was super-friendly, but the waitress who brought my water didn't utter one word, nor even offer a smile. 

You know, if you are happy with Americanized slop that is overcooked (DRY, bone dry!), with no ambience whatsoever, then hey, give this place a try, but it sure didn't turn out to be my cup o' tea."}
{"text":"Its a family tradition, I've been coming here since I was little and the tradtion continues. You know just what to expect and the food has always tasted the same. Avoid the restrooms the place is really old :)"}
{"text":"Was in the area and decide to try this place.  This is an okay place, the food was nothing to write home about.  It is a decent Chinese buffet place.  I am not sure I would go back if I was in the area on my own.  Might go if there is someone else wanted to go.."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese buffet.  Yes, maybe the selection is a little smaller than most but I'm only interested in the orange chicken, sesame chicken, and beef & broccoli anyway, and they're excellent.  The sesame chicken is to die for!  It's not a fancy type place but it's clean with great food, decent prices, and friendly people."}
{"text":"The price is really great. The buffet does not have much of a selection but the things that are there are good. Overall I would get the food again. The lack of stars is because the cleanliness of the restaurant. There was trash on the floor.

Also, something that really bothered me for some reason is that they taped paper all over the window on the door to the kitchen like they really did not want anyone seeing back there. I dont know i never look into those windows but the fact that it was covered made me want to..."}
{"text":"Not to good of a looking restaurant on the outside, or the inside either, but the place is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is ALWAYS hot and fresh.  They do use msg, but that's okay, we only eat here once or twice a month.  The selection is \"small\" compared to some of the new, bigger places, but the food taste awesome. Check em' out!"}
{"text":"A great value! Well managed and courteous staff and the food makes the list of the better Chinese  buffets I've been to. Well done."}
{"text":"i've always drove by this place and never been, i finally went for my brother's bday lunch and i must say it was my first time there and my last this chinese buffet sucks! they can't even crack a smile and they have very little food that doesn't even taste good i did nothing but waste my money."}
{"text":"I can't believe some yelpers. I guess if you want a super specific review with lingo like meh and a review on how interesting the building is, look elsewhere. 

The food is good. It's cheap. Get it to go, cause like all buffets, it has MSG. It will fill you up quickly. You will get more when you get it to go. It's a bit run down, it's old. Not surprising for its location. If you like Chinese, buffet style, and don't expect PF Changs, this is good."}
{"text":"So I tried this place for the first time today because my uncle has been bugging me and told me it's his favorite restaurant and they have the best Chinese food ever. 

They were really busy and had a lot of to go orders. The employees worked very fast and I was out in 15 minutes. They load up your food!! The lid would barely shut and they are really cheap and you always have left overs. Once I tried the food it was just ehhh. I had a little bit of everything....lo mein , friend rice, cream cheese ragoons, orange chicken, and sweet and sour chicken. I felt like the food was mediocre and I actually would prefer Panda over this any day. I personally wouldn't go back and the parking also sucks. They seemed to be really busy and my family has been going there for several years, so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"We have been going to May Graden for quite some time. They do not have a big selection but what they do have is very delicious. The lo mein is amazing as are the cream puffs. The orange chicken, sesame chicken and fried rice are very good as well. The staff is always attentive certainly not friendly. We love this place and will continue to go back.
The one knock I will say is the restrooms are disgusting and the interior is very run down. Not dirty just run down. I understand the location is kind of in a poorer neighborhood but that should be no excuse for upkeep."}
{"text":"You ever do something and think \"that's gonna haunt me.\"? Yeah, this was one of those for me. Small selection, mediocre, greasy food. But yet, like a drunken lonely 20 something looking through old pics I find myself thinking of returning here. The chicken was the only part that was tasty. The pork was dry and hard like it'd been sitting under the heat lamp for hours though I'd just seen them bring out a fresh tray.

The soups are great! The lo mein and rice are awesome, but they disrespect their proteins.

The price is right, and the food decent. Great for feeding 4 kids, plus mom and dad for under $50."}
{"text":"When it comes to May Garden, you definitely get more bang for your buck. The take-out is definitely worth it! Not only is it cheap, but the portions are HUGE. I've never ordered off their menu because I'm very content with their buffet, but I will get around to trying it one of these days

The best things I love to get there are egg rolls, sesame chicken, chicken fried rice, and broccoli beef.

Overall the place is great even though it's in a less-than-perfect neighborhood. Everyone there is nice. It's family owned I assume because the same people are there every time I go in. It's definitely one of the best around the area!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Didnt get a chance to try the live roach next to me so one star for me."}
{"text":"Wish u could rate this place less. Let's start with the food. It was oily watered down and frankly tasted disgusting. A little run down and dirty restaurant, but the service was OK. I've been to worse looking restaurant's with way way better food. I'm so disappointed I was thinking \" hell, small buffet better food\" boy was I wrong. I'm just wandering how a place can mess up egg rolls."}
{"text":"We came here because of the good rating and we were NOT impressed! I have no logical idea how this place got such a high rating. Everything is fried and tastes like it was all cooked in the same oil. The lo mein was bland and lacked in vegetables. The egg rolls were oily and tasted weird. I spit out the one bite I took. The sesame chicken was so thickly battered that we had a hard time actually finding the chicken. The one small saving grace was that the egg drop soup was pretty good. The staff was attentive and polite but we will not ever be gong back there."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and were disappointed.  The only saving grace was their fried chicken.  It was tasty.

The other entrees made with chicken all tasted the same.  Rice was bland.  

Meh."}
{"text":"Been here forever and good for buffet. This is the only buffet l eat at. Not to many options but that's  why I thanks it's good. H I have been eating here over 20 years."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here about 5 years ago. At first i was unimpressed. The place looks like a total dive from the outside. Once inside i was still skeptical. This place has the expected cheesy Chinese decor. The cashier was very friendly. The food is absolutely delicious and you can't beat the price. Plus its all you can eat. Since then I have brought all my friends here and they agree that its one of the best \"cheap Chinese food\" buffets around."}
{"text":"What an intriguing establishment: a detached building with no windows whatsoever, and only the door (with grill) on the side prevents it from looking like the place is hermetically sealed. Definitely not a place for claustrophobic people.  Lots of cars in the parking lot when I came in (around 1:30 pm on a Thursday), but few people were in the dining area; most were near the front cashier area, waiting for their takeout. As I was going around the buffet area, it became clear why takeout is so popular here: the staff was busy OVERloading the takeout  boxes with food. A really generous amount of food for the money, indeed!

I tried most of the items, except for the salad and the fried chicken. I love fried chicken except for the thigh part, and their fried chicken was all thighs. The chop suey was really good, considering that the ingredients were minimal. The sweet and sour pork was good too; I saw the cook assemble the newly-fried pork and the sauce in the tray, instead of bringing in already-mixed stuff. Rand raved about the onion rings, so I had to try them ... and he was right, they are what I wish onion rings would be like in all places that serve onion rings. The sesame chicken and orange chicken were very tasty but on the overcooked and dry side. Nothing exceptional about the rest of the dishes. And while the fried rice was OK -- not good, just OK ... I got too used to the fantastic fried rice of Asian Cafe Express. I would have preferred white rice (which they didn't offer), since there was more than enough oil in the rest of the dishes already. 

I left the establishment satisfied but not thrilled, and somewhat relieved to be able to see again what the outside looks like. Not that it's the prettiest area to look at, but still, a few windows to let light into the building would have been nice."}

{"text":"Fried chicken!! Dang its gooooood! this is your once in a while greasy delicious chinese place. And its once in a while because so much fried food cant be good for you. Its comforting, full of flavor, simple yet has many options:
Vegetable Lo Mein
Fried Chicken(this is the best)
BBQ Pork Ribs(if you love bbq pork you will love these things)
Sesame Chicken(weirdly good)
Orange Chicken
Beef Brocolli
Onion Rings(these are probably the best onion rings i have had in arizona!)
These are just a few of the options ive had. i was full before i could try other options. its also very cheap. if i recall correctly it was about $8 per person or less. Ive had it to go once and i paid $9 with taxes(but man did they fill that box beyond its limit). 
*Beware though that to go orders gets busy. Ive had to wait 20 minutess for mine(i went to do another errand and still wasnt ready after 23 minutes but worth the wait). You dont serve yourself they serve you on to go orders. You pick what you want from a card that you checkmark the items you will like.

This is definately a hole in the wall but was a very clean place(except for the restroom that was junk)."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very reasonable price.  The server is courteous and I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good; egg foo young is excellent.  Very generous on take out $10.00 for dinner.  Interior is not so good letting the place deteriorate ceiling is nasty, carpet is filthy, they mop the tile floor with bleach I think over whelming when you're in line to get your food. Not in the best area."}
{"text":"May Garden has got to be one of the best Chinese restaurants.  I used to live near the May Garden in North Phoenix, and I loved it.  I used to eat there regularly, then one day it closed :(    I could not believe it.  It was just gone.  For years I was upset..........then one day I saw that there was 2 locations, and only 1 closed.  I knew I had to go!   The unfortunate thing was I had moved to California, so stopping for lunch was kind of out of the question.  So, on my last visit to Phoenix, I stopped by the other location.  It was just as good, if not better.  Do not get the buffet (not that it's bad), but instead order from the menu.  The chicken fried rice is really to die for as well as the egg rolls and crab puffs.  You will be in heaven!  Even though you are in the middle of Maryvale/Westridge area.  Its really worth the risk of getting shot."}
{"text":"Dinner Buffet is $8.00 plus $1.25 for Drink
Small selection, but a strong case of quality over quantity here..! Great service, right as I entered.. Although it took me a couple times to find the door with this building. =D"}
{"text":"Even though there isn't alot of options as a regular Chinese restaurant would have but the taste of the rice lo mein and everything else it's so good I love it"}
{"text":"Great place. It's hard to find a good Chinese buffet now days. This place has been run by the same family for 30 years. Good food at a good price."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst \"buffet\" in Phoenix.  Small  dirty   place with a very limited buffet line. This is more like going to a local cafeteria. If your looking for a buffet, this is not it"}
{"text":"The worst dam food I ever ate... So many people I know say its good... No... Food had no taste. I would never go back.. They prolly give you so much to make U happy till you realize it's gross"}
{"text":"Took my mother and daughter on a Friday night instead of our regular pizza night and was pleasantly surprised on the good food and atmosphere. The price was right. A lot of pork choices, would of liked some more chicken or vegetables choices, but over all the food was good. Will be returning."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. I have been coming here since I was a youngster. There used to be 3 locations but the only one left is here in the hood. It's worth the trip for me to come from Surprise and get the \"to go buffet\"! Still the same awesome food all these years!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Chinese buffet with a ton of variety  this isn't  the place for you first off. It's  small but food is awesome for the price. Less then $9 bucks per person to dine in and for a couple dimes more to take out which is definitely worth it cause they pack the box to the point it barely closes! I'm usually eating a take out box 2 days in a row cause i always have leftovers the next day cause its a lot of food. Alot of the items are fried but definitely yummy like the fried chicken and sesame chicken. If you are looking for cheap more then decent Chinese food this is the spot."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have eaten in.  Previously I had some else pick me up take out.  AT $6.25 for lunch it is an excellent value.  At $6.55 for take out lunch it is even more of a value.  Picture mashing down on your suitcase to get the lid to close and you will have an idea of how much food you get in your take out box, they actually do mound it up and then force the lid down.  Two hungry adults would do well to finish it.

I was in a vegetable mood so I started off with salad (fresh iceburg with dressing) a slightly spicy cole slaw, jello and a bowl of egg drop soup. I had a variety of meats and vegetables on my next two trips.  Nothing really stood out and several items seemed overcooked although nothing was bad enough I left any on my plate.  My favorites were the orange chicken, beef with broccoli and the egg roll.  Dessert is vanilla soft serve, with or without Hersheys syrup.

The place is kept clean.  It wasn't too busy in the dining room but there was also a steady stream of take out customers.  They kept drinks full and plates cleared pretty quick. The parking lot was over 1/2 full when I left just before noon.  This place has a steady following of customers."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was little. Best pork noodle soup ever! The buffet is awesome as well. Good prices. Also try to order off the menu. The drums of heaven are delish."}
{"text":"Awsome variety of food great selections and well maintained line. We have taken the take out box and it is enough food to eat two or three days. Its a great value for your money."}
{"text":"I had this place about 5 years ago and swore never again. My wife likes it so I agreed to give it another try today. Judging by my wife and other reviewers on here, it appears people who grew up on this food seem to be the only ones who can appreciate it. Our kids, who joined us today asked that we never go there again, guess the wife is on her own the next time she feels like eating here!

1. It is like walking into a time portal and boom! You are back to 1978 complete with popcorn ceiling and a bug zapper on the back wall. 

2. A very small serving line with limited food options.

3. The restrooms, I actually felt bad for the business owner on this one. The restrooms are littered with graffiti from low life people who feel a restroom is a place to write your name. I will never understand people who would even want to touch a wall in a public restroom to scribble some mess that only the author can read. 

My wife swears by the ginger wings and the fried chicken and insisted we all try it. I have to admit both were not bad tasting, but it does beg the question. Is the ginger wings and the fried chicken the greatest or are they both the only edible items on the line? Its like we paid to eat fried chicken and ginger wings. 

My two stars are intended for the \"Meh, I've experienced better\". I did not have a bad experience here and the staff was friendly. However this review is my opinion and I am certain I will not be back to this place again."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I was little with my grandparents and my parents. Everytime I stayed the night with Grandma and she asked what I wanted for dinner and my response was ALWAYS \"May Garden\", so I would get on her rotary phone (that was my play toy) and invited Patrick Swayze to come with us lol. We've been going there so long now that the owner Grace knows us and always asks about the family if they aren't with us. Aside from being a great family owned and locally owned restaurant the food is what keeps us coming back. They have never changed any items over the years and it always tastes amazing! I've never really been into buffets but this place is the exception.  Their fried rice is made with Pork which is not typically standard so that's nice and the egg rolls are the crispy fully loaded ones, but the best dish IMO are the RIBS!!! Omg fall off the bone-melt in your mouth-juicy ribs. They are super quick for take out and always stack your to go plate full of food so you always get your money's worth and can feed like 3 people on 1 order."}
{"text":"My mom used to take us here all the time for a cheap eat when me and my brother were younger. I loved it back then.  We took my mom here for Mothers day and guess what, I STILL LOVE IT!
Yea, the menu doesn't change, but the food is still good.  The ribs are tender, the sweet orange chicken tastes like it just came out of whatever they use to cook it, and the rice and noodles are soft and seasoned well.   The egg drop soup is hot and tasty, the wontons are crispy, and the egg rolls are so good.  Only reason I have given it four stars is because they haven't updated the tables and chairs and decorations in over 20 years...but the food is reasonably priced and it is fresh food."}
{"text":"I used to work here as busboy back in 1983-1984.  It's nice to see the same owners still here, I recently moved back into the area and checked it out again and have been back a few times.  The food is basically the same, with some new items to me.  Glad they stayed consistent.  Yes the building expanded to allow for more seating, I remember when the line would be out the door.  The customer service is still good as well.  It's nice to see these classic/original Chinese buffets, much better than those super ones. No would definitely come back from time to time."}
{"text":"For the price, this place is very good.  This is one of my boyfriend (and his friends) fave place to eat as far as cheap buffets go.  Ive been here a couple times myself and am very impressed with the food I got, the service and the price I paid.  They take credit card/ cash and is 7.99 for buffet lunch.  Their best dishes are the egg drop soup, chow mein, fried rice, sesame chicken and the fried chicken!  Their fried chicken is better than any other fried chicken ive had and we love fried chicken haha.  The chow mein is very good, its cooked just right and has good flavor!  Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was meh but for the price isn't horrible. Egg rolls tasted hella weird and the rice wasn't the best. Again for the price this isn't too bad but o would personally never go again. I'd rather lay $5 to eat at a bigger buffet like LINS or Hibachi grill which are pretty much just down the road from this place. The variety was.. lacking and I honestly only got one serving. Skip this place if you can but if it's the closest place to you and you don't have a ride, go for it."}
{"text":"This buffet has been there for 30+ years. It's one of the best low cost Chinese buffets I know. I come here mostly for the soups and meat. They have beef and broccoli and mixed vegetables with seafood, soft lo mein type noodles, along with chicken chop suey over crunchy noodles, and they're all good.

Both the egg drop and hot n sour are very good. I like the fried mushrooms and zucchini. The char siu pork ribs are delicious but only put out for dinner. The fried chicken and honey sesame chicken are other favorites. They don't have the selection of the mega chains, but I like the homemade flavor here better. The ribs are my favorite."}
{"text":"Ate here and got extremely sick from food poisoning for 2 days. I have tried several chinese restaurants and buffets that are good in Phoenix, but this was just awful. I will never go back to this one after it made me sick like that."}
{"text":"Doing something right this place has been here for over 25 years. Now I don't come here very often but I have been here several times in past 25 years. Everything is the same . Nothing has changed. Almost everything on their buffet is exactly how it's always been.  It's ok. I also notice if you take out they  seem to load up on the food."}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese Food.  Good Prices and lots of variety. We will go back when we are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place does not have a huge variety of food. Worst taste ever for Chinese. I take it this place caters to that area and the people in that neighborhood. Was disappointed and would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a smorgasbord of Chinese food for $8. I always get my lunch to-go, and it's good for like 3 big meals. 

The menu is simple...like, really simple. One small page of very few items, and no seafood, not even fried fish or anything. This is a cheap buffet in every sense, but that's justified by the price. 

So you're pretty much limited to variations of fried/grilled chicken, sweet & sour pork, and noodles or rice. I love the grilled chicken the most, but everything else is hit or miss. I guess my biggest issue is that sometimes, when it's busy, I'm getting something very fresh and tasty. But during slower hours, the food was borderline inedible. We're talking rock hard sesame chicken that I'd cut open to reveal some of the driest meat ever. Like, leave your food out in the fridge exposed for two days, and then microwave it to oblivion. It was THAT dry. 

In the end, I really want to dislike this place, but I came back. Twice. In two weeks. If I show up at the right time, and seek to satisfy my Chinese fix on the cheap for an entire weekend, then I suppose this will do. And that's why it's seemingly the oldest buffet in the area."}
{"text":"We order the buffet to go all the time. We've been eating here for years and are never disappointed. Good food for a great price!"}
{"text":"Maygarden has been at their location since I can remember, I grew up eatting here. The serving sizes are amazing especially if you have children and want to budget you can turn 1 tray into 3 serving sizes or 4!! ... I love the food OC orange chicken is fried so perfectly, BF beef broccoli is okay. FM fried mushrooms are s good, and then we have the egg rolls.. my gosh these egg roll with lemon juice has me complimenting every bite."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since the 80's same owners I think. Small buffet place but omg the food is fantastic and they never change their menu thank goodness. My favorite is the short ribs, the egg foo yung and the egg drop soup."}
{"text":"Cheap, decent food not the best. Not the worst. I notice when I eat here I get a awkward fullness. My stomach got jacked from this place. The pork rib had a strong old meat taste. Wasn't feeling this place as much this visit. I actually decided im not eating here no more and I have for many years. I called in today from work last nights visit jacked my stomach up."}
{"text":"I gotta say, as far as Chinese Buffet's go, this is by far my favorite, and has been since I was a kid!  I love their food, and it's always clean and busy. It's a small place, but they have a large selection, and keep the food fresh. NO ONE has Chow Mien as good as May Garden's! I love it here, and whenever I'm in town and can convince the family to do Chinese, this is my place!"}
{"text":"I dined-in here quite a few times as a child (and liked it) but now and days, my family hits this place up for take out. I really like the food here and I like the portions. It's a good place to go when you want leftovers to eat for later. I have never gotten take out here and eaten the entire thing in one sitting. Good place to get some lunch, and then just eat the rest for dinner. I am a big fan."}
{"text":"This place was not worth the money. Panda express would have been better. Seriously, don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I wish I had talked Zoe into Siu Wok...
Ugh.  Ok, this place is cheap.  That's always a plus.  We wanted take-out from the buffet.  You get a card (kinda like at Chino Bandito) and mark what you want from the buffet.  Hostess takes card to the buffet and fills your take-out box.  Ok, here is where she actually GETS stars.  My box was full.  Overloaded.  Always a plus, as Chinese take-out is always good the next day.  Lo Mein, sesame chicken, egg roll (she gave me 2!), beef with broccoli, some shrimp thing and BBQ pork ribs.  
8.18 with tax for what has turned out (so far) to be 4 meals.  There is a complete lack of flavor for most of the dishes.  The only one that actually HAD flavor was the ribs.  The rest?  MEH.  I never use \"meh,\" but in this case, it works.
There was only one packet of soy sauce in the bag.  No sweet and sour for my egg rolls.  The lo mein?  No flavor.  Shrimp thing?  Actually had shrimp in it, but, still, no flavor.
I'm a bit pissed, because I had a real craving for Chinese food.  What I really got was Grandma making Chinese that Gramps could eat without feeling it the next day.
Me, I'm not feeling this place at ALL.  
The only thing that got them stars was the size of the take-out portion and the price.  
MEH."}
{"text":"Love the foods they made. My family and I always go to that place. I'm giving 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I've literally been coming here once a week for about 10 years I love this this place .... Sesame seed chicken is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent, inexpensive Chinese food buffet. Restaurant is clean and the staff manages to keep the buffet line stocked even when the restaurant is packed! You can't  find a better deal in town. Oh, and their all-you-can-eat $7.95 dinner buffet includes an ice cream machine, too!"}
