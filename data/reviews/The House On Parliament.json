{"text":"I had the fish n chips to go so I'm mostly speaking on how I really liked it. The slaw was one I could eat and I hate slaw. It is a more upscale place than I am use to. The ambience was nice, quieter, something I expect more in the suburbs actually. The patio looks like I will be returning in the summer especially for the nachos. Good date place I think. 
Fish was large and tasty and the tartar was something I could eat. I also don't normally do tartar."}
{"text":"I've only heard fantastic things about HOP so my friends and I celebrated a birthday here.

Friday night is definitely super busy; the 4 of us waited about an hour for our table, but we didn't mind.... beer helps :D. They definitely have an amazing selection of beers on tap and a great variety of wines. 

We were finally seated in the upstairs seating area (there's 4 tables for groups of 4-5 there) and got our orders taken fairly quickly. Food came a little slowly, but it didn't bother us. We ordered our own dishes and sampled around the table. The BBQ Pull Pork Sandwich was deliciously saucey...a little on the sweet and salty side, but with the bread it was fine. The side of fries it came with was just a fantastically huge artery-clogging portion. The Steak and Wild Mushroom Pie had the perfect crust but I found the filling much too salty. I did like the mash and veggies it came with.. but it wasn't the best I've had. I liked the Tortiere pie better. The meat filling had more spices and the jalepeno chutney had a sweetness that balanced the salty filling. 

Service was good and waiters were friendly. They were a little slow (even after most customers had left), but I enjoyed it enough to come back. 

5 stars minus 1 for the salt monster that invaded my pie."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Had the cider on tap- lovely. The calamari had a loose breading and game with a mayo sauce. Half the time the breading got left behind in the mayo. I would much prefer a tomato sauce. I also ordered the fries with the aioli- but the side of aioli was so small, I could barely fit a fry in to taste it- needs more and in a better container. I will go back to try other meals, but as for these two appetizers, they were meh and overpriced. Love the front and roof patio."}
{"text":"One of the best pub meals I've had in Toronto. I ordered burger from their daily menu and it was just delicious! The burger was HUGE, with two onion rings and bacon inside it. And it was perfect in all way! 
I liked the vibe.It was nice and cozy. 
What I didn't like about the place was its service. We went there on a Friday evening and we were told by the lady at the door that the wait time is 20 minutes but we ended up waiting there for 45 minutes. From the way she managed our case and other customers I got the impression that she tries to keep as mangy as customers as possible. Also, when we sat at our table, it took the waiter 15 minutes to bring us the menus and take our drink orders. In general I wasn't happy with their service.
 
But still I go back for their great burgers!"}
{"text":"I had the best steak of my life here. It was a very long wait for a late dinner, (some of the specials had sold out before I could order) - but I did not leave hungry or disappointed. 

I found the lunch service to be smoother and quicker on a separate occasion, but again the food was just phenomenal. This place is not simply just a watering hole. There's something magical and majestic going on in that kitchen that just can't be described. Making plans to trek back to cabbagetown for brunch."}
{"text":"I love their Squire Breakfast: Egg any style, Home style potatoes, sausage, ham, Bacon, baked beans, and toast."}
{"text":"The place is small but cozy and is a great place if you're looking for delicious pub food. I almost always order the hummus there; they serve it with sesame pita and sundried olives; it's so delicious. Last time we were there on half-price wing night; the wings are quite good and I'm not a fan of wings."}
{"text":"The food here is no question 5 stars, but I am giving it 4 because service is so inconsistent.  To be fair this is a very busy place and the food is incredible. Have tried half the menu and it never disappoints. One of the best pubs in the city."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed House on Parliament. Great food with plenty of it. Nice and cosy atmosphere, good service with a good price point. Fish and chips with perfect batter and sticky toffee pudding were the highlights.

Would come back and recommend as a good local spot."}
{"text":"I love the new location of The House on Parliament. The old one felt dark and cramped. This new location is bigger and has way more seating options. The cranky waitress is even less cranky - if you've been there, you know which lady I'm referring to ;D 

We only go for Sunday brunch and it hits the mark every time. The patio is elevated to prevent crazy people from pestering you while you are trying to eat (unless you are sitting with them) 

**if you wake up in Cabbage Town and you need to go for brunch, this is the place**"}
{"text":"Mondays is Wingnight - 6 $
Good wings and great sweet potatoe fries. Nice staff too..."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 10 times and never had a bad meal.  Not your typical pub food. Very presentable, tasty, and good size dishes.  Great selection of Drafts.  My only complaint is that the place is too busy and hard to get a seat, but that is because it is so amazing."}
{"text":"We have frequently gone here since moving to the neighbourhood 18 months ago.

Had a late lunch yesterday. We ordered a prime rib sandwich and a steak sandwich and shared them, delicious...but we both experienced tummy issues a few hours later. This is the second time we have had problems with food here. Service was indifferent.

Great place to go in the evening and for a beer and share a serving of their great frites...but we will not be having another meal here."}
{"text":"Best pub in the city. Specials are excellent value and change nightly. Team based service is usually quick and friendly. Only downside is that patio is fairly 'enclosed' and they allow smoking so there really is no getting away from the smoke."}
{"text":"Great pub.  Excellent food and an admirable wine list.  You don't normally see such a good wine list in a place like this -- very impressed.  Staff work together to make sure all tables are looked after.  This is how it's done."}
{"text":"If you're looking for excellent, nicer pub food, this is your spot! I've recommended House on Parliament to so many people and no one has ever been disappointed. I especially love their veggie sandwich and my boyfriend loves their steak sandwich. The service isn't always the best, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Wow - I am very surprised at all the negative reviews of this place!

HOP probably serves the best food of any pub in the city - it is delicious!  I've been there a few times and have to make recommendations: homestyle potatoes during brunch, the fish when it's on special, and the steak, however it is served, are all excellent.

Yes, it gets packed, but that's part of the character.  It has got a loyal following of frequent visitors that always keep the place lively...  can't complain about a busy pub in downtown Toronto... if you don't like that, go to Jack Astors.  

The only knock it gets on the stars is the length of time it takes to get the food - we waited 60 minutes once for our dinner...  the waiter was very apologetic to us and bought us drinks and offered us free desert.  

The waiters are always nice and friendly - I have never experienced rudeness from them.

I reluctantly recommend this place - reluctant because I don't want more people to go there!  It makes it harder to get a table!"}
{"text":"Sorry, not this time.

First let me say that I've enjoyed coming here for YEARS. Before and after the move. And I've been here for everything - brunch, lunch, dinner, drinks - recommending this place to friends, clients and visitors alike. The food is consistently great and I love the atmosphere. Service has been perfect till last Sunday...

My friend and I were enjoying brunch on the patio. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with a salad.  Partway through the first half of the sandwich, our server handed me a small takeout box.  Surprised, as I thought she had the wrong table, I asked her what that's for.  She said the other half of my sandwich. Um, ok. I didn't ask for it and was planning on finishing my brunch there but ok, I took the box and thought, well just in case I guess.

On to the salad.  Again, mid way through, the server gave us the bill.  So I said half jokingly \"oh, am I eating too slow?\".  She said - no its Sunday, people want to get moving.  I looked around - a few empty tables and no line up for the patio.  Seriously?

My friend and I felt like we were being asked to leave so I packed up the other half of my sandwich (which I ate in the car on the way home) and left.

I really hope that was an off day for that particular server because I don't want to write this place off.  But come on - there's \"efficient\" and then there's rude."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The wild boar eggs are definitely a highlight, just perfect!.  My husband and I are used to eating out (work/travel/etc), however we are not used to having such a delicious tasting food experience!  We are definitely coming back next time we are in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We had a smoked duck salad and steak mushroom pie. Everything was delicious. The interior is very nice. Overall great place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I guess it is good as a regular. Sat at the bar around 5. Server acknowledged me after about 5 minutes--mostly talking to a regular at the end of the bar. Get my pint and a menu. 

3/4 of the way through my pint finally asked if I wanted to order. At that point? No, thanks. 

The food is good here, but the service? Let's just say the food isn't that good."}
{"text":"Was hoping for 3rd time lucky but ended in 3rd time fail! 
The food I have tried is typical pub fare cooked well. 
What makes this place fabulous is the pub itself, lovely decor, nice furnishings and outdoor space. What makes this place Meh is the service, each time I have been here it hasn't been good, not necessarily rude but not friendly either. The place is always busy so maybe they don't have to try so hard but for me when I pay money to eat at your establishment I expect to feel welcome."}
{"text":"Very nice place for dinner and brunch but can get quite noisy at times 
Yes I realize that it is a pub, but at one point at our dinner service, I could not carry on a normal converstion with my wife because of the noise level 
Very good food and good value for money 
Definitely a great neighborhood hang out place"}
{"text":"Lovely casual brunch. It's no wonder this place is a neighborhood staple. Had the omelette which was smoked salmon and Brie, and it was generous. Pricing is very competitive."}
{"text":"I have only been there about three times and I always leave with a full and satisfied stomach.  Plus it is a guaranteed that I will be leaving with a takeout bag, their portion is always huge and at a really decent price.  Their fries are so good, not sure what kind of oil they use, but it must be the good kind.  I had the lucky chance to have their duck confit - the meat melted in my mouth, so yummy.  And the Calamari is a must try, very soft and delicious.  I highly recommended this place for a casual dine and cosy meal.  I am so eager to bring all my friends to experience their good food. Beware they do not accept reservations, first come first serve, so you either go early, or later to avoid long wait time."}
{"text":"Best pub food in Toronto. They have the best scotch eggs anywhere. Their pull pork is great, their burgers are amazing, and they have specials that change frequently. This is one of the best places to eat in the city."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch spots in the city! Affordable, good quality food (and big portions), really cozy atmosphere with authentic British inspiration - love this place!"}
{"text":"I thought I was a fan, but after today, I'm a bit dubious, especially on the consistency.

The first time I went, I had the provimi liver and eggs with a spicy caesar. Both were amazing. The caesar had horseradish and it was spiced just perfectly, (although it is hard to screw up a caesar really, but still). The provimi liver and scrambled eggs were great and were both cooked 'well done', just as requested.  There's a lot of food, so bring your appetite. I was excited with having found a new brunch place and raved about it to whomever.

Today however, the caesar was watery and rimmed very blotchy with celery salt and marguerita salt? And I found all the tabasco sauce at the bottom of the drink. The provimi liver was not well cooked; still very pink and bleeding in some corners, into the eggs. The scrambled eggs were semi-raw; the texture very wet.  There was definitely a huge difference between the first and second visit. So disappointing.

My partner had ordered the Scotch breakfast and although the dish looked great, the meat smelled and tasted like it was going bad. There was a semi sour-pungent taste and smell to it.  And when we got home, we both had to use the washroom. 

Overall, I'd give it another try, because the dishes sound so interesting. But my initial perception of the place changed after today."}
{"text":"This restaurant is among my favourite in the city. I'm not a huge meat eater, but HOP makes me crave their amazing steak pies and tourtière. The steak frites is even good as takeout. We have several family members from out of town that ask to be taken back every time they visit. The atmosphere is laid back and the staff know how to keep the pints coming and the wine flowing (without judgment!!)."}
{"text":"Service was fast, attentive and warm. Incredible ambience and very cozy. We got the  vodka smoked salmon plate, prime rib dinner and fish and chips. Everything was delicious, huge portions. Great beer selection!"}
{"text":"The House On Parliament is a beautiful pub on Parliament just south of Carlton. The space is gorgeous, recently renovated the interior is classic British pub meets high style Roman + Williams-designed space (like the lobby of the Ace Hotel). Tons of selvage wood, exposed Edison bulbs. Super cozy.

Everyone talks about how good the food is at the House on Parliament. After my first visit on Sunday, I don't think I'd order food again. 

Ordered the steak & stilton cheese sandwich. There wasn't anything terribly wrong with it other than the steak being super chewy. The side salad was pretty sad, two cherry tomatoes on very standard mix greens with a poorly mixed vinaigrette (too much oil). Others in my party ordered burgers, which came so overcooked they were like shoe leather. Not good at all.

For a pub with such a great reputation and in a very good location, you'd think they'd try harder in the food area. Prohibition at Queen/Broadview is such a better choice for a pub-type resto with great food.

Overall, I love the space, didn't care for the food, and would probably only go back for drinks."}
{"text":"Came here on suggestion from a hotel reception desk staff: a place off the beaten path where locals go. Off the beaten path is a bit of an understatement - from downtown, it was an interesting walk through a rough-around-the-edges neighborhood. I'd suggest taking a taxi if going for a late dinner as we did. 

I had a really great glass of wine, shared the beet salad, and steelhead trout for my main. Beet salad had buffalo mozzarella and basil so I came across as a caprese with golden beets; not bad, but not really what I expected. As far as the trout, I found the horseradish to be a bit overpowering and the coulis too smoky for the mild fish. My date had the steak frites which he found to be too chewy for his liking. 

Service was fair. It was loud and pretty crowded on a Thursday evening. I'd try it again when in Toronto."}
{"text":"One of the best pubs in Toronto.  The food is delicious and priced fairly. The new location and mansion-type atmosphere is much nicer and classier.  The Prime Rib dinner on Sunday is great, but the Prime Rib Sandwiches on Monday are much better! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great vibrant atmosphere, food was very good, the menu had lots of options and was a very exciting menu.. Service was beyond great.. I would definitely come back here without a hesitation.."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!!!! 

Ran into a couple ppl around the hood, and they were telling me how amazing the Boar Burger and the Beef Short Ribs were. They were saying the ribs were just so tender and falling...which made me wanted to go there to check it out. 

We ordered Pulled Pork Sandwich, Steak and Wild Mushroom Pie, The Club Sandwich, Smoked Duck Breast Salad. Sandwiches came with fries or you can substitute with sweet potato fries for extra two bucks. The Steak and Mushroom pie came with mashed potato...it was a huge portion but it was nicely done. The pulled pork sandwich came in with an 8-inch baguette, nicely toasted with a bit of crunchiness, and loaded with pulled pork. We couldn't fit any desserts in coz we were so stuffed from what we ordered. All dishes are around 10-12 dollars, very decent serving size for the price you are paying. 

Service wise was okay, coz it is more like a pub and it got music playing at the background...not super loud but you do needa speak up a bit when talking to others. The seating for patio is interesting, they don't sit group of more than 4 at the patio. By all means, if you happen to go there with a big group, and you wanna be seated at the patio, don't tell them you are together, ha!

Definitely would go back again! :)"}
{"text":"For a lucky year or so I worked in Cabbagetown, and House on Parliament was always a favorite stop of mine for a quick lunch or drinks after work with my coworkers.  The staff always remembered what we liked and welcomed us warmly, and the food was great. 

The closest thing to a gastropub in Cabbagetown, the House offers your usual array of beers on tap and pub grub like burgers and wings.  But their dinner menu and daily specials always feature a heightened palate - leg of lamb, kobe beef burgers, duck confit with various deglazed or otherwise fancy toppings and side dishes.  It is a lovely escape from your usual burgers and french fries.

Everyone always raved over their sweet potato fries, I personally am not a huge yam fan but I did like a serving of regular fries with their tasty garlic aioli.  I have to say I was sad when their french fry making gizmo was replaced, because their crispy shoestring fries studded in sea salt bits were perfect in my mind.  The new ones are good too but a little too chunky in my mind.  

Standouts on the menu in my memory include the pulled pork sandwich, any time I ordered duck and the veggie burger, which came loaded with sprouts, hummus and veggies.  I know that the kitchen/staff has gone through some changes, so I can't guarantee that this place is the same as the last time I was there, which was around a year ago, however I will update this post as soon as I go again."}
{"text":"Consistently great good. Good selection of drinks and friendly staff. One of our favorite places to go. You'll normally find yourself waiting for a table but it's worth it. Grab a drink at the bar relax for bit. The specials are normally phenomenal, and sell out quick, for good reason."}
{"text":"I love this place.

The food is all amazing, I have come here multiple times and have loved every moment of it.

I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like this place, it has a great ambience, great selection of drinks, great food and great service. The pricing is entirely fair.

The fish and chips, pulled pork sandwich, lamb shank dish, caesar salad and pretty much their entire brunch menu is remarkable. The eggs parliament (brunch) are amazing, the jalapeño chutney is a great addition.

It gets very busy here for dinner and on weekends, so typically there is a little bit of a wait, but its all worth it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food coupled with a charming atmosphere make this gastropub a frequent repeat spot for me.  The presentation of the food is always on pointe and the prices are great. that topped off with the friendly and down to earth waitstaff give this place 5 stars for me. 
I've tried almost the whole menu and loved it all, and every guest I've brought has had nothing but compliments. 
They also have a daily specials menu that has truly delicious options if you want something a little more than just their standard menu. 
Brunch, lunch or dinner this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I don't come often but I always love the atmosphere and food here. Elevated pub food. The steak and mushroom pie is great. Not just a pie crust top (which when done, is the worst of the worst) but a beautiful hearty pie on top of mashed potatoes. Yum. 

They don't have a cocktail that I used to love (some Bourbon, ginger, thyme thing) but I can't expect menus to stay stagnant."}
{"text":"Very good mains. Superlative desserts. Was my first time but will be back. Nice setting and good service with a sense of humour too"}
{"text":"A great spot to sit back, relax, have a few local or international pints, and let the hours waste away. You don't have to worry about leaving because they also have an awesome menu of upscale pub fare. I suggest picking from the specials, there's always something new and delicious.

The last time I went I had the grilled cheese with smoked bacon, smoked cheese, and a tomato sauce. The bacon was cooked perfectly and the flavours went perfectly together (as you'd expect). They're served with a mountain of delicious fries, which I could barely make a dent in.

They have a small patio out front, you'll be lucky if you get on it, but give it a shot. My companion and I managed to find a spot on Toronto's hottest day ever, but not until later in the evening when the temperature had died down a bit.

I think the best way to describe HoP is an unpretentious Cabbagetown mainstay with food and service that put pretentious bars to shame."}
{"text":"Okay, so for any of you who haven't been to the HoP in a little while ... the service has definitely improved!! All those who are new have got it all figured out now and the service is as seemless as it was before. 

Also, try their dessert if you've never gotten around to it. It's sooo good! The keylime pie was so tangy and fresh and the peanut butter pie was as rich as you could imagine!"}
{"text":"Only been there once. Great pub! Really clean but with a warm feel. The food was good and the staff is really friendly...looking forward at going back!

Grab a seat by the front window and you'll get to people watch some of the \"interesting\" characters from the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great theory, great new rooftop patio, great beer list, poor execution, poor value. Love the menu on paper but it's often too salty or disproportionately portioned or overdone or all of the above.  Echo the issues with the new servers... tonight they screwed up both my wife's order and my own, and didn't refill water. I want to be a regular but every trip there's something off-putting."}
{"text":"First time visiting today. Had a house special of chicken and shrimp curry. It was great! Huge portions, very friendly customer service. A little too much broccoli in the curry for my preference but that did not diminish the actual taste at all. Chicken was very tender. Shrimp was a tad overcooked but still tasty. The Naan served with it was not traditional but tasty and interesting! I'd eat there again and would eat that dish again anytime. We went around 3 pm on a Monday so we easily got in no problem but have been told it gets very busy."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place. The food was excellent. I had the fish and chips, while my husband had the steak pie. One of the best meals I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"A great business lunch. Amazingly diverse menu for such a small operation. Chefs specials very enticing. Could have stayed a lot longer but business calls........."}
{"text":"A favourite local haunt, this place is my go-to for good beer, great food and a nice atmosphere. It's quite loud in the evenings, which makes it my favourite date-night spot, since after a few beers my laugh tends to escalate in volume as well. 

It's nearly always busy, so expect to wait for a table. With 2-4 people, I've never had to wait long, and they'll serve you drinks while you wait at the bar. 

They have rotating specials, that are usually a great price, but I nearly always end up getting fish and chips. I crave their fries and mayo. All. The. Time."}
{"text":"Just in from Scotland on a family holiday. We needed someplace to eat and this place was well rated on Yelp and importantly close by.

Went in, welcome was very friendly and relaxed, no problem seating the 5 of us. Staff were genuinely nice, not that overly friendly but obviously fake American style I have had in so many places on this continent, just friend and down to earth.  Ordered drinks and food, both came promptly. Food was really good, with a good range on thebmrnu and they had a great range of beers.

All in all a really good experience, it's good to be back in this country."}
{"text":"Best. Fries. Ever.

Good menu with a solid variety, very good drink offerings. It is a really well decorated and nice space. Great for brunch but always busy. I like that the kitchen is open until late. There are a few tvs peppered around the upper bar area but not too distracting.

This sounds like a small detail but I think the place would *look* so much better if the servers wore uniforms, or at least t shirts or something. They are always in a random mash of button down shirts, a couple people in a way too faded t-shirt...This isn't a super high end expensive place,but the staff never looks very put together and for such a nice, cozy decor they stick out like a sore thumb."}
{"text":"Great food! Steak sandwhich and Steak pie is my fav  service is really slow all the time when i go but i deal with it because the food is so good :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening. Had to wait a few minutes for a table. During that time the attentive staff let us order a drink while we waited. The restaurant itself is medium Sized, it's a British casual decor. 

The beer selection was overall good though not wide. We ordered the Scotch eggs, steak and Stilton with ceaser and smoked duck salad. The smoked duck salad was excellent. The Scotch eggs as well were very good and came with a side of arugalla salad which was delicious.  However the caesar salad came as a giant halves of whole Lettuce leaves that no human could easily eat. And the Stilton steak did not have sufficient Stilton flavour.  

Service was great though. The kitchen forgot out Scotch eggs but the error was immediately noticed by our server who took care of that dish for us (compt-ed it) and tracked ir down without us even having to mention or ask. I would come back and try some of the other interesting sounding dishes on the menu.  But don't get Caesar salad."}
{"text":"I can't elaborate on how good HOP is because it'll become too popular and I want it as my hidden gem."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! But the service has been getting worse over the years. 
My most recent experience was for my sister's birthday dinner. We were served by a young woman who was very unpleasant throughout the night. She barely came by the table and forgot orders we made. As we were leaving the restaurant, she called us from the back of the room asking if we wanted change. Upon receiving her tip (or lack thereof) she created a scene and embarrassed my group. 

I'm trying to decide whether or not I should go back. I miss the delicious food but I wouldn't want to face that waitress again."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was horrible.  

My boyfriend and I wanted to have a quick bite here since we heard the food was good.  It took at least 20 minutes for the food to come after we ordered, which is a bit longer than expected.  We then asked for a take out box, and also for the bill.  Right when the lady put down the bill, my boyfriend asked for the card machine and she said \"one minute\", which is fine.  But when she came back with the machine, she started making these unnecessary comments like \"oh you're a busy man, you want everything immediately\".  This just made us a bit uncomfortable, I dont see the point of mocking us, especially we really were in a hurry."}
{"text":"I am so glad to call this fabulous establishment my \"local\". Fancy pub food meets cozy home cooked sunday dinner. I love eating here, the staff are awesome and I'm never disappointed. Their steak/mushroom pie and those bangers/mash = unreal."}
{"text":"Came with really high hopes to HOP based on the reviews. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Service was extremely slow. Took us half an hour to get the food. I ordered Eggs Florentine. The sauce was sour and the eggs were well done. Their home fries had way too much batter and I felt like I was just eating grease instead of fries. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service, line up to wait went Fast. New menu items to try out : shootine! Amazing recipe, and can't go wrong with 5 dollar mimosas and beermosas :) 
Brought friends for the first time and very impressive first impression.
Top Toronto brunch destinations."}
{"text":"Best pub in the city, with excellent food, a cast of regulars, and a lovely staff who are absolute pros. Be prepared to wait if you go during dinner rush pretty much any night of the week (but you'll never need to wait long.) If you've never been, the wait list \"system\" may seem chaotic, but whoever is managing the door will remember where you are in the queue and get you seated ASAP. It's best to go with parties of 2 - 4.

Great tap and wine list. They've recently started doing cocktails, which are, sadly, so so (Caesar with homemade carrot pickle gets my vote!).

The food is fantastic and very fairly priced--you cannot go wrong with anything, particularly their specials, which are always inventive and delicious. Prime rib dinner on Sundays is a steal. Especially love the burger, steak & stilton sandwich, and the wings. Weekend brunch is a treat --Eggs Parliament and Squire's Breakfast are both winners."}
{"text":"i love this place!

We (the husband and I) typically go to this place on Friday nights. They have a GREAT specials menu!! Had their Southern BBQ beef ribs last I time I went and oh em gee! huge serving of sweet and tangy tender ribs with a side of grilled corn and fries... the details just make it for me! 

Good selection of beers and wine. Pumpkin beer is perfect for the ladies!"}
{"text":"Pros: 
+ Consistently good pub/gastropub food. Definitely not the mediocre pub food at some of the other bar chains around the city. I'm talking proper food, good ingredients and they mix it up with great options on the daily specials. Not to mention, pretty large portions. Overall, excellent value for the price. 

+ The feature wines and beers are always delicious. 

+ The staff are all really friendly and start to recognize you as a regular, which you will likely want to become after a visit. 

+ Lots of seating available. 

When there is a line, the bar staff will take your order so you can have a drink in line +++ 

+ I've even gotten take-out and it's just as delicious when we get home. 

Cons: Not a real con, but the line? It's not even that serious, it's a busy place and sometimes there's a line but it moves fast enough depending on how large of a group you have. 

The Crowd: A good mix between your everyday Cabbagetown locals that hang out at the bar, groups of friends, young families, couples and then a larger mix of \"young professionals\" (hate that term) in the area as the night progresses."}
{"text":"This is a terrific neighbourhood restaurant. I say restaurant because \"pub\" does not do it justice. The food here is on par with other great Toronto resto-pubs, like the Oxley, which is high praise for me (though the drinks there are better). I had the prime rib sandwich on Monday, a really big meal but also delicious: juicy, with a great horseradish sauce. I had salad instead of fries, and it was more than Jair iceberg lettuce and a few tomatoes. It felt like it was really prepared, cared for. Looking around other dishes looked tremendous too. 

One more thing is that the service was excellent. Attentive and knowledgeable.

I will be back."}
{"text":"I have been this place many times and it is a nice local pub. I think it depends on their menu, food can be okay to excellent. I love their steak special because a portion is good and price is reasonable.

Service was just okay. I understand that they are really busy but  our server barely ask us how we are doing. Service really has to be improved."}
{"text":"Confession: I've only tried their sweet potato fries.

That being said, I am a sweet potato fry connoisseur and have tried a lot of places within the city. A lot. House on Parliament has the best ones, hands down. I usually have the intention of ordering something new every time I go, but I can't help it. I need that orange, yammy, deep fried goodness every time, and I'm too full from the generous helping to order more items off the menu. I'm sure I'll try something else eventually, but for now I'm more than satisfied.

Servers are always very friendly, and the atmosphere is nice and old-timey (kinda reminds me of \"Cheers\" actually). Everyone who's ever been to HOP always has something great to say about the food as well. So make sure you pay a visit, it's one of Cabbagetown's gems!"}
{"text":"House on Parliment is a nice neighborhood spot. They moved semi-recently from a basement space to two floors of town house. The new atmosphere is really great and the wait was not long for a table of five. 

Went here for with a few chicks for celebratory burgers and beers. Loved that I could pick a combo of fries and salad for my choice of side. The burger was huge and nicely cooked. The toppings were fresh and the fries were crispy. Salad was not your average green salad. 

Service was a little awkward. There was a lot of shoulder touching and wordless check-ins but I would still come back, especially to try those English specials."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is one of my favourite places in the neighbourhood. This older Toronto home was transformed into a cozy multi-level restaurant.  The decor is eclectic and homey with a cool vibe.  It's almost always busy and the atmosphere is very relaxed but fun. The staff remember your drinks and are warm and personable which is definitely appreciated. 

The cocktails are awesome, try the Florida Danica it is unreal. As for the food I have no complaints. The portions are great especially with the bangers and mash (boyfriend loved.) We have tried practically all the appetizers and the calamari and smoked salmon are our go-tos. They have some interesting things on the menu to that are unexpected, like the samosas, salmon or the egg dish. I like these options and find it is a nice break from repetitive dips and deep fried platters."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Cabbage Town and came across \"The House On Parliament\" while checking out my new neighbourhood. A girl friend of mine visited a few days later and I decided to take her there - I hadn't been yet. Was I ever hooked! Nice ambiance, excellent food and beverages and excellent prices. What a great combination. I've returned a few times since, and each dish I've had has been a winner. The servers I've had have all been quite good - some excellent. That's why a 4 and not a 5. When I've walked in a couple of times, it took a while to be approached and welcomed. Fix this and be consistent on your servers being awesome, and it will certainly be a 5! 

Having said this, it is one of my favs - the food and prices are just so great!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Went for brunch got the Duck Rillette. Will go again!"}
{"text":"The HOP is the best pub in the city.  The servers are fast and friendly.  The food is excellent.  Order from the specials menu and you will never be disappointed.  And it's all very reasonably priced.

To the people who think they have experienced bad service at the HOP I have a few things to say.  I eat/drink here very often and have never had anything less than excellent service.  However, I do know what some of the complainers are referring to and in response to this I say you get what you give.  If you walk in on a saturday night with a group of six and have to wait for a table it's because IT'S BUSY!  anyways, complain all you want.   Don't come back even! please!  It'll leave more space for me.

Oh and to the reviewer that called cabbagetown sketchy and hoped for gentrification: go back to liberty village.  we don't want or need gentrification.  Cabbagetown is fine as it is."}
{"text":"Wowsers what an amazingly spectacular experience. Best part, totally unexpected. My friend and I randomly chose this restaurant/pub for dinner tonight and I'm certainly glad that we did. I honestly believe I had the best burger EVER tonight. If you ever find yourself at this wonderful establishment (with might I mention equally fabulous service), make sure to order the elk and boar burger. Yummy to the tummy!"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful. Amazing eggs benny.our server, Gabe, was a real hoot and brought the brunch to a new level. The Queen would be proud of this house on parliament"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant. The servers are amazing, the drinks are amazing, and the food is to die for (especially the specials menu). This place feels like home, being comfortable and cared for! Everyone needs to go here at least once...if not, much more!"}
{"text":"Great dependable food and wonderful energy any time of the year day or night. Prepare to be surprised with the quality of the food. Don't miss the Sweet Potato Fries! Comfort food extraordinaire.

The wait staff have got great personalities so be prepared to go with the flow! You never know what will happen but realize that they are committed to you having a great experience. Get to know them and they will look after you brilliantly! If you are grouchy no one wants to serve you anyway!!"}
{"text":"Amazing restobar! Came here for my friend bday and I really didnt expect anything of it. But I already liked the ambiance- cozy, chic, cool - and when I tried all the things I ordered one by one I was increasingly impressed. Got the calamari ($12), the smoked duck cranberry salad (around $12, i forget), and the steak frites (ny steak, garlic butter, fries, $25). Everything was delicious!!! The smoked duck was really special, never had smoked duck and it was quite tasty on the crackers. Also got the Great Lakes craft beer (Toronto, $7 a pint) and it was excellent!!! My friend ordered the mushroom pie which looked so decadent, and likewise she said it was amazing and urged us to try it all. I didnt just to remain polite but i wish i did! But next time i come, i def will!! The prices are not cheap but the food quality justifies it! Would def come back!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! I loved the food, very fresh, good portions, delicious, friendly staff and very nice decoration.  Duck salad, fish and chips and pulled pork sandwich was awesome. I saw their brunches in next tables and i will come to try one of them very soon"}
{"text":"I had not had Kobe beef before and after having the Kobe burger at this pub, I may well be put off it for life. I don't understand when dry and flavorless came at a premium. The waiter recommended I order it medium rare. I'm afraid that if I hadn't I would have had burnt offerings placed on my table. The server went to great lengths to explain to me that the meat had to be cooked to a certain degree so that all the magic fat crystals melted into the meat. Well to cook more than succeeded. If there was any flavor in it when it hit the grill any evidence of it had vanished by the time it reached my plate.
 Beer is good tho. Fire the cook!"}
{"text":"There service has been much better and we've enjoyed many great dinners there since my bad experiences earlier this year.  Not to mention, they've made more effort to get in a 2nd or 3rd round of drinks.  

Unfortunately there wait on tables during the dinner hour hasn't gotten much better.  But it is worth the wait if you have the time."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. They acknowledged us when it was convenient for them, our server was nice, but she was shy and I felt she didn't want to be there and trust me that type of attitude shows. Our food was okay, but what really upset me was I asked for a side caesar salad instead of fries, then when our food came half an hour later it was literally the ends of iceberg lettuce with sauce smeared on it. Totally gross and so unprofessional. After that \"experience\" it was time for me to pay for my table, for three guests it came to $112 with tip (and why should I pay 15-25% for poor service?) I looked at the bill and they charged me $2 for jalapeños, $1 for an extra tomato slice and $2 for that \"caesar\" salad. What an absolute joke. I'm hard on this kind of things because I've been in the service industry before and have worked at highly respected restaurants and know how it works."}
{"text":"HOP has a really nice pub environment with friendly staff. The food portions are fairly large and taste good and the prices are cheap! The calamari appetizer was huge! Only could eat half as my meal! The beer was nice and cold and great variety. When I asked about a type of beer suggestion I would like based on my type I like they marched me to a good one. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are great - much better than typical pub food, but this place is really busy, the staff seem overwhelmed in the space and don't seem to care whether you're there or not.  People tend to build up at the entrance (not because there's a lack of tables, but because they are not attended to quickly enough) and it makes for a claustrophobic and cramped experience upon entry.  My first impression and second impression of them is: they don't need your business and they don't care if you're there or not.  May be better on a mid-week night than the weekend.

Excellent fish and chips.  They did em' good."}
{"text":"FatCat rate HOP as \"best pub in city\". HOP is only place in city where FatCat will wait 40 minutes to get seat.

Things FatCat like
 - Everything - food, people, atmosphere, prices, beer selection.
 - Recommend trying steak, fish and chips, and liver - not all in one meal of course! - but FatCat assume you come back many times because you like HOP as much as FatCat.

Things FatCat not like
 - Nothing -  FatCat think hard, but he think of nothing he not like about HOP.

You thinking \"should I try HOP?\"  Trust FatCat, you be very happy."}
{"text":"Am a local, and love the House. Never been disappointed with their food - their fries are probably the best in TO, and the steak frites is to die for - though I haven't eaten a meal that wasn't delish here.  They have Blanche de Chambly on tap which is also a huge plus - was in Montreal recently and couldn't even find that luxury :) The only downside is that it is a bit of a victim of its success - when it is busy, it is crazy busy - lines out the door waiting for a table, and sometimes a bit of a long wait once you are seated. On a really busy night taking the option to sit upstairs can be a bonus, as the wait staff is up to check on you pretty frequently. Everyone should visit the House at least once while they're in the city!"}
{"text":"Needless to say, we are die hard fans of this place. Sure, the winter would involve some waiting in line on most days, as the patios are closed for the colder weather. But, you know what? Once you're seated. The drinks come. And then the food. And then the desert? You'll never remember how long you were in line for! 

We always walk out feeling that we had gottten GREAT VALUE for our money. 

I must confess though,... the servers are not wearing the chirpy smiles like they used to, for awhile now. We're not sure if they are just too busy? suffering from burnout? But when folks come, it would be nice to be greeted with some positive energy? We don't want to feel like we're bothering you ... or \"making work\" for you ... :)"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. First when it was located downstairs and once every month for the last year.

The good is great for pub food. I love the wings, burgers, pulled pork sandwiches, the mushroom steak pies.. I love everything. 

The servers and bartenders are always awesome. Very friendly and funny. I love the patio section upstairs and outside.

I just wish it wasn't always so god damn busy that it takes forever for ur food to be delivered. Thank goodness for the beers they serve there. 

This place would definitely be a 5 star if my food doesn't always take 45-1hr to come fe when u first order. It's too long for my liking but everything else is amazing."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I'll go back because I like the meat pies. Other than that, I have no complaints about The House, but I wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch with friends, and I have to say I enjoyed the company and the ambiance more than the food. Overall, 1/5 stars for food and service, and 4/5 for ambiance.

They have a front patio and a rooftop patio, which is nice in the summer. The decor inside is nice too. Sadly, the service was beyond slow and the food was subpar. Basically, 3 dishes we tried were DRENCHED in a thick hollandaise sauce that wasn't very good, and overpowered the dishes.

The Shootine was really greasy; I pressed a potato with my fork, and a pool of oil oozed out from it. The ladleful of hollandaise didn't help either. If this had been the only dish I had tried, then I woulda given this place a 1-star.

The scotch eggs sounded very promising (wild boar, pheasant & cognac? wow!) BUT the meat was like regular sauce, and the egg inside was not soft boiled. It was hardboiled to the point the outer ring of the yolk was grey/blue. Again, drenched in hollandaise. The eggs charlotte was the nicer of the 3 dishes, and the fried capers were a nice touch, but then again it was ruined by the sauce. For reference, I'm usually a big fan of hollandaise but theirs was not done properly and they served way too much of it."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Amazing ambience and decor. Beautiful Victorian house. Awesome service and the food looked spectacular and tasted great. Would go back in a heartbeat. Fairly long wait but reasonable for a Saturday night. Were treated with appetizers while we waited. Amazing. Nice beer selection as well. Can't fault them for anything."}
{"text":"Before arriving in Toronto, I had my eye on this place for weeks. After unpacking our stuff at our rental, we took off and headed here. This beautiful old house is located in a quirky neighborhood called Cabbagetown with quite an interesting history. Upon walking in, first thing I noticed was the portrait of Queen Elizabeth the II on her coronation day. Felt like I had a jolly old piece of England there with me. The wood paneling and portraits on the wall remind me of an old Library, but I absolutely loved the essence of it all. 

I fell in love with every single thing that I ate. If this could be my \"Eat, Pray, Love\" plug..this is it. From the Scottish Eggs, Charcuterie Board, Bangers and Mash, Fish and Chips and Sticky Pudding....it was quite divine. I washed this all down with a pint of ale. I'm drooling still thinking about this meal...

The second best part of this experience was talking to one of the owners and the staff. I told them this was my first stop on my Toronto tour and that I wanted really good local recommendations on where to go and what I should see. Everything they recommended, I actually went to see and eat. They didn't disappoint at all. This was my favorite place in Toronto and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here to meet some friends for a drink last week. I loved the ambiance inside (which you will know if you've read any of my other reviews): lots of wood, dim lighting, and a really warm feeling. Plus, lots of London paraphernalia on the walls, which I love!

It had the feel of a neighbourhood local about it, and the service was really good -- attentive and friendly. Also, a major plus for me and others who are not huge beer fans is that it has an interesting, well-priced wine list!

Also, the picture is not representative of its current location. They are actually right next door in an old house, where they've been for a year now (according to our server)."}
{"text":"Where quantity trumps quality. My first time here and I had the prime rib. Mounds of mashed potato, and a huge piece of meat. Not the best tasting but you will leave full. The yorksure pudding was over done and the gravy was black. Service was nonexistent, we had to constantly flag our waitress down. If you want a quiet Sunday dinner this is not the place for you.  Very loud, dark and dingy.  If you want to feel thin, this is the place to go :)"}
{"text":"You know those people who take their babies to pubs? They're total jerks and I'm one of them. I really like this pub because I could be all jerk-like and my baby girl can peacefully sleep since the noise level here is really low, even on a Saturday night! 
This is such a nice, comfy pub! 
I've only had two meals here and I ordered the same dish - the brie sandwich with roasted asparagus and sun-dried tomato pesto. It's a delicious sandwich and the portions are pretty big. The fries are thin and crispy. 
Service is friendly and quick. All in all, I would totally let my daughter get hammered here when she grows up."}
{"text":"I love the HOP! Its been my local for over 10 years and in that time the service has been excellent as has the food. Always consistent, fresh ingredients, reasonable prices and hits the spot!

A great first date place but I recommend the front or upstairs patio or front/ middle part of the restaurant as the back room can get loud and something about the acoustics can make it hard for some people to hear.

Best Pub in the neighborhood... where everybody know your name...and their always glad you came....

They don't do reservations and there is often a lineup at dinnertime so be prepared... it generally moves quick though."}
{"text":"We live in the west-end and regularly make trips out to Cabbagetown simply to go to The House On Parliament for dinner and a just a great night out. The regular menu is fantastic and they always have an interesting and delicious daily menu. Portions are big and we've never been anything but happy with the quality. Their beer list on tap is extensive with both local favourites and surprising imports, plus always a good cider.
One reason to make it out here is for the staff, who always go that extra mile to make you feel at home. It's our neighbourhood pub across the city."}
{"text":"Great pub. The beer selection is pretty good, and I quite enjoy the atmosphere, especially the upstairs patio. Good, friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance , great menu , reasonable pricing . Had a great time there and will be back!"}
{"text":"The staff can be quite rude and abrupt, they are good servers but lack compassion, I won't be back"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Split a few dishes (bison burger, steak and mushroom pie, mahi mahi with risotto) and all were really good, as were the sides. The food was filling and reasonably priced for the quality. The servers were friendly and helpful. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The House on Parliament is one of the best pubs in Toronto. It's a staple for Cabbagetown locals and I guarantee your first visit won't be your last.
The new space is modern gastro-pub style and the food reflects the new diggs.
The waitstaff are fast and friendly, providing just the right amount of attentiveness. 
Overall great value for your money. I'm hooked and I bet you will be too."}
{"text":"For such a sketch area this place is nice! 
Perhaps because it is a little hidden, walking down the street you might miss it or not think much about It but don't be scares go in, it's nice! 
We had large group (10+) drinking at a condo near by when we were getting hungry and running out of booze, called them up to see if the kitchen was open. She said till 1 and it being 12:20 ish we rushed over and made our food orders. Drinks were reasonable price ( 20$ish a pitcher) staff was friendly, and the crowd was mature!"}
{"text":"The House on Parliament is by far, the best gastopub you will find in Toronto. My regular spot for brunch, lunch or dinner, I've always had a great dining experience.

5 stars for:
Food is always delicious & as you order it (half salad/half fries) 
Service is fast & efficient, the Servers have bubbly & friendly personalities, they actually look at you with a smile
Ambiance is warm & accommodating with wood floors & comfortable seating
Beer selection is varied, servers are knowledgeable and even gave us a few to taste before we ordered a pint"}
{"text":"FatCat reminded me of this place. After reading some of his seriously great reviews I thought... I should go back to HOP. And after a nice bike ride today, we did.

This place does some serious business. It was pretty packed, but we were able to get a table inside right away. Ambiance is great and it truly feels like a proper pub complete with great pub grub and loads of beers on tap. 

We ordered 2 Caesars, the Posh Ploughman's (I LOVE ME a Ploughman's Lunch) and the Scotch Eggs. Caesars were okay. My Ploughman's lunch arrived and it was a wonderful selection including a triple cram brie, aged cheddar and a really nice semi creamy blue. Pickled beets, carrot and a nice fruit and mustard seed compote. Smoked Chorizo and salami with a little green salad and a baguette. The perfect mixture of nibblies!

In fact we had severe food jealousy while watching all the delicious looking plates coming out of the kitchen.

Unfortunately, my boyfriend's Scotch Eggs did not come at the same time as my food. Apparently they were mis ordered, but the server was very nice, placing and order for another and comp-ing the first one. I shared my Ploughman's lunch with him until it arrived.

The Scotch Eggs here are WONDERFUL. Topped in hollandaise and truly decadent. We were both in agreement that they were worth waiting for.

I probably would have given HOP 5 stars but they weren't so great about checking on drinks and seeing if we wanted another. That was really the only fault I could find. Had my food not been share-able, it would have been annoying that the server mixed things up, but in the end it was all fine. We really enjoyed ourselves and will without a doubt be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff are friendly and service is great. It's one of the best pubs for food. They have patios outside and on the rooftop. It's always packed but you never have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Thank goodness we found ourselves in the neighbourhood whilst hungry for brunch - this Pub delivered what's probably the best eggs florentine we've had in Toronto so far. The egg poutine dish was also tasty but very heavy. Cute decor, a nice patio, and great organic dark roast coffee too."}
{"text":"A bit of a wait tonight to get seated, which is tricky in the tight space available at the door, but the staff is reassuring and interactive to keep the pace up and seat you asap. 
We ate primarily off the specials menu which was tasty large portions and hot fresh out of the kitchen with very little wait.  
Reasonably affordable bill, and cosy atmosphere rounded out the experience nicely."}
{"text":"The House on Parliament is far enough away from the financial district and Yorkville that the prices are quite reasonable, if not cheap. The food on the other hand is excellent. I had the squash ravioli topped with pancetta ($17) in a cream sauce. The bacon was crispy, lean, and very flavourful. It blended perfectly with the squash. The wine list is short, but very respectable. If you're looking for a bite on a budget, you can't go wrong with the House."}
{"text":"Would I come again? Yep.

It's pub food, but it's great pub food done well every single time. I had the fish and chips ($18) and you get huuuuge pieces of fish, fried perfectly. 

They have a great area on the roof that's shaded/covered but still gets a lot of natural light, keeping it bright. It's a great place to eat in the summer. My office also came here during the winter, where we had a room to ourselves with two long tables. For a party of about 25 people, the service was quick and we had no problems with our orders. 

It's a great, laid-back, and casual spot that pairs the comfort food with a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. The food was good, and not too pricey. I had the fish and savoury bread pudding, which was very satisfying, and something I'd never tried prior. I also had the flourless chocolate cake with ice cream and it was delicious, but I'd like to note that the ice cream tasted a bit freezer burnt, but everything else was delicious, so I'm willing to look beyond the one slip up. It was pretty busy, but we only waited about 15 minutes for a table. The place was also packed with tables and pretty loud, but I enjoyed it. The noise level made it so that you didn't have to hear the intimate conversations of those around you.
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and nice beer selection.  The atmosphere is great. Love the peanut butter pie."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places I have dined at in the city.

Casual, relaxed pub-like atmosphere, amazing staff, and top-notch food.

I went with a girlfriend that has been coming here for years, and I can see why."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, great atmosphere, awesome menu with a good amount of options, and most importantly, great beer selection.  This place is pretty much perfect."}
{"text":"I've given the House on Parliament hundreds of my hard-earned dollars over the past couple of years and I'm like, yeah!!  Cuz, goodness always happens in return. 

Parliament and Carlton / Cabbagetown is a weird hodge-podge of gross and fancy.  HoP is nestled in there taking both refined and casual as their thing!  The decor is muted, comfy and British, not trying to prove anything. Every last square inch is not stamped with the Queen's seal nor wrought with Empire nostalgia. So, you won't feel colonized.

The menu changes, seeming to rotate given the day of the week, but is always delectable and well-presented.  They are really lucky to have whoever it is in that kitchen!!  I've had almost everything on their menu from the Ploughman's lunch to steak to bangers to fish to Cobb salad to eggs Benedict and none disappoints.  Everything tastes like one of the very best versions you've had of it in the city.  Food is portioned thoughtfully and you are guaranteed to eat well.

Their drinks are plenty on tap, come fast and are well-priced.  Gin martinis are well-made.

The service can be spotty--especially when they are busy or when you don't get a veteran server. They kind of don't care, because they know you'll be back.  But the infraction is never mega.  Upstairs' seating has terrible acoustics and sounds like 15 people shouting in a kid's bedroom.  I've been to private events there and it's not a good set up for that--especially for sound.  Try to sit on the ground floor, where they don't forget about you and the ambiance is much nicer.  I've never sat on the patio(s?) so don't know that part.

Go!!  Though, you may have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Awesome food awesome service and awesome atmosphere. Bring a bunch of good friends n youre bound to have a good time here!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Great ambiance, good service. Wasn't expecting the flavours as the menu looked like your typical British pub fare. Don't judge a book by its cover. You must try the sticky toffee pudding! Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a very busy Sunday. We were seated pretty quickly and were served right away. 

They had several kinds of eggs Benedict and $5 mimosas. Yes!! The eggs Benny were very tasty and came with either home fries or a salad. I can't resist home fries and I was rewarded for my weakness. They were basically halved small potatoes, crispy and fried on the outside, soft and hot on the inside. The only disappointment was the mimosa, which was made with oj from concentrate. Sacrilege!!

Service was friendly and the breakfast was filling. A great brunch in a beautiful converted Victorian home."}
{"text":"Came for brunch yesterday and enjoyed.  I had the Eggs Charlotte and my friend had Beau's Breakfast.  Both were pretty good.  Our waitress was attentive and did coffee refills frequently and was very quick.  I enjoyed my meal and my friend enjoyed hers. 

I have a brunch-wish that never seems to come true:

Brunch providers will stop making big, boring salads as a side.  There has to be something else!

Overall, the food was good but it did not wow me for brunch.  Also, my tea was not piping hot so it didn't last but that's just me being picky.

I don't live nearby but if I did I'm sure I'd come here often.  Since I do not live nearby I don't think I'll go out of my way."}
{"text":"We went here on Friday night for drinks and were looked after very quickly. It seemed like a popular neighborhood bar. I ordered for 506 Carlton Cocktail which was too sweet. Also we had to remind them that we had ordered a dessert. The flourless chocolate cake was good, worth a try.

Overall the experience was average."}
{"text":"So - how have I never noticed this place in the 2.5 years of living in the area?  This wonderful gastropub is but 10 minutes from my door and I've always complained about the lack of decent, affordable food in my neighbourhood.  This place has just fixed that.

Like - The prices for one thing.  Everything was affordable from the beer to the mains, and the quality for price is almost unbeatable in the area.  Daily menus contain specials as well as their regular fare.  My pork belly special was plentiful and delicious.

Dislike - The crowds - although really, I'm being selfish.  Clearly this gem attracts large crowds who also want to flock to it for the good food.  Staff at the bar were friendly, server at the table wasn't the greatest.  I felt like I was a constant annoyance and someone who needed to rush out for the next person.

Overall, I will definitely be back (and likely soon!) to this place, especially if I need to bring out-of-towners to see what good Toronto food is all about."}
{"text":"I do like this place quite a bit, but it's a bit over hyped.  Everyone raves about the food, but the food is really just OK.  Maybe it's what I've ordered, but it doesn't seem anything special to me.  In fact, a couple things I've had there are a bit funny tasting.  The brie and veggie sandwich, for example, tastes kind of ....off.  The service is iffy too, especially since they moved to their new location.  It can be hard to flag down your waitstaff to order or get your bill.

Not to be totally negative though.  They have a great beer selection.  The new space is cozy and inviting.  The decor has all these awesome old maps that i'm totally a sucker for.  It really is a fun place, but just not the \"best pub in the city\" and it doesnt have the \"best food of any pub in the city.\" Let's not go overboard here."}
{"text":"A place with a pretty sweet patio and pretty awesome pub food. The food portions are huge and reasonably priced, and best of all, very well cooked and prepared!

I had the steak and mushroom pie with mashed potatoes and it was so food. Flaky pie crust filled to the brim with steak pieces and mushroom (no gravy - it was more of a dry filling).

My friend ordered the fried chicken sandwich and I tried a few bites. Decent, but not as good as the pie imo! BUT the fries that came with the sandwich...incredible. Some of the best fries ever. I'd come back to this place just to sit on the patio and order a basket of fries."}
{"text":"- Great service (friendly service)
- Great food (Pulled pork was awesome)
- The fries are to die for (hickory sticks on steroids)
- Great home made mayo and hot sauce 
- Decent price"}
{"text":"I've been there 100 times+ and never a bad meal!  They make the simplest meal a gourmet treat. Steak sandwich with Stilton, Lamb curry or a Kobe burger...you name it, they nail it. Great service and nice friendly vibe."}
{"text":"A few friends from work and I went for a pre theatre dinner and drink.  We walked into a welcome sight.  Warm lighting, comfortable seating and friendly service.  We were seated quickly and the after work unwind was immediate.  We all ordered different but equally perfect meals.  A  gourmet gri?led cheese, the club sandwich and I ordered a Spinach goat cheese salad with grilled chicken.  It was not done the standard ways but had added touches and ingredients that surprised us!  I would have given 5 stars but our time trying to pay the bills was long and felt like an exercise.  It was a full house but I think, if you can serve up such a great experience, go all the way and plan for your guests to leave happily and quickly without stress.  I will recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Went to the House On Parliament on a date this week, and overall I was disappointed.  Been there a few times and the food is nice, but it's got to bad things going for it.  Some (not all) of the staff are a little cold.  Had the same waitress a couple of times, and she's a not friendly and doesn't really seem to care.  Drinks were empty and had to wait/ask for refills.  The other problem is that it's too crowded, too many tables,  People had to squeeze through tables to sit down and because of this crowdedness its way too loud.  I'd pay a bit more money if they loose a table or two.  Trying to get to know someone was hard, people have to almost yell to each other to talk, which means you have to speak louder also.  I left with almost a sore throat.   Parking is paid on street only."}
{"text":"Asked out waiter what is a good blind beer?  He said \"I don't know, I just drunk Keith's \" know your beers buddy. Ordered dinner- not once did he stop to ask if it was ok or need anything. Walked by us 10 + plus times - that's horrible. Had a waitress drop our food off and took our money. The July time she said a thing to us was thank you (that's after I paid). 
No personality from the wait staff. I am so upset with this place each time I go there( and have been for 5+ years) I hope it gets better the place has great food and the atmosphere is great. But the staff suck. I get better service at McDonald's. So I tipped them 5 bucks. Personally I think that was to much. To the manager - please give your staff lessons on how to be a great server. The harder you work the more of a tip you get, plus those staff are a poor reflection of your restaurant/pub. Last time I was there you served us raw hamburgers( after asking for well done ) I hope I hear some feed back about the service. That's if you care !!"}
{"text":"The FARC's were due for a disappointing outing and unfortunately this one came at the at the hands of my previously beloved HOP. 

HOP you were disappointing last night! In search of comfort and good food, the FARC's headed out to the HOP to imbibe, chat and eat. Fortunately, the good conversation was present as always but that only served to fill in the dreadful gap between ordering and receiving our pub grub. It was a lengthy wait and it could have been eased by better drink service or a status report, I think I must have shot Christine a few 'where's our food dude?' looks a few times during our chat!

Once arrived, it was nothing special. The FARCS engaged in a discerning discussion over  \"sweaty pastry\" for the steak and mushroom pie lacked a flaky crusty and seemed on the verge of imploding from steam, excessive liquids or good ol' plain microwave treatment. The braised pulled pork sandwich was delicious, the charred onions were a nice touch and the pulled pork was tender however the bread was a tad on the spongy side. Methinks a more softer bun would have been a more appropriate vehicle for the pulled pork. 

All in all, quite a disappointing outing for the FARC tonight-we'll be looking to rebound next week!"}
{"text":"Initially I was excited to walk into this place, it looked local and cozy and the beer selection was pretty sweet. But first impressions can be deceiving.

We had a party of 10 and walked in, asking if they had room to seat us, as we realized it was a Friday night and it's not always possible to seat parties that large . The server who looked a few drinks in the tank already, suggested we could sit outside and then proceeded to raise his voice about 10 notches and shout out how he'd have to card all of us before he gave us anything.

Which was fine because the youngest amongst us was 23, and we all had valid government id. 

The bartender/server must have assumed we left after that statement because he came outside and started badmouthing us, due to our age, to the table closest to the door. Then he realized we were all sitting about 5 feet away. 

He then got really gruff and told us we couldn't move the furniture, which I apologized for as I didn't know and he told us he could fit us outside...which only worked if we put the tables together. He then hemmed and hawed and ignored us for awhile while we sat bewildered wondering what the hell was going on. Eventually he came back and meticulously carded every person, finding not a flaw in any of our, valid, legal identifications. The birthday person was really insulted by this treatment and flat out asked him why he had approached us like this in the first place.

His answer really disappointed me. 
\"We cater to a very specific clientele here\"
To which our question was \"And what is that?\"
The answer being \"If you have an issue, just leave.\"

So yeah, jerkwad/snobby/drunk, who knows. Our group was a bunch of mid twenty somethings JUST like the other people on the patio. 

At first I thought he was just intimidated by the group size, but as we asked him if he could accommodate us in the first place, he should have said flat out no if that was so.

Anyway, after turning the corner to another bar and having a significantly better time, I told the bartender at the second bar about this story and when he told me he'd heard this story several times already, I wasn't really surprised. Not planning on going back, there are hundreds of other bars out there, no matter how great the frites are supposed to be."}

My gf and I had a great night and definetly coming back!!"}
{"text":"I was in The House of Parliament twice. 
I absolutely loved it!!!
Let's start. My first time was one month ago, I decided to go for lunch.  I got my table on the patio. Nice and very cozy small patio.
Good selection a beer. I ordered Hacker Pshor Lager (German beer) and I took special Surf&Turf.
My meal was so delicious!!! Right cocked meat (I ordered medium rare), garlic shrimps on top and chipotle butter. For sides I got homemade fries and horta. Bill was 33$ included tax
Second time was few weeks ago. 
I ordered Gaspacho soup and Salmon steak with chick peas veggy salad.
Gaspacho was cold with a lot of veggies, spicy , served with sourcream and bread with butter. Salmon was perfectly cocked and salad was very light, fresh and testy.
Service was very good, friendly, positive)
I will definitely back again!

{"text":"Our favourite place! The food here is outstanding, and they have a diverse selection of beers and wines. We will always come back! (Especially on Friday's when the special is Chicken & Waffles.) Love! Love! Love! :-)"}
{"text":"Went here with a culinary friend food was amazing. Very busy tight quarters the only problem I had with the restaurant is all the smokers crowd in the front door gross but I know that's not the restaurants fault perhaps if they had some signs not to smoke right at the entrance they would help the people with lung and breathing issues. Did you know smokers are stupid when they smoke in front of doorways or next to no smoking signs. Move down the street."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was honestly just looking for somewhere to drink, but when I got inside I felt so comfortable with the cozy ambiance! They have yummy cocktails and a decent selection of beers. Haven't tried the food, but I can definitely say this is a great little spot to have a few."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. Nice decor inside. The 2-seater tables are tiiiny. Makes the plates look gigantic. Service was quick. The food for brunch was good. Their homefries were well made and they had some good brunch items which I haven't tried before. Prices are reasonable $12-15 range for brunch. For some reason the coffee was delicious. Better than the average brunch spots I've had. Nice place to drink as well. Their bar is small but they seem to have a good variety of alcoholic beverages on tap. I liked the decor around the bar too. They have an upstairs space if you have a larger party to entertain."}
{"text":"Always busy here. Food hasn't changed in years. Consistently decent with moments of bad. Service is not great. Seems these old fogies suffer memory loss from time time. Hey ladies, how about asking if I'd like a beverage with my meal?"}
{"text":"Ce pub a du très bien et du très mauvais!

Commencons par le très mauvais! Je commande un Ginger Ale sans glace et la serveuse me ramène la cannette et un verre rempli de glace donc je lui dis que je ne veux pas de glace et là elle commence à me tenir tête comme quoi la cannette n'est pas froide, et pas avec le sourir! Donc je lui demande moins de glace, et la j'avais juste l'impression de la faire chier.... c'est pour cela que j'ai mis que j'ai connu mieux car pour moi c'est inadmissible de parler comme ça à un client!

Il y a quand meme du bon dans ce pub! déjà le cadre est très agréable, un peu trop bruyant mais on s'y fait, et la nourriture! Pour 13$ j'ai eu l'impression de voyager en Europe! juste Whahouuuuuu"}

{"text":"Food was good, service was ok, nothing extraordinary, but nice in general... However, the fact they charged extra for mayo (I ordered fries) really annoyed me... Like, seriously?"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite place! I've had fantastic food every single time. The service is also amazing! The girls are hilarious! For a good time and great food. You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Did somebody say \"ROOFTOP PATIO\"?!?!?!?
Yeah, I did.... Right ^^ there. They have a newly installed rooftop patio with beautiful wood wall encasement and matching tables just in time for summer.

I've come back many times since my original review for what I still believe to be the best pulled pork sandwich in Toronto, but also for what could arguably be the club chicken sandwich in Toronto based on the solid ratio of bacon/chicken/bun (an amazing focaccia meets panini type of breaded surroundings), and its accompanying huge pile of thin cut fries with amazing garlic aioli. 
My ladyfriend always chooses something on the daily specials and it never disappoints, and their beer selection always has something interesting and craft brewed to choose from. 

Any other praise I'm sure will suffice from the previous review.
Get on it."}
{"text":"Visited this place one evening on a trip to Toronto with my bf. It's a beautiful and cozy restaurant situated inside a Victorian-esque house. It was already pretty busy when we arrived, but we were seated quickly. It was a tight fit in the dining room area we sat in, which was essentially the front hall past the house's entrance. 

The service was very friendly and worked at a moderate pace. We didn't wait too long for drinks or food which was a huge plus. I ordered the nachos and my bf picked the chicken quesadilla. He asked to substitute some ingredients, but the waiter informed us they were premade and unable to be changed. This seemed pretty odd to us... Premade quesadillas? I thought it was unfair as well to anyone who may have an allergy to one of the ingredients. He decided to order it anyway despite not being able to make substitutions. Our food arrived soon after, but was incredibly disappointing. 

The nachos were covered in thick stalks of scallion, huge tomato chunks and a few jalapeño slices. The chips were in a large pile with melted cheese only on the top layer. Not a good look. Even the guacamole was brown and unappetizing. At least the roasted corn salsa was delicious when I piled it on the chips. The quesadilla was lukewarm inside and not crispy whatsoever. It tasted like they mixed the cheese and corn salsa from my nachos with chicken, stuffed it into a tortilla and microwaved it. The French fries it came with were crispy and delicious though. 

We probably wouldn't come back although we enjoyed the ambiance and service. Our meal was just too mediocre but we were glad we gave it a try anyway."}
{"text":"Discovered this place through my boyfriend and his family last year. The most important thing about this place is that they provide delicious food, with very good portion (actually fills up the boys' and men's belly) at a very reasonable price. 

A year ago, I ordered mussels and fries from their daily special menu (unfortunately I don't have a picture of it). This time, I got the 1) steak and frites - 10oz peppercorn crusted AAA NY strip loin, pinot noir, chalot & herb butter, grilled corn and frites. Cooked medium rare, to my request and liking. I usually don't like fries, but this time, I enjoyed it with their mayo and ketchup. 
My boyfriend ordered the 2) Fancy Bangers & mash  grilled locally produced sausage, balsamic marinated charred onions, red skin mashed potato, seasonal vegetables, gravy & mustard grains. 

We both enjoyed our food both times we went, plus they have a good service! We'll definitely go again.

Food: 5/5
Price: 4.8/5
Service: 4.5/5
Cleanliness: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful. We went there for lunch and three dishes were ordered between my roomate and I: the smoked salmon with crostini, gaspacho soup of the day, and the baked brie and veggie panini with a side of the spinach salad. These were all great-- I don't even like gaspacho, but theirs was so tasty that my spoon just kept wandering over when no one was looking.

The smoked salmon with the crostini was a little on the messy side, but tasted really good. I absolutely loved the brie and veggie sandwich and was so impressed that they allowed me to have the spinach salad as a side in place of the baby greens. It was a nice day and we had the tiny table right beside the window-- actually the table was inconveniently small but it was a toss up between a normal one or to be beside the window."}
{"text":"My Local - I love this place. Probably the best gastropub in Toronto. Great food, cool vibe and always a good time. Everything on the menu is awesome."}
{"text":"I visited the HOP when I was in town for NXNE with friends in a band. After finishing up the gig, we (the band I was with and the band they performed with) wanted to go grab a bite to eat and HOP it was. The experience honestly couldn't have been better. 20 people, give or take, tromped in wanting to sit together and the accommodated  us immediately on a busy Saturday night! The server was amazing- such a friendly guy with great beer recommendations and definitely handled us all very well.

The food was hot and fresh and no one could stop talking about how much they loved their meal. 

We've already made a promise to ourselves about the next show in Toronto- we will definitely stop by the House On Parliament!"}
{"text":"First of all the service was not that great. I have been here before and that time it was fine but they  will definitely  judge you on your appearance. The second I returned  it wasn't  very busy we got seat right when we walked in.  It took about 10mins for us to ask us what we want to drink and to give us a menu we were ready to order took us a while for them to take our order. When I was ordering I went second I wasn't even done ordering and he was was like OK and walked away. For the waiting time it was about 40mins but  there was only two of us. 

Now for the food this was a pretty big disappointment. I got the fish and chips because I was remembered how good it was but when It came there was so much oil literally soaking the fries and there was so much batter on the fish it should have been called batter and chips  and the sauce that came with the fries it was just mayo and way to much pepper  and the tartar sauce was mayo and pickels,  both of the sauces lacked flavor. And the whole dish was an overall disappointment. My friend got one in the items from the brunch menu the poached eggs where complete cooked and her fruits were warm which made them mush and the house fries in my opinion are very weird 

During this whole time no one came to check up on what we thought about the food and how we are doing.  This  visit has made me iffy  about my return."}
{"text":"This place is truly fantastic.

The food is reasonably priced and delicious.
The service is great.
The atmosphere is wonderful -- decorated historically with plenty of original fixtures. 
The beer menu is pretty fantastic and there are a ton of other drinks for non-beer drinkers. 

You should go. It's well worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, good ambience, and friendly service = solid 4 stars

A trendy gastropub that serves decent food at a reasonable price. Everything on the menu (as far as I remember) was under $20 except for steak frites. I had chicken quesadilla with market salad on the side. The salad was fresh and perfectly dressed, The quesadilla had a generous amount of  chicken breast and other toppings. My boyfriend had a steak & wild mushroom pie. He really enjoyed it. The pie was packed with steak and mushroom. It was such a comforting dish. 

Overall, one of the best places to eat in this area. We will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This has the freshest fairest priced food in the city. Haven't had one dish I wouldn't recommend and the service is always fast and efficient, will gladly empty my wallet any time I stop by."}
{"text":"Loved it here! 

Went with a friend for pre-theatre dinner (Acting Up Stage's FALSETTOS, at a new venue in the 'hood: Daniels Spectrum... review to come...). 

It was my chum's recommendation - I had heard of it, but never been myself. 

I actually drove past it three times because it is LITERALLY A HOUSE. ON PARLIAMENT. I was looking for a restaurant sign with that name. Duh, Rosie. HOUSE. So be warned. 

Everyone on staff is super friendly and laid back. No uniforms, and it seemed to be seat yourself. There are a few different levels to dine on (washrooms are upstairs).

A respectable wine list and beer selection for sure. As for myself, I had two Cosmopolitans and they were great! As others have mentioned, it is definitely an older clientele (we're late 20s and we were the youngest people there).

Good menu - something for everyone, I would imagine.

I had the Baked Brie & Veggie Panini (Brie, portabello mushroom, wilted spinach and sundried tomato tapenade with roasted garlic aioli on toasted panini). It was really, really, really good. I could only eat half - I wanted to eat it all, though! It tasted a bit like pizza somehow, in a good way! Had a (HUGE) side greens salad with the house vinaigrette which was simple and wonderful. 

He had a \"Kobe Burger' which I don't think is even on the menu! He eats here all the time and it's one of his faves, clearly!

We also shared an order of the \"hand-cut frites with roasted garlic mayo\". The frites were amazing, the mayo so-so. We both preferred ketchup like true Canadians!

It is LOUD. We arrived at 5pm (show was at 7pm) and by the time we left conversation was getting difficult. 

Service was fantastic - fast, confident, efficient and friendly. Love.

Prices are at least $4-5 less than you'd pay at most similar establishments, which I love. Go, Cabbagetown!

HOP is comfortable, easy, tasty and fun. It's not the best pub or restaurant in the city, but it's not trying to be. The food, the service, the decor and the atmosphere are all definitely a few steps above your average Toronto pub! 

You know they have a loyal following because probably 50% of the people who arrived while we were there were given high fives or greeted by name (and I'm assuming they then headed to their \"regular\" tables). I like that. 

\"Sometimes you wanna go
Where everybody knows your name
And they're always glad you came...\""}
{"text":"I recently went back there with Evelyn W. and needed to update this review. I again had the red wine jus poutine from before but also ate some of Evelyn W.'s poutine, plain poutine and it was one of the best I've had in the city. Gravy not too thick, mixed types of cheese, not curds. Lovely. Just sayin."}
{"text":"This is one of the most authentic British Pubs I've found so far in Toronto. The moment you walking in, it's like walking into a London! Every time I've walked in, it has always been lively and full of energy. They have a great selection of craft beers on tap for any beer enthusiast, and some great seasonal menu items. There service has always been amazing and the staff is extremely knowledgeable. 

They have a seasonal menu which never disappoints but my favorite has to be the Tourtière. A buttery flakey pork pie served with a tomato jalapeno chutney and roasted garlic mash, AMAZING.

If you're ever in the neighbourhood and you're looking for a gastropub to try, look no further! Though you may have a long way for a table."}
{"text":"Two & half measly stars.  

So the FARC's were prowling around Parliament St. this evening to grab some libations and a nosh at the HOP only to discover that this must have been FPG night in Cabbagetown.  FPF is my acronym for Flub the Pub Grub because that is exactly what happened at the HOP.  

Deanna and I decided to meet up after she put in her sweat equity at a spin class.  Hell the girl musta been down a few pints of water and was badly in need of topping up so it was the HOP for us.  It was packed and for a Monday night that says something about the place.  I hear the taps are great but not being a beer drinker I can't really say.  They are packing them in on Parliament Street but for the life of me I just can't believe it's for the food.

We ordered Deanna's much beloved Steak & Mushroom pie and the braised Pulled Pork Sandwich topped with a half charred onion and fries.  I bet you we waited almost 40 minutes for our food.  At no time did the server say anything to us and we couldn't seem to get his attention.  When the food finally did show up I must say I was disappointed.  In the car on the way home I told Deanna I thought the pastry of the steak pie was sweaty and actually so was the baguette of my sandwich.  

So here's my take on what I think happened.  I think someone forgot our order or it either sat and got completely cold and ultimately some lamo assed moron in the kitchen nuked the pie and the sandwich because they were steaming but the fries were cold.   You know how buns get all \"spongy\" when you nuke them and they are chewy, almost impossible to get through, tantamount to eating a cleansing sponge sans the soap.  This is basically what we got.  So much for all the hype about the HOP being a gastro pub.  

If I were looking for a buzzing place to grab a beer and a basket of sweet potato fries then the HOP would probably be a great spot.  Past that I wouldn't give it much thought as a food destination."}
{"text":"I'm a regular since 09' and I have NEVER had a bad meal. How many resturants can I say that about? Not too damn many mister."}
{"text":"This place was a bit dirty, old and grimy when they where up the street but after moving down a little the new location is great! More room, cleaner and a better atmosphere all together. There is seating in the front and bar area which makes you feel like its a place to chill and have a few drinks and then towards the back more seating appropriate for dining. Great selection of beers and the food is never a disappointment! Service is hit and miss depending on who you get and how busy the place is. They have Sunday Prime Roast that comes with an amazing dessert! Their samosas are huge and delicious! Their vegetarian panini is so packed full of flavor for a sandwich that has no meat.  I heard their wings and sweet potatoes fries are a must try, although I have yet to try. The food is a bit on the pricey side but because its so good I understand why they charge the way they do, plus the portions are quite a decent size."}
{"text":"I've been here probably 20 times. Almost every single time I have had either a good or amazing meal.  I've tried probably 70% of their regular menu and always try the special menu when it is appealing.  The pulled pork sandwich is killer.  Their hamburger is amazing.  I don't see why people love the Kobe burger.  The regular burger tastes better.   I call the Kobe burger the show off burger.  Its just to show off.  Meat loaf is amazing.  The pie with gravy is great.  Wings are pretty good.  Fish and chips amazing.  Now on to the only disappointment.  The chicken sandwich.  Re-name that to a flavorless door wedge sandwich.   I'm expecting a breaded chicken full of flavours,  with slaw and all the good stuff.  Nah.  Its not often I say I like my breasts flat, but for this sandwich you need flat breast.  Not a door wedge.  Also needs a kick.  Love this place too much.  Good job everyone!"}
{"text":"i had brunch here on their patio and it was decent.  i had an eggs benedict and i cant seem to remember too much about it.  i dont remember disliking it, so perhaps thats where the three comes from.  i was also sitting right beside two smokers so i was actually eating that too.  brutal.  i look forward to the days when smoking isnt allowed on patios anymore.  ive had better brunches but i do like the patio itself and the old look of the place is nice.  id come here for a different meal just because its come recommended."}
{"text":"This pub has great food, and good micro-brew selections.

The HOP serves an excellent Sunday Prime Rib Roast dinner for something like 15-16 bucks, and it also follows with bread pudding for dessert, which was the best bread and butter pudding that I've ever had.

However, I find that some of the staff here can be little snotty. The service is always efficient in terms of food and drink, however, I find at times, they can be quite cocky, and condescending.  I have been told that it is because I am not a local/regular. F#CK that attitude.

I would be giving the HOP 5 stars, if not for the ego's at times.

{"text":"Love this place! The ambiance is cozy, the menu is vast but everything on it is delicious. Definitely my favorite brunch spot."}
{"text":"House on Parliament is one of my favourite pubs in the city, and definitely a top stop in Cabbagetown.

The food is delicious and the servings are generous.  Their fries are fresh cut daily and are some of the best I've ever had, a great accompaniment to your burger or sandwich.  Speaking of burgers and sandwiches, you basically can't go wrong with any of these.  The veggie burger is hearty and loaded with sprout-goodness, the back bacon sandwich is succulent and not too heavy, even with the ten slices of bacon that I counted in it once, yes 10, even the waitress was surprised.

The specials are always delicious.  My friend and I indulged in a bison burger with sweet potato fries (around $15 maybe) and were drooling from how good it was.

The patio is a nice size, but since it's sunken, doesn't get much sun.  Smoking is only permitted on the east-side of the patio.  Arrive early for dinner, as seating is limited and it fills up fast.  Not very appropriate for large groups, though they will accommodate if it's not busy at the time.  The setting is cozy, and definitely gives off the charm of a real English pub."}
{"text":"House on Parliament is a fantastic haunt. The beer is good and the food is great

Emily is the best server....what fantastic service. 6 thumbs up"}
{"text":"Very good food! This surprised me, as I was expecting your typical bar fare. But the ingredients tasted fresh, and was really well made. You don't typically see things like risotto on a bar menu! The atmosphere was casual and not loud. Was a big group of about 10 people, and there seemed to be lots of room (although I think we went there fairly early). The staff was very friendly even before we went through all the wine they had!"}
{"text":"Went here for post-theatre dinner the other night. Amazing! Really well done pub food (I had a fantastic Scotch Egg with arugula salad, my friend had Fish & Chips) and open late - we got there around 11 pm and were thrilled to find the kitchen open. Lovely cozy atmosphere, great to find in a time when so many old-school pubs have decided to \"upscale\" and try too hard to look \"trendy.\" Will definitely be back to try the Sticky Toffee Pudding - my friend raved about it but we were full after dinner (portions are generous) and turning into pumpkins at midnight."}
{"text":"Great Place!!! I like different pubs and beer places, but these place is on the top of my list. I've been there only once, but only because I live too far. Great food, different beer and good people - especially if you are aware of the neighbourhood you do not have that great expectations. Recommend to everybody."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, ambiance is great, one of the best pubs in the city, but a big shout out to their amazing team that delivers superb service, I do have to commend one person the girl who keeps the line up moving and does it so efficiently, one of the things we love is whenever we come in we are always greeted by a big smile, and given constant updates on where we are in terms of sitting down. But mostly we really love the fact that she is so calm when it's crazy busy, and we have seen her given hugs to many customers or they always touch her and thank her on their way out. And the rest of the team always working so well, smiling and always looking after everyone also. Love it."}
{"text":"While they have their hiccups in their service especially when it gets crowded, the experience in general is pretty good. The food is your standard pub fair with a few specials thrown in the mix.
You can confidently order just about anything and it should taste great for the most part. They have a wide assortment of beer on tap as well. The atmosphere is just great especially during patio season. The service is also quite good when they are not too busy but there are hiccups whenever there's a rush.
Definitely a go to pub in the area and overall just a great place to grab a drink and chill."}
{"text":"Decent enough neighborhood pub on the edges of Cabbagetown. Draws a very urban older \"don't call us yuppies\" crowd. The kind of people who still ride a bike to work at age 40 and WILL try to make you feel bad about it. Owing to the olderness of the crowd, you'll find it hard to squeeze in after 7 pm. We old people want our beers and be home in bed by 10 pm on a Saturday night. 

Services is good, friendly, and prompt. It CAN be loud, loud, loud. Tables are small and you're intimately close to neighboring tables. Those planning on firebombing  Ernst Zündel's home in Cabbagetown will need to keep their voices down. 

Food portions are large. The fries are great. Nice selection of beers on tap. 

I'd be back if it weren't for the noise."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing. Great service, ambience and the food is to die for! Great place for every occasion."}
{"text":"Great Pub style food! I can honestly say that I'd probably come back over and over just for a bowl of their Onion Soup! Super melty after being baked for a while and the bread inside has soaked up all that delicious brothy flavour. I love trying the onion soup everywhere I go  and this place definetely is one of the good ones :) Not the best or favourite, but it's up there. 

I had the arctic char which had an extremely unpleasant fishy taste to it. I've eaten fish my whole life...all sorts of fish.. because in my household we have fish nearly on the nightly basis. But I've never had fish that was so spoiled smelling. The waiter said that it was suppose to smell like this so I just had him give us a lot of extra sauce to douse it with. The rest of the plate was delicious, so I'm going to go ahead and just say, don't order the fish.

My boyfriend had the steak which came out wonderfully. I love the fries that they serve here. :) They're the thin ones that aren't completely oily or mushy. Perfect frites to go with your steak

The waiter did his best to accommodate as I didn't really enjoy the fish at all. He kept checking on me to see if it was any better and what options I might have. I would hope that a restaurant your size and reputation can just substitute the dish for me, but I didn't want to put him in a tough spot. It was a fairly busy night. I do appreciate that he tried!

I would say come in and give it a try. People seem to absolutely love it here and aside from the fish, I really did too!"}
{"text":"Best chicken wings I've had in Toronto. I also really recommend the smoked salmon... mouth is watering thinking about it now. Lovely place to sit and drink too."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night with my bf.  We ordered the nachos to share for a starter.  They were super tasty with lots of cheese.  It also had a corn salsa which you don't see often yet very yummy.  It came with a side of sour cream, home made salsa (not usually a salsa fan, but this was really good), and guacamole (again, not usually a guac fan, but this one was really good).  We got an extra side of sour cream  which costs us 75 cents - wish I was told that ahead of time because we didn't really need it.  

I had the pan-seared halibut with risotto for my main.  It was ridiculously good.  The risotto was perfect, and the halibut just flaked off.  The sauce that accompanied it was really good too.  I had to force myself to get the rest packed up before my stomach burst from being too full.  

The portions were good, and the prices were reasonable.  There were SO many things on the menu that I wanted to try.  I opted for one of the specials though.  I was impressed with all of the daily specials they had.  I liked almost all of them.  Browsing around at other people's plates, it was hard to decide what to eat.  

Just a couple of minor complaints that knock it down to a 4 star:  It took a long time for anyone to acknowledge us to be seated.  Staff walked by us (and the line of people behind us) and I would have thought that they'd alert the host/hostess, but did not.  Further, it took a long time for the nachos to come out.  It was busy, so I figured it would take awhile, however, when they came out the cheese had started to harden, so it was clear that they had been sitting there for awhile.  Despite these minor things, I would absolutely be going back to this place again.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Good gastro pub food and atmosphere. The food is a cut above standard pub fare and about the same price. The salad, the steak, the burger are all excellent. The beer and wine selection is okay and they mix up the drought selection for variety. The service is generally good, particularly considering how busy it gets. 

It does what it says well - comfort food, comfortable surrounds and solid service."}
{"text":"Really good food! They have a patio upstairs where you can hang out. Beware of wasps though!"}
{"text":"A rare gem right in the heart of Cabbagetown, this place is the place to go for great food, service and food. Yep that's right, I said food TWICE, it's that good!

The House on Parliament used to be located downstairs about a block south of where it is now. I don't know if the lease ran out or if they wanted to be on higher ground, but they closed down for renovations and moved to their new location and let me tell you, it was a good move. I liked the cozy atmosphere in the old pub, but this is way nicer. It offers one of if not the most unique pub settings in Toronto. It's clean, classic, wood accents everywhere and a beautiful bar that greets you as you walk in the front door. Staff are pleasant and efficient. There are TV's, but not in the over-saturated way that they're typically arranged in most other bars. Sufficient but not overwhelming.

Now, the food.

Try the fish and chips. Shoestring homemade fries double fried in aioli oil (I think??) with a side of garnish on them are worth a mention in their own. Beyond generous helping. Fish is battered perfectly and delicious. I think it's $14 now, which is still reasonable considering the quality and the fact that with the new location and all the renovations the overhead inevitably must have gone up. Used to be $11 which I thought was too low to make a profit on. Awesome choice. 

Second, the Bangers and Mash. The gravy is like you died and went to to gravy heaven. It's some serious stuff.

Third, the specials. Not available all the time (they change), but are all good I'm sure. I had the Kobe burger which was topped with beer battered onion rings, BBQ sauce, special cheese, regular bacon and pea meal back bacon. Served with fries and salad. All for $17. Are you kidding me?? That burger should have been $30 it was so good!

Nice selection of draft beer and bar rail. Drinks are quick and arrive cold.

Try everything. Everything is GOOD! This place rules the 416!!

GO!!"}
{"text":"Service is usually great here. Food is ALWAYS spectacular, with specials that change every day. Love the casual yet upscale atmosphere, no pretensions whatsoever.  

My suggestions: For brunch, the Eggs Parliament. Dinner: pretty much anything with red meat - they know how to cook it right! Also discovered this weekend a new favourite: the veggie-brie panini, great for brunch, lunch, or dinner!"}
{"text":"Love the staff & the people here! Neighbourhoods need to support each other...yay! Cabbagetown!"}
{"text":"Had their brunch, really tasty and be there early to avoid long line up. The dishes are creative comparing to traditional brunch, new and unique, but very tasty"}
{"text":"Great food, super accommodating of large groups (we were 15+).  They have beautiful patio upstairs that must be checked out in the summer.  Portions are plentiful, and the food always hits the spot."}
{"text":"This review is a high 3 stars, really.  
House on Parliament is one of those nice local pubs, thankfully not part of a chain, serving honest food at fairly good prices.  

I'm going to start in a strange place for this review...
The SERVICE:  I have an issue with the host.  We arrived on a Sunday for their prime rib dinner.  Note they don't take reservations...they were full, but we were the only ones waiting.  The host proceeded to seat the following 4 parties ahead of us.  Meanwhile, he kept walking by and promising to get to us soon.  Every time he walked by, he felt the need to TOUCH ME.  This continued through dinner.  I'm sorry, but I don't like being touched repeatedly by strangers...it's only cute and friendly once.

Service once seated is pretty erratic.  Depending on your server, it can be pretty good and attentive, or you can feel like you're lost at sea trying to wave wildly at a passing ship in the distance.  

The FOOD: Average to good.  It's pub fare, but not terribly refined...occasionally with execution errors.  They do a $25 prime rib dinner on Sunday, which is good value, although I left a good chunk of the prime rib uneaten, as it wasn't terribly high quality.

The DRINK:  Decent beers on tap, not usually as good as the Stout next door.  Some of the Canadian macro-micro's (think Mill Street), some of the basic foreigns (think Guinness and Stella).  I can usually find at least one beer that catches my fancy on the list...thankfully they often have something from Great Lakes.  

The AMBIANCE: I like the looks of this place.  It has a cozy pub feel.  It gets super-duper loud though, so bring your \"shoutin' voice\".

OVERALL, I guess I'm a slight naysayer here compared to the regulars that love the place.    It's good, but not great.  When I'm in this area, I usually choose the Stout over HOP."}
{"text":"This place has solid patio and classic english pub food. The beers on tap are decent and the renovations look great! The service can be hit or miss. The whole \"Im a grumpy restaurant owner\" is so played. Cheer up man, we're all here to have a good time! Overall, it's a great place to grab a patio pint or some classic pub grub."}
{"text":"This is pub food at its best! I've been going for over twenty years and this place still manages to feed a full house of hungry and thirsty diners. There is usually a line at peak dinner hours, but it's totally worth the wait. Order a drink and catch up with a friend before you gorge yourself on some fine fare. The staff is great, the prices are superb and the food will have you coming back for more! There's no other place like it, trust me!!!"}
{"text":"This institution has been on my radar for a while, being the go-to place for my friend whenever she's in TO. Whenever I mention it, her eyes glazes over and she begins to drool. So naturally, I jumped at the chance to check it out this past weekend. Even though it was Victoria Day, there was plenty of space both inside in the cozy pub and outside on the patio. If they happen to be full, there is a patio space on the second floor and another indoor space upstairs. The environment can be described as cozy, comfortable and chill. The kinda space that makes you feel at home even though it's your first time there. Friendly staff and great service. 

My friend recommended the pies and mashed potatoes, so we got the tourtiere and the steak & wild mushroom pie. Both came with mashed baby red skin potatoes, some beans and a roasted yellow pepper. The steak & wild mushroom pie was the winner of the pie battle. The flavors are hearty, strong and the chunks of beef are fork tender. The pie crust is crisp and gives a good counterbalance to the plentiful stuffing. The tourtiere is lighter (in comparison), and the thoughtful addition of the tomato jalapeno chutney further cuts through the heaviness.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Moved into the area recently and this is one of my favourite places to go now. Great beer on tap, never had a bad meal and I've tried many options on the menu. The rooftop patio is also awesome on a nice summer evening."}
{"text":"I ordered the bangers and mash, the steak pie, and a Caesar salad (to be eaten over the course of several days, obviously, delivered through Hurrier), and all of them were solid choices. The bangers and mash were the real standout - juicy sausages (don't laugh) and perfectly creamy mashed potatoes. The steak pie was also good, although the crust was a bit burned, and the Caesar salad was fresh and crunchy and yummy! I would definitely return for some good British pub food."}
{"text":"House? Check. On Parliament? Check. Also a nice cozy restaurant... suitable for work lunch affairs and romantic dates - the first of which I have done more than once; the latter, haven't had the chance. 

Interiors: Cozy, homely, vintage

Ambience: Romantic, in the poetic sense

Crowd: I've only ever been for lunch... so mostly young office going batch. The restaurant's got a nice laid-back semi-casual business vibe during lunch (that I enjoy very much)

Grub? I've only ever had the Calamari and it's great. But but but... the sauce is a tad too spicy. 

Verdict? My favorite spot for talking business with the colleagues. I keep coming back."}
{"text":"A great, eclectic menu, fun atmosphere, friendly staff. We had a good time here. Try the eggrolls and Beau's beer, you can't go wrong there. Other diners in our party enjoyed the nachos, chicken wings, and veggie panini with brie. Apparently the fish and chips were just okay, but everything else was yummo. Cheers!"}
{"text":"went back for Brunch, really enjoyed it.

The back patio is the best! Hopmosa special during brunch was a nice plus too :)"}
{"text":"So this is kind of a good news/bad news situation. Let's start with the good news, which is the food.

We arrived just before noon on a Saturday and were pleasantly surprised to note that the restaurant was already pretty full. (Had we arrived just 20 minutes later we would've been forced to wait for a table.)

Scotch eggs are a childhood favorite, so of course I had to order the Scotch Breakfast (which is advertised as \"Wild boar, pheasant & cognac scotch egg, hollandaise, baby greens or homefries\"). A while later, the food arrived and the presentation was top-notch. I took a bite out of one of the homefries and was immediately impressed with how hot and crispy they were. They're essentially homefry perfection.

The bad news was the Scotch Eggs. Oh, they were delicious. The sausage was really tasty and the outside was appealingly fried. No, the problem was that the eggs weren't hot in the slightest. It's clear they were sitting there for a while waiting for the potatoes. The kitchen staff clearly needs to work on improving their timing.

The other issue here was the service. Our order was taken fairly quickly, but then we literally didn't see our waiter again. (A different person brought our food and yet another person brought our bill.) I finished my cocktail pretty quickly and I might've ordered another had anyone bothered to ask. I didn't even have a water to sip from!

I rarely give less than 20% as a tip but I really felt like I had no choice in this case. I would certainly return to the restaurant but I wouldn't be in any hurry."}
{"text":"I am utterly biased when it comes to the HOP.  I've lived in Cabbagtown for 6 years and it is a staple for me.  

The best time to go in IMO is on a Friday night when Dale and Luke are working.  
Favourite dishes include the Pulled Pork Sandwich with the side spinach salad but the roast veg and brie panini with sweet potato fries is up there too.  The Sunday roast dinner is a sure fire hit and they always have amazing specials.  I've wanted to order the Kobe beef burger, but every time I go in it's sold out... my white whale... you will be mine!

It's also a great place to grab a drink with friends... I often go in solo and make new ones.  Everyone is so friendly and it is probably the closest thing Toronto has to an honest to goodness public house in the style of Mother England."}
{"text":"Such a place for locals, it is a hidden gem.
A must go every time I go to Toronto."}
{"text":"There are pubs, and then there is the House on Parliament. The best pubs are also restaurants that serve food to match their great selection. HOP is exactly that - a Cabbagetown staple with a great beer list and amazing pub fare. Ever since it moved next door and above ground, it's always packed on any night of the day and every brunch. 

A friend and I dropped in the other night as we were hankering for something hearty. We had the pan-seared milk fed veal liver with garlic mash potatoes, a few strips of delicious bacon and seasoned vegetables, and the reuben with so much sauerkraut it almost qualified as healthy. For liver lovers, the liver dish is pretty much the best liver I've had in the city - plump, creamy, tender and fulfilling. Even my friend, who isn't much of a liver fan, was converted. The reuben was served with heaping fries and standard mayo. For dessert we shared the apple cinnamon and raisin bread pudding which was delectable as always. 

The beer list has always hovered around 15. The Innis & Gunn pour is one of the best in the city. I usually get Fuller's ESB, but the other night we tried the Red Leaf Lager from Great Lakes, which proved itself to be delicious.

I highly recommend HOP for a good night with friends, no pretension, just solid fare done with elegance."}
{"text":"This is hands-down my favourite pub in Toronto. I love it just for the ambience -- trendy yet relaxing -- and the service is great! The food and drink does not disappoint. Loved the house caesar. The fried cheese curds appeared and were scarfed down in minutes by our group. The wagyu burger is massive and cumbersome to deal with, but it is delicious enough to make up for it. And those fries that come along with it are incredibly addictive; it's a good thing they are plentiful. The House also has a lovely little patio out front that I look forward to trying on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Read in Now magazine that the House on Parliament has the best pub food in the city so had to go. Very nice warm, not dingy, clean pub. Service is perhaps curt but professional and got the job done - they were also very busy.  I had the samosas which were more of an entrée than appetizer thinking that $10 would get you three small bites but in fact it was really quite a big dish. The pastry to filling ratio was a bit off with a little bit too much over cooked pastry but still tasty. Had the Sunday roast. Yorkshire pudding was excellent, great mashed potatos , perfectly el dente Green beans. The prime rib was fine. I would definitely return and was happy to hear that the kitchen is open until 1 AM daily ."}
{"text":"Pros:  I had the duck confit ravioli; it was most excellent.  My husband had the steak sandwich and inhaled it.  

Cons:  My son had the chicken fingers and fries and pouted the whole time.  My wine was served in a rocks glass.  The fries are served with a teensey-weensey serving of garlic aioli."}
{"text":"Visited again and sat in the upstairs. What a great little patio. Loved it. We had the scotch eggs for an appetizer. The waitress warned us that they're a little slow to come out but it would be worth the wait. She was right .. took awhile to come out  but so worth it. There was two eggs cut in two and served with Branston pickle and a grainy honey mustard. Wow! The mustard was the best I've ever had. For entree I had one of the specials which was fish with risotto and asparagus. My boyfriend had the lamb curry special which I tried. Both were fantastic. Huge portion. Great place, will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I went to the HOP for lunch on April 15th because it is so close to work and the fries are known to be out of this world. I ordered the Clubhouse sandwich and when it arrived it was gorgeous to look at. A beautifully fresh ciabatta bun, garlic aioli and fresh grilled chicken. I was so pleased when it arrived. After eating the first half of the sandwich I reached for the second and found a hair on my plate. I quietly told the waiter who was very apologetic and gave me a free replacement on the house. I thought \"this is great customer service!\" 

When I took the second clubhouse home to have for supper and started eating I reached to take some fries and there was another curly black hair hiding in there. GROSS. 

I get it.. sometimes no matter how clean you are a hair will fall or sneak it's way in and they handled the first time great. BUT A SECOND TIME! in the same day! gross. Needless to say I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"I love HOP! It has been our local go to spot for dinner for the last 4 years and we have never been disappointed! Here's why I love it:

1. Decor - quaint, cozy and not fluffy - just a good local family cozy pub feel.
2. The service - always awesome, and the same people have been working there for years...says a lot about a business! 
3. They always remember us and welcome us back.
4.Brunch - awesome breakfast burger and and the british breakfast is amazing!
5. Sunday dinner - Prime Rib is super good and the rib..THE RIBS..go early they sell out and if you're lucky to get them you will message to thank me :)
6. Great beer selection and tasty Caesars !
7. We have taken sooo many out of town guests..from the rednecks to the snobby city foodies and everyone has enjoyed it!

We are moving out of the neighbourhood and I will still trek across the city to eat here!!

LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great staff and great food. Definitely coming back here and trying their menu out. The cocktails and whiskey section looked great too."}
{"text":"I will always like the original one better than this one ..but it is a great Toronto staple and neighborhood spot.    Food is consistent. Excellent portions and delicious."}
{"text":"Came here this afternoon for their Sunday brunch menu with a friend. (On Sunday's, they open at 11 AM so don't come before or else you'll find yourself waiting outside in the cold... snow in April...ugh) 

The area that House on Parliament is situated is quite sketchy imho. You won't find me roaming these streets at night, but it's gentrifying. In the next decade, this area will be happening. Anyway, this has nothing to do with the resto itself so moving on .... 

The decor of this place is really nice. We sat by the window and it was nice to people watch, while enjoying conversation. 

There is a weekend brunch menu, but items from the regular menu can be ordered too. The Dining Companion ordered Egg Hollaindaise. Not too big and not too small, it looked delicious. She said that she quite enjoyed it so I'll take it that most people will enjoy eating it. I ordered the Spinach Salad and it was super yummy! Goat cheese, pears, walnuts, cranberry sauce, and grilled chicken over spinach. I would definitely recommend it as it was so filling and delicious. 

I found the service to be good. The staff were friendly. 

I might just have to come back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"It's in my neighbourhood so i'm somewhat a regular - food is consistent and i've never had to return anything - great fish n chips, the salads are amazing - this is a very busy pub , the seating is very close to each other, and sometimes it's so busy the service slows, SO, you need to be prepared for that"}
{"text":"After the Doors Open Toronto, I was really hungry after all the wandering and checking out Toronto's historical buildings. Found this gem through Yelp, we had this gorgeous server with the piercing on the arm - each time you came to our table, it came with a smile and made us feel welcomed, thanks. We came early before the rush and ordered the steak and wild mushroom pie, chipotle and bourbon beef rib (from the specials section) and sticky toffee pudding.
Overall, reasonably priced and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place. 

The food is consistently excellent and hearty, comforting and filling (huge portions for great prices), no matter what I've ordered over the years. I've had maybe one server experience that wasn't that great, which pales in comparison to all the wonderful, attentive staff I've encountered. The ambience here is really cozy and cute, with the only drawbacks being occasional long waits bc of the size of the place/number of diners and being seated next to really loud parties, which has happened from time to time. 

I'm not a fan of loud, crowded places, but somehow House manages to turn packed into homey and fun. Feels like you're a part of something. I so much appreciate that the food is fine dining level w the relaxed atmosphere of a local pub. I never feel out of place here, and that's saying something!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to The House on Parliament on a sunny Monday evening. The front and upstairs patio (which looks like a lovely oasis from the noise of Parliament Street) were both fairly full, but there was plenty of room inside. Immediately the service was fantastic. The server acting as the host was patient with our indecision on where to sit and very friendly. The atmosphere was lively and welcoming. 

My co-diner ordered a beer from the fairly large list and I ordered a glass of red wine; we were both pleased. And the food! I had the steak feature--a baseball sirloin with truffle butter and red wine jus accompanied by asparagus and frites. My steak was cooked perfectly (emphasis!) which isn't always the easiest with that cut and melted in my mouth. Both the asparagus and frites were solid too. It was a steal at $21. Co-diner ordered the burger feature and was also really impressed and enjoyed the house tomato-jalapeno jam. 

The excellent service and positive atmosphere lasted throughout the meal. The staff seem to really enjoy working there and ensuring patrons have a good experience. With drinks (2 each), mains, tax and tip the bill squeaked through at under $90. I was very impressed and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When I go to restaurants, I try to order different things each time so that I get to taste everything they may offer. Although here, I keep ordering the same meat pie over and over again cuz it is too delicious! 

My husband ordered the house burger and I tried some of his; it was tasty although the meat was a bit dry. 

The cocktails are pretty descent. I love the relaxed yet happening atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and you don't have to get dressed fancy in order to have a good night."}
{"text":"Taken here by my cousin for an Easter Sunday roast. This is possible the highlight of my trip to Canada. Delicious rib of beef, Yorkshire pudding, carrots and asparagus. I don't get having mash when roast potatoes are so much tastier, but it didn't detract from the great food and cider.
Host was great fun too."}
{"text":"Great food at a good price, when it arrives.  The servers can be so involved chatting with their friends that you sit for ages before even getting a menu.  A few years ago, they changed the menu and turned what had been a remarkable liver dish, done the old fashioned way, into \"liver diabolo\".  The once subtle, tender liver had suddenly become overpowered by a too-spicy tomato sauce.  I complained, asking why they'd ruin what had been a really great liver entree.  I had been a patron for some years.  The owner told me \"the food is fine, you're just hard to please\".  I couldn't bring myself to go back for 4 years.  I returned a few weeks ago, and noticed...they'd put the old liver dish back on the menu.

But ever since being told I was hard to please, I find it difficult to return.  I doubt I'll be back again for a very long while."}
{"text":"Everything I want in a chill out spot to have dinner and drinks with friends - intimate, warm atmosphere, friendly staff who spend the time to chat with and get to know you, and the fact that every dish screams \"this was made just for you, with love\". Amazing comfort food - the kind you keep eating way past the point of being full because each bite is that good. 

I love how if you want to split an appetizer, they break it down so each person pays equal amounts on their own bill. Little attention to detail and taking the time like that makes me a fan :) Will be back, again and again."}
{"text":"I seem to have more cons to say about this place than pros, but despite everything I'm still giving it four stars because it's the food that counts...

Came here with my coworkers after work for dinner and drinks. 6pm on a weekday and it was pretty sparsely filled. The service wasn't the best, but we caught a glimpse of our server once every 10 minutes or so, so it's not like he completely disappeared. The drink prices here are outrageous. My coworker who had two drinks with her meal had a bill of $96 (???) - probably because their cocktails are averaging $15 each.

The food is pricier than most places in the area (ranging $16-$30), but I think it's well worth it. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and it is a very generous portion and very tasty. The bun got soggy by the time it reached me so unfortunately I had to eat it with a knife and fork but delicious nonetheless. The meal that really got me was the lobster and shrimp roll, which my friend ordered. It was absolutely delicious, and I regret not ordering it myself. Their menus rotate very often, so I'm not sure when the roll will be back on the menu but I really am sad that it's not on their fixed menu (that the chicken sandwich is on). For the sides, they'll offer you a choice of fries, salad, or half and half - be careful if you choose the third option because they will charge you an additional $2.50 without telling you.

I should mention at this point that our server had gone MIA for about 45 minutes now. After the food came out, the last member of our party joined us, as she was running late. Unfortunately she did not get to eat because our server never came back to check on us, so he never got to see the addition to our table, which resulted in her not getting to order anything. We flagged down other servers who walked by, but no one took our order and our original server was not sent back to us. Fast forward an hour later, we were itching to leave but didn't know where the bills were. After talking to the HOSTESS, our server magically appeared at our table with the bills. Like previously mentioned, the bills were pretty hefty, and on top of that they added an 18% gratuity to our party of 5 (which normally never happens), and since one person didn't even get a chance to order water, we really were a served party of 4.

Overall, it wasn't the best experience. However I will reiterate once more how great the lobster and shrimp roll was, and I really hope they will bring it back permanently so that I can revisit."}
{"text":"The service here is spectacular.  The drinks and food are above, well above par at a price that won't rape your chequings account.  Absolutely have loved every experience being here, kudos to a well managed front of house team and high five to the kitchen staff for keeping a high standard of quality and speed.

One of the best places to dine in Toronto

@myblocktyler"}
{"text":"We've come here many times and usually order something off their daily specials. The food has always been tasty and satisfying. One time we got grilled lamb chops and they were thick juicy chops perfectly done. 
Great atmosphere and friendly service. I've often asked for substitutes and they always accommodated."}
{"text":"Lovely quaint bar on the east side. Solid pub fare. Lots of beer on tap. Very lively place. What's not to like. I hear they do a good brunch. Will try it out soon."}
{"text":"This place had been recommended to us by many folks and now I know why. Casual atmosphere, excellent service and excellent food. We had Tourtiere and the pastry was flaky and delicious. The fish and chips were also perfectly cooked and yummy. Then we both had dessert. Over the top and fabulous! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles and making our way through the Toronto food scene, we came across this amazing place!!!  We are total foodies and a bit snobby about our food.  Perfect in every way- lively bar and a much sought after restaurant because the food is that good!  We had the cassoulet and the steak special (can recall the name)- every bite perfect a carefully crafted.  The place was packed, clearly a locals hangout.  Upscale food, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a great find! The people who ran the Bed and Breakfast nearby told us that this would be one of our best bets for dinner in Cabbagetown. What an excellent pub-style restaurant!  I had a fantastic steak. My wife had a Yorkshire pudding. My 19 year old daughter had the fish and chips. All of our dishes were so good we were jealous of each other and satisfied at the same time!  And the bill of the 3 of us, including wine was less than $100.  And we were stuffed and tipsy by the end of the night!"}
{"text":"I've visited 3 times. Good food and drinks, but uneven service. Several times we were sat next to unreasonably noisy parties, and staff did nothing to intervene.

On my last visit, we were told there was a seat on the patio that we were free to sit at. About 5 minutes later, a server came around and asked if we had been sat. We were confused by the question, so she asked if we were told it was okay to sit there. Why yes, we were.

For the sake of brevity, the server's attitude and attentiveness were completely lacking throughout the service. We waited more than 30 minutes after finishing our meal before asking for the bill. About 10 minutes later, we had it. Not acceptable."}
{"text":"Went in Mother's Day and they gave her a nice plant as a gesture of thanks :)   So needless to say service is amazing.

I order the hummus and a club. Both were tasty, and the portions were generous.

Comfortable feel inside. Well taken care of. I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"The beer was cold and the atmosphere is cozy-cool. No time to try the food this time around but the menu did look inviting"}
{"text":"Super nice staff who kid around a good bit. The atmosphere was cozy and much nicer than pictures online look. A bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening with a friend, it was quite busy with a small waiting list, but we got lucky to be seated in the patio for 2 because everyone one the waiting list was waiting for indoor seats.

The service was a bit slow but it's understandable since it was on a weekend and place was packed. My friend ordered a couple pints of beer and their house burger, and I got their smoked duck breast salad.

It was my first time having smoked duck breast although I've had roasted/BBQ ducks many times before. The taste of the duck was decent, but a little bit too salty. The toasted crostini that came with the salad was disappointing because it tasted really dry inside and out, and I was hoping for a crispy on the outside, soft on the inside texture. My friend who had the house burger wasn't so impressed with his food and said it was not that great, and he's someone who LOVES burgers and eat it almost every few days from many of his favourite burger places.

Overall, the food here isn't the best, or we just didn't choose the best food? But it's still a good spot around the neighbourhood to chill and have a few drinks!"}
{"text":"While there was a wee bit of a wait, it was totally worth it. The portions were generous and the quality was excellent. They has an excellent range of beers and the atmosphere was enough to warm the heart of any British ex-pat."}
{"text":"Amazing fish and chips!! Coslaw is fantastic!! Fish very well done and fries were great! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE HOP.

Personal memories here:
- Very VERY drunk guy joining us at last call and the bartender keeping an eye out for trouble brewing.
- Always ordering 2 Red Leafs and always getting the very last one from the keg and sipping an Orange Peel in dismay
- Scotty introducing me to the entire restaurant as \"This is Sarah and she doesn't like cheese\"

The Good:
- Everything here is good
- The food is GREAT - I've had two brunches, a stellar pulled pork sandwich and witnessed a club or two be devoured in my presence
- They have Great Lakes Breweries beers on tap
- I love the other patrons - I have talked to a number of random strangers there
- The staff seem to recognize and love me & Laura M

The bad:
- the restrooms are small and not maintained through the night

The weird-and-amazing:
There is a sign in the restroom that says 'Check your dress before you leave' ....or something. :)

Would I return here?
You know... sometimes when I am out in this neighbourhood, we walk past other places and say 'do you want to try here?' ...and we always just keep walking to HOP.  We have a LIST of 'Plan B' places JUST IN CASE... but I will always spend my drinking dollars at HOP."}
{"text":"This is our go-to brunch spot! The eggs benedict are delicious! Everything is actually really good. Also, they are SUPER good with kids, which is great because we have a 2 year old."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed my most favourite restaurant in the world! 

This place is warm and cozy in every way. I almost don't want people knowing about this local favourite because it's such a gem and you'd be hard-pressed not to see lengthy line-ups at peak meal hours. 

The food is some of the most special pub food you'll ever experience. Homemade excellence in every bite. I've tried a number of dishes and I've never been disappointed. Their loving attention to detail really shines in their food. Something as simple as their spinach salad is luxuriously elevated with the addition of candied walnuts, a poached pear, a fried nugget of goat cheese and an onion compote. 

A couple of my favourite dishes are the aforementioned spinach salad, tourtière, bangers and mash and the ploughman platter. I would confidently suggest that every item on their small menu is prepared with their loyal fans in mind. I've also tried a number of their specials which, as the name would suggest, are truly special. 

They have a beautiful list of beers and wine and rotating selections as well. 

The restaurant itself is a cozy two-level house in the heart of cabbagetown. It can get loud but the atmosphere is conducive to anything from an intimate date to a family gathering. The service is always down to earth and welcoming. You'll likely even have the owner come by to introduce himself, unless he already knows you by name, which isn't unusual. The prices are extremely reasonable for food you'd otherwise find at a fine dining establishment.  

Don't expect fast food, there's love sprinkled on every dish and trust me, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times it was a wonderful dining experience.  Great beer selection, and the servers are very accommodating when it comes to selecting a drink or food.  The food is out of this world, beautifully prepared with top notch ingredients.  I was extremely fortunate to be able to sit on the patio both times I dined here, and what great ambiance."}
{"text":"I love the look and feel of the House on Parliament. I've spent many a too-warm summer evening out on the long, skinny patio enjoying beers and chatting the night away with friends. 

Come the chillier weather, both the low ceilinged bar lined with regulars at the front and the dimly lit dining room to the side are both cozy choices for gathering in. 

The weekend-only brunch menu features a colourful number of variations of eggs Benedicts. The eggs florentine ($9), although a little too vinegary still from the poaching, were pleasantly topped with not only the standard spinach, but also grilled mushrooms and tomatoes as well. The salad that was offered as a substitute for homefries was delicious as well. Sprinkled with raw pepitas, dressed in a tantalizingly fruity dressing, and plated with fresh fruit, it really lightened what could otherwise have been a food-coma inducing meal. 

The regular menu of traditional pub fare and beyond is playfully divided into \"cutlery optional\", \"forks and spoons\", \"silverware required\", and \"hands on\". You don't have to bring your own cutlery, but you might want to roll up your sleeves in preparation for what promises to be a laid back, hearty, good time!"}
{"text":"I could easily talk about the amazing food, the great bartenders and wine/beer options but for once I'm not going to. No, this is a review of something else... purely the atmosphere. Rest assured, the fore-mentioned food and drink are superb but that is actually not why I frequent the HOP. 

I go here for the people, for the staff and for the overall atmosphere. Even on a Sunday night of a long-weekend with events running rampant all over the city, I made sure that I made it to the HOP on my first night in Toronto. It is one of those rare places that collect such a quirky array of people, that it is sometimes close to too much to take in. But the key: IT NEVER IS! There is always a professor, a philosopher, a retired soldier, an ex-pat or four, an ex-staff member... I could go on and on. They are just as welcoming for new patrons as they are for the old, and meet everyone with the same sarcastic sense of humour. I have yet to check out the rooftop patio, but that is on my list before I depart from Toronto. If it is anything like the rest of this beautiful place, I know I will be in love with it."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend who was shocked that I had not been considering I live so close.

So we went for brunch, and it was delish!

Hubby had the steak and eggs - his only complaint was the home fries were just deep fried potato chunks, he likes the kind with \"stuff in it\".  

I had the French toast with Bacon and Sausage... all just perfection.

Waitress was super friendly and the seating comfortable.  Love the cushions on the bench seats!

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"House on Parliament has to be one of my fave spots in the city. I have been multiple times with different company; from family and parents to dates, siblings, friends, to coworkers! It is amazing no matter the size of your party. The atmosphere is so cozy, from the chairs to the lighting, to the table settings, you get excited to be there.
The service and staff are wonderful, they've always served and greeted us in a fun manner. 
But the food. Oh my god. The daily specials are the real treat. I've had the prime rib in Sunday's (!!!!), the steak frites with chimchurri sauce, bangers and mash, burgers, etc. 
The food has never been anything but wonderful, and at such a great price. Their deserts are pretty splendid too! Crime brule and sticky toffee pudding in sweet mason jars? Yes please.
I will forever come back here and tell everyone I know to support this wonderful place."}
{"text":"When I first moved into the neighbourhood, the House was suggested to me as THE place for excellent pub food and drinks after work. I have been consistently impressed with the food offered here, which is steps above your typical pub food. The specials of the day are always worth checking out, but one of my favourite is the bangers and mash, with the sausage constantly changing to feature unique meats. I think one time they offered kangaroo sausage for the dish (I was not brave enough to try). The fish and chips are always quite good as well, never too greasy and the chips are just the right amount of crispy but firm. The butternut squash risotto is one of the best risottos I've ever tasted. Fish specials are always cooked to perfection, and the salads are tasty and the portions are very fair for their prices.

The pulled pork I would not suggest, however, as it is quite sweet and not a fun meal to eat on a date. You are most likely going to be wearing the overly sweet barbeque sauce home on your shirt - not attractive. The mushroom and steak pie is also not up my alley. The gravy is quite salty and it takes too many beers to wash it down. I have not yet tried every dish on the menu, but I've ate my way through more than 60% of the menu and other than those two tiny bleeps, everything else has been really tasty.

The drink menu is quite extensive, and they do have reasonably priced scotches and wines. I am a huge fan of their Waupoos cider on tap. So crisp and tart just the way I like it! This is one of the only places where I have been able to find my favourite cider on tap, so if you're a fan of tangy and tart then you're going to love this.

I know there's been mixed reviews about the service, and maybe it's because I spend a fair chunk of my life savings here, but I've had nothing but pleasantness. Some of the staff do have a bit of a dry humour, but I find it hilarious and I'm kind of a sarcastic douchecanoe myself. I almost don't want to give this place a good review because I've had trouble getting seated my last two visits. But you take the oath of truth on Yelp, and the truth is, this place is awesome."}
{"text":"This place have really great vibes as well as delicious food ! Our plates were clean and the dessert was even amazing ! The people there were so nice and I love the environment of knowing your in a house! Cute for a causal night out or even a semi fancy night!"}
{"text":"I recently dined at the House on Parliament located at 454 Parliament St, Toronto in the heart of Cabbagetown. I consider myself a local and long-standing customer of the neighbourhood. My first apartment in Toronto was located on Ontario street and the House on Parliament was our local pub. The House on Parliament has undergone a location change and renovations in recent years, the interior design along with complementary artwork and accentuating fixtures and features bring out the rich history and heritage of the location. Over the years the staff have remained the same, their welcoming faces bring about the community like atmosphere. The menu is printed in-house daily. Each detail from bar menu to meal selection and dessert is handcrafted. My favourite dishes include the Fancy Bangers & Mash and the Parliament House Burger. The service completes an excellent experience and brings me back year after year."}
{"text":"This place was such a disappointment. I knew I should have left before I sat down. 

The chicken pate was delicious but the service was terrible. We had a server who  refused to use words to interact with her customers and probably, does not have any customer service experience in her life.

For example, I ordered the Posh Ploughman and the server failed to inform us that they ran out of pickled eggs unless you addressed it with them. In my opinion, you should inform your customers about missing items in their food especially when its specifically stated in the menu. 

C'mon HoP, you can do better with your wait staff. I'm sure your Yelp Reviews have told you so and its too bad you're not doing anything about it."}
{"text":"Great food at an amazing price and a good amount of food. 
We had the lamb lollipops, beef tenderloin, tourtière and pulled pork. 5 orders 5 very happy people. The food here is so good we are planning my next outing here and I still have not ordered desert. I cannot recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place for their food and selection of beers. Omg their food is amazing!! I almost couldn't remember the last time I  had such delicious food. 

Despite the wait (it was a wednesday and we waited for half an hour to be seated...) and a piece of hair in my wagyu burger (gross.. but the server immediately apologized and made me a new one)... my fiancé and I loved this place! 

Great selection of beers and the cocktail I had was pretty good.

Will definitely come back to try every single dish on their menu!!

Ambiance: 4/5 loud and busy
Food:5/5
Service:4/5
Drinks: 4/5"}
{"text":"Wow, I wanted to love this place. It's cozy, the food is good, the beer selections are decent BUT the service is so freakin' atrocious. I'm pretty sure Miguel C. and I had the same waitress - she's SO, VERY rude. 

We walked in and stood at the doorway for a little while, nobody seated us so we seated ourselves. Apparently 3/3 of the servers working stared at us, but since they're not in any uniform they looked like the patrons and we didn't notice. A server (male) came by and DROPPED the menus on the table and walked away without a word. I saw the female server walk away from other patrons as they were ordering, simply because the first of the two indicated she didn't want anything. Meanwhile, what I assume are \"regulars\" got seated and treated like you expect at any restaurant.

After we ordered service was okay from the two male servers. The food was actually quite good but took a little longer than expected to come to our table. I had the Steak and Mushroom Pie which was pretty good but lacked some flavour (perhaps a smidge of rosemary would do the trick). My partner had the Fish and Chips and said it was alright. Noticed some raisins in the coleslaw and ranch on the plate, that's a little different.

I'd never come back here again. I don't enjoy paying for the privilege to be ignored and treated like trash."}
{"text":"Very trendy pub in the area, with lots of locals. Pretty warm and cozy as well, and a good selection of food (some quite original and unique to the place -- and good!) and drinks. Portions are good, service is good and nice.

Will likely return one day."}
{"text":"So disappointed not to have eaten here, as our hosts highly recommended it.
 We waited for about 15 minutes to be sat last night. The manager buzzed by us nearly a dozen times. Would have loved a polite and courteous \"I'll be right with you, it will be about XX minutes\" or any of the other standard s, but after a 7 hour drive we weren't really in the mood for being ignored."}
{"text":"The HOP is always going to be a favourite of mine. Food is great, service is great, ambiance is great. Everything is just great. Prices aren't cheap, but I would still call them reasonable.

A beautiful space with a gorgeous patio outside. the inside is dimly lit, but that just adds to the cozy, comfortable vibe this place has going on. Classic table seating; tables meeting walls have cushioned seating, sometimes with pillows. They also have a designated seating space upstairs since its expansion, much the same. 

I usually stick with the club or the steak and mushroom pie. Both are incredible, and the portion sizes are definitely worth it. The wings and fries are super yummy. The desserts never disappoint. I love the chocolate cake and the chocolate peanut butter pie. 

My only problem would be that everyone wants to eat here, which means half the time, you could be waiting 15-20 minutes for a table during dinner hours. Trust me, the food is worth it."}
{"text":"One of the best spots visited in the Toronto area!  

We ran across this place on sheer accident.  I wanted a really good burger.  After yelping around from the hotel, came across Gourmet Burger.  Sounded good, and sort of out of the downtown Toronto area (wanted to venture out of that radius for a bit).  It's about a 20 minute bus ride from downtown Toronto area, and the path does begin to get a little sketchy looking as you approach the destination stop.  

The maps told us that it'd be a five minute walk from the bus stop.  It was more like 20 minutes.  That's fine by us.  We love to walk.  But late at night, in a semi-sketchy looking area, and a complete lack of people or cars around...   we kept ourselves positive by laughing.  And looking behind us every 3.5 seconds.  Anyway!  We get there and they're closed!  WHAT?!  Now what?!  I can't look anything up on my phone because we'd be roaming, so we started walking back down to the bus stop, trying to come up with what to do and where to eat.  

\"Hey...  didn't we pass some place on the walk here that looked like it could be a bar?\"  My cousin: \"No.\"  Me: I could've sworn we did...  and it had a name that didn't sound like a bar.  My cousin: *rolling her eyes at me with a smile*

Well, there it was!  House on Parliament.  On a sparse street, this place looked hopping.  And once we went inside, it actually was very busy!  This is when we knew we'd found a gem.  

We were seated right away even though it was pretty packed.  Ordered a Steam Whistle beer (very, very good), and my cousin ordered an Irish Whiskey - which ended up being the best she's ever had.  And she is extremely picky.  The whipped cream was freshly whipped cream!  Not canned or from a tub!  

I ordered a burger, and although it was giant and it was very good, it wasn't the best I've had.  In Canada, I've noticed they don't ask how you want your burger.  They just bring it out well-done.  I'm a medium rare girl, so I think if this burger had been done that way, it would've been better.  Regardless, there wasn't much left on my plate at the end.  

The service is what truly won me over.  Our waitress was so sweet and so helpful!  She was so friendly, and took her time with everything, and so it wasn't the fake type you get here in the LA area where they're looking for a tip.  Afterward, when we asked her where the nearest bus stop was, she explained it so well... and THEN, when she left, she came back with her iPad!  Set to google maps!  My friends don't even do that for me.  

The ambiance of this place is also great!  It's sorta New Yorky, with the long corridor stretching far back.  Starts off with the bar in the front, and then it goes back with seated tables.  Lots of wood.  Not too dark.  Not too loud, but loud enough to be fun.  

If I lived in Toronto, I'd be here often."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! Love the antique artwork and vibe of this place. Not too loud to have a conversation with someone. Drinks and food good! Great place to grab a drink with someone."}
{"text":"This place is literally a \"House\" on Parliament (Street) and it literally knocked my socks off. Don't go here thinking you'll be visiting one of the Houses of Parliament -- those are actually in Ottawa which is about a five hour drive away. Easy mistake to make (I made it). I was looking to get my t-shirt signed from the Trudeau (because, let's be honest here, he's well on his way to becoming Canada's top fashion model --no offense Monika Schnarre) but the staff here said \"No, we serve food here.\" Fine. I'm not sure if they were being typically Canadian (read: passive aggressive) so I took the seat they offered and ordered a lamb shank and a burger. Both were quite delicious and quite reasonably priced for the high quality you get. I was literally stuffed to the gills at this accurately (albeit a little confusingly) named restaurant. I would recommend this place to anyone except for someone looking to visit the Houses of Parliament (which are in Ottawa). I wrote that already, but wanted to make sure it was clear so I wrote it twice."}
{"text":"While it doesn't advertise itself as one, to me House On Parliament is the closest thing to a gastropub in Toronto.

Unlike others that actually advertise themselves as such, they don't try to create fancy menus and compete with the latest fusion restaurant. It's just a nice little pub, cozy on the inside, a comfortable outside, with a menu of simple, standard pub food (see steaks, burgers, curry, pork chops etc.) prepared extremely well. 

I always go for one of the daily specials and have never been let down."}
{"text":"Arrived approx. 15 minutes past noon and it was moderately busy. Was seated relatively quickly and ordered the scotch eggs, schnitzel, and currywurst. Out of the three, would only order the scotch eggs again. For someone who does not like pickles, avoid the potato salad on the side of the schnitzel. Expected more of a curry flavour to the sauces for the sausages for the Currywurst, but that wasn't the case. In addition, if you have an extremely low heat (/spice) tolerance, you may find that the sauce is hot. Good, but average and wouldn't order either again. Quite disappointed by the service as no one came by once to offer a refill of water in the entire duration of the meal. Wouldn't have been bothered by this if it was very busy, but business was a slower by the latter half of the meal. Otherwise, interior is nice."}
{"text":"Fuck my life..... I have found the meaning of life in this magical world called the \"house on Parliament\".
 blessed these chefs with the hands of god, 
food is a language only a few can understand and will ever be able to speak.
 but I have found the language from the heart, that sends you to a magic place that only fairy tales speak off that only the pure of heart can see........ and I have seen the light. 

Its like when I was 13 and started watching Baywatch, my first time watching Pamela Anderson running in her red bikini....in slow mo with theme music playing in the back ground.... my life is complete."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and it's for a reason. While it's busy, you can usually get a table right away or within 15 minutes.

The food isn't the best in the city, but it's good and it's always good and plentiful. I usually get the scotch eggs, but everything I've gotten has been a win.

While their menu doesn't specifically cater to vegans or people with food allergies, I've been to this place tons of times because they're so good with adjusting things as necessary and it's my GF friend's favorite spot.

When it's warm enough, I'm a big fan of the upstairs patio."}
{"text":"Rude and not very knowledgable staff. Waited an eternity (45 minutes) for my salad. Lame. I decided to give it another try for brunch. Same service but with the added bonus of my eggs served cold. I really don't understand the hype.

I'm giving it two stars because the salad was pretty good. But maybe it's just because I would have eaten the table and liked it by that point."}
{"text":"This place was on my radar for quite some time and it definitely didn't disappoint. I went with the a group of four and we were seated fairly quickly. We sat upstairs; in a beautiful loft-style dining room. It was classy and cozy. My partner and I got steak frites and a side order of sweet potato fries. Our friends got a salad and the bangers and mash.  Large portions and excellent quality food. The service was A+. They were well dressed, friendly and very attentive, without being intrusive. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals and vowed to return in the near future."}
{"text":"Food is always good there. I have been here frequently. A fall back place for me per say. Service is friendly and efficient. Solid place to hang out and to have a bite. It is a general review and will come back for specific comments."}
{"text":"The House on Parliament has four things that keep me coming back time and time again

1. Their steak frites is one of the best in the city.

2. Their pulled pork sandwich, featuring half a caramelized onion, with fries is my favourite.

3. Their beer - cold and in a glass - frankly you don't need much more than that. They've got a good selection of light, red and darker ales. I love the Red Leaf. 

4. Their staff - I feel like I'm drinking with friends every time I go in there. Go often enough and they are quick to remember your name, your order and your peccadilloes (like my not wanting butter on my pulled pork sandwich - it's a small detail to remember but makes me loved)

OK maybe a bonus fifth factor - I love hanging out at the HOP because everyone there lives in the neighbourhood and has that kind of camaraderie where you can strike up a conversation with anyone and be best friends in 5 minutes that, when you find it, you realise how great life  and people can be. That sense of community is a bit like a post-war England vibe, which would match the decor."}
{"text":"I give the 4 star rating for the spinach salad alone.   Oddly, I love spinach salads and this is without question the best I have ever eaten.  

Overall I really like the atmosphere.  There is a relaxed laid back cadence to the place  that makes you want to stay. It was exceptionally busy but the noise never competed with conversation.  The service could have been more attentive, we had to remind our server several times about drink orders already made but I liked the experience too much to be particularly bothered by this. 

It is an intimate, inviting place for a beer and, surprisingly, also quite good for food."}
{"text":"-
This place has excellent food, drinks, and ambience.  Cabbagetown is a great place to go out for a night.  The House of Parliament's patio in summer is awesome - esp at night.  I had a burger which was great, but the salad & dressing that came with it, had in it fruits and nuts and tasted amazing.  This place is highly recommended.
-"}
{"text":"I do agree with a lot of the reviews here.
I used to frequent this place when I lived in Cabbagetown. We'd be there least every monday for half-priced wings. I also used to go here for lunch and a pint on the patio when I had split shifts at the Beer Store up the street.
I go there less now, since I've moved away, but have discovered the breakfast. Overall, the kitchen is the best I've seen in a pub. Their standard menu has some fantastic food. The club is the best I've had. The burger is great. The wings are delicious. The fries are fantastic and come with garlic mayo - yum! For brunch, the Eggs Parliament and all the other bennies are your best bets.
Their special menu is something to marvel at. There are the different burgers (kobe, lamb, bison), there are the supremes, there is the steak, and others I've yet to try.
The only meal I didn't thoroughly enjoy there was a breaded pork special. Other than that, I've never been disappointed with my food. I should mention that the steak and stilton sandwich and the pulled pork as a bit too rich for my taste, but I know people who love them. I even have a vegetarian friend who used to repeatedly join us on wing nights and get the veggie burger, which he insisted was delicious.
The old location was fantastic, if a little cramped. The reason they moved is to accommodate more people. They also bought the property for their current location whereas they were renting the old place and had a landlord to deal with.
The staff is friendly and prompt. I may be biased because I am in good with them, but I see how they treat everyone and it's nothing but friendly. Everybody seems to get along great with the staff.
A great place to eat, drink and hang out. \"Going to the HOP\" is something I don't do often enough."}
{"text":"The place is nice and the waitress was friendly. Their viggie burger wasn't the best though and we had to wait long for a table."}
{"text":"You should try their steak and pie! It is so gooood! It's the first time That my friends and I are here! We love this place! It had lined up but totally worth waiting for it!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this awesome pub on St Patrick's Day.  We knew it was the right place to be when we saw the wee little Irish dancers running in.  We were welcomed warmly and seated immediately.  The pub was worn, dark, cozy, and absolutely perfect.  I felt as if I was having dinner in someone's home.  I enjoyed an amazing lamb pie with smashed tatos.  It was rich and hearty with an amazing depth of flavor.   The gravy was perfectly done.  The hubs enjoyed a plate of bangers and mash that he said was really good and surprisingly spicy.  The kid enjoyed fish and chips which was generous in size, light and crispy.   I wish we lived here so that I could make this a weekly staple.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Now that I've gotten over the HOP's move, I feel I should revisit my previous review. 

It really is one of the best pub's in town. Neck and neck with The Queen and Beaver for delicious pub fare in my opinion. I think I *slightly* prefer the HOP because it's cheaper... and who doesn't love extra beer money?

I was there last week and I had the tortiere for the first time. Great ordering, if I may toot my own horn... it was huge and the potatoes and veg were buttery and perfect. Also, very reasonably priced. Only $13 at dinner!

Great local beer list, and I've never gone wrong ordering one of the chef's daily specials. 

Hop on over to the HOP, pals."}
{"text":"New location - same great food. It's charming in a newer sort of way. The service hasn't changed,  just way more seating!"}
{"text":"Love this place for brunch and dinner. Always busy but never have to wait long if there is a lineup. Haven't had a bad meal there yet and I have eaten there at least once a week for the past 2 years. If they have curry on the specials, order it.  Steak and Mushroom pie is my other go to."}
{"text":"The food here is simply delicious.  We order the calamari (yum), the duck salad and the steak sandwich. 
Each meal is actually a big portion so don't over order. Best to skip the appetizer as you won't be able to finish your meal. 
Instead go for their desserts! The last dessert item on the menu (can't remember now what it was called) was the best!"}
