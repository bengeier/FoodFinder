{"text":"Banh mi sandwiches here are delicious and very authentic. We had the lemongrass chicken and grilled marinated pork...both were packed with meat and pickled veggies. We also tried the mango bubble green tea, which tasted more green tea than mango, but was still refreshing and hit the spot on a hot day."}
{"text":"Ineffable is now my go-to morning place. I am very particular about my espresso and I it's excellent here. The head barista, Ben, knows his stuff and has trained the other baristas. I've had my machiato made by three different people and they've been consistent and terrific.  We are vegans so we order the avocado toast which we like. It is also very consistent and delicious. The owner, Phat, is vietnamese-american and the menu reflects that, including vietnamese coffee.   This place has been open only a few weeks so I wouldn't stay away because of any negative reviews. Phat is serious about taking care of any problems and takes the reviews to heart. Given that Ineffable is only a few weeks young it is fast developing a customer base."}
{"text":"So glad we visited this cozy chic gem today! The banh mi thit kho (braised pork belly) was pure melt-in-your-mouth gloriousness. I was craving my mom's thi kho--a vietnamese must-have comfort food--and the banh mi hit the spot.    The comfy study booths were great for settling down with a snack while working. So much detail and thought went into the decor and set-up of the shop including convenient power outlets and dimmable lighting. There were also really nice touches like sewing table repurposing and rustic wood-paneled walls.   I got a chance to chat with the owner of the place and he was super friendly and passionate about honing his craft. We'll definitely be back here and highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Awesome.  The baristas know what they are doing.  Excellent espresso.  Staying in Lawrenceville for four days.  We went to Ineffable 3 days in a row for morning coffee and over the top toast with avocado. Extremely friendly owner and staff."}
{"text":"This place just opened up the street from my house and I am OVER THE MOON excited. I grew up eating bahn mi and this is the first really authentic one I've had since moving to the Burgh. The owner, Phat, is super sweet and attentive. He did an amazing job with the space, and you can tell it was a labor of love for him.  Coffee is great... I mean all the coffee. Sua da, iced, what have you. I just had my first Thai iced tea here which is right on par with everything else I've had. They have a really good morning glory muffin. I LOVE morning glory muffins. Like, really love them. To me, they are the superior muffin. If muffins had a kingdom, they would be king. I am ecstatic whenever they are available to me. The barista gave us a complimentary slice of cream cheese banana bread, which was super moist and also very good.  Love that they're growing produce on the premises, that there are lounge areas, including an outdoor space with heating elements for the cool months ahead. Everything is super well thought out. Can't say enough good about this place. Don't hesitate, GO!!"}
{"text":"This trendy-cafe is the perfect spot for a quick bite or a pleasant workspace. The tofu bahn mi is excellent, and the bowl version is good, but I highly recommend the bahn mi over the bowls.  Additionally, their Vietnamese iced coffee is always perfectly rich and creamy; again, I highly recommend! And, finally, their bubble tea is one of the best in Pittsburgh so far, much better than the watery/overly-sweet tea that places like Fuku serve.  All-in-all Ineffable is a great stop to make, especially if you want a quick lunch or a great atmosphere to work or study in!"}
{"text":"Maybe just a rough start.  First, I'll say the good.  The space is very well renovated and huge, and it is definitely a place I would normally go to read, work, etc., while sipping on some coffee. Beware of reviews that only focus on the aesthetics.  I don't go to restaurants or cafes because they are \"Insta-worthy\".  Now to the bad.  The warm bahn mi with butter and sugar was problematic.  First, the bread wasn't fully cooked, it seemed like the french bread you buy par-cooked from the frozen section of the grocery store.  Not sure if it was, but that was the look.  Completely white/pale, doughy, etc.  Not close to bahn mi.   Even past the shitty bread, the butter/sugar was not good.  It tasted like garlic.  Oh yeah, and it took 10-15 minutes to get this from the kitchen while the whole place was empty.  I also ordered a cold brew coffee.  It was incredibly bitter.  I've never added sugar to cold brew and I had to here.    A bubble tea was also ordered, but the boba was not fresh.  that should be a warning to someone ordering it -- \"hey, our boba is a little old, do you still want it?\"  People may find the space convenient to study and hangout, but it won't be because what they're selling."}
{"text":"Very good banh mi sandwiches and very friendly counter clerks. Lots of varied options for seating. I'm not sure what's up with that 6 inch tall coffee table near the couches though."}
{"text":"They have a small breakfast menu, but the main attraction is obviously the banh mi sandwich, of which their menu features 4 kinds: pork belly, marinated pork, fried tofu, & lemongrass chicken. I had the marinated pork and the fried tofu. I couldn't really taste the difference between the two, so I suppose that's a good thing.    The baguette was crispy and fresh as were the toppings (cilantro, jalape√±o, carrot, etc).   They have a selection of bubble/milk teas that is pretty impressive, as well as a full espresso bar. I ordered a latte and a thai tea with boba which were more-or-less your standard fare: nothing special, but still good.   The staff was friendly and helpful. They were happy to answer my questions about the menu. The place is clean and spacious with ample seating. There were a lot of college-aged folks there working on laptops and socializing etc.   I'm giving 4-stars not because there are (edit) *no red flags or complaints; there is just no real 'wow' factor. You won't be blown away, but you'll be satisfied.   This is an overall good dining experience. If you're thinking of stopping by, it is indeed worth a trip."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have found this place when I was staying nearby. The interior is hip and inviting. Their Vietnamese? drip coffee was perfect. It's never pre-made, only made to order. The breakfast sandwiches? are filling and freshly made to go with the best bread, it's all about the bread! I'll definitely be returning here if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"My friend took me here so that we could study together, and I'm honestly so confident that this place...once the school year picks up...business will be booming!  The interior design is not only beautiful but so efficient too! Somehow a garage became an INSTA-WORTHY environment. The light fixtures and simplistic design  ultimately create the perfect spot for studying, catching up with an old friend, or relaxing on your own.  Unlike most cafes, this place has PLENTY of seating! Not only that, but there are booths in which you can adjust the lighting and have your own personal outlets!  Another bonus? FREE WI-FI! The password is posted where the trash cans, napkins, sugar and cream are.  How is the food? The menu is perfect! Not too overwhelming nor is it limiting. The Banh Mi sandwiches are made with care and taste super fresh! You can choose among 4 types!  And the drinks? Honestly the coffee is so good! It definitely tastes fresh and authentic, which means a lot coming from me because I'm super picky with my coffee! I got the Iced Vanilla Latte (as I was craving something sweet). You can ask for skim or whole milk. They even sell Vietnamese Drip Coffee! And they grind their beans to order! I have yet to try the bubble tea, but I have no doubt that it will be of quality as I've seen so many customers order the green tea!  The bathrooms are clean and the service is so friendly! The guy who owns the place so evidently cares for the customers and puts his heart into his work! He talks to customers to see how he can improve the experience for everyone.  I'm MOST DEFINITELY coming back! I low-key (selfishly) want to keep this place to myself, but I already know that I can't stop the buzz! And I wish the workers and the owner the best, though I'm confident they don't need luck with the overall quality of this business.  UPDATE: They now have chicken pho on the menu! Have yet to try it myself but it sounds promising.  The manager Ben is super super cool! The service here is exceptionally patient, helpful and personable. Can't say that about most places.  I tried the bubble tea (Raspberry Green Tea with \"1\" sweetness and Pomegranate Popping Boba) and it was perfectly refreshing and fruity for a sunny day. Would get again! Excited to try other flavors and toppings. They offer non-dairy milk options (soy and almond milks), which is amazing. The raspberry flavor is sooo good especially because it's made with fresh juice (real bits of raspberry inside).  Will definitely come again for a longer stay! (They have coffee, bubble tea and food!)"}
{"text":"What a bright and airy space to hang out and grab a bite! As other reviewers have mentioned, the bahn mi is great here and I think the pork belly is the star of the menu. They also serve authentic Vietnamese style coffee here -- the kind that brews in your cup, complete with condensed milk at the bottom that you mix up yourself."}
{"text":"We tried this place while we were in Pittsburgh dropping our daughter off at Pitt. Really liked the coffees and staff was friendly. Cool venue too. On the downside we missed breakfast by a few minutes and the lunch choices were limited to 6 items. Somehow our ticket didn't make it to the kitchen so we waited 45 minutes for the food. The manager apologized and gave us a complimentary cake. When the food came out it was ok. The bread was fresh, like a big baguette. Lots of bread with a little bit of filling of chicken and veggies. I think the lace has a lot of potential, but I wouldn't recommend the lunch food."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh coffee shops, take notice of Ineffable Ca Phe. Chic interior across multiple, varied sitting areas with customizable lighting and seating make you want to just stay and buy more coffee, teas, and delicious food. Excellent adaptive reuse of a building that does not look like it would be a coffee shop but it's a perfect fit. The Vietnamese drip coffee is excellent. The process takes about 5-10 mins. I haven't tried the bahn mi yet but tried the great tasting breakfast sandwich which is composed of eggs, crispy bacon, and melted cheese on a lightly toasted bun. Note that breakfast is served 7-10am and lunch is served after 11am so be aware that there is an hour where no hot food is available, only baked goods. Overall a great new addition to the coffee/food scene in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The best part about this place is the atmosphere! The decor reminds me of the lovely cafes in San Francisco. There are comfortable booth seats, wifi, couches, and succulents! It's a great place to go for a casual date or a catch up over coffee. It's a little loud (at least over the weekend) for someone to study I think, though I did see people do that at some booths.  I love banh mi but compared to Banh Mi and Ti (which is another very cute Vietnamese sandwich/Boba cafe in Pittsburgh), the sandwiches weren't as good.   Even though Banh Mi and Ti has better sandwiches, I prefer Ineffable Ca Phe because there's some parking right in front of the cafe and a much larger space to sit and eat!"}
{"text":"Super cute place! It's quite spacious with an open feel so doesn't feel like some crammed coffee shops.  The chicken sandwich was really tasty! The bubble tea I got was not my favorite, but not bad either. Will definitely go there again in the future."}
{"text":"Woah hello. Tasty banh mi spot and SUPER spacious for those who like to study in coffee shops.  LEMONGRASS CHICKEN BANH MI ($8): Good sized banh mi with well seasoned chicken. They have the essential crunchy pickled carrot/daikon and cucumber, cilantro, jalapeno, etc. What I do wonder is what the recipe is of spread they put on it.. it was delish! VIETNAMESE COFFEE/ CA PHE SUA ($4?): Classic Viet iced coffee, strong hit of caffeine from the dark roast complimented by the sweet and creamy condensed milk. You even get the traditional Phin coffee filter on top of a glass to drip over the condensed milk.  Tip: Ask for a glass of ice on the side, wait for all of the coffee to drip, mix, and pour over ice so that you can enjoy it as an iced coffee :).  STUDYING/WORKING POTENTIAL: There is so much space here to study, pick a table or the couches or their shaded tables outside. I saw a decent amount of outlets too! There isn't a great deal of \"noise\" here, so it's not loud and bustling if that's the vibe you like to work in.  Atmosphere here is pretty trendy and I'll be sure to make another trip here."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were really good, and the tea was also fine. It took a while to be able to give our order, though, and the cappuccino was undrinkable. The building itself and the decor are really cool."}
{"text":"Fantastic little neighborhood gem!! Well thought out space that is inviting and chill. Food I tried (pork belly) was fantastic! Excellent coffee as well."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to the Pittsburgh coffee shop scene.  They have done a nice job with the renovation, there is no pressure to drink your coffee and get out and the sandwiches are good.  The addition of a salty lemonade while it is still hot out would be awesome!"}
{"text":"First, the space is fantastic. There is plenty of room to park yourself for an hour or two and do some work or enjoy a good book. The natural lighting is magnificent and the decor is very pleasing.  I popped in around 11am hoping to grab some breakfast but they had stopped serving the breakfast menu and only offered lunch, which is limited to all things bahn mi. I enjoy a good bahn mi but I have to be in the mood so I was a little disappointed with the lack of options. Luckily, they serve baked goods all day so I settled on a cappuccino that was good and a slice of banana bread that was scrumptious.  My husband got a bubble tea (yum) and a bahn mi bowl, which he thought was tasty.   Overall, I think this is a great addition. I will definitely be back but next time I will come early enough to get a proper breakfast or with an appetite for bahn mi."}
{"text":"The five stars are for the space alone (though the coffee and food isn't anything to sneeze at, which we'll get back to). Ineffable Ca Phe is the work/study/catch-up spot that I didn't know Penn Ave. needed. The atmosphere is immediately welcoming, with plenty of tables/booths large and small (another plus, lots of electrical outlets). I came in for a late lunch one day and had one of the banh mi, which came on perfectly crusty bread with fresh and crisp veggies to cut through the rich pork. I also treated myself to a Vietnamese coffee, which kept me tided over and caffeinated until I had to leave to go to work. Everyone working who I met that day was so friendly and obviously excited about the opening. Such a lovely addition to the neighborhood, and one I hope to enjoy for a long time."}
{"text":"This place has a really unique, calm, vibe to it. Great place to study or do work but also super cute place for an afternoon date. Full coffee bar, some breakfast items/pastries, and banh mi. The banh mi was great! I've only had banh mi twice in my life (the other at another Lawrenceville establishment) and I felt this was better of the two. Really fresh ingredients! I love my cilantro lol. And beware the jalape√±os are hot as heck!! Of course I have to comment on the outdoor seating---it's lovely! String lights hang from above and there's a little garden that runs the length of the area that's growing heirloom tomatoes and Brussels sprouts (out of what I noticed). Will be back to try the Vietnamese coffee!"}
{"text":"I think the best part about the Ineffable Ca Phe is the Banh Mi sandwiches, but that is not saying a whole lot.  The sandwiches are just sort of simple, straight forward and kind of almost boring.  There is nothing wrong with them, but their isn't much to make them stand out.  If you like Banh Mi though, I guess this is the place to go.  I got a latte and I really liked it, but I did not get the Vietnamese coffee.  The other thing is Banh Mi's don't really seem to go well with coffee.  I never liked bubble tea because of the condensed milk, so I steered clear of those.  Everyone in the place besides us was a student on their labtop writing papers for their deadline.  I have to say I like the way the place is set up.  It is very welcoming.  It makes for a nice place to go for some coffee, so I may be back at some point.  I am not really jumping out of my pants to get there again, but it is alright."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of ineffable ca phe and I tend to stick to the same order because I am ADDICTED to their tofu Bahn mi. The seasoning of the tofu is just right and it isn't that over bearing fried taste. Comes with the tastiest radish and carrot slaw, cucumbers, Thai style mayo, cilantro, and jalape√±os if you desire. I always opt for extra slaw/cucumbers and add the jalape√±os. The inside of the restaurant is great for studying with ample plugs. Plus, if you feel that study fatigue kicking in- the Vietnamese coffee is to die for. Also, if you sign up your credit card for their rewards program, the points rack up pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"This place was once a motorcycle garage and now it's a coffee joint. They reused the old floors and made it Art Deco. Also they have bubble Teas and a restaurant too.  Bring everyone you know to this local coffee shop and you will be happy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes in Pittsburgh. I've visited a few times, and I can usually get some space to sit down and get some work done while feeling very comfortable.  I usually get a banh mi and a chai latte, both which I can recommend. For the banh mi, I prefer the pork belly one but one of my friends swears by the marinated pork. Although I might like the sandwiches at Banh Mi and Ti a teensy bit more in terms of taste, combined with the drinks and the space at Ineffable, I think it just depends on the situation which I would go for.  In terms of other offerings, the vietnamese drip coffee is great for the experience, but I think for the price point I'm satisfied now that I've gotten it once. Their pho is alright, but I wouldn't pick it over the banh mi. This might also be because they just have chicken pho right now, and I prefer beef for pho."}
{"text":"Amazing spot. Good sandwiches, bubble tea, pho, and rice bowls. The space is comfy and welcoming. Spent many days working here since it opened. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not possessing any semblance of a sense of direction, it took me a few minutes of pacing Penn and checking Google Maps to find this place, but I shouldn't've worried; this is easily spotted between 40th and 39th Streets on Penn.   The outdoor section, along with a prodigious gravel lot with cars and bicycles, contained only a few people, including one couple chatting with the owner, who, like the rest of the staff, I would later come to find knowledgeable and friendly.  Behind an impressive coffee bar with high-quality grinders and espresso machine, the menu seems to me to naturally fall into three main categories: third wave coffee, bubble tea, and food offerings.  The coffee menu was a traditional espresso caf√© list of offerings, with prices on the cheaper side of coffee shops in Pittsburgh; my cortado was only $2.50. Large bags of Commonplace beans adorn the walls in groups of three or four, and the bean quality and skill of the barista was clearly apparent.  Being peckish as well as in need of a wake-up, I ordered a marinated pork b√°hn mi sandwich. It was absolutely fabulous: filling, tremendously tasty, spicy, and fresh. I added a little sriracha for an extra wave of spicy-food-endorphins, but I really didn't need any flavor enhancement: the pork was juicy and tender, the vegetables and herbs were fresh, and the bread (from local bakery BreadWorks) was light and crusty. I've had b√°hn mi at quite a few places in Pittsburgh (from the new Bahn Mi and Ti to the quirky Lili Caf√© in Polish Hill), and I'd rank this very very high on the list.  After polishing off my sandwich and espresso, I poured myself a palate-cleansing glass of water and ordered the one item on the coffee menu that I've never seen before in Pittsburgh: Vietnamese iced coffee, or c√† ph√™ sa ?√° (literally, iced milk coffee). Redhawk Coffee in Oakland serves \"Vietnamese cold brew\", sweetened with condensed milk, but the barista helpfully explained to me that this is actually brewed right in front of you in a special contraption not unlike a Frankenstein-like combination of an Aeropress and a pourover.   Hot water drips over compressed coffee grounds into a cortado-glass-like vessel with a small amount of sweetened condensed milk. This process that takes ten or so minutes, making this the perfect drink to enjoy while you're hanging out or spending a few hours working.   The coffee is amazing; just the right amount of sweetness (I'm not really a sugary-drinks person) to complement but not overpower the coffee, which was a little fruity but not acidic at all. A little bit of a process to go through just for iced coffee, but the quality is worth the time it takes; it's not just fancy presentation for no reward.  I spent the next hour or so hanging out in the space; the shop was built from an old motorcycle garage, and they kept the original floors. This place benefits from a level of space customization most coffee shops couldn't dream of: booths have custom dimmers for each overhead light, making it the perfect place to snag for a long-term work session. There's plenty of couch space, too, for curling up with a book or cuddling votre petit(e) ami(e).   It's not as cozy as other coffee shops I frequent, so getting into the productive flow that other places inspire in me took a little while, but visceral reactions to the feel of a place are so individual that I'm not really qualified to review that aspect of the place.  Really, you should come check it out yourself: even if it doesn't become one of your camp-out-and-write-your-screenplay places, it's more than worth an hour of your time to sip some c√† ph√™ and chow down on some pork belly.   Really the one thing I didn't try was the bubble tea, but there are so many amazing bubble tea places in Pittsburgh, I'm sure the rest of the offerings here would offset even objectionably bad bubble tea. I've heard good things from other customers (several of whom ordered the green bubble tea before I placed my order, and were very willing to talk it up), so it's definitely on my to-try list.  Five stars for this place, despite only visited once; I'm convinced entirely of its quality."}
{"text":"Concur with prior reviews.   Pros -tasty bahn mi at a reasonable price, spacious and will likely return for a date with books.  I do wish they have a more extensive selection for lunch currently 4 sandwiches: 2 porks, a chicken , tofu.   They do have a great boba collection.   Will likely be back and looking forward to more offerings."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about life is when I'm not led astray and find cool places like this. It reminded me of a non-flooded, Houston, cool spot. It has a chill ambience and the openness of the front is very inviting. Pennsylvania, I appreciate the feels you give me of home."}
{"text":"Stopped by for an early dinner.  We had the Bahn Mi (pork belly) a rice bowl and a couple of Vietnamese coffees.  It was all good.  The pork belly was flavorful and moist.  The toppings and roll were fresh.   I will definitely return.  The place is large with plenty of seating.   No music so it was very quiet.  Almost like a library with everyone whispering."}
{"text":"Bahn mi is yummy a bit dry in need of more sauce. Coffee is decent. Very interesting vibe not quite sure about it yet."}
{"text":"I was driving on Penn Ave and almost stopped in my tracks when I saw this place. It caught my eye due to the fact that it's adorable & has a parking lot (a rare sight for a small business in the Lawrenceville area). The outdoor seating area was absolutely adorable, and the inside was even cuter. They had a child's nook with books & games, a cozy area with couches & books for the adults, and lots of seating- tables and booths. I have never tried Vietnamese coffee and loved reading about the process on their wall. I ordered an iced coffee and a lemongrass chicken bahn mi to go. The iced coffee needed some cream & sugar (I can't handle black coffee just yet), but it was really good! They have a rewards system, which is really cool- so I made sure to sign up! It's a really modern system, so every time I visit and use my one credit card, I will automatically receive points for my visit- no carrying around a punch card that you'll surely lose or forget. I really loved the book section with it's \"take one or leave one\" message. How awesome! I hung out for a bit, sipping my coffee and enjoying \"Where the sidewalk ends\" by Shel Silverstein. What a pleasant Friday afternoon! I didn't have the opportunity to meet the owner, however he was very present and was walking around and talking to guests while I was there. I went home and ate the bahn mi there- it was fabulous. Fresh baguette, tasty chicken, fresh veggies, spicy jalapeno and delicious cilantro. I loved it. It was only about $8 too which was really reasonable. I adore this place and can't wait to come back ASAP."}
{"text":"Awesome spot, super airy with tons of light. Great environment to do work. Tasty and cheap food.   Note: their WiFi was god awful. Hope they fix that."}
{"text":"Amazing place for some yummy Banh Mi!   First of all, if you're visiting this place for the first time and have to rely on Google map, be prepared for a little detour. For some reason Google map leads us to the back of the restaurant instead of the front... Oh well!  We visited to grab some quick lunch before Steelers kickoff game (go Steelers!) and were in a hurry. Luckily the service was super fast! Highlight of the meal was definitely the braised pork belly banh mi - so yummy! The pork was so moist and tender and perfectly seasoned; the picketed carrots were surprisingly delicious. Definitely recommend!  I wanted to get some bubble tea. After staring at the bubble tea menu for 5 minutes, I ordered green tea (thinking it's green tea milk tea...) The staff was super nice and offered a free cup of milk tea on my mistake :P I liked it, but it was a little bit too sweet for me.   Overall it was a great experience! I'd definitely come back and recommend to any friend."}
{"text":"The first time I visited this restaurant, I almost gave up finding a parking spot (and almost went home). I think I drove around the neighborhood 5-6 times. I am so glad I did not give up, because in that first week alone, I came back two more times with my husband. The owner guy was extra helpful in figuring out a way for me to take a sandwich back home for my husband (so the sandwich won't get soggy from the sauce and meat). I've tasted their pho and rice, but still think their sandwiches are better. Noodle soup can be a good addition to the sandwich, but it cannot replace it. (And I'd go to Pho Minh if I am craving good pho). And try Vietnamese coffee!"}
{"text":"This cafe has a beautiful interior with lots of work space as well as a more relaxing area with couches and board games. A great place to stop by for a quick coffee or snack or to bring a laptop/friend and stick around for a bit. I met a friend here and got a Vietnamese Coffee while she got a raspberry bubble tea. We also each got a slice of pumpkin bread to go with our drinks.   Both drinks were very tasty - the cashier was very friendly and politely double checked that I knew what to do with my coffee. It was light and sweet, and I should have gotten two! The bubble tea was nice as well - not too sweet and the bubbles were prepared well. They have quite the selection of flavors and toppings for the tea, so lots of options to suit many tastes. The bread was awesome as well :) I look forward to coming back to try a sandwich sometime!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I just ordered the wrong thing. Don't do pho, just don't. Stay with a banh mi and you should be fine. The pho was far from authentic. Where are the bean sprouts? Basil? Sigh. Worse was the chicken. Like cooked chicken breast cut into a few pieces and thrown in. Double sigh. Don't get me started on the broth....... Food 2 stars.  The tea selection was good and tasty. Can't speak for the coffee, though did seem like a popular choice. Drinks 4 stars.  We came on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed. The space we found worked to plug up for a bit, but didn't offer much space to eat and work. We quickly moved our dishes after we finished to enjoy tea while plugging away. Our spot was suboptimal by the back door. It was raining, so water made it's way in (keep your bags off the floor!). If you can find a spot elsewhere, then I'd recommend doing so. Environment 3 stars."}
{"text":"Perfect coffee shop for the Lawrenceville area. Great place to plug in, get some coffee and get stuff done."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I've never seen a hipster coffee shop serving Banh Mi's. I wasn't really sure whether this place was a coffee shop or a delightful Banh Mi kitchen, but either way -- the coffee and banh mi were both really delightful. I'd skip the Pho next time.  The Banh Mi (I think I had the pork belly) was delightfully tasty and the bread was perfectly done. The chicken pho was just okay, but the Cortado and Vietnamese coffee were both incredible!  I also loved the layout, how work-friendly this place seemed and the comfortable tables."}
{"text":"Beautiful and functional space, good food and drinks, friendly service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A new bahn mi place in town? I'm definitely trying it!! When we first arrived, I was a bit confused as I thought that there was parking inside but there isn't. There were three spots with cars that never moved so make sure to park on the street. I loved the concept and atmosphere! It's spacious and relaxing. There were a bunch of people studying. Food wise, I thought it was mediocre. The bahn mis are overpriced and I don't think it was really worth it. BEWARE, It bothered me that I had initially thought that someone was going to serve me so when I was paying, they asked me to sign my credit card and tip. After I had ordered, I realized that you have to grab the food yourself and then clean up after yourself. Why did I tip then? Would I come back? Don't think so. The only take away is that the drinks were decent though... we got a Vietnamese coffee and chai tea but like I said, this place is overpriced."}
{"text":"Solid bahn m√¨s and coffee! Big space with a dog friendly patio out front. Ideal for laptop work or group meetings since the space is so big. Has three parking spaces, but street parking on this stretch of Penn is free. The traffic light and American flag are off-putting, but they're trans-friendly."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some bubble tea that was my main reason for heading over  ugh parking was a hassles they have a lot right in front for 3 cars but a mini van decided to park its self in the middle  such a way that it was not possible to use the other two spots yeah there was some snow and ice but babe pull yourself to one side  ok I was not giving up on my bubble tea ...I parked on the street in what was not a real spot head in  the place is huge lots of nice looking spots to sit  but not for me today  they have some muffins coffees and of course bubble tea menu I see they have banh mi but not till after 11am (it was around 930am) lots of bubble tea flavors including just good ol green tea with bubbles nice friendly girl helps me  tells me the bubbles are soaked in a brown sugar mix the tea is strong the bubbles perfect squishy and I love them  I will return"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get work done on the weekends.  Street parking is easy.  The place is spacious, well lit, and not overly crowded.  They have bubble tea but I prefer their Vietnamese coffee.  Most important perk of Ineffable Ca Phe: Pretty decent food!!!  Most coffee houses serve you pastries or nothing at all.  But here, you can get banh mi (Vietnamese subs) or pho ga (chicken pho).  You can pick from sofa, to high top, to booths.  There's games if you want to play.  Food if you want to eat.  Drinks if you're thirsty.  Plenty of space for you to spread out.  All of this completed my check list...it'd be pretty hard to go back to a regular coffee house now."}
{"text":"What a creative great idea. Love this place! really great space, so well designed, and perfect as an alternative work environment. The coffee is very good, the service is very friendly, and the sandwiches are very tasty.  This place is becoming my regular office away from office now!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee shop w/ perfect atmosphere and space.  Came for the coffee and now a regular after having their banh mi.  Also breakfast sandwich is on point .  Love this place."}
{"text":"Don't go on a Sunday if you're looking for food. The entire place was filled with people on their computers and I barely found a table. Also, I got two bahn mis, one chicken and one pork (both ordered with no jalape√±os) and I think I got two of the same sandwich, one filled with jalape√±os. And neither barely had any meat in in. Not worth it at all. I would have returned them but I was so hungry I couldn't wait.   I may go back for a coffee someday, but definitely not for the food."}
{"text":"great place. the decor is very modern  i had the Banh-mi sandwich with pork bell it was great the bread was perfect the sandwich came with a cabbage type topping, carrots, cilantro, and jalape√±o"}
{"text":"Definitely the best cafe to work/study from. Coffee is phenomenal and the B√°nh M√¨ is delicious! The staff is friendly and the owner really cares about his customers and their experience. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ineffable a couple of times. I really enjoyed the atmosphere...great to spread out and work/study, plus they have couches for relaxing or if that's where you do your best work. The outside patio is a nice touch as well. The regular coffee is good as is the Vietnamese coffee, but the $4.50 is a little steep for a simple Vietnamese coffee. Same goes with the bahn mi. They were good, but on the small side and cost $8. The staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"A totally incredible Vietnamese experience that was worth multiple repeat visits. The cafe was perfectly laid out especially in the nice weather months. The bahn mi (Vietnamese hoagie) was almost overshadowed by the insane coffee. I had the fried tofu sandwich which was off the charts!!!  This place needs to be on everyone's culinary radar, especially if they are Newbies to the world of Vietnamese cuisine..."}
{"text":"No. Just...... No.......... No No No No No No No No No! Don't have anything else to say, so I'm not sure why this stupid fuckin' app is telling me it's too short. I'm done with this crappy spot and DONE With this post!"}
{"text":"** Hip atmosphere and tasty sandwiches. Decent portions and spacious.  The first thing that stood out to me about this place was its atmosphere. Being from the Bay Area, I been to my fair share of San Francisco coffee houses and restaurants, and I immediately got SF vibes walking into this place. There are board games, plenty of space to work with laptop outlets, and good lighting for having a conversation or just eating.  I got the lemongrass chicken banh mi, which I really enjoyed. Decent portion sized and definitely tasted good. They do add a few peppers in the banh mi, but I didn't think it was too bad. Although I didn't get any drinks, they have a decent size coffee and bubble tea selection.   A bit out of the way for college students to get to but I definitely would want to come back here again if I have the chance!"}
{"text":"The space is fantastic. Everyone has said it and it really is well done. They also have three off street parking spots which is SO rare in this area of the city! Greatly appreciated. I stopped in for takeout and ordered the lemongrass chicken and the grilled marinated pork, both were good but the lemongrass chicken was the real star of the show. Bread was crunchy and fantastic and chicken was loaded with flavor. I would highly recommend that one! The pork was good, but I prefer the drunken been from bahn mi and tea if I'm being 100% honest. I didn't get to try any of the teas as we were heading out but next visit I absolutely will.  Service was quick and friendly. I would absolutely return."}
{"text":"I came upon Ineffable by chance, I just happened to be taking Penn Ave down to the strip district and the stringed lights caught my eye. I took a quick glance, mentally noted the name and Yelped it. My first experience, I ordered two pork belly banh mi's and a Thai tea through the Yelp app and stopped to pick it up. I was blown away when I waked in, it's a seriously beautiful cafe! It's absolutely a hipster cafe but I love it! The details inside are amazing, there is a long table by the register that has the old Singer cast iron sewing machine legs as a base which I found clever and a beautiful way to reuse those vintage pieces. Now for the food... I wasn't overly impressed by the pork belly banh mi, I guess I wasn't prepared for all of the fat on it but I'm absolutely going to give one of their other food options a try. What stood out the most for me was the Thai tea, ITS AMAZING. I'm not joking, they have the best Thai tea you will find in Pittsburgh. I literally have to control myself or I'll gulp down a large in minutes! If you've never tried Thai tea, please go here first. This is definitely going to be a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"I went here for a bahn mi right after this place opened and it was amazing. Everything was super fresh and delicious. The bread was particularly amazing and cooked perfectly. Probably the best bahn mi I've had in Pittsburgh thus far.  I also ordered an iced coffee which was delicious and very generous on the size and price (though I think they were still getting used to things and gave me a larger size than they normally wood).  The atmosphere looks like a casual modern coffee shop and you order at the counter.  The owner came up to us as we were eating to ask what we thought and he was very friendly and clearly passionate about his work.  I look forward to going here again."}
{"text":"I love this little Vietnamese coffee shop, that also serves Banh Mi sandwiches. I personally love their bubble tea. They have a variety of flavors you can add to either a green or black tea, also you can pick your sweetness level (1, 2, 3).  I got the mango green tea with boba at a level 2 sweetness. It was delicious and refreshing on a hot spring day. I spilt the pork Bahn Mi with my boyfriend, and it was amazing! They use very fresh ingredients and the pork is super tender.   This hidden coffee shop is a gem to study at or hangout with friends. They have plenty of seating in and outside, and books and board games to play."}
{"text":"Amazing place to spend some time studying and doing productive work, drinking Boba tea and coffee. I have not tried their food yet but it smelled good. My husband tried their desserts and they were really good. We biked here from the southside and it was worth the trip. It is a very relaxing environment with an industrial  look and very helpful staff. It's a little off the  beaten path and not Very centrally located but easy to find and with good bike parking and I think car parking. It is definitely worth a try. The  Boba tea is real and is not made from powder."}
{"text":"OMG I LOVED THIS PLACE!!! As soon as I walked up to the building I could tell it was going to be cute! Once I got inside it was just so cozy and comfortable.  There were some sitting areas with couches and chairs, some bar top seating, and a bunch of large booths.  It was perfectly designed for people that want to go to a cafe and work on their computer.  At each booth there were individual light switches and multiple outlets.  There was a spot with games and lots of children's books too which was really cute!  In addition to the atmosphere, the food and drinks are delicious! My boyfriend and I ordered the pork bahn mi and chicken bahn mi and we shared a large pomegranate bubble tea! Everything was AMAZING! The bahn mi had the perfect ratio of crusty bread to delicious meat and fresh vegetables and the tea was perfectly sweet and creamy! I would totally order it all again and I want to try more! I have a feeling I will be back verrrrry soon!"}
{"text":"Went here to work this past Sunday, and my husband and I loved it! There are plenty of outlets, adjustable lighting, and good wifi. The decor with the succulents is nice, and the owner was very friendly. The food and drinks are really good as well. I had the milk tea bubble tea (it's sweeter than I usually like but I know I tend to prefer less-sweetened drinks), and we shared two banh mi sandwiches (grilled pork and pork belly). Both were really good, but I absolutely loved the pork belly one.  We will definitely be back soon. Parking was a bit of a challenge but we did find street parking."}
{"text":"Anything related to bahn mi.  I am there!  This has been on my radar fo some time and the experience did not disappoint.  It's a great spot to study, catch up on reading, or bring along your kids as there are comfy couches and games/books.  They give a lot of meat and the pickled veg is great.  I ordered a kumquat boba and it gave an interesting bitter aftertaste, but I didn't mind it.  I'd definitely come back here to get some work done with a coffee or tea.  It's welcoming and I'm sure when it gets warmer it'll be a nice spot to enjoy the sun."}
{"text":"Couldn't resist coming back to this place. My first time here blew me away: the banh mi was AMAZING, and I was not expecting the spacious and study friendly environment. I came for a second time to study on a Monday afternoon. Ordered the banh mi thit kho (pork belly) and a cup of coffee. The banh mi hit the spot (again); it's juicy and filling. They also offer a fried tofu banh mi for vegetarians! I'm trying to stay away from pastries but I'd recommend their muffin! I tried a piece and the first thing I noticed was how moist it was. So good. There are plenty of tables including counter top spaces, booth tables perfect for 3-4 people, couches and regular tables. PERFECT for studying; I was there for probably 3-4 hours. Only issue I had was connecting to the WiFi but fortunately my friend could connect me to the Xfinity WiFi. Later, the cook came around with samples of a pork chop he's trying out for a new dish (can't turn down free samples...) I'm excited for his finished product!   TLDR: I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Coffee and bubble tea review:   I've only had the Vietnamese drip coffee and bubble tea here, but I'm eager to try the banh mi!   Vietnamese coffee - delicious, really strong, so the condensed milk it comes with helps break down the boldness. I also asked for a cup of ice (thanks for the tip, Yelp!), and had my coffee iced instead of hot. It's on the steeper side in terms of $, but would recommend if you're staying in there to work/eat, since it takes time to steep.   Bubble tea - surprisingly good! I had almond milk tea with boba, which lived up to my expectations. They definitely use powder for some things, but I liked how thick and flavorful the tea was, not watered down like a lot of other places. The variety of flavors and toppings is great. I came mid-afternoon on a Sunday and they were running out of a few things, but the baristas made sure to let me know once they heard we were ordering bubble tea. Side note: their boba isn't sweet/soaked in honey, which I prefer, but still was good boba consistency!   Atmosphere - overall, great place to study/work/eat. Love the antique sewing machine tables, which were large enough for a friend and I to sit at and work. Sometimes can be crowded, but turnaround is rather quick, since some people just stay to eat."}
{"text":"We had some fantastic espresso while waiting for our chicken and pork belly bahn mi sandwiches. They were both delicious but the pork belly was particularly well done and juicy. The place is well designed and spacious, perfect for getting a coffee and staying a while to relax with a book or get some studying done. We had been hoping for a cafe just like this to open and here it is in a renovated garage! Somehow it seems very Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Like the remodel/environment.  Sat at a booth to do some work and have lunch.  There were a few others working on there computers, too.   The tables are all on very old/antique sewing machine stands. the booths seats are a little higher then a normal chair but comfy.  The table was about the height of a computer table so easy to type but I did find myself leaning forward for some reason.  Guess I like a harder backed chair to type when using my computer.   Ordered a Banh Mi that was marinated pork that was cut into small strips with fresh cilanto.  Added the sriracha to add some more taste.  On a fresh baguette.  A very good Banh Mi.  Had a Bubble tea that was good.  You can pick some flavors to add if you wish.     there was some nice softer music playing in the background."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Having wanted to come here since they opened a few months ago but never had the time nor the appetite.  Today was different.  Ordered a couple of their baguette sandwiches and sat outside on the front porch.  Never imagined that sliced carrots could be the secret ingredient to such a great combination.   The fresh crunchy feel was just right.  I just wish this food was served downtown during the weekday.  Maybe a food truck in the future plans ?"}
{"text":"Such a cute vietnamese themed coffee shop in Lawrenceville. My friends and I came here on Saturday. There are some spots outside and street parking. It is pretty spacious, so even though it was crowded we found a table. They have coffees, teas, bubble teas, and a small menu of bahn mi sandwiches. I had a thai iced tea and the grilled lemongrass chicken bahn mi. The thai iced tea was really sweet, but delicious! The bahn mi was stuffed with a crunchy slaw, veggies, jalepenos. I was worried it would be bland, but it was super flavorful and very filling. A great place to do some work and have yummy food. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The vibe here is great. I have been looking for a coffee shop that has the space to hang out and get a lot of work done. All other coffee shops in the city are so small. This is a place that I have been hunting for. I got granola and a breakfast sandwich to split with my date, and both were excellent."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, we love it so much! The owner really did the space right- a good mix of table sizes, plenty of outlets, and even a soft-seating area where you can play board games. Great patio as well. Very inviting space. The person who helped us was great and explained the Vietnamese coffee situation, which was our first time trying it and it is great! I've had the chicken banh mi and it is great as well!"}
{"text":"The bahn mi is really good here, I've had quiet a few in my lifetime and I would say this place is close to the top of my list! The only thing I did not really like about the place was that it was more of a study spot for people to chill but not the restaurant vibe that I expected. Overall, great place to study if youre in the area w some good bahns"}
{"text":"Really liked the aesthetics of this place. All the decor and lighting give this a very chill vibe. Nice place to stop by with friends for a cup of coffee or bubble tea. And if you're hungry you can eat Vietnamese food like pho or banh mi. If you follow them on social media, sometimes they have half off pho nights. I got the chicken pho and regular Vietnamese drip coffee, both were very good. The staff were so nice."}
{"text":"We've been a few times now for coffee and finally made it for dinner to try the bahn mi sandwiches. Super tasty, and very fresh with good flavors. You should also be sure to try the Vietnamese coffee which takes a few minutes for them to make and is small in size, but worth it for something just a little sweet and different from what you can get at all the other coffee shops in town. We also love the casual environment and toy corner for kids. It's a spacious place with comfortable seating and a modern decor. Love having this place in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for a couple of months now. The owner is a super nice guy, who always asks how the service is and what he could do better. The food is delicious and fresh. Coffee is always good. Space is great. And in a neighborhood with not a lot of parking, they actually have a parking lot!  Great place to hang out, great place to grab lunch, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for dinner a few nights ago and ordered a peach green bubble tea as well as the pork belly bahn mi. The pork belly was extremely tender and flavorful and there were plenty of toppings! However, I do think the bread from Bahn Mi and Ti is significantly better, and I wish there was a Viet special option here. Still a good option for a quick lunch! Their bubble tea was lacking in tea flavor in my opinion.   The ambiance is definitely what makes this place amazing and unique. It's a huge space and has tons of outlets/USB ports stationed around. There's huge booths, comfy couches, smaller individual tables, and even outdoor seating. I can definitely see myself coming here to get some work done and sip on some coffee throughout the week!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from the lady that does my nails in S&T. I've been waiting for this place to open ever since. The interior design is very cute and spacious. I went there on a Thursday night and we placed our order in advance online and everything was ready within 30 minutes. My boyfriend got the chicken banh mi, I got the marinated pork banh mi. I like mine a lot, the only suggestion I have is that they can put more meat and veggies in. Both me and my boyfriend have a lot of leftover bread. Oooh the best part about my dinner is their Nutella brownies. It is absolutely phenomenal! I didn't get a chance to ask if they make the dessert or somebody else made it. But hey they sell it and it was part of my dinner from here, so it goes to part of their rating. Nutella brownies was the best, I'm so glad I got it :)"}
{"text":"This new place on Penn is conveniently located and quite easy to find. For months we'd walk by waiting for its opening and now it's here!  I love the layout of the restaurant it's well decorated, welcoming and spacious with a comfy coffeehouse vibe throughout. It's a good vibe to have considering the amazing coffee selection on hand. There are other beverages such as Bubble Tea, hot teas and more. The owner, Phat is kind and knowledgeable and puts out simply delicious foods. Some of the best Vietnamese grub in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is smart. Smart for so many reasons. Mainly for setting up a spacious environment that's warm and inviting, but also offering a stellar menu. I'm not necessarily a fan of coffee, but I respect their traditional approach to Vietnamese coffee. The process is so cool, and they will take the time to explain it to you're interested. The good thing is they also offer tea, so I can grab a pot of oolong and chill at one of the many tables.  I love that there are individual outlets to plug into. You don't have to go crawling on the floor in search of that ONE outlet... There are many to choose from on the walls above and below. If you sit at one of the many booths you can also adjust the lighting. Who knew I needed dim lighting... But I do now!   My only complaint is that the tables, specifically the booths, are pretty low compared to the seating. So you're crouched over your laptop, which is definitely not good for your back. I'd love to see the tables elevated a tad or the seating be lower. I get that the seating probably won't be changed because it's built in. And the table base is old Singer sewing machines, which is again super cool, but not conducive to working.   Aside from that, I can definitely see myself popping in for a tea and a delicious bahn mi sandwich. The pork belly one I tried was really good. Everything is made fresh in house, so they said once they sell out for the day, that's it!"}
{"text":"Super cute and worth stopping by!  Most places in this category are so small and cramped that you barely have enough table space for a drink and a book, but this space is large, spread out, and has plenty of room for larger  groups if needed.  There are also a variety of spaces including outdoors, couches, tables, counters and booths.  Very well decorated, knowledgeable staff (they helped me make the perfect Rose bubble tea) and just has an overall good vibe.  Looking forward to trying what the kitchen offers on my next visit!"}
{"text":"A super interior space. Great coffee. Unusual food that is fun to eat. My girlfriend and I have found a new favorite work space!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch today and must have come on an off day. The person at the counter taking the order was spaced out and we had to repeat our order several times. While waiting to pick up our food, the person behind the counter forgot our coffee was to be iced and asked twice. Not that big of a deal, but we were the only ones in line.   While watching the food being made, we noticed two things: first, the shop was short on bread. One would think that a restaurant that only served bahn mis would have enough bread. Second, the meat was microwaved before being placed on the bread. Microwaved.  Finally, the sandwich. We ordered the roasted pork and roasted chicken. You could not tell the sandwiches apart. Instead of having nice slices of meat, the meat was chopped up into pieces - like match stick slices of meat. There was more bread than meat, and more pickled vegetables than meat, so that was disappointing.  Hopefully our next experience will be better, if we come again. But, for a $7 sandwich, you can get more meat at subway. We've had better bahn mis at the place in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"This is a perfect little Vietnamese coffee house. They have a good selection of coffee, tea, and other drinks including bubble tea.   We tried the Vietnamese coffee it was smooth, delicious, and a very cute traditional presentation. It has a really good kick of caffeine but was not better at all.  We also tried the bubble tea. We had the kumquat with kiwi bursting bubbles and the passion fruit with pomogranate bursting bubbles. They we're very refreshing and not too sweet.  We tried the pho ga and the grilled pork Bahn mi. The soup was very nice. The broth was very flavorful and filled with tender noodles and chicken. The Bahn mi was perfect. Crunchy bread and fresh veggies complement the delicious pork. These two are a perfect complement to each other I love to dip my sandwich into the broth.   The location is set back from the street and although today there was not outside seating there will be soon. The interior is large with plenty space. Tables, counters, and couches creat a very comfortable environment perfect for relaxing and working.  This will be a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Ineffable? No  Don't just read the reviews; read into them. These words would have been useful to me prior to entering this establishment.   Flavorless weak coffee. An over-priced bland chicken sandwich.  A packed house of young, wannabe hipsters staring at their phones and laptops.  The coffee at the Gas station one block away was much better. I know because I went straight there after leaving this one on the counter.   First, the barista assumed I would know that the coffee he put on the counter, on the other side of the machine, completely out of my sight, was for me. After 5 minutes of standing there, he condescendingly proclaimed that my coffee was over there.  The sandwich was about 3 ounces of meat and sauce on a large crisp hoagie.  I had high hopes. I almost threw it away after one bite. I stood up and thought no way.  Just take another bite.....  Nope, still no flavor except the thin sliced Jalepenos, which actually were nice, but nothing special.  This was not a horrible experience.  It just does not warrant anything more than 3 stars right now. Maybe they will improve, I hope they do. I will read the reviews and try it again if they are still open in a year or so."}
