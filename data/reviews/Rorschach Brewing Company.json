{"text":"This place actually has some great beer, BUT... they have to get their stuff together with regards to service."}
{"text":"Excellent beer and great food.  Very inviting atmosphere and friendly staff.  Great place to go and quench your thirst after a day on the beach. Can't wait for patio season."}
{"text":"2 IPA's and another PA on tap that are out of this world! I'm not a saison guy but if you are...they've got 3 of those too! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"A great spot to stop after an afternoon at The Beaches. A short distance from the beach, this brewery has lots of seating in and outside. There are many windows allowing lots of fresh air in. The service is great. Beer is refreshing and the food came reasonably quick given how busy it was. I recommend relaxing on the patio!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to stop in here since the summer after discovering this brewery at the Toronto Festival Of Beer. Finally got the chance and was quite impressed. 

They had a terrific selection of beer and had a tough time choosing my flight. Enjoyed every single one enough to take some home for the future.

There was a light snack menu that was also pretty great. Fries were perfect! 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly and found the overall experience well worth the travel to the east end.

I would recommend this place to any craft beer enthusiast and will definately return."}
{"text":"We cycled over to the east side, and after a nice visit to the Leslie Spit to enjoy the view, stroll the post-apocalyptic rubble beach and work up a thirst, we dropped into Rorschach for a beer. So we were primed for a beverage. The location and the place is impressive - a quaint hideaway with a big terrace on the second floor. 

The beer list was extensive and I would have liked to spend some more time here to explore. The beers have appropriately psychological names and I ordered a Reverse Psychology, which they were unfortunately out of. I ended up with a Truth Serum IPA. Which I really liked. Nice and hoppy-floral with that bitter undercurrent. My fellow bike gang members ordered a Curry Wurst - which I had a taste of and it was better than expected. Quite tasty actually. I was so charmed I had a second Truth serum just to make sure it was as good as I thought it was. And, yup it was. 

We will be back Rorschach to sample your other offerings."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the beaches. I've been excited to try Rorschach since they opened, and I was kinda in love with the witty psych references. But really none of that matters if the beer isn't any good. 

The beer was great, the food was delicious, and the people were really nice. The beer list is pretty self explanatory - it's all laid our, and detailed on the menu. And if you have any questions about the beers, the servers are well versed. 

The food was great! The plates are tapas style/ shareable portions. I've never been to a brewery with good food until Rorschach. 

To top it all off, I love the building! The upstairs patio is so calming and surrounded by trees. And the seating area inside is super cozy. 

Bring friends, share some plates and try a flight - I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Get insight into your friends, and your own, psyches with your beer selections. The list is long and varied, with titles like \"Truth Serum,\" \"Reverse Psychology,\" and \"Normopathy.\"

I had the Truth Serum IPA and it measured up, being among the best IPAs I've tried at craft breweries around town. Our group of 5 occupied a range of spots on the personality and emotional spectrums, so several different beers were tried. Everyone was happy with their order (which, in the inkblot biz probably means at least one of us is lying or mentally unwell). No matter, this was a great place with cheerful, efficient service and a nice outdoor seating area along one side of the building on the 2nd floor.

I kind of wish we could have sat at the picnic tables in the front of the building, which are open on 3 sides instead of 1, with a more open view of the street and the park, but it didn't look like there was any service there. There is a bar area and a dining area on the main floor inside as well, so Rorschach looks like it is a good place for groups big and small, and both casual drop-ins and organized parties.

I was stoked when I heard the place was called Rorschach. I expected the interior design to have made a bit more of the inkblot motif. Some areas felt like they weren't 100% finished, and where they were, they weren't especially unique - a touch of generic craft brewery feel - chalkboard menu, wooden bar, wooden tables on the first floor, basic outdoor patio furniture on the second... But inkblots are so watery, loose and finely captivating that it seems like a missed opportunity for wall / floor / ceiling / fabrics / carpet design, something more 1920s, something more\"psychological parlour game.\" The glasses have inkblot / Rorschach branding, and they look good.

But hey, that's just the Truth Serum talking - don't take it as a negative. The main event - the excellent beer is enough of a draw."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and the beer here is great! I consider it a hidden gem bc not many people know of it. I've tried the food, and let's just say I'll stick to the beers.

They rotate the beers on tap by season and you can buy some that are prebottled to bring home as well.

My favourite beer there is their sour beer, I think it's called hedonism or something. But it's got notes of pineapple. So good!"}
{"text":"Awesome beers, good wings and friendly staff.  Can't believe it's only been open a year, they've already got a great lineup of brews."}
{"text":"Amazing beer that is so unique. This isn't just another \"craft\" beer place that opens up and has the regular lager to serve. Every time we swing by there's a new beer to try, friendly staff to help us out, and the place is so freakin' beautiful too. The sit-down pricing is pretty reasonable. The take away is something that I can only afford as a treat (but oh do I love these treats!).
Live music - go check it out - the jazz band that we saw was beyond impressive.
Order the fries - homemade ketchup had us nearly sneaking into the kitchen to steal ;).
This place won't get old!"}
{"text":"Summer isn't the same without exploring some new craft breweries that are popping up all over this city.  The choice this time was Rorschach Brewing Company.  Does anyone else struggle with saying \"Rorschach\" because I sure do! LOL.

Anyhoo, I came here with another Yelper Elite to check out what they have to offer our tastebuds.  For a craft brewery, they have quite the expansive beer menu with a lot of their different interesting concoctions of beer.  I think they have a wide variety to satisfy a whole spectrum of tastes and with some definite palette pleasers.

We tried a whole array of their different beers over the course of the evening with multiple 4 oz tasters on the table at any given moment.  It was a really fun trying all the different flavours and I really enjoyed the nekyia (black ipa with chocolate/coffee notes) and the preconscious (saison with lots of dried apricots).

We also helped ourselves to some of their yummy items on the menu too such as the jerk pork belly skewers (yum), eggplant fries (double yum), and dressed fries.

We sat on the second floor where there is a long and narrow patio to enjoy the sweet summer breeze.  It was really nice up there and the trees provided some shade from the setting sun.

It's a chill vibe at the brewery on the weekday that we visited and it's kinda isolated from the other queen street eateries but I feel like Rorschach can offer all that you need.

I could definitely see myself going to Rorschach again to try the new beers that they creatively come up with as well as enjoying that patio atmosphere.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised when we went to their one year anniversary party. They had live music. The place looks deceptively small but it is fairly spacious. They have some really good brews, which I was surprised with. Some unique flavors and IPAs. In fact, I wanted to buy one, but they did not have that particular beer in stock. I will be returning to get some beers. Service quick. Bathrooms could be more sanitary. Parking in a Green P lot next door."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time to get an idea of what they've been brewing up!

We sat on the patio upstairs. Very nice, if a little sterile in terms of decor and ambiance. 

Our server was excellent. Very friendly, prompt and was able to answer all our questions about the various beers they were offering on tap that night. Even made his own suggestions, and was honest about his preferences. Very much appreciated. In fact, the server who greeted us when we arrived was also nice. A friendly vibe permeated throughout, that counteracted some of the iciness I've encountered at other popular west-end breweries. *cough* Bellwoods.

On to the beer...

If I recall correctly, we sampled their blueberry IPA, Pina Colada IPA, basic sour, amber saison, apricot saison, and one of the two pale ales. Would have liked to have tried their basic IPA, but they were out of stock.

Overall, the beer experience was okay. Nothing spectacular, but interesting at least. The highlight for everyone at the table was the pina colada IPA. Very nice balance of subtle pineapple and coconut flavours, with a nice mouthfeel and depth to it. Not too much carbonation and a nice creaminess, like it's namesake. The apricot saison was also very nice, capturing that apricot tartness that you don't typically find in other apricot ales on the market. The amber saison was also unique, and very drinkable.

The lowlight for me was the blueberry IPA, which was watery and devoid of hops, tasting more like a weak sour. The blueberry flavour was too subdued. I didn't taste it at all on my first sip. Their basic sour beer we tried was also too light-bodied and one-dimensional, and the pale ale had an odd muddy flavour, likely from the use of a rare type of earthy hop which I wasn't familiar with. Perhaps it just wasn't to my taste. 

The beers all have overly long, complicated names that I can't imagine is helping anyone remember them. Bottle shop prices were also pretty steep ($9 for a 500ml of the pina Colada IPA, for instance) so we skipped on that.

We stuck to a liquid diet, but the food being delivered around us smelled very tasty!

In summary, I'd be happy to return to Rorschach, though it wouldn't be my first choice. Interested to see what other fascinating beers they come up with. Hopefully bottle shop prices come down in the future, although it's unlikely given the size of the space (rent must be a lot).

Give Rorschach a shot!"}
{"text":"The building alone is a fantastic destination. The interior is fun, and their rooftop patio is rather large and quite peaceful while looking eastward over some grassy unused land. 

As for the beer, I have to say that I appreciate them having a good number of beers to try, with over 12 house made beers available upon our visit. 
They offer pints or 5oz samples, but do not offer these sample as flights like most other breweries would. This means that there is no volume discount once you get a 4th beer, and there is no holding tray so once the server has dropped them off at the table, it's on you to remember what is in each of the glasses.
As for the beer itself, I'd say was a mix of hits and misses, with a juicy Double IPA that I forget the name of being my favourite. I can appreciate that they did have a wide variety of beers and styles and some more experimental ideas, I just think they need to fine tune some of the recipes so there isn't such a mix of mediocre to great.

But that all said, the weak link here is the food. We had a bunch of different things from the wings (1 pound = 6 wings), 3 Dip Platter (2 of which didn't get eaten), and a burger and veggie burger.
I've gotten used to overpriced burgers, so I won't comment on the regular $18 burger as I'll just say it matches the 3 star review. However my girlfriend had the Lentil Veggie Burger ($16) and was wildly disappointed. From the bun actually being made of the falafel like patties (so there was no bun) and instead of coming with fries it came with a seaweed salad. To add cheese to this hilarious representation of a burger was an additional $3. So $19 for a veggie burger with no bun and seaweed as its side dish. Two people at the table ordered this veggie burger and both were unimpressed.

So to sum it up, go here! 
Enjoy the patio! 
Try some different beers! 
But I'd skip the food."}
{"text":"Great beer and excellent friendly service! I tried the \"pineapple sorbet\" beer based on a recommendation from the bartender and went with it because I wanted to try something new. The beer was fantastic! Very creative and tasty flavors."}
{"text":"I got to experience a delightful hidden treasure a Eastern Ave today .Rorschach Brewery. As you enter into the Pub, you already know, you're going to experience something a little different. Went upstairs to the patio, which over looks a park and western half of The Beach. Tasted some of the beers, \"God Spot\" ,\"Truth Serum \" and \"Polygraph \" Highly Recommended \"Truth Serum \" which is an IPA. Normally I like wheat beers more but this IPA was much better for me.
Food on the menu , was absolutely fantastic, loved The Cajun smoked wings and Jerk Pork belly skewers, just the right amount of seasoning and heat, for you to want even more.
Services was courteous, and very attentive to all of our needs. 
Can't wait till Summer hits, when I can truly enjoy this Patio. I'll be back very soon to enjoy the rest of different beers and other things on the menu. Cheers!!"}
{"text":"I came here for their Saturday - Yoga and Beer morning.  Yes you read that right.  Yoga and then beer  :)

They clear the back area of the tables and bring in a local yoga teacher for about 50 minutes of practice.  Then afterwards head to the bar for your beer.  The choices here are pretty interesting and fun.  They had a mixed berry beer which we affectionately called the beer mimosa.  Light, fruity and just perfect after working up a sweat!   the yoga/beer is $20 - seriously you can't beat that price for a fun morning (even if technically you are working out).  They also serve brunch there as well - it's not an extensive menu but it certainly hits the spot.  I had the chicken taquitos (3) and they were delicious.  

I did check out their other events - trivia night and cheese/beer pairings are some examples.  I'll definitely be back to try the cheese/beer pairing!

The parking lot is a paid lot unfortunately - sucks but it is what it is.  Carfeul when driving in- there are some barriers set up so it's a bit like an obstacle course to get to the lot."}
{"text":"Good service but I'd give there food a 3 at best. 

Had pork tacos which were very bland and chicken wings. Only received 3 chicken wings, which j thought was rather cheap for the $10. 

The wings were over seasoned and rather boring. 

The beer was good, but I wouldn't go for the food."}
{"text":"Awesome patio upstairs. Cool place. Great beer. One of the best I've been to in terms of quality. Great menu. It's all good here."}
{"text":"A fantastic beer selection - if you're going for a session with mates perfect. However, the menu could use a revamp . Perhaps they make the dishes extra spicy so you'll keep ordering more beer? The fish tacos tasted more like crusty batter n slaw (barely any fish in sight), the spring rolls didn't taste of much except heat and were served on a random bed of spring mix (floppy) . Calamari was a salt lick. I wanted the food to live up to the beer - hoping they revisit because otherwise such a fantastic place. Service was amazing."}
{"text":"We just happened to stumble upon this place and were pleased.   I love the idea of brewing the beer right there and being able to purchase bottles on your way out!  I am not a beer aficionado so I can't comment on the quality of the beer, but what we had was simply wonderful ( I went with the lightest of the beers).  Their food was really good.   The free potato skins was a nice touch!  One of the owners greeted us and asked is if we enjoyed our stay, which we did.   I will go back when the weather is warmer and sit on their patio which had a nice long bar!"}
{"text":"Amazing giant brewery with terrific owners with an excellent view of the lake and free parking. Snacks are great - currywurst was way better than Berlin. All the food smells excellent, and each beer is great. They have an identifiable style but enough variety to make me want to try new things.  Plus - eggplant fries. Patio season's gonna be great, but worth sitting inside with big open windows."}
{"text":"Yesterday I made my 1st visit to Rorschach; I was meeting 3 others there.  The Brewery is located a little off the beaten path, though not far south of Queen St.  When you enter, their bottle shop is on the right, then there's a hallway leading to their indoor seating area, then another passageway leading past their brewing facility to a stairway to the 2nd floor where their washrooms are.

When the others I was meeting started arriving, we were informed that a large group (actually a Company) had made a reservation for 50 people, so we shifted tables a couple of times to accommodate the group.  I didn't order any food so I can't comment on it except to state that 2 others in my group did order food items which looked pretty good and had nice aromas.  One other in my Group and I decided to share beers so we could experience more of them and we shared 6 of them, all of which we both found quite nice and flavourful with a wide variety of flavours and styles apparent.  Considering the very big other group was also there (they arrived gradually later on), our server still managed to check our table without too much additional delay.  People in the big group gradually left while we were still there so that helped too, and as we had to listen to some speeches by Representatives of the big group due to being seated in the same area, we were rewarded with tickets for each of us for comp. drinks.

Due to it being winter and night time, I didn't have an ample opportunity to check their patio, so I look forward to making it back when the warmer season arrives so I can check it out.  All in all I was quite impressed with the décor, service and beers I/we had which left me with a fairly memorable experience."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for this great neighbourhood brewery.  Service here is just what you want in a beer hall.  Friendly and really educated about the beers they make.  Their beer offering looks really inventive and creative... just unfortunate they sold out most we wanted.  Even though, the ones leftover didn't suit my tastebuds doesnt mean you won't fall in love with their offering.  Try their sample size and learn about the different varieties and flavours Rorschach can create.

 I honestly like Rorschach Brewing Company and would recommend any beer lover who is trying out microbreweries in Toronto to give this place a spot on your 'must visit' list.  The place is just south of one of the main roads in the Leslieville.  It's a converted house with a GREAT rooftop patio.  It has the right amount of shade and sun to keep you relaxed and happy up there.  The gentle breeze comes through and they have good classic rock playing... it's a bit retro but it can keep most people thumping on the table.  I also like Rorschach because they have a full kitchen and it's not just snacks.  

I'm new to the beer game and so my tastebuds veer towards the lighter and less bitter.  Yeah... I'm that person but to be fair, I just started to sip beers a few months ago.  I can definitely appreciate a darker beer done well... I may not be able to handle more than a few sips but one of the stouts we tried was definitely one of the better stouts I've had.  The original beer list here is huge and varied... it's at least over 5 pages worthwhile reading.  What I found on a Saturday, that I'm not the only one in Toronto that likes the lighter beers or ones with a citrus or fruit spin on it.  Most of the beers I saw online were crossed out sadly.  BUT I will say for those who love a good dark beer, there is tons for you to try.  

As I mentioned, service here is very good.  I know which beers I like and sometimes a microbrewery can go far into the deep end with their descriptions.  When you have a great encyclopedia of beers to choose from, help is really appreciated.  Our server was helpful because she guided us to the remaining beers that would be interesting to us... also offering a tiny taste to ones we were sure about before ordering a flight. Prices here are very good to try before investing in a full glass.  To me, part of the fun in visiting a brewery is trying new things.

Synchronicity - Their description was really accurate.  This is a light saison brewed with blood orange oolong tea and I could taste a dominant citrus note with a medium bitter black tea with a hint of really floral honey in the back.  I thought this was really interesting take on beer and liked trying it.  It did also have a moderate bitterness and touch of the astringency that I've come to know some teas have.  Not my preference but I liked trying it and think the brew masters have creative ideas.  3.5/5  

God Complex - Another saison but with a kick of 9.5% alcohol.  I think my taste buds broke on this one.  They explain it with as spiced, candied orange, floral, and hint of banana.  I ... couldnt taste any of that.  I found the flavour profile really subtle of the 4 we tried.  I'm going to sound like a completely unseasoned drinker (which is not untrue) ... but it was light tasting with a hint of sweetness.  That's it.  Just light dry beer.  Yeah... my tastebuds didnt work here.  3.5/5

Truth Serum - This one was really interesting.  Double dry hopped and with oats, this supposedly had mango, passionfruit, mandarin, and grapefruit notes.  I do have to agree, it has a tropical fruit spin to it... but the first hits you as pineapple sweet and then quickly goes into more of a traditional beer bitterness.  For those who thinking new IPAs are like juice, this could be your gateway drug .. uh drink to liking the newer offerings.  I guess this would be my first step in appreciating more of the traditional flavours of beer.  3.5/5

Hawaiian Stout - I love coffee (if you havent noticed my reviews) and when I saw Rorschach had a whole page of these coffee stouts, I was impressed.  When I sipped this, I can fully appreciate how they nicely blended two flavours that most people would question.  I personally liked it... I couldn't do more of a few sips but I like how the beer had an opening like a cold brew.   Pronounced smooth coffee notes going into a traditional moderated bitterness.  I found this less bitter than Truth Serum.   3.5/5  

So I do have to knock the rating down from a 4 because unfortunately pretty much all the beers I wanted to try were sold out (Latent construct, Systematic Desensitization, Hedonism, ...).  I can understand limited edition ones are 'first come first serve' so I dont think thats them being unprepared.  It's unfortunate to find so many stamped out for the Saturday.  I'm hoping they do come out with more sour or saison for me to try... I'd be willing to come back and see what they offer."}
{"text":"Such a cute little spot in the east end. Great upstairs patio and a really nice tap menu, lots of selection. The samples are small for 3 bucks, but a good way to see what you like. The food looked quite delicious as well but I only went for the beers!"}
{"text":"Upon the suggestion of a friend we ventured here on a Sunday afternoon. We have visited many breweries in the Ontario area and I rank this one quite highly. The brews are well explained and stray (thankfully) from being exclusively IPAs. I enjoyed the Normopathy Pilsner, my friend had Participation Mystique. Both above average. We also enjoyed the pork sliders for $11 each. Delicious and filling. Service was well above average with an attractive staff. Will return when I am in the East End."}
