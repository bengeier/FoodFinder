{"text":"The vibe in this place is unwelcoming. The service was bad because most of the workers acted like they didn't want to be there. They don't portion it right and they give you attitude when you ask for anything different. The food was alright."}
{"text":"Wow, great concept very poor execution! NOT fast at all! Poor management and the girl helping us openly admitted to us she had no clue what to do. We had to asked twice for her to put our pizza in the oven. 20 minutes later we got the pizza and we still had not paid. My very honest husband paid for all of our food. We could have just sat down and ate out food. It was kind of entertaining to see the people who ordered online and they still had no pizza. One guy was there from the time we walked in until we finished eating and left finally with his poor pizzas! I sure hope they were free because that poor man was going to go ape shit! So not very recommended the pizza it was OK."}
{"text":"Just left Pizza Rev and had the BEST experience!! I brought 15 friends/family for dinner tonight.  It was my son's 10th birthday and the staff couldn't be more accommodating!! They were so patient with all the kids and were so professional!! The pizza was GREAT and we can't wait to come back!!! The staff sang Happy Birthday and brought out dessert too!! I want to recognize this group of staff tonight and thank them for a great evening!!! Thank you thank you thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Although not advertised as such but I would call this gourmet pizza ..super fresh, delicious pizza for an amazing price! Super friendly team ...Brandon, the Asst Manager is so super hospitable...he made us feel very welcome ...we'll definitely be back with friends for sure !"}
{"text":"Soooooo...  Imagine making major vacay plans to go to Las Vegas. And include in your vacay planning to go to some of the major, upscale restaurants on the strip, including top named chef restaurant. Imagine securing reservations and how much you were going to enjoy rubbing elbows with the best and exciting your tastebuds with something new.  Now....  On the first day in Vegas, we dropped into a pizza place and picked up something to tide us over. I'd never heard of this place, and I was excited to be able to make my own pizza.  Long story short, we ate here as many times as we could. And even cancelled our last night reservations to make our own pizza.  We walked the strip exciting our tastebuds with our own creations."}
{"text":"Pizza Rev, LEGIT! The pizza and the workers surpasses the ones over at pieology (Downtown summerlin location to be exact).A+. They don't rush through making your order like pieology does and sure as f**k dont burn your pizza! That's what counts. Costumer service. Good vibes here and good food. Good job to the team of PIZZA REV. #PIEOLOGYaintshit"}
{"text":"I love love love this place and I told my sister in law who is vegan that they have the vegan cheese that she likes !! I wish I could give 5 stars however I feel like there is some room for improvement. I ONLY get ricotta cheese on my pizza and since this is a BYO PIZZA  we should be ask what kind of cheese we want just like we are asked for the toppings. I have been in many times and after I choose my sauce they automatically start putting mozzarella cheese. And I have to stop them. It's waste of product and can be avoided by simply asking \"what kind of cheese would you like ? \"  besides that the place is always clean staff is friendly and the pizza always tastes good."}
{"text":"I'm a picky eater so when I say something is good you know it's good! The food was fantastic (it's like the pizza version of chipotle but even better) and the staff was wonderful, especially the assistant manager Brandon who made sure our experience here was the best possible!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is as good as you make it! They NEED a second soda machine though cause you might choke waiting to get a drink!"}
{"text":"Completely upset about this experience,  I went on a Friday at lunch and when I arrived there were only two customers in line.    I placed my order with the dough person, then waited for the next gal in line to do the sauce and cheese process, she apparently needed more experience. It took her FOREVER to do the previous order of three pizzas and finally she started on mine, someone came from the back with a call in order and she stopped mid sauce on my pizza and started that order of 3 pizzas, all the while the rest of the crew waited for her to finish the sauce and pizza process so they could place the toppings and hand the pizzas to be cooked in the oven.  The next few employees in the prepping line looked rather anxious as the line began to build, finally my pizza was pushed down to the next guy and given to the oven guy, relieved as I have only an hour for lunch, I paid, got my drink and began waiting for my name to be called.   20 mins passed, I began to become anxious, I asked the guy working the register, \"how much longer\"  to which I was told they'd call my name when it was ready, I explained that  other people who had placed their orders after me were eatting, asking  him to double check. he  replied, \"we're a little busy!\" by then the line to order was to the door. Another lady came up, asking about her order also upset, finally my name was called! Only they weren't giving me the right pizza, so after another few minutes, apparently it was decide...my pizza was accidentally given to someone else. A male manager came over to the register, began to issue a refund for my pizza, handing me the cash and never apologized or anything. Needless to say I was upset that I was still hungry, late back to work and had been treated poorly.   If this is the new revolution in pizza, I think I'll pass."}
{"text":"Awsome pizza even better customer service ! Friendly as soon as u walk in they scream welcome!!!  They have a beer tap wall which is pure genius we're you pour your own beers ! I would def return ! Octavio & issaha great provided great customer service ."}
{"text":"I'm always up for PizzaRev. But this locations customer service sucks. I walked in and all the workers were in a group looked at me didn't say a single word and continued to talk about nonsense. A couple of them were on their phone. I would have given it TWO stars but the pizza is still amazing. The workers were rude and disrespectful. I'm not sure if this was just because of this particular group of employees or what. I'd rather drive all the way to the one on 215 and rainbow. Even though this location is 10 minutes away from me."}
{"text":"We used to frequent Pizza Rev a couple of times each week.  We loved their pizza and their service.  Until the day there was glass in my partners pizza. So we were eating and all of a sudden she chomped into something hard. After retrieving the item from her mouth we discovered it was glass.  So we put some thought into it and said that perhaps it was from the hot sauce bottle which made of glass. I don't think this was the case.  We told the person in charge and that we thought maybe it was the bottle but then one of the workers went and got all of the hot sauce bottles and took them to the back to \"be checked\".  But before she was finished she said, \" I heard that you had glass in your food\".  It was pretty creepy.  Upon further inspection of the remainding pizza, there was additional glass found and we just can imagine going back.  Now we pay 5 dollars more and eat across the street at Blaze."}
{"text":"Was good when they first opened, now they don't seem to care and have gone skimpy with the toppings. I had to ask for extra cheese 3 times. The young black girl that made my pizza had a lousy attitude. She obviously did not want to be there and showed it. Won't be returning. Thier pizza isn't that great anyway.."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open and was extremely disappointed when we finally visited. The line went to the door but we didn't wait too long to order. The restaurant was very loud and was a little messy. It was difficult to find a clean table. I just figured it was due to how busy it was.  My husband ordered the double crust so I chose the original thin crust pizza. I also ordered a side Caesar salad. The ordering process was not very organized to begin with. They took your order and wrote your name on the paper that the pizza crust was placed on. After tells the next person what you wanted on your pizza, it was ready to go in the oven and you proceed to pay. We paid, got our drinks and found a place to sit and wait.  They call out your name when your pizza comes out which adds to the loud atmosphere and on top of it they seem to struggle to read the names they have written down as many of the papers get burned while baking and erases the name. Finally, after my husband and I received both pizzas we tried it. I was so disappointed in the taste of the sauce! It tasted like canned tomato sauce and the crust was extremely thin and looked like it was precooked. My husbands pizza was kept longer because of the double crust and you could see by the burnt paper underneath that it was in the oven a while yet his cheese wasn't even melted! This pizza was NOT good at all! Great concept (although it's not so new anymore) but not good. Save your money and don't try the new place--- go to Pizza Kitchen on Fort Apache instead. They are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I really like Pizza rev, I really do, but if your going to advertise unlimited toppings then that is what it should be. If I ask for extra cheese, that means extra cheese. That means I shouldn't see sauce. My pizza last Tuesday basically had no cheese on it. Then when I ask for extra cheese the person look at me like committed a mortal sin. Oh and there must be pepperoni shortage or something because putting only 5 on a pizza is laughable. Can we be a little more loose with the toppings."}
{"text":"This ain't pizza.  I might be spoiled growing up in the NY/NJ metro area,but this was pretty lame.I could make better pizza in my toaster oven on an english muffin.Living in Vegas 11 years now,and this is probably the worst I have had.  On top of everything else it takes forever,why does it take 20 minutes to place your order when only 6 or 7 people in line.Employees horribly slow and deliberately stingy with the toppings.  Crust,nothing special and tasteless,Frozen pizza from the lunch line in elementary school is better.Spicy sauce overpowering and you can't taste any toppings.Sauce was super thick like just eating straight tomato paste.EXTREMELY CHEAP WITH THE TOPPINGS.Did all veggie and they put like 2 or 3 pieces of each topping on.What a joke.....What is 3 pieces of basil gonna do?(all 3 pieces maybe equaled 1 basil leaf).Same issue with all toppings.  I guess in an emergency it's certainly edible,But even Little Caesars blows this place away sadly.  Great concept,but horribly executed.Yes,if you look across the street there are MUCH better options that this so called \"pizza\"."}
{"text":"came here for the first time and I would assume they'd be professional and respectable, but I guess not. the workers here are loud and joke around too much and seem to enjoy doing anything but their job. although there are some that do take it seriously and are respectable.   now the pizzas are good, but insanely greasy and way too saucy. lots of napkins needed. we had a relatively big order, and in the middle of it they burned one of our pizzas. we waited for 20 minutes when it's usually done in probably 5. nothing was really done to apologize for this, and even worse they were attending and joking with other customers while we were butt last. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We stopped by to have a dinner with kids and got few pizzas and a salad. If kids don't like pizza it must be really bad (they said that even the school district one is better). One of the pizzas was ordered on thicker crust and came out all burnt under. We returned it and were told that this crust burns easier... so what?? if they know about it why not adjust the cooking time appropriately. When making pizza they didn't just brush the crust with little oil... they poured a whole bunch. Pizza was so greasy that my wife couldn't even eat more than 2 tiny slices.   Salads look like an afterthought idea to sell to people that can't have their greasy pizza.   I guess the idea of making your own unlimited topping pizza is great and there is a bunch of the similar type of places opened up recently. It's just PizzaRev failed miserably to deliver on it's fancy promise... I'd go to The Pizza Kitchen any day over this one."}
{"text":"Customer Service was terrible. I asked if I could get a certain pizza and the guy replied with a \"well can you?\" WTF. Also every time an employee would walk in all the employees behind the counter would obnoxiously scream. WTF. Pizza was whatever, was not worth the price I paid."}
{"text":"It does what it does very well!  1st off you can get pizza anywhere, but I'm so glad Pizza Rev decided to come to my neighborhood.  The customer service is excellent....consistently excellent....staff is so polite they stand out among other Las Vegas businesses.    Then there's the choices....thin crust or regular....the offering of a thin crust means I can visit here more often than once a century....it's just enough crust to hold together all the goodness on top; then you choose the sauce, 4 options including a flavorful organic tomato option; then the cheese options including feta; then the veggies including fresh herbs, sun dried tomatoes, and pineapple; then the meats, including chicken and bacon bits...3 minutes to cook and fresh, crispy, yumminess awaits.    There is of course the wide selection of beers by the electronic beer tap system which is pretty cool...u r bound to find a nice complement to your pizza and/or salad....I forgot to mention the salads available made of the same fresh quality, ingredients.  One thing I would like to see is a wider selection of wines...there is only 1 white & 1 red....both r fine but my wine lovers get jealous of all the beer options.     All in all well done Pizza Rev and welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places I've been to. The staff was very helpful and energetic, and seemed to really love their jobs. Great vegan selections with unlimited toppings. There was also a wide range of different beers on tap, and a couple wine selections. Great for a family outing, date, or even a business lunch. Awesome environment. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night.. $6 Pizza special on Tuesdays! Friendly workers, variety of toppings to choose from. I got the thin and it was perfectly baked. Crust was crisp and ingredients were fresh, organic pizza sauce was yummy. I pick Pizza Rev over Pieology any day!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My family eats here often and it's delicious everytime.  The staff if wonderful and has great customer service! The managers are awesome and accomdating even when it's comes to a kids pizza! We are very pleased with this place and would recommend to anyone and bring our friends and family back. Keep up the great pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my girl love Pizzarev. We come every Tuesday for the 6 dollar pizzas. There is always an awesome crew every Tuesday. Jessica, Destiny and Brandon are always here it seems like. All three are always so great and welcoming. Definitely keep us coming back!"}
{"text":"I used to love this location, but where did the tall day manager go? Since he has been gone this place seems like a huge mess! Lobby not clean & burnt pizza seems like no one paying attention! Whats going on!?"}
{"text":"Build your own pizza with the skimpiest distribution of toppings & staff that act so entitled.  4 slices of pepperoni & sprinkled mozzarella.  Don't waste your time, this place won't be around long"}
{"text":"This the closest to Chicago Style Thin crust we've found in Vegas and we LOVE it!!! Brandon makes the BEST pizzas!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for a quick pizza. Ingredients are of a good quality and taste proved it. It took longer to pick what I wanted and get through the line then I did waiting.  I did find the crispy thin crust a bit too crispy. May be how they do it or I just got one that was a little extra done.  Overall a great place to take the family for dinner or lunch. Clean place and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"The pizza was great, the atmosphere is very nice and chill, the thursday night crew made the experience awesome, definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Found this chain when we were visiting San Diego and were so excited to see that they opened one here in town! It's hard to find a good gluten free pizza but this places manages to do it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Custom, fast, and fresh pizza and salads!  A wide array of ingredients to choose from at no additional cost! Great customer service! It was super busy since it was the grand opening, will definitely come back again =)"}
{"text":"Fast service! Great food! Friendly staff. So awesome to sit down and eat yummy pizza without waiting a decade!"}
{"text":"I love this place !!!! The concept, the vibe an the friendliness of the staff. Every tuesday u can get ur pizza for 6$! That means ur very own unlimited topping pizza! U may think their small but they do fill u up!"}
{"text":"I am not a pizza snob by any means. I just enjoy a good slice.  So tonight I thought why not try PizzaRev.  Sadly not very impressed, it was just so-so.  Probably won't drive not of my away to go here.  Not bad enough to not give it another shot in the future."}
{"text":"Thomas, Neisha, and Octavio Always greet us with a warm welcome and a SMILE!!! They are AWESOME the pizzas are AMAZING....keep us coming back once or twice a week"}
{"text":"**This review is solely based on customer service** I don't think it's professional for workers to make gagging noises and faces when they see what toppings some customers put on their pizza. Hey, each their own but you mortified and publicly shamed the young lady who was in front of us ordering. Please train your workers to have more respect for their customers. Save the disgusted looks for when you're not in front of them."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with my husband and we both were a little disappointed in the pizza.   This is a casual, fast-fired, make your own pizza place set up similar to Chipotle/Cafe Rio.   They offer three crusts, thin, double crust, or gluten free. We both had the thin crust. It was comparable to a cracker. It was very thin, didn't fold well. Almost too crisp like an unsalted saltine cracker.  Sauces include red, white and bbq. We both ordered a pizza with red sauce. The red sauce is comparable to canned tomato paste that is watered down to pizza sauce consistency, which is not very good.   The cheese options is italian, ricotta, bleu, feta and low fat italian.   The selection of toppings ranged from meatballs to arugula and of course classics like pepperoni. I was looking for salami, pesto and roasted garlic, but did not see any.   They have tea and one of those soda selection machines. They also had hot sauce, peppers, cheese and oregano next to the soda machine.  Overall, the customer service was amazing. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. Service was quick and the line was moving. It is grand opening week so they were doing a charity event. Pizza was the price of a donation. There is outside seating and ample seatin indoors as well. They also have beer available. The usual price for a custom pizza is $7.99. They have a kids pizza as well.   I really tried to like this place, but after having Blaze Pizza, this place doesn't come close. Next time I'm in the area and craving pizza, I will head down the street to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Very slow and the line where you order your pizza, I had to get the Manager because we were at a stand still for awhile. She got things moving for us. pizza came out good but Blaze Pizza is much faster and getting ppl through the line"}
{"text":"White mushroom pizza is great. The fennel and sausage is very good. Built your own or pick one. Our first visit today. The man who created and took our order is well served at the position. Highly recommend. Give it a shoot."}
{"text":"Love this place. Got there once after closing time and Brandon let us in anyways. Love their customer service!"}
{"text":"My first introduction to a concept like PizzaRev was Project Pie in the MGM Grand. Living out in Henderson, and wanting to avoid the strip, I was hoping to see PP expand out. There are quite a few in the San Diego area. However, that has not been the case. However I do still like their pizza, but being in a casino, the prices are a bit more exaggerated than \"freestanding\" locations (MGM Grand's location charges about $12).  From Project: Pie's website, their pizzas run about $8.50 for unlimited toppings.    While standing in line at a Jimmy John's during a promotion, one of PizzaRev's people came over with a free pizza card. Hmm, trying to get some business? Ambitious. I like that.    I took one of the cards and still got my sandwich. Not passing up a $1 slim for JJ's. But, I could enjoy the sandwich later (for dinner). Went over to PizzaRev for my free pizza.    It's located on Sunset closer to Stephanie. There are other shops and restaurants in the area with a shared parking lot in front (Sunset) or in back (off of the Sunset Station \"service/access\" road).   If you've never been to Project: Pie or PizzaRev ... the concept works like this:   It's an 11\" pizza cooked in an open fire oven for 2-3 minutes. The dough is freshly made but pressed down to a nice thin, but not cracker-like crust by a pressing machine. Unlike other chains that stretch it out or roll it out and it is \"doughy\" and tends to puff up (Domino's or Papa John's \"hand-tossed\").    You can get it for dine-in or to-go. And, the price is the same for one or more toppings. PizzaRev? Same deal; but it is cheaper than the PP located at the MGM Grand. No knock on them at all though. PP is smaller, given its location. PizzaRev is a bit bigger though.     PizzaRev has signature and Gluten Free dough. I took signature.   You get to choose your sauce: red, white, BBQ, or olive oil. I got \"light\" red sauce. That worked out great.      Then the cheese! I chose all natural Italian, extra cheese. They do have reduced-fat Italian, feta, bleu, ricotta, and vegan cheeses.    Then the meats or proteins! They have quite a few selections. And, despite unlimited toppings for the price - I went with pepperoni and crumbled meatballs.  Then on to the veggies ... I went with mushrooms. After that? In the oven and I used the \"freebie\" card to pay.    No problems with that and after about three minutes ... I got my pizza, cooked to perfection!    From entry to exit, everyone was friendly, helpful, welcoming, and inviting. Each step of the way they always asked to make sure I had the right pizza and if the portions were acceptable. One of the people apologized several times for the long wait. Having worked at two pizza places, I understood.  By the time I paid, there were only two in-store and two to-go orders ahead of me.   The pizza? I shared it with my mom when I got home. Since we have small appetites, it was definitely a great lunch - perfectly portioned; cut into six (6) pieces. Though, if you have a larger appetite, this was between a small and medium sized pizza, just for reference.    The cheese melts a bit better than what PP uses. However, that wouldn't make me stop going there. Just more \"FYI\" than anything.    PizzaRev serves up carbonated beverages through the Coke FreeStyle machine (I passed on a drink since I got my order to-go), and they even have beer.    I will return again as I have a special sign-up offer, so that's a bonus. But, would I mind paying $8 for the pizza? Sure! It's a great deal.   Don't look at the price and think \"I can get a 3-topping from Domino's\". This is NOTHING like Domino's or any other \"chain\". $8 for unlimited toppings? It's a sure bet for me!    Though, from the way the dough is (durability) ... I'd stay with five (5) toppings. I'd be afraid of them falling off or the crust just disintegrating from the stress.   If Project Pie comes my way, I'll visit them equally. For now? I'm staying with PizzaRev.    I did get a freebie to eat there the first time, though this review is unpaid, and after the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Clean place.  Fresh ingredients.  Pizza was very good.  And, nice team of guys who work there: Kiambi, Thomas, Aiden, Anthony, and Eric."}
{"text":"this place is awesome! !! unlimited toppings and great for something quick. My girl also loves this place cuz it also has Vegan . The workers there are very nice and (Paul) is very helpful and all about customer service great place"}
{"text":"I ordered a make your pizza, although they do have signature pizzas on the menu, with the double crust. They have vegan cheese (only $1 additional) which is cool, but I went cheeseless with vegan sausage and tons of veggies. I choose the red sauce and it could have had more flavor. The crust was meh. Not bad. They have a ton of different hot sauces available, including their own. I prefer Blaze Pizza but this place location is closer to the SW side of town."}
{"text":"6 dollar pizza Tuesdays. Great gluten free options. Pizza is extremely fast to make. I go every Tuesday. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time last night and will definitely be back. Made my own pizza and really appreciate the toppings to chose from like fennel sausage, beef and spicy pepperoni, meatball and all the other regular meats you'd expect for pizza. As for veggies I was happy to see artichoke, arugula and garlic, cloves and minced, plus all the other staple toppings. The pizza dough has a really nice taste to make for great pizza experience. The staff was super nice and friendly and the price is just right."}
{"text":"My family loves Pizza rev.  We like that we can each build the kind of pizza we want.  But mostly because I eat gluten free due to celiacs and this is one place I can come and eat and not have a reaction.  They are very careful not to cross contaminate my pizza and are very courteous about the process.  This is our new go to for pizza!!"}
{"text":"Usually my go to place over here in the SW Vegas area. The pizza is phenomenal! Only thing is the service. The Instore workers are decent, they try. But the manger is snoody and has a god-like complex. I overhear him belittling his co-workers and seems like it's his goal to make them feel stupid. This wasn't an issue when Richie was the manager. Richie checked on guests and made it his goal to build everyone in this building up. So until things change, it seems it'll still be an unpleasant visit."}
{"text":"Came here last Tuesday for their $6 pizza deal to get a pizza. I wanted to get one before work to take to work; so I was running close with time. I am standing in line and while waiting a Child pukes right in the walk way- disgusting!! About throws me off my appetite,  but I'm craving pizza and the price, so even a child projectile vomiting won't get into my way.  I pay ahead becuase I'm in a hurry and pay  at the register. While waiting they finally called my name and it was the wrong pizza. I should have said yes and taken it since I was hungry and in a hurry. But I said no and still waited for my pizza. 10 minutes later they proceed to tell me that they \"f*cked up on my pizza\" and were making me a new one. IM ABOUT TO BE LATE FOR WORK. They said they were sorry and i immediately asked for my money back. Thank you for the heads up way later then expected. when I was in a hurry! It was greatly appreciated!!!! Great pizza spot! Just not for when your in a hurry."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Average pizza, overpriced. Crust was the best thing going.  Not impressed with topping selection...Pass"}
{"text":"I here for the first time today. On its way out of the oven, they dropped my pizza on the ground. No one informed me that this had happened when it did. After approaching the counter to see why my food was taking so long, it took several minutes for anyone to even acknowledge me standing there. They told me my pizza was dropped on the ground it was just going to take a few minutes longer. By the time the food was done, my friends were already almost done with their food. They remade the pizza by memory instead of asking me what was on it and it ended up having 3 missing toppings. At this point they said sorry and offered me a buy 1 get 1 coupon for next visit. This is absolutely absurd of for them to do so many things wrong then to just offer me a buy 1 get 1 instead of an immediate refund or even a free pizza for next visit."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat.the food is really good the delicious pizza  They have Yummy yummy.It's very clean and the  employee are very nice to Thanks"}
{"text":"Really polite employees, good pizza and the best is the beer sold by the amount you drink"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying PizzaRev and I have to say I like them a lot better than pieology. The staff at this particular location was amazingly friendly and attentive. I had only ordered a pizza to go and when I declined a drink they offered me a water cup while I was waiting. It was a nice touch for a place that I consider fast food. My only real complaint with the pizza was that I ordered it with extra basil and it seemed to not have that distinct basil flavor. Other than that everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, they messed up our order. And to make it worse, they did a poor job in creating our second order."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend came here the first week they opened and every week since then. The pizza is amazing and have a great crew working. The pizza are quick and delicious. A must go for any fan of pizza."}
{"text":"We love Pizza Rev! !! White sauce & thin crust ...mmm...delish!! My 7yr. Old not a huge pizza fan but at Pizza Rev he smashed the entire thing. Great staff!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited about the format of this restaurant. Like Chipotle, but for pizza.  The thin crust was delicious and I enjoyed their choice of toppings. Not over priced in my opinion. However, ALL of the staff we encountered seemed so miserable that we literally wanted to walk out half way through ordering. I'm disappointed to say that we felt like they were so slow, uninformed about the menu and just seemed absolutely miserable. Sad."}
{"text":"Pizzarev on Rancho is awesome!!  The food is excellent and the service is even better!  Everyone was friendly and helpful...especially Thomas at the register, he made our visit memorable and fun!!!  We will definitely be back, thank you!!"}
{"text":"This place is very nice I love the pizza here and how you can put on as many toppings as your heart desires!!! Not to mention the service was impeccable, whoever is in charge of this location is doing a phenomenal job love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, I'm still giving decent review  the pizza was good however, they did not tell me that they did not have all the ingredients to my pizza before making it, they let me know after. I wanted to be a good sport and said it was fine, also the place was a mess tables were not clean!! Only guys we're working here at the time talking about sports while the water dispenser was corroded had not been clean possibly in a long time.."}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't terrible.  If this review was based on food alone I would give a 4/5.  Unfortunately it's not.  That being said, the service was atrocious.  After waiting 15 minutes for my pizza to come out of the oven; I approached the employee at the counter to only find out that my pizza was given to another customer.  Needless to say I had to wait another 10 minutes.  I wasn't the only customer who was experiencing issues.   This place does have potential, hopefully management implements better organization."}
{"text":"Choose this place on a whim because the place we were heading to was closed for a private party.  So glad we did.  The pizza is fabulous and everyone can make their own.  And no matter how many toppings it's the same cost."}
{"text":"I'm here religiously every Tues with coworkers. Can't beat $6 for unlimited toppings! Multiple sauces to choose from. The Desert pizza is awesome too. Great customer service and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great price. We had to take the picture before it was gone!!  One size and lots of topping for low price.  Will definitely will make this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I crave it now! I love that you can choose what you want on your pizza and the pesto drizzle and gluten free crust is so good!! I wish they sold the garlic habanero hot sauce though! Please!"}
{"text":"Monday night crew is bomb !!! They're so nice and funny and kept it LIT IN THERE. Great service and the employees are super helpful and the food is fresh. :) Thanks y'all"}
{"text":"Great pizza with a great price. On Tuesdays every pizza is only $6. Otherwise, is $8. Very delicious."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed the pizza is the bomb and they greet you as you enter the service is excellent everyone is so polite they even say thank you when you are leaving. Love it keep up the great service. We are definitely coming back. Thanks Pizza Rev!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The craft your own pizza concept is a great idea! I'm a fan of thin crust so this place was great for me! For $7.99 have as many toppings as you want! The menu very simple. Restaurant is a decent size and clean. Staff are nice. Self serve beverage station is always good. Definitely will be a regular here."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good! Staff does a great job especially with how busy they seem to get they handle it like champs! Manager is amazing she does a wonderful job and is very good at what she does. Will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Not great. Manager berated an employee in middle of our order and while the employee was taking another order. Asked for a BBQ chicken pizza then had to repeat the order to every person on the line.   Me: \"I had the BBQ chicken\" Pizza Rev: \"Okay, what did you want on it?\" Me: \"Whatever is on the BBQ chicken...\"  Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"I love the concept. Fresh, organic ingredients with gluten free option, build-your-own pizza. The line was super long, but understandable with it being their grand opening week. Nothing impressive about the taste of the pizza. Definitely wasn't worth the wait or the money."}
{"text":"Tried Pizza Rev for the first time, tonight and was not overly pleased.  When I asked about certain ingredients for the toppings, none of the staff seem to know the answer.  I'm Gluten Intolerant and need to know precisely what each topping includes (due to my allergy).  Their lack luster response was not reassuring.  Once I got the pizza home, I found a human hair in one of the slices.  I stopped eating the remaining pieces, immediately. Yuck!  Unfortunately, this was my first and will be my last time at Pizza Rev.  Thumbs Down!!"}
{"text":"I love this place for a quick pizza dinner. Really good pizza with fresh ingredients. I love how there are many options for my pizza. I do think a brush of olive oil on the crust after the pizza comes out of the over would just put the pizza over the top."}
{"text":"I love me some za and all these build your own places opening up in recent years are amazing so I had to try this place out. This was the closest location for me.  I wasn't super impressed with the options as compared to other places. I also wasn't super impressed with my pizza. The chicken I got on top was still somewhat cold by the time I ate it but the rest of the pizza was hot. I did like the option of different type of crust options though. Overall not my first pick of a pizza place."}
{"text":"Blaze was my favorite. I didn't think any crust could be thinner and crispier. Friendly staff. Nice clean place. Great food,  and super reasonable. Pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place but apparently they are only unlimited toppings for certain people or items. I asked for extra cheese and was given an attitude. Then after I get a little more cheese and the 5 pieces of meat I was allowed. I asked for more cheese and was told \"our district manager wouldn't like this amount of cheese\" the person behind me is told you get unlimited toppings. I ask for more cheese, since I'm only getting a cheese and pepperoni pizza but they refuse and only offer feta and goat cheese. Sad they are about to lose a customer and they don't care. Just know they are stingy with the cheese and toppings"}
{"text":"This place is so good I definitely recommend to anyone! I got the Mediterranean pizza and added pepperoni instead of black olives and it was delicious! My boyfriend made his own and he loved it as well! The best part is you only pay for the crust and all toppings are free! We will for sure be coming back."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times before for dinner. Came in tonight to grab pizza to go. Seems like the customer service has gone down. Employees seem monotoned and not super friendly. Not to mention while we were waiting to pay we could see the back kitchen area. And an employee was running back and forth doing stuff barefoot! Gross! The cashier wasn't to nice either and was cutting pizza without gloves after handling money."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. They have a ton of staff. Staff was loud and seemed poorly managed. Not as professional as when it first opened, store was kind of messy also."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place. No matter what day of the week it is I can't help but to drop in to order a pizza for lunch and one to go. Everything always tastes great and the manager Brandon is awesome! I would def recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a pizza spot open that you could make yourself with one low price we went about 45 mins before closing took our pizza to go they weren't cooked long enough & we didn't really like them. Maybe it was just because they had recently opened but we prob won't be checking it out again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was great. The employees are amazing!  Ask for Isaiah for help and he won't steer you wrong."}
{"text":"Quick, delicious pizza at a good price! Love the crust here too! Try it if you're in the area and have a pizza craving!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! They'll literally make you laugh and smile as you go through the line making your pizza! Who ever sees a GM hands on! RARE!!! The pizza is absolutely the best! Pleased!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the cost and quality of the pizza here.  Management and staff seem to always be having fun which makes the environment on par with the food."}
{"text":"The team at Pizza Rev are awesome and helpful. The restaurant is clean and the food is delicious! Great place to bring the kids. Great new way to have pizza your way!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at pizza rev 5 times since they opened and I will agree with others that the sauce is a bit bland however you can put as many toppings on your pizza you like for $8,  $6 on rev Tuesdays so put on the spicy pepperoni the sausage and other spicy toppings to give it that extra kick  And overtime I am sure they will streamline the process to make it faster but right now everyone is so new that they aren't quite up to speed   A helpful tip if your in a hurry call ahead and order and don't go on Tuesdays"}
{"text":"Dear Mister Pizza Manager Brandon, even though we don't share the same enthusiasm about the great franchise of the Los Angeles Dodgers, we do share the common love for pizza and service. This has been my second time visiting and it's really great to have a manager be hands on with his crew and have an uplifting spirit. Great pizza and phenomenal service."}
{"text":"So today my husband & i decided we wanted pizza rev for dinner, to save a little time since we had our littles with us we used the app to place our order and that way our pizza would be paid for and be made in time to just stop in and pick it up. Wrong! When my husband went into the shop, they were just barely starting to make it, the annoying thing is that if you are not  standing their watching them and telling them what toppings you want they put all the toppings in the center. I don't really  understand why? Would they want all the toppings right in the center ? Instead of being spread around? Also they are very stingy with the toppings, my husband had \"6\" pepperoni slices on his pineapple and pepperoni pizza. Prices were raised for double dough so its a little unfair how toppings are so restricted, also if you ask for extra they'll add one more."}
{"text":"Best PizzaRev location I have been to Sahara and Rancho in Las Vegas.  Great staff and pizza is created to perfection!"}
{"text":"Love the double-dough and the pizzas all around. Tried a similar diy pizza place and this one wins hands down. Great spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"Pizza is one of those things that if it's bad it's still pretty good. Unfortunately this is one of those times where I just was completely unsatisfied I've had better frozen pizza wait strike that I've had better dollar frozen pizzas. Ordered online using the pick up method because I was told I couldn't call in my order. The place is clean and bright and weld it nicely decorated was a long line of people waiting to get their pizzas. This is sort of like the McDonald's of pizza, do not believe the hype they have choices for different sauces I chose spicy no flavor whatsoever the crust was burnt around the edges as you can see from the photo it tastes just like it looks no flavor"}
{"text":"This is your classic build-your-own pizza place, but PizzaRev has perfected this craft. They are always rolling out dough and have them ready to go, so the wait time from making to getting your prepped pizza is only 10-15 minutes. They have a plethora of toppings among the sauces, cheeses, veggies, and meats. My go-to is regular dough, original tomato sauce, mozzarella, roasted garlic, onions, basil, fresh tomatoes, fennel sausage, and Italian sausage (and extra of it). The pizza crust is thin and crispy, the cheese is gooey, and both sausages were flavorful. The fennel sausage is my particular favorite, where the fennel is very apparent and is not used sparingly in the sausage bits. The veggies are fresh and adds extra flavor to the pizza, with the onion giving an extra crunch to the entire pizza. The roasted garlic adds a slight sweet and nuttiness to the pizza.   Another plus about PizzaRev is their beer tap. It's like an adult slushie machine, where you are free to get whatever beer you want at whatever time you choose (as long as you have the bracelet stating you are of age to drink and can pay for what you get).   In addition, PizzaRev also is able to do fundraisers for any event and have a quick turn around in helping you set this up. They only need about a week or two to set this up. I personally had a fundraiser done by them, and within 9 days, everything was set up for it.  Overall my experiences with PizzaRev has always been good. It's a great place to get a fresh, cheap pizza the way I want and they are always welcoming to all their guests."}
{"text":"1 margherita, 1 fennel and sausage.....awesome. Great job, Dakota and crew. Oh and a Tenaya Creek beer."}
{"text":"Was really tasty until I found hair in my pizza. Postmates delivered it so I couldn't do much. Ruined my experience"}
{"text":"I went here twice, I was hoping it would be better the second time but I was a bit disappointed. I read some people compare the sauce to canned Ragu. I SWEAR that's exactly what it is! I had a jar of Ragu at home and could not taste any difference. I don't know why they call it double dough it is still pretty thin and its not fresh its frozen, the cheese is pretty good but when they didn't give me very much cheese I asked for more all they put on was a tiny bit more. I had to say \"I like LOTS AND LOTS OF CHEESE\" and they looked at me like I was expecting too much. they're kinda chinsey on the cheese. I know cheese isn't exactly cheap but why advertise I can have as many I want then bitch when I want more than you thought? I tried it 2 times but I don't think ill go back again. I think I will go next door to Albertsons, grab a boboli crust, some tomatoes and cheese and make my own pizza way better...."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go when you want good quality pizza and don't have time to wait half an hour! It's like the pizza version of Subway. 1 pizza is just enough for 2 people. Tuesdays are $6 pizza days!"}
{"text":"Pizza Rev is my favorite! I feel so lucky to have this place so close to me. Yea, it's just like any other generic build-your-own-pizza place, but it's delicious. They have so many options for the crust but I always stick to the thin crust. It's so good and no extra charge. I love their choices of toppings. The artichoke hearts are so good and I have to get the ricotta cheese. Sometimes I go unhealthy and get the Alfredo sauce. I love it. On Tuesdays it's only $6 for a pizza! And the pizza is a pretty big size. I can barely eat a whole one, it's really filling. It's a great deal and even on other days prices are good. They are so fast at making your pizza and service is always super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Wow. Just Wow, the employee seemed like she was on heroin, put pepperoni and arugula and green peppers on a Margherita pizza... I guess the cashier/ acting manager gave a 10% discount, but the excuse that everything is new is terrible... it's only the most common/popular pizza in the world... Obviously a problem with management, new location and already filthy, 6 dirty tables with 4 guests only at 1:45 in the afternoon and 5+ employees standing around and chatting. I was tempted to just leave without eating, but needless to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"Good stuff make your own I had Hawaiian style ham pineapple and smiley bbq sauce. Hmmmm"}
{"text":"Good fresh made to order Pizza. Made right in front of you any way you want. Great service as well; everyone making sure you are happy with everything. A little loud atmosphere but otherwise nice.  Worth the trip. Great for families."}
{"text":"This place is like a \"subway\" but for pizza. Tuesday's is $6 for any pizza, any toppings. It's usually two or three meals for me, and totally worth $6. I enjoy this place and the employees have great attitudes."}
{"text":"Went in and ordered a pizza and beer (perfect pair) and a side salad. (I saw the sign for the $2.99 add on).  Looking at my receipt I was charged separate for each item.   Went back to counter with receipt and asked for clarification and was told that I was charged the higher price for the salad because I did not take a drink. I took a water cup and it get the lesser price I need to get a drink and salad.   Um, ok I will next time throw away a drink!  Then he looks at the beer and he says oh well we messed up on the perfect pair.   Sorry about that.    Yep that was the solution. Sorry? No offer to refund and make it right, no same value coupon for next visit.   Just a shrug of a shoulder and a sorry about that.    Not a happy customer right now."}
{"text":"I had this book marked to try. So glad I finally did!! I loved it! My kids enjoyed it. Everyone got to choose their own thickness of crust and their own toppings on the pizza. Everyone was happy. And all for a great price!! The employees were very friendly and patient with each of us taking our time to decide, there were 6 of us. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great customer service definitely stands out !!!! Thomas made an amazing pizza and atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza Subway-style. Create your own. Regular crust is like a cracker and double dough is more like hand tossed."}
{"text":"Isaiah and Carlos are the homies!!! This place is environmentally friendly and the whole staff was wonderful!"}
{"text":"It was a bummer that they don't do the $6 promo like the one on rainbow and warm springs. But the 5 stars goes to all the staff that gave good customer service!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted with the fakest welcoming. The menu is super confusing and the twilight associate could less if we understood."}
{"text":"Eh...not my fav. Custom made pizza place. The dough is kind of on the stale side and It did not remain crunchy by the time I got home. Choices of ingredients is not abundant compared to other custom pizza places and tasted bland. Time to search for a new place to try my custom pizza."}
{"text":"Hit the spot. Had been craving pizza all week and did not feel like purchasing all the fixings I wanted to make my own. This place was pretty good. Thought I was at chipotle a little bit with the conveyor belt process of a build your own. But it was ok... you gotta watch the person making your pizza... I ended up with double spinach cause dude lost track of what pizza he was working on. Not complaining cause I love the green. Just saying. I was paying for the group and two people in our group were already at the register and the employee kinda rushed the process and one drink got ordered for the table. Very distracting trying to build my pizza 10ft away and try to pay the bill at the same time. After you create your own the pie gets tossed in the oven and stood there waiting for several minutes. Realizing we didn't have a beverage I decided I wanted a beer. Oh yeah they have beer. On tap and in bottles. Now hold it.. as We are standing at the register now.. going on like 10m. No one has been at the register. The line has piled up.. our pizza is cooling off and we're getting hangry. I notice in this time that you can get ANY PIZZA and a BEER for 9.95. This combo is confusing to me as the pizza I ordered was that alone because the \"thick\"crust option is a high price. So hint... get the original thin crust. So finally some girl comes from the back and says because we already paid for the food (remember when we were rushed through) we had to pay again for the beer. Even though based on their advertising.... I should have a BEER in my hand. We paid extra for the beer because well.. pizza and beer. So all in all the key is original crust and get your beer at the register. Also.. just like most places being vegan or offering vegan options, your are paying a premium (extortion) for this.. like 1$ charge for vegan cheese (daiya) and then receiving a fraction of the amount of cheese as to be compared to a dairy pizza. I would be back for the convenience of it. But would not at all make it a habit as it's not that special."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Excellent service. Being vegan I have been looking for a good pizza place in my area. They offer vegan cheese and a great selection of veggies! The employees are very friendly, one offered to change his gloves bc he didn't want to contaminate my pizza with dairy, extremely thoughtful. I will definetly be returning. Thank you for a great eating experience."}
{"text":"Below average customer service, very limited options for the pizza, information in store is often different than the website. Overall I was dissatisfied with the quality of services offered here. Blaze and Piology both offer the same type of \"create your own\" pizza, however, with a much more pleasant experience and MANY more options.  EDIT: (increase to 3 ) Customer service ended up being above average by the end of the visit. Several of the employees personally see to it that their customers have a good experience."}
{"text":"The best thin and crispy crust and phenomenal toppings along with courteous and professional service. 5- stars as far as i am concerned."}
{"text":"All of the staff at this location was amazing! From the time we walked into the restaurant we were greeted and staff was helpful and patient while we selected our toppings. They even brought our pizzas to the table. The pizza was delicious!! Wish I lived closer so I could come back! Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Yesssss! Made to order pizza and great service! I love the dough used at this spot. Even their double dough is still thin and crispy. Toppings are super fresh and service is friendly and fast. I can totally dig going here for pizza and beer, but until I'm no longer pregnant I'll settle for pigging out on some delicious pizza. They have their own combinations to choose from or you can make your own. The kids meals come with a smaller personal pizza, a dessert, and a drink. Great spot for the whole fam!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza I have ever had.  The thin crust is nice and crunchy. The white sauce is great if you don't like red.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Love this place, so quick and convenient especially when we are on the run between activities for the kids in the evening. Also love that everyone gets exactly what they want! Between 4 and 6  pm they have a special where you get a beer or wine with your pizza for $9.95--killer deal!"}
{"text":"It's a build your own pizza restaurant. If your lazy, there is a set menu. Same deal if you want salad, make you own or pick from menu. There are different type of crust to start with, including gluten free. Then you can choose your sauce, with includes a organic sauce. You can chose more than one sauce. There is a few type of cheese, organic cheese is one. The meat selection is anything from different types of sausages, chicken, beef, and bacons. The rest of the toppings to chose from is veggies, herbs and spices. You can add as many toppings as you like. The pizza did not take long to cook, about 10 mins. Great staff. If you download their app, first pizza is free."}
{"text":"Seriously the best staff that has ever worked a restaurant, Naya was such a great host and helped us through our first time at the place deciding what pizza and showed us how to use the beer wall, WHOCH IS AWESOME! The staff were all really awesome. King Kiambis energy was awesome in helping us with the beer selection. I can't tell you how awesome everyone is there!"}
{"text":"The service here was horrible. The workers give you attitude when they ask you what you would like, and get upset when you forget you wanted a topping that was in a different station. Overall the food was alright (reason for it being two stars instead of one). I wouldn't go again and I recommend you don't go."}
{"text":"Awesome people!! Isaiah super cool dude he congratulated us on our new baby, and there was 2 other girls engaging my wife on the pregnancy , it wasn't a customer employee thing it felt like friends to friends , awesome experience"}
{"text":"Brandon is amazing and full of energy. Definitely love coming here. Service was fast and the pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"Great for vegans. The crust is thin but still a good overall pizza. The staff was not 100% sure about what other items were vegan but that's not that unusual. Overall good and with a little work could be great"}
{"text":"Dined here several times, by far the best create your own pizza in town. You can build your own pizza, choose any sauce, you can do thin crust or double dough (no extra charge for that) and unlimited meat and veggie toppings all for a fixed price of $7.99. Very delicious pizza. My kids always get their Oreo dessert pizza. Our  pizzas were great. They run a Tuesday special of $6 pizzas.  They also serve beer and wine :) all $5 and under by the glass.  The staff is  very friendly and energetic despite being very busy. Joie was excellent, he was the cashier. Would def recommend this place"}
{"text":"First time here. A little confused on how to order. Once I figured it out I ordered the BBQ chicken. Mmmmmm, it was delicious. Came with my family and we all pretty much everything. Even ordered a dessert Oreo pizza. Staff were very friendly. Food didn't take long to make or eat.  I would recommend them to anyone.   Only down fall is Coke products. But that can slide."}
{"text":"Great pizza,super friendly staff.... Octavian (I believe he is one of the managers) made sure everyone in the place was happy and enjoying their meals!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty bothered by my experience here. I had such high hopes for it and it disappointed in almost every aspect.   To start, the flow of the line wasn't functional. As expected, there were a lot of people waiting. The person applying the sauce and cheese took the longest and was by herself, consistently backed up. The toppings employees should have been helping apply the cheese to speed up the line. It took almost 10 minutes in the line before I was even able to place my order.   My next issue, is my biggest issue. This place was absolutely disgusting and dirty. The counter tops were just nasty. Every inch of glass has finger prints and every inch of work space was covered in suave and mashed toppings. The employees putting on toppings NEVER changed their gloves. I watched one employe apply anchovies to a pizza then reach into the pineapples. How gross is this?? I couldn't get over this.....   As for the food, I ordered 2 personal pizzas. The first was a traditional red sauce with traditional toppings (pepperoni, olives, peppers, ect) and my second pizza was a white sauce with bacon and chicken. The first pizza was extremely greasy, and  just ok - it wasn't bad by any means, but not sensational. BUT the second pizza was incredible!! It was the only highlight of my life experience and I'm glad I ordered the white sauce. I would highly recommend it.   Unfortunately for PizzaRev, I probably won't be back due to dirtiness of everything. If they can't keep have pride in wiping down the counters after each customer, then who knows what happens behind closed doors. Hopefully they will fix it before the health district makes them!"}
{"text":"Most likely never coming back.  The service is so shitty and bland.  No one seems to like their job.  Also, there was some black burnt powder under the pizza which was most likely pizza dough that was burnt.  This basically tells me they don't even clean the oven."}
{"text":"First time here and we will definitely be back! Isaiah was incredible friendly and helpful! He made me the \"Isaiah Special\" and it was delicious! And he walked me through downloading the Pizza Rev app to earn free pizzas. Can't wait to try the oreo dessert pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Pizza Rev does $6 Tuesdays and although the line is usually long, it goes by quickly and all the staff is very patient and accommodating. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by thanking Thomas on the night shift for always having the energy and positivity to keep this place up and running. He has a great spirit and you can tell he loves what he does. He is very personable and does great. Every time I come in there his energy gives me life. Now today! I appreciate Eric, Justin and I think her name was Cherise for keeping their composure as they dealt with a difficult nurse that works in the same complex. She was very unprofessional and kept putting her hands through her hair and then draping her hands over the food. I had to speak up on their behalf because that is nasty. I commended them on handling the nurse, the other customers, and us with care and I appreciate that they did not break. I would have gone off on her continuing to put her hands in her hair and then drop them over the protective glass and possibly have her hair in peoples food.  That was unacceptable for a nurse and hope she reads this post because she knows better. Thank you Pizza Rev, for keeping the professionalism and allowing us to take care of it. I know she heard me say that this glass was to protect the food and she even made an attempt to give you compliments after I said something commending you all on your composure. That let me know she was being a complete asshole just because she could. Thomas you are great and you have great co workers as well... I know when people are taking advantage, and I dislike people that think they can use people however they want. It won't be when I'm around. I'll make sure to check them and their unprofessional ways!!! Thank you pizza rev!!! I love the pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious and awesome!! The team that works here is so kind and spirited and so outgoing! If you're new to this concept of pizza you should definitely come and try it!! I will always come back and be a loyal customer because their team here is just the greatest and the food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Thomas was amazing! He really made the experience better and i will definitely come back just because of his customer service!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to get a quick bite. I wound up waiting a little which wasn't a big deal. But o asked for gluten free dough and they needed a minute to prep those ingredients. Again, not a big deal but the gentleman that took care of me REALLY took care of me, and he gave me the pizza for free to make up for it! The pizza was very good, especially at a $7 value. I would absolutely recommend this place bot only for the pizza, but for the kind staff :)"}
{"text":"Young kid with the dreads horrible customer service! I'm a restaurant manager myself and I would remove him if he was in my location! There was a guest standing behind him as he talked on the phone! Then he was on the phone again as a guest was asking for a to go box! The first guest had to grab his own box! Not to mention the other employees look like there fed up with his laziness! But on the upside the pizza was good my wife got a vegan pizza it's nice that you guys offer that as an option! Thanks to the rest of the staff"}
{"text":"Ordered here for delivery, they were quick and great with service. However the pizza just wasn't to our liking. Pizzas were small and nothing significant with the flavor, and a bit expensive for the experience."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since they have opened, and when they did open the customer service was fantastic! Friendly, tentative and smiles.   Today... was a different story for this visit. I had ordered pickup from Yelp. When picking up my order, I genuinely not expecting lack luster customer service from this place what so ever.   I walk in and stand near the cash register to pick up my order. Female employee just stares at me, as if I'm cutting the line ? Not asking what I'm there for until, she finally had to walk over to the register to assist a customer pay. Her aura was salty af, like relax! I'm only here to pick up my order, not rob the place!  After 5-7 minutes of waiting to finally get my pizzas, and the manager (owner?) calls me over. Goes through the motions to show me my pizzas to make sure they are correct. They were correct except for one pizza was a different customers. No big deal, they had the correct pizza done already just need to switch it out.   WRONG! The manager thought it was a big deal! He begins scolding a male employee in front of me. \"You guys suck, like seriously watch these pizzas better!\"   I'm all for coaching your employees, but.... probably should coach the right employee (that employee didn't prep my order!) and two, probably shouldn't be such a jerk? about it.   3 stars for the food 2 for the whack customer service.  Replace your manager or whatever the heck that man was. I'm positive the customer service is lacking, because of his leadership skills."}
{"text":"DIY pizza spots are a food trend only second to the sushirrito/poke bowls, but PizzaRev stands out in a few ways.  #1 They have beer and wine. Who doesn't love the classic combination of pizza and beer?! Plus they actually have a bar area with a couple of TVs to watch a game. This chain skews toward a slightly older crowd than the other family-centric chains.  #2 Their service is hella friendly. Like, Brandon and I could legit be friends. It's not just greeting everyone and smiling, the staff along the assembly line make genuine conversation.   #3 They have constant promos and discounts! Mondays 4 can dine for $40, including pizzas, salad, drinks, and dessert. Tuesdays, their usual $8 pies are $6. Downloading their RevRewards app gets you an instant freebie. It's like they actually want you to come back!  #4 Their product is pretty good. You can double up on crusts for a thicker hand-tossed version, or pay $2 more for GF. They aren't stingy with the toppings. Vegan options (daiya) and seasonal specials (roasted brussels sprouts!) are available. Food comes out fairly fast and it's more than enough for one meal.   As long as PizzaRev's around, I'll be coming back every couple of weeks. But I wouldn't complain if they made a location about five miles north..."}
{"text":"1st time here. Nice space with lots of tables, counters and small patio with a view of the mountains. Ordering is quick and there are lots of choices. There was some confusion when I ordered the fennel sausage pizza because I opted for the red sauce instead of just olive oil. They started leaving off the ingredients from the fennel sausage pizza since I changed the sauce. I just wanted red sauce but still wanted everything that comes on the fennel sausage pizza. They even put the wrong cheese (fennel pizza is supposed to have ricotta not mozzarella). I guess I just need to be more clear, but it's my 1st time here.   Dough was thin and crispy, but the ingredients were sparse and not as nicely art directed as a Blaze pizza or Pieology. Those places seem to put more care in the assembly of your custom pizza.   Service was quick and friendly.   Overall feeling - I want to come back and try more but I wasn't wowed by the place."}
{"text":"The service here is the best for a joint like this!!! Nothing like being able to make your own pie for $7.99!!! I am a little bashful of saying this, but it is my 5th day in a row it is that good! They make the experience amazing and it has to be the best pizza I have had! Thanks Rev team!!"}
{"text":"Mmm, Pizza Rev. They have delicious pizza AND Carlos gave me my own apple juice swag. (Ask for, Carlos El Jefe about that.) He'll hook you up and make sure that your experience is a great one!"}
{"text":"Came in a Friday for lunch around 12pm & place was packed. Writing this review as I wait to be able to order. Standing in line for an hr now. I should have left but my co-workers wanted to try it. If this is how long it takes I won't be back again. I've been to Blaze Pizza several times @ peak times & they have the system down & get you moved through the line fast. Based on service time alone it gets a 1 star. Haven't even tried the pizza yet. It took up. All of my lunch hr then some. :-(  Update after trying pizza...not really impressed. Super skimpy on toppings. I ordered sausage & fennel pizza & added mushrooms & basically there was 1 piece of sausage & mushroom on each piece. Very disappointed. Sticking with Blaze."}
{"text":"Our family thoroughly enjoys this place. It is like the Zabas of Pizza. You create your own pizza as you move down the assembly line. The toppings are high quality and what make it good. The dough and marinara sauce could be better, but overall they are still delicious. Go on Tuesdays when they have their $6 pizza deal. My favorite pie so far is the sausage and fennel. I add meatballs to it. It gets busy and there isn't too much seating available, especially for large families, so try to go before 6 or after 7:30 to avoid the crowd.  Be creative because their specialty pie menu is limited. If you are looking for more than pizza, this is not your place, but they do have salads."}
{"text":"It's alright if you like thin crust pizza. I'd recommend going elsewhere if you're not a thin crust fan.   Pros - Clean atmosphere and friendly staff when we went on a busy Thursday evening. They had quick service and our food didn't take long to get either. Their pizza and salads are inexpensive as well.  Cons - My salad was wilted and not crisp. The lettuce certainly wasn't brown, but it just tasted like it had been at a warm temperature for awhile and limp......     Sorry :( I ended up throwing it out and eating just the pizza. My kids ordered a pepperoni pizza and then we ordered another pizza to take home with various meat and veggies for my husband. Neither pizza was anything to brag about. While the pizza isn't terrible --- it's just not that good either. The crust is thin, and there's not a lot of sauce and cheese. Toppings are sparingly applied to the pizzas too."}
{"text":"Such a great place for personal pizza! Beats Pieology 100%. Service is great and quick and the pizza is amazing. I really appreciate the vegan cheese option too!"}
{"text":"Go to pizza rev on Tuesdays! All pizzas are $6 all day long. But expect to stand in line during peak times. Anyways, so worth it! Brandon the manager is a trip. He is so in love with his job and it makes his customer's day. Great value, fresh ingredients, and to top it off...You get to customize you very own pizza that will spark your taste buds. And if you don't like your customized pizza, remember, you created it. Take your family and friends on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"The concept is a fun way to enjoy pizza. Who doesn't like to get it their way!!! We were a bit leery  because some of the reviews were not that great but we decided to give it a try. Our pizza tasted fresh. Was prepared with care. ( not all lumped on and messy). Fast friendly service. We did not enjoy the dessert pizza. It was a little rubbery. Overall we enjoyed our custom created pizza. We would return again to try other combinations."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere clean quick fast healthy. I love that you're able to order your own personal pizza and put on whatever you like but the same price and you have great wine and beer specials"}
{"text":"I love this pizza concept!  Instead of everyone in the family fighting over toppings - everyone gets their own pizza! This makes taking the family out to pizza - soooo much easier.   They have so many choices. We love it here!"}
{"text":"My family and I had a delightful lunch here.  Tuesday they have a special. I love this make your own pizza concept as a mom I'm always stuck eating what my family wants when we have pizza. It was awesome to get exactly what I wanted! And the staff is friendly and helpful.  Def coming back."}
{"text":"This place is no bueno. Go to Blaze if you want to build your own pizza! The crust is super ridiculously thin and they are stingy with the cheese even when you are paying for unlimited toppings. The girl working there actually said if I give you too much cheese I will get in trouble."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The staff is always outgoing and friendly.  Food is always fresh. Sometimes a little bit of a wait (on busy nights) but overall I've never had a problem at this location."}
{"text":"Pizza: even when it's bad, it's good. I mean, it's pizza. Carb base plus sauce plus toppings, which you can mix and match willy-nilly. What's not to love?!  Well, my inner Hulk comes out when they are out of roasted garlic but that's another story.  Pizza Rev is perfect when you're dining solo but craving pizza and have no self-control or when your dining companion has incompatible pizza preferences. The size is just a bit more than a single meal and they have all sorts of customization options. I tend to stick to spicy sauce and spicy pepperoni, mix mozz and feta, then shake up the veggies and drizzle on some pesto every now and then.   This particular location stands out in two additional ways: their taproom area (self-serve beers and wines) and their staff (extraordinarily friendly). I've quickly become a regular since they opened and don't see that changing any time soon. Download the app to rack up discount points and the occasional BOGO offer."}
{"text":"Love this place.They do a great job with protecting your food if you have a gluten allergy. I like my crust crispy and my crust was just that, on my white sauce,self build pizza. I only wish I can get more pizza for what they charge, It's pretty small. Overall, Really good food, really dope  spot to bring your family or just have a fun date night."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty tasty. I love the idea of building my own pizza but I guess every pizza place technically allows you to. I wish they were bigger. The one pizza leaves me hungry after. But still a great place for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"I am very unhappy with my last visit here. I've been here so many times I can even count. Pizza is good and I never have an issue here. I order my pizza the same exact way every single time. I'm one of those people who like to do things one at a time. If I want more than one meat I'm gonna tell you one at a time after I have what I want of the first meat. So today I ordered my pizza and got to the meat section. She wants to know every kind of meat I want right then and there. And I told her oh no, I'm sorry I work better one by one please. So I tell her I want ham. She puts 4 little pieces of ham on my pizza... I ask for more and she puts 2 more...  And I ask for more again and she puts 1 more... Annoyed I ask for more and she said well I need to know what else you want.  I told her I wanted more ham...  But apparently there is a max on ham? Needless to say I stilll did not have the normal amount of ham and Pineapple I like on my pizza. Once again I never have had an issue like this before and of I want ham on my pizza put some dam ham on my pizza. Due to this I will not come here anymore. I will go to the competition across the street. Don't call a pizza build tour own if your not going to let me have what I want on my pizza. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Same concept as Pieology and Pizza Blaze except this one didn't impress me & hubby. Ordering is easy, but they are very skimpy on toppings. Also the crust is bland. Ordered a side salad [ dressing was terrible]  & soda.   Tables were dirty.  Def returning to Blaze pizza, not here. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Thee best pizza ever and the gluten free is amazing.  Restaurant is always clean and the staff are very friendly.  Im addicted to this place.   They even have $6 pizza on Tuesdays"}
{"text":"Tried this place out a couple times, I felt the whole pizza experience was just alright . The build-your-own concept is quite a trend lately with pizza joints poppin up all over the valley. So we were happy to see one in this area.   For the record: the first visit was the days before their grand opening and my pizza was complimentary for visitors during that day only. Second, and subsequent visits were a week after their grand opening.  --the Za I didn't care for the dough they use. Bland, texture real dry and well frankly reminded me of cheap frozen pizza crust. Not enough selection of veggie toppings for me.  And unless you ask for more of one topping, they kind of skimp on servings of each topping.. Not their fault though. You are in control of building your pizza, so just ask!  Disappointed in the artisanal cheeses offered.  No fresh mozz?  Only shredded.  No goat cheese.. boo.   The sauces were just ok as well. Prices under ten bucks are in ballpark with other places, but portion size is smaller.  Nothing stood out to differentiate themselves from their competitors other than they are the only fast /casual byo in the area, but that is about to change.   Service was friendly, the dining area is small but there are additional tables outdoors.  This place is perfect for employees working in the area to a grab a quick decent lunch."}
{"text":"If I must say so, I enjoyed the pizza. It was very tasty and trendy. I found it easy to order. The only down side is that the staff person that waited on me was inexperienced and I had to repeat my order multiple times."}
{"text":"Nothing really came together for me.  Love the concept of building your own pizza and I'm a fan of the other two businesses in town who do the same thing.   I chose half a margarita & the other half BBQ chicken. Wanted to add ricotta to the margarita side but they were out. Ricotta is sold & available everywhere... The tomatoes were diced finely and it looked like my pizza had salsa on it. This also made my pizza wet and I HATE wet pizza. Why can't they simply cut a baby tomato in half & call it a day? On to the BBQ chicken pizza, the chicken didn't taste like anything, completely bland with zero seasoning. They forgot to add red onions to it as well which I should have caught as they were making it but it was an item that was supposed to come on that particular pizza.   The pizzas are super thin which I love but mine was unfortunately soggy from the diced tomatoes. I also like that they cook in about 3-4 minutes. I may give it one more shot and try something else but first impressions are a big deal to me and this one wasn't a good one."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing and one of the guy who was working by the name of Brandon really brought the enthusiasm out and made the customers feel welcome! Def coming back  amazing service !!"}
{"text":"Would have given this place no stars. Took my boys here for the first time and we where all really excited to try this place for the first time. The price is good but the size of the pizza and the flavor of the pizza is a joke. Pizza was over cooked and the employees making the pizzas lacked   creativity. I .......I mean my family will never return again. Should of went to Blaze Pizza like we wanted to!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been in here several times.  Each time I am here Isaiah has met us with a smile.  He is always happy and willing to make sure our pizzas are correct.   Employees like him are hard to find.   Oh, and the pizzas aren't bad either."}
{"text":"It's a modern take on the traditional way of ordering pizza. This place is a fusion of Domino's meets Sunway. I love the concept since I love getting  unlimited toppings and the thin crust pizza. Additional option to get pink sauce (alfredo + marinara) a perfect cherry on top of this package. My favorite is Thin crust w/ pink sauce mushroom onions fennel sausage and meatballs. I always ask them to make is well done. On Tuesdays all pizzas are $6. You should definitely check this place put at least once."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!!!! Octavio was very kind and helpful. Everyone had a positive attitude, greeted us in and out, and the pizza was phenomenal. I would highly recommend anyone to come here!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming to this location. You always feel welcomed as soon as you walk in and the staff are always friendly. It is always clean and the options to choose from are stocked and fresh. Every time we go, Thomas consistently has a positive attitude and vibe. Although, I don't know the rest of the staffs names, they all have been just as great! If you're looking for a quick bite with a great atmosphere then this is your place."}
{"text":"Build your own pizza? Yes please!!! I've been here twice in one week and can polish off my own pizza. They have a good selection of toppings and not just your average ones either. And do not skimp at all! The crust is thin and crispy. Service is awesome, we love coming here and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I recently ate at Pizza Rev with my best friend. I'll be honest, it was okay. Some of the staff were funny and nice but I didn't really enjoy my pizza. My friend did have a problem where the employ who was making her pizza. He just placed her pizza in the oven without asking if she wanted anymore toppings. As a result, she had to ask him if he could remove her pizza from the oven and add some more toppings. It was minor but it was still an inconvenience. Pizza Rev didn't meet my expectations unfortunately"}
{"text":"I'm totally surprised by some of the reviews here - I stopped by with a friend a few days ago and was blown away, I've been looking for an alternative to the expensive, $8 per topping and soggy crust pizza places littered all over LV. I suspect that people who have grown up here don't know good pizza, and as LV locals just like to gripe and bitch about everything anyway......;-)  Having lived in Chicago most recently, I knew I would have to lower my standards where pizza is concerned. A lot. Not surprisingly, I've been mostly disappointed by the pizza I've had, so I've been making my own or buying frozen pizza, which is still better than a lot of the take out pizza here. I used to go to this little hole in the wall make your own pizza joint in Brookfield, WI as I used to travel there a lot. It was amazing. So when I saw PizzaRev I was totally stoked to try it. It was everything I was hoping it would be and more. First of all, Brandon(GM) and Co. were all about the good service and very friendly, explained their za program, etc. While not a wood-fired oven(as I'm a total pizza snob), they did bang out the pizzas cooked perfectly in just a few minutes. I like a very crispy crust and well done crust on the edges, even a little burnt is ok, which it wasn't. And my friend and I both got a really good size za, prob about a small at most pizza joints, covered with toppings and a drink for less than the price of a medium pizza at other places with maybe 2 or 3 toppings on it and with a much shorter wait.  They also have a good rewards app, after 1 visit I was already 20% of the way to a free pizza. And Tuesdays are $6 pizza. There's no downside here for me. I'm done with the crappy, over-priced and under-cooked local pizza places. I'll take the 15 minute drive, it's still quicker than the 25 to 30 minute wait I'll have to suffer through at the corner pizza place anyway. I'm all about the PizzaRev. If you're sick of the same old then this is the the right place to come."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Make your own pizza. Excellent service with smiles all around. My family and I  totally enjoyed this experience.  The staff there treated us like we were family. For the price and atmosphere you get more than your money's worth. The food is fresh and the service is personalized."}
{"text":"$6 pizza on Tuesdays.  As custom pizza places pop up throughout Las Vegas, I figured PizzaRev was worth a try. In comparison to Pieology, I believe that PizzaRev has some catching up to do. Value for food on Tuesdays is great but the overall flavor was lacking. Other reviews note that their crusts were very thin (I ordered the double dough crust and found it to be decent enough). I also picked up a dessert pizza (not for diabetics..given that it's covered in all the sweets)-- threw out half of it as it was way too charred (pc term for \"burned\") to eat.  Online order: process was easy and clearly outlined. Pick up at the register. Pizza was ready ahead of promised time but kept in warmer box until pick up.  Parking: Lot shared with several other restaurants makes for some dicey parking around lunch time."}
{"text":"Really great Pizza! Tuesday is $6.00 Pizza Day!! You can get all the toppings you want, on your pizza and it is still only $6.00! There suppose to be kind of a, one size personal pizza, but I was surprised, they were pretty big. I usually have a salad and pizza, so I would have a couple pieces and could easily share mine, or make it last 3 days, seriously! Anyway, the topping are great, Really fresh! They have options for people with food allergies, gluten free, organic, etc. They even have Dessert Pizza, I didn't try that, but how bad could an Oreo Pizza be? Definitely, check it out!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza in town. We live really close so go often. Its very cheap for what you get, especially on tuesdays when its $2 off. We like the fact that the pizza is big enough to fill you up, but not so big that it stuffs you too full. Get the cauliflower topping - SOO good!"}
{"text":"Got there and felt rushed and the people don't care about building a pizza.  They just though everything on the pizza and clumped it up.  I had to tell them to spread it out.  The pizza was just ok nothing great just ok."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza spot. Not only because you can customize your own pizza your way but the customer service never fails! They are always greeting us with a smile and making us feel comfortable. To top it off they have a variety of on tap beers!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this pizza place. Came here out of town, and the fast casual atmosphere was laid back and chill. We ordered online and got take out, and I was only bummed that the pizza wasn't a little bigger. The menu was great, and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend this, but just know that the pizza is pretty thin."}
{"text":"Love this spot!! First time we came here and being a Chicago Native I was very pleased with the tastiness and the Outstanding Staff!!! They're amazing, very friendly, and have a great attitude!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I was invincible today or not - but it took their staff about five minutes before even acknowledging I was even standing there.  Then - just to get a box for my leftover pizza - three people just stood there as if I didn't exists or another five minute wait. Just for a box! Horrible Horrible Service"}
{"text":"When they first opened I would have given them a 5  star but the last few times the bottom of the pizza was burnt and they got the pizzas mixed up they put my granddaughter's pizza on my plate my pizza on my wife's plate and my wife's pizza on a blank plate. The person ahead of us didn't get one of his pizzas. Not sure who was in charge but the person who was there when they opened wasn't. Looked like just a bunch of kids not giving a sh## what happened. When we got up to leave they were calling my wife's name saying her pizza was ready. But I hate anything that is burnt and I don't think that we will be back."}
{"text":"This is mine and my wife's first time coming here. So awesome that you get to make your own pizza make your own salad and they even have beer on tap by the ounce and you get to go pour your own and it keeps track with a little  wrist band. Gluten-free and vegan options! Super happy to a found this little gem!"}
{"text":"It was a very busy pi day so they were very busy and ran out of a few things.  I can't fault them for that I suppose.    The pizza was good.   It is a make your own place where you choose all the toppings.  They were very stingy with the toppings.  Everyone in line around me was having to say can I have a little more meat or veggies.   They literally gave me 5 pepperoni.    Overall good place.  Yes I will be back.  But for the price you can put a little more toppings on next time."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. It's definitely a game changer... build your own pizza, trust. Service is excellent as well. Shout out to Venessa, Carlos and Josh. You guys are awesome. Highly recommend eating here. 5*"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday? So yesterday!! Revolve yourself and create your master piece. Tuesday's pizzas are 6 bucks!!  PIZZA TUESDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh PizzaRev... I wanted to like you.  The concept is fantastic, the execution and the quality were just terrible.  I would have given you 1-Star but your staff was extremely friendly and had an excellent attitude, even though they could use some serious courses on efficiency and processing of customers.  First - there were 6 people in line ahead of us and it took 15 minutes for them to be processed through the line.  Second - after it finally got to be our turn, our \"prep person\" kept getting interrupted to do other tasks.  She was extremely friendly and had a great attitude and was fun to work with in line.  In fact, ALL of them were.   PizzaRev, you have a great staff... get your act together and give them the help they need to be efficient.  Third - the pizza is just BAD.  The red sauce has no flavor (the white needed extra garlic) and the ingredients were bland.  The sole exception was the sweet fennel sausage.  Now that had promise there just wasn't enough of it.   We had both the double dough and the single dough and both needed a bit more cooking as it was chewy and spongy.     The ingredient selection was fine, but I think they need to be a bit fresher to get more flavor.     If you are looking for cheap pizza, and the cheap taste to follow it, this is the place for you.  I don't think we are going to return as there are many other great places to eat pizza... but if you are looking to staff a restaurant... go check out this group.  They are awesome."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. They gave my pizza to the wrong person but they gave me a card for a free pizza and a free dessert pizza. They also remade my pizza and remember what was on it. I didn't have to repeat my order."}
{"text":"I appreciate any place with vegan options! Service was fast and very friendly. The pizza was really good too."}
{"text":"Raving about Pizza Rev. So many choices and so many great deals. Super cool atmosphere with great pizza and the thin crust is to die. Melissa was amazing as well as the entire staff. Got me some wine and a pizza how I like it aka unlimited toppings $9.99 I'm in love with this pizza place a must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, lots of variety.  Staff is really friendly, too!  Love that they have vegan options!"}
{"text":"Super satisfied with the option to have double dough!! I like my pizza fluffy! The sauce was good and chunky! And really good customer service! Hey slice up to the guy making pizzas on Saturday who was grooving.. dancing and singing lol! You are the real MVP! --"}
{"text":"Amazing! Walked right into the door and was immediately greeted by all the staff. The food was perfect and all the best toppings. Always love coming here!"}
{"text":"I have Celiac disease and the staff at this location were absolutely awesome at making my pizza. The manager was amazing too!! The taproom looks like an awesome new concept that my husband and I cannot wait to try."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever !! You could customize your own pizza. And the double dough pizza was enough for me and my husband. The employees are so polite. Greet you as you walk in, made us feel welcomed. Clean and nice place. Next thing to try will be the beer!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is really good!  Build your own pizza, and it's really quick as well.  I do recommend backing off from the ghost pepper sauce, it's just too much!  Stick with one of the habanero sauces, yo.  Solid lunch option!"}
{"text":"I'm huge on first impressions and Anthony nailed it! He was amazing he was very friendly and professional. He explained what pizza rev is about and the produce and meat I had to choose from. Then Brandon came for the kill.its as if the atmosphere here was caused by them. And the atmosphere is amazing. Will definitely be a regular here. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Pizza was made terribly sloppy to begin with! On top of that it was brunt! PIZZA KITCHEN is better by a long shot!!"}
{"text":"Want affordable and not so heavy pizza? This is the spot! Tried this place with some friends couple nights ago and I thought it was pretty good. The server was full of energy and they keep a good sense of humor. You can order salad as well if you are not in the mood for pizza. I built my own pizza using their thin crust, red sauce, cheddar cheese, pepperoni, Italian sausage, onion, bell peppers, jalapeños, and olives. The quality was really good and I loved how the thin crust didn't leave me super full. If you're a big eater you can finish one order to yourself. It was pretty cheap as I didn't pay anything over $10 for one. They also have different sauces you can put on your pizza. I wasn't too big on extra sauce. I feel like a lot of these build your own pizza places are popping up and if you're in the area give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I've been to several of the PizzaRev's in town and have to say this one has the friendliest staff.  They are fast and get like moving fast."}
{"text":"There are so many of this \"fast service\" pizza style restaurants popping up everywhere now and this one is a definite skip!   We tried two of their pre designed pizzas- white mushroom and margherita, both very disappointing. Pretty much the only thing actually cooked was the super thin dough, but all of the toppings were still raw and quite frankly barely even warmed. Onions were completely raw, as well as the mushrooms. Cherry tomatoes on a pizza only works if it cooks long enough to cook out the water content; instead the tomato water just oozed out on the pizza as they were also still almost raw.  There was way too much cheese that was barely melted through so you're left with globs of cheese stretching but not separating and pooling up on the crust unable to support its weight.   There's a reason pizza takes longer than 5 mins to cook, and this place will remind you of that fact."}
{"text":"I should have taken a photo of my food it looked bomb haha friend and I had a coupon here, super nice staff, poppin place. We shared the Mediterranean pizza with white sauce (parm and Alfredo mix), artichoke hearts, basil, and olives and added sundried tomatoes with a heaping amount of mozz. Would definitely eat here again and would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"We unknowingly stopped in 3 minutes before closing on the night of a holiday. We were welcomed by smiling faces and introduced to the menu. We took a pizza and two side salads to go. The food was phenomenal and the service was great! This was a wonderful first experience at Pizza Rev. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"BYOP is always the best way to go!  I really love this concept since I can add whatever topping I want to my pizza.  I get my pizza within 3-6 mins after ordering which is something I really love.  This is a great place to grab a quick lunch or for a quick take out.  I just wished the pizza wasn't too burnt and salty, but that won't keep me away."}
{"text":"Isaiah is the coolest. Super happy, friendly, and funny. Get your pizza, beer, and a good laugh here. Fresh toppings, lots of cheese, and a variety of choices for beer. Great price for good pizza. Thanks Isaiah for having such a wonderful personality and providing great customer service."}
{"text":"Custom made pizza with unlimited topping for $7.99 only. Great customer service and always warm atmosphere. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"So i think they were taking the lead from Pieology but they dont compare. First off they put very very little toppings on it and when you ask for a bit more they literally put on two more pieces of pepperoni and acted like it was a big deal.  The pizza itself was not as good tasting as well Too bad we had high hopes for it and its much closer than Summerlin but my bill was 19.96 for two smaller pizzas and one soda.  My heart belongs to Pieology  Heres an add on to yesterdays post a copy of my bill when i checked out and a copy of what they charged my card Now you can decide if you want to do business with them"}
{"text":"Update from two weeks ago They adjusted my receipt however i just cant understand why i had to write up a negative to begin with Im still not sold on them and dont know it they will get better"}
{"text":"Above and beyond service and friendliness the several times I've been. Nice selection little selection of wines and beers. Large open area for seating that is comfortable for families or the lone wolf that pops in for lunch. Was surprised by their big variety of hot sauces in the \"Rev It Up\" area.  They do offer a military discount."}
{"text":"The pizza was cruddy.. Super cheap tasting crust.. Generic \"red\" sauce might as well be ragu.. I regretted wasting my appetite on this place after the first bite.."}
{"text":"It was our first time coming in quick dinner. Brandon helped us with our order, he was very energetic and helpful. The pizza came out quick and the food was great! They also have the coke machine with all the different flavors!"}
{"text":"Brandon.. cool guy, nice guy, makes sure theres basil for your pizza.  Thumbs up , thumbs up,  thumbs up"}
{"text":"My son, Trevor, and I stopped in yesterday evening.  I really liked the concept of build your own pizza so was looking forward to it.  I like the variety of toppings and the mozzarella cheese was really good, but not a fan of the crust.  WAY thin and tasted like a saltine cracker to me.  My son, who is a big pizza fan liked the fact that he could have as much sauce as he wanted - a lot, thought it was just okay too.  The pizza sauce was a touch too sweet for me so everything was just okay.  I don't think we'll be going back, for what we paid there my son could get 2 $5 Little Caesars and I enjoy those more myself."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza joint in town! Every time I am here for work the staff is friendly,store is clean and food taste fresh and amazing. This last trip I got personalized service from there one of there managers \"Destiney\" who got me to start trying new things on there menu.  Keep up the great work guys see you soon"}
{"text":"PizzaRev is another fast-fired pizza spot where you can create a pizza to your liking. You choose the crust, sauce, and toppings, then when it's cooked head on over to the hot sauce bar and add some sauce to \"rev\" up your pie. I like that the pizza's come out fast here, but I do think they could use a minute more to crisp up the toppings.  The crust is always super crunchy which I love, but the toppings are barely cooked. They also are super skimp on toppings unless you ask for extra. The classic pizza I ordered had 5 pieces of pepperoni on it. I guess that is their recipe, but even Domino's will cover the whole pie with toppings.    I do like that they offer beer and wine here, and they have specials different days of the week. I am also a fan of their app, where you can earn rewards towards free food, and you can order ahead. This comes is handy when it's busy during the lunch rush. My only gripe about the app is there is no way to add double toppings unless you type it. This could easily get over looked so it would be better if there were a way to put how many of each topping you would like."}
{"text":"Being vegan, this used to be our favorite pizza spot to go to.   However,  the last 3 times we have went,  have been bad experiences.  Since we're vegan,  the only thing we get in our pizza is veggies.  The last 3 times we've been here, it's been a hassle to get extra veggies added on.  The last time we went,  we were told that they would have to charge us $1 extra per veggie that we wanted extra of.  We found this absolutely ridiculous,  but still decided to give them another chance today.  I wish I could say that this experience was better, but it wasn't.  I was told today that the person fixing my pizza would get in trouble if he gave me more veggies.  Then,  when they called our name to give us our pizza,  the lady handling the pizza was shaking the pizza around while calling another employees name.   I'm sad to say,  but we will not be back.  I'm giving 3 stars because our first experiences were great,  but they've gotten worse and worse each time we go."}
{"text":"First time here!  First thought: Chipotle style place, but for Pizza... Quality of ingredients are good. Quality of pizza making is poor. I feel if your job is to make pizza, you should know how to make it correctly! The staff just willy nilly placed the toppings on. Every slice of my pizza had different toppings, when every slice should be equal!!! The crust was cooked well, but the toppings were still cold....what!!!!?!  For the price we paid, it should be a stellar personal pizza! Definitely not REVolutionary. On a good note, BEER was great!"}
{"text":"Pizza Rev is my jam!! I've been to their location in LA a few times and I was excited they were opening a new location right by my house.   The idea of $7.99 for an unlimited topping pizza is amazing.   I always get the double dough, and almost everyone I know that's gone at least once will agree that their thin crust is just too cracker-like.   While I love to load my pizza up, my only warning is this, the more toppings you add, the less hot the entire topping base will be. Adding like 6+ toppings causes some of the toppings not to get as hot as the pizza. Just a little tip for those who go crazy their first time.   Also! They have a nice beer + pizza special for under $10 for those who want to wash it down with a cold one. Skip the soda, because they use that stupid new Coke machine that takes forever"}
{"text":"Best staff ever. Great service and really good food. Like the rewards program too. And the kids pizza is shaped like a heart! So sweet! Fast, easy and healthy option."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I had asked for a cup for water and was told that they were out of water cups. I asked if they had any cup I could use for water and was told no. The cashier then told the manager who in turn laughed and rolled her eyes. They then burned one of our pizzas and had to cook it again. It was still burnt and not very appealing to look at, but edible when they brought out the replacement pizza. This place has awful customer service and I do not plan on going back!  Save your money and time and go to Pieology or Pizza Kitchen for better pizza and way better customer service!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Pizza Rev rancho last Friday. We came to check out the free pizza with beer special as advertised. PizzaRev did not disapoint!  Dining room is laid out a little diffrent then the rainbow location. Maybe a lil smaller. They have a self seve beer wall. I enjoyed that and found it to be unique and fun. I had a Thi pizza the special posted. It tasted as good as it looked. I added garlic. My friend made his own pizza also came out really good. All the staff seemed to still be grasping what was going on. Its grand opening. I understand. Everyone was super friendly and nice made sure we got what we wanted on our pizza. It was a little choatic. We decided to try the beer wall. Great selection of beers!! We really enjoyed able baker saiason. The local selection was awesome and had a lot of beers we just wanted to try. Instead if drinking a whole beer. My only complaint about the beer wall is its not dialed in. It is new. While I was there though one customer vocalized exactly what I was thinking to the manger. I had two beers probably also a half beer in samples.  The beer is under a lot of pressure or my beers had not been poured in a minute. I work behind a bar I pour beer for a living fyi. My beer tab came to $19. That was a lil less then satisfactory. Like the gentleman before vocalized. Makes me feel like you pay for a good bit of the foam that comes out first. There should be an attendant or a delay. Its should also be noted that you are really only allowed two beers. So if you pour half a beer of foam sampling beers take that into consideration  you will have to walk up to the counter and talk to staff ( who I assume make sure your not drunk) to get another beer. Food was great , staff and manger was friendly and trying their hardest. Hope the beer process gets streamlined. Lil annoying to get a wrist band,  and have to re charge it / talk to staff. There also was no line for this procedure so your kinda intrupting check out and payment for guest who have no beer.   Friendly suggestion place a busser and the beer wall and reccomend they assume the sale of pouring. When no one is around they can clean. It would be nice if we could acess the cold glasses as customers without bothering staff.  Tables absolutely need numbers for orders and little sign that says still eating  or badges example sweet tomatoes. We had our table taken twice. Not a big deal you guys where slammed.   All the same we had a great experience and can not wait to come back."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple of times now and have enjoyed both experiences. You can build your own pizza, similar to a Subway style set up. They throw the pizza that you've designed into a very hot oven that cooks the pizza in the matter of a couple of minutes. No long waits. Delicious pizza. Reasonably priced. A great spot for some quick lunch-time pizza."}
{"text":"Joe, was very professional and gave wonderful customer service. This was my first time at Pizza Rev and made my experience wonderful. Everyone on the staff was delightful and friendly. I will be back again and definitely recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Custom make your personal pizza OR choose from a pre selected pizza for $7.99. It's just average. You can get unlimited toppings but many of their toppings were empty or close to empty. I saw some vegan and gluten free options. We got 2 thin crust pizzas and I felt that the crust was burnt a little, but I think that's their signature. Beer & wine is available, as well as salads and dessert pizzas. $6.00 pizzas on Tuesdays. Reminds me of BLAZE.......which I would have to say is better."}
{"text":"I have always been a bit weary the few times I have been here or places like this because I always assume the pizza won't compare to other places.  That being said, although this isn't my favorite pizza by a long shot, there is definitely a reason I keep coming back.  It is quick, friendly, clean, inventive, and relatively cheap, especially on Tuesdays ($6 pies).  Most of my trepidation comes from the fact that I think I will want to put too many toppings on my pizza and it will ruin it.  Yes, then why don't I get one of their recipes?  If I go that route I feel like I am missing out on the whole designer pizza experience.  Wow, just make a pizza!  So I usually try to find a balance of a ton of ingredients and just what I usually like and honestly, every pizza I have had from here is good and that is really a good thing.  I have made different pizzas every time I have come here and although different, each have been perfectly acceptable and quite tasty.   Now, I wish they were a bit bigger and had a slightly larger variety of toppings but I am happy with this place.  I also like that they have a wide variety of hot sauces that you can add to your pizza.  One complaint I do have is on their cesar salad.  It's just not that good to be honest and seemed like a waste of money.  Next time I will just get two pizzas lol."}
{"text":"The Goods 1. Pizza is average, conveniently located.  It was hard to say if there was a good understanding of the choices since the person greeting us didn't explain anything.  Just uttered something about traditional crust and barely looked in our general direction.  (See service) 2. Thinner crust, chewy, selections of toppings, similar to a lot of other \"pizza craft\" restaurants  Ambiance 1. Spacious, good amount of seating.  2. I like that this one (possibly others) has a Coca-Cola Freestyle to make various flavored drinks  Service 1. This is where the 2/5 stars comes in 2. From the initial greeting with the \"something -something\" crust offering to the end it was not great.  I had to ask twice/thrice since the person choosing the crust to get things started had a poor attitude.  Practically snipped words I could barely make out and looked annoyed when I wasn't able to catch the words to make sense of what she is saying.  No guidance on how to pick toppings.   3. At the cashier, I had to wait for a very long time as some guy never greeted me but passed by a multitude of times and never looked my way even though I was holding a credit card and clearly needed to pay.  Thought crossed my mind that perhaps this business prefers to just GIVE pizzas away. 4. There was a snafoo with an \"unidentified pizza\" floating around which involved almost all the staff and manager to figure out why one customer got the wrong pizza and one unclaimed pizza.  I have to reiterate it all starts with the initial encounter where a friendly employee NEEDS to politely ask for names and properly write it on the paper like they do at Blaze or Pieology.  And yet the entire business had to come to practically a halt due to the pizza mixup. 5. manager presented \"my\" pizza to me but questioned me along the lines of \"Isn't this your pizza\".  I am not sure why it so difficult to identify the pizzas here.  On top of that, he was not friendly, did not smile and treated me as if he was annoyed with me rather than concerned about customer service and experience. 6. One young female employee (did not catch name) came around and checked on us.  If it wasn't for her, I would say the service is terrible.    MoJo/JuJu 1. I am not sure I will go back here unless necessary.  Maybe it was a bad day or bad time.  I was always told poor management leads to poor staff.  Find another \"BYO-build your own pizza\" joint if you can there ARE others.  (been here twice btw and both times so-so)"}
{"text":"Stopped by PizzaRev for the first time and had a very pleasant experience. You can customize your own pizza and help yourself to a variety of beers on tap. A special thanks to Kiambi! He exuded such great customer service, very personable and friendly. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Frist timer loved it !!  kids loved it !! Price is right employees we're amazing the quality of Pizza  and the selections were great I give this place the two thumbs up especially for Pizza Lovers or a cozy fun place to take your family enough items to please everyone and the staff was amazing"}
{"text":"$6 pizzas on Tues!  My favorite for this type of build your own pizza has got to be Blaze, but Pizza Rev is not bad. You do get a choice of their regular thin crust (which they call single) or their thick crust (double) for the same price, where Blaze charges an extra $1 for their thick, but they don't have as many sauce or topping options as Blaze. I'd stay with the thin crust though; the thick tastes like a good supermarket frozen pizza, not a brick oven or wood fired pizza.  Their spicy sauce here is inconsistent. First try it was noticably spicy, second and third time no spice at all. They don't offer goat cheese, roasted red peppers, kalamata olives, pesto and a few other toppings that I love on my pizza, but bc of the $6 deal on Tues, we do still come here even though it's not on our part of town.  Be aware though, lots of people come on Tues esp during lunch, so expect a long line, and a tough time finding parking. This plaza is very busy, as with everything else on this side of town!   Pro tip: If parking is full, you can park on the street just behind Pizza Rev, or better yet, just go there first and skip all the nonsense in the parking lot altogether!"}
{"text":"Compare to Blaze Pizza their food is just okay.  Size of the pizza is smaller and with toppings they're very stingy.   They barely put any toppings.  With Blaze, I can have as much as I can for cheaper prize.  It also costs money to get ranch."}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely prefer it over the other create your own pizza shops like pieology or blaze. The staff is so friendly! The manager definitely did good at this one!   If you're looking for a bomb pizza place, this is your new favorite spot!!!"}
{"text":"Talk about the create your own pie market. Not that am complaining because competition is always good thing in the restaurant business. Once I saw they were building PizzaRev down the road from my house. I was excited too see where PizzaRev would stack up with Pieology, The Pizza Kitchen, and Blaze (honest that one have not tried yet). The concept is really nothing different in all of them. It all in the details that separates each one. PizzaRev somethings that prefer over the rest but if talking about the food just ok. The positive thing is they serve BEER. Who not a fan of beer and pizza??They even serve draft beer!!! Not huge selection on tap but they also have different bottle beers. Pieology not sure if they serve beer I know draft no way and The Pizza Kitchen that negative. The interior has more of adult vibe if there such thing maybe because serve alcohol. Or the fact seems louder then the rest. The fountain machine is way cool one of those multi drinks ones that push button. The service I found was excellent. It was busy went right at peak lunch time so had a wait. Nothing too long of wait for line that nearly went out the front door. They also sell cookies by the cashier when you pay. Wish had room for because some of them looked tasty.   The food I had regular dough (they do offer gluten free and double dough something they call it), tomato sauce, spicy pepperoni, sweet fennel sausage, jalapeño, and basil. The tomato sauce thought was pretty plain nothing stood out about it. The sweet fennel sausage that was winnah for sure!!! The toppings feel like the other places offer more of a selection choose from and when looking at the options not that look fresh fresh. The double double dough might be better then the regular. Try that theory out next visit.  Overall think PizzaRev is another great addition or option comes too create your own pie. Just if had choice would go to the other ones. If am in the area would stop by in minute get pizza fix in."}
{"text":"The staff was amazing since the moment we walked in. I wish I would of gotten the guys name that welcome us,He took his time and explained the concept to us. They have this really cool beer wall where you get to pour you're own draft. Can't go wrong with pizza and beer."}
{"text":"Went in for a vegan pizza. Came out satisfied! Gluten free crust, vegan cheese and vegan sausage! Mushrooms, red onion, green bell pepper, artichoke, Brussel sprouts, spinach, roasted garlic, fire roasted tomatoes...omg! Had a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Yum! They have beer and wine and I'm coming back! Thanks for making my lunch guys!!!"}
{"text":"We've had dinner here a couple of times now and we've been satisfied both times.  The decor and atmosphere is comfortable. We did notice that they could stand to wipe down their tables a bit more frequently, but it's not horrible.  The staff are very nice and friendly, although a little disorganized.   The main attraction of PizzaRev is the customization of your personal pizza. You can have any amount of any of their toppings you want on your pizza. Within reason, of course. And the variety of toppings is very good.  Their dough isn't the most \"pizza-ish\", but it does an adequate job of ferrying all of the myriad toppings you chose for your pizza masterpiece into your mouth hole."}
{"text":"Love Pizza Rev! My co- workers and I are always looking for a good but still quick place to get lunch and we found it at Pizza Rev. We have been to the S. Rainbow location several times and always on Tuesdays where you get pizza with all the toppings of your choice for 6.99. The pizza is always delicious and crispy, even if you order the double dough. The toppings are fresh and they have a wide variety which even includes capers. The line is usually long but moves fast. It is kind of like cafe rio or subway where you go down the line adding the items of your choice. The staff is always friendly and courteous. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because on two occasions they mixed up my pizza and gave it to someone else. They did go out of their way to make it right both times. Also the parking lot gets packed so I would suggest to come early or after 1 to beat the lunch rush. If you are looking for a fast and yummy lunch on a budget check it out."}
{"text":"Really good, super fresh ingredients! Would be great if you can also choose your own dough, like whole wheat for example."}
{"text":"2nd time here since they opened, first time I didnt like it cause it had too much cheese and the crust was sloppy cooked so i never came back, today I was craving pizza and decided to come back. The tall  greeter with the gold chains was cute and friendly, Having worked at Pieology before, that impressed me , The woman cooking with the braid cooked me pizza great and looks like she enjoys what she doing, Thomas could of used proportion and spread my toppings out a bit not piled in the middle ,"}
{"text":"So I heard about the vegan cheese and pizza toppings and of course I had to give it a try!  I love that you can put whatever you like on your pizza for the same price!!  The pizza was delicious, the SELF POUR beer was incredible and, the customer service was sincerely impressive!!! Thomas truly made it a fun experience with his warmth and knowledge!  Fun for the game, families, kids fundraisers, you name it! Can you really go wrong with pizza?!?!   Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I rarely complain, but the past 2 visits I made the employees did not have good hygiene and was a bit disgusting with the food. The cashier who handed me my cup had dirty nails and was scratching their face while ringing me up. The employees who handled the food was showing a customer the cheese over the glass, the cheese fell on the top of the glass, then decided to pick it up and throw the cheese back into the fresh cheese instead of disposing it. I wouldn't mind coming back because the food is good, but the employees just need to be more aware of cleanliness and their personal care."}
{"text":"I loved this place! My friend had told me about it by describing it as \"if Chipotle did pizza.\" The concept of a build-your-own personal pizza joint with a flat cost, regardless of toppings was intriguing enough to draw me in on one of my traditional Pizza Sundays. I got the \"double dough\" for my crust, and thought it worth mentioning that any crust you get there will be thin by most standards. The thin crust is cracker-thin and the double dough is like a traditional thin crust.   The staff was all extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. The only thing that partially let me down was the limited menu beyond pizza. The side salads were pretty good and I saw that they had a dessert pizza, but I'm hoping to see a little more beyond that in my future visits :)"}
{"text":"We were greeted by everyone when we walked in, but as we approached the line 3 guys just stared at us and waited for us to order. I asked how it all works, since we'd never been here before, and wasn't given any explanation. Still just stared at. Then my name was called 3 times to pick up our order, which still wasn't complete. The hostess did bring the final items over so I didn't have to get up a fourth time. The pizza was OK, prices are average, place looks nice, but I didn't see anyone the entire time come clean tables as people left. We were only third set of customers here at the time, so it wasn't even busy yet. Experience wasn't horrible, but nothing great."}
{"text":"My wife craved some pizza so we decided to come here after walking around Galleria Mall. What can I say...$7.99 for unlimited toppings and homemade dough? Can't beat that price.  Our favorite combo is spicy pepperoni and ham with spinach, tomatoes, bell peppers, and mushrooms in the red sauce on a thin crust. They also have $6 pizzas on Tuesday and dessert pizza as well. The place is very clean and there are also extra hot sauces available to put on your pizza. Tasty pizza at a great value..."}
{"text":"I don't want to give a low star rating because of my personal preference in pizza, so here goes.  I've been to Blaze Pizza before and absolutely love the place, so imagine my delight when I heard Pizza Rev was opening right around the corner from my neighborhood!  I missed opening weekend where they offered a free pizza if you LIKE their Facebook page, so that night, I had gone to Jimmy John a couple doors down. The workers there mentioned the crust is REALLY thin, but in my opinion, so was Blaze Pizza, so I wanted to see for myself. I used the online ordering system and my order went through just fine. Went to the store to pick it up and when I opened the box, I was a little disappointed. It was small.  Nothing like the size Blaze Pizza has, but optimistically, I went home and ate it. The flavors/ingredients were good, but they seemed to skimp on them. I created my own with white sauce, ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, tomatoes, pepperoni, and artichokes. There were barely any artichokes on it. I had seen pictures on Yelp with the edges of the crust slightly charred, which I do like, but my pizza was not like that at all. It was cooked, but missed that char.  The crust, well, as I said, I like a thicker crust that holds the toppings, not Chicago style by any means, just a tad thicker, or if you're gonna make a thin crust, please make it thicker than a flour tortilla. It reminded me of a smaller PT's bar pizza.  It was THAT thin.  Again, my personal preference so, to each's own.  Good concept especially for families that have picky eaters, but I probably won't be back :("}
{"text":"Still can't stand this place, gave it a few tries. Service sucks! I always get the same guy who messes up my food. I swear on purpose. Then when I say something they treat me like a bad guy. What's wrong with this place. Saw the ad on IG and told my bad experience. They said write an email in detail. I did, they didn't even respond with an apology. Whoever is in charge sucks! Place went from 4.5 stars to 3.5 stars real fast!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. We were so excited to come here because we love Blaze but don't have one on this side of town. To begin, the first person to help, Richard (I'm assuming a manager because of the collared shirt) asked me a question and didn't even listen to my answer. He was too busy panicking because the line got a little longer and was trying to keep his employees later. Why this was my problem, I don't know. I had to repeat myself twice because he wasn't paying attention. He pushes my food down to the next person, Kenny (also assumedly a manager, due to the collared shirt) who I had to repeat myself to several times as well because he was focused on the people walking in and talking to the employees around him to pay attention to the customer in front of him. My pizza looks like a mess as he throws the toppings all over the place. After he finishes my pizza, he goes to get a paprt towel to wipe his sweaty face... with his gloves still on! (Later we observe him wiping his nose with the edge of his glove-gross! And then pull up his pants with gloves and goes right back to putting toppings on pizza- that's just disgusting!) He then slides it down to the next person, didn't catch his name, but this one also socializing and ignoring me, I'm waiting for him to ask me what veggies I would like but he's doing everything else but helping me. Again, I'm repeating myself and I get moved along to the cashier who was perfectly fine and polite. We go to sit (at a dirty table, which I cleaned myself) and get called for our pizza shortly after. It's warm-ish. Not hot, yet a little burnt on one edge... ironic. The flavors are good. Love the spicy pepperoni and beef meatball crumble. Everything else is the same as Blaze and Pieology. A floor/bus person, Micah, checks on us, which is nice, but obviously hasn't been trained on how to clean. He wipes a table next to us with a napkin and flicks an olive off the table. All in all, the customer service was ridiculous. I work in the food industry and would never allow my employees to behave this way. If these guys are the managers, they are leading by a terrible example. We may come back in hopes that today was just a bad day, but I am just so disappointed. I would rather make the trip to go to Blaze in Henderson than come to this place down the street. Please tighten up your staff and customer service. Until then, I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere with a beer wall on tap, activated by a wrist band. The line has clear plexiglass to allow you to see prep and food quality. Incredible vegan options for cheese and vegan meat. Staff is happy to acomidate any requests for additional portions. Food is prepared quickly in a brick oven. The only thing that would make this better for a vegan patron is other vegan cheese options than Diaya cheese. Overall really cool place!"}
{"text":"Food is great and it's hard for me to give this place one star, but the management is racist. I've heard N bombs while in there from management some months back but I think the lady was relocated, she was Spanish ....either way that kind of behavior and language is unacceptable which sucks because the food is so good"}
{"text":"Thomas and Theo from start to finish did an excellent job love the deal thanks will be coming back"}
{"text":"This place is....... ok. Literally just that. It's the Chipotle, or Subway of pizza places. The main attraction though (and the main reason we wanted to check it out) was the tap room, which is pretty cool. You hand over your ID (they keep it) and you're given a wristband that you use to activate the taps, and then you pour your beer, or wine. Once you're done, you go up to the register and pay for what you drank (they charge by the ounce).  My only complaint about this is, they really didn't have much more than a large selection of hoppy beers, and I'm not a big fan of the pungent ones.   If you want a sub par pizza (my opinion) by all means, go check this place out. But if you're a pizza lover like us, and don't think that Domino's is the best pizza around, your only saving grace is the self serve taps I'm afraid. We won't be going back unfortunately."}
{"text":"I was not fond of the thin crust....definitely need a pan style pizza.  Not as enjoyable as I thought it would be for the price...definitely was still hungry after eating the whole pizza.  My opinion I think Blazed is better."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened in the the last month or so, last week they could not take cash and today only double dough crust available? They normally have all hot sauces available  for eat in orders, every week they get less and less today on four. Love the ghost pepper was unavailable? I think they changed managers??"}
{"text":"It was really good and really fast. Even my very picky kids liked it. The restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, people are amazing and the customer service is excellent!!!!! Employees made sure we were taken care of the whole time we were there! Love the beer on tap although i made the choice not to have any"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza spot by far ! My fiancé & I come here at least twice a week . Everyone here is so nice & welcoming . Never going back to any other pizza place!"}
{"text":"Me and some of my coworkers go to PizzaRev for their \"$6 any pizza special\" on Tuesdays.   FOOD:  3/5. -You choose either thin crust, or double crust dough (there's gluten free, too) and get to put whatever toppings you want.  They have a variety of red and white sauce.  And also olive oil.  They have around 30 toppings to choose from.  I think their dough is plain, and they should probably add something like garlic salt and/or more butter to their dough.  SERVICE:  3/5. -They skimp on pretty much every topping you ask for.  Even if you ask for double, it usually isn't as much as you want. -They're actually pretty fast, even during the lunch rush.  AMBIENCE: 3/5. -It's a medium sized joint.  Nothing special though.   I'll be coming back, but only on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"First time here. Our server Kiambi made us felt welcomed with his great personality and sense of humor. Pizza made to order to your liking and of course I put almost everything on mine, especially all the meats. My pizza was like a spicy meat lovers with veggies and I chose the thin crust. It was delicious!   They have the beer and wine , all you can drink, charged per ounce option that was quite different from any other place I have been.   Overall a very cool place and I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I think this is hands down such a clean , friendly , delicious place of business ! The staff is always so friendly u can tell they work so hard ! Melissa is a wonderful manager and so kind - I cannot wait for my kids and I to have more lunches and dinners here ! I'm a pizza customer for life !!! Business like this and hard working staff deserve this recognition !! Also their beer wall is amazing and menu options !"}
{"text":"These new style of assembly line pizza places sound good at first,  but they workers try to rush you through the line, they put a small amount of toppings & they cook the pizza so quick that the only thing that cooks is the crust,  the toppings are under cooked."}
{"text":"The food is always excellent.  Thomas went above and beyond to make my visit enjoyable.  Friendly and fun staff!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Pizza Rev! The general manager, Brandon, was very energetic and engaging. Not to mention, our pizza was super good;). Thank you Pizza Rev!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!!! Waited for 20 minutes from the time they promised with an online order! They didn't offer a discount or a free pizza!!! And pizza was not even done. Arugula was on served on a side in a plastic cup?! WHO ORDERS ARUGULA ON A SIDE WITH THEIR PIZZA!!!! ?????"}
{"text":"Great customer service and even better pizza. One of my favorite places for pizza. Ingredients are always super fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Used to be really good.  Now really skimpy on ingredients. All I get is ham and pineapple and have to keep asking to give .e more and they put two more pieces on it and I have to ask for more.  Pizza was over cooked and mostly tomato sauce."}
{"text":"tasty, everyone was really nice, yummy ingredients. I'd give it a five star but they made a lot of mistakes and had to keep redoing pizzas which held Jorge line. Not sure if there's a better process or what."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I get amazing customer service. Today was no different, Isaiah was awesome. I was distracted and focused on a very long day when I ordered and he drew out a smile and a focus on the present. Love this place and my healthy pizza was perfect, chock full of veggies."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to this location several times now, and every time they are welcoming. Love that they have an option of vegan cheese for non-dairy and vegan people. I was excited when they did the out door set up, as we're always out with our support dog. Today, being exhausted, we came for dinner with our dog and ate outside. My boyfriend ordered by himself while I waited outside. The pizzas were delicious, as always, but even more than usual! Made my night. So I want to thank everyone that worked there tonight: Aiden, Kiambi, Octavio, Marneya, Kiara, and Charlee! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Although the pizza was delicious my wife and I agree that the service, specifically, the enthusiasm of the staff was less than impressive. We will stick with Blaze across the street."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location several times and there is one guy in their line of people that deserves a shoutout: Isaiah. He is always pleasant and friendly and brings a smile to your face. I enjoy tasting different topping combinations. Plus, it's a quick stop so perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"They're still somewhat stingy with some of the toppings, but Isaiah is awesome and super friendly."}
{"text":"Two stars for cleanliness and because they make cute little heart pizzas for the kids.  We come here when the kids ask for it, but my hubs and I opt out and pick up food from neighboring restaurants. My kids enjoy it, that's fine. My personal gripes are the pizza crusts are way too thin and often served crunchy and I always feel like something is missing no matter how much toppings or additional flavors I add. It's just not the fast open-fire personal pizza spot for me.   Today, my daughter's kid size heart cheese pizza looked like it was just tomato sauce pizza with small cheese topping. Disappointed. I may have to deter my kids from here and drive the extra miles to Pieology or Blaze."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night around 7pm because on Tuesdays they have unlimited topping any kinda of pizza for 6$ (regularly $7.99). Was super busy and the restaurant was packed.  Kinda dirty and it seems like they were working on a couple kinks due to just opening because all the employees were wondering where the other employees were because they seemed short staffed. While we were paying for our pizza, I found it super unprofessional as the cashier was screaming across the line to the other employee about wanting to get a \"smoke break\" and they he was dying for a \"smoke break\".  :/ Details of the menu:  A) 3 types of dough: regular- thin crust, double dough (recommended)- their regular crust is super thin, and their vegan dough ( isn't dough already vegan??!?!?!: flour, water, yeast and salt)- must ask them what makes it Vegas because that worries me what's in their regular one unless they are putting butter into the dough which is unusual for pizza dough B) Sauces: Organic red sauce, white sauce/alfredo and some kinda green sauce- didnt ask whats in it C- Choose your cheese: Regular (buffallo and mozerella), blue cheese, ricotta, feta and I believe goat cheese and vegan cheese D) toppings: tons of meat options- 3 different kinds of pepperoni (regular-pro, spicy, and all beef), italian sausage, fennel sausage, meatballs, anchovies, ham, etc E) veggies- all sorts with sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, spinach, roasted and minced garlic, onions-white and red, artichoke hearts and many more  ***COOK time in oven is somewhere from 5-10min. NGL the pizza on the bottom and edges were burnt and it was really weird because I was watching the guy take the pizzas out and the spatula he was using (metal) was all crusted off at the end and already deteriorating- even he was weirded out by it because he spent a good 30 seconds just staring it.   The reason for the 3 star rating is because I am comparing this to BLAZE PIZZA. Idk if I was just underwhelmed by the whole concept because i had seen it before (subway or chipotle style line-make your own custom style). As i bit into my custom made for me pizza I just didnt get the same satisfaction as when I did with Blaze. Maybe because the dough wasnt as tasty and neither was their sauce. I hate to say but i prefer BLAZE PIZZA.  As for other specials they had it was great. They have a full service bar with wine and beer (dont believe they have liquor). I saw they had a special for 4 pizzas and 4 beers for 40$.   I believe we will be back because it it a couple blocks from my house. Have to give it another try when they get their service a little more in order."}
{"text":"I'm soo disappointed. This place is trying to be Blaze without 1% of the love.  One star, because they sell beer & I actually needed one to soften the blow of how God-awful the pizza is. It might be the worst pizza I've ever had, or at least Top 3. And I guess, one star tossed in for charity, because they offer vegan cheese.  Other than that, I do not ever wish to eat the pizza here. The crust is like a crappy pita that's been in a toaster oven too long. I've had better crackers. It makes a frozen pizza look gourmet. And WTF @ the size. It was barely a snack. The olives did not taste slightly fresh. The vegan sausage was flavorless. The sauce wasn't that great.  We left & had to go get food.  And these guys offer beer, but what they really mean is a selection worse than a college bar, or even Dottie's. It was like, Coors, Stella, a bottle of Dos Equis, and a few wine bottles with dust on them. Ya'all paid for a liquor license for THAT? I just don't get it..."}
{"text":"Do not eat here, they are cheap with their toppings. I asked for more smoked ham, they put two pieces on each time and I had to ask three times. The guy guy got irritated, turned to his manager and said she kept asking for more.  The manager told me the idea of unlimited is you can get multiple ingredients but not a lot of one. I said I've to keep asking because you gave me two pieces each time, just put it in oven (after I got fed up from a long day of working with no time to get food, am from out of town and going hypoglycemic).   The pizza came out with very black dusty bottoms which left black dust all over my lips. Their oven must have not been cleaned in a long time. Do they want to kill their customers with cancer from burnt particles and dust in the oven?  Do not ever come here. The worst pizza rev and build your own pizza place I've ever had and I've traveled all over the US. I've tried Blaze, Pieology and other Pizza Revs. Never a nightmare like this place.  Wanted to protect other customers from cancer with this info as a Healthcare professional."}
{"text":"Make your own pizza your own way! My wife and I love to go to this place every Tuesday when they have the special deal where any pizza is $6 flat. There are lots of options for meat and cheese vegetarian spicy mild even Thai chicken Pizza can be custom-made. The Coca-Cola Freestyle machine lets you choose from about 100 different soft drink so the combinations of great Pizza and great drinks are endless.  What brings this place down from a great five star rating is the cleanliness of the place in general I know places that have stainless steel all over usually know how to keep them clean but this place seems to be lazy when it comes to wiping down all that metal and glass. Maybe they need to adjust the ratio of Pizza builders to restaurant cleaners and take a little more Pride in keeping all of that stainless steel and glass clean and sparkling"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Got the gluten free and added a bunch of toppings. Staff was very polite and helpful as this was my first time coming here. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place, good pizza and great price. The guys are always very friendly when you walk in and they give great service. Today Theo was very efficient and friendly and went out of his way to help myself and the person in front of me. I am glad that his place opened in my neighborhood! If you haven't been there you are encouraged to try it!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that there's this pizza place around this area! And I've been eyeing this ever since it was starting to be built a couple months ago. If you really like your pizzas to have a lot of toppings, go for the craft your own!   Craft your own pizza: Red Sauce, extra cheese, italian sausage, chicken, pepperonis, onions, mushrooms, jalapeños, garlic, and spinach! Way too good, I like my pizza like this!   Everything is pretty good in here, workers were pretty nice! And yes, I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here as an alternative to our usual pizza spot across the street. I came here with an open mind, and as much as I wanted to like PizzaRev, my experience just wasn't the best. It's unfortunate seeing as to how it was my first time here!  Like most people, I went with the Craft Your Own option. I chose the Signature Thin crust and organic tomato sauce. I was surprised that the sauce was organic and even more surprised that the mozzarella cheese was made with buffalo milk. I'll admit I was a bit weirded out at first, but the cheese was ACTUALLY pretty tasty. I'll give 'em that!  As for toppings, I feel as if there wasn't a big variety to choose from. I wasn't even aware that they offered three different types of pepperoni because the employee making our pizzas failed to let us know. She was sort of rude and rushed us through the line even though there weren't much people behind us. This is what really killed my experience.  Our pizzas didn't take much longer after we finished \"crafting\" them. I immediately noticed the size difference in pizza when comparing it to Blaze. It is much smaller and way thinner. Thinner than I had expected. It didn't impress me much either. It was very dry and reminded me of those bland crackers from Dollar Tree that have been sitting on the shelf forever because nobody purchases them!  However, one thing I did like about PizzaRev is the array of hot sauces they offer. My favorite was the Garlic Habanero. It gave my pizza a little kick! I also thought it was cool how they offer different promos throughout the week like $6 pizzas on Tuesdays and any pizza and beer for $9.95 daily from 4-6 pm and after 8:30 pm... The \"Perfect Pair\" sounds like a good deal, which might be enough for me to return in the future. Maybe."}
{"text":"Another Build Your Own Pizza place.  They seem to be popping up right and left.  PizzaRev is about the same as the others to me.  Not much better or worse.  I feel like the crust here is a little too thin but they give me more toppings than the place across the street.  They do offer a double dough I have yet to try.  I've came in a few times on Rev Tuesdays when pizzas are only $6.  Pizza and a drink for under $10 is a great deal in my book."}
{"text":"Pizza rev is good but misses out on the selection of toppings its competitor Blaze Pizza offers."}
{"text":"Great pizza with amazing vegan options ! Neve feel missed out on!!! Consistent with quality which is sooo important!!! I have even ordered online and picked up  Always trust them to get it right!! Nice guys too !!"}
{"text":"Oooohhhhh this place is a dream come true for me! They have places where you create your own sandwiches, your own burritos and bowls and now pizza?! Perfect! Upon walking in, you're greeted by friendly staff and a large menu on the side of the wall.  There's 2 types of crust to pick from: thin and regular and then you can go crazy with your toppings like I did, or pick from the suggestion menus that they have! Regardless of how much topping you put on, it's the same price (that's why I went crazy!)   The crust was nice and crunchy and the pizza was cooked to perfection! I concluded that if I was eating by myself and wanted to create a speciality pizza, this would be a great place but if I was craving a simple pepperoni pizza, i could get it elsewhere. There were 6 slices to my pizza and I think because of the massive amount of toppings I put on it, I was only able to finish 2 and take the rest home.  All in all, I am coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Okay so I have to admit, from finding this place about 2 weeks ago, I ate here about 4 times . Needless to say, make sure to say \"easy on the cheese\" because boy does it make a difference!  It kind of made me want to vomit from all the cheese that was piled onto our pizzas (and I love cheese).  It kind of took away from the awesome veggies they use for toppings! So I took away one star because on my fourth time there, some pizza work went ham on the cheese and it.was.not.good"}
{"text":"The crust is seriously lacking here.. it was the same texture and thickness as a saltine cracker. The toppings were not spread out very well and there was not a lot of them. I'd rather go to blaze, where they are not so light handed on the toppings"}
{"text":"Planning on going to Grimaldi's but the yelp address put us here. Very odd. Reluctantly went in with my wife and 2 kids.   Dude putting on the toppings asked me what I wanted on the pizza and I told him I ordered the margarita. He looked at me confused and said it was his first day and had no idea what a margarita pizza was. Most of the toppings looked like they had been there for quite a while. Basil was dried out, etc...  They were very skimpy on the toppings. My daughters pizza had all the toppings in the middle for some reason and they got the double crust and thin crust pizzas mixed up. For around $8 per pizza it would take me $30 to get filled up here. The thin crust is like eating air.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the concept, the pizza was good and they had a great selection of beer too. Whether you're a local or just visiting Las Vegas, PizzaRev is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza fast. Choose yout toppings and get it in minutes. 40.00 family deal 4 puzza 4 salads one desert pizza and 4 drinks. Totally worth it. Friendly and efficient staff. Thank you do much for helping to fundraise for Joshua's Heart tonight."}
{"text":"Good pizza.   Online ordering never seems to work out right. Order is never ready at pickup time."}
{"text":"Isaiah was very warm and welcoming and helped kick off the tone of our dining experience. He was beyond helpful, as it was mine and my wife's first time. The food was awesome and definitely will come back to try the beers!"}
{"text":"I think PizzaRev is overhyped. I don't think it is truly that special.   I usually make my own pizza. Either a white pizza with chickens and artichokes or a Hawaiian pizza! They are quick to make and great service. But, something is lacking, and I'm not sure what it is. I'll keep coming back because it's a great option for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, superior service. Everyone that works there is super helpful and delightful. Love the tap room, you really get a bang for your buck. The only place I want to go for pizza and beer"}
{"text":"Shout out to the Thursday night crew! I don't remember their names but the manager is a Gemini :) this was our first time eating here and I am so pleased with the amazing customer service and the amazing food! I am so happy to have found a REAL pizza place with VEGAN cheese and VEGAN sausage options. I will definitely continue eating here when I get a pizza craving. My new favorite :)"}
{"text":"Super goood food! Very freshhhh!! I was very bummed though that I stood in line for about 15mins before finding out that they were out of gluten free dough. Definitely should have put a sign up over the menu that it was sold out. Other then that it was very delicious .."}
{"text":"I've been to Pizza Rev a few times now so it is time for a review!  Today's visit, I had the thin crust, pink sauce (red and white swirled together), mozzarella, ricotta, pepperoni, and pineapple. The pizza was baked quickly, I barely had time to visit the freestyle Coke machine for an orange/vanilla Coke when my name was called and my pizza was ready. I like the super thin crust and I personally like when it gets dark and a little burnt. Today's pizza came out exactly like that. Staff member Kenny is super friendly. I think I made his day today by giving him my black Sharpie marker so he could write guest names on the parchment paper. (He was struggling with a pen so I offered my Sharpie, told him to keep it) I think the prices are very reasonable and the pizza is delicious! Service is quick, even with a dozen people in line. The restaurant is clean, music is not too loud, lots of windows to let in light and lots of available seating. There is a liquor license so one can purchase alcohol but I don't drink so I am not sure what specific alcoholic drinks they sell. I will continue to visit Pizza Rev, especially now with pink sauce on my pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!! Can't believe it's taken so long for this concept to happen! Everything from the dough to the plethora of toppings was amazing.."}
{"text":"I loved the location in Minnesota, but this one not only had fewer topping choices and were stingy with the ones they offered, but the toppings had at least 2 pebble like things in the garlic or the olives. I thought the first one was a fluke, but the second one I BROKE my tooth on! It fractured bad enough the dentist tells me I will have 3 grand in repair bills when the implant is done, so definitely the most expensive meal I've eaten."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to Pizza Rev, and I have to say, it did not disappoint! I ordered the Mediterranean pizza, added bacon and it was delicious.   The customer service, which I am a stickler for, was spot on. No bad attitudes, or people working customer service that look miserable doing their jobs. No cause for complaints!   The facility was clean! And I guess I've been living under a rock, because they have RockBot, which is a modern version of a juke box. All you have to do is download the app and you can choose the music of your choice. It's a laid back environment and I will bring my family here again.   An added bonus, was the military discount!"}
{"text":"If this were my first experience it would be my last.  I have been here for lunch many times and it was great. This is my fist time here for dinner and I will not be back for dinner. 2 of 4 pizzas were burnt and they would not remake them without an argument.  7 other people got their pizzas before one of our group got theirs 15 minutes later. The worst is that there was never an apology."}
{"text":"Pizza is always good. Customer service is good as well. So many different combos you can make on your pizza. I've tried the anchovies they are good. Even if the line is long it always go by fast."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love the pizza here. I usually go to the rainbow location since it's right by my house. I went today since I'm 37 weeks pregnant and was craving it so badly, just to have to leave and drive to the rancho and Sahara location. Next time it would be extremely helpful if you let customers know as soon as they walk in or with some sort of signage at the door that you are out of chicken sausage spinach and ect and have no to go pizza boxes! They said that after a few minutes cool about the ingredients, but after waiting much longer, I'm told theirs no to go boxes and if I want a plate. How can I drive like that with a hot pizza? I was ordering food for myself and four other people. They were out of everything. I drove Super far after wasting my time there. Thanks! I hope this isn't something that happens often at lunch time! FYI Anyone  going at lunch."}
{"text":"I like the simple pricing and unlimited toppings, but the beer wall charges you for 5oz of foam on every beer and the crust isn't that great. Paid $12 for less than 1 whole beer."}
{"text":"This new pizza place opened in SW near Rainbow and Badura. Nice to see new business opening :-) I was so exited about it, went to have dinner one night and honestly its not \"bad\" but its not \"amazing\". You pick your dow, then the ingredients. I asked for some pepperoni, onions, olives & cheese. I had barely any ingredients on my pizza :( The manager was nice, place is spacious and nice but i was not impressed by their Built your Own Pizza at all Not sure i will come again."}
{"text":"Great concept for a pizza place, very much like a chipotle or cafe rio. Walk up and order your crust type (gluten free option is available!), sauces or olive oil, different cheeses, and a large selection of fresh veggie choices. I love the fennel and sausage pizza on gluten free crust, but also enjoy the Rev'd up and the classic! The servers are very patient and kind when it comes to allergies. They use new pans, gloves, and take extra precautions when it comes to a gluten allergy! Pizza Rev is definitely one of my favorite \"quick food\" options!"}
{"text":"There is a lot of debate whether PizzaRev or Pizza Rock is better. Personally PizzaRev has been a bit skimpy on the toppings as of recent, but it really is neck and neck. I recommend getting double dough as the original is quite thin."}
{"text":"The pizza Rev very kid friendly and helpful my family favorite so..we made in our favorite spot on Tuesday.. I love it here..they keep it friendly for kids"}
{"text":"I really love the concept of this place. The pizza was really disgusting though. It was a huge disappointment to say the least. The guy in the front of the work line making the dough ( which by the way was way too thin) he looked absolutely miserable. You can create your own or pick one from their menu. Same price no matter the toppings. Sounds great huh? Well when the pizza was done cooking, the veggies were still raw and it was just really gross. The dough was so thin that loading more than two toppings makes it really heavy on top of a thing dough. FAIL! It's a huge disappointment because like I said the concept is great and the look of the inside and outter building is visually appealing- but the food was gross.  I left this same exact review on Facebook and I had two people be extremely rude to me and talking smack to me personally( I don't know them). Everyone is entitled to their own opinion."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying PizzaRev. Not one who usually leaves a complaint I am one who does not go back, however, the pizzas taste amazing. If the pizza did not taste so good would have given a lower rating.   When we were shown our pizzas the employee even made a face on how they looked but did not say anything. 3 pizzas and 1 Oreo dessert totaling $30.00. Did not like the fact that the same parchment paper written with sharpie was placed in the box and the tops were not evenly spread."}
{"text":"Great stuff. Can't beat building your own pizza to your liking but the Beerwall is Simply Amazing and for a cheap price too."}
{"text":"Just recently went here for the first time tonight to have dinner with my best friend, and I'm loving the concept of \"build your own\" pizzas. I've been to other joints that also offer build your own pizzas and this is very similar. Choose your dough, sauce, cheese, meats, veggies. I like it :)  Upon entering I noticed chipotle style seating without the metal feeling, so pretty warm. We were welcomed as soon as we entered the line. The staff is definitely friendly, which I'm always looking out for since I work in customer service. Great service, good, and nice atmosphere.   Sorry in advance if you're a deep dish or thick crust lovers type person. This pizza is made a bit thinner than most pizzas which is not a bad thing. I guess it all depends on what you put on it that makes his pizza good. I was lucky enough to choose good ingredients, but I've read of reviews of pizza being bland. That's a you thing.  Love the personal pizzas, although you may be sharing depending on your appetite or how much you put on it! Have fun! I'll be back when I'm in a creative pizza mood."}
{"text":"I will begin by stating the positive not \"positives\" because there's only one. I'm kidding there's a few positives. I've been there often, in all honesty the service is good. When I go in the guys are always friendly and funny. The food usually comes out the way it's supposed to, well made and hot. I've only had one issue when I ordered five pizzas. I got them remade and it was fine but the service, this particular time was not so great. I sat and waited for the pizzas to be finished with a half assed apology and my time wasted. I value my time and of course I have to wait for the pizzas to be cooked which isn't bad, but they messed up not recompensating me for waiting for the remakes; seeing it was their mess up. Every other time has been good though which is why I give  four stars."}
{"text":"I went in to order 5 pizzas, it was 30 minutes before closing, there was a guy working there named Micah , when I told him that I want 5 pizzas it seemed like he got mad, he was just throwing ingredients in the middle of each 5 pizzas I ordered without spreading them and every time I was asking him to spread the ingredients but he wasn't paying attention to me, I go there so often and I have never seen anyone do that, he also was very rude which was very disappointing."}
{"text":"WHAT!!! VEGAN PIZZAS...I totally give this yummy establishment a two thumbs up,in service and the delicious pizza and salad is BOMB...this place is my go to as a vegan for Pizza...and also for meat lover as well...as a matter of fact I want some NOW!!!"}
{"text":"The concept is cool make your own pizza and it comes out within minutes. Add as much toppings as you want and POOF you have your own personal pizza.  OK... I'm just ok with it bc I've been to their competitors and I thought they would be different from pictures on FB which showed a line of draft beers... that was misleading. What kinda got me pissed was that I ordered a house salad and I asked for onions and the dude behind counter said rudely \"no I can't put onions, you want croutons\"  why the F can u not put onions? I asked .... rudely he states \"because I can't\".  Maybe he was having a bad day but no need to be like that. Anyway so service sucks and pizza was decent at best. What I did enjoy was the plethora of hot sauces. I always end my reviews with a saying... this time I'll pass on the saying"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of PizzaRev. No rush or pressure to build your pizza, The staff are very helpful in building your pie. I got two, one classic and one custom built(cheese/pep/sausage/meatball). The only way to go."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Some of the best pizza I have had in sometime...especially for the price. Staff is super nice and helpful... Eric was especially friendly to us when we were in there last night.  My team and I have been there 2x and will continue to go back. Great atmosphere, good food and awesome staff.  Glad to see vegan options as well as organic and local ingrediants.  Keep up the great work PizzaRev Henderson!"}
{"text":"PizzaRev is just 4 minutes from my house. I've been there about 5 times and here's my take on it: For $8.00, you can't get a better deal in Nevada!  It may take 3 times longer to make your pizza than to bake it but you get to pick anything and everything you want on it and there is NO EXTRA CHARGE! The crust is light and thin or you can try the new double thick crust. I prefer the original crust.  With all fresh ingredients and just about four minutes to bake your pizza, you need to check this place out!  Also, as of May 31st, every Tuesday, all pizzas are $6.00 each... Sweet Deal!"}
{"text":"I am in disbelief by the disorganization in this place. Employees were just standing around acting like they had no idea what was going on. When they did move it was at a sloth pace. They did not listen and asked the same questions over and over. There was an online order they were working on and while they prepared the salads they left 4 pizzas sitting out instead of putting them in the empty oven so it took about 40 minutes then they tried to give us the wrong pizzas and insisted they were ours because it was our name on the paper. No lids for the drinks and trash was all over the drink station. This was a comedy routine. 1st time coming here after wanting to try it for awhile .. at least we got a good laugh."}
{"text":"This pizza is your classic 3 minute pizza joint, but it should shine in this part of Henderson due to it's location near the Galleria mall.    It the same concept of Chipotle's, where you pick your toppings, and have your meal made before your eyes.  Being a new place, the staff is usually very friendly.  I have to admit, there was a few first day miscues on my visit, (giving the wrong pizza to the wrong person), but it didn't happen to me. i wasn't blown away from this pizza, because the crust was a little too paper thin for me; it was almost like a cracker at the ends, but in the middle of it did pretty well.  Perhaps it was because of the rather large crowds and they had to continue to make more dough, and was running low.   I have to give them a pass on the crust, and write that off as a first day thing.  I really liked the sauce (I'll tell them to put more on my next visit) and topping selections were very good.  Thinking about it' with more sauce toward the end of the crust, this might help prevent more cracker effect..  Well, it's just my thought. If you're in the area, you should give them try.  It's not a bad pizza at all."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't get the 3.5 star rating on this place. This place is literally right up the street from where I live and I've been meaning to try this place forever!  In fact, I've only tried these type of pizza places twice before and been wildly unimpressed both times. We tried Novicento on Eastern years back (it has since closed) and 800 Degrees in the SLS Casino. Meh on both.  This place is different though. At PizzaRev..  a) they were friendly b) they were not cheap as fuck with the toppings c) they had one of those awesome Coke machines with all the flavors (I fucking love those things!) d) they were not cheap as fuck with the toppings  Did I mention that they were not cheap as fuck with the toppings?? This was awesome and the result was a filling, tasty, and satisfying pie!   I simply added pineapple and grilled chicken to my pie while my friend added sausage, ham, pepperoni, and feta cheese to his. We were both impressed with both the fresh flavor of the toppings in addition to the generous amounts added.   Not only that, but unlimited toppings is just $7.99 a pie! Sweet! I can go for that!  I really like this place and I will DEFINITELY be back for more!  5 stars.  Fuck yea!"}
{"text":"This is our first time trying the pizza at PizzaRev and I have to say that I am so thrilled. When we walked in they all greeted us with a smile, when theybfouns out it was our first time here they explained everything to us. Having a food allergy I am usually afraid of trying new places because I feel like I make them work too hard by changing gloves and getting clean utensils as well as well as pulling other prepped ingredients that hasn't come in contact with my allergen. They were more than accommodating. Kat was fantastic and very reassuring that it was no issue. They wanted to keep me safe as well. The food was stellar. Decently priced for the quality..  We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Hmm. I had Vegan choices for my pizza and it was extremely good! I got Vegan sausage and there were out of Vegan cheese.... but was tasty with just sauce and tomatoes."}
{"text":"Were do I start!? Um ok with the happiest staff I have seen in a while. I'm Vegan and they were completely in the know of what to do. They asked if I wanted them to do a glove change... I said no. (Vegans are cray with this not me) I got olive oil and pizza sauce mixed. Omg awsome combo!!! Looked at the pics! My hubby is not vegan and his pizza was awsome too!!!!!! I'm so in love with this location!!! Gonna do the beer on tap next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Love the vegan options! Staff is always so friendly, Tazzie especially! When I am on this side of town this place is top choice for pizza."}
{"text":"Great service! Special shout out to Thomas for being so kind, and offering excellent customer service!! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"Build yo own pizza joint on Rainbow in between the 215 and Warm Springs. I think it's a great idea to let people pick and choose what they want to put on it and fire it up. I came in a couple weeks after opening. They seemed to have it pretty down. You walk up to the line and start with the type of dough. You can choose between thin, double, or gluten free. Next you pick the sauce. The choices include red, white, BBQ, or olive oil. After that you can pick your cheese, which include Italian, reduce fat Italian, feta, blue, ricotta, and vegan. After that you can pick your proteins and veggies. They have so many options I'm only going to list a few. They have sausage, pepperoni, spicy pepperoni, bacon, pineapple, sundried tomatoes, and basil. I really liked the idea of them building the pizza and throwing it in the oven. The beginning of the line was really nice and helpful. They helped me with my questions and kinda helped me decide what to get. Then end of the line wasn't so nice. I felt like I was being rushed to decided what to drink and not helped. I sat down and waited for them to call me for my pizza and I watched the line. I don't know if it was just me put it seemed like the staff didn't get along. I got my pizza and wished it was cooked a little bit longer. They have a free style coke machine which is always cool but I went with a beer. Overall a OK experience. I want to go back and try some different pizzas."}
{"text":"AWESOME STAFF! Come here 2-3times a week with the Work Crew we always come 3-8people deep and they always show love, and they get us in and out in under our allotted lunch time! I RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at this place and we will definately be coming back .. On Tuesdays its $6 and its delicious . We put all the toppings we liked and chose our sauce . Employees greated and explained to us the process .. Great customer service alllll around. Place has tvs , family environment"}
{"text":"Although the pizza is good, the order is usually wrong ( someone else's food ). One female worker preparing food does not have a hair net on  An employee was standing on a counter with street shoes."}
{"text":"I love pizza anytime. I even love cracker like crust which is what they have, oh yeah!  I just wish that the rest of the topping could be baked even more, before the cracker like dough gets burned. I also love all the different sauces they had. Chipotle was my choice thanks to the staff who recommended it. My husband and I had one each. He finished his and I had some to go and ate it later. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yummy vegan pizza! Relatively fast service. The size of the personal pizzas are great for a movie night or after a long day, and taste amazing."}
{"text":"I mean, being able to pick what you want on a pizza for 7.99 is pretty dope. But unless you're obsessed with all natural, organic or whatever the trendys like these days then by all means this is your place if you're willing to forfeit taste. It wasn't the worst I've had but it wasn't really anything to rave about. The topping choices weren't really that great and when the pizza cooked it bubbled up and spread most of my toppings either off of the pizza or to one side. The semi burnt bottom on the pizza turned out to be what turned me off most. It was hard to bite through and no one likes tasting burnt dough.   As for the service it was nice all aside from the blonde with the pony tail at the register. She seemed like she could not care less about her job or anyone she came into contact with. It's strange, her words were nice, but her tone, face and body language said otherwise. She didn't even look at me once through the entire interaction.   Overall I will just stick to the Pizza Kitchen on Ft Apache.  Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"The pizza was  the Food is  The \"Thursday night crew\" was dope af. They seemed to like their job and made you feel like they WANTED to help you. Really nice to see that especially in this city.   I'll be coming here a lot. I used to frequent pieology but it's so far away and this is better for sure."}
{"text":"PizzaRev's concept is like Blaze or Pieology, or comparable to chipotle but for pizza. You can choose one of their pizzas OR build your own. There was a promo for a BOGO pizza deal so my friend and I decided to check it out.   Parking lot isn't TOO bad, but it shares the same (small) lot with a bunch of other stores so it could get bad during lunch/dinner times. The line wasn't very long when we arrived BUT, it did take a while for our pizzas to be made. I think its because PizzaRev is fairly new, so they're still trying to work out a few kinks, or because they were training new workers? I felt that there wasn't a huge variety of topping choices as Blaze or Pieology, but I could very well be wrong. I do however, have a couple of suggestions....  - Cheese is good, and I'm a huge fan of it BUT, they gave us way too much cheese on our pizza. So much, that I took some of it off.  - Argulua should be put on at the end because if you put it on before the pizza goes into the oven, it will be wilted down to almost nothing.  - The cashier should remember that kids' meals comes with drinks. I was waiting for my pizza and heard two consecutive people remind the cashier about their kids' drinks.   I liked how they mixed and matched sauces, I saw people doing half white and half red sauce OR white and red mixed together. The people working were nice, and the guy that was working the pizza oven had such great energy. He was having fun while working, which made the environment fun. I also like that they have great prices, and pretty good deals. I remember seeing a pizza and a beer deal after a certain time for about $10. I liked their outdoor seating area and the layout of the place but I still think I prefer Blaze pizza."}
{"text":"They are very skimpy with their topping and cheese -- even when you asked for double. The Pizza's have no flavor. Pieology is much better."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent. Dough was perfect. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Also, love the fact that they use all natural ingredients."}
{"text":"Best experience I've ever had. The guy making my pizza was personable and friendly in the process making and down right hilarious. Not only that but the pizza was delicious,  a pesto sauce,  heck yes. It was my last night living in Vegas and I would regret not going."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here but my favorite topping is the customer service! These guys are always very nice and welcome you to the restaurant with a genuine smile on their face! Who doesn't love pizza and great service?  PS: they have a few options for easy ordering on their menu but you can pick each and every topping you want."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a quick bite or pizza night. They offer vegan Daiya cheese & vegan sausage . I give it a four star because we ordered online one time & they messed up our order they only gave us one out of two vegan pizzas (we order two vegan & two regular) & we waited 30 minutes after they said it was ready for pickup. The cashier said that they never received our order but that they'll get to it right away. Only for him to go after my husband to tell him that the pizzas were actually ready  but they weren't because they gave us two wrong pizzas."}
{"text":"Pretty good custom pizza place. I like the free double dough option for those that dont like cracker thin pizza crusts that are too crispy. Not the best pizza place of this style that I've had but not bad either."}
{"text":"Pizza inconsistent. Often burned, really flat, poorly made. Often fine.  This restaurant offers free pizza coupon for 5 star review,  so keep that in mind as you check out ratings."}
{"text":"I waited a few days for the opening rush to wind down and it was well worth it. They appear to be operating at full speed, the BBQ chicken pizza was delicious. I'll be going back in the evening next time to enjoy it with a cold beer!"}
{"text":"Brandon is hilarious! Make sure you try their dessert pizza, especially if you're an Oreo cookie fan! If I could rate this place higher than 5 stars, I would. Best pizza place, hands down!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I came in on opening day because I read on their site that they have gluten-free options.  So when you tell them you have a gluten allergy, they go an scrub down.  They then pull out a special tray and paper to make sure they don't contaminate it.  It was really awesome that they were this careful.  The gluten-free crust is rice based.  You walk down the line like at Subway or Chipotle and tell them what you want on the pizza.  A little bigger than most personal size pizzas.  Then at the end they put it in a huge oven and cook it.  The food was delicious.  I will definitely be going back regularly."}
{"text":"Gluten free dough was absolutely amazing plus the concept of unlimited toppings makes this place uniquely fantastic."}
{"text":"So, I ordered double dough with red sauce...guy put white sauce on thin crust (I figured it was thin after I got it cz I couldn't tell when it was just a dough) but, I wasn't gonna hold up the line and make a big deal about it so I didn't say anything and they were pretty friendly people too but, I hope they get it right next time!"}
{"text":"Pizza Rev has finally made its way from Cali to Vegas! This place is the best!! Make your own pie is as good as it gets. Organic ingredients, natural and fresh! The place was clean including the bathrooms. The service was kind, attentive and welcoming! Sometimes with so many choices people need a little patience...and the staff was pretty cool with those who needed time to make up their minds. This is a quality product so people who are use to eating  chemicals in their food may find this not so interesting because you can actually taste what you eat without drug inducement lol. After you get your pie, you can rev it up at the sauce bar. There are so many choices from mild to burn a hole in your booty hot! And of course, they have an automatic drink dispenser close by if your tongue has an emergency need. There are additional condiments and accoutrements  like parmesan cheese and oregano."}
{"text":"The pizzas are customizable, almost like a subway but for pizza. The white sauce with chicken and spinach is very good; sets it apart from a normal pizza with tomato sauce."}
{"text":"TL;DR: great \"build your own pizza\", affordable price  I'm not familiar with PizzaRev, but I'm happy it popped up on my radar. There are a lot of different \"build your own\" pizza restaurants nowadays, but this one has definitely surprised me. The staff at this location is really nice and if I were in the area, I'd come back again.  I ordered one Double Dough Craft Your Own Pizza with various toppings.  DOUBLE DOUGH PIZZA (4/5) - A good personal size for a great price - Crust wasn't burnt, which is a flaw of a lot of other places - Smaller variety of toppings than I expected - All ingredients tasted fresh and delicious  One reason why I liked this place so much was because it was so cheap! To spend less than $10 on a meal anywhere is a steal. If you've tried the likes of Pieology and Blaze, I would come check this place out. It definitely surprised and impressed me."}
{"text":"Great place for wood fired pizzas!! They were patient with my 6 year old while she was creating her pizza. Super friendly staff. Clean establishment.  Will definitely visit again!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Ordered a double crust cuz I like it thick. Had a cream sauce cuz my stomach was sour. Too much stress. Great atmosphere n big tvs, great cookies and the soda machine is new. Tasty treat for sure"}
{"text":"This place is yummy! You can even get double dough for no additional charge if you don't like the thin crust. You seriously can't beat $6 pizzas on Tuesdays! And you have to try the pesto on top after it's cooked...it a life changer!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed at the service I received here a few days ago.  The line wasn't super long by any means and they had quite a few people working, however, the person manning the register was also in charge of cooking the pizzas and he was running back and forth.  Needless to say, my pizza was burnt around the edges and way too soft in the center.   I also asked for only half my pizza to have spinach and artichokes but the guy put it on the entire pizza and realized only after the fact.  I really didn't want to wait for another pizza to be made after each mistake so took it as it was and continued to be disappointed, not that they offered to remake it anyhow.    This was my second time here and both times I have been disappointed so I will definitely not be returning, nor can I imagine myself recommending this place to anyone in the future."}
{"text":"First time and it was on a special Tuesday which was a plus! I decided to try both signatures thin and double dough with Vegan cheese and Vegan Sausage. They were very light with both the cheese and sausage so they'll get 3 stars but did pile on the rest of the veggie toppings. I heated up my leftovers today in a covered pan and it tasted better than fresh out of their oven! I'll give it another try especially with the special Tuesday deal and ask for extra cheese and sausage but til then..."}
{"text":"Pizza Rev always makes the best pizza! It's why we always keep coming back. The staff is always helpful and offers suggestions, when you can't quite make up your mind."}
{"text":"Good Pizza Make by your own with nice beer that so cool. Come too cook your pizza and enjoy to eating."}
{"text":"Just had such a bad experience after ordering online.    I ordered a gluten free pizza & added truffle oil for $2.00 additional.  The guy handed me the pizza, failed to tell me it didn't have truffle oil on it and I asked and he said no.  The cashier tried to give me cash and I said no I want it refunded on the card.  Then they didn't even apologize.  The manager went to argue with me and tell me I have to understand that they opened in May and are still working out the kinks.  Sir it's November.  You've been open for half a year.  He then hits a few buttons on his screen and says \"looks like I learned something new today\" after telling me there's no way to process a refund in the system, he processed a refund.    He went on to crumble up the paper and didn't apologize or show any genuine interest or sincerity.  I work in hospitality and food and beverage.  If you just opened a month ago this may cut it, not after a half of a year.    I won't be back and wouldn't recommend anyone to go here.  Pay a few extra dollars and dine at Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"I love this place. I came here on Tuesday because of their Tuesday deal of 6 dollars per pizza. It was pretty crowded, but they work very fast. Unfortunately for me, they messed up my order. They got it mixed up and gave me the wrong pizza. I realize that accidents happen, and they were apologetic and accommodating. They re made my pizza, and gave me a coupon for a free pizza on my next visit. I was not expecting it, but glad to see them go the extra mile to make their customers happy."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great, but the service and people are absolutely spectacular! If you want to grab a quick bite or a pint, or just want to come in  and chat with the Lead Manager, Thomas, then this is your best bet! Such a great staff, atmosphere, and great food and drink. Pass up Chick-fil-a and grab a slice at PizzaRev!"}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza is phenomenal and Brandon, the employee who assisted me with ordering both of the times I was here, is a great guy. Would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"It has multiple choices (toppings) for your pizza. They get done really fast. It tastes like heaven. There snickerdoodles are amazing. The servers are nice.  Reviewed by my 8-yr old, Gavyn."}
{"text":"We ordered from this place at work last week, and I must say we all enjoyed it.  I cannot comment on cleanliness or service because we called in the order and my boss picked it up.  But she wasn't gone more than 20 minutes and when the food got back to work, it was still piping hot.  The pizza is just how I like it.  It has a thin, crispy crust.  The sauce was the perfect amount and flavourful.   It had plenty of cheese on it as well.  Now, the only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five, is because there were only 8 slices of pepperoni on the entire pizza.  The pizza toppings are all one price and unlimited, which is nice, but I guess you have to tell them, if you want a lot on it.  Next time I will have to go in and see them make it, so I can request more pepperoni.  That is my only complaint though, because it tasted really good."}
{"text":"We went to the new location on rainbow.  While the service was a little slow (probably employees getting used to the process) the place was full.  $7.99 for your own personalized pizza was great.  Pizza was good and the decor good.  Service a little slow but I hope it will get better"}
{"text":"Omg I loved this place I got what I wanted on my pizza it was so good Micah was awesome and so helpful for being our first time got to try this place"}
{"text":"Came in too Pizza Rev Tuesday and was attended by Sierra. Her customer service is Awesome! Made both of our pizzas fast and on point. She made us feel comfortable and made eye contact as we choose our toppings. It must of been at the end of the day because she was on it making sure all her other tasks where done. While we sat to dine in ,she made a couple other pizzas, cleaned her work station /counters and cleaned both womens and mens bathrooms. We must of been there a total of 45min. Shes a great example of great customer service and trustworthy employee. Thank you Sierra!!! Freddy n Leah"}
{"text":"Great pizza....great experience. Thomas was friendly and helpful and greeted each and every person with enthusiasm as they entered the restaurant. LOVED the taps!! Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, loved the fennel sausage, and most employees were friendly. The cashier, being the last person to mark our experience, left a bit of service to be desired. If only he could have smiled, or said thank you, or acted as if he cared we were spending money that eventually becomes his wage. So close to a 5 star experience..."}
{"text":"Never been here and it is awesome. Employees are great and super willing to help explain and suggest dang good foodies!!! Totally coming back."}
{"text":"Not very happy! I ordered online and sent my employee to pick up. They forgot to give her my salad. When she brought it back and I called them the guy in the phone was rude. We drove 20 mins there to get the food and not have to drive all the way back for a salad that they messed up on. The guy in the phone was rude and wasn't willing to refund for their error. Not happy!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Price is great !!! All the toppings u want on your pizza for $7.99!!! Love it!!! Will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't want to create their own pizza for ONLY $7.99?  And, on Tuesdays it's even cheaper at $6! On top of it, I can barley eat half of this pizza, but then again I always eat small amounts. The place is clean, organized, everyone is friendly, tons of topping choices, and they are not cheap with those toppings!! I wanted to create an art... therefore, I added the white, instead of red sauce, grilled chicken, mushroom, bell pepper, pineapple and bacon. It was delicious! Give PizzaRev a try, don't be afraid to add weird topping combinations, and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"You know, I had such a great time I just had to leave a review. Everyone here's real great and it's always a real treat to come here. Plus, it's awesome to have genuine staff who will make conversation with you and don't say anything awkward like \"So where are you really from\" or \"Your last name sounds ethnic.\" Thank you for making my bacon mushroom alfredo artichoke basil with cilantro and cherry tomato thin crust pizza so good for my soul. Bonus: Order a Guinness. You might get a surprise like I did."}
{"text":"They didn't tell me until AFTER I started my order they didn't have basic ingredients. then when I complain you take 10% or $.80 off my order. I just watched you give the lady in front of me 50% off and a free drink plus free pizza ticket. You gave ppl waiting free drinks. Then my food was just OK! Besides paying basically full price for a THAI chicken pizza with crumbs of chicken (bc y'all ran out of that too) the sauce was thin more so like a dressing and saltier than a salt lick.  HORRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE. How are you mad at me bc YOU ran out of stuff?"}
{"text":"Well I usually like coming to this place but the manager who's working doesn't know how to talk to his employees and it kinda made me not even wanna eat here anymore. He was just being rude to his employees and you can tell that everyone is getting frustrated. I'm pretty sure the mangers name is Brandon but he really doesn't know how to talk to his employees and I literally left outta the restaurant with out my food because they were sticking their fingers in the pizza with no gloves on they do not how to treat their customers.  Update review:Brandon actually reached out to me and he offered me a pizza on the House I do greatly appreciate it I guess sometimes people are having bad days"}
{"text":"What's better than getting a pizza exactly the way you want it? This place is awesome, great fresh  quality and very inexpensive! Terrific place to go with family or a group of friends! Don't let the line scare you, it usually moves fast!"}
{"text":"First visit here and was surprised how busy inside. That tells you something. Ordered 3 pizzas each on their own design and they are delicious. I will be back"}
{"text":"So this place ROCKS. And has a rockstar staff. You walk in and they all scream, \"Welcome to PizzaRev!!!\" You immediately feel welcomed. The entire staff was so polite - especially Isaiah and Thomas, who both went above and beyond with kindness. For such a quick stop for (DELICIOUS) pizza - it left a lasting impression. Delicious. Kind People. Great Experience. Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"I'm basically on the same boat at Mel.  I was hoping that this place would compare to Pieology or even Blaze but they both exceed this place in terms of the taste.  The price, is reasonable. The pizza looked good during the line prep. Unfortunately, the pizza was horrible.  The bacon was so hard, I almost broke my teeth!  Staff wasn't as friendly as I would have expected- especially since they just opened. The chicken was also hard.    I won't return here. I'll be returning to Pieology where I've gone to several times already."}
{"text":"Once upon a time anchovy topped pizza was as popular as pepperoni is today. Hard to find a pizza place that carries them any more. PizzaRev has these little fishes and the pizza comes out delicious. Just regular crust, regular sauce, regular cheese topped with anchovies will take you back to your youth.   If you have never had one, try it on half of your next pizza. You just may like it!  Very good for an inexpensive lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I came to PizzaRev with my family a few weeks ago around 5:30PM there was no crowd at all till around 6 then the place was pretty packed. This was all of our first time coming here and it definitely wasn't a let down! The staff was so friendly! They greeted us right away and helped us figure out everything. There are many ingredients to choose from which were all very fresh looking unlike some places where the veggies look like they've been sitting out for a long time. I ordered the thick crust with regular sauce, sun dried tomatoes, banana peppers and some basil! Man was it good!!! We will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Walk into the clean environment and you'll be greeted warmly by the staff. Choose your crust, sauce and toppings and they'll put it in a real fire oven. Delicious!"}
{"text":"LET ME START WITH: you WONT  get the best greeting as you walk in this little pizza place!  The pizza is good but employees and even their sat night manager need better training and customer skills!!!  Came in with my fam on 10/14 night and place was almost empty , was our first time there so we are trying to figure out what we wanted and how this place Works! .........the girls kept looking at us as if why we don't hurry! And rushing us through the line and making remarks about it.....then I ask if they could sell me a side of meatballs and sauce and I got a look as if I was asking for something weird! Than brought the \"manager\" into it Who is kinda loud and hesitated so I proceed to explain my reason why I need them which I will try and explain here again since there as I tried to he cut me off in the middle of me trying to explain my especial needs 10yo daughter can't chew and I need to get her something since obviously she wouldn't be able to eat pizza.....but he could care less and all he could said Back is how am I gonna charge you for them?! As if I was asking for them to be given to me for free?!?! ......ummmm noooo!!' I said It doesn't matter! Whatever it is! Then they are given to me stone cold and almost raw?!! Really???!! Wow  I Couldn't believe it and I ask if he could heat them up for me, and again as if they hate when you ask for them to do something besides just putting ingredients on top of dough  .......there where about 14 of us you'll think they'll appreciate the business buying a lot and one of the girls is being rude to my sister claiming she had already given her. A side salad she kept waiting for and got there until we had almost finished with pizza and wouldn't want to give a dressing to go with it!!'  Seriously after spending all that money there you think we want to cheat you out of a side salad And dressing?!?!  Thanks for making our dinner uncomfortable!!!!'"}
{"text":"In the age of pizzadom and internetz, all pizza is good pizza...but not all are created equally. I'd rate PizzaRev like 3.5 stars. It's in a superb location and just the type of food joint missing near the Stephanie Street/Galleria mall shopping vicinity. Hendersonites, rejoice -- a craft your own pizza shop can be added to your repertoire.  Within the last couple years, these assembly-line, customized pizza places have ceremoniously sprouted around the Vegas Valley (think Project Pie, Pieology, Novecento, Blaze Fast Fire'd) I've had my share of visits to most of these, but came to one similar conclusion: it's just the novelty of the customizable, unlimited toppings that is really ever worth noting. In all honesty, I'd rather put in a Domino's phone order or grab a Costco 18 incher for a couple dollars more. The single thin crust option just doesn't do it for me and the flavor, though fresh, isn't distinct enough to have cravings for.  I attended PizzaRev's Grand Opening Party, which allowed customers to pay whatever they wanted for a pizza. (Suggested donation was $8, their regular price) All proceeds went to to support After-School All-Stars, which was cool. It was packed at lunch, but moved efficiently with their abundance of employees. My boyfriend opted for a Margherita pizza and the person helping him had to check what exactly went on it. I customized my own with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, olives, artichokes, and spinach. A few minutes later, we were served.   Side note: if parking is packed in front, park in the back near Cafe Zupas side and there's a convenient back entrance near the rest rooms."}
{"text":"Clean space, friendly efficient service, great pizza.... what more could you want? I had BBQ chicken on crispy thin crust! Thanks Guys!!! We will be back"}
{"text":"Well I'm thrilled to find pizza Rev and Taproom. It is a very pleasant surprise. Clean, efficient, friendly and great food and beverages. This place rocks because it's fresh and you always get what you want. If you don't it's your own fault. The ingredients are fresh and plentiful. Lots of craft beer options. Great for a  family or group options. This is my first visit and I can't find anything bad to say. Some might call it fast food, but I would say great food done fast and friendly. Its pizza, salads, drinks and desert. So not a Italian resturant. Great if you have different people with different piazza tastes. Each person chooses the pizza crust and what they want on it. Even a gluten free option. You have to try it to believe it!  This is going to be a new favorite."}
{"text":"Lacking the staff and efficiency that you would expect from this place. I've visited a few of these BYO pizza shops by a different name and see it done so much better at each of them. There were just a couple people in front but it took about 25 minutes to get to the front of the line. Not because the customers but because the 4 people working are going into the back of the kitchen frequently. By the time you're ready to pay, they didn't know what you had and asked you single or double crust and how many pizzas. It seems like there is a lot of room for error. Luckily, the pizza came out a short time after that. Because the cook time is still efficient, it's the staff and process to get in the oven that is not. Ps, the chair I'm sitting in is broken. Also I wish they had half boxes for to go.."}
{"text":"I loved this pizza and the fact you build your own. It's like the chipotle of pizza without the bacteria lol. It's taste even better the second day"}
{"text":"Super excited to find a Vegan Pizza place. Unfortunately, it fell short in a few key areas. First, the pans and pizza cutters are cross contaminated. There is no distinction between meat and no meat utensils or understanding by the majority of the staff unfortunately. There was one staff member that was very understanding and helpful on this matter. The only other matter is that our pizzas were to go. Smelled delicious!!!  Unfortunately when we got home to dig in, the crust was not completely cooked. Yuck. Had to put it back in the oven. So much for a quick pizza. Super bummer.   My note to the owner, please take the next step in the thought process and provide Vegan only utensils. It would be much appreciated."}
{"text":"Not only is the pizza delicious, but the employees are so nice and helpful!  Brandon was wonderful. I was on crutches and instead of standing and walking down the line to pick my toppings he let me sit and took my order so I wouldn't have crutch my way. So helpful!  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great quick pizza joint.. Very affordable-- $6 for a pizza every Tuesday! Some of the people are new and still learning so you get some dazed looks from workers at time lol! But overall, good price, good food, good service!"}
{"text":"Just recently discovered that they have pizzas for only $6 on Tuesdays!!! So guess what I did yesterday? I got myself a pizza!   I was craving pizza for a while so I decided to go here. If you haven't been to a PizzaRev yet, I would definitely stop by. It's basically like a subway, but for pizzas since you get to customize everything from the dough to your toppings. If you love the crust on your pizza (and carbs!) then you can choose double the dough without any extra costs. Then you can pick your sauce, cheese, meats, and veggies. The ingredients are pretty good and fresh for the most part.   The workers were really nice and even asked about my day! Another highlight was how they said bye to me as I was leaving the restaurant and they even remembered my name. Simple and small things like that definitely make a big difference and customers do notice things like that!"}
{"text":"Good fresh inexpensive pizzas.  Make it any way you want with as many toppings as you want.  Tuesday's pizzas are only $6.  You really can't beat the price for a quality pizza"}
{"text":"Disgusting..tastes like someone poured ketsup on  bread..if u like ketsup u will love it. Yuk! So not good pizza on any level."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Love the make your own pizza and salad options! My four year old daughter ate her entire kids cheese pizza!! That says a lot."}
{"text":"Tonight was great. Pizza was good and service was outstanding. The Coke freestyle machine was out of several flavors ( just sold out no biggie ) Brandon was a lifesaver!! He came out and fixed both flavors that were out and was nice and apologetic the whole time. We are used to Blaze being from New Orleans but this is a great substitute. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Go to Rainbow. Unless you just have to have a beer from a tap, this location needs to learn a lot from the other one. No greeting, employees do smile or gal with you as you order. Pizza wasn't prepared right, sauce didn't even cover the center of the dough. Mixed up names on our pizzas too. Took a minute to get that straight.  Drink machine sucks! Only limited choices and in a day and age of freestyle machines.  Disappointed. This place has a Chick-fil-A in its parking lot, they are never winning the hospitality war with them.  Never. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places in Las vegas,very good crust,sauce and toppings.."}
{"text":"This place is great! It was our first time here and all the employees were super nice and helpful. Pretty much all the pizzas are $7.99 and you can put whatever toppings you want. The charge more for the thicker dough or gluten free.   The kids pizza meal is a great deal. It comes out in a heart shape which is fun and they can choose cheese or pepperoni. It also comes with a drink and applesauce or Oreos. My two small kids split one pizza.   I ordered the thin crust, but if I were to go back I would try the \"double dough\" which is just a thicker curst. You can add whatever you want to the pizza.  Overall, the taste was great.   I also noticed they do fundraisers which is great if that is something you need for your organization."}
{"text":"Came for the first time and had the white mushroom pizza. Very tasty and I added bacon. Staff is friendly and Micah was a great addition. Nice and offered cookies with meals. Thanks pizza Rev!"}
{"text":"Ok...... My spectrum of Pizza places like this range from the Top ( Blaze ) to the bottom ( (  I'm sorry, Pizza Kitchen). Pizza Rev was a nice change. ( plus it's closer to my house than Blaze). Toppings were good and they had organic items. A real pizza oven cooked the items nicely. I just have a couple of points that you may want to consider.  1. People don't know to order the salad WITH the pizza. I ( and several others that I heard while I was eating) ordered it at the end when checking out. Not sure if you have a better way to streamline that. ( with that being said, the Caesar Salad  was very good, better than Blaze)  2. You shouldn't have 20 types of hot sauce on hand  and no salt at all in the entire restaurant. We asked everyone ( even the manager) and learned that there was absolutely no salt at all in the building. Get some good salt ( Himalayan or sea salt or kosher or whatever) and have that on hand for your guests, please. I literally drove to Farmer Boys to get salt and came back to eat my pizza.   Best of luck to you all. Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fast, tons of great beers on tap, and really nice, polite and hardworking staff. An extra shoutout to Thomas for going up and beyond for a terrified newbaked parent couple."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly, Pizza was better than expected, (I had the gluten free) give them a try, lots of toppings to choose from..."}
{"text":"Very good pizza; been here four or five times now. The second time was a little disappointing as my pizza was not thoroughly cooked, however I gave it a second chance and don't regret it.   The staff is aware of how to assist with gluten allergies. I'm happy they opened up down the street from my house!   Parking lot is always a bit hectic because of so many new places opening up in this shopping center."}
{"text":"Brandon,  Tazzie, Naya, and Anthony has some of the best customer service I have ever seen.    Very welcoming and efficient. .   As a manager and working in customer service,  I can tell from the good and the bad. .   Super happy to see a manager so engaged and leading,  not just managing.   And Brandon runs a tight ship, I've never been so excited to review an establishment.   Great work guys."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place around noon on a Saturday. It was relatively empty. The restaurant was impeccably clean. My pizza was pretty good, although they overdid it with the cheese. The staff was extremely friendly and checked in on us multiple times. It's also cheaper than similar restaurants. I would definitely return again."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but what was more important to me was how happy and cool the employees were. They were all funny, relaxed, happy and just talking to people and messing around in a professional way. That's what makes people come back and I respect that kind of stuff. Food might be 3 star ish but if the service is A1 the food is good enough, at least for me it is."}
{"text":"First time visiting PizzaRev on a $6 Tuesday. The Pizza was delicious. Highly recommend!! I got a double dough w/ Rev'd Up Meat & Peppers ... add purple onion & spicy pepperoni!! Amazing!!  Shoutout to Theo who gave my sister and I awesome service and made the experience great. He had such a positive attitude and a contagious smile on his face. Thanks Theo!!"}
{"text":"Their concept is pretty cool... You get to create your own pizza for $7.99 w/ unlimited toppings (they have pre-created ones as well). They gave out cards for free pizza during their grand opening, so of course I had to try it.  I got the craft your own pizza & chose: Double Dough, BBQ Sauce, Italian Cheese, Ricotta Cheese, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Crispy Bacon, Mushroom, & added Fresh Spinach after it was baked.  Although their pizza was good, I honestly wish I enjoyed it more.  I can't pin point what was wrong with it. The dough was soft, meats were good, they gave ample amount of each topping, and 1 pizza could definitely be shared between 2 people. But, there was something still missing... Like as if everything was a little bland for my taste buds. Nonetheless, it was good & I'm glad I got to try it.  The atmosphere is very chill & casual, and the employees were super nice & friendly. Like all new things, opening day can be a little rough. But despite the cons above, I'd still give them another chance & hopefully my pizza will have more flavor next time.  I initially wanted to give it 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4 stars for satisfying my hunger, and for its potential."}
{"text":"Best customer service I've seen in a long time, staff is is amazing, very helpful kind, patient, pizza is amazing!!!!! The best pizza in Vegas The beer is great I recommend this place to everyone if you want good pizza with great customer service."}
{"text":"The pizza was great and it definitely filled me up! But the service was not welcoming, yes they said welcome in the beginning but once you started to make your order they all had long faces and you could barely hear them, I said thank you many times and no response. They need to work on customer service."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and helpful. Great pizza! The place was very clean and they have a bar there as well if you want to dine in and have a beer. Go there right now and eat."}
{"text":"This was one of my fav pizza place by throughout the last months their service has gone downhill. Customer service is terrible and it's always dirty!"}
{"text":"Food was cold when it was handed to me because they couldn't figure out whose food was whose. Lady working there instead of apologizing just carried on like customer satisfaction was her last priority."}
{"text":"Love this place!! How best to explain it, it's like Chipotle where you can pick what toppings you want, from the sauce to the cheese to the multitude of toppings. I love the crust here! It's the perfect thing crust and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"The service here was phenomenal, everyone was friendly, we got our food fast and it was delicious. Multiple people came and checked in on us. Even took our trash when we were done. Customer service is a huge deal and they succeed"}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza snob but I do enjoy good pizza and this place is just average. Tried their Tuesday $6 pizza special  for dinner with the kids.  I think they could benefit if the initial person who asks you how many pizzas you're ordering also asks if you've been there before. If it's your first time, they should explain how you order.  Second, the dough sucks. Even with double dough, it was like eating a pizza on a tortilla. The vegetable toppings should be sliced thinner so that they can cook. Because the crust is so thin, the vegetables end up partial cooked, especially the mushrooms. The many variety of toppings is a plus."}
{"text":"This is the only pizza I eat now. No others compare!!  We love the pesto pizza with both sausages, spinach and capers! A little crispy..cooked to perfection. YUMMY!!! The employees are awesome-fun, friendly and always smiling! I've been coming since they opened. You'll love it! The place was packed today!!"}
{"text":"This pizza was good. I had a  custom BBQ chicken pizza and it was bomb.com. The sauce was just right not to sweet. Just right there customer service was great as well the cashier was friendly I think the name was Vanessa. Glad to have a new restaurant on this side of town. The tables was clean as well as the restrooms"}
{"text":"Really really enjoyed this place. Make your own pizza is an awesome concept. The deAl that is 10 dollars for a pizza and beer all day any day is out of this world. A must go if you are in the area"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pizza Restaurant ! Aside from delicious food and quality of pizza , They provides great service and a cheerful/pleasant atmosphere.   **Don't forget to pair your pizza with some wine/beer ! :)"}
{"text":"Love PizzaRev, but it's my first time coming to one in Nevada. Gotta say it didn't disappoint!! Staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. The manager, Destiny, was super kind, too. Definitely will be returning to this specific location."}
{"text":"When I went to PizzaRev  I was quit shocked. The pizzas were very good and the employees were respectful."}
{"text":"So the Pizza market is all out in competition and talk about BYO-Build Your Own Pizza concept in Vegas popping up all over the city. We have Pieology, Blaze and now PizzaRev. Originally we wanted to try Cracker Barrel for dinner but opt to have pizza instead because of the wait time. However I had this place bookmarked for awhile and decided to try this place out. We enjoyed the pizzas we ordered and the salad was descent compared to Pieology. I enjoy thin crust pizza and this was no exception, but you can double up on dough too. It was crispy and flavorful with every bite, our server loaded up on the toppings and made sure if it was ok for us. Most definitely will be back if I'm ever in the area with family or friends and needing a quick and affordable meal. You can't go wrong with a $7.99 pizza! Thanks to Allen M. For the recommendation!  FYI: -Gluten and Vegan items are available. -Organic and Non-GMO sauces. -Bottled Wine & Beer and draft on tap."}
{"text":"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! Have it your way...with pizza! Was so fun going through the line and selecting anything and all you wanted to go on your own pizza! And the guys behind the line made that first visit fun and inviting! Honestly, I don't know when I'll eat any other pizza!   If you live in the Southwest area...GO! Keep this place busy busy busy! Absolutely LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to see that they have Vegan options  Excellent customer service. The server loaded it with veggies. Much appreciated. Such a friendly staff. It's a place where I can hang out with my friends and family; everyone can enjoy a meal. I love the music and vibe the restaurant has. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I work here night crew member come visit. I guarantee the best pizza you'll ever try at a great price the customer service is just a plus"}
{"text":"Greeted immediately, friendly service from start to finish. I tried thin crust, 1/2 BBQ & 1/2 Mediterranean. It was really good! Great value-$7.99. I still like Blaze better (sorry) but it's way better than Pieology. I would totally come back. Tuesday's are $6 pizza day so even better deal!"}
{"text":"Way better than Blaze. Good size for decent price. They have their own root beer that's pretty good."}
{"text":"Host Kenneth, T1-81   Super surprised when I drove past the new Las Vegas location, so I stopped in for lunch today.  First of all, there was NO Bacon!  How in the world was there no bacon??  They told me their truck was late and they were not sure when they would have more. I now this may seem insignificant to some, but this is a little indulgence that I enjoy on my pizza EVERY-TIME I go to Pizza Rev.  So I reluctantly had my pizza built without bacon :( After a few minutes, I heard my name called, I jumped up to get my pizza, only it wasn't my pizza!  My pizza was not in the oven nor on the line or in the box they tried to hand me.  They gave MY handcrafted (no bacon) pizza to someone in front of me.  Since my lunch break was nearly over, I just asked for a refund.  The cashier first asked for my credit card to apply the refund to, then he called someone else over, because he didn't know how to give a refund.  The second person, also did not know how to issue a refund and just reprinted my original receipt.  They eventually, ended up just giving me cash back.  Never did anyone apologize for giving my food away, never did anyone seems even a little remorseful, just $8.64 in hand and that's it. No lunch.  No bacon.  No good.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"We celebrated my 7 year old son's birthday here last week.  The manager really made it special for him.  They brought out those amazing Oreo dessert pizzas and sang happy birthday to him.  It was great because everyone went up and built their own pizza and got exactly what they wanted.  One pizza is definitely perfect for a single serving, or maybe a little extra. The standard pizza is thin crust but you can ask for double dough for a thicker crust. The kiddos received heart shaped pizzas and were thrilled about it.  Between the food and the manager making it extra special, it was the perfect place to celebrate."}
{"text":"PizzaRev is the latest addition to the \"Subway\" style quick serve pizza joints popping up all over the place.  The process is the same as other similar restaurants-you go down the line choosing your crust (regular or gluten free- add $2), your sauce, cheeses, and additional toppings; then they fire it for 3 minutes.  They also offer salads, dessert pizza, beer, wine, and soft drinks from a Coke Freestyle machine.  I found PizzaRev to be my least favorite of the new pizza places like it.  It was okay, but in my opinion, Blaze and Pieology are far superior for crust, pizza size, and topping selection.  The flavor of the sauce, cheese and toppings was good, however, PizzaRev's crust reminded me of a matzo or water cracker.  It was so thin, crunchy, and tasteless.  It did hold up to the topping test though, so that's a plus.  The pizza size is also noticeably smaller than Blaze, but is slightly more expensive.  I also wished there were more veggie topping choices.    Now that Blaze is open across the street, I guess we'll see if there's room for both of these places on the corner of Sunset & Stephanie, but I know what my choice will be."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my pizza. Love the thin crust. My only complaint was the guy who made my pizza was a little heavy handed with the sauce. It was good, just a little too much sauce for my taste.  Next time will specify light sauce."}
{"text":"I stopped by after friends told me about them. I had a Thai pizza special and it was finger licking good! About 5PM and I didn't have the beers but I'll be back.  The staff was very friendly - they made suggestions to others.  It's very close to my house and I'm really glad to have this level of quality and goodness around!"}
{"text":"I have a diary allergy and this place has THE best vegan options. Not to mention Brandon and the staff go out of their way to make the experience a positive one. I never leave this place without a smile on my face. Great food and great company"}
{"text":"This place is great!!!! You have to come here on Tuesdays because it's unlimited toppings for ONLY $6.00.   The best way I can describe is... Think about eating at a Chipotle/subway. Now add a flat bread and start picking your toppings. It's takes about 4mins for them to cook the pizza. Pretty cool right? + the pizza I made was delicious.  Pepperoni, ham, chicken, meatball, olives & mushrooms. Mmmm mmmm yummy!"}
{"text":"The night crew is the best, friendliest, patient crew I've ever encountered. This is my first time here and they answered all of our questions with lovely smiles all around. They greet you as you're walking through the front door and the great smiles and service continues until you walk out.  The pizza dough is tasty and the topping choices are endless and fresh. Try their dessert pizza, its just as delicious as the rest of the menu. There is about 16 different beers on tap where you can help yourself too! This place is a MUST if you want great pizza, beer and service. 5pm to close is when the greatest people are doing their magic!"}
{"text":"My love for build your own pizza started at Pieology so it's basically my go to. Pizza Rev is the first one I've gone to since I discovered the greatness, but I feel like it wasn't quite what I wanted.   The girl that greeted us was friendly and informed us that the thin crust is very popular so we opted for that. I'm one of those people that love to fill the pizza with everything that looks delicious. I feel like I didn't get that much, but the thin crust still didn't hold up. All I added was sausage, onions, feta, cilantro, and mushrooms, with pesto at the end. The pizza was hard to eat. My boyfriend and I split it, but picked different toppings. I somehow ended up with only 2 pieces with my toppings, HOW?  The staff was nice and the restaurant is clean. I would come again if I had a craving, but sadly it won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Love this Pizza Rev location! The staff here are so friendly and get to know you after just a few visits. I travel for work and spend 5 days every other week in Vegas from LA and even though there are Pizza Rev locations in LA I would rather wait till I'm in Vegas just to have the warmth and friendly experience I get at this location, they know where I'm from, why I'm in town and even know that I have 2 pups....my pizza is always perfect too!"}
{"text":"Tried this new spot for make your own pizza. It was ok. Pieology and Blaze are so much better. Pizza Rev has less topping and cheese choices. Customer service is lacking. They were all out of napkins, forks and toilet paper in the bathroom."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great pizza with a cool vibe. Octavio is the best! He always strives to ensure we have an awesome experience. The taproom is really awesome too. A great place to catch a game with the huge tv's they have inside."}
{"text":"I don't know what place Mike F went to but that was definitely not my experience and I went there on the same day.  My girlfriend has Celiacs so the entire appeal to PizzaRev was the fact that they offered gluten free.  I thought the price (of the pizza) was great, the idea of a deli style pizza place was novel, and the convenience was amazing.  Now that's about all the good I can say about this place.  The staff was for the most part rude as I heard an employee correct a guest on the guests name.  The gluten free pizza was average to say the least (it's difficult to do gluten free well so I give them a pass as it was edible and not terrible) however the cook burned them.  The staff did a great job with the allergy and I always feel bad as this slows the cooking lines down no matter the restaurant.  But as the line got more and more backed up, the employees seemed frantic and the service went out the window with it.  So alongside the gluten free pizza, I ordered a standard dough pizza for myself.  Mine (which took a fraction of the time) was done first and left in a box on the counter till the other was done (about 20 minutes).  The bottom was burnt pretty bad so I had a burnt, soggy and cold pizza.  The salad price point is ridiculous seeing as how fast food joints give a better salad for less price.  I'm not sure if it was this place or the terrible BWW I had earlier that day, but my stomach did not feel well all night.  The part that really got me though was this was a pickup order too, done before the dinner rush.  We gave the place 45 minutes and it still came 30 minutes late.  There were a few things done well, but for the most part this was a huge mess.  I will give this place another try as the things it did well were awesome (mostly the convenience of their gluten free) but it still has a ways to go to."}
{"text":"First time here..Came with my daughter and we both ordered our own pizza and split a house salad. Our pizza was delicious and will come back again"}
{"text":"Gluten free options are nice. Pretty standard pizza. Nice selection of toppings. Easy and convenient location. This area needed more lunch options."}
{"text":"Choose your toppings $7.99 - perfect! Replay good selection of toppings. I prefer to get all meats with some select veggies. What was different than other make your own shops was the 4 different types of sausage, sun dried tomatoes, and chopped artichoke hearts. Just the basics outside of that. A surprise was the \"hot sauce\" selection by the napkins. The peach was really good, flavor with just the right amount of heat."}
{"text":"Pizza Rev is the Chipotle of pizza. I like that they offer already made pizza selections but also let you create your own and for a decent price. There's no set limit on how many toppings which is awesome too.   It's usually packed when I've gone but that's normal when the pizza is so good. I do not eat pork so I was SOOO happy they had beef pepperoni. I have not seen that offered at any other pizza shops besides halal or kosher places outside of Vegas. They also offer gluten free options which is really nice as well.   This place is delicious and perfect for a fast lunch or dinner :)  The personal pizzas are usually around $8 but if you go on Tuesday, you get them for $6 ;)"}
{"text":"Pizza is like Sex, when it's Good it's good and when it's bad it's still pretty good.... That said Pizzarev wasn't horrible nor was it great.   The Good.  -$6 Pizzas with unlimited toppings on Tuesdays.  - Vegan options, (dairy free crusts, Vegan cheese, vegan sausage, and good amounts of veggies)  - Tenaya Creek IPA on Draft (Plz pick up more local taps in the future)  - Service line style  - Allergen Menu on Website   The Not so Good...  - The Service line was dirty. Extreme cross contamination, there was mixed toppings in everything, and the employees didn't change gloves when handling the Vegan toppings and Vegetables - The Dough isn't anything special.  - The Sauce is lagging in Flavor  - The ingredients tasted like they belonged in a kids Lunchable   All in all I'll give them a second chance, I really want to like this place as they have dairy free options for my Dairy allergic (not lactose intolerant) Partner, this is somewhere we can actually have pizza together but the line needs to be kept cleaner and the employees need to use basic common food safety skills."}
{"text":"Great place to get pizza for a one set price, draft beer selection was great. Also has an app for every dollar you spend you get 1 point, 100 points collected gets you a free pizza."}
{"text":"I wanna give a shoutout to Branden the cashier. He was a very outgoing guy funny too. Was sitting at the bar so I was watching him take care of all the customers and he was very nice. Because of him I got to try Stella Artois. I was there for their Pizza & Beer deal. AMAZING deal by the way. Because him personally I'm in love with Stella and it's the only beer I drink lately."}
{"text":"Came in today around 2pm it was my first time here and the staff were nice. Des greeted me the whole way I crafted my first pizza on Double Dough overall a great experience I definitely recommend this place !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The only major flaw I find is that they ask you what meat items you want before the veggies. Meat needs to be on top of this style pizza to insure fully cooked. I wish the white sauce wasn't an Alfredo, and that they had a spicy red sauce. Nevertheless, customer service excellent, selections excellent, salads excellent, 100 flavor pop machine and lots of additional spices/sauces available. Price vs quality is very good"}
{"text":"Not impressed.. Go to Pizza Hut a couple blocks down. Better pizza and it costs less."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and pizzas were made at a fast pace. Delicious custom pizzas with unlimited toppings for 7.99. Defiantly would come back again."}
{"text":"First time here, excellent service! Bailey & Bridgette were very helpful, patient & friendly!  Great selection of toppings and sauces! I'm definitely coming back here! Will be posting again reviewing the pizza! Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening around 7:30. It was pretty packed, which to be expected at a new place.  The people working there were really friendly and working fast and hard.  The menu is pretty easy to understand and figure out what you want. They have vegan and gluten free options for a extra charge. Pizza Rev also has local beer on tap and bottled beer as well. Overall it was pretty good... Not the best pizza in the world but the happy hour is tempting."}
{"text":"YUMMMMM!!! $7.99 for unlimited toppings pizza. Think of it as chipotle but w pizza. A couple things I'd like to point out-- there is thin and double dough if you need a thicker crust, they have ANCHOVIES (yasss), they have dessert pizza (I don't think pieology has this option), and hey have beer and wine available here! I really enjoyed my pizza. The service was super nice. I can't wait to come back next week!"}
{"text":"I was there 2 weeks ago and I found hair in my food I spoke to a manager over the phone he told me come back in any time now they won't give me my food and the gm was very rude accusing me of getting free food"}
{"text":"The crust is perfect and the toppings are decent but this place really fell short with the cheese. Good pizza has to have amazing cheese and this place does not. It's not stringy and sort of clumps together. The sauce is also not so tasty. Really disappointed! I was hoping for a good pizza place by my house. Unfortunately not worth the price."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Tuesday for lunch. Forgot it was $6 pizza day, but the line moved surprisingly quickly for how slammed it was. The staff was all very pleasant and helpful. Even the GM Brandon was on the line keeping the flow going.   Got the double crust this time. Nice texture and flavorful. They've got a great selection of toppings and fresh veggies. Overall, a great place to grab a quick pizza. They even have beer and wine as well."}
{"text":"Good for a quick meal in the area. I'm having a hard time distinguishing it from Blaze pizza right down the street (except one note: Blaze has a nice patio). I guess whichever side of the road you're on determines which one you go to. Good crust with thin and thick options, different sauces, and a wide selection of toppings. I think it's $5.99 for a 1-topping pizza or $7.99 for as many toppings as you want. They also sell beer and they do a happy hour pizza and beer special for $10."}
{"text":"I was at Galleria and wanted somthing on the way home. I pondered the usual suspects, Chipotle, Sweet Tomatoes, Five Guys, Cafe Rio, etc. before I noticed that a new pizza place was open! I have just recently discovered Pieology, and I like the concept, so I thought I'd give Pizza Rev a try. The people were super friendly. They were smiling and laughing as I was making jokes about having no idea what I was doing. In the end, I got red sauce, mozzarella, spicy pepperoni, bacon,  Canadian bacon, spinach, mushrooms, onions, sun-dried tomatoes, and roasted garlic. It was an excellent combination, if I do say so myself! With a drink, it came out to  $10 and change, cheaper than Pieology. The crust here is crunchier, which I like. That plus it being close to my home puts this above Pieology for me. I will definitely be back. I might have to try one of their salads or desserts next time, as well!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I am a pizza fiend  I am however also a vegetarian. They have amazing vegetarian and vegan options for topping like vegan sausage or vegan cheese! They also have gluten free dough as well. All their ingredients are fresh, not frozen! The vegetables where crisp and the organic red sauce was delicious. It is only $7.99 to create your own pizza and you can pile on any or all the toppings for no extra charge! They have a lot of toppings to choose from. Different cheeses ranging from Italian blend to blue cheese or feta, different sauces like organic red sauce or white, different meats from your basic pepperoni to grilled chicken and of course lots of vegetables! It good quality pizza cooked in a pizza oven and made hot and fresh when ordered. They defiantly hook you up on sauce it was a little too saucy for me but if you love extra sauce in your pizza then it would be perfect! Next time I'll just order light sauce."}
{"text":"This place is the worst, service sucked first and then they were out of ingredients at open. My visit was right after open and at the beginning of lunch hours. They were out of chicken and the features pizza was Thai chicken. I, being a vegetarian, order the Thai chicken without chicken. The rude employee talks me out of my order based off not having chicken. I ordered anything that was left, no olives because they were out. This was a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Customer service is outstanding and pizza is amazing! Plus they serve beer! I would absolutely recommend and they even have vegan options. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"As a first time customer here, I was appalled by the lack of experience. Employees were not welcoming at all. I would have liked to see a little more customer/employee interaction and maybe some smiles. I'm not looking for them to walk me through the whole process but a little acknowledgement or a simple suggestion would have been nice. The workers behind the line seemed to just stare and pass along the pizza. Operations doesn't seem efficient as well. I'm glad we came when it was slower. I can only imagine how backed up they get during their rush. When the pizza was handed off to me the workers gave off a bothered vibe. They also seemed to be more concerned about personal matters and we're constantly talking amongst each other.   There was a gentleman constantly in the lobby \"cleaning.\" It would have been nice to see him clean the sneeze guard which was filthy. He kind of was just walking around pointlessly.   A lot of choices for hot sauce which I'm assuming the \"rev\" comes from. Quality was okay and so were the portions. Plenty of toppings to choose from too. The red sauce was great but the white sauce was just a little bland. Nice variety of wine, beers and sodas. The restaurant itself has a nice layout. Honestly the food isn't that memorable.   It's very affordable and you get a decent amount of food. If I were you I'd spend my 8 bucks elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I just can't recommend it.  The first time was so-so.  I ordered a pizza off the pre-set menu and then still had to answer yes/no to most of the ingredients despite asking for it to be made as described.  The second time I did the same thing but this time they did at least attempt to build the pizza from the menu.  They were doing great until at the last step when they forgot one thing.  So, when they asked if that was all I offered the missing ingredient: Fennel Seeds.  Aaaaandd, the employee grabbed a handful of capers and covered the pizza with them. These things happen and so I was apologetic about my request to remake it.  I really hate capers.  I paid and sat down assuming they would get it right on the second go at it.  Lets just say that was clearly expecting too much."}
{"text":"Tuesday is Pizza day, meaning it's all day $6 pizzas!! Because the pizzas are good, it makes Pizza day amazing! :)  The trick is not to get too many toppings, even though you can get unlimited toppings.  If you get too many toppings, it weighs down the pizza and ends up being soggy.  I would say, don't get more than 3-4 toppings.   Disclaimer, if it's too busy, they might hurry the process and the sauce/cheese/topping ratio gets inconsistent. For example, the cheese may not cover the sauce, the toppings end up in the middle, or the as it's put in the box, the toppings slide more to one side of the pizza.   Maybe I'll see you there on Pizza Tuesday!"}
{"text":"$6 Rev Tuesdays, yo.  PizzaRev isn't the best customizable pizza chain, but it's the cheapest on one particular day of the week. I'm always willing to wait around for Tuesday, and until now, it's always been a quick drive to one near my home. On this Tuesday, however, I was on the Strip with a friend, and he reacted eagerly when I brought up the idea, so we dropped in for a late dinner.  I was surprised that there were barely any other customers inside, and that's in absolute terms, not just relative to the massive, open-plenum dining room and reasonable, fenced-in outdoor patio. I know it's a weekday, the weather is finally cooling, and the location is not really on the Strip, but I figured that it's central enough that it would be more well-trafficked than it was.  End result: it ended up being one of the fastest pizza line experiences in recent memory because we (1) barely had anybody in line ahead of us and (2) the employees were fast and not perpetually hesitant like most of the Henderson PizzaRev folks seem to be.  Unless you're boring and willing to settle for their preset topping combos, you're gonna want to go wild to get the most out of your money. Start with the signature thin crust ($7.99 normally, and goes down to $6.00 on Tuesdays) unless you want to pay a $1.30 premium for double dough or gluten-free. Afterward, slowly walk down the line as they ask for your desired ingredients in this order: sauce (they'll mix sauces if desired, but I'm usually fine with just one), cheese, veggies, and meats (an odd switcheroo from the meats-then-veggies order of Henderson and of other chains). Then pay and either wait for a to-go order or find yourself a seat.  I experienced some mixed surprises at this point. The pleasant surprise was that an employee actually brought the post-oven pizzas over to our table, rather than calling us to the counter to pick up the dine-in orders as I've seen in other similar stores. The unfortunate surprise was that they were entirely out of their PizzaRev-branded sauces save for Jalapeño. Where are the Mango Bonney or Chipotle sauces that would've elevated my bites? What about something like Peach Vidalia or Datil Pepper or even the dreaded Ghost Pepper? No? Well, I wasn't feeling the urge to toss on some Cholula or Sriracha, so I ultimately passed.  Fortunately, they did have the pesto drizzle which I've found to be a near-staple (you may wanna ask before the end of the line about this, due to their unusual level of service), as well as some dried oregano and plenty of chili pepper flakes. These played well enough with my sufficiently crispy cracker-esque crust, (mildly) spicy red sauce, array of cheeses (mozzarella, bleu, and ricotta for me), and copious amounts of veggies and meats to make the pizza a satisfying meal.  I should add a couple more notes on their downsides, lest the insufficient sauce supply wasn't enough to justify the downgrade. Most importantly to newbies, they had zero labels for anything beyond the sauce. It was an issue for my friend, but fortunately, I'm so experienced that I don't just recognize toppings on sight, but also (probably) can recite my typical order by memory. The other concern, a nitpick at best, is that they might be just a tad less generous on toppings than at least the Henderson location; maybe they're used to people like me? I'll have to pay more attention if I can so that I can ask for a 1.5x or double helping of one or two things.  PizzaRev is an awesome chain on Tuesdays, and they're not too shabby on other days of the week. I've got work tomorrow, so I'll have to come back to this unique location when I have a better opportunity to try the self-serve taproom (pricing determined with the aid of RFID or NFC or whatever fancy tech they have in those wristbands). I probably will continue to breeze past the Craft Your Own salads, but maybe you won't?"}
{"text":"I'd talk about how the revolution has arrived in Henderson, but I'm not gonna make a cheesy pizza pun.  Whoops, guess I just did.  PizzaRev is a LA-based pizza chain that's starting to expand to other states. It was founded in 2012 (the same year as Blaze Pizza, and one year after Pieology) so it's not one of the real pioneers of the fast-casual, build-your-own pizza movement. As a fan of the restaurants serving what some would call Chipotle-style pizza, I was excited that PizzaRev's newest location was in my neighborhood, and I made sure I was one of the first customers on the day of their official grand opening.  Today, as one of their promotions, they're giving one pizza per person for a \"pay what you want\" donation to a local nonprofit (After School All Stars). They suggest $8, and I'm sure I'd have given much less in other circumstances, but I was in for $5.  The reason for the Chipotle comparison is obvious if you've been to Chipotle. Unless you're super lazy and just wanna default to their presets, you choose the type of food you want, starting with the format (normal pizza, +$2 gluten-free dough if that's your thing, or salad), the sauce(s)/dressing(s) (red for me), and as many of the cheeses, meats and veggies as you'd like (check their web site for the menu). Then they bake it up in about 3 minutes and bring it out to you if you're eating in. Takeout is fine too, although the crust won't stay crispy).  The crust was crunchy and didn't sag in the middle even though I loaded my pizza up. The tomato sauce was noticeable even though it was a thin layer, and the standard mozzarella, the creamy ricotta, and the feta cheeses all contributed nicely. Out of the meats that I chose, I noticed the delicious smoky bacon the most, although pepperoni, Italian sausage, sweet fennel sausage, and crumbled beet meatballs all were appreciated.  As for the veggies, I had no complaints. Fresh arugula (placed on the side for you to add instead of letting the oven destroy it) and mushrooms stood out. The roasted corn, which I believe is their special ingredient of the month, wasn't impactful. I love corn, so that's a bit disappointing. Basil pesto, hot sauce, and BBQ sauce finishes are available, but I neglected to ask. As for condiments that you can add yourself, they have parmesan, crushed red pepper flakes, dried oregano, and a surprising array of hot sauces including the increasingly ubiquitous Sriracha.  I can't fault them on anything flavor-wise, but I've become increasingly aware of how not-full I am right now. The pizzas didn't look very big, and I agree with Lon L is right about the paper-thin crust. The overall portion size fails the eyeball test, the mouth test, and the stomach test. It's fine for lunch or a snack, but not a dinner. I've easily been able to reach satiety then take some leftovers from other similar pizza chains, so this is a pretty big issue if you're looking for value.  Despite that one significant problem, I'm sure I'll return to PizzaRev until another similar pizza chain appears in my neighborhood. The short drive is too good to pass up, and my taste buds were happy the whole time. Maybe I'll fill in the rest of my stomach space with a dessert pizza, cookie, or alcoholic beverage, all of which are also available here."}
{"text":"Very good pizza place!  We came on $6 Rev Tuesday's.  All-day unlimited toppings.  Finally my wife gets the pizza she really wants!!!  My only complaint was the sauce was a little sweet.   Other than that I enjoyed my pizza and will definitely be back on Tuesday!!!"}
{"text":"Just recently visited and was super disappointed.  The pizza crust was burnt to the point you could taste the burnt pieces and it ruined the taste of the pizza.  Sigh :("}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of pizza revs in Cali and all three in Las Vegas so yes a little different between them all but this location on sunset near the sunset station in Las Vegas takes the cake. If it is a create your own pizza don't tell me my max is basically 7 pepperoni slices on my pizza wthhhh.... so I had to get all three pepperoni on my pizza which still didn't add up to what I can do in cali.... y'all betta wake up cuz that's not cool at all...my wife said no wonder the other locations are so much more crowded"}
{"text":"It's okay, the pizza is super small but they put a huge amount of food on it! It's chipotle but for pizza. They only had 3 sauces: organic, regular red sauce and white sauce. They have a lot of ingredients you can pick from, unfortunately since they don't change gloves or use spoons/tongs I couldn't share with my BF and he couldn't eat anything due to his allergy. I liked that they gave a lot but I didn't like the cross contamination. They piled everything in the center and didn't really spread it out evenly on my thing crust pizza, the center was all oil and everything was falling off. The cheese had more flavor than anything else, even though I got about 3 kinds of meat and several veggies. Overall, I'd go back since it's cheap pizza and they seem to have great combo deals."}
{"text":"Seriously lacking in so many ways.   Pizza Rev is part of a newer trend in pizza places where you can have your own pizza creation made to your specifications right in front of you. Think Subway meets pizza and you're headed in the right direction.   I went here on a Thursday right before 5:00 and things started out fine. I ordered a build your own with fairly standard toppings: pepperoni, bacon, onions, yellow peppers, roasted garlic, and ricotta cheese. The two girls that were working were friendly enough and my pizza was done pretty quickly.   While waiting for my order a few more employees started appearing from the back. Apparently done with their shift they proceeded to have a conversation with each other from across the restaurant, yelling to be heard. One of them kept shouting to the others if he could have the change in the tip jar. He eventually just took it when they couldn't hear him.   In terms of flavor...well, there wasn't any. While I could tell the ricotta cheese was there by the texture, it had no taste at all. The crust as well was rather bland.   This isn't a place I'd recommend at all as there are better options in terms of the build your own pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"I love their pizza! Make it your way! What's not to love! I order online but waiting in line is cool too. Pizza and beer only $9.95! $6 Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"This is only the second PizzaRev location I have tried and it stands out compared to the other. It is larger and more open to start with. It also is a taproom. That means rather than just a few select bottles beers behind the counter, you can pour your own beer from a bevvy of taps on the wall in the 21 and older section. Sadly I was not able to experience that on my visit today. I came in on my lunch break from a job that frowns upon drinking while on the job. But that doesn't mean I didn't take notice. And you best believe I will come back some time I am not on the clock to take full advantage of what this PizzaRev Taproom has to offer.  I stuck with just a pizza today. A standard thin crust with standard tomato sauce and standard cheese. I dressed it up with spicy pepperoni, bacon, olives, MUSHROOMS, basil and roasted garlic. This is close a normal order for me. I know what I like and this embodies that.  I did not dine in today. I took my pizza to go and drove back to my office a few mile away. The pizza was good but would have been better had I eated it hot out of the oven. My biggest complaint was that my pie was left in just a minute too long. I saw the oveb attendant checking it but he took it out to late. The crust was more charred and more crisp than I prefer. That is not to say I didn't enjoy every bite. It was delicious. Just not perfect.  This PizzaRev is across the parking lot from Chick-Fil-A so the lot is packed amd difficult to navigate. But if you make it through that, park and go on in. You can get a good pizza and potentially good beer. Aint nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"I came to PizzaRev with my uncle last week. It was my way of paying him for some work he was helping with around the house. I had never been to PizzaRev prior but he had been to one in California and said it was good. So we checked out this location.  It was a Friday evening around 8:00 and the place was pretty busy. It took a few minutes to get through the line which gave me ample time to see my options. I went with a standard single crust and their traditional marinara sauce. I also chose the mozzarela cheese. Seems pretty ordinary so far. Then I added spicy pepperoni, crispy bacon, mushrooms, and black olives. To freshen it up a bit I asked for fresh basil. It all worked really well and made a delicious pizza. I appreciate the ability to customize my pizza and pay one flat amount. The pizza is baked fresh and comes to the table piping hot. I had to wait several minutes before chowing down. The first slice or two I had to eat with a fork.   PizzaRev is not entirely unique in its concept but it is enjoyable. Blaze Pizza is pretty much the same and nearly across the street. Both do what they do and do it right. I cannot in good conscience say which I prefer better as they are on an even playing field. I can say that I like the fact that PizzaRev has their pizza for $1 less on Tuesdays. That works for me."}
{"text":"In terms of pizza, I really can't ask for more!! This is by far the best pizza I have ever had!!! It is a create your own pizza place. You select your thin or double dough and whatever the toppings that you want! From the ordering to getting the pizza ready only took less than 10 minutes! They were super fast! And the pizza was delicious! This is going to be my go to place for pizza from now onwards!"}
{"text":"Great new local spot!! The happy hour deal is great...make sure that you go early in the day. You can add all your own toppings.. make sure you try the red sauce.."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Not only is the pizza great, they also have delicious gluten free pizza, I have a six year old son whom as of recently has to be gluten free for medical reasons and finding his favorite food (pizza) in gluten free that actually doesn't taste like cardboard has been so difficult, he was so happy today, and to top it off this place has some of the BEST customer service I've experienced in a long time, everyone is nice, friendly and funny, we felt so welcome! This will be our new Tuesday eat out spot (they have a $2 off deal on Tuesday) reasonably priced, we're a family of 5 soon to be 6 so always keeping an eye out for affordable family restaurants, this is going to the top of our list! Thanks pizza rev! Y'all rock"}
{"text":"As a former New Yorker , I am super picky with my pizza. This place was a surprising delight. I love being able to custom make my own pizza and pick all my favorite toppings. Sun dried tomatoes are amazing on pizza FYI."}
{"text":"I came at 12:00 and was about the 40th person in line. It was my first time so I took the line as a sign of good pizza. I was right.   The staff was super friendly and helped me through the process of building my pizza. It only took a few minutes in the pizza oven and my personal pie was ready. It was a great balance of toppings (it should be, I picked them out)! It was a good value for my dollar.  I'm looking forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"The staff deserve five stars. Sadly, no way to delineate the ratings.   If this is someone's first experience with the fast pizza model I hope they don't hold it against other \" build your own\" places.  The pizza itself tastes flat. Maybe the toppings are good but they are overshadowed by a too sweet red sauce and flavorless dough. The cheese hasn't any of the funk I associate with real cheese. It also has that weird plasticity mouth feel of the cheese on a Costco pizza. Why waste the money on \"buffalo cheese\" if they make it taste like nothing? Why source local produce when possible if you purposefully choose to lay it on a tasteless base ?  They do have roast garlic, which is nice.   I feel that In an effort to be non offensive to most pallettes the food here is what you would expect at olive garden.   Bottom line : inoffensive pizza, You can get better  tasting build your own pizza elsewhere at a similar price point. This Is a new generations supply chain slapped onto an older generation's taste buds"}
{"text":"This place has improved since my previous visits, still not my favorite \"craft your own\" pizza joint, but for the simple fact that this location is so close to me, I'm pleased to see that customer service, cleanliness and taste has improved."}
{"text":"Enrique madame a bomb ass salad!!!! Best attitudes for service in this location. They are always upbeat and friendly!"}
{"text":"Went in today and line was about 10 people deep but moved relatively quick. Ordered 4 pizzas and an oreo desert pizza. 2 were cheese only, 1 pepperoni, last was pepperoni, sausage, canadian bacon, onion, olive, mushroom. I wanted the sweet fennell saisage but the worker was too busy looking at the oven to listen to me. Went to pay and the cashier over charges for the cheese pizzas. They were supposed to be $5.99 each and she charged us $7.99 each. Addressed it with the manager and she gave us the difference in cash. The drinks are free refills with one of the coke machines where you can pick whatever soda that you want. Overall the pizza was good. We also ordered the pizza with double dough which made it a little thicker and, I thought, better. My one suggestion would be to order with extra sauce as the sauce tends to run to the edges and is very minimal in the middle of the pizza. I felt that the pizza was better quality than Pieology."}
{"text":"A pizza place that allows unlimited toppings, yum!   Thank you Camille and your amazing staff for making my first visit amazing. My pizza was so delicious that I was craving it for the next two days.  They offer 3 different crust options thin crust, regular crust and double crust. I ordered double crust with a green and white sauce and it was the best pizza ever.   They also offer beer and wine. Yum! A customized pizza with unlimited toppings and yummy desserts. Win!   I love their chocolate chip cookies. The two times I've visited they were just coming out of the oven."}
{"text":"Terrible service! All of the employees were completely high!!! I had to spell my name 4x and explain my dough choice 4x- there are only 2 dough choices! Then adding the sauce was painful to watch! One of the other employees noticed the struggle and attempted to help, but watching the toppings was like watching a scene in slow motion! My pizza was barely warm afterwards, and the employees were less than satisfactory!!! I would rather wait in line at Blaze than ever return to this establishment! They are exceptionally rude to a family who had not been there before & were seemingly confused about the process! Instead of being helpful they were condescending & rude to her. I doubt she will be coming back because I know I won't!"}
{"text":"This PizzaRev is my favorite spot in town! Great location, fast efficient service, friendly staff, and perfect food! The GM Richard is super friendly and goes out of his way to make your visit the best. Des went out of her way to help us find their specialty hotsauce Peach Vidalia and she always has a smile!  Tuesday 6$ pizzas are an unbeatable value! If you haven't checked it out, you're missing something special!"}
{"text":"Whether or not you like the pizza, you'll love the service. They have a great staff who all have very positivity and uplifting personalities. And you don't find that everywhere. The pizza is pretty good and being in a positive place like this makes it that much better. So try it at least once. It'll be a great experience."}
{"text":"If you think that there is no such thing as bad pizza, go here and challenge your beliefs.  You can taste the can in the tomato sauce, while the cheese tastes like nothing... Dough is under-developed and also bland. For $8 you'll get a pretty big wheel of disappointment so if you're just looking to stuff your piazza-pie hole and don't care how it tastes this will satisfy. If you go here and leave thinking \"that was really great pizza\" you may want to have your tastebuds checked."}
{"text":"The competition between make your own pizza joints in Henderson is tough. With two places across the street from each other, you really need to be on your A+ game and sadly you weren't PizzaRev. 2/2 visits I was left disappointed.  The pizzas are decently sized, with as many toppings as you want. Quantity, check. Quality, not so much. The crust is boring and both times burnt. The pizza was not \"thin crust,\" but instead just plain hard. The toppings didn't taste particularly fresh and it just made me keep saying, \"I could make this better at home...\"  The employees are friendly, but also seem more engrossed in their conversations between themselves than helping customers.  Best of luck to you guys!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Las Vegas and stumbled upon this place. Quality service, would rate them 5 stars on this alone. However the pizza toppings/choices aren't really different than other build your own pizzas, for this reason alone makes the place average."}
{"text":"Yaaasss! The night staff here is AMAZING! Pizza was delicious, but the staff blew it out of the park! We just left, and the Sunday night staff was just so extremely happy, it blew our minds. They're so genuine, helpful, and customer oriented it was awesome!   Ordering here is simple, there's a few different dough choices; we opted for the double dough (9.29$) otherwise they have the thin crust (5.99$) I'm not a fan of red sauce, so I did the olive oil, my boyfriend did the organic spicy tomato which was AMAZING!!! When we go back, that's my next choice. Loaded mine with buffalo milk mozzarella, chicken, shrooms, bacon, jalapenos, and spinach. Took a few minutes to cook, and BAM eating time. My nd basically got a meat lovers with cilantro.   My pizza was phenomenal! Cooked perfect, with crispy crust and so gooey with all that cheese! My bf ate his entire pizza while I was on my 2nd slice, THAT GOOD.   I love the hot sauce choices here, their cayenne hot sauce has a kick to it, the mango garlic was ok, and the Booney mango was good.   Their soda machine is pretty amazing and all high-tech!  The food was delicious, but the real reason to go here is the customer service from the crew! They were just so happy! I love them, they're seriously amazing!"}
{"text":"the food is INCREDIBLE! its all high quality ingredients and they make it in front of you, best pizza ive ever had! the staff are extremely friendly! and they have an alcohol selection! lol im sold! ill DEFINITELY be back in the future!  BRAVO!"}
{"text":"The quality of the pizza it's decent, I just don't understand what's the purpose of customizing your own pizza when there is a  limit on toppings that you can put on your pie, so for $10 doble dough, I don't think is worth it, the soda machine is missing flavors, and the drink station is not in order, I have been coming here for a while I can tell they are losing business . NOT Worth it.."}
{"text":"Pizza & customer service here are both great! Definitely a  go to if you like pizza! You can create your own personalized pizza or pick one of their traditional ones. They have a good selection of toppings, its basically a Subway version of pizza but better! They also have dessert pizza & beer/wine! Pizzas on tuesdays are $6!"}
{"text":"Tried the 'rev for the first time. First impressions - it's literally a \"subway\" but for pizza. I even heard one of the workers there explain it this way to a customer.   You get 3 choices of crusts and a huge selection of unlimited toppings. Or you can choose one one of their pre-selected menu items. I opted for a thin crust and it came out great.   The kids' size pizza is a little on the smaller end but not a bad value as it comes with a drink and cookie or applesauce. My 2 year old son was able to eat the whole thing by himself.   As far as drinks, they have a beer selection as well as a coke freestyle machine.  The only downside to this place for me was that it was unfortunately really dirty when I went. The tables needed a good wipe down and there was just bits of food everywhere on the ground."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. Plenty of elbow space for customers who want to come in for a quick lunch. They serve 11\" pizzas. You can put any topping you want on them. Great service, great price."}
{"text":"I heard good things about PizzaRev, and it looks like I'm one of the last people in my circle of peeps to try it out. I was prompted to go because our volunteer clinic had a fundraiser here. They give 20% back to your organization, so it's great if you're looking to do some fundraising!  I got the double crust margherita pizza with sausage on top. They said the double crust is supposed to rise a little more and have more bite to it. It is an extra charge, so be aware of that if you want the double crust.  When I got my pizza, it was still really thin. I couldn't see a big difference between the regular crest and double crust. I feel like I paid an extra dollar or two for about 0.5mm extra crust which isn't all that great. The size of it is okay. A little small in my opinion because since it's thin crust, you can end up eating about 1.5 pizzas before being full. I didn't leave full. I had to supplement my pizza with some Chik-fil-A across the way.  The flavor of it is pretty good. They hand rip the basil so when you smell your pie, you just get this huge waft of warm, fragrant basil and man, I think I fell in love a little bit there. The cheese was just right. Not too much, but not too stingy with the cheese.  Overall, PizzaRev is a good place for lunch with a few friends, but I didn't leave full. If you're coming with about 3-4 people, you're probably best getting the $40 deal that comes with drinks, pizzas, and a dessert pizza. It'll probably be enough to get you nice and satiated."}
{"text":"Amazing I love it you get to load up your pizza as much as you want and it's still the same price. Definitely can't complain about this place one but everyone is super nice that was on staff as well."}
{"text":"Pizza rev is great. Gluten free options, beef pepperoni,  unlimited toppings, 6 buck Tuesdays,  garlic cloves or minced. 5 min to bake. Not enough good things to say. Organic sauce too, can't miss."}
{"text":"This place hands down is one of the best in town. Their pizzas are so delicious and their customer service is always on point! My family and I have had their pizzas about 1/2 dozen times now and we're never disappointed. I set price to include whatever topping you want...how can you beat that?!?!"}
{"text":"This is a neat spot! Make your own pizza. Biggest issue is I can't decide between all the yummy toppings! And for the beer lovers, there are 18 different beers on tap. Yes Please! I'll be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Just love pizza rev all the toppings you can choose organic and close to my office!  Love the pesto sauce too!"}
{"text":"This is a solid option for pizza or a quick meal in Henderson.  The ordering process is simple. You enter at the beginning and work through the line choosing toppings like Subway or Chipotle. While you pay the pizza is fired up and it isn't a long wait before the pizza comes out. Pizzas are priced the same no matter the number on toppings. At the register they only ask how many pizzas, not what toppings are on the pizza. That definitely makes it easy. Pizzas are inexpensive.   There are a decent number of options for toppings. Plenty of veggie and meat toppings. There are also several sauce options ranging from red (organic!) to pesto to white sauce. Several types of cheese are available as well. The restaurant even offers gluten free and vegan options which is nice. In addition to pizza they offer salads and a few desserts.  My pizza was tasty. The crust was thin and crispy, the red sauce had a nice flavor, and the cheese was tasty as well. My salad contained mixed greens versus iceberg lettuce with a delicious Italian dressing and croutons on the side.   I'd recommend dining in for the best pizza. We ordered our food to go and it was barely lukewarm even though we only had to drive five minutes."}
{"text":"I think Blaze Pizza is better.  They have more choices for toppings and more sauces to choose from.  Still hard to find good pizza in Vegas, being from New York and all."}
{"text":"Note the 1 star lest of 5 stars again is due to hubby' s veggie and meat pizza flaw: the chicken was cold.  I came to love Pizza Rev since my first time a year ago. This location is a hit or miss though. Usually we get stingy pizza makers. I often want to revise my review for a 2 stars for that. But the last trip I have to give them cuddos because I'm pregnant and really NEEDED my Pizza Rev lol! I live west pass Blaze Pizza on W. Sahara and Hualapai but would drive down to PR on Rancho or Rainbow because I love PR and don't really like BP (due to lacking yummy hot sauces like PR, vegan cheese, vegan sausages and sun dried tomatoes) unless my husband is too lazy to drive. The Rainbow location is an easier drive compare to the one on Rancho. But due to the Rainbow location's inconsistency, we frequent the Rancho location instead. The last trip to the Rancho location this past weekend 04/14or15(?), we got there at 9pm and it was closed when sign and website said they're open until 11pm. Like said Im pregnant and really NEEDED PR at that time lol! I almost lost my mind thinking I wont get it and we skipped BP by us for it lol. Anyway my husband was sweet enough to drive me all the way to the Rainbow location. I was hoping to God I get a good pizza maker to load me up some extra pineapples and extra vegan sausages on top of my vegetarian pizza, or else I wouldn't mind buying 2 pizzas since we already went around the world for it. The little Asian girl was awwwesome! Made my pizza just perfect! In fact, I want to go back again like right NOW...I think I actually will lol. Thanks little lady!"}
{"text":"Tried to come this past weekend (cant remember if sat or sun) at a bit past 9pm and they were closed! There were a couple of other people who came the same time as us and was confused also. Drove here from W. Sahara and Hualapai literally passing/choosing it over Blaze Pizza! We ended up driving to the one on Rainbow, such an inconvenience! Their sign and website says they close at 11pm. Don't care if business is slow for the night, they'd lose more business if they keep doing that. For example: I wanted Pizza Rev again last night, but I didn't bother coming to this location."}
{"text":"Wifey got a double dough with red sauce, chicken, bacon, red onion, pineapple and roasted garlic. She notes that the crust is flavorful and crispy. The sauce is \"better than a normal tomato sauce\" (go easy, she's not as culinarily verbose as I).   All in all, a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service! The staff was friendly and the GM Brandon went above & beyond to make sure we were satisfied with our meal & gave us a good laugh. Will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"The staff was so kind and made us feel right at home. The pizza was delicious. I couldn't ask for more. I will definitely be back soon to try the beers!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza, lots of options and fresh ingredients an No Grease! Enjoyed the portion size for the price it's worth it. Also in a up and coming location in Southwest."}
{"text":"Took my money and refuse to refund!!!!!!   Ordered online at 913pm got a call back like 10 minutes later stating they were closed (even though it clearly states open till 10) ok what ever I was told that my card would be refunded within 24 hours...I waited 2 days called back and was told 3 days ok nothing I call back today (day number 10) and I'm told it should hit today but we will call you back...They call back and say the last 4 of your card number isn't in our system so it had to be refunded (well it wasn't) and now you want me to have to go to my bank and track this stuff down? Really? I'm a mom with an autistic 7 year old who doesnt have time to track peoples mistakes down...And then the employee has the nerve to say I'm being rude because I'm getting loud? YOU HAVE NOT HEARD ME BEING LOUD YET......WHEN I GET TO YOUR STORE SCREAMING YOU WILL HEAR LOUD.  ARE YOU PEROPLE SERIOUS? Just refund my $17.xx or make it right"}
{"text":"I ordered a thin crushed personal cheese pizza. A seemingly great value for a pizza at $6.68. What I received looked like a box of paper thin nachos. Quite tasty. For a box of nachos anyway."}
{"text":"Placed an online order 2 hours in advance for a 5:45 pm pick up its now 5:57 and no pizza insight!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Brandon the assistant manager is the man! And all the folks working there have the best personalities and customer service! The pizza is not to be missed! And the toppings are plentiful!"}
{"text":"Great concept, great food, great service a totally fun place to grab a bite to eat.  Last time I was there they were out of some items and the cashier was confused about the wines offered, which I just attributed to workng out the glitches of a new establishment.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"i just want to say that i have had amazing service both times that i have been to this place!!! kira and neya are amazing....they have the bomb customer service and made me feel welcomed...and cared for. they gave me great options to choose from...they did not rush me...and made me feel right at home. on top of that....my pizza was finger licking good, i had to go back for the 2nd time this week. even the manager octavio was amazing and had great customer service. i can't wait to go back and take my kids there to experience this amazing pizza experience!!! thank you guys so much for the amazing experience ...and for my custom bomb.com pizza lol. can't wait to go back!!! keep up the good work and seevice!"}
{"text":"Fairly long wait for a make it your own pizzeria. Took about 15 minutes in and out. The craft your own place by my house take about 3. Fairly decent pizza though. Would still recommend. And a plus for being friendly. But they probably don't need to staff so many workers at a time. Seemed like it slowed the process down."}
{"text":"I ordered at 11:30 for a pizza.  I got the email and expected it in about an hour.  I received a message at 12:11 pm that my order was on the way.  Right on time  (I work .4 miles from the store).  I received another text message at 12:24 saying it was on its way.  I called at 12:44 and was told the driver \"returned\" and my pizza had to be \"remade.\"  NO explanation just SORRY.  He said they guy just left.  After 1pm i received my pizza.  Which was cold.  The Door Dash driver said they sent him out with a COLD pizza, so he returned it for them to cook it.  Of course PizzaRev said the Driver was late and that was why.  Horrible customer service.  Lettuce was wilted and the pizza wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Love this place. Such good pizza! Always ends up high quality and just how I want it. Changed the way I eat pizza to be completely honest! Shoutout to the Friday night crew :P"}
{"text":"HEY YOU reading this, this place is GREAT! We came for a lunch during the week, and they moved us through pretty fast.  Michael (super nice and helpful) explained to us how it works: you either choose a preset ingredients or design it yourself, it's the same price $7.99.   Overall it's Healthy: the crust is super thin so fewer carbohydrates (there is a gluten free option). Most ingredients are organic or locally sourced (awesome!)  and the price 7.99 is just right.   Bonus: they offer a pizza (design it yourself) and a beer for 9.99 amazing deal. Everyday from 4-6pm and after 830pm. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Pizza Rev has quickly become my favorite pizza place in Las Vegas!! My boyfriend always liked Round Table, but now says Pizza Rev tops it!! We especially loved Brandon's lively, charismatic and helpful personality. I would come to Pizza Rev for the pizza, but we would definitely come to this location for the outstanding service as well. Not to mention the prices here are so reasonable for the quality ingredients they use. AND...They even have a Vegan option!! 5 stars to me!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite build your own pizza joint in town. Staff is friendly, toppings are fresh, pizza sauce is good, and the pizza is always nice and crisp. I like that burnt flavor on a pizza and you always get that here."}
{"text":"Had the double dough and picked out my own toppings very happy and it's delicious totally recommend this place"}
{"text":"I definitely dig the whole idea of customizing your pizza and getting it cooked in an open fire pit! It's definitely adds a more nostalgic feel. Plus it definitely gives motivation for your kid to eat their customer made fire pit grill, or at least I would like to think so.   This particular location is located in a plaza, so you do have variety on what to eat, but none of the other places had pizza on their menu, it's also not too far away from the shopping center off of Rainbow, so if your looking to eat before you shop they this is your place to hit up when your craving some pizza. I do enjoy the Alfredo sauce option for your sauce choice. I get it all the time and add my veggies, it's as if I am eating pasta but instead of the noodles I have pizza dough. So I would recommend this place if your looking for something unique, because you can definitely add as many topping as you like or purchase a creation on their menu. My favorite toppings are artichoke,spinach,olives, and peppers.  My husband loves his massive meat and veggie toppings, my kiddo like his cheese pizza with different cheeses."}
{"text":"We came in the last ten minutes before closing, (already feeling bad for being THOSE people), but the workers were more than happy to serve us. Vanessa, Brandon and Carlos were more than pleasant, they were personable and extremely friendly. They even went to the extent of grabbing ingredients from the back because they had run out of the ones we wanted. I truly enjoyed my experience at PizzaRev and will be coming back next time my pizza cravings hit (aka tomorrow). Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Totally not impressed.  You can get anything on your pizza for one price, (which by the way is not clear on the paper menu or the menu board) but don't expect it to be a lot of any of it,   Ordered a thin pizza and it had the fennel sausage and a few other things on it.  Fennel sausage as in 5 pieces of fennel sausage.  The pizza was out before I even got my soda filled up.  I thought, \"wow, that was fast.  Pretty cool!  That oven must be hot as hell.\"  I'm excited because I am thinking that crust was going to be crispy, just like I like it.  Nope.  It was a tiny bit crispy on the very edge, but the rest was like warm dough. This pizza reminded me of a microwave pizza.  One bite and everything fell off because there was way too much sauce.    I would have been happier with a $1 Totino's pizza from the frozen section at the grocery store. On a side note:  I am not a wine drinker, but if I were, I would be totally turned off by the wine glasses that were hanging above the beer taps.  They were very cloudy and unclean looking.  Like another reviewer stated:  Nothing really came together for me.  I am not sure I am willing to go a second round."}
{"text":"The food is good and the restaurant is very clean.  The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because the staff and manager.  The manager yelled at the staff person who was across the restaurant applying the sauce about not putting it all the way to the edges.  They aren't very friendly to each other and it made it an odd dinning experience."}
{"text":"I love choices and PizzaRev lets you create the pizza you want without up charging you .50 cents here or a $1.00 there. 1 price for as many toppings, what's not to love! The pizza crust was thin and crispy, they use the finest organic ingredients (score) and you get to choose your toppings (double score)! The pizzas are bigger then the average personal pizza and it was delicious!  Great price for good pizza. Minus 1 star because service was a little week and it took 5 minutes to even be helped!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place, the ingredients are excellent compared to it's competitor.  I was pleased with the crust options.  I felt like I stood in line too long because the maker was slower but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"If you like Blaze fast-fired Pizza, then you will enjoy this place. It is the same concept. You start at the front of the line and choose your crust (Thin or thick crust). Then you choose your toppings. They have a vegan cheese option here too. Once you choose your toppings the pizza goes in the oven and a few minutes later a server calls you to the counter to retrieve your pizza. I was there during the lunch rush and the staff seemed to be very efficient. The one thing that sets this place apart from Blaze is the sauce. The organic red sauce is outstanding!!  I definitely will be back. I recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"I have to admit that this place is decent. However there are just some service adjustments that should be made in order to make this place up to par. The employees are friendly, but they seemed a little scattered when it comes to organization. It's cohesion that is key and when I walked in with my family it was a little after 2pm still pretty busy but the wait to get a pizza made took 10-15 then another 10-15 to get your pizza. The dough was decent, I wish they cooked it a little longer to fully get the dough cooked. It was a little flimsy closer toward the middle. My biggest complaint for this is my sister had placed an online to go order as we sat down and it took about 25 mins to get the order when they weren't busy any longer. When my sister approached the register to ask about her to go order the employee walked away and about 5 mins later she noticed they hadn't made the pizza though the app said it was boxed and ready! I found it terrible service that they didn't have a response as to why the pizza wasn't ready yet! Bad customer service and to have wasted 25 mins after eating our meal to wait for an online order we had placed at that time 35 mins before was terrible! What's the point of an app with a progress tracker if it's totally inaccurate!"}
{"text":"Fast service, workers are kind for the most part. Restaurant seating is pretty clean."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza spot in Vegas now. I'm so happy they opened one near my house. I went today with my girl friend and we were helped by an awesome district manager! I feel terrible because I forgot her name but she was blonde and awesome! If you go you'll def know who she is. It was so much fun choosing our pizza toppings and it was so easy. Their healthier than regular pizza places as well which is another great thing about pizza rev! I highly suggest it to anyone who loves pizza but wants less of a guilty pizza. My favorite is the gluten free crust!"}
{"text":"I gave Pizza Rev a second chance and this time my pizza was delicious especially with the white sauce. My pizza was a lot better and not burnt."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMY- double dough is the way to go!   they also have the \"new\" coke machines which make me happy as I want diet caffeine free coke.... I travel to Vegas a lot for work so this is close by and fast!"}
{"text":"Pizza just the way I like it!  My way!!!   Pizza with any toppings for only $7.99 and if u don't like thin crust you can double the dough.  Add the right amount of sauce and cheese to your taste.  I took a thin crust with 6 toppings in fear, thinking it would hurt the dough but it held together perfectly (guilt free). Perfect pair 4pm to 6pm and 8:30pm to close you can have  a beer and a pizza for $10. Wooohooo!!!"}
{"text":"Have been wanted to try this place out for a while! It looked so innovative! After trying it for the first time last week, my husband and I will definitely be back! It reminds me of subway but for pizza! They have some classic pizzas but mostly, you pick your dough, sauce, cheese, veggies, and meats! It is geared towards someone who wants to be healthy but they have some \"regular/normal\" options."}
{"text":"I have tried Pieology and Pizza Pizza Rev vegetarian pesto sauce pizza. Out of both pizzas the Pieology pizza took the prize. But I do recommend both locations. Great Pizza and great service."}
{"text":"So excited to try. The concept is great. Prices are great also. Love the $10 pizza with beer combo. Unfortunately my pizza was baked in a filthy oven. My pizza was soggy and has all burnt leftover from previous pizza. When i told the cashier, she just explain to me as if that's a normal thing... no apology no nothing. Uggh, i guess paying for a dirty pizza is an ok standard..."}
{"text":"They have this great deal, for less than 10 dollars, you can get a beer & a pizza! & on top of that, unlike other pizza places..  it's unlimited toppings.  That's thin crust was yummy, cause it wasn't too filling BUT you have a choice on what kind of crust to get ;) overall a great place. & staff were so nice & friendly."}
{"text":"Had a great experience tonight we came in about 40 mins to close and the staff took their time explaining everything to us including the tap wall that has beer and wine. The pizza was delicious I got a Margherita with added pepperoni and my husband did a make your own. My daughter got the kids meal pepperoni pizza with a juice and Oreos. We also got a house side salad and a Caesar we were extremely satisfied with our options! We will definitely be back again. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"Holy Crap!!! The sauce here is perfect! The choices are good for topping and the crust is good size. They have a great deal for 10 bucks during happy hour. Pizza and beer. Now that's a perfect match. If your near Stephanie and Sunset, go to PizzaRev."}
{"text":"Pizza craving been here couple of times and it's always good fast and not pricey. I order double doug and of course you need to make your own toppings was good and had Heineken to push my pizza.Reason for the three star is this snaughty cashier I'm guessing she's having bad day other than that it's nice place for quick pizza fix."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Las Vegas. Every time I go in the staff is amazing."}
{"text":"Mediocre product Staff was friendly and rude The worker that started asked my name and if I spelled it a certain way and then spelled it wrong as he winked at me. The rest of the staff guided me through and added any toppings or more of a certain topping as requested.   We took 2 Togo  1 thin 1 Double  Both were over cooked and burnt. I didn't care for the sauce, thick, bland and very forward tomato paste flavor.  With so many other choices I will not go back and suggest avoiding."}
{"text":"This is the second location for Pizza Rev that I visited. I was sent a birthday coupon which prompted my visit to this location, and I am really glad that I did.   The experience here versus the other location that I visited was like night  and day.   I visited today for lunch and while the line was quite long, it moved really quickly. As I moved through, building my own pizza, each person who helped me was super friendly. When I went to pay I had no problem using my free birthday pizza coupon.   The pizza was tasty. I love that you customize the pizza to your liking. Little sauce and light cheese for me, followed by pretty much every veggie.   Two different Pizza Rev associates came around while we were eating to check on us and make sure everything was good.   Thanks for the awesome service and great pizza. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food here is amazing! There's lots of options and the prices are affordable. What brings me here the most though is the friendliness and welcoming atmosphere this place brings. The assistant manager, Brandon, is awesome and makes you feel right at home. This is a great place for family and friends to enjoy some great food!"}
{"text":"Today I ate at pizza rev. I've been here before and I love it because when the husband and I are both craving pizza we usually want different toppings but when we come here we can both get whatever we want!   Today I was especially impressed. The staff was super friendly and welcoming upon arrival and they got our pizza out in a timely fashion. I don't know the names of the staff that were working today but while we were dining I noticed a woman outside struggling to help another woman with a knee brace into the store. It was clear they were having a very difficult time making it from the car into pizza rev. Upon seeing this struggle, a few of the staff members ran out to help and literally helped walk the woman in by holding her up and supporting her. They sat her down at a table and then brought her a menu so that she wouldn't have to go through the line and told her they would bring the pizza out to her.   I was genuinely impressed by their willingness to help not only their customers but also just a woman in need. It always helps to restore faith in humanity when you see such caring and respectful young men stepping up. I will definitely be coming back! Thank you pizza rev for the pizza and the touching moment!"}
{"text":"Dear management, your entire staff needs help with professionalism and customer service. I had a question about the salad sizes or if there was multiple sizes and the older red head woman was very snotty regarding my question and let me know there is only one size.    The next employee I had a problem with was the very very tall gentleman with long dark hair. He was working to the right of the woman taking the orders. He asked me if I wanted any Parmesan cheese on my salad and I asked for a little bit. He was also very snotty and picked up the tiniest pinch of cheese and just threw it on my salad. Not amused kid.  Everyone else in the line was just screaming and making annoying whale-moaning sounds every time someone would walk in. A simple welcome in or welcome to pizza rev would have sufficed.  There is a tiny bar section where employees eat pizza on their breaks I assume. But they continue to yell out order names while they eat their pizzas. Just let them take their break!!  The ONLY saving grace this shop has is an employee named Micah. Very sweet guy working the dining area offered to get us boxes and tidy up our table. A+ customer service from him!  Pizza was meh at best and atmosphere is like recess in a middle school. Drive the extra 15 minutes to Pieology in Downtown Summerlin. I'm never disappointed there."}
{"text":"Ever since I transitioned from Vegetarian to Vegan I've been looking for good pizza! A friend of mine told me about pizza rev and I've been addicted ever since! They have a choice of gluten free allergy or gluten free preference crust. I'm not allergic to gluten but I prefer the gluten free allergy. They have daiya soy free mozzarella cheese, vegan sausage and a wide variety of veggies to choose from. And then there's the topping sauces!!! Omg the Peach Vadalia sauce is a must have! People love it so much, the restaurant runs out so if you try it and love it, I suggest you buy your own bottle lol."}
{"text":"Perfect! Thin crispy dough, plethora of ingredients all for an affordable price! Deliciosa!!!"}
{"text":"Will never return! It shouldn't take 20 minutes to wait in line just to order!!! Ridiculous! The line took so long we just left! So many screaming kids. Adults without children should just avoid this place all together. And by the way, please tell the employees people DO NOT like to be called \"boss\". Completely unacceptable to talk to customers like that.  Blaze pizza has perfected this concept. PizzaRev doesn't win, place or show. Overall horrible experience."}
{"text":"Okay but Blaze pizza across the street is much better. Their pizza is small and you have to nag them to put on extra stuff and then when they do, it's like only a teaspoon so it gets annoying can you add more, can you add more, can you add more until they get it right. It's like they ration the sausage. Blaze is much larger and more choices of toppings so adios pizza rev    Step up your game and I might be back if you can do it like Blaze"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing!! The two men who prepared our pizzas were so kind and helpful,  since it was our first time visiting. They gave us great recommendations for our pizza. Although the place was pretty cold, we had a great time watching sports and enjoying our meal."}
{"text":"Took 20 mins just to order and pay, another 7 minutes to get my pizza out the oven. I'm not exaggerating on the time. I was watching the clock when I was standing by the wall not moving for 5 minutes. If your looking for fast service this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped by for a fundraiser. The pizza was decent. You can choose from a list of pizzas or get creative as you go. Have vegan and gluten free options available."}
{"text":"This PizzaRev is especially special because of the taproom.  They give you a wristband that you put on and place it over the drink that you want and it pours right out.  As for the food, you can choose to build your own pizza or choose one on their already made menu.  What I really like about this place is that they have a variety of cheeses including Ricotta cheese (my favorite for pizza) & they even have Daiya for all the Vegans out there!  They have a line of different meats, toppings, & sauces if you decide to build your own.  After you have your pizza set they throw it in a open fired oven to cook.  They also have salads if you decide you want to go the healthier route.  I've tried the chicken Cesar salad which is really good mainly because the chicken isn't just cubed defrosted chicken, it's actual chicken that's been chopped up!"}
{"text":"Came in with my boyfriend and the kiddos for a quick bite. He suggested Pizza and I was all game! The manager Brandon was very hospitable and made sure every guest was satisfied. I totally love when they step out of their office and check on their patrons. The food is amazing, and they have gluten free & vegan cheese options.   Super close to my house and major shopping centers."}
{"text":"Another custom pizza place. They gave u very little toppings despite asking them for more. Double dough is not like other chains with thick crust.   Not worth the money. Will try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Kunisha at Pizza Rev Rancho Dr. made the most fantastic pizzas for us!  Just the right amount of each ingredient piled just the way we like it.  All the staff there was pleasant  and courteous.  It was a nice experience and the food was great.  We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Went to pizza rev last night with my co workers and had the best experience! The pizza was wonderful, and the employees working were friendly, and enthusiastic. If you want to go to a pizza joint with a variety of beer choices, and great vibes, I recommend pizza rev at the Rancho location!"}
{"text":"The food here was okay nothing fancy or special and about 3 to 3.5 stars for me. However, the 2 stars came from the workers. They weren't rude or anything just slow. The biggest issue that bothered me was when I saw the cashier refilling the bottles of wine. The place had the fancy dispenser for wines that caught my attention. Next thing I know Pamela, the cashier, touched the straw that goes inside the bottle with her bare hands without washing her hands or putting on gloves. She changed 3 wine bottles and did exactly the same thing. It was pretty disgusting. I know for sure that I will never order a glass of wine at this place."}
{"text":"They can do better. The build your own pizza craze has seen several of these types of places pop up around town. While not bad I've had much better crust and toppings at other comparable chains. The wait time was fine but my pizza was burned in a couple of places and the base sauce was just not very flavorful. I doubt I'll repeat the experience."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in the door I was impressed. The staff is super dope and knowledgeable. Now the pizza!!!  Man from the flavor of the sauce and the crisp but still soft crust, is pure perfection. The flavor of the toppings and how the veggies are chopped to get flavor in every bite, who could ask for more. Now the the beer wall made me fall deep in love. You can taste or buy full cups of beer by the ounce. Awesome concept to appeal to a beer lover. Go here !!!"}
{"text":"It was not what we thought it was going to be. Very very thin crust. Thinner than a cracker. Very cheap on the toppings. Asked for extra toppings and it was a piece here and there. No one in the restaurant and it was dirty. The female behind the counter was on her phone the whole time we were there. All in not going back. Oh and the salad all you can have on the salad was tomato and carrots. I can't eat either so I asked for the cheese and eggs. The cheese was only a few pieces. The dressing was an little tiny cup. Had to ask for more. Never again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I choose what I want on my pizza and it perfect every time. Micah was awesome! Great customer service by the staff. Week be back, real soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Make your own pizza or salad. Get whatever toppings you want with seasonal selections This place runs very smoothly, blaze could learn from these guys. They have double dough for a slightly thicker crust. The have beer and I believe a special with it."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing concoction of hand crafted deliciousness and personal preferences. If you want certain things on a pizza they will lay your ingredients on a thin crust pizza baked and made after you finish the decision making from a variety of meats, cheeses, sauces, and vegetables to savor for your appetite."}
{"text":"My experience here was fantastic, brandon was great! he made sure my experience was fantastic and recommended food items to me. I tried the dessert pizza and loved it! he is awesome!"}
{"text":"The whole experience was just average. You had friendly people working, people that didn't smile or make eye contact and those that were just kind of there. The atmosphere is average. Nothing exciting. They don't bring the pizza out to you. Again just average.  As for the pizza, average. It is not very good. The dough tastes like frozen pizza dough. The sauce tastes canned and the cheese tastes processed. I think Pieology is better and The Pizza Kitchen is even better. The ingredients at those two places are fresher and the dough and sauce taste homemade.   I really had high hopes for Pizza Rev opening in the area but the whole fire baked flavor just isn't' there. The pizza got cold very fast and could use an extra 20 sec.   I think the management needs to work on the staff and their knowledge of the product and customer service skills.  I think they also need to figure out how to make fresh dough and sauce. There is a lot of competition in this market and they will sink quickly.   I wasn't surprised to only see 3.5 stars after opening."}
{"text":"Fun place to go have an individual pizza and some good beer.  The double dough is a must for me. Price isn't bad. Staff was very nice. The best part is the tap wall. You get a wristband connected to your account. Put the wristband up to the tap and pour as much as you want. You get charged by the ounce. So if you only want half a glass, you only get charged for half a glass. Great way to taste different beer without having to buy many full glasses. I will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"Omg I love this place! So much better than Pieology.  It's the same concept as subway only with pizza. I love their crust and their cheeses were amazing. You can add any meat you want at no extra cost the only thing that cost more is the gluten-free crust. I made an Italian pizza and it was heaven. All of the workers were super helpful and very friendly and professional. I will definitely be back because it is so close in my area and I recommend it to all of my friends."}
{"text":"4 stars for the pizza! Would have given them 5 but Management is lacking a bit...the line moves much slower than it should have do to poor management but hey everyone has off days.  I will most def be a regular customer as long as they continue to offer vegan cheese and vegan sausage!!! (If they ever decide to offer vegan pepperoni ill be in heaven!) much better than some other vegan pizzas i have tried."}
{"text":"When we entered there was debris in the cheese (photo uploaded). We approached the front and the guy shares, \"we are out of boxes so you cannot order take out.\" No hello, no greeting, my first experience starts with an abrupt sharing of what I cannot be provided.    While in line the server had an attitude. Midway through our sauce order he proclaims, \"I have to greet other people for food and walks away.\" We stand there a little bewildered and embarrassed. Another guy comes after 2 minutes. I asked for extra pep, he put on a few slices, and was annoyed when I asked for more. I asked for spicy pep, he did not add any, then asks, \"you all done?\"   In addition to being out of boxes and out positive customer service, they were out of Parmesan cheese and romaine lettuce for the Caesar. Food was decent. The experience leading up to it was visceral. If you want McDonald's quality customer service, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"I give Pizza Rev my first 5-star for many reasons. First I'd like to talk about the promotion for free pizza on Sunday night. I saw the sponsored ad on Instagram and I immediately was hooked. Who can pass up a whole 11\" pizza, I know I can't.   The promotion was from 5-10pm Sunday night. My gf and I arrived around 7:30, and there was a like out the door and around the corner. The line stayed that way until 10pm. They had 2 employees checking to see if you liked or followed them on Facebook or Instagram. They gave us a slip to checkout for FREE. The design reminded me of a Chipotle style, where you pick your toppings as you move down towards the register.  The employees were on point the whole time. I was impressed that they kept a smile as well. They have a great selection of toppings with healthy organic options as well as gluten free crust. I ordered a pepperoni, fennel sausage, and ricotta cheese pizza. It was delicious! The crust was thin which made it not too filling.   Overall I'd have to say I was extremely impressed with this place and their promotions. I will definitely be back for some more PIZZA!   P.S. We also have a Facebook (Pets.Pizza) and Instagram (@Pets.Pizza) that we created. We bring the best of both Pets and Pizza together :) Check us out!"}
{"text":"Inexperienced staff. Weird setup, beer taps and a room no one in Vegas would want to hang out in. It's like going to a fast food place to just hang out. Spend the money on real wood decor, brick and comfortable booths. I live close and would drive further away to get a beer. Ambiance kind of sucks. Stick to what your good at, slinging fast food pizzas, or up your game."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this restaurant \"customize your own pizza from the choice of dough all the way up to the toppings\". Gluten and vegetation friendly. Also has a bar with beer on draught and wine by the glass. The pizza I got was vegetarian with spinach, jalepenos, tomatoes, oregano and some ranch. It was fantastic quality pizza. Did not deserve more stars due to staff appearance and restaurant cleanliness."}
{"text":"I Love PIZAAA!!! so for me Pizza Rev is heaven.. long overdue reviews because I feel like I stop by at least 2x a week ..eeek. This location has the best Staff!! they are very friendly and courteous to all their customers :). The place is clean and and they stock up on their condiments. My pizza always comes out perfect and lots of selection on their ingredients. lets just say I saw beets, HB eggs and anchovies as a choice lol.. well can't judge people but glad they accommodate those who likes variety on their pizza lol"}
{"text":"\"I like it like that...\"  Can't go wrong with a create your own! Stopped by this afternoon to satisfy my Alfredo sauce craving. The service is quick and the staff was extremely polite! My vegetarian pizza with fresh mushrooms and ricotta hit the spot for a generous $7.99.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ummmmmm is this Pizza Rev or Cici's Pizza ??  Soo much sauce!!! Cheese didn't even make it up to the crust.  Defiantly not what we expected. Gave it and extra star cause the crust is better than Blaze. Maybe because we ordered to pick up, unsure if I would give this place another try"}
{"text":"Just another Pizza place, well at least that's what I thought. I've passed by this place so many times but never tried it. Well the family and I decided to pay Pizza Rev a visit and to my surprise the Pizza turned to be better than what I expected.  I like the fact that you are able to build your own pizza, and choose every single ingredient even down to the crust. At first I thought that the pizza looked a bit small to fill an adult but after all the toppings were put on and the pizza baked, it actually turned out to be very filling. I ordered the classic pizza and added olives and mushrooms, the taste was really fresh and the pizza overall had really good flavor.   I was making plans to maybe order another pizza since I thought it wasn't going to fill me up but I have to say that I was really surprised, not only did it fill me up but I was rather full for a while since it was really filling. Over all I have to give this place a 4 star rating, and most likely will be back in the future."}
{"text":"The pizza was very yummy. I was disappointed that they only allow juice or milk with the kids meal. Let's face it, soda is great with pizza. Well they charged me a $1 for the upcharge to a foundation drink per kid, but their fountain was out of carbonation!!! So they upcharge and didn't provide. To say the least my first visit there may be my last. But like I said the pizzas was pretty good."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! You choose what you want and they make it for you right there. They also have amazing cookies and even better service!"}
{"text":"This pizzarev... I'm speechless! Workers here so so so so nice and friendly. My friends and I made a quick stop before heading to our hotel for the day and it was so worth it. The people working there are interactive with you, make sure all your needs are met and actually try to have a conversation with you. I also have to say that we were very impressed with Ray and his customer service. He went above and beyond to make sure that we were having a good time and a safe weekend. I've never felt so welcomed at a pizza joint. Keep up the good work and great customer service - it's whats going to make us keep coming back"}
{"text":"Gluten free crust is amazing!!  The Manager Brandon gave us phenomenal service  It's a must!!!"}
{"text":"The price is okay but pizzas lack flavor. My family and I have made several visits and never found a clean table to sit. Very poor housekeeping. If the dining room area is unkept, I can imagine what other areas look like."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Mainly because of the poor customer service but the food wasn't great either. The cleanliness of this place is disgusting and I knew I should've just walked out. It wanted to try it though. They don't change gloves in between making different pizzas. I don't eat pork and watched them touch all the pepperoni pizzas ahead of mine and then make my chicken pizza. I let it slide. The guy at the beginning of the line asked me what kind of sauce I wanted as he knocked over a can into the red sauce. Threw the can away but didn't change the sauce! The health department needs to be called on this place! I got the BBQ chicken pizza with thin crust. It is so bland and tasteless. The BBQ sauce on the pizza was the best part. It's super thin crust and still wasn't cut in even sizes. I had 4 smaller uneven slices and then two large slices. The side Caesar salad is over priced for it to be so small. The lettuce leaves were wilted and the dressing is not tasty. I ordered my food to-go and the guy who called my name out gave me my pizza. My salad was on the counter and I said this is mine too. He asked me if I was sure as if I was actually trying to take an unpaid for salad. I said yes do you need to see my receipt? He said yes and proceeded to hold up my receipt in the light like he was trying to check to see if a $100 bill is authentic or not. I have never been so embarrassed especially when I know I paid for all of my items!!!! I will never spend another dollar in that establishment as long as they're offering that kind of customer service!"}
{"text":"Stopped by with a friend at a little after 5PM on a recent Thursday.  Our order-taker was a thoroughly *disinterested* female named something like \"Tanisha,\" but thankfully, the ordeal of interacting with her was brief, and we moved-on to a pleasant employee who finalized our pizzas, and the rest of our experience was OK.    The restaurant was clean, never got busy during the almost 2 hours we were there.  The pizzas were good, and I especially like the self-serve drink machine that lets you whip-up all sorts of concoctions.  BUT...  For being a place that specializes in pizzas, they had relatively very few toppings, styles, etc. available. As a new customer not totally familiar with the options, for the sake of expediency, I asked dear \"Tanisha\" for a \"regular crust.\"  Somehow in her world, that meant I got a \"Signature Thin\" crust pizza.  That & a self-serve fountain drink (free refills) added up to $10.80.  The pizza, while good, wasn't very filling for a dinner, & as soon as I was out the door around 7PM, I was trying to figure out where else to get food.  Maybe a decent place for a quick lunch, but I'll only be back if a friend insists on going there.    There are so many other pizza places that are a better value for the price."}
{"text":"So this place has probably the best Crust out of these types of fast service pizza places for sure. Double Dough is the way to go. I only recommend the thin crust if your not loading too many heavy toppings on your pizza.  The service here was great, thought the line process in this store seems to have some sort of hiccups. Can place my finger on it.  The amazing selection of hot sauces, is also what makes this my go to spot. Great deals with 1.00 pizza's on Tuesdays, and 9.99 pizza and beer all day every day! Recommend downloading the app and getting a free pizza! It takes 12 or so hours for the coupon to go through, but hey you earn points for more free pizza! Can't beat that!  I would recommend coming in here during it's slower times. After rush lunch or right before dinner. Also open late so good go to!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Fresh and unique ingredients such as cilantro and vegetarian sausage.  You get unlimited toppings and made to order pizza.   The pizza is cooked in a brick oven and is so delicious!   You can choose from several different cheeses and sauces.   Would highly recommend for picky eaters."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my pizza I created, the unlimited toppings are so good! However, I wish they would cut the pizza into somewhat equal sizes. Overall rating 5+ cool atmosphere, good service. I would recommend this place to check out if you love pizza."}
{"text":"The people who work here are always nice and the toppings are always great....but my problem starts where the pizza starts and that's the dough. Their dough is so bland and flavorless but add in the fact that it is pressed flat with just canned anti-stick oil? That just makes it taste processed. And since the dough is the first thing that hits your tongue, it doesn't matter how good the toppings are or how friendly the people are. Sorry :/"}
{"text":"Disappointed with today's Pizza Rev visit, pizza is delicious as usual, service is really bad today!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing. The workers were extra helpful. The food was great!! Brandon was amazing."}
{"text":"I love pizzarev so much! Me and my friend come here regularly for our pizza dates and they are so delicious and affordable. We always get the pizza and beer combo for $9.95. Such a great deal!   I love the different toppings that they have to choose from. They even have delicious vegan cheese that I like to go for.   They have unique toppings like Brussel sprouts, capers, vegan sausage, and just about every other meat or veggie you can think of! Honestly such a good price for how much food you get!"}
{"text":"You MUST ask for Anthony to cook your pizza because he's the best! Hands down the best pizza place I've ever went to! Anthony has amazing customer service and our pizzas came out perfect! I always drive 25 minutes just for Pizza Rev and it's so worth it, they never disappoint me."}
{"text":"They're the bomb.com all the time always make the best pizza in town all day everyday"}
{"text":"The customer service was good and the prices are comparable to other pizza places like this. They also had some good specials on certain days. I like the pizza better at pieology and blaze but I would come back on the day of the specials."}
{"text":"Great place to take the kids for a late lunch.. They get to pick what they want on their pizza and they enjoy eating and finishing it up too!!  Staff was friendly and quick in getting our orders in.. I will be back for sure! Also its nice to know its in my side of town! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza & special on Tuesdays. 1 of the best pizza's I've ever had. Staff is friendly & you can tell this business owner is dedicated to making this a Review-Journal top places to dine in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Great place, fast and good service.  The pizza pictured was delicious. Open fire vs. oven made a difference with crispness of the crust, which I think is important w/thin. The marinara was fresh and outstanding. Something new to me was the beef pepperoni which I appreciated because although I like pepperoni, I TRY to refrain from pork. Price is more than decent 7.99 to be exact for your way, unlimited toppings. Check out the 2 happy hours, very good deal! Good job, keep it up and I'll be sure to come back after church but this time with more hungry people!"}
{"text":"This is a new family favorite! Fresh, delicious ingredients, great prices, build your own pizza with unlimited toppings, several options to include gluten free and reduced fat cheese, friendly employees, plus one of the new Coca-Cola drink machines with several drink options+flavors! Everything I could want in a pizza joint :)"}
{"text":"We've thought the staff was lacking in the past but Carmilla gave us great customer service tonight. She made our pizzas with love. Thank you!"}
{"text":"For an overall review of Pizza Rev check out my 1st review for the location in Spring Valley. This review is geared towards comparison of the two chain locations.   Henderson Pizza Rev is good but not comparable to the one in Spring Valley which is consistent in service and taste every time. (Shoutout to Sal again! You're an example for what great customer service should be!!)  The food wasn't consistent. Ingredients and sauces were fresh & still tasty but the building of the pizzas was different. Spring Valley really takes pride in their jobs. They greet you with smiles and are always happy. Makes me look forward to going there always. The workers at Henderson were so-so which kinda bummed me out. I saw one of them on their phones at the register. I get it, it's slow & you wanna check your FB or twitter... So go in the kitchen. Don't do it in the front of the house. At Spring Valley, in their down time I see employees building pizza boxes, re-filling ingredients or wiping down tables/counters, basically making the best of their time.  If it's a chain restaurant, I expect the standards to be the same at every location. In this case it's not. I plan to visit another Pizza Rev location in the Vegas valley to see which standards are more common between the Spring Valley & Henderson location."}
{"text":"Five star for customer service! It was our first time with family, and it being our first time we were looking for a good deal and good food. Both were met! Everything was super delish! Salad, pizza, and a decadent dessert.. WOW! So awesome. Will definitely come back. I'm typically very picky and because you can get whatever you want on your pizza, no problem for me! Check it out if you've never been here"}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed as the base (cheese, sauce, dough) didn't make for a high quality pizza.   The dough, which I got \"double thick\" on a margherita base was about as thin as a frozen tombstone pizza, with about as much flavor.   The sauce didn't stand out as anything special which is why they offer you a dozen different bottles of hot sauce with which you are supposed to \"rev\" up your pizza.  They have about 40 ingredients to pile on and doctor up the mediocrity. I usually create an un-harmonious mix at these joints because I'll eat anything but this time I used restraint and went with some meat, ricotta and sun-dried tomatoes.   Of the 3 occasions I've hit a new and trendy build your own pizza establishment (Blaze, etc.) this experience was least memorable.   Thank god for the hot sauce."}
{"text":"The thin crust is so thin, like the thickness of a tortilla chip. Recommend the double dough crust. Flavors are good. They mixed up a bunch of pizzas, they need a better tracking system, mine walked away with another customer, she brought it back. I watched it happen again with other pizzas during my lunch."}
{"text":"Totinos is better than this garage. You're better off with delivery. It's not worth what you pay. However it's really fast so you don't wait long for the crappy food."}
{"text":"For this place having vegan pizza you would think the staff would be a little bit more knowledgable about their ingredients. I'm allergic to soy and I am vegan, I stopped in here to ask if they used soy in their vegan pizzas, the girl I spoke with just didn't know what their ingredients where so I asked her if she could ask someone who was more knowledgeable about their ingredients and she left and came back and told me \" they don't tell them that stuff \" what ? Seemed like a really cool place, but giving one star for \" young bad customer service \" & lack of knowledge of menu ingredients"}
{"text":"Staff is amazing and so is the pizza. Price is great. Favorite pizza place in town by far"}
{"text":"I haven't even eaten my pizza yet but this place gets five stars. The level of service and general attitude of Isaiah at the front of the pizza line is enough to make me want to come back. It's great to see a place that puts their talent where it matters. He does great with people, has a great personality, and seems to enjoy his job"}
{"text":"This is my favorite create your own pizza place.  I love the thin crust. Great choice of toppings and sauces.  The employees all have great up beat I can help you attitudes! I've been there 3 times in 2 weeks."}
{"text":"Asked for double dough, got the thinnest dough. If that really was a double dough then I won't be coming back.  No ranch. Come on no ranch? Take your lazy ass to the store across the road."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad. For starters, The toppings are not quality and they're very cheap with their toppings! And their cheese! I made it clear from the beginning that I wanted extra cheese and unfortunately I had to keep asking and feeling like an idiot because they kept only sprinkling a few pieces at a time. I did ask for mushrooms and green pepper and I must say they do not cook the pizza very long in the oven probably because they're afraid to burn it but the vegetables on top of the pizza was raw and the cheese was barely even melted in fact it was almost cold. the pizza had no flavor whatsoever! It was not worth the price. The salad was stale and the cookies were very hard and burnt. There is an amazing place like this on Fort Apache called kitchen pizza or something like that and the pizza is so much better and they are not cheap with their toppings and the customer service there is also much better. The owners must keep the employees deadly scared to splurge on anything extra because they were so cheap they barely even gave me a pizza box to wrap up our leftovers definitely not worth your time. Overpriced! overrated."}
{"text":"Ok, first I almost never give 5 stars.  I'm just so excited to find a pizza place that has Gluten Free crust, not made from corn and it's delicious. I tried this place for the first time today and I will definitely be back.  GF people know how hard it is to get tasty GF food.  I had the sausage and fennel pizza and loved it.  Could have used a bit more sauce, but I'm too excited to have this option.  The service was a little lame, I'm sure it's the best they can do on minimum wage salaries, but who cares, the food is good.  Let's keep them in business!  One observation, GET Wi-Fi in there."}
{"text":"PizzaRev is a great place for a quick pizza. Great price they don't nickel and dime you on toppings. My family has a gluten allergy and the staff is always super careful when preparing our food"}
{"text":"We came here for the $6 Tuesday lunch deal. This is probably the best pizza I've encountered and we've lived in Las Vegas for almost 3 years now. From choosing your crust to picking all the toppings you want, this is absolutely the best value lunch pizza we've found. We also got the Oreo dessert pizza. It was the perfect end to our lunch. The staff was super helpful and friendly as well. If you want a great value pizza that's absolutely delicious you should come here."}
{"text":"Tasty, super fast and friendly staff. Made for a good experience. Thanks to Joshua the manager for heads up service!"}
{"text":"Came in after football practice with our Las Vegas Falcon \"Hitsquad\" family. The staff welcomed us with appreciation for our business. They were friendly and  efficient with our orders and customer service was amazing.. Thank you !!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I love that you can get your pizza exactly how you like it. The staff is always friendly and they accommodate any requests."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.   Environment: The inside is rather open and bright, with an assembly line starting towards the left side of the entrance.   Food: The build-your-own pizza deal is great in that it makes it very easy for everyone to make their pizza exactly the way they like it. Their selections of cheese, sauce, meat, and toppings is nice, and I have always been satisfied with the pizza I have made for myself.  Service: The workers are all nice and personable.  Overall this is one of my favorite places to go on a quick lunch break and has quickly become a regular on my list of lunch spots."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place to compare to some other similar theemed places. One thing they lack is whole wheat dough. I would have thought a place offering Vegan cheese and organtic tomato sauce whould have this.  The pizza was cooked well but lacked flavor.   If you are in the mood for a basic pizza and are in a hurry this would be the place."}
{"text":"This was my first time at PizzaRev and my pizza was \"delicious\". I can't wait to go there again. The place was very clean and the employee where very friendly."}
{"text":"This was my first time at PizzaRev and my pizza was \"delicious\". Can't wait to go back and try another pizza. The place was clean and the employee was friendly."}
{"text":"First time here and it was overall delicious! Place was nice and clean. Several choices of meat and veggies to chose from. They also had 4 types of sauces and 2 types of crust. Staff was nice and helpful. Flavors were good and the fact on Tuesday you can have any and all toppings for $6, is the way to go!  Knocking off two stars because my friends pizza had hair. It seemed as if it was in the dough and not a random flyaway. Nonetheless, that was disgusting!  Hopefully the next time we go there won't be anymore hair in the dough."}
{"text":"Being a New Yorker, this is not pizza. The thin crust is cracker pizza. Passover pizza with matzo is better. Takes too long to order. One guy puts together the pizza. No hospitality here. Had to ask for a plate. No one has any evperience in restaurant operations. Pizzas are one size, tiny. Bleu cheese on a pizza? Nonna's are turning over in their graves. Forget this joint. Grimaldi's is across the street."}
{"text":"Wow! Where to start. Pizza was good, price is right, Stella on Draft, employees real nice and the place was clean. I'm not good with names so I'll just say the Mothers Day Dinner Crew was awesome. I love pizza and look forward to returning. Thank You."}
{"text":"Ordered a custom pizza. The employee ringing me up charged me with a $2.00 drink without asking if I wanted one (i didn't). Then doesn't give me a cup for the drink. I had to go back and ask for a cup. They also pressure you to donate money to organizations that gives you coupons to their location. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"These sort of pizza places are popping up everywhere. The \"Subway\" or \"Chipotle\" of pizza, this place has signature menu items, or you can build it yourself, but either way your pizza creation is built in front of you and placed in an oven where it's ready quicker than you could call for take out.   They have many cheese (including vegan for a buck extra), sauce, and topping options. You can pile on as many toppings as you want. One thing I didn't like, compared to a recently opened competitor (ahem, Blaze), is they don't add salt, pepper, and oregano before your pizza is cooked. It's no big deal, as they have those items available for you before you sit down, but I'd rather they get cooked into the pizza. They also don't offer a spicy sauce option as Blaze does. They have a gluten free crust, available for an extra $2.   The service was good and quick, and the restaurant was clean. The crust was a little too thin for my liking. I built my own but kept it simple as in just a cheese pizza, and it was about two dollars more than the basic cheese pizza option at Blaze.   I like this concept and will have it for lunch now and then, but in the world of \"build your own\" pizza, my money's on Blaze."}
{"text":"When this place first opened - I would've said hands down 5 stars. However over the course of time - and frequent ordering (can't help it - they have decent vegan options) they seem to have severely dropped the enthusiasm. It's Friday night. The one thing that really happens on Friday night when you have kids is a nice treat to a family meal that we don't have to slave in the kitchen for. Especially after a long week at the office.   My issue comes when I order through the app, casually drive from the office to my one last stop for weekend freedom - only to be disappointed by the pure lack of enthusiasm with making my family's dinner. These pizzas looked like something I've seen before. Oh yes, a fine dining experience where a portion is smaller than ideal from the norm - but every single small bite of that delicate portion is amazing flavors causing crescendos of pleasure with every bite.   Pizza Rev I hate to tell you but you are not that. You are a means of satisfaction to the already abused want to have convenience. The pizzas tonight, as well as a 50/50 amount of past experiences, grants you a solid two stars and I truly feel dissatisfied as a customer. Scattered and scarce toppings, about 3/4 inches of crust (this is very upsetting) and lack of pride from the staff. It's truly that apparent.   Lastly, and I say this last because in the flow of your service line this is something very often overlooked at the end of the cycle. Nearly every visit the finishing sauce and arugula are not included when ordered. Nearly every time. This is a break in your chain and it negatively affects customer experience.   Future visitors of this establishment; expect a blend of 50/50 good to bad experiences and the rare stellar performance from this location."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to a lot pizza places, we like to try different ones out. This is definitely not one to try! Pizza is mediocre at best. Place looks nice, staff is nice too. But ultimately, I'm there for the food and it just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Whoa. Best pizza I've had in a while! I bring the family down for $6 Tuesday's and we love crafting our own pies. This week I tried the white sauce, had bacon, chicken, roasted garlic, cilantro (which I could have used more of), arugula and mushrooms (again, more please), feta, spinach and topped with basil pesto. My husband started with the Mediterranean and customized it from there. Things I wish I could do? Be able to start with basil pesto, add eggplant, green olives."}
{"text":"Great, I'm too busy enjoying my pizza to write a longer review. The customer service was good the pizza was incredible of course I \"made\" the pizza with great and fresh ingredients, definitely coming back. FYI I made the pizza with BBQ and red hot sauce on the bottom, yes you can do that. If you get the chance try it."}
{"text":"Build your pizza, pour your beer and choose your music. Yeah, customize your experience.  People here are very friendly. They gave my little one apple sauce and walked me through the their beer garden. They even gave me another fresh cold glass after the second pour. The pizza dough is a bit thin but that's your traditional New York pizza. Needless to say I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Very clean and fast service. $6 Tuesday pizza are the days to go for the thin crust pizza deal. Not the best but gets the point across. I always ask them to make my pizza a little well done. They do sell draft beers, and beers are my friend. You can get the double dough which cost a little bit more. Lots of fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Brandon (the manager) exceptionally personal and very concerned that all of our pizzas be exactly the way we wanted. And they came out perfect and delicious. The thin crust is really delicious giving you the pizza experience without feeling heavy fullness of typical pizza dough. Highly recommend if you have not tried. Also lots of unique toppings and very health-conscious choices."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great custom pizzas! Self serve beer is cool as well, and they have a decent selection!"}
{"text":"Come eat here or be dissatisfied all day.. I eat here often and for good reason. Come join the family and REV it up"}
{"text":"PizzaRev is the ultimate quick pizza shop in Vegas. The staff is incredible, the food is amazing, and the wait is near non-existent. Carlos the manager is the man! The location is great as well. Would recommend to any and all pizza lovers, and if youre not a pizza lover yet, pizzaRev will turn you into one!"}
{"text":"Our homeschool group had a field trip here. The staff was fantastic, always smiling and very patient with the kids. They have wonderful customer service. The pizza was delicious and the facility was very clean.  Thank you Brandon and staff!"}
{"text":"So good and so reasonably priced! You can either choose to make your own pizza or order one of their own design. I made my own. I believe it was $8 for my pizza, and I ordered the vegan cheese since I cannot have dairy. The line moved fast and the employees were kind. My pizza did come out a little burned, but I was too hungry to mind. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You can make your own fire pizza with great ingredients however the best thing about this place is all the hot sauces they have. Whether you want some spice in your life or want to burn in hell they got that for you."}
{"text":"We came about a week or two after they opened and had about a fifteen minute wait from the time we got in line until we received our pizzas. I'm sure those times have gone down as it most likely less busy and the crew has become more efficient.  I had the red sauce, their Italian cheese, and about 4 or 5 other toppings on my pizza. You can choose from the selection of their own pizzas also if you're indecisive. I liked the red sauce and the crust was thin and crispy. It's hard not to like a custom made pizza right out of the oven. I finished it pretty easily and one was enough for my daughter to share with her friend.  For beverages, there is Coke Freestyle machine and some beer and wine for the adults if they choose.  There's no direct entrance to the front of the restaurant from Sunset or Stephanie. You have to come around from the back (that's what she said)  ; -)  $8/pizza is a fair price, but if you're looking to feed four or five people like I usually have to, one large or extra large pizza from somewhere else may be more economical, but you won't have the customization obviously. I would ideally come back to quickly scarf down a pie if I was pressed for time during lunch."}
{"text":"Only at Pizza rev can one get Apple juice in a wine goblet courtesy of Carlos aka El Jefe.  Awesome place just keep your expectations realistic. It's no revolutionary pizza, but it does good with its Chipotle pointing style. Swag."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It is so hard for my son to eat out with all his allergies. His allergic to dairy, eggs, soy, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish. He is able to enjoy a pizza here...and it's awesome! They have dedicated employees who are trained in cross contamination."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Very thin crust, crisp and perfect texture. Very tasty fresh ingredients and toppings. The sauces are flavorful and the pizza is topped with authentic extra virgin olive oil. All for 8 or 9 bucks?! Settabello's is overrated, this pizza totally compares if not better for half the price. Build your own pizza and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad if you just want a quick meal that is not too expensive. You can make your own pizza here starting with the dough (thin or thick), the sauce, the vegetables, and then the meat. A pizza and drink averages out to $10. A couple of things I really didn't like was how the thick crust wasn't thick at all, and how they cheated me out on their toppings so I had to ask for extra for almost all their toppings!"}
{"text":"Loved the sauces and the double dough pizza. Great prices! They usually have specials on Tuesdays ;)"}
{"text":"Pizza Rev just opened this is a beef roni, chicken, spinach, olives & italian cheeze... On point but have them cook it xtra!  NOT IMPRESSED!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. You pick the toppings so you only have yourself to blame if things go south :)  I opt for the olive oil and garlic base instead of traditional red sauce. It's delicious. The pizza rev on Sahara has a beer/wine wall where you pay by the ounce. The beer system is a little clunky as you have to go to a different line, trade your ID for a bracelet which calculates your ounces and then you bring the bracelet back to get your ID and then pay for the beer."}
{"text":"It says a lot about a place where their employees are eating Zuppa's right in front of all the customers eating Pizza Rev. Hmmmm..."}
{"text":"This was my first time going there and I absolutely loved the pizza and the food. I had their regular pizza, organic tomato sauce, mozzarella with spinach, mushroom, pepperoni and sausage. Their service was as good as their food and it was immaculate. Tasty and fast yet doesn't skimp on presentation! Isaiah or Niah Alex and the rest of the crew where amazing as their were professional. They are the best!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza & the staff... Always so friendly. Nice & clean too even though they were busy since its $6 pizza day!! Awesome deal! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to to satisfy my pizza craving! They have regular dough, which comes in a very thin crust or double dough (which is still thin after its cooked), and gluten free dough that comes in one size. There are many different options for sauces, cheeses, meats, and vegetables. If there's a long line, I would recommend grabbing a menu by the door so you can browse over the options and choose what you want. I recommend going on Tuesdays for $6 custom pizzas! I also recommend downloading the PizzaRev app. You get a reward for signing up, which is a free pizza or entree salad. You will also get one point for each dollar you spend, and it'll count towards another free meal!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend PizzaRev, you won't be disappointed. Only 7.99 for whatever toppings you want.. You can't beat that. The staff was very friendly and very clean environment.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Had to check this place out and me and friend stop by there to check out there pizza. It was 6.99 if I remember for anything you want on your Pizza and it is cooked in like 2 minutes. The pizza was pretty good I will be going back there. The service was quick and happy workers."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok. Pretty flavorless despite getting spicy everything, still had to dump pounds of crushed red pepper on it. I would eat it again but the line moved so slow. There were 7 people in front of my and it took 30 mins to get through. Service was not friendly no smiles. And the cookie was burnt."}
{"text":"This is a great place for pizza! They have lots of options for dough, sauces, and toppings. You can create your own or go with one of their Our Way Pizzas. I noticed a Monday Meal Deal and a Perfect Pair special-  $9.95 for a pizza and beer daily 4-6 pm and after 8:30 pm. They have beer, wine, including local Tenaya Creek! Friendly staff, clean restaurant!"}
{"text":"Yum yum and yum. Tuesday you get a pizza with all the topping you want for only $6. Personal - about 12 inches. Ingredients are fresh, and abundant. Gluten free crust for those of you that need that. Delicious!  This may be a new Tuesday hang out!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what the hype about this place is. The pizza is super greasy and tasteless. Not even the kids liked it."}
{"text":"This place is always a favorite.  Always fresh ingredients and no matter 1 topping or all of them it's the same great price.  Added plus Tuesday's is $6 pizzas.  Over all foods good so is the staff and service."}
{"text":"I eat at this PizzaRev about twice a week with co-workers and friends and we love this place.  The staff is friendly and Julian always provides amazing customer service.  There's a lot to choose from for toppings.  The pizzas are 11\" with thin or double dough crust and options for special diet needs... so as long as they like pizza, i can take anyone there!"}
{"text":"Five stars for some of the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas.  I got the Mediterranean pizza and it was fantastic!! The kids deal is a small heart shaped pizza, a drink and a snack; we got chocolate milk and Oreo cookies.  You get get a variety of kid drinks; juice, milk or fountain drink.  You can also get either apple sauce or Oreos.    The drink machine is pretty freaking cool too(picture).  The staff is friendly and helpful. It was a little Loud in there with all the noise of customers, employees and the loud music. So when they call your name you can't hear (at all).   I only gave four stars, because It was kind of dirty. Tables were dirty, floors were dirty, behind counters dirty and the drink machine was dirty.   There's a self serve beer bar, which is mighty awesome. Next time I come in I'll have to try it.   The wait time is average to about anywhere else and there's only one toilet in the bathrooms.  So waiting to wash hands or go potty is a pain. Why don't all restaurants have hand washing stations out like PDQ and Newks?  Sometimes I just need to wash hands. Something to think about!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first \"unlimited toppings\" pizza place I've been to. With that being said I am also not a huge fan of a ton of toppings on my pizza.   Even though I may not get the most \"bang for your buck\" at restaurants that offer unlimited toppings my husband is a huge fan of unlimited toppings so we decided to give Pizza Rev a try.   You have the option to choose thin, thick or gluten free crust. I ordered the thin crust but next time I would absolutely get the think crust which my husband ordered. I went a little out of my normal pizza toppings because I was so overwhelmed by choice.   The pizza I made was screaming for salt. Their red sauce is okay. Next time I would ask for light sauce and add bacon or feta for a little extra salt kick.   For the price and the location I am sure we will be back and I will give another sauce a try to see if it helps make a difference with the amount of salt the pizza needed."}
{"text":"Came to try out the new pizza place. I had the double dough pizza for $7.99 which I thought was a great deal. Line moved pretty fast and customer service was good. We decided to eat at the small bar they had there and order a drink. They had a special for a pizza and beer for $10. That was awesome. So basically 2 more dollars and you get a beer? Why not. They had 4 beers on tap. I had a Stella. Overall I was pretty satisfied with this place. They also have a big TV for sports events which I thought was cool."}
{"text":"I had the rev 'd up pizza and let me say it was bomb .. the staff member Micah asked what my favorite items were and suggested the rev'd he sure knows how to pick the best pizza for you ."}
{"text":"Horrible, I guess it doesn't help that I'm from New York. Got a margarita pie to go, took it home could not even finish a piece of it. It is in the garbage. The staff could not get my name right and the cashier was hitting on me. What a disgrace"}
{"text":"I absolutely miss having pizzas because as a vegan I don't normally get to eat when friends choose to go out for pizza.  I am happy to report Pizza Rev has changed the game for us Vegans.  I absolutely Love the vegan meat and daiya cheese.  I used to be a pizza maker back in high school when the ingredients were nothing like they are today. Before a pizza held absolutely no nutritional value whatsoever, but now I can eat one at Pizza Rev and get all the veggies I love!!!!  Plus the pricing is decent for the value of the ingredients and quality of food."}
{"text":"Looking for something new and different, try Pizza Rev! You create your own personal pizza with unlimited toppings! If you have a gluten allergy they do a great job in providing pizza, gluten free. They have a system including changing gloves to prevent cross contamination. We love coming here because everyone gets what they want custom made pizza. They are quick and efficient so you don't have to wait long, check it out today!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't accept the Pizza Rev coupon that I just received in the mail. We live 2 blocks away and were excited to check them out, so when we received the coupon to try a salad or pizza for free, we were in. We were informed that the coupon was not valid on Tuesdays because they offer $2 off on Tuesdays.... I pointed out that this qualifier was not printed on the coupon and received a shrug. We felt scammed by the bait & switch tactic and ate elsewhere. They must not need the $$$ of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to a build your own pizza, you'll know exactly what to expect. If you haven't, you pick the sauce, veggies, and meat. All the ingredients have always been fresh and considering you made the pizza its made just how you like!  There is a beer area that I haven't tried but have heard it is pretty good. Seeing it in action looked like a fun experience too. My only complaint is the ranch taste less like ranch and more like a caesars dressing.  Overall a fun and tasty pizza joint bound to please pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Pizza is not that great (not a fan of the marinara sauce they use), service not good, and the place was dirty. There wasn't many people when I visited during my lunch break, yet the tables were dirty. This was my first time here, and I had questions but staff just seemed annoyed with my questions. Only thing that's great about this place is how fast it takes to make the personal sized pizza, and the vegetarian/vegan options. But honestly I wouldn't be coming back."}
{"text":"Loved our first visit to Pizza Rev Taproom!!! The pizza was awesome and the beer tapp wall was great!!!! Kiambi was so great! He really took care of us!"}
{"text":"I can't eat here. I was looking at the way they prepared the food and it's all cross contaminated. Unfortunately I'm allergic to pineapples so when the person in front of me ordered it I realized they do not change gloves between toppings which means I can still become sick. Oh well"}
{"text":"Subway goes pizza. Pick your toppings and thickness of dough. Thomas was our Pizza Master,  and he did it up right!  There also happens to be a wall of 'pour your own' draft beer. Unique concept!!!!  Coming back."}
{"text":"I love the concept of these sort of pizza places.  I also really appreciate that they have gluten free and vegan options for those of us who have a restricted diet.  The pizza itself was tasty.  Nothing too crazy to write home about but also not bad.  Definitely good as a mid week dinner meal.  The service was good if not a little slow.    The one thing that I would have really liked better was if the toppings were a little less messy.  It's kind of unappealing when it's not clean."}
{"text":"There's an important saying: \"You can't buy happiness, but you can buy pizza... which is kind of the same thing.\"  Unfortunately for this place, it did not live up to that \"pizza happiness.\"  If you've ever been to Pieology, it's very similar. If you've never been to Pieology, then it's very similar to how Chipotle runs.. and if you've never been to Chipotle... well then I don't know what to tell you.  Anyways, you have basically 3 options from the menu. You can: 1) make your own with unlimited toppings 2) select a cheese pizza or 3) choose one of their pre-selected pizzas.  I went with my fiancé and of course we chose the unlimited toppings! I don't eat any pork, so I chose chicken as my meat. I lathered on Alfredo sauce and covered that bad boy in a bunch of veggies. The 'za didn't take long to bake, but I was fairly disappointed. I wanted all my toppings to be melted in and the mushrooms were that over cooked, squishy texture that I love. We ordered a side salad, which to be honest... could have been it's own meal by itself (KUDOS for that!) but it was simple.  I do have to say I love the decor and that they have a little bar you can sit at. Oh! Did I forget to mention they serve beer? Who doesn't love beer and pizza?! (Unless you're under 21, then that's a no to you, you youngins!)  All in all, this place rated about average for us. It was delicious at the time, but I was starving. But I definitely won't be returning anytime soon. Throw me a $5 pizza from Lil Cesar's any day."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing, it's literally my 4x here in the past two weeks and I swear I will continue to be back because of the awesome service and delicious pizza! Everyone there is so friendly! I swear they redefined pizza! I wouldn't want to go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Yuck! Can you say, you say yuck? We went in to try a chocolate chip cookie my buddy said was the best he ever had. They were sold out. But 3 of us each ordered a pizza. The crust was PAPER THIN. They were out of mushrooms. The taste was that of I'd rather eat the box feeling. The staff was should I say........ lacking. Very slow, I felt as if I was getting my oil changed not ordering a pizza. The tables were dirty and the place was empty. SO much wrong I don't know what else to say. Yes I do, NEVER AGAIN. Blaze is SO MUCH better."}
{"text":"We didn't have a great impression of the restaurant we were thought that we had unlimited toppings we ordered a pizza with ham and pineapple that's it and there were like we have to charge you for the pineapple the person that was helping us . Was not trained properly then we call the manager to see what happened because they trying to charge us and then he was very very not professional he  was in not knowing how to conduct ... The business so yeah we didn't have a great impression or great service at all so therefore I even want Star and I probably will not come back to the restaurant it's very bad that they doing false advertising about these restaurant."}
{"text":"Love pizza Rev.  I've been going to pizza Rev since they opened up in LA.  I wish the vegan cheese was free. I love their gf and vegan options."}
{"text":"We went to go to chick fil a and saw this place and decided to give it a try. The concept is like pieology. The food here I awesome, the workers and super friendly and offer help and explain how everything works. They also have beer and wine on tab. I loved the sauce on my pizza, it's very rich with flavor. The only downside to this place is they only had one white wine on tab, and if your drinking from the beer or wine tab, you can only pay with card. I only had cash, and we had $100 bill which they didn't have change for. Understandable about not having change. Those are the reasons for my four star. Other than that, it was great."}
{"text":"This place is pretty tasty.  The staff sometimes have a hard time hearing and have made mistakes on my pizza both times I've been here, but nothing major and I'm sure I'm they would have made it over if I had wanted. The ingredients taste fresh and the crust is good. Pretty pleased overall."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch with a friend and it was so yummy!!! I loved being able to make my pizza just how I wanted it. And it was done so fast The staff was all very friendly and helpful, they were able to make us a pizza that was half and half. I was especially happy that they have vegan cheese since I have an allergy to dairy. Even better the pizza was still warm and tasty when I got home to Henderson 25min away. Definitely will be coming back here when I'm in this part of town."}
{"text":"If you are going to offer gluten free pizza crust you should probably know what that is when customers ask for it!  If you are going to offer Tecate beer, again, you should probably know what that is!  If you need a specific person to put on the veggies, they should probably be working their spot in the service line and not answering phones.  We waited a good 5 minutes for our veggies.  Customer service was clueless!  Pizza was good and the restaurant was clean but I don't think I would be likely to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Damn! How annoying. Their website is down when you try to place an order and you can't call direct to place an order due to \"security\"? Wtf, I've never heard of that for ordering food."}
{"text":"This place has the perfect portion for me when it comes to building your own pizza. I got the regular crust with the white sauce and not having tried any pizza with white sauce before, I fell in love! The variety of meats and veggies accommodating all types of diet restrictions one may have, this place has it all. The employees were very helpful and friendly. I like that they are open later than most restaurants around this area. I will definitely be coming back for those late night pizza cravings!"}
{"text":"Loveeeee!! I hate pizza but when I get to choose my own toppings and sauce for some reason I can't resist. Always friendly!! Will be back in no time!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out today and if you love thin thin crunchy crust THEN this is the right place!  The staff was friendly and explained the options to the customers behind me. I already knew how the assembly worked. I will say this is the best build your own pizza place that I have tried in Henderson. I'm partial to the thin crust that will hold up to all the toppings!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of torn about this place. There's good and bad, but the bad is really a deal breaker.  THE GOOD: The place is cutely decorated, the staff was friendly, the ingredients seemed fresh and they even catered to vegans. The prices are also pretty reasonable for a personal pizza with unlimited toppings, and the pizza comes out super cute and Insta-worthy.  It's everything I want in a restaurant except, you know, the bland tasting food.  THE BAD:  I know what you're thinking, it's a personal pizza place. If I didn't like what I got, it's because I built it wrong, right? But the problems with the food were the fundamental parts like the crust, the sauce taste, and how how they cooked it.  STRIKE 1: The pizza crust is flattened with a machine. It's pretty common practice in personal pizza joints since it probably keeps prices down and it's fast, but it's not as good as hand-tossed. It lacks the right texture, and basically becomes a cracker.  STRIKE 2: The sauces, both white and red, were very bland but somehow distinct (and not in a good way). It tasted like it straight out came from a Ragu jar. Not even the immense amount of garlic, spices, cheese, and toppings could mask the taste.  STRIKE 3: Lastly, when it was time for baking, the process left the bottom of my pizza crisp and burnt, but my mushroom toppings still raw. I'm sure it's hard to formulate the perfect time for all the pizzas, but it's not quite perfect. It half-assed both when it should've full-assed the crust. If the toppings were skinnier, it could've done both. Instead, it did neither.  OVERALL: 2.5/5  They have decent pricing, great service, and a nice environment. I really don't like the food though. For two people at a normal pizza joint, it's the same price for a large, hand-tossed, cheese pizza. And it may not have as many toppings, but toppings, arguably, do not make a good pizza."}
{"text":"The service in this place is great the pizza is really small for the price.  I would go to Pieology to Pizza Kitchen for a much better deal.  Not a fan of a $9.00 pizza for barely one!"}
{"text":"Service is nice, I had a complaint and they reached out so I really appreciate that. I don't like the new vegan cheese that they offer but it's great that they offer a vegan cheese overall. My boyfriend and I used to be regulars. If you're looking for decent cheap personal pizzas this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I don't go to this location anymore due to too many mistakes. Hopefully they've improved now. I changed my review to 3 stars bc I respect the company, but I prefer the rainbow location."}
{"text":"This place is really good! It's concept is similar to Blaze Pizza but much better. It's a little pricey but worth it. The pizza tastes fresh and employees were friendly. Hope they open up more locations!"}
{"text":"If I can give a 0 star I will. Ordered twice for delivery every time the delivery person gave us wrong pizza. Just now we waited 45 mins and then one pizza from our order is missing. Delivery person no apologizes and seems like she doesn't work for the restaurant. She said she doesn't have receipt and she doesn't know anything about the order! try to call them and 10 mins nobody answered the phone. Unbelievable experience with them. I don't know how their delivery system work but it's the worst delivery experiences in my life. Don't you have to check the order or confirm with the delivery person?? two times wrong order and missing order..with about $12 delivery fee! Now we have to drive there and find out WHY."}
{"text":"Cool looking building, had to stop and check it out. Nice inside- the industrial look very similar to Chipotle. Simple menu, one size pizza about 10 inches, you can make your own or choice from some established combos. It is an assembly line process similar to ...Chipotle. After you walk down the line and get all the toppings that you want, it goes into the fired oven. takes about 5 mins, very fast. Cost $8 per pizza. About the same as a custom burrito at ....Chipotle.  The pizza was good...not great. Probably a good place for lunch when a small pizza served fast will do. I ordered two pizzas to go, and they got a little confused at the line,  and later at the register because they came out at different times. But staff was very friendly.  Not the place to go with a group wanting to eat, drink beer and watch a game. Great place to take kids and let them make their own mini pizzas...just like Chipotle."}
{"text":"Finally a decent pizza place. For $7.99 you get to build your own pizza with as many toppings as you would like.  This is differently a family place great for kids. It's a little loud but the pizza is good not great or amazing but it's a lot better than Pizza Hut or Domino's and just about the same on price."}
{"text":"With a few Create-Your-Own Pizza joints here in town finding one that actually stands out from rest is hard to find. I've been to Pieology and between both, I see no difference. Both spots were good, both boasts fresh ingredients, both are priced around the same range, both are quick to cook.  This place was kind of lacking cleanliness tho. Me and my kid went here after the trunk or treat event last night and a bunch of tables were dirty. It looked like they had a slim crew because the guy who took my initial pizza order doubled as the cashier which is at the end of the ordering process. But either than that nothing really different. Their kids meals does have healthy options of if your kid wants to live dangerously they can get oreo cookies instead.  Again, nothing really bad about this place. Food was good, service was ok and they have those kewl coke machines."}
{"text":"This place is like chipotle, quick, easy and reasonable priced.  Unlimited toppings, friendly staff, and again quick and easy!"}
{"text":"Received a cheerful greeting upon entering. Simple, clear menu. You pick your crust and walk down the line requesting whatever toppings you'd like. It starts baking while you pay. If they're not too busy, will bring the pizza to you. As the place gets busier, they'll call out your name for you to pick up. Love the crust, so light and crispy. Toppings were fresh. Self-serve beer taps are handy, once you figure out that you have to hold your wristband up against the receiver to be able to pour. Friendly staff and a very clean establishment. We'll be back!"}
