{"text":"The food just keeps getting worse. Today I stopped in and ordered a Turkey Club to go because I was low on time. The sandwich was thin, the bread was dry, the lettuce was wilted. It had no pickle or side with it. I did not order a drink.   Total cost? $8.03  What a ripoff! How does this place expect to stay in business in the strip district with such better options everywhere?"}
{"text":"my bf got the pulled pork sandwich.  i ate the veggie sandwich.  the sandwiches came with a pasta salad.  loved the sandwich, pasta salad was so-so.  overall, it's a great deli and it's right across the street from our place.  happy!"}
{"text":"we fell on this place while looking for a parking spot in the area. It is really tucked away but glad we popped in. I had the prosciutto sandwich - excellent.... my husband had the turkey and he really loved it, said it was one of the best he'd ever had. They had a great assortment of sodas as well.   I think they forgot to put our pickle on plate, I noticed that people who came in after us had gotten a pickle slice with their sandwiches... Regardless, I would easily pick this place for lunch again."}
