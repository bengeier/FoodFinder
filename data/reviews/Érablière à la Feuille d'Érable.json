{"text":"It is a pretty standard sugar shack. The usual sugar shack food: pea soup, ham, pork rinds, eggs omelette, beans, fried potatoes, pancakes, sugar tarts, cake, doughnut holes and maple syrup! For $19 per adult, you also get coffee, tea and milk.

We did like the fact that it was a smaller and cozier dining room than say right next door which we have also been in a previous year. The décor here is rustic and the plates are China so it feels more like a home cooked meal. 

After the meal, you can head over to the store where they have the maple taffy outdoors (and really as much as you want), visit the animal barn and do a horse drawn carriage ride ($2 a person)."}
{"text":"Sugar Shacks or any place you can go and put maple syrup on everything seems like a place every human being should experience.  For $17 each you can indulge in a pre-selected menu.  Our menu started with pea soup, bread, cabbages, pickles, eggs, ham, potatoes, and other goods and moved into some sweet-tastic deserts.  Ok, picture this:  I re-lived that scene from Elf where Will Ferrel puts maple syrup on everything.   It really is one of the four major food groups.  So they give you this carafe filled with syrup - Daniel and I used most of that on our food.  By the way; Canadian ham is awesome.  I walked out of here and headed to their little store where I was flirted with by the cutest little old guy every - after almost taking him home I settled on some treats to take home for my friends.  Lastly, I really enjoyed my sugar coma; I felt like I was leaking syrup for days after - even my pee began to smell like maple."}
{"text":"C'était pas mal bien.  Cabane à sucre moyenne. 22.75$ pour les adultes et c'est illimités. La bouffe est bonne et c'est un Apportez votre vin (bière). J'ai beaucoup aimé le jambon fumé. C'est pas exceptionnelle mais c'était un bon moment entres amis!"}
{"text":"Sugar shack season is a time I look forward to every year and \"a la feuille d'erable\" really ruined it for me this year.
It started off well as the place is welcoming,small (about 6-8 tables of 20)and quaint with large windows showing a view of the woods and lots of sunlight.the waiter,who was slow and forgetful,seemed nice and polite.
The food was not awful,but disapointing as it was very commercial,had a poor variety,and everything seemed watered down and bland.
The worse and most important part why I would warn everyone NOT TO GO THERE is the management.Upon reservation,I was never warned that I only had a 90min meal time for my group of 20pple.Upon arrival,because we were missing a few people (who were lost and arrived 15min late),they would not sit us down and told us we would only have75 min to eat.About 5 minutes after the desserts finally arrived and we barely had time to eat any of it,the manager barged to our table and yelled out that we had to leave immediately as our time was up.We were NEVER given a warning during the dinner but instead were kicked out like animals.I have more than 5 years of experience working in restaurants and have never seen a manager kick out customers this way when the time was due.We tried talking to her and expressed our shock and how insulted we were at how she approached us.Her behavior was awful,you could definitely tell that she was out of control and was not in a state to even listen to us through her screams and that other customers were waiting.Her screaming and body gestures were definitely scaring children and all the other customers.This could all have been avoided with better management.If i were warned upon reservation, if they had sped up the service this way our group would have finished eating more quickly,and if they would have given any kind of warning regarding the time frame we had left during the meal this experience would not have been ruined.Instead the management left 20 customers angry and insulted,and all theother customers who were witness to the manager's outburst scared and shocked.
PLEASE SAVE your families and friends from being disrespected and having your outing ruined by bad management.AVOID la cabane a la feuille d'erable and warn everyone who is thinking of going there.
When there are so many better choices next door in St-gregoire,do not hesitate to go elsewhere!!!
I will definitely never go back here and instead plan for cabane a sucre Charbonneau next year(my all time favorite)."}
