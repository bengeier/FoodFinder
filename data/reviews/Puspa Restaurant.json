{"text":"This place is not on the main roads but if you are up in the north west, you should make the effort to stop in.  The place is small and cozy and the food is really good.  It keeps us coming back over and over again."}
{"text":"Hands-down I am a huge fan for Puspa where it's a wonderful little jewel for northwest Calgary.  Although Indian food (when made right) is absolutely delicious, diners familiar to this ethnic cuisine know that prices can be steep.  In Calgary, it can be hard to find a good restaurant that delivers in both good food and good prices where you get either one of the two, but not both.  At Puspa, it always delivers in both avenues where food is delicious and dishes are more reasonable than other restaurants.  Key word is reasonable NOT dirt cheap so do expect to be spending a bit more than your average meal at pubs.

Puspa first came into existence in the year of 1993 where it is located just off of Northmount Drive and tucked in a tiny little shoppers plaza.  For first-timers, do take it a little easy in the parking lot as it can, at times, be a rather tight squeeze navigating around or trying to park your car.  
Despite the fact that restaurant is now a bit older, Puspa offers its customers a rather small but very quaint interior where it is a wonderful venue choice for an intimate dinner with family and/or friends.  Sometimes restaurants can face disadvantages of being smaller-scaled, however Puspa manages to takes its close quarters as an advantage where customers will always receive speedy, attentive, and extremely accommodating service.  If you do plan on having dinner at the prime-time of dinner (6-7 o'clock) I recommend on booking a reservation as the restaurant is constantly busy and tables are always full.  Without a reservation, wait-times during busy hours can be up to 30 minutes or more depending on the size of the party.  

 The menu is loaded with numerous choices of beef, chicken, seafood, lamb, and vegetarian curries, along with various versions of naan and rice dishes which will definitely meet the needs of everyone dining there.
Each and every dish are nicely presented where they give great proportions of sauce, meat, and vegetables.  Unlike some restaurants around the city, Puspa keeps it real by actually kicking their dishes up a notch and giving diners that satisfying spiciness to their dishes.  As a last additional note, if you don't have time to dine at Puspa, then I also recommend ordering take-out from the restaurant.  And just because I'm Asian and always like good-deals, they give a 10% discount if you do take-out!

Dish Recommendations:
Samosas
Sag Aloo Bahji
Mixed Vegetable Curry
Naan
Butter Chicken*
Beef Vindaloo*
Madras Beef and Madras Chicken *

* NOTE: I am a vegetarian, however these are recommendations based on friends and family who have had these dishes.  Back in the day when I did eat meat (like 4 years ago) I remember that they were absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"They think they are operating a shack in Bangladesh! 
Food is below average for a Bangla Food
No professionalism in anything

We left with an empty stomach and aching heart with full plate lying on the table"}
{"text":"First time last weekend  at Puspa and it was delicious. From the outside, it looks like a hole in the wall, but upon entry, it's small but clean. We tried the butter chicken, Kashmiri chicken, Sag Lamb and a vegetarian sag. The first thing I noticed was the portion of meat vs sauce. Unlike many other Indian restaurants, Puspa doesn't give me a measly few pieces of meat floating in a liter of sauce. They have a perfect balance of sauce and meat. I even find the prices a little bit cheaper than most places. Everything was perfectly spiced, and the service attentive. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Also a great place to order take out. 

Something fun to look for is the re-purposed neon sign in the window. If you look closely you can see that it used to say 'La Sizzlers'! I have to admire anyone that can look at a La Sizzlers sign and decide that, with a few tweaks, it could be reinvented to say Puspa instead."}
{"text":"I love pupsa. One of the best Indian joints in Calgary. The quirky staff are all friendly and ready to offer suggestions. Try their mango lassi."}
{"text":"I tried out puspa on my way home from work. 
Firstly, DONT ORDER TAKEOUT FROM HERE. For the amount they charge, the quantity is ridiculously small.
For the amount you pay, you can easily eat at any other Indian restaurant with better services.
Now the quality of the food was average. I won't call it satisfying by any extent.
Am I going to go back to Puspa again? No..."}
{"text":"PLEASE READ BEFORE ORDERING: The portion sizes at Puspa were literally some of the smallest I've ever seen... not to mention I was also disappointed to get 4 burnt samosas & burnt garlic naan. I will NEVER order from here again!! 

The Butter Chicken dish (which was $14.50) had 6 tiny pieces of meat in sauce in a little styrofoam container for one, and the vegetable curry ($10.95) was served in the same size. I actually phoned the restaurant back because surely they must have screwed up my order.... Alas, I was told that this was in fact their standard size and I told them that I would never eat here again. Please don't make the same mistake that I made and stay away from Puspa!!"}
{"text":"As a Scotsman I love nothing more than a good hot curry and a bargain! Also love a wee bit of lamb so I ordered the lamb madras,,  which is meant to be hot!! Holy crap it was it near blew my socks off but it was so tasty I couldn't get enough! Which you would think was weird being a fair haired Scotsman but it's true we love a good bit of spice, maybe it's the pain we enjoy haha. I had the lamb madras with vegetable rice and a portion of vegetable pakora, it definitely hit the spot, big portion, very authentic tasting I highly recommend it. (It's the hook line and sinker for my mates back home to visit me)."}
{"text":"We needed some fuel for a late night of work and curry was the flavor of choice, so naturally, I thought of Puspa. I've eaten here before and the food was divine so I couldn't wait to come back.

I swear, they have the best chai in the city! It's rich and flavorful and not overly sweet, which is especially important as I don't add sugar to mine. I enjoyed a cup as I waited for the food to be prepared, and was happy to do so. 

We ordered the butter chicken, the motor paneer, vegetable biryani, naan and papadums, which is plenty for three people. The food definitely lived up to memories of my last visit. 

Don't miss out on this hidden treasure of the NW!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the kind folks at Puspa for stretching their closing time a bit to accommodate my family and me.  My daughter had just arrived at the airport after quite a travel ordeal of cancellations and delays.  I had promised her a satisfying meal and, thanks to their understanding, I was able to keep my promise."}
{"text":"I believe I found one of the true hidden gems of Calgary. Puspa is a very small family run restaurant hidden in a street mall. We went there for lunch in a group of 4. The lunch menu is small but super cheap. You have 4 options of curry (10$ each) which  also includes salad, Chai, soup and desert. Great deal. You also have the option of choosing food from the full menu which we did. 

We ordered the chicken curry (8$) and lamb biryani (13$). I asked for the spicy version. Also to cool it down, we asked for yogurt (Highly recommended).  Both dishes were excellent. The portion size is huge. The biryani was easily good enough for two people. So make sure to go there on a big appetite. One quick note: the spicy is super spicy (Be careful). We finished the meal with rIndian rice pudding and chai which was fantastic. 

Very good service, excellent food and in my opinion authentic taste . Definitely not your standard butter chicken joint. I cannot wait to go back there to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I first discovered Puspa in 1994, on the suggestion of a coworker. It's tucked away into the corner of a strip mall in NW Calgary, and unless you live in the area, it's easy to drive past. John Gilchrist wrote a nice review sometime ago, and since then I don't think he'd have reason to change his mind. We usually go for butter chicken (of course!), lamb tikka masala, motor paneer (a type of homemade cheese served with peas in a spicy sauce), palao rice, naan bread, and mango lassi (yum!). Great food, service a bit on the slow side, and the place is tiny (only 10 tables!), so expect to wait a bit when you get there even if you made reservations (they get busy with takeout orders!)."}
{"text":"One of the few decent independant restaurants in the NW, Puspa is also one of the best Indian restaurants around.

They primarily do take-out orders but eating in is possible if they have some of their tables open.

All your favourite indian dishes are well represented here and are well done too. They also have some persian style indian food (a hot and sour curry) that I have yet to see anywhere else.

There's also a great lunch special daily for both omnivores and vegetarians."}
{"text":"Was here for the first time about a year ago with a friend for dinner.  We shared Beef Korma, Butter Chicken and a few other dishes.  It was decent food back then with decent prices, no wow factor but we stuffed our faces and left satisfied.

A quaint little place off the beaten path with very friendly people working there and they offer take out.

Being that I am the only one in my family who enjoys Indian Food I was having a craving.  So I decided to order one of their Lunch Boxes to Go for lunch one day and of course it was Butter Chicken (one of my favourite all time dishes ever).  I also ordered some extra yummy Naan.

Again I can not say enough how wonderful the people are that were working when i picked up my lunch (perhaps the owners). I brought my lunch home and while it had cooled off considerably it tasted the same as the last time I had it.

The only real disappointment I had was at least 1/3rd of my Naan was still doughy....the rest was delicious.

Their lunch prices are very good, the food decent and the service impressive...I love to support the locals so count on me to be back."}
{"text":"Food taste is good though the portion sizes truly are tiny (see photos).  Naan seems to be consistently burnt.  The restaurant lost one star for food portion and one for the burnt naan."}
