{"text":"I was on a business trip in Montreal and I made reservations for dinner 2 weeks prior. This was my first visit to APDC and the place was just buzzing with energy and the sweet smell of pork. Order the bison tongue as an appy and it was outstanding.  My friend had the seared foie gras and he kept rolling his eyes in delight. The bottle of wine was a beautiful Cote du  Rhone Quartz which paried very well with the meal.  For main, I had the maple pig's foot.  The presentation is shocking... the whole trotter in a cast iron pot with all the trimmings.  The taste was insane.  Skin was sweet and crunchy while the meat was juicy and savory.  The mash potato at the bottom soaked up all the essence from the dish. Very indulgent.  Brought 2 cans of duck in a can and flew them back to Vancouver.  Split one can the next night with 4 senior citizens and they were very impressed.  Gave the other one to a friend and she had hers 2 days later and it was still amazing.  Verdict:  These cans do travel so long as you keep them cold.  They are good for at least 3 days.  How do they stuff all the duck and foie gras with all the tirmmings in a small can?"}
{"text":"I wished I had like a dozen stomachs to try their whole menu!!!!  What we did get to order was nice but frankly not as \"awe-inspiring\" as I had expected after reading all the great reviews of this restaurant.  (So I am spoilt!) Nonetheless, the food was good and well worth a try.  Foie Gras Cromesquis - basically a foie gras liquid croquette which was a tad too sweet for my liking!  Give me a nicely seared piece of foie gras any day.   Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras - you really have to attack this as soon as it reaches the table - hot foie gras with hot pork is great.  Not so great when the pork cools down and you get that wiff of gamey pork smell.  It was hard to take after that. The portion is really huge and you might do well sharing this instead.  Duck Magret in Mushroom Sauce  -  I have never seen so much mushroom served with duck magret before!  It was not a \"SAUCE\" as much as a generous serving of sliced mushroom piled on top of the beautifully seared duck.  Nice touch. The duck was tender and cooked to perfection.  Order your desserts early cos they might just run out of what you want.  The pecan pie was delicious - lots of nuts and smooth syrup base without the gritty sugar bits you get from some pies.  The service can get kinda slow but the food makes up for it.  Try it if you are in Montreal and remember to make your booking early.  They were recently reviewed in the NYT and are getting alot of attention from visitors to the city."}
{"text":"This restaurant sucks big time. Even the french frie is terribleeee!!!!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the rave was about.. or maybe we ordered all the wrong things.   Regardless, we ordered: - the tongue - the sausage - french onion soup - duck in a can  The tongue and sausage tasted super pickled to me.. but the tongue's meat itself was really good. I LOVEEEE French onion soup but this one was way too salty ( I don't really like salt). It was good but too much cheese/salt.  Next, the Duck in a Can was nothing special. The portion of the meat I got was really tough and dry. It looks like someone puked the food out onto a plate... although, the can concept is cool so perhaps it's a novelty thing.  Either way- won't be returning most likely."}
{"text":"We were highly impressed to the fore the sustain that we acclaimed, and of course the meal itself. The assuage allowed for a relaxed, yet enjoyable dining experience. Surpassed our highest expectations - Many thanks to all!"}
{"text":"I have spent 4.5 years in Montreal. That works out to approximately 1,642 days there. How I wish I had the metabolism and the money to spend each and every one of the 1,642 nights dining here...  My absolute favourite is their namesake dish: pied de cochon farci au foie gras. I get to have the two of my favourite ingredients in one dish: pork and foie! How amazing is that!? Even better is that Martin Picard being the insane man that he is; debones the hock and stuffs it with foie gras. Not only that, but he somehow masters the texture to make the trotter crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. Pure. Genius. I think I ordered it twice - one for myself and once to share. I've never finished it even when I ordered it to share. I think this could easily feed 4 people.  Next time I'm in town I will be ordering the tÃªte de cochon. Also am very curious about their pintade (guineafowl)."}
{"text":"Amazing everything. Service was efficient, courteous, and attentive (immediately refilled our bread when they saw that we had extra food gras terrine, which was awesome). The food was everything that people say it is. I suggest ordering as much foie gras as possible, but don't eat anything for a few days afterwards. What we ordered: duck carpaccio, foie gras terrine, foie gras poutine and the pied du cochon."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best restaurants in Montreal. If you're looking for traditional quebecoise fare with an upscale twist, this is the place! My friend and I made reservations 1 week in advance, so we got reservations for 10:30pm on a Saturday night, which I was delighted with because I had heard that reservations were difficult to get. The best part was that once we arrived, we asked for 2 seats at the bar, and we got it! Definitely had the BEST seat in the house because you can look into the kitchen and see the action.  Also, that morning, we had gone on a food tour, and the guide had told us that traditional fare was rich and heavy, so we thought we knew what we were getting into - we didn't. Let others be warned, the food is delicious but RICH. You will leave feeling like you have a lead ball in your stomach all night, but you only live once.   We ordered the beef tongue (delightful, substantial, yet melts-in-your-mouth), risotto (best risotto I've had, incredible incredible bacon), and foie gras/boudin tart (puff pastry was perfect, boudin was delicious, but I wanted MORE foie gras). Dessert was the chomeur (perfect, rich, delicious). We also had their cider and house red with our meal. The cider is refreshing, and light, while the house red was decent, but great for pairing with the rich food.   Overall, this place was an unforgettable experience, and you'll leave with leftovers for sure."}
{"text":"Don't miss this restaurant if you are visiting Montreal or are fortunate enough to live there. You can't go wrong and you'll get a real taste of the local culture. They serve some of the best meat dishes I've ever tasted, and the service is friendly and impeccable. If you can't get reservations, go early, as it's almost always packed."}
{"text":"Definitely make a reservation beforehand (they are closed Monday and Tuesday).  Try to make the reservation for earlier in the night because we got there after 10p and they were already out of a lot of menu items.  Food is very rich and fills you up quickly (tuna tartare, fries in duck fat, foie gras burger and gnocchi with bacon).  Don't order too much.   Loved the gnocchi presentation...they make it table side for you so have your camera out."}
{"text":"I got a reservation via email for 9pm on Good Friday. We showed up and were immediately shown to our table, which was a nice surprise given how crowded the restaurant was at that time. We were seated next to the station where waiters pick up the food, cut bread, etc. It was interesting to see how they do their jobs, but it was definitely where our attention was, instead of on each other and conversation.  Nonetheless, started with duck carpaccio. It was amazing. Very rich with the egg yolk and olive oil, but such a smooth taste. I definitely recommend it. My friend had duck in a can, which is fois gras, duck breast, and cabbage cooked together in a can. It's served with a very rich, dark sauce, with some whipped cauliflower on a crostini. It was very rich and heavenly. I had duck with mushroom sauce. Again the sauce was so rich and earthy, and the duck was cooked beautifully. They serve you alot of food, so we didn't have any sides. I'm glad we didn't, as we were stuffed as it was.  Other reviews mentioned the hostess having an attitude towards english speakers and the waiters being indifferent. We are American and did not get that feeling at all. Hostess was nice, person that did my reservation over email was nice, waiters were nice. They just aren't that into refilling your wine and asking how you are doing every few minutes....but they are nice and get you your food....that's all I can ask for.  In my opinion this place is a MUST go in Montreal, and if I ever visit again, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Foie Gras Poutine - oui! Duck in a Can - ouah! Food coma of heretofore unknown proportions - ouais!"}
{"text":"This isn't a review but more of an acknowledgment of how awesome I think how many times the show Frasier references  'Au Pied De Cochon'. .It's amazing.. thank Niles lol the only thing is they make it sound like there's one in Seattle. Is there? I'm pretty sure the only other location is Paris..."}
{"text":"Live the dream! Great place to hang out with friends around a beer and some really fantastic food. The foie gras poutine is a homerun and the duck in a can a real experience. In the summer, try out the seafood platter."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Very expensive. Food mediocre and overall experience a disappointment!."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  The food was so rich that I was sick all night.  For gluttons only."}
{"text":"A self-proclaimed lover of everything and anything French, au pied de cochon only re-affirms my belief. The place itself is very small and narrow, but cozy. The staff are very friendly and helpful, providing descriptions of all the ingredients that went into the dishes.   As for the food, I ordered the sheperd's pie, and it was unbelievable. Everything about it was incredible. We also ordered a side of fries that were fried in duck fat- not really my thing, but I can see why it would appeal to others. Chef Picard happened to be in the restaurant the night we were there and he actually came around to various tables making sure everything was meeting expectations! APDC would most definitely be a weekly thing if I lived in Montreal (hey, you only live once!)"}
{"text":"APDC is a contemporary restaurant in the Mont Royal neighborhood serving up platters of pigs head, bone marrow, foie gras, duck in a can, the menu goes on and on.  A foodie-meat-lovers' dream so to speak. We sat at the bar because its easier to reserve and we wanted to see the chefs in action.  It's pretty amazing that there are like 4 chefs in such a small space serving up most of the dishes that keep this restaurant going.   It was incredible to watch, so I would recommend it.  We went a little overboard ordering lots of dishes, way more than we could eat ourselves, but we wanted to multiple things on the menu.    To start, we had: Tuna tartare (light, refreshing, succulent, delicious, expertly prepared!) Bone Marrow Blue cheese, apple, and endive salad (I LOVED this dish.  So glad I ordered it; it was different from any salad I've ever had and SO good) APDC Beer  Entrees: Lobster roll with foie gras PDC's Melting Pot paired with the by the glass Cote de Rhone-- this was the dish I ordered; it was a cross section of meats such as blood sausage, regular sausage, pork chop, and pork belly served on a bed of mashed potatoes in a stew with carrots and roasted potatoes in a mini dutch oven. i would recommend this if you want to try a bunch of different meats.  It is very filling though; so if you order appetizers you could probably split it). The glass Cote de Rhone was excellent, HIGHLY recommend that.   For dessert -- the pecan pie with ice cream.  Pecan pie was good, but not the best I've had; hey I'm from the south...sort of.  On my way out I saw the pot de creme and wished I had gotten that, and I will next time.  But the ice cream was delicious and rich and creamy, so def. recommend that.  Overall, a must try while in Montreal.  Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Impossible to get a reservation, but if you can it's well worth the trouble. The food is deliciously fattening, and the atmosphere is entertaining in itself."}
{"text":"I know, I know, I taught Statistics. The proportion of 1 star & 5 star reviews is over-represented in a customer response survey. Nevertheless, I had to write this somewhat negative review because of the exorbitant prices charged by P.D.C.  It's a popular place and so unless you've reserved well in advance, expect to wait for a table or be flat out turned away. OK, I  know all this...arrived a tad early for a bar-side seat and didn't get seated until 35 minutes after arrival...so that makes them 20 min late - not the worst thing for a renowned restaurant.  Another 30 min & no bread, no napkin, cutlery...app of FG with a garlic sauce was good...skimpy on the FG for $29, I thought.   Main course arrived 1hr 30 min after being seated. It was the PDC double cut or something for $46. It was dry & after a few bites looking around for something \"pinkish\" to eat I gave up and gorged on the frites in duck fat.  Again, not the worst meal you'll ever eat but a true let down at $114 (+ two glasses of wine). I can forgive the slow service because that's occasionally part of the deal with a trendy place. The food did not measure up, I let the server know that I was displeased and he...didn't...care.  PS...I have eaten there many times over the years when visiting Montreal...not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Appetizer:  duck carpaccio - very good foie gras 'tout nu' which is pan seared fois gras with a balsamic reduction - the foie gras was good (can't really go wrong with pan seared foise gras) but it was drowning in the balsamic sauce and the 2 pieces of bread that accompanied it was drenched.  Main Course: duck magret with mushroom sauce - the mushroom sauce is like an au jus, wish it was thicker.  the portion is plently for one person or can share, but i found the duck not very flavourful."}
{"text":"Over rated. Not worth the out of the city side trip. After all the rave reviews on Yelp, it was a complete let down. Mcdonalds would have been better. I left a 15% tip, but it wasn't for the food, but for the service.  The water guy was attentive. We ordered the Duck in a can, very little meat, lots of fat about 2/3 of it. The Fois Gras poutine as well was a disapointment. However, the only thing I finished was the appetizer, the duck carpaccio.  The venu was significantly out of the way. For a tourist using the metro for transportation, which was about 15 min walk away, this was the biggest disappointment. The highlight of this excursion was a hammock attraction set up on rue saint-denis."}
{"text":"one of the most overrated restaurants in canada. greasy ass food, salty as fuck, and people call it good."}
{"text":"No quality for your money! We ordered salmon, happy pork chop and pork tenderloin, which needed to be prepared over an hour (?), so we took an appetizer, onion soup, this was only cheese, no bouillon ;-( not good. Wine was was good, but very expensive. A no go! There are better places to spend your money!"}
{"text":"I've only been once, so I'm no expert. But the food was nothing special: rather stodgy, meat 'n potatoes peasant food. Not worth the prices and no way is it worth the hype."}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon delivers great food and service.  My wife made reservations two months before our trip to MontrÃ©al.  We asked the hotel for directions.  We watched for the name of the restaurant as we walked up the street from Parc de la Fontaine.  We walked past three times.  There is no name on the outside, but we finally found the menu on the window.  We made our reservation time which was needed because there was not an empty table.  My wife noted reviews that cautioned about the large portions.  We shared the fois gras, perfect to share.  It was seared perfectly with a delicious balsamic butter sauce on the side (I had to ask it's composition.)  We ordered the duck breast and frites cooked in duck fat.  Again, a perfect portion to share.  The duck was perfectly cooked, moist and juicy inside and slightly crispy outside.  The frites were wonderful and deemed excellent by my wife, the \"Queen of Frites.\"  She rules on the quality of fries around the world.  We were full and noticed virtually every other diner with a take home bag.  The restaurant was full (Saturday night), even at the bar in front of the open kitchen.  I am grateful my wife made reservations.  While. The full house made it bustling with people and conversation, but we could easily hear each other.  The waiter took time to offer suggestions and understand we wanted to share courses recognizing the large portions.  We had his recommended beer, a perfect palate cleansing companion to the fois gras and the duck.  Make a reservation, look for the menu on the window of a crowded restaurant, and include Au Pied du Cochon on your next trip to MontrÃ©al!"}
{"text":"If you like food, you must come here. If you at all consider yourself a foodie, you must come here. If you like yourself as a person, you must come here. If you are alive, you must come here. Just come.  I don't know how much I can add to all of these other reviews, but this place seriously merits each of its five stars. From the cromesquis to the duck in a can to the special dish that's not on the menu (the plogue a champlain), everything is delicious at this place. Including dessert. Oh yeah, make sure to save room for dessert. The chomeur pudding was heavenly, as was the pot de creme. And both came in easily shareable portions. Too often are desserts neglected at good restaurants, but definitely not here.  So come here, sit down, and eat. Eat as much as you can, and then eat some more. Then revel in what you just ate and how life will never be the same.  Note: Reservations are crucial! In March, we were able to get a table a couple of days in advance."}
{"text":"A meal here alone makes a trip to Montreal worth it. Been here quite a few times and the menu is consistently strong throughout. Go with seasonal specialties for the best in-season delicacies. Reservations are reflect the popularity - booked out weeks in advance and often see lineups on weekdays past 11PM."}
{"text":"Making a reservation well in advance, I expected great things from this restaurant with its tasty, rich dishes. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a let-down. Service was slow and poor; there were no apologies made by the server for her tardiness and she did not check in during our meal. It seems like she  focused all her attention on her other four tables, willfully ignoring ours.   With regard to the food, we ordered the duck in a can and the pied de cochon. The first dish had a juicy piece of duck meat hidden under lakes of oil and a solid piece of duck skin with unrendered fat, and of course the foie. I was not quite sure how to attack the fat so I just ate the meat. The pied de cochon was actually served in deep, large bowl - it was that large. It was nothing special, just heaps of food on a plate with little thought to presentation. I thought the pied was also undercooked as I had trouble getting through the tougher and thicker parts of the skin.  All in all, not so great."}
{"text":"Make reservations ahead of time, otherwise you may have a very hard time getting in, or get turned away.  Even with reservations you may need  to wait up to half an hour.  Our group of 3 did but it went by quickly and we got a free drink out of it.  We had...  Tarragon Bison Tongue... amazing, the sauce that it is in has some really distinct flavours.  Duck in a Can... presentation is great, the duck itself was delicious, some people on here don't seem to have glowing reviews of it, but I thought it was great.  The duck is cooked just right and the sauce is absolutely delicious.  \"Pied Du Cochon\"... this was very good, I am not sure if I would order it again because I am a fan of rich full flavours and this had that, but not to the level of some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Very entertaining and pretty good food.  The fourth star is for the unique, fun and very lively atmosphere.  We sat at the bar, right in front of the line cooks stirring and plating, which was great but a little hot from the stove.  We got to see all the dishes being prepared/finished, and frankly, lost our appetite a little for the heavy, decadent food APC is famous for.  So...we started with the little cubed fois gras fritters that were absolutely delicious.  Then, a very large seafood platter which IMO was very fresh but overlywrought.  My favorite items were the plain oysters and clams.  But all the other seafood had sauces/dressing which they frankly did not need.  Ok but it was fun to eat as there were at least 10 different preparations/types of shellfish.  We then shared an over roasted pork chop with wild mushrooms and onions, and a plain green salad.  The pork chop was just slightly overcooked but great flavor.  The salad was underwhelming.  Had a nice glass of white bourgogne.  Husband had vanilla ice cream with a poached pear, which was ok, not great. I would definitely go back for the ambiance, chatty neighbors at the bar, warm (but not exceptional) services and order the really fattening stuff.  I just won't eat for a day or two before!"}
{"text":"I really wish that I could give this restaurant the 5 star rating that everyone else has given it.  In fact it kills me now, as I sit here the day after, out of 130 bucks, and 25 years old and unemployed.  I parted with the cash thinking it would be well-worth it.  In agreement with another recent review, I am forced to rate the restaurant with 2 stars because within the class of restaurants Au Pied de Cochon comes from, it does not live up to the standards and expectations one should have.  I will say, we had an \"endive, apple, and blue cheese salad\" which was fantastic, but that's not reinventing the wheel, nor was it a flawless rendition of a classic.  We also had a really nice \"tomato tartlette\", but again, it was good and delicious, but I would expect the same level of innovation and quality from an OK french bistro in NYC.  In addition, we had the \"duck in the can\"...I realize that the restaurant is not necessarily about nouvelle cuisine and innovation....and more so about  well executed traditional french canadian food.  And, I do love rich food.  But that dish was a compilation of so many rich elements that it was too heavy to enjoy.  And honestly it lacked the well execution, it lacked finesse.  What really ruined the experience for me, was the service.  It was Sunday night, the place was bumping but not inundated.  There was plenty of staff.  The appetizers and entrees arrived in reasonable time.  Granted, I would have liked to have ordered more deliberately, however the server seemed more occupied with invading my space and trying to be charming than with explaining the menu he should know like the back of his hand.  In addition to being super weird, he resorted to shoulder rubs rather than verbal articulation of \"how is everything?\" \"can i get you girls another glass of wine?\"  The clincher was that we waited literally 20 minutes for the duck to be cleared, and the    45 MINUTES    for the dessert menu.  I guess I should have just asked the server for another shoulder rub to pass the time.  We finally got delivered the dessert menu, with another shoulder rub, a wink, and practically cheek to cheek worthless description of the maple syrup pie.  Then I waited another 30 minutes for him to clear the dessert, as he was busy rubbing all the other diners shoulders too.  Then I waited another   30 MINUTES to get the check.    For a restaurant in that class, the service was pathetic and annoying.  And waiting for service while my stomach churned through the most excessively rich dish I have had in my life didn't help my impression.  If the bill was whacked in half, I'd say I got what I paid for.  But all I got from Au Pied de Cochon was a huge let-down on what I thought was supposed to be an exceptionally excellent dining experience.  After a 3 hour crap-dining experience, I was exhausted and disappointed, and didn't feel like going to Barmacie a martini bar, that I promise will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Highlights for our group included the foie gras poutine for appetizer, duck in a can for entree, the chocolate pie and maple bread pudding for dessert. It's a large amount of food for your money-- 2 appetizers, 4 entrees, 2 desserts, and 4 cocktails between 4 people ended up at ~$65 USD per person, and we all rolled home stuffed. Cocktails were also delicious. The free bread that comes with the meal is straight out of the oven. What truly shone was the excellent service and friendliness from both the bartender and server. The server brought complimentary shots to our table after dessert to help us digest our very large meal! Truly a great experience."}
{"text":"Consistently one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal.  Ridiculously decadent dishes usually punctuated with foie gras. (Definitely the polar opposite of low-cal diet food!)  Do make reservations though, this place is justifiably always busy."}
{"text":"We hear the food is fabo. We'll never know. We made a reservation one week ahead for a party of 6. We watched a party of 7 be seated in front of us (assume they had a res, too). We were repeatedly lied to by the hostess. She even told us our table was about to free up because the folks eating there \"just paid their check.\" Turns out no one was paying. She was lying to everyone there. We've eaten all over the world and never seen anything like this. Quite weird. We took our $ elsewhere."}
{"text":"The sinister mind that has the evilness to encompass the creativity of such a menu has the capacity of making the sun itself burn with envy. Chef Martin Picard brings classic Quebecois country style cooking to the city; not reinventing but more reintroducing urbanites to the wonders of pudding chomeur and Jesus ears. I suggest eating salad for breakfast and lunch on the day of your reservation... caloric intake will be equal to at least two days."}
{"text":"A three tiered wooden tea-tray like monstrosity that looked like it came straight out of a Quebec Lumberjack hell.  At the top sat maple glazed doughnut fritters; doughnut holes, Timbits, Martin Picard-Timbits... Mimbits topped with maple sugar cotton candy, that sat atop of a ramekin of maple sugar creme caramel.  Below that was the tier of diabetic's nightmare; sweet maple delights of little cornets of maple glazed popcorn, maple whippets of homemade marshmallow and maple biscuits, homemade crumbled of maple sugar honeycomb toffee, maple canelÃ©s, maple sugar ice cream cones (the ones that used to be sold on the depanneur counters in the open air) and homemade almond croissants.  At the bottom saw a tray lined with tiny mason jar whiskey and maple syrup shots - obviously to weed out the weak ones who couldn't handle the insulin spikes during the first course of the Sugar Shack season, and having them pass out on the floor in a maple overdose coma."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit! La bouffe est excelente, le service rapide et l'ambiance est tres cool! Je recommande vraiment si vous voulez passer une belle soiree!!!"}
{"text":"Started our trip to Montreal with a fantastic dinner at Au Pied de Cochon. Just a short wait to be seated and got a great table by the window. Immediately noticed what a noisy and lively place it was. Started with the prosciutto and crostini which was incredible. My wife tried the codfish fritters which were also very good but didn't finish them because we needed to save room for our main course.  I had the PDC melting pot which was great. The pork was so tender and delicious. My wife had the stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras which was one of the greatest dishes we have ever eaten. Truly fantastic but it was so big and so rich that we weren't able to finish it all. Their Pied de Cochon beer was perfect with the food on a hot summer evening. Service was fantastic and not rushed at all despite the fact that it was very busy. Really a perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"Kind of Okay...Way to much publicity about this place make the expectations go really high. Unfortunately, while there is totally nothing wrong about the place, the high pre-visit expectations cause the visit to be a slight disappointment.  To sum up, the food was good but unjustifiably expensive."}
{"text":"Rich, Rich, Rich....Insanely Rich.  But oh man is it good.   If you consider water fowl your friends, don't come here.    We had the classic foie gras which was delicious.  I am kicking myself for not getting the poutine foie gras because this is probably the only place on earth you can get that combo.  We saw a lot of people get it and they told us it was great.    For entree's my wife got the happy pork chop which looks like it came out of the flinstones with an enormous bone hanging off the plate.  I tried a bite.  I would have to say it was probably the best pork cup I ever tasted in my life.  She agreed.  A t the end the bone was all that was left.      I got the Veal steak special.   It was good, I wasn't blown away because it was actually rather tough.  I had expected it to be melt in your mouth tender.  This isn't to say I didn't finish it.....next time I would probably get something different.    We had also ordered French Fires in Duck fat which the waiter thankfully forgot to bring because I don't think we would have had any room for them.     If you plan to kick off your evening here and then go out to a bar after for some more drinks, don't .  There is no after."}
{"text":"I have read several reviews where people have said that their cromesquis came out cold, but fortunately mine came out hot and oozed in my mouth. Very rich, but not something I'd order again.  I went for the gimmicky duck in a can. It was so much that I barely ate 1/3 of it. So I asked for the rest as take away. We waited. And waited. And waited. Finally we asked the head waitress about it, who spoke to the waitress who'd cleared our tables. Turned out that she had thrown it away! The manager offered free desserts, but we were both stuffed and the dish was $37 and barely eaten. So he took it off the bill. What little I ate was very delicous and fatty.   Some staff are excellent (manager and head waitress who was able to rattle off the HUGE list of specials for the day without looking at anything) where as others are totally hopeless, such as our waitress, who I don't think could speak English. But, seriously, who throws out a full plate of food without even asking if they want to take it home?? There was also another waitress who spent most of the night standing around with a big frown on her face with her arms crossed. But the good made up for te bad.  I would come here again. Even though I starved myself before going, I was still stuffed! Too bad they're not open for lunch."}
{"text":"Totally lucked out on a last minute same day reservation on a last minute trip to Montreal. 10 pm reservation? No problem, my stomach can wait. Easy street parking. Promptly seated by a wonderful host. Waiter was efficient but not overly warm, which is fine by me. The bus boys were amazing, kept refilling water, wiped the table, brought us bread with refills etc. They really kept an eye out for everything we needed without us even asking. The house beer and ciders went well with a greasy meal. From where I sat, it looked like they made most of their food with the wood burning oven which was a sight to see. The foie gras cromesquis weren't as great as some of the reviews had said but it's a good small starter. I didn't really taste much of foie gras. The tarragon bison tongue had some wonderful flavor, we licked the plate clean. However, the dish wasn't as exotic as I imagined, probably because I've eaten lots of tongues growing up. :-)  The foie gras two ways (foie gras hamburger and foie gras poutine) was the bomb. OMG heavenly good foie gras, cooked to perfection. I really wanted to order more food but I was so full...must come back again with a larger group on my next trip! BTW, Martin Picard was in the house....did I say I totally lucked out already?"}
{"text":"Amazing. So impressed with the beef tartare hand roll and carpaccio. Service was great. They took good care of us!"}
{"text":"Delicious. There's not much that I can say that hasn't already been said, but I'll try to add some new information...  If you were SO EXCITED to order the pied de cochon entree (like I was), and booked your reservation for 7pm on a Sunday... just be advised that they might be OUT of that dish! They are closed on Monday and Tuesday and don't reorder the pigs feet late in the week. We were disappointed, but rallied and ordered the PDC melting pot with house made boudin, sausage, pork belly and mashed potatoes in a pot (pretty good, though if you're not a huge fan of boudin, try something else). We also had an amazing bone-in pork chop special with garlic and mushrooms. The specials were extensive so pay attention and listen to your server. We also had a delicious veal tagliatelle appetizer special which was melt in your mouth good. The cromesquis were wonderful (as everyone has said), but ONE per person is probably enough since they're so rich (they're 3.50 a serving).  The service was very good, though at one point they got very busy and I waited 15-20 minutes for a glass of wine. But I was in such a good mood and the food was so great that I wasn't upset.  The atmosphere was lively/busy, but casual. PDC feels like a neighborhood bistro and everyone seemed welcome. It's also a  great menu for tasting and sharing, no matter what your budget. Glasses of wine are reasonable and portions are large.  Go!"}
{"text":"So it's clear that \"pig foot\" sounds a lot sexier French. This place is absolutely gross in the best kind of way. The room is super cool, as it should be. Duluth is one of the classier alleyways in Montreal. The open kitchen offers most of the dining room a view of the black magic underway - who thought one would so enjoy watching a young chef make love to a pig carcass.   I've been here more than once, please don't order this all in one sitting. The Foie Gras Poutine (the fries are cooked in duck fat) is as heavy as it sounds. However, at PDC, the server may suggest it as a light starter. The Duck in a Can is all things fat. When plated, you can watch the duck fat and other oils battling for room.The PDC Melting Pot is offers three cuts plus blood sausage over a cheesy potato concoction... at least I think there were potatoes in there.The Guinea Hen for 2 really feeds 5-6. The beef tartar and bison tongue are on par with everything else. The only dish I've had that I didn't enjoy was the PDC salad. Interestingly, our server warned me upon ordering. We've never had dessert, I don't know if they serve dessert,   This is not the best restaurant in Montreal, but its a damn good one. Also, make this the last stop of the night. The self loathing should set in as you slip into helplessly into a pork-coma."}
{"text":"Second best meal of my life. had the foie gras poutine and the foie burger. Both were extremely good. The price for the quality is second to none. I also love the look of the restaurant and  the service. Our waiter was well versed in the menu and had many recommendations for food and wine pairings. Whenever in Montreal I urge you to go to this resturant."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I have ever been to.  I came here with my boyfriend for his birthday. I got a reservation at the bar 2 months in advance. When we got there 5 minutes before our reservation, we had to wait in line for 15 minutes. Finally we got inside. We sat at the bar, right in front of the kitchen. Well, that was the first mistake. NEVER SIT AT THE BAR. It is tiny, dirty, and you smell food all the time, which made me getting sick and wanting to puke.   The waiter took forever to come and he brought me a different drink than the one I ordered. He kept going from table to table and talking to the customers for like 15 minutes straight. So it was pretty much impossible to catch his attention if you needed anything.   We ordered a starter that was deep fried foie gras. It was ok. Also, why would you deep fry foie grass. Stupid.  After we got the foie gras poutine. It was good but too much foie gras. This is when I started getting sick. Too much meat, gravy, foie grass, smell of the kitchen, food everywhere. It is just way too much.   Then we ordered deer cake with livers and potatoes. It was terrible. I tried it and I felt  like puking so we just ordered it to go and went home and lied down.  Bill was like $100. I am never going to go back here. Also, for those prices I am expecting a clean place, with clean cutlery. The waiter didnt want to change my cutlery after I ate the poutine. Seriously?  Honestly, I dont understand why this place gets so many good reviews. Service sucks, drinks suck, prices suck, place itself is pretty gross and food is okay."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. Martin's rustic, humble yet intricate flavours were spectacular. Ordered veal shank with lentils, au pied de cochon, and foie gras nigiri. First is so tender cooked to perfection, even though on the salty side; im giving the benefit of the doubt that it was just a heavy handed cook. Second is probably the best; Picard transformed the pig foot into something exquisite. The foie gras melted, mashed potatoes were perfectly seasoned, and actual foot was tender. Overall food was sublime. Giving it four stars because the food was not balanced in terms of food groups and/or textures. Also I wish the staff warned that each meat dish was good for 4 to 5 people. Very easy to over order here."}
{"text":"So, my impressions - with the rave reviews we made reservations as soon as our travel dates were confirmed - about 6 weeks in advance.  On arriving, the hostess told us there were no tables available but that she could seat us at the bar (there were at least 3 vacant tables in sight at the time).  After a bit of discussion, we got a table beside the serving station and it became pretty clear that as tourists, nobody gave a rats-ass about us.  The food, well, it was really heavy.  I get it, they like pigs and they're big on meat but seriously, toss a salad into the mix. Over-all, I really wouldn't bother with this place.  Over-hyped and pretty full of itself, Montreal has a lot of other options out of there.  Interestingly, when I mentioned PDC and Joe Beef to a business associate who lives in Montreal, she hadn't heard of either of them."}
{"text":"The wait was long but well worth it. I had the pork chop. There's just something about a wood fired oven and its smoke that adds so much to a dish. The flavors were incredible. The chop was bathed in an earthy, woody mushroom au jus -- simply incredible. I also sampled the duck-in-a-can, very good too, but I'm more partial to the pork chop.  Tip: While waiting on the sidewalk, ask American tourists random questions in French. When they ignore you and hurriedly walk away, end with \"gracias\" just to mind-fuck them ;-)"}
{"text":"WOW this place is a must if you want to try the best foie gras poutine, it just melts in your mouth. Martin Picard rocks."}
{"text":"No duck in a can when I went! Regardless, the food was amazing. Fois grad burger is ridiculously decadent, a little hard to finish. With that burger, prepared to get messy! There was olive oil down to my forearms by the end.   Duck fat fries were definitely not worth the price, tasted like very average fries at most.   Service was a little unfriendly, but it was very close to closing."}
{"text":"So delicious.  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was delicious here.  I had a glass of bordeaux, and with a group of 5 other friends, split a meal of foie gras poutine, a bison rib, duck in a can, pig's feet, and probably more I'm forgetting.  Even the fries were delicious -- crisp and savory.    The only down side is that everything was so filling (and fatty) not only did I not want to stay out and get my drink on on Saint-Laurent, when I got up in the morning I was still full, with that little reflux burp you get after a rich meal.    So I highly recommend it, but either eat light or don't make any plans for afterward."}
{"text":"Food: Only ordered the donut, I'm sorry but Tim Hortons cannot compare. Before eating digging in, the faint scent of chocolate filling is already to die for~ One bite is sufficient to conquer you! Perfect crunchy outside but soft and tender inside, with the liquid chocolate filling, not overly sweet but enough to fill your whole mouth with an explosion of chocolate taste, hm... I'm salivating again now...  Service: Staff are super nice and fast  Value: A little overpriced (like most food trucks)..."}
{"text":"The best for a reason. They maybe overbooked for the night, I had a group of 3 and had to wait an extra 30 minutes for my table. The manager was all over it, though, offered us an amuse and a round of drinks when we sat down. Halfway through the maple syrup beer we had forgotten about the wait. Food was unreal, service was on point, great atmosphere. Manager checked in on us again and got us a round of shots to close the night out. That's how you keep a place going so long."}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of French Canadian cuisine. If you want an authentic Canadian culinary experience then this is not to be missed. The food is not for the faint of hearts and definitely leave your vegetarian friends at home. I wouldn't say this is a good everyday-go-to kinda restaurant so come here when you have visitors from out of town or for a special occasion.   On to our meal. After cleansing our palettes with foie gras croquettes, we were ready for our main event. We bravely ordered the whole pig's head for two and I can say that it has been one of my most memorable meals. The head of pig was roasted to glistening perfection. Paired with apple and root veggies, the whole plate was full of flavour and tender juicy porky deliciousness. Since they have an open kitchen, people took pictures of our food as it made its way towards our table. It was quite the show! Have to admit I couldn't eat pork for a couple of weeks after but it was definitely worth every bite.   Eating at Au Pied is a special event you don't want to miss."}
{"text":"Every once in awhile, you're lucky enough to come across a meal that you'll remember for the rest of your life. It's not necessarily because you would want to eat that meal again and again in the future. It's just that the meal was completely different from any previous meal you had ever eaten.  In the case of Au Pied de Cochon, I don't think I've ever eaten a more decadent, rich, fatty, and hearty meal in my life.   You'll notice a certain common theme based on the list of key ingredients in the dishes that my friends and I shared: foie gras, bacon, boudin, and flaky crust. Having visited Montreal in late December when the weather is beyond frigid and the wind beyond bitter, I understand the genius and madness behind APDC: their food warms/insulates your body with the fattiest parts of other animals.   Let's begin with the cromesquis de foie gras, it's basically a small bite: 2 quarter-sized puff pastries with hot foie gras liquid in the center. Arguably, it was the best bite of the night. Decadent yet light and an amazing way to begin the meal. They come 2 to an order and among the 3 of us, we had 3 orders.  Then there's the much hyped foie gras poutine. It will be possibly the richest, fattiest, most decadent food you will ever eat in your life. One word describes it best: damn. Damn, it's good. Fries covered in an addictive foie gras based gravy, topped with cheese curds and 2 sizable slabs of foie gras. It sounds like suicide but amazingly, it works. Plus you can sop up the leftover gravy with multiple refills of crusty bread.   At this point, our stomachs were feeling it but we trucked on and split the also-hyped duck in a can and the boudin tart. As others have said, the duck in a can, presentation-wise, really does match the hype. It was awesome just watching the server open the can and extract a huge piece of duck breast with bacon, cabbage, and carrots in an earthy sauce onto a plate of cauliflower puree. The duck was cooked perfectly and was tender and juicy, and the vegetables gave it some much-needed flavor and textural contrast.  The boudin tart was also a unique, over-the-top dish with the incredible, almost mineral-y flavor of the boudin and a flaky, buttery crust. However, at a certain point while eating these dishes, I crossed my threshold for excess. Perhaps it had something to do with the dishes naturally getting colder as the eating went on. But, once that threshold was crossed, I was DONE. I realized there was a limit to the madness.   Despite this overload, the saying \"there's always room for dessert\" rang true. We went against our best judgment and split the chocolate pot de creme. Served in a jar with a thick chocolate mousse on the bottom, whipped cream in the middle and little crunchies on top, the chocolatey dessert was irrationally a welcome break from the onslaught of duck and pork we had undergone. It was a fitting way to end a meal that will give me dreams/nightmares through the rest of my life.   For those coming from out of town, I'd highly recommend making a reservation as we made one 3 weeks prior for a wednesday night and it was packed. Also, plan some sort of physical activity for the next morning/afternoon: you will need it."}
{"text":"I first saw this place on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations. Ever since then, I've been dying to come here, because I love foie gras.  I knew what to expect from Au Pied de Cochon: very rich french canadian cuisine. That was exactly what I got. I came here with a group of 3, and we decided to share various dishes on the menu.  First Dish: Foie Gras Cromesquis A nice starter for the table. Fried nicely on the outside and just melts in your mouth with one bite.   Second Dish: Foie Gras Poutine One of the best poutine dishes i've ever had. Not just because of the foie gras, but the gravy and cheese was just amazing. Fries were nice crsipy too. Really good.   Third Dish: Bison Tongue My friends and I will eat almost anything, so we were excited to try the bison tongue. Not only were the flavours all there, but also the texture was really nice. A little gritty on the outside but really soft when you bite into it.   Fourth Dish: Duck Carpaccio I've always loved beef carpaccio, but this was my first time trying duck.  The carpaccio was nice and thin with good seasoning on the outside. It was drizzled in olive oil, and on top was an egg yolk. Very rich for a carpaccio, but very good nontheless.   Fifth Dish: Au Pied de Cochon avec Foie Gras (Pigs foot with stuffed foie gras) Oh my god... the level of richness and deliciousness was almost too much. It was a pretty big dish, but my friends and I finished it. Mashed potatoes on the bottom of the foot. The foot was really really good. First time trying it too. Not much else to say.   Dessert: Poudding ChÃ´meur + Strawberry Pie Once again, very very good. I'll start about by saying that I wish the maple pudding had some ice cream to cut through the richness, but it was very delicious. My favorite dessert, however, was the strawberry pie. One of the best pies I've ever had. The puff pastry on the outside was perfectly crispy and tasty, while the inside was nice and warm with very good flavour. The pie was accompanied by vanilla ice cream, and it was just perfect.  Service: 5/5 Great service. Our waiter was very friendly and competent with the menu. He gave his recommendations and was patient as well. He was also able to help pick out a nice bottle of wine for us.  Overall: Fantastic... If i came here everyday, I'd be dead by 30, but definitely worth going at least once."}
{"text":"The hype is there for a good reason. Had: Foie gras poutine Duck in a can Pecan pie for 2 (came with vanilla ice cream) Everything was fatty-deliciousness-amazing. Looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"Open Reservation 10/7/2017 at 1:30pm for 2 - had to cancel last minute!  I had to cancel our trip at the last minute and can't cancel the reservation. Their policy is 21 day notice to change/cancel the reservations so I'll get charged for not going. They told me if I could get somebody to take the reservation then that'd be OK.  Let me know if you'd like to take it and I'll give you the spot - email me at geemdub@gmail.com. The reservation is for 2 adults at 1:30pm on 10/7/2017. I was really looking forward to going, I'll try to get a reservation again for sugar season!"}
{"text":"I agree with the previous comments about the service being insultingly indifferent, especially to those non-French  speakers. The hostess gave us deadly stares as soon as we spoke English. We were seated at the bar (even thought there was plenty of room elsewhere in the restaurant but we were told they were reserved).   The bread was very good. Then, I had the Foie Gras Cromesquis and the Pied de Cochon, also tried some of the Cured Foie Gras & Boudin Tart. For the Pied de Cochon, the meat was very flavorful but the sauce was too salty and had too much onions in it. The boudin wasn't particularly tasty either. Everything was one dimensional in terms of the flavor. fat fat and more fat!  This restaurant is definitely an acquired taste. My arteries definitely cannot take this sort of hit. With each bite, I can feel the plaques of fat forming in my arteries. For your own health (and wallet), I'd say go once for the Quebecois experience and leave it at that."}
{"text":"I had an extremely underwhelming meal here. Tried the pickled tongue, poutine, a crab special, and PDC melting pot (which my server recommended with conviction). Tasted like standard pub fare - nothing worth making a special trip to. Fries were cold. Joe beef is miles better."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice. The first time I was there we made the mistake of ordering way more than what I could handle, that was easily solved by take out, but it was not the same as having it at the restaurant itself. The second time I learned from my mistake and ordered a bit more appropriately to the heaviness of the dishes and this time I was fully satisfied without exploding. This is as good as Canadian food gets, and it gets really really good!"}
{"text":"Bonne Bouffe mais faut aimer manger gras. Il y a une entrÃ©e avec du foie gras qui Ã©tait tout simplement dÃ©licieuse 5*. On n'a pas aimÃ© le canard dans une ''can'' de conserve. Le service est incroyable 5*.Le ''melting pot'' est dÃ©licieux."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife to celebrate our 1 year Anniversary.   Mistake! We waited 20 minutes past our 8pm reservation-okay fine it's Saturday night... we get seated we get water and our menus right away.   We order a bottle of wine, food is ordered ... an HOUR later our appetizer arrives- tastes good... 20 minutes after that my pasta arrives and my wife's duck in a can comes(well done), manager comes agrees it's over done 5 minutes later new duck in a can comes, too raw Really at a place this well rated? They sear it more and bring it back. They comp her a glass of wine. We eat our meal but it's nothing spectacular. We politely refuse the dessert menu at this point we don't want to be there, they bring the check and tell us the glass of wine is complimentary-Really that's it? Wouldn't offer anything else. $200 (not well spent) and 3 hours later, please go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Everybody should definitely believe the hype about this place!!!  Every single item on the entire menu is a decadent heart attack.  Trying the classics like the poutine foie gras and the duck in a can are musts."}
{"text":"Cuisine fusion quÃ©bÃ©coise-franÃ§aise : ingrÃ©dients locaux, techniques d'inspiration franÃ§aise le tout formant une sorte de festival d'excÃ¨s qui fait du bien, bien que seulement Ã  l'occasion. Attention, la plupart des plats sont trÃ¨s riches. On voit parfois des couples se partager un plat Ã  deux, question d'allÃ©ger, on suppose. Ce restaurant comporte l'un de mes plats favoris Ã  MontrÃ©al : la poutine au foie gras. Bien que la combinaison peut sembler une offense, le rÃ©sultat est un dÃ©lice (mais c'est riche, trÃ¨s riche). Les tartes sont aussi mes favorites en cette ville et, de plus, leur sÃ©lection varie avec les ingrÃ©dients disponibles en saison. Le style de l'endroit tient du bistro trÃ¨s informel ce peut donc s'avÃ©rer un endroit trÃ¨s bruyant. On peut s'asseoir au bar pour avoir vue sur la cuisine ouverte. Les prix sont Ã©levÃ©s, mais proportionnels Ã  la qualitÃ© des techniques et des ingrÃ©dients et ce n'est pas un resto de la formule  apportez votre vin . C'est dommage qu'ils ne soient pas ouverts pour le lunch, parce que de la cuisine si riche serait plus digeste plus tÃ´t dans la journÃ©e nÃ©anmoins, quand on s'aventure devant ce resto tÃ´t le matin, on peut voir que les gens sont dÃ©jÃ  Ã  l'oeuvre pour prÃ©parer le soir !"}
{"text":"Foie gras, foie gras, foie gras! My wife and I had been looking forward to trying this place for a while. We brought our two year old here and were not disappointed. A nice bottle of wine and tried just about everything we could with foie gras! Service was excellent and will happily go back on our next trip through here."}
{"text":"Really, really, really enjoyed my time here. I sat at the bar and enjoyed seeing the staff at work.  What I had  Cromesquis de foie gras - Flavor bomb, they'll tell you to give it a sec before you take your bite or else you'll burn the roof of your mouth.  Langue de Bison Ã  L'estragon (Bison Tongue) - Great flavor and texture. I am a fan of beef tongue when done right and this bison did not disappoint at all.  Canard en conserve (Duck in a can) - Great presentation, very balanced.  Poutine Avec Foie Gras - Shaved some years of of my life  Strawberry with Goat Cheese Tart - Just the right amount of sweetness cut through by the goat cheese. It was a great way to end the meal.  Overall it was a great meal. I'm kinda disgusted and kinda proud that I was able to throw down that much food, but when in Montreal, I guess. The service was very attentive. I'm pretty sure I took some years off of my life, but it was worth it. Hope to be back one day."}
{"text":"Well, one of the best meals I've ever had, no question. To start, this place is on Duluth, which is lined with cool and eclectic restaurants, bars and shops. The kitchen features an enormous wood fired oven, the dining room has several large windows facing the street which give a nice open ambience.  For dinner, my wife and I snacked on the expertly baked bread with some absolutely delicious butter. To follow, we ordered the fried zucchini blossoms, which were lightly battered and well seasoned. For entrees, I had the duck magret, which was wonderfully earthy, rich and cooked to perfection.  My fiancee had fork tender, rich and also earthy braised lamb with lentils. Both dishes were fantastic.  For dessert, we shared the best non-chocolate dessert either of us have ever had, the \"Pouding ChÃ´meur.\" This basically tasted like, vanilla, butter and maple...the holy trinity of non chocolate dessert ingredients. Unbelievably rich and decadent, what a memorable end to an unforgettable meal."}
{"text":"My first encounter with poutine was at this restaurant - we ordered the poutine with foie gras and it was delicious! All poutines paled in comparison after this. We had the pied de cochon (pig's foot) - the meat was melt in your mouth amazing and perfect for a cold, windy night however the dish was more than enough for two people to share. In addition, we also had the duck breast but to be honest, it was nothing to write home about.   We did take our 3 1/2 year old daughter with us. The restaurant is noisy so she went unnoticed. I didn't really think it'd be a problem since our kid is pretty well-behaved and is a little cochon when it comes to eating!"}
{"text":"When I found out I was going to Montreal I had to check with my fellow yelpers to find a nice place for dinner. De Cochon came highly recommended not only from yelpers but also the locals. We had reservations for a Wednesday evening and had I had known they have a counter I would have requested that as I love watching the fast paced action of a high end kitchen. We were seated by the door which was definitely not the best spot in the house and having a reservation for over two weeks in advance I would have thought we would have had better seating arrangements. The wait staff was very professional the waiter took time to explain the very interesting menu and assisted us in picking a nice french Pinot Noir. We started with what the locals said was one of the chefs best dishes, the pomme frites cooked in duck fat with curds and gravy topped with foie gras. It was delicious to say the least. The GF had the roasted pork and I opted for the Bison Ribs. Both were excellent choices the pork was tender and juicy and the Bison Ribs were coated in a wonderful sauce that had a slight ginger flavor to it.  We finished with the house specialty for dessert which is a small cake surrounded by local maple syrup MMM, MMM, MMM! It was very interesting almost like having delicious pancakes smothered in maple syrup.  It left us both with wonderful smiles on our faces.  Other than the poor seating we had the meal and service were very good and I would highly recommend it to anyone heading to Montreal!"}
{"text":"I have raved about this place ever since dining there a year and half ago.  This is hands down one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.  The beef tartare and PCD melting pot (5 types of meat, potatoes, cheese, and spices) were absolutely phenomenal.  If you are in Montreal, this is a must go to spot.  Only downsides are it is a little small and a little loud."}
{"text":"Holy foie gras city. As many people have mentioned, the foie gras poutine is absolutely amazing. I was not at all disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. It's a tad crowded and very loud but that definitely contributes to the whole \"Quebec cultural experience\". One piece of advice - pace yourself and don't let your eyes win over your stomach this time... 2 appetizers can fill you right up due to how heavy the ingredients are. Definitely worth the visit! Oh and our waitress was the bomb! 5 Star service!"}
{"text":"Allow me to begin by saying that I rarely ever put my thoughts out on the internet...  And yet here I find myself two weeks later, writing an honorary toast to one of the greatest chefs the world will ever see; and at the same time, struggling to suppress my arousals at every slightest reminder of the kind of night we had.  Every once in a while, mankind will be come across a legend that will change our mind on everything we thought we knew about our existence. Nelson Mandela revolutionised South Africa, Michael Jordan shook up Chicago, and here in Canada, we are celebrated by the wild, incredibly talented, and fearless Martin Picard. People frequently ask \"What exactly is Canadian food?\" and I never really had an answer until now.  Food served up here has more of a Quebec flair, but don't be fooled, this is not a pretentious Franco-Canadian dining room. From the moment you walk in and smell the fatty aromas, you know exactly what you're getting. I strongly suggest going with your gut feeling, because by the end of the night, you won't be feeling your gut any longer.    CÃ´te de Cochon: So uncomplicated yet so unforgettable. So unassuming yet so unapologetic. My still-to-be-educated mind made the mistake of doubting the pork chops in this establishment, and damn was I humbled. The pork that is so tender and so juicy deserves more credit than my photo is giving it. The real show stopper is having each slice with the jus, that I still yearn for in my pillowy dreams.   Canard en Conserve: The piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance, the bright light in these darkened times, the one amazing dish that can entice the feeling of gluttony, love and fierce loyalty (if that's not obvious enough by now). All the ingredients come together like a symphony on your taste buds. The foie basically melts and fuses with the duck breast. And the jus again does miracles to the meat, imparting smoky sweet bacon, earthy herbs and delicate cabbage with every bite. Also the whole duck-coming-out-of-a-can provides some theatrics for the 'gram, ya know what I mean?  It has just been decided that Au Pied De Cochon will set the bar on my Yelp account as the only 5-star rating I will ever give. No review prostitution going on here.   Vive le MontrÃ©al  (Oh, and wear loose clothes)"}
{"text":"Ah, the house of the pig. Had this place bookmarked for years after all of the notoriety surrounding it. Ended up getting a last-second reservation around 10 on a Friday. Felt very lucky.   Had the cromesquis (small fried foie gras conduits)-- which were delicious, the foie gras burger, cooked medium rare, which was the most flavorful burger I've ever had. The foie gras pizza-- delicious, fatty, and so greasy, loved it, as well as the duck fat fries.   Opted to skip the duck in a can (just didn't find it exciting), but we left thoroughly satisfied. Casual, friendly, fast service with delicious food that wasn't super expensive. I felt like I had a very expensive meal but split between two of us it was $43 CAD each after tax and tip.   You should check it out if in town-- only note that the bar is NOT open seating on the weekends."}
{"text":"I went this restaurant twice during my recent visit to Montreal because I had previewed their menu online and there were so many choices that there was no way we would be able to experience it all.  A good portion of their menu contains foie gras (of which they are very famous for) but they also have a lot of fresh seafood.   On the first visit, we had the bison tartare and foie gras cromesquis(which is a deep-fried breaded foie gras ball, similar concept to deep fried mozza sticks). The cromesquis were absolutely divine!  My friend ordered the french onion soup. It was very rich and had a strong wine flavour. For entrees, my friend had the infamous \"Duck in a Can\". She loved it while I thought it wasn't really my style. It was very heavy and rich. She loved the flavours. I would recommend it to someone who likes stew-like dishes. The foie gras that was in this dish was a little to overwhelming for me. Again, this is a personal taste thing. I ordered the lobster-roll with foie gras on top. This dish was fabulous! The lobster-roll was on-par with some of the best ones I've had in Maine. The bread was toasted perfectly. The slices of foie gras on top made it even more decadent. The lobster had a perfect texture and were in large chunks.  On the second visit, my friend and I shared their dinner special which was arctic char for two with a pesto on top and served with deep-fried polenta sticks. The fish was cooked to perfection. I was really surprised that we were served the whole fish on a giant platter and this entree was only $50. Usually when I order an arctic char entree at other restaurants, I would only get a small section of the fish and the entree would already by around $25.    The service on both visits was excellent. I couldn't have asked for better. The servers were very patient and very good at explaining the menu. Definitely a very memorable experience and a must-try (at least once) in Montreal. If you've never had foie gras before, this is the place to experience it. They don't skimp on the foie gras portions and you really get to truly experience the taste of foie gras."}
{"text":"Un resto comme Au Pied de Cochon se passe de prÃ©sentation. Ouvert depuis 2003 et situÃ© sur la petite avenue Duluth, le restaurant du cÃ©lÃ¨bre Martin Picard s'est bÃ¢ti une solide rÃ©putation, tant au QuÃ©bec qu'Ã  l'Ã©tranger. C'est pour souligner la fin d'une longue session universitaire que nous sommes allÃ©s, en groupe, vivre notre baptÃªme du Pied de Cochon.  BOUFFE  Comme d'autres restos de sa trempe, il est difficile d'attribuer un type de cuisine particulier au PDC, mais sachez simplement que le tout tourne autour d'ingrÃ©dients locaux...et du cochon.  En pleine saison des sucres, un daiquiri Ã  l'Ã©rable (11$) Ã©tait sur le menu ce soir-lÃ ; pour ma part, j'ai essayÃ© leur biÃ¨re maison (5.50$). LÃ©gÃ¨re dÃ©ception en dÃ©butant la soirÃ©e; la saveur de l'Ã©rable Ã©tait quasi inexistante dans les daiquiris et la biÃ¨re Ã©tait un peu faible Ã  mon goÃ»t (une 4% je suppose).  Un autre item qui ne figurait pas au menu rÃ©gulier, la salade de canard (~14$), composÃ©e de pommes de terre, d'un Âuf et de tous les morceaux imaginables d'un canard.  MalgrÃ© la modeste portion, la fameuse Poutine au Foie gras (23$) est facilement partageable Ã  quatre Gourmands, tellement c'est riche (gravy au foie gras quand mÃªme).  Le dÃ©licieux melting pot du Pied de Cochon (20.50$), dans lequel on retrouve, entre autres, du boudin et des saucisses.  Mon coup de cÂur a Ã©tÃ© la CÃ´te de cochon heureux (25$). Couvert d'oignons et de champignons, la viande est cuite Ã  la perfection et tout simplement dÃ©licieuse.  Nous commencions tranquillement Ã  Ãªtre rassasiÃ©, mais il y avait encore deux plats en route. Pour prendre une brÃ¨ve pause de cochon, on a Ã©galement choisi le plat de Poisson du jour de la Nouvelle-Ãcosse (~36$), servi avec une sauce bien crÃ©meuse, des tÃªtes de violon et des champignons. Comme quoi, il n'y a pas que le porc qui est maitrisÃ© dans la cuisine du PDC.  Finalement, on a conclu le festin avec rien de moins que le Pied de Cochon (22$). CachÃ© sous une Ã©paisse peau, on retrouve une chair trÃ¨s savoureuse et tendre. La purÃ©e de pomme de terre qui l'accompagne est tout aussi succulente.  Malheuresement, on n'avait plus de place pour un dessert, mais ce n'est que partie remise.  SERVICE/AMBIANCE  Ã l'image de la bouffe qui Ã©tait servie, le service Ã©tait impecable. Notre serveur connaissait tous les plats en dÃ©tail et prenait le temps de nous les expliquer. Le souper s'est Ã©talÃ© sur un bon trois heures, mais en aucun temps on s'est senti pressÃ©, malgrÃ© la ligne qui commenÃ§ait Ã  se former Ã  la porte. Une ambiance assez animÃ©e reigne dans le resto et la cuisine semi-ouverte crÃ©e un certain charme.  Ce qui me plaÃ®t aussi du PDC, c'est les prix assez raisonnables des plats principaux. En effet, on a partagÃ© six plats, avec consommations, pour un grand total de ~55$ par personne, ce qui est pas mal moins cher que dans d'autres restos du genre.  Notre prochaine visite est cÃ©dulÃ©e pour le mois prochain et j'en salive dÃ©jÃ  !  COOL  - La bouffe, tout simplement. - Pour ceux qui ne le savent pas, il y a aussi la Cabane Ã  sucre du Pied de Cochon, maintenant ouvert pour la saison des pommes, Ã  l'automne.

{"text":"Crowded and loud but great for adventuresome eating.  Fois GRAS poutine is to die for.  Pork, pork and more pork on the menu.  A true culinary and gastronomic experience."}
{"text":"Rather than adding more noise to the already crowded Yelp page for Au Pied de Cochon, I'll do what I like to do in this situation and give you my top five list on why you should eat here:  1. The open kitchen so you can watch the quick moving -- and good looking -- chefs freshly prepare everything before your very eyes! 2. Bison tongue, Duck in a Can, and Sugar Pie. Nom, nom, nom! 3. Foie Gras Poutine, and prepared about 15 other ways 4. Amazing staff 5. Martin Picard running the kitchen in shorts and a Dickies shirt.   In a word: Awesome."}
{"text":"It is disappointing when a restaurant with such notoriety coasts off of their reputation. This is what we found here. It is true, the food is good, well-executed, and original. A failed lobster \"sundae\" notwithstanding we found all the dishes to be exactly what we expected. The problem was the service; it was a mess. Even after waiting an hour to be seated for our reservation (which is totally unacceptable) we were in the mood to forgive. Unfortunately the wait continued for another 30 minutes while the staff stumbled to properly set our table, take our order, and bring out our first course. By this time it wouldn't have mattered if Martin Picard himself was preparing our meal tableside, we were tired and hungry and no longer in the mood for the bungling service. Moreover, other botched details of the service, too numerous to mention, indicated lazy management and poorly trained staff (at one point I had 3 forks!). Overall, we just didn't have a good time and felt like we had wasted our time and money and there is no excuse for that."}
{"text":"We live in NJ but try to get to Au Pied de Cochon once a year. It's absolutely fabulous. The service in impeccable, they time everything perfectly. If you want to eat something unforgettable try their lobster roll.  Perfectly cooked lobster on a home made toasted, buttered roll with foie gras and cheese. You cannot imagine how amazing it tastes. My wife & I split 2 appetizers, the lobster roll and the poutine. We have been talking about it ever since. Go- or at least put it on your bucket list."}
{"text":"This is easily one of Montreal's best restaurants.  APDC is tucked away in one of the most quaint parts of the city in a beautiful, modern, understated space.  To-die-for food, amazing service - and yet somehow the whole thing remains casual - like you want to have a glass of wine with the staff after they're off work.  Maybe it's the deep-fried foie gras seated next to a pigs foot and mountain of cheesy mashed potatoes, but I think they've struck a rare chord where you feel like you're having this fabulous, over-the-top dining experience while completely avoiding any kind of pretension."}
{"text":"I know you're like, \"1 star?! What's wrong with you?!\" I went on a Thursday night with 3 friends, and this place was PACKED.   Ambience: Too many people packed into too little space. Everyone is yelling over each other and you can't even have a nice conversation with your friends...The waiter had to yell out the day's specials for us to hear over all the noise.  Service: Really good service by the waiters, but seriously, it took 30 minutes for our salad (just salad with blue cheese) and 1.5 hours for our mains to come out...Food took way too long to come out.  Food: Presentation of the food is barbaric. I know this place is all about no-nonsense-go-big-or-go-home food, but seriously, we all ordered the day's specials (steak sandwich, fish of the day, fish & chips) except for one (foie gras poutine) and they were not presented nicely at all. Mine looked like roadkill...It was a steak sandwich. It sounded nice, but it was too smothered in herb butter and thick gravy, with huge chunks of meat that tasted a little too elastic.   The food didn't taste amazing....None of us were happy with our food, except for the one who ordered the foie gras poutine lol. For the price they charge, I think the food actually tasted a bit too cheap.   Also, there's only one washroom for the whole resto, and it's unisex. I was very surprised that they had bar soap...no liquid soap....just a bar soap that you would use at home...  Overall, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Really? Almost 5 stars after 200 reviews? This place must be good!  So I wanted to try it so bad! Even if they are fully booked while we were in Montreal so we ordered take-away!  Maybe the duck has been in the can too long (a 10 min walk), it was tough.   The foie gras poutine was not bad but not fantastic.  The meal was too rich for my liking. A bit disappointed bcos ducks and foie gras are my 2 loves.  But i am still glad i tried it and judged for myself! How can I be a food lover and not try the famous Au pied de cochon, even if it did not live up to my expectations?"}
{"text":"It's too heavy/fatty for me! I had the foie-gras poutine and the duck in a can, and it's a bit too much of grease! i won't be coming back...but the place has a good vibe, and I can understand why is so popular!"}
{"text":"We went there a bit before the opening just to be sure to get a seat. The service was a bit slow but the waiters were very knowledgeable. We had a poutine au foie gras which was fantastic. It was very rich and went down nicely with a glass of white wine.  We also had the bison tongue and the horse tartare which were both interesting and tasty. I've also had the luck to try out their food truck, but it was not nearly the same experience and I definitely recommend going to the restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Not nearly as expensive as I had thought and the food was great.   The specials were great, the beer was good, the drinks were good and the main menu was awesome.  Only one thing disappointed: the foie gras poutine didn't come out warm. Everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"I was hoping to post a 5-star review since this meal was what I was looking forward to the most in Montreal.  Placed a reservation weeks in advance for this restaurant because it seems from previous reviews that it was recommended.  Communicated through the email with the hostess who was very friendly.  Arrived to the restaurant and was promptly seated in a heavy traffic area where a lot of the bread gets cut and where a lot of the food is left to cool off before it heads to the clients table.    Server took our order promptly which included:  Cochonnailles Platter (3.5/5) - assorted meats Foie Gras Poutine (5/5) - fries, gravy, cheese curd, foie gras Happy Pork Chop (3.5/5) - giant pork chop with mushrooms, etc Tartellette Champi (4/5) - cant remember this one, I believe it was one of the specials of the day  We would have liked for the waiter to explain the meats of the cochonnailles platter instead of us having to ask him when they came out.  The happy pork was a little dry and was doused with sauce (mushroom/onion sauce).  The waiter also disappeared for some time and was no where to be found a few times during the 2 hour meal.  The meal overall was quite tasty with lots of flavors to wet the pallet.    For the final part of the meal we ordered the creme brulee.  It was supposed to be the final highlight of the meal but failed.  When it came out it was burnt on the top and the first bite I took was a very bitter bite.  My girlfriend also did the same and agreed that it was overcooked on the top.  We decided to tell the waiter (who was not our actual waiter since he disappeared) who dropped off the double espresso and latte we ordered.  Then the manager (possible GM) came by and decided to tell us that we were wrong and that they way it was cooked was correct.  Excuse me.  I didn't asked to be told that I was wrong and that all the other restaurants use regular sugar while they use brown sugar.  Just apologize and ask me if I would like something else.  Simple as that.  He eventually told us that all the other restaurants do it wrong.  At this point I wanted to slap the dude and state that I have had creme brulee in many different parts of the world and this was the first time that I had burnt creme brulee. He then let us order something else, in which we then had the cheesecake.  The cheesecake (4/5) was good but it is no cheesecake factory cheesecake.  Overall my experience at this restaurant is mixed.  The final bill totaled 137.74 (pricey).  I probably will never come back since I live in SoCal.  And I am sure the next time I order creme brulee in SoCal, it will be done right!    Cheers."}
{"text":"Just returned from Dinner. I don't understand the hype. The issue was the food. Service was good. Attentive. Comesquis. Were a good start. Fois gras pout nu was also OK. Not special. Tomato tart was very average. Not unlike something you'd eat on a fast food pizza. My Bison rib was good. Vegetable accompaniment was beets tasting substandard. Also came with fries that were just ok. My wife's pork chop was so overcooked it was inedible. After returning to kitchen, the next try was deemed ok. While adequately cooked, the flavor reeked of onions. The pork taste never came through. Dessert was melted vanilla ice cream and ok tasting chocolate pudding. The red wine was also ok. Not great. For perspective, this was our fourth dinner in Montreal. All prior dinners ranged from superb .... Le Filet to Great....Les 400 coupes. Then along comes Au Pied De Cochon, touted as an absolute must. The reality is that APDC doesn't hold a candle to the top names in Montreal. It is resting on it's laurels. Martin Picard needs to reevaluate the current sad state of this place to return it to it's former glory. Until then, I won't return and can't recommend it.  Having had the time  to sleep and rethink my review above, I can now clarify my negative feelings for  last night's meal.  Previous reviewers have complained about the lack of service,  overwhelming richness of the food and cramped quarters. None of this applied in my case except for cramped quarters which took it's toll at the end of the meal ( more about that later ).  This was a case of ill prepared , tasteless and poorly presented food. The only exception to this was the Cromesquis which were an enjoyable start to the meal.  Foie gras pout nu.... This was not NAKED as advertised. It was covered with a thick balsamic reduction which totally overwhelmed the flavor. And far from being large ,the portion of foie gras was somewhat skimpy given the price.  Tomato tartlet.....this dish lacked flavor. The tomatoes we're flavorless.very pedestrian dish.   Happy Pork Chop.... As stated above, this was overcooked to the point of being inedible. The next version provided by the kitchen was cooked well but the preparation required seasoning and was overwhelmed by an onion taste..  Bison Rib.... I thought it worked well enough. Just nothing to write home about .vegetables on the side were almost unidentifiable. French fries were ok to good.  Wine... The selected  red wine tasted cooked. Just OK  Chocolate pudding....good but indistinguishable from other average versions.  Vanilla ice cream. Hard to mess this up but it arrived half melted.  As for seating.... we were seated in a 2 top at the front of the restaurant. This worked well enough until a large party arrived and were seated in front of our table along the window. Elders in the group required space to the point where the gentleman in back of me was now seated alongside of me and the woman to his side cramped my legroom as I was now pressed against my table not knowing whether to laugh or cry. I was exteremely uncomfortable as the hostess looked upon the situation with horror.  I couldn't wait to leave. The manager approached. When I described the litany of my experience I focused on the kitchen line as the culprit. He , in the end, agreed.   My bill came to 200 dollars. Not a bad price except when you consider how appalled we were by the quality of the food.   As I stated above, when you compare APDC to the other top restaurants in Montreal, please be warned. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome. Unbelievable. What more can I say. This might be the best restaurant I have been to. It might have something to do with the fact that I love duck:)"}
{"text":"One of the best Montreal restos I've been to in a long time.. and that's really saying something in a city known for it's amazing traditional quebecois food! Bring your appetite - we're talking lumberjack portions here!    Everyone raves about it (and rightly so) but the 'poutine au foie gras' is a must i think it might be the first step towards world peace. The 'potÃ©e du PDC' and the pecan pie are also devine and should not be missed! The service and overall atmosphere are excellent so make sure to reserve ahead because it is always full, and standing in the doorway watchin all those fabulous meals go by is no way to spend an evening."}
{"text":"Une belle ambiance  ,  mais un peu trop  entassÃ©s  ! Malheureusement  ,  il n'y a pas de salle d'attente  ,  alors on est prit Ã  attendre Ã  l'extÃ©rieur qu'ils nous appel  .CÃ´te nourriture , les plats sont trÃ¨s original  . Il avait beaucoup de foie gras dans une grande majoritÃ© des recettes . Les gens avec moi ont trouvÃ© Ã§a un peu trop ( foie gras ) !!!  Ã dire vrai  ,  je m'attendais Ã  plus  basÃ© Ã  ce que j'ai vu Ã  la tÃ©lÃ©vision et d'aprÃ¨s les autres reviews ."}
{"text":"This place is very busy and it is impossible to get a last-minute table.  However, if you can plan in advance, it is simply amazing.  I always sit at the bar so we can talk to the cooks during diner."}
{"text":"Trop c'est comme pas assez.  Des plats qui contiennent 25 ingrÃ©dients, la plupart qu'on ne peut gouter.  Des plats qui n'ont rien Ã  voir avec une cabane Ã  sucre, des fruits de mer, des pÃ¢tes, une demi tÃªte de cochon avec Ã  peu prÃ¨s rien de mangeable.  Certains plats Ã©taient trÃ¨s bons mais c'Ã©tait la minoritÃ©.  Les desserts sont bons. L'ambiance est terrible, tassÃ©s sur des bancs de bois, du bruit infernal mÃªlÃ© avec de la musique tellement forte que les pauvres serveurs doivent crier pour se faire entendre.  Le service se limite Ã  nous apporter les plats Ã  la table, crier ce qu'ils sont et ensuite on doit se servir nous mÃªme.  Payer $100 (incluant une biÃ¨re Ã  $15) pour manger des choses moyennement bonnes avec une ambiance pourrie et un service moyen, je trouve Ã§a cher.  Plus jamais, merci."}
{"text":"This was our second time to Au Pied de Cochon, after having an excellent meal the first time. Unfortunately, this time around we were slightly less impressed...the meatloaf, which was one of the specials of the day, was very salty and the staff forgot that it was my boyfriend's birthday, even though I had made a special request when making the reservation and reminded our waiter during the meal.  Having said that, the food is generally quite tasty and the ambience is lively.  The staff is friendly and professional, but disappointing that they would forget a special occasion, since you would expect more from such a quality establishment."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The Duck in a Can and the Foie Gras Tart are truly top notch. Excellent wine list too."}
{"text":"We drove 7+hrs from NYC to Canada for this, and I'd gladly do it every season.  The food is pretty much the best I've had in my life. Even though the restaurant was stuffed with guests, the waiters went above and beyond for everyone. The maple cocktail was incredible, and went well with the meal.   The meal is definitely fit for a larger group. There's so much food you're pretty much guaranteed to have plenty to take home."}
{"text":"Foie gras, foie gras, foie gras. What can I say, almost every dish has foie gras in it!! This is heaven for a meat lover (which i am)...vegetarians beware -- do not come here as it's not for you.  We had a group of 6, the table was a bit slow in front of us so we had to wait 30 min beyond our reservation time, but they were nice and gave us a free round of beer. Kudos.  Now to the food, we had the maple ham,   duck in a can, foie gras poutine, stuffed pied du cochon with fg, dumplings, foie gras bolognese pasta, and another dish I can't remember the name of, but it definitely had foie gras in it.....  I would say a must is the maple ham (which is a special during Christmas time, very very succulent), the stuffed pied du cochon with fg, and the foie gras poutine.  The foie gras bolognese was a special, would've been much tastier if it was hot; pasta was a bit cold. What was cool about this was that they cooked it in front of you on a thick slab of cheese. They first put the pasta into the cheese slab, put hot water,  then put the bolognese sauce on, and then the foie gras. As they plated it, the scraped a lot of cheese off...so you get a very cheesy dish, literally.  Overall, everything was very tasty. For the price, you definitely get a lot of foie gras as well....so well worth it!"}
{"text":"i think there is no need to introduce this nice experiment of Martin Picard. If by any chance you are reading this review on december 1st, just grab your phone, give a call ask for a reservation for 4 (you'll find the 3 others I promise! And they'll be grateful you did) and be ready for a 50$ gargantuesque heaven.  That's it. Just call now. You won't regret it...oh well, unless you are vegetarian ;)  ps: if you can't get there, call throughout the year, they sometimes get cancelation, sometimes, very few, but worth a try...  Bonne chance, et bon appÃ©tit!"}
{"text":"I had my reservations with Au Pied de Cochon once I read the yelp! reviews.  Why, you might ask?  Well, when any restaurant has an army of cheerleaders behind it, it worries me.  While I do like a good recommendation, I often take a pause when I hear \"go here or else you will never be happy again!\"  Ok, I ad lib'd that part.  In regards to the restaurant, we found it quite nice, and the service friendly.  However, I must agree with another reviewer that the balance of the dishes was, well, missing.  For instance, the menu, by first impressions, does not leave one saying \"I have to have this, and this, and this.\"  While an attractive menu, one does not need a fatty Entree, a fatty main, and a fatty dessert.    We did start with a course of foie gras.  While it was creamy, the taste was rather stale, and as such, we wasted about $10.00 worth because we would not eat it.  It wasn't spoiled, but it just wasn't good.  We moved on to the main courses, I had the duck in mushroom sauce.  It was almost as if the chef said \"no, I will not salt this dish, no matter how much it calls for salt.\"  It was, in a word, bland.  The duck itself was nice, but the flavors did not call out to me.  For dessert, I tried the poached pear, as it was the \"lightest\" offering.  It was delicious, but not enough for me to remember my meal at apdc fondly.   Alas, I came, I ate, and I'm not returning."}
{"text":"Excellente expÃ©rience! C'est ma 4ieme fois a la cabane Ã  sucre au pied du cochon et je n'ai jamais Ã©tÃ© dÃ©Ã§u!! Cour de coeur pour leur foie gras toujours bien prÃ©parÃ©"}
{"text":"A Montreal must. The convivial atmosphere and spectacular food made for a special dinner. We could have eaten anything on the menu, but ordered all specials, which I recommend: steamed buns with pork and shrimp served with soy and the restaurant's sugar shack maple syrup; a plate of charcuterie also made at the sugar shack (with out of this world chorizo and the first headcheese we ever tried, which was very good); foie gras grilled cheese; and halibut served with fiddleheads and asparagus, an onion and bacon ragout, and hollandaise. All amazing. We didn't have room for dessert, so our waiter gifted us with a shot of apple brandy, which he did with us. What a dinner. What a party. We will come back to Montreal for a number of reasons, but eating here is at the top of the list."}
{"text":"Wowzer! This food blew me away while anchoring me to my seat being so heavy and rich.  Went on Saturday night without reservation but flying solo so easily got a seat at the bar.  Did not realize til later that this place was brainchild of Martin Picard, same guy doing amazing things at M. Wells in NYC which I recommend you check out as well. Round one was the fois gras poutine which everyone raves about. The experience was like swimming in a pool of fois GRAS  gravy with chunks of fois gras and cheese curds floating around you. Inhaled that bad boy without thinking that I had an entree coming...ugh. Round two was the duck in a can which was pretty good. I actually enjoyed the vegetable and sauces that accompanied the duck more than the duck itself but it does not shave points off the oveall experience.  Come prepared with elastic pants or ready access to your top pants button. Thank you ADPC, now roll me home!"}
{"text":"A week and a half in advance, I made a reservation at PCD, to be seated at the Sunday 10pm seating.  Arriving exactly on time, and eager to finally have dinner, we waited 50 minutes to be seated, with the hostess apologizing profusely.    After providing appetizers and wine, we decided upon the foie gras poutine, which was amazing!  So eager were we to have poutine in Montreal, we decided that PCD would be the most unique place for poutine.  We then shared the duck in a can.  It was delicious.    I will likely not forget this meal, ever!  Everything, including the service was unforgettable, even though we were seated late.  The only regret was that we were so full after dinner, that we had trouble sleeping that night.  :). Next time, we will make reservations much more in advance!"}
{"text":"ExpÃ©rience incroyable, nourriture dÃ©cadente.  Il ne faut surtout pas s'attendre Ã  la traditionnelle cabane Ã  sucre.  L'acceuil et le service sont trÃ¨s bien et le personel est aimable.  La nourriture est abondante et excellente.  TrÃ¨s gras par contre mais c'Ã©tait Ã  prÃ©voir.  La tourtiÃ¨re vaut la peine de payer l'extra. Le fait de pouvoir se faire des plats take-out est fort apprÃ©cier. J'ai adorÃ© AmÃ©lioration pour l'avenir: une caisse pour payer n'est vraiment pas suffissant... surtout que les factures arrivent presqu'en mÃªme temps pour tout le monde dans la cabane. J'ai trouvÃ© que nous nous sentions pressÃ© pendant le repas... style manger vite car il faut dÃ©servir pour le prochain groupe.  Une chose que j'aurais aimÃ© est de pouvoir obtenir le descriptif du menu Ã  la fin pour que je puisse me souvenir de ce que nous avons mangÃ©.  Il y a tellement d'ingrÃ©dients, que je me souviens mÃªme plus de la composition de plusieurs plats.  Si quelqu'un me demande qu'est-ce qu'elle a d'extraordinaire la tourtiÃ¨re... je ne peux que rÃ©pondre... \"Elle a de la viande, du fromage et de la pÃ¢te\"... sachant trÃ¨s bien que c'est beaucoup plus que Ã§a."}
{"text":"An absolute must if visiting Montreal. These folks have such passion for what they do. From the appetizers to the desserts the food is awesome and our experience with the service has been great.  One thing to keep in mind is that some items take 30-40 mins to cook in the wood fired oven i.e the pdc chop the biggest best pork chop you'll ever have. I would also recommend the melting pot a tasting of boudin noir, pork sausage, chop, and shoulder over creamy mashed potatoes a meal for one or we get as an app to get all our favorites in one dish.  Only downside like all restaurants in this area parking is a bit hard to come by, expect a few blocks walk from the main street."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.  This was a recommendation by two friends as I headed into Montreal for weekend getaway. We didn't realize the reservations were a must but were very lucky that the hostess was able to seat us for a table for 3 on a Saturday night. Total fluke. Great atmosphere and a gorgeous summer night in April. The resaurant's front was completely opened which allowed light breeze and created a lovely backdrop for dinner. It's a quality restaurant that could easily be pretentious but doesn't carry itself to be that way at all.   As recommended by bloggers and yelp reviews, foie gras poutine and duck in a can were a must. Sometimes you wonder if it's hype or buzz  but truly this is so worth it. Foie gras poutine - thick cut fries, foie gras, cheese curds and gravy. Best poutine EVER! The flavour of each of these ingredients stands out on it's own but compliment each other well. I've been trying to go dairy free; it's moments like this where I realize how much I love cheese and where I kick myself for giving it up. It's an appetizer, so a smaller portion; great for sharing. Makes sense though given the generosity of the entree portions. My two girlfriends' ordered starter salads and were dismayed at how big they were.  DUCK-IN-A-CAN gets a paragraph for itself. Duck is my favourite and cooking it in a can was the best thing that could have happened to it. Picture a generous portion of duck breast with its fatty skin in a can. It keeps all of its flavour and fatty juices contained, also soaking up the flavours from cabbage, foie gras, thyme and sauces. They bring it out and open the can at your table, pouring it over toasted bread and mashed potatoes. It sounds simple, but it's anything but. I don't even think I participated in conversation for about 10-15 minutes. My friends were talking to me and I was in hazy bliss.  I cannot express how much I enjoyed this meal and how devasted I was when something so yummy had to end. As I stated that night, I could have gone for a second round of duck in a can.  Next time I go to Montreal, I will be making a reservation immediately after I book my plane ticket."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. It's glorifies junk food and both of us left sick because of the richness of the fat on our plates.  I would never go again and warn everyone who speaks of it."}
{"text":"Just not worth it. There are so many better restaurants in Montreal. Nothing went well.  We were told that No table available at reserved time, even though there were several obviously empty.  We were offer seats at the bar. I suspect that we were given these as we were from out of town. The hostess thought that I could not understand French. The waiter ignored us for 15 minutes before taking our order. She delayed entering the order so our food was further delayed. The head chef who was working the line directly in front of us apologized for the delay. Then there is the food.  Read the other reviews carefully. Heavy flavors that are totally unbalanced. 1-star is awarded for the excellent wine list. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Overrated, too loud, too crowded.  Waited 45 minutes after reservation time.  Foie gras poutine good, but , ordered half order and got about 10 french fries.  Ordered casoulet special.  It came with lots of beans, 2 pieces of bacon and an overcooked duck drumstick.  Very bland taste.  My wife makes a better one.  Wine by the glass gets you about a third of a glass of wine.  Waiter kept bumping the table to get to the large party behind us.  Really ruined our anniversary dinner.  Ate at Holder in old Montreal the night before and contrast was like night and day.  Asked them to get us a cab after dinner and they said just go out on the street and wait.  Ugg, what a night."}
{"text":"Truly unique dining experience. If you're on Weight Watchers, cancel your subscription right now, since this will probably blow through about a year's worth of points in one shot.  Duck in a can is great but not my favourite, though the presentation is cool. Absolutely get the fois gras poutine, but be sure to have your cardiologist on speed dial first. Try the blue cheese/apple/endive or the beet/goat cheese salad - ithey are delicious, and will make you feel slightly less guilty about everything else you've ordered. And make reservations in advance, especially if you plan on going on a weekend."}
{"text":"Too hyped, too heavy, too much attitude. We had high expectations for Au Pied Du Cochon, which is considered one of the best culinary experiences in Montreal.  First, the hostess was rude - we asked to be seated early, to which she responded \"not even a minute.\"  Noisy, crowded - not a pleasurable dining environment.  The menu is also very limited - half pork, half foie gras.  The portions are too big and everything is over the top - no subtlety.  The beef rib was delicious, however...no complaints there.  For a great traditional French meal with ambiance, try L'Express...for top notch food, Lameac."}
{"text":"Tried so many times to eat here.  Finally made a few months ago.  We were seated in the rear and right up against the wall-a little uncomfortable.  That was the only negative.  House beer was really good, I mean really good.  Onion soup was good but too much cheese for me.  I had duck in can which was very flavorful.  On top of the perfectly made mashed potatoes,  the duck juice tasted sinful.  With so many great restaurants to try in Montreal, it will be while before I go back.  I really enjoyed the night and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"After visiting Au Pied De Cochon, I love anything foie gras.  DInner here was the highlight of our trip at Montreal.  We made reservations months in advance based on A Bourdain's stellar review.  I must say, the food is very rich and unlike anything I have ever had.  You know when you have had something so great it left you speechless, well this was it!  We had a large group so we ordered everything off the menu and shared.  Everything was fantastic, so I will review the highlights of my meal!  Duck in a can-ingenious, how they stuff a duck in a can, close the lid off and cook it in the can.  The waiter then opens up the can in front of you and displays it on the plate.  Juicy, packing tons of flavor!  Pig's feet with foie gras.  Meat was unbelievably tender, mixed with foie gras, over a bed of potatoes.  This plate is enormous, so it can definitely be shared.  A must try!  I still think about it to this day!    Possibly one of the best meals I have ever had, no doubt at all!   Bourdain definitely hit the spot on this place!  I would visit Montreal just to eat at APDC!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the most well known restaurant in mtl...  My romance with au pied de cochon started in 2005. I went because i read in the gazette that their dish won the most original dish that year: duck in a can!!!  Duck in a can !?! WTH? ok let's try it...  Then I came ordered Duck in a can, couldn't finish the damn thing it was so huge... but it was good, no i mean, it was evil good, you know like pee in the pool good... you know you're being naughty but it feels nice :)  definitely an impressive dish served at the table, they open it and dump it out in front of you, then you eat it and you're like damn it good too? on top of the mini show...what a cool dish  The thing with au pied de cochon is, the food looks like a mess and it looks like it could induce an instant heart attack. And the first few times i came here, i fell to the fat coma... you know when you've eaten too much fatty stuff, it's too rich, you get this feeling where you're about to hurl, yep i've been there. that's because I just ate too much...but it was just too good to stop.  Word to the wise, if you come here don't finish your food, doggy bag it.  Then i discovered the foie gras menu!!!   let me just say, \"ploque de Champlain\" is just the most original foie gras dish ever!!! pan cake, potato slices, bacon foie gras seared and maple syrup, yeah can't say i thought of that... but it makes a carzy evil dish, killer, really killer.  Then there's the foie gras burger, like a burger with seared foie gras sun dried tomatoes and balsamic vinegar, yummy.  And of course the Poutine au foie gras, not only is foie gras in the sauce, the whole thing is topped of with a piece of seared foie gras. i'm not a fan of poutine, but this I like.  Happy pork chop, another winner, bison ribs!!! the best. This place is famous for the foie gras, but it's a deep menu with many excellent dishes if you care to explore.  If you come here don't eat with your eyes, eat with your taste buds. the plating is very rustic, but the taste is always good. except a few times when the cook gets a little heavy handed with the salt."}
{"text":"It was what we ordered but our meal here was a disappointment.  We started with a seafood platter which was pretty solid.  We also had the poutine with the fois gras.  I am sorry but none of it worked for us and it was borderline tough to stomach, especially when it gets cold.  There is no balance in the dish and the salty gravy and the plastic cheese pretty much ruins perfectly good fois gras.    Some of my favorite restaurants are pork centric like this one.  I was envious of the dishes at the nearby tables which were more conventional meat or pork dishes.  If there is a next time, I'd like to try those dishes instead."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences of my life. I want to move to Montreal just so I can try everything they have to offer.   I know, dramatic. But hear me out.  My bf and I arrived on a Thursday night in mid October. This meal was 1 month in advance, so the anticipation was real.   We were seated in the front of the eatery, between a party of four and another party of two. the party of four ordered the pigs head-it looked and smelled glorious. The party of two ordered ducks in cans and they proclaimed it was the best duck they had in their life. This order couple also gave me some serious relationship goals. For the last 10 years, every year, they drive 7 hours from Philly to vacation in Montreal and to eat at Au Pied. I was blown away by their tenacity.   Finally our meal arrived.   #1-bison tongue:  very tender and had a blast of flavor. I could have eaten 10 of those appetizers.  #2-Foie Gras cromesquis:  I didnt know something so small could pack so much wonderful fatty liver flavor in it. It was smooth and silky and no trace of metal or game. divine.   #3. stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras:  the headliner of our meal was a absolute knockout. The gravy was oozing with veggie aromatics and sweet pork essence. The leg had crispy skin sitting on top of thick garlic mash potatoes. The veggies swimming in the gravy soaked up all the flavors. The meat was fall off the bone and tender AF. The foie gras was perfectly seared and buttery. We ate 3/4 of the dish and had a heavy lunch the next day :D  #4. Pecan pie with vanilla ice cream: I never had pecan pie like this before. The pecans were crispy but not overcooked. The filling was beeming with butterscotch and spices. It was not too sweet where your gums would melt. it was the perfect balance of sweetness and nutty aromatics. Not to the mention that the vanilla ice cream was made 3 feet away from me and I saw the whole vanilla bean go in. Who does that anymore?!  The house bread is very light, buttery and perfect for mopping up all the sauces.  The service is incredible. Even though it was a full house and the noise levels were thru the roof, my food connoisseur was very attentive and did not miss a beat! I will come back to Au Pied again (and again) and bring friends so we can tackle the head dish."}
{"text":"We had heard about PDC and were prepared to be skeptical. However, the restaurant FAR exceeded our expectations and was good value to boot!  First let's start with the service.  There has to be a higher wait-staff to customer ratio than any restaurant I have ever been in.  Also, they use a service system I had only experienced in much smaller cafes and such: you have a personal staffer in charge of your dinner, but whenever a dish or drink is ready, whoever is available brings it. This means dishes get to you quickly, fresh and hot. It also means that anyone can respond to your needs: you don't have to flag down \"your\" waiter for a question or request. Consequently, the service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very helpful, suggesting a daily special [a variety of sausages and head cheese] and cautioning against two orders of the Tarte de boudin.  So the partner had an hors d'oeuvre plate of  sausages, and I had a beet and goat cheese salad [Salade de betteraves et chÃ¨vre]. It was actually like a cold lasagne of beets and herbs and goat cheese. Excellent, almost a meal in itself.  The Tarte de boudin was amazing. Although it looked something like a small pizza, the crust was a delicate, flaky, pastry crust-- as tasty as i've had anywhere. in the \"topping\" mix were carmelized onions, mashed potatoes, and slices of the most delicious boudin. One order was more than enough for both of us, and there was no way we could have eaten dessert.   I had a glass of Bourgogne Aligote [no California wines here....] and the partner had a Cream Ale.   In total, our bill [with a very generous tip] was less than $60. [Canadian]."}
{"text":"I went here a few months back after must anticipation. I must say, it exceeded my expectations. I decided to write a review now because after dining at some praised restaurants in the past month (Origin in Toronto, Bazaar in L.A., ect) I can't sop thinking this one thing; remember how amazing the meal and experience was at Au pied de cochon in Montreal and it was only a fraction of the price of the mediocre meal I just at.   Thank you Au pied de cochon."}
{"text":"I LOOOOOOOOVE their Foie Gras poutine! My husband and I went there with a strong recommendation from our hotel concierge; he even got us a table last minute! Small cozy bistro with heavenly delicious food, not with fancy deco, but a sincere attitude toward the food. I admire them. The wine list is relatively short, but the guy who took our order (I think he is Phil) recommended a very good Burgundy to our poutine; It's not an expensive selection, but it was good match. Their service was also attentive; we never had to ask for something; their staff really took a good care of us! Excellent orchestrated piece!"}
{"text":"Just. Eat. Everything.  While this restaurant is the brainchild of Martin Picard and his gang of kitchen misfits, it is by far and large one of the tastier institutions on the Montreal food scene. While the menu is highly seasonal, the winter meals are warm and yummy. Lots of rich flavours and delicious meats. The summer menu features lighter fare, so those of you with very sensitive stomachs might be more likely to find a dish that suits your palate then. Excellent wine list, super friendly staff. Definitely somewhere you can take your friends, date-night, or in-laws. Might want to leave the kids at home though, unless they're into foiegras ;)"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in this restaurant. It was talked up so much before our trip to Montreal and I thought I was really going to enjoy it, sadly I found it mediocre. Service wasn't that great, waitress never stopped back to check up on us, and when we wanted to order more we had to speak to the food runner who said she would get our waitress who then took more then 5 mins to come over. It's also very loud in there, not great if you don't know the menu and have questions. Also there were a bunch of daily specials we didn't even know about. The menu has no descriptions so you have no idea what it is and what it's served with. Also we ordered the steamed buns and they were actually pretty gross. If you've ever had a real Taiwanese soup dumpling don't order cochon dumplings. We should have just saved room for dessert."}
{"text":"Is everyone serious with all the 4 and 5 star reviews?  More like \"Cochon Slop\" This place was one of the worse dining experiences i have ever encountered.  We had a 5 o'clock reservation and was promptly seated,  there were only 2 parties in the entire restaurant.  We ordered the poutine with foie gras as an appetizer,  it came out quickly but only semi warm.. the cheese was still hard.   For dinner me and my wife ordered the Duck in a can and the stuffed Pied de Cochon  w/ foie gras.  After an HOUR AND FIFTY MINUTES..... that's right no typo here , one hour and fifty minutes with nooooo apologies, our dinner arrives.  The waiter opens the duck in a can and out plops a huge pool of fat followed by a puny piece of duck with overcooked veggies, this was seriously inedible.  My pied de cochon was equally as bad.  Over cooked vegetables slathered with gravy over a giant pig foot.   Over hyped and over priced. Do yourself a favor and dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was lucky to squeeze a reservation. Food was amazing, especially foie gras dishes. Must try this restaurant if you stop by montreal. Make sure to call ahead to make a reservation"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious and gluttonous.  We had reservations for 9 pm on a Saturday night, and we didn't have to wait at all.   Restaurant was still full and bustling.  We sat along the wall by the bar, so we got to watch the kitchen in action, which was pretty cool.   Food is ridiculously good and bad for you.  But its so good that you won't even care.  We ordered:  -Foie Gras Cromesquis (fried balls filled with liquified foie gras.  Awesome) -Plogue Au Champlain (foie gras appetizer that will blow your mind--pancake, slice of boiled potato, canadian bacon, and melted cheddar, all topped with a large patty of seared foie gras, surrounded by maple syrup.  So.  Delicious.) -Tarragon Bison Tongue (amazing texture, cooked perfectly) -Happy Pork Chop (big, simple, and delicious) -PDC's Melting Pot (large pot filled with blood sausage, pork belly, and two other kinds of meat, sitting on top of a pile of mashed potatoes)  It was all really, really good.  Go in with a ready-to-eat mindset and you won't be disappointed.  Pants with an elastic waistband might be a good idea.  Oh, also, their house beer is pretty good and refreshing with pounds and pounds of foie gras and pork.  Service is good, too!  If it weren't for fears of clogged arteries we would've returned every night.  My only regret is not ordering the duck in a can.  Next time!"}
{"text":"Clearly gone downhill.  Will never return after being treated like garbage.  What disgusting combinations of food, and clearly intended to poke fun at us for being tourists in their eyes. Picard is way past his sell-by date"}
{"text":"A gander at the distribution of rave reviews on Yelp and a peek at the Anthony Bourdain video of this place convinced me that Au Pied de Cochon would be a memorable experience.  And oh, was it memorable.  Service was slow and perhaps more insultingly, indifferent; we continually had to flag different waitstaff down to get, variously, bread, drink, etc because our waitress was busy walking past us to get between her other tables and treated us as if we didn't exist. At the end of the meal, we successfully accosted her to ask for the check, and she promptly disappeared again for 30 minutes before we complained to someone who was equally indifferent to our plight but at least gave us the bill so that we could leave.  What was the true let-down, however, was the food. Knowing this place had a menu built on very fatty and rich foods, I thought I was prepared. I ordered the pied de cochon because, well, the place is called the pied de cochon. What arrived must have been a pied + an entire flank + slabs of duck liver + several onions drenched in sticks of butter de cochon, dumped unceremoniously in a giant deep dish. I entered into a very meta space in which I started wondering whether the volume of the food, if stuffed into a plastic bag, would exceed the volume of my head, and what the percentage weight of my own pied was to the weight of this pied. Concluding that I would surely win a Darwin award for dying from complications of gastric bypass surgery if I tried to down this dish (because this pied sure as hell was not going to bypass by itself), I took 4 bites and called it a -very disappointing- night.  And then the dilemma of what to do with the remains, which constituted a largely untouched dish. I considered dragging them home with me to make 10 gallons of stock, but since home is a 12 hour Amtrak ride away and my freezer really doesn't have that kind of spare capacity, I took a moment to apologize to the pig for a waste of a life, and said adios.  It is actually beyond my comprehension how one person could eat this dish. The sheer amount of food and fat transcends mere excess and enters into the realm of the grotesque. Perhaps my rating would be different if I had tried another dish...but alas I have zero incentive to return."}
{"text":"We had 2 dinners in Montreal. Here and Joe Beef. I would say Joe Beef had the better service but that is by no means a slight against the service at Cochon. It was fantastic but I guess Joe Beef is more of an experience. The food at Cochon wins the battle for me. Far more decadent and creative. I mean a lobster and foie gras sundae? A foie gras pizza? 2 of the most fun and fantastic things I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Also had a veal heart salad with morells, holy cow is that a perfect dish. Every aspect of the meal was incredible. Awesome house beers as well to go with the food. I had 2 fantastic meals in Montreal so bravo to this fine establishment and great city. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Like the other hundred 5 star reviews here, this is a must try when in Montreal.  Foie gras and duck in a can seem to be the most popular dishes. Both are excellent and it's unlikely you will taste anything like it again.  The only thing I would like to add is that if you want to make it an interesting experience you may want to sit at the bar right in front of the kitchen. It is clearly much louder, but you are able to see how each dish is prepared.  Reservations are a must, however, if you do forget to make reservations just go there as soon as they open at 5pm and ask if you can eat at the bar. It does work."}
{"text":"I decided to go to this restaurant for my birthday, expecting eating a lot, i invited my little brother. we sat at the bar, and everyone was welcoming us. The waitress the whole time was really helpful. We decided to go for Bison Temaki, it was delicious and was served like a Maki Roll and the Bison Tongue, that was also tasty and perfectly cooked. The Girl said we should get the Melting Pot PDC, it was one of my favorite meals, was Maple Syrup and 100g of foie gras!! then we had the Foie Gras Poutine, also really good, one of the best i had. I really love Boudin, so i had to take the Boudin home made Tart. was delicious! Finally we decide take the special Veal. pefectly cooked and nice portion. We were so full!! and decide to share a dessert, Poached Pear, it was not too sweet.   Everything was good, the service was nice too. The food was delicious just maybe too much salty for me, probably not because they add salt but the foie gras is already heavy in salt. other than that was a great experience, but i dont think i will come back , or maybe once a year...i rather go somewhere to eat as good and have more personality into the service, if you pay 200$ for 2 persons i would like to have better service. some other place we would have free shots or free dessert, like i was celebrating my bday.   but i would recommand this place if you want have the best foie gras or great pork.  :)"}
{"text":"Trip to Montreal is never complete without a visit to this temple of Foie Gras.   I normally save this place for my last whenever I visit the city because if you were to begin your stay eating here with its Caligula style orgy of pure, filthy (in a good way), no holds barred gluttony and excess in action, you're guaranteed an anti-climax.   Save it for your last because this place will uniquely overwhelm you.  First time I came here many years ago I left thoroughly impressed with what I call bucket list approach to chef Picard and his devoted brigade's cooking.   It's Tony Mantana sniffing palm full of coke with grenade gun blazin' type of attitude and execution here.     Sit at the choice kitchen bar seats, buckle up and enjoy the controlled chaos and spectacle of gluttony that is Au pied de Cochon.   Be sure to leave your vegan friends back at the hotel.  Just let yourself go.  You'll understand."}
{"text":"I was so happy I went here. The food was excellent, the waitstaff were absolute professionals, and the cost was much less than it could have been given the quality and the atmosphere of the place.  Get a reservation. I'll be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"If you're not into food. Don't go here. If you adore food, you must eat here now!  Some framework: I've eaten at L'espalier in Boston, love martini's at the Ritz in Central Park South NYC and appreciate Buffs Pub in Newton, MA. It doesn't always need to be fine food, but it needs to be good food and cooked properly. Anything less- send it back and leave...ok....  THE BAR AND KITCHEN We sat at the bar (as requested). Overlooking the kitchen. Watching them prepare, without fail, dish after dish. Heating every plate, food going out STEAMING hot. Kitchen moving fast and efficient. It is a well run kitchen.  ATMOSPHERE The atmosphere is loud and casual. it's energetic and fun. It's small and tight.  FOOD AND DRINKS The drinks were yummy. We ordered the specials, mojitos and maple daqueris. Finely done.  We ordered lots of foie gras in various forms. It was cooked to perfection. Tender. The hand made bread= amazing! Perfect outside crackle to it. Dense. Perfect.  At the recommendation of the sous chef, we had the halibut for dinner, which was cooked to perfection. Rich sauce.  The food is rich and decadent, but absolutely worth it.   One of the best meals I have EVER eaten. I highly recommend this place. 100%. If you have ONE place to go in Montreal. This is it! :)"}
{"text":"Service is outstanding. The employees are so attentive and seem to really love their jobs. Food it also outstanding and some of the best I have had in Montreal. I will say the food is really heavy and I don't want to think about the fat and calories. You'll probably walk out having eaten 2000 calories and well over 50 grams of fat, per person. Then again, if you really care about that stuff, subways right around the corner.   Treat yourself, check it out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mind bogglingly fantastic down home French food. Duck in a Can might be my new favorite dish. Anything with Foie Gras on the menu will blow your mind. Not a low calorie meal. Get ready for a serious food coma after, but completely worth it."}
{"text":"Had the duck in a can-not as tasty as I had hoped for, but good. An unexpected standout was a pickled herring appetizer-not something you would expect in this monument to pork and foie gras, but the best i've ever had-and a light, subtle counterpoint to most everything else. Sat at the bar and had very good service ta boot. Nice people here."}
{"text":"BEWARE AMERICANS!!!  I have never, ever in my life been treated as rudely as I was at Au Pied de cochon.   My friend and I cabbed all the way from our hotel in Vieux Port to try this raved about restaurant. Hurricane Irene hit hard while we were en route, so the rain was the definition of torrential. The time we arrived was 4:54, and when we tried the door in the pouring rain (=no coverage or overhang) the door was locked. The waitress pointed at her watch and gestured the number 5, to signal to us that no, she would not be opening the door for us to come in out of the rain for at least another 5 minutes. Wow.   We should have left then, but decided to give it a shot and wait under an overhang down the street. 4 minutes later when we came back, we walked in to what looked like a very nice restaurant. We asked for a table and the hostess asked us if we had a reservation.   The restaurant was literally empty, save for the staff whom were basically just watching us. She said: \"oh, sorry we are booked tonight.\" Naturally, we laughed and looked around figuring she was joking. When her grimace failed to lighten we said \"Seriously? There is no one here!\" The manager then stepped over and confirmed that sorry, they were all booked for the night. Keep in mind there is literally no one in the restaurant, and it's Hurricane Irene outside. Is your blood pressure going up yet? Mine was....  But I maintained composure and tried again. I said, \"oh man, we are so bummed - we just cabbed from Vieux Port all the way up here because it sounded so good (from YELP reviews, of course). He pursed his lips, shrugged his shoulders, and motioned for the door.   I felt like I was being kicked out as I opened the door and we stepped back out into the pouring rain. As we walked away he yelled as an afterthought that if we wanted to leave a phone number he would call us in the event of a cancellation. At this point he was just being snide, and all I wanted to do was give him the finger. I wish I had but we were already so wet that we put our tails between our legs and just kept going.  Now, the reason I started this post with Beware Americans, is because there is no doubt we were being discriminated against as Americans. I say this having lived in Montreal for 5 years while attending McGill University. I love Canada and actually believe it to be a far more well balanced and sound country (albeit a little conservative) than the US. While I lived here I came to realize that there are certain people who really can't stand Americans; mostly due to our foreign policies. So there is some discrimination in this town.   But discrimination like this I have never experienced before, so I write this warning so that hopefully no one will have to feel as demoralized as we felt leaving this restaurant.  We ended up at one of my old haunts, L'Entrecote St. Jean on Peel, which was delicious. Go there instead!"}
{"text":"We loved this place so much last year, so we planned another trip back just to go again. This time around, I ordered the Plogue a Champlain. What's a plogue? I had no idea, it's not a Celtic rock band, nor a disease spread by vermin, and the menu omits any description whatsoever. Turns out, it's Quebecois French slang, meaning \"plug,\" as in this dish could clog Lake Champlain. It consists of a pancake bottom layer, topped with potatoes, bacon, melted cheddar, and seared foie gras with a maple syrup sauce. All of the richness just oozes and drips down, soaking into the pancake. Each bite was dense with delicious duck fat, bacon fat, and butter. Thankfully, the portion size was manageable, or else I would have had needed stat angioplasty in the dining room. I had it as my main course, but it could easily be shared as a starter for two. Now I can't wait to go back to try more of the menu. One tip: even if you can't get a reservation, you may have a chance getting a table if there's a no show, or just opt to sit at the bar and watch the cooks at work in the open kitchen."}
{"text":"We came for the sugar shack dinner experience.  Decor, the place is interesting.  There isn't anything fancy to it, just rows of tables and benches to sit on.  You may be seated with strangers depending on the size of your group so do keep that in mind.  It is not quiet here, so don't expect to have a nice meal with your date here.  Service, this can be a bit on/off depending on how busy it gets because it does get quite busy.  You can easily flag down anyone if you need anything since everyone was fairly helpful.  Do note that some of the wait staff don't speak a lot of English, so do understand that when they don't understand what you say or when they try to explain the dishes to their abilities.  Food, this is the biggest meal that I have had.  It is divided into 4 courses with anywhere between 2-4 dishes each, so do pace yourself even though there is plenty of food left over.  I found that while I did not like everything I had, the ones I did like, I liked a lot.  Overall, the dish course was my favourite, but you can't really go wrong with any of the other courses.  Here is what I remember, sweet & sour soup with dumplings, pasta, omelette with tongue, cake with maple syrup and foie gras, pig face with donuts and fennel salad, duck with squid ink and stuffed calamari, rabbit stuffed with foie gras, maple taffy, maple and pineapple ice cream with beaver tails, maple cotton candy milk shooters with baklava and lemon souffle.  Price, I thought the price was actually really good for the amount of food and the quality of ingredients that you get.  Mind you, it depends on the person but I thought $65 + tax/tip for what we got was well worth it.  I wouldn't have a problem recommending people to come to try it, but I don't think I would be making a trip out to try this again."}
{"text":"I had just landed in Montreal and looking for a good restaurant. Au pied de cochon had the best reviews so I decided to go there. I was not disappointed. Of course, you have to like meat. But assuming you do, that's a great place to eat.  I didn't have a reservation. so on a Saturday evening it was not easy to get in. But I was alone so I could sit at the bar. Right in front of the open kitchen. It was rather hectic (don't go there if you want a quiet dinner) but it had a great vibe. All waiters were friendly and very knowledgeable. And the food was awesome. I had the pickled tongue and the CÃ´te du cochon heureux (happy pig's rib) with a couple pints of their own brew. Everything was great and everything else I saw looked delicious. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experience of my entire life.  We were a group of 4 people with a reservation at 930pm, called in a month in advance. We arrive there at 915, and the hostess tells us that we're early and to wait outside. She says that she will come get us when our table is ready. So we go outside and wait. 9:30pm passes and 9:45pm comes, and we're wondering if she forgot about us. So I go inside and ask if our table is ready, and the hostess says 5 more minutes, they are clearing our table. Knowing that this is a busy restaurant, I give them some room and return outside to wait.  During that time, other groups of 4 people who arrive after us are getting seated. I go back to talk to the hostess and ask what's going on, and she replies that these people arrived before us so they had priority??? So you're telling us we're early when we arrive at 9:15pm, then tell us that people who arrive after us are getting priority??? By that time, we just wanted to leave, but because we heard so many great things about au Pied de Cochon, we decided that we wanted to try the food anyways.  So by that time, its around 9:55pm and we're still waiting outside. The hostess comes back outside and says that unfortunately our table is still not ready because the current occupants \"just started dessert\". WHY DID YOU TELL US at 9:45pm that our table was getting cleared and would be ready in 5 minutes?? She apologized and gave us free beers, which we really didn't care about. We were hungry and wanted to eat. Also because we had beers in our hands, we had to wait inside in the hallway, which is super tiny with lots of people trying to get in and out. While standing in the hall, I get to see the reservation list and see that all people who had a reservation at 930p had been crossed out( which means seated) except us, and people from 10pm had been crossed out too. What is going on here?  We finally get seated at 10:15pm (a whole 45 minutes after our reservation), and we're all mad and starving. The waitress comes and finally gets our order, and we finally think that our troubles will be over, and that we're ready to drink and eat. One of the waiter brings over a plate of cod fritters that one of us ordered, and clumsily drops 2 fritters on the table while trying to set the plate down. Instead of offering to replace them, he simply mumbles \"Oh sorry\" then leaves. EXCUSE ME? Is this real? One of my friend is livid and starts to yell, and our original waitress comes by and asks if everything's all right. My friend explains to her what happened and she offers to replace them at free of charge ( a big 6$ in comped food right there).   Also, when she took our order, one of us ordered a pale ale and she completely forgets about it. We had to remind her, and she says nobody ordered it from her. After telling her again that we ordered it, she says: oh yeah I forgot and then brings the beer 20 minutes after it was ordered. Is this serious?  They finally bring us the food:  Appetizer Foie gras poutine: Awesome. I can see why au pied de cochon became famous because of this plate. The fries are perfectly cooked, the cheese is chewy and tasty, the sauce is incredibly flavorful, and the foie gras just adds to the richness of the plate  (For some reason, they brought us bread after we finished the poutine. I thought bread was supposed to be served at the beginning of the meal...)  Main dishes:  Foie gras hamburger: Very average. The foie gras itself is bigger than the meat patty which isn't that big to begin with, and overpowers the entire burger  Duck in a can: Good, but doesn't come close to being as good as advertised. There's an overload of cabbage in the dish, and the duck meat is undercooked  Magret de canard: Bland, nothing special. Friend who took this commented on the lack of any flavors.  Pieds de cochon with foie gras: Mixture of fatty pieces of pig feet with sauce. There is no way anybody could take more than 4 bites of this without being sick of the richness of this dish.   After we finished our meal, we were all fed up with this experience. We just paid and left with a very bitter taste.  Overall, I was very disappoointed with Au pied de cochon. Having driven all the way from Philadelphia to Montreal, and having heard many great things about this restaurant from food critics to friends and family, I had very high expectations for this. The horrible customer service just overpowers any potential to have an acceptable dining experience here. The food is ok. I understand the concept of this restaurant which is fat/richness/heavy food on top of fat/richness/heavy food, but there are so many better options out there in a great foodie city like Montreal.   I will NEVER EVER come back here again"}
{"text":"cuisine de tradition quÃ©bÃ©coise, avec des touches franÃ§aises ( logique), un restaurant trÃ¨s sympathique pour un dÃ©jeuner entre amis.

{"text":"OMG!! 1 of the best meals I've ever had. The duck carpaccio was phenomenal... it's hard to describe the melt in your mouth texture and with the egg yolk smothered all over it, it was heavenly. The foie gras poutine - I'd prefer the fries to be a bit thicker-cut, and the cheese curds to be more melted. But what can go wrong with foie gras, french fries and gravy?! The portion was just right for 2 of us to share and feel satisfied without the greasy feeling. Finally, we had the PDC (pied de cochon) to share. We did not order the one which is stuffed with foie gras as that would be FG-OD. This dish was huge! The pork knuckle was exactly how I liked it to be... so soft and tender the meat is falling off the bone.. and the sauce which comes with it was sooo good. It comes with a side of mashed potato with cheese whipped in it. We left VERY happy and I wished I can come back here everyday to try EVERYTHING on the menu..."}
{"text":"Cabane a Sucre  Having never enjoyed going to a Cabane a  Sucre or the food served there I was ready to be swayed. A different twist on Cabane food but conceptually the same. Gluttony gone overbord. What restaurant starts by giving you a doggy bag? And what would you do with it once you got it home? Once you sit the food arrives in quantity with no stop. Just enough time to shovel it into mouth and take out container. After the mains it was straight to the dumpster with the leftovers. Shame for such waste. A day later I can't remember one dish I enjoyed except perhaps the oysters. There must be reason I've never gone back to the Pied de Couchon in Montreal. This place is worth a try just to experience it . Just can't guarantee you will enjoy the experience. Wine at 50 plus a bottle was plonk.Fotunately there are only 4 or 5. Go straight to the hundred dollar plus bottles.Maybe better."}
{"text":"Je suis allÃ©e deux fois: une fois en amoureux et une fois avec une amie. Deux belles expÃ©riences!  La bouffe est excellente, mais il faut aimer la viande et Ãªtre ouvert Ã  quelque chose de riche, mais Ã´ combien succulent!  Avec mon amie, nous n'aimions pas vraiment le vin que nous avions commandÃ©. Nous pensions qu'il Ã©tait bouchonnÃ©, le sommelier y a goÃ»ter pour nous et il nous a confirmÃ© que ce vin avait ce goÃ»t... Mais, sans aucuns problÃ¨mes il nous a offert de remplacer la bouteille pour autre chose, de ne pas s'en faire et que ce serait dommage de ne pas apprÃ©ciÃ© le vin. AprÃ¨s une petite rÃ©flexion teintÃ©e de culpabilitÃ© et de dÃ©ception, nous avons remplacÃ© notre bouteille et elle nous a Ã©tÃ© servi avec le sourire.  Service et expÃ©rience exceptionnel, j'y retourne dÃ¨s que possible!"}
{"text":"It hurts me to do this...it really does, because I have worked in this industry and looked forward to this dinner with friends... and they shit the bed on every level. From the taking of the the reservation to the food we ate and didn't eat - it was a disaster.   (Full disclosure, I visited Au Pied last year - and put off doing this for so long because I wanted to see if time would dull the disappointment. It didn't)  To preface this - we were a pretty easy going group. So easy going that when my friend sat down and the huge glob of butter that was hanging off the edge of the poorly wiped table smeared onto her black dress - we laughed it off. When they didn't have the wine we ordered - no big deal, we'll order another. When the carpaccio was drown in olive oil so you couldn't taste the meat - oh well - it will get better.  It didn't.   In an attempt to appease the fine dining gods, we put ourselves into our harried servers' hands (who later admitted \"I wasn't very good\") and ordered the specials he misrepresented. The fondue was inedible, which we brought to their attention and they confirmed that far too much rind was put in the cheese making it taste like dirt. We agreed...and they left it on the table. And didn't take it off the bill until I told the waiter that he can make us pay for food we didn't eat but that would really affect his tip. After some discussion they took it off and we left.  This was a restaurant that was riding on it's reputation and couldn't take a reso or clean a table or even make a fucking fondue properly.   Oh well, I hear Joe Beef is good."}
{"text":"Taxi dropped us off at the front door.  This restaurant is pretentious enough to have no signage, just a number on a simple door.  A narrow entry led us to a cramped hostess station, next to a tank of swimming eels.  So far so good.  A very enthusiastic waiter came and read off about ten specials, including tripe, eel as main course or appetizer, veal kidneys, liver ...... in addition to their regular menu.  Now I am salivating.  Got to have some foie gras.  They have 5 preparations and the waiter recommend the apple sauce.  This dish can best be described as an open face cheese foie gras burger, drowning in a heavy apple reduction of some sort.  It is so over powering that they could have put anything below and all you can taste is the sweet sauce.  We ended up scrapping away all the brown gooey stuff and it still overwhelms the foie gras underneath.  Then comes the eel.  Eel is delicate, sweet but bony.  It was baked/broiled with a slightly sweet glaze - perfect.  But they serve them over a bed of mash potatoes and gravy.  Now as you dig into the bony sweet eel, it got mixed into the pool of creamy mashed potatoes.  The flavor, the texture, the fine fish bones blended into one mess that is almost impossible to eat.  Try digging fish bones out of mashed potatoes.  The coup de grÃ¢ce was the fried sturgeon.  Three gigantic pieces came in a huge cone filled with French fries underneath.  Two pieces were of the normal golden fish and chips color while the third is dark brown.  We thought it was interesting that they would have two different batters for one dish.  Digging into it, we found the brown piece was simply a twice-cooked piece from a previous batch.  The brown was simply burnt batter.  The fish was old, strong smelling, dry and over cooked, especially the burnt piece.  The restaurant was packed for a Thurs night.  Its popularity obviously have little to do with food."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this place. The decor is warm and cozy, the staff are attentive and know A LOT about the menu and what would satisfy our palettes. Our group of 5 are not the most adventerous eaters but were definitely open to what the waiter suggested and we LOVED everything he recommended. The dishes ordered were the beef tartare, bison rib, pork chops, cod fritters yum yum yum, we got very lucky someone canceled their reservation because we walked in and got seated right away, yay must try!"}
{"text":"Wow... Buckle up kids. I'm gonna let you sit front seat for a journey through the worst service I've EVER had. From start to finish. Tighten up.   Preface: I own a small wholesale pasta company in California. (It costs me more to run than I make) I'm not bragging. I make my paycheck working 50-60 hours a week in another restaurant. I take a lot of pride in my work there as a pastry chef. I don't make a lot of money. I DO invest heavily on where I spend it. And here I am. In Montreal. The most beautiful and fantastic city I've ever been to. (Seriously... Well done civil engineers)  I call a month before my trip. (For my 30th birthday) and instead of calling the number I left on the answering machine, they call the number I  used to make the call which was the restaurant I work at. After a frustrating (although hilarious) interaction of two different restaurant hostesses not knowing they're taking to anther restaurant. I confirmed my reservation.   So we arrived. 15 minutes to spare. Thank you Opus card.  \"Bonjour, avez-vous une rÃ©servation\"  \"Oui,\" I said with fear. (Knowing there would be a follow up question in French and I just exhausted the extent of my French vocabularie. Why couldn't she have started in Spanish. I would have had a chance then.) Well, now I've been outed. No problem she speak very good English.  And... It turns out I don't have a [recorded] reservation... B-effing-S. 20 minute wait. Well I've already come across the continent, I'll just be patient.  Boom. We're sat. We got a beer and a wine, and we order a couple things to start.  Then she returns to finish our order and we order Au Pied de Coichon with foie.  First, Bison Tongue comes. Done. Fantastic.  Second, Dumplings come. 6 for 12$, or 12 for 24$. I got twice as many as I ordered but I understand the mix up. Maybe my fault maybe hers. But we can split the difference. They were fantastic.  And now comes the main event.... Any minute now..................  (sigh).........  She returns... She notified us it'll be here shortly 10-15 minutes. (The seed of frustration has be planted.) \"What?!\" I look around and think to myself, \"I was here well before that 4 top over there was even sat. And they've got multiple courses. They're all happily eating their main entrees. And this two top directly next to me was sat at least 30 minutes behind me and they're almost done.\" (My frustration seed is budding with impatience.)  After an excruciating period of being ignored by our server. She was really good at that. We'll call her Matthrine with a C. I stop her and ask her very politely. \"Will our food be much longer?\" She \"promises\" it'll be \"right out\" whatever that means.   45 f@$k!4G minutes later we get our 1 entree. The manager himself dropped it off. He rectified, \"I'm sorry for the wait. (Blah Blah) I'll take care of this.\" I smile. I literally don't want this. I didn't want this a while ago. I would have gladly shot this dying horse 30 minutes ago and just parted ways. But no. You ignored me and \"tried\" to make it right. Now we're all in this mess together.  The pig foot is here, just eat. Thank god. At least the kitchen is worth the hype. Well done.   So now here we are. I'm done. I've given up. I'm exhausted. I literally have to pay more money than it's worth to be as angry as I am right now. So I ask for a check. And a new problem. Our server informs us she was going to send out a dessert. I felt confused. I've never been in a place where I wanted to refuse a free dessert. I just want to go back to my hotel room and conclude my birthday on or around the toilet like I do every year. She walks away. Well, I grabbed her attention seconds after that exchange and just ask for it to go.   She insisted mind you.   The expression on her face says that's somehow a problem. She brings us two glasses of something I can only describe as the syrupy excrement of an apple tree. And the bill... Full price. Apparently they charged me for the time I sat there waiting for my food.    F-you. Here's your cash. Here's the generous 12% shit tip you didn't even earn.   We leave. I cool off. I get to the hotel. I lie down. Hooray I'm 30 and should have gone somewhere else for my birthday. [Pity party]  Two hours later. I wipe my tears away. After all, I'm an adult now. \"Maybe a free dessert will cheer you up.\" I take a bite. It's undercooked I think... Maybe that's intentional. I take another bite, it awfully bitter. I flip it over and the bottom is burnt. Like Cajun salmon. Black. \"Custard\" or whatever that was filed with runs out like syrup. It's a tart shell with a half inch of chocolate glaze?   Anyways... I spent the rest of my night here. On yelp. Hoping someone fires you.   Thanks for the classic 'bait and switch...'  I'm apparently missing something here. Fml."}
{"text":"Deer tartare!  \"Oh my God\" good!!  I had it the first time as an appetizer.  I changed my entree' order to the large portion immediately following my first bite.    The atmosphere here is decidedly casual.  Wood tabletops sans tablecloths.  The food is french country fare.  Yum is the only word fully applicable.  Do NOT miss the pudding chomere.  White cake baked into a bread pudding with maple syrup.  Yes it sounds simple but your taste buds will certainly sing a symphony.  Watch out ... it comes out steaming hot.  Do let it cool a little.  Eat it slowly and savor each precious bite.  It IS that good."}
{"text":"Great service and great food and although I still am not a huge fan of foie gras, I get how other people are...this is of course after having the duck in the can.  What I loved the most was the shepherds pie.  Until having tasted it here I hated it.  Now, I am sad that this restaurant is so far away from my home."}
{"text":"Insanely good. Hearty. Definitely delicious, definitely sinful. Oh my god. So worth it."}
{"text":"I. am. still. so. full.  what a meal!!  we sat by the bar- perfect seat to watch the organized chaos in action. the cooks all seem happy and enjoying themselves.  every few minutes you see them cheers a beer and take a sip. I am in awe of how they can werkk that kitchen!!! on to the food.-we started off with the amazingly refreshing bison tamaki. so good especially when you drizzle the quail egg on top. we also had the bone barrow and caviar which is amazing on that hot delicious baguette that they serve. we ended off the meal with their signature dish - named after the place. it was huge!! I mean it came out in a dish my mom uses to cook thanksgiving turkey . with that said. we over ordered. the meat was super tender and the foie gras added to it made for a delicious bite. the sauce was too heavy for my liking. would suggest ordering only one app with that dish... either way a fun vibrant place to pig out at! a must try of visiting montreal. also , I had to call numerous times to get a ressie. just keep calling- they will pick up soon."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've been to ever. Everything they served kept getting better and better. There isn't a sign out only a street number thought that was curious..."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Montreal establishments. Huge helpings of food, easily enough to feed two people with a single main course. Go easy on the ordering, it's easy to overstuff yourself, but the food's fantastic.  The staff is friendly and not at all pretentious. Our table took a while to become ready, and the staff brought over complimentary drinks for all of us to apologize, even though it wasn't really their fault. Can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"What can I say? There's a reason it's one of the best known restaurants in Montreal, and even Canada. The food was fantastic, particularly the duck carpaccio, which was perhaps the biggest surprise of the night. While we expected great things from the entrees, this little starter was exceptional.  The mains themselves were very good, but nothing that blew either of us away. Just really well-executed dishes that perfectly suited the chilly Spring evening."}
{"text":"Visiting from Melbourne Australia and great friend Julie and Derek said this restaurant is a must to finish off the trip on the last night. The purine was excellent but the duck in a can was a brilliant dish of different flavours, textures and thoroughly delightful. I have friend travelling to Montreal early 2015 and they have been told that it is not negotiable that they dine at the wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"We were in town for a party this weekend and Au Pied de Cochon was highly recommended by a friend of ours.  We arrived just in time for opening hours. And the restaurant was full within 10 minutes.  There was a buzz of activity.    The restaurant itself has a clean, rustic lodge look and feel.  Warm colors throughout.  The kitchen area is exposed and is buzzing with staff.  We walked in to the aroma of baking bread and what I believe to be hickory chips smoking in the wood burning oven.  For those of you not fluent in French, the staff speak excellent English and switched over instantly to it once they realized which language was going to be more \"comfortable\" for us. I myself can understand and read French but I am severely out of my element in conversing in it.  My kudos to the waiters and busboys for accommodating us so easily.  I will also add the staff were very friendly, attentive and professional.   There is nothing pretentious about this restaurant.  It delivers on the quality of their food.  The pricing is very reasonable given the ingredients used and the portions.  Now. On to the food.  We were told that this is the place for foie gras in Montreal.  And while I do not have it that often, this place change my mind about it.  There were six of us so we ordered five foie gras appetiziers to set the tone.  Amongst our choices.  The FG poutine, cranberry FG, balsamic reduction FG and their special FG appetizer on a buckwheat pancake, potatoes, maple syrup and a big of egg yolk.  While we gorged on the appetizers, time passed to allow our mains to be cooked.  We shared a veal shank, which was good for 3-4 people. It took about 45 mins to cook but the wait was barely noticed due to everyone dipping bread into the various foie gras sauces left over from the appetizers.  Two others shared duck in a can and one person had a French Onion soup that smelled great.  The veal rack was loaded with veggies as well so it was a balanced meal.  There was some left over due to the size.  We did manage to consume about 90% of it.  After that, we had no room for the desserts, which were tempting.    To conclude, this is a fabulous restaurant.  I really appreciate the focus on the food and the service.  The dishes here are quite unique.  Feeling adventurous? In the mood for some seared veal heart or Pig's Head for two?  This is your place.  If those dishes don't appeal to you, there is some standard far as well, such as pork chops, ducks and fish.  As much as I love the cuisine of my home city (Toronto) I am saddened that it does not have a restaurant of this calibre.  At least, none that I am aware of.  I admire Montreal's gastro scene.  This is a shining example of it."}
{"text":"This was my first foie gras experience and I loved it.  We had the foie gras in cranberry sauce as a starter and then I had the Canard Magret, which was delicious as well.  I like the bustling atmosphere in the restaurant and the people who came by our table were very attentive.  However, so many different people came to our table that we were not sure who our official server was and who we should address our questions or petitions to."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THE ALL YOU CAN EAT LOBSTER   Went there tonight with my family since my mom adores lobster, only to be told after sitting down and ordering a bottle of wine that there were no lobsters left. It was only 8:30 pm! Our waitress seemed apologetic but she didn't offer anything as a consolation to my very visibly upset mother. As it is understandable that issues arise in a restaurant, it is crazy to think that they would not offer anything to make a customer happy! After about an hour, the rest of us had ordered other very good food, our waitress brought a single lobster for my mother. Ah, finally someone sees the value in customer service! She was satisfied..... Only until the bill came with a charge for the lobster!!!! She did not order the lobster, how is it possible this waitress thought it was ok to charge us?!?! I don't think I have ever had such a terrible example of customer service at a restaurant in Montreal. I don't care how famous Martin Picard is or how good the food really is.... I would never go back and I urge all Yelp readers to not go to a place that sees no value in their customers."}
{"text":"DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EAT A SINGLE DISH ALONE.  SHARE EVERYTHING.  My favourite dish was the foie gras terrine: it beautifully showcased the lush savouriness for which foie is known, while balancing the fatty richness with a delightfully sweet apple jam peppered with toothsome chunks throughout.   Everything else was just felt like an exercise in excess.  We should have taken a hint from the table of four hulking men next to us who opted to share the stuffed pig's foot stuffed with foie.  But instead, the waiter shamelessly let both myself, and a dining companion half my size, order one each for ourselves.  The fattiness and crisp skin together delivered a marvelously succulent bite, but once I downed a second forkful, I could already feel my arteries start to wince in pain.  The duck in a can was pleasantly tender and succulent, but with all the elements blended together in this way, it almost felt like the flavours were bordering on monochromatic (although \"fatty rich goodness\" is not necessarily a flavour I would frown upon).  The confit of lamb shank, however, seemed to impress the most critical of my dining companions, who noted that the moistness was deftly preserved, and the confit embodied a full, intense flavour without being overly gamy.  And the french onion soup?  Just check out Jon H.'s review.  I think he would live and breathe and bathe in this stuff if he could."}
{"text":"I had much higher expectations for this place. Dont get me wrong- food was great... but it sort of seemed like they just serve sides with foie gras. Nothing wrong with that... but c'mon.... gets old after a while.   I would recommend this restaurant however I was left with a lot to desire.... You broke my heart Au Pied"}
{"text":"Overrated. Period. We had heard about PDC for years and finally had a chance to go during a recent trip to Montreal. The first sign of trouble came right after we arrived. We were seated in what appeared to be a row of tables reserved for tourists right across from the bathroom. We thought about asking for a table at a less busy intersection, but decided not to put up a fuss. We were so excited to see the menu, and ordered a few appetizers and a couple of the classic mains. When we asked for a wine recommendation, the waitress was distinctly unhelpful. Again, we let it slide. The first small plates to arrive were amazing: deep fried foie gras fritters, beef tartare hand rolls. So far so good. Next came the oysters. They were great, but when we asked our server where they were from, he had no idea. Okay...Then we waited *more than an hour* for the rest of our meal. Meanwhile, a couple of guys at the bar (we were told they worked here) ordered a round of drinks for the staff, and we watched as they shotgunned beers in front of us. We expected the restaurant to be casual and unpretentious--this is definitely part of the brand. But cocky frat house antics? It was a little off-putting. And yet even this we were willing to overlook as we waited patiently for our meal to arrive...and waited...and waited. By then, our initial excitement had fizzled. When the food finally did arrive, we were tired and annoyed. The famed foie gras poutine, while certainly rich, was not as extraordinary as we had hoped--and ridiculously overpriced for what it turned out to be. No doubt, PDC has churned out several dozen of these a night, every night, for many years. Instead of the timeless classic we had hoped for, however, it all seemed a bit tired. We had initially planned to order a few more courses, but at this point we decided it was time to leave. When the bill came, we swallowed our pride and paid a ridiculous amount of money for what had turned out to be an utterly disappointing experience. We came prepared to love this restaurant, and left with nothing but a bad case of heartburn."}
{"text":"Went there while vacationing in Montreal, heard so much about the place, so reserved it before leaving 3 weeks in advance. They did call back. When we arrived the restaurant was full, it's a little noisy atmosphere, but it only adds to the charm in my opinion. We ordered a pickled bison tongue for the appetizer, amazing. Main course: duck in a can, terrific, still don't understand how they make this dish and keep it warm serving at the table. The special that day they had a whole rabbit, that i shared with my daughter, very good. For desert we enjoyed chocolate pot and a pear with ice cream. Like I said, it seemed that everybody around in the restaurant enjoyed their meal and the atmosphere.  They didn't rush anybody, like somebody wrote on this site, so go and enjoy. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Visited during last week of October with boyfriend and we'd made reservations almost 10 days before. Best we got on reservations was at their opening time on a Saturday, which was ok for us. It was his second time to the restaurant.  Up front you should know, as other reviewers have written, that the noise level is very high so don't count on Au Pied de Cochon for that quiet romantic candle lit dinner, perhaps mid week is a lot different.   We were seated at window - was a little chilly in this location so perhaps you could ascertain your seating when you make the reservation.  Anyway the good was excellent. I'm probably not going to be as generous as many other reviewers because there are simply too many great restaurants in Montreal that are on the same, or even that bit higher level in my estimation in terms of taste of food, presentation, price, ambiance and well overall friendliness of staff.   It was my very first try of Foie Gras - nice but sinfully bad for you. The Duck in a Can, again was delicious, however I think the presentation was the selling point for me as I'd seen it on Anthony Bourdain show. The wine list...good but on a personal note was pricey for me.  About the floor - beware - twice I slipped coming and going to the bathroom. Not pleasant when you grab another a patron in a jam packed restaurant to hold you up. It was the same for many people. Note to management - take care of your grease problem on the floor.   Is it worth a visit - yes if you want to say you've worn the t.shirt."}
{"text":"If I could do 4.5 stars I would. This is some of the best food I've ever had. My failure to give 5 stars was for service, but I'll get to that later.  Food: We had the special terrine, which was delicious. The bread is to be expected: great fresh baguette slices. I had the house beer, unimpressive, but that's not why I was there. I was there for the \"DUCK IN A CAN.\" It was all I hoped it would be, and I am still feeling the bloat after 2 days. No need to describe it here: look it up. It's delicious, and amazing. Some reviewers think it's overpriced or gimicky. No way. It's a marvel. Girlfriend had the duck breast: perfectly cooked, and a heaping portion.  The missing star here resulted from our server. The rest of the staff (whom we interacted with about 50% of the time) was worthy of 5 stars. Our primary server, however, was an impatient d-bag. I hope they pool tips because I tipped well, but if I could have tipped this guy less than the obligatory American 20% I would have. With the money paid, and the effort put in to get a reservation in advance, just smile and pat my fuzzy head when I ask you a question, even if it's a silly question. Don't scoff and then try to run away. There was a server name printed on the receipt, but that might be the server who actually ran my credit card (he was nice) so no need to out anyone by name.  Anyway, delightful place, mind-blowing food, nice decor, good music playing, friendly waitstaff, and one server that was dick and reduced the enjoyment of a duck in a can very slightly (but not that much because it was awesome!)."}
{"text":"Disappointing. While waiting for our table, we saw a filthy tank full of eels, slithering on top of each other, some dead. They had an eel bourguignon on the menu, so I assume that's what they were for, but I didn't need to see them from my table. The floor was greasy and slippery and the bathroom is in the middle of the kitchen. We ordered the chicken liver mousse and foie grois burger and a veal pasta that was the special, but unfortunately, they were sold out of the veal pasta. The chicken liver mousse was mediocre at best. Our waiter asked us if we'd like to move on to the next course and we said yes, but we were left waiting for a long while after that. I asked about the status of our order and was told that the foie grois burger patties were \"being made.\" I asked to cancel the order since we'd already been there for 1.5 hours, and our waiter told me he'd go check on the food. He magically came back one minute later with two lukewarm burgers. The burgers were fine. Fatty and unremarkable. While we were eating, the staff took out the trash from the front entrance, passing by our table while we were eating. Disgusting. There was a fly on the table next to us. The staff was unapologetic about any of these issues. Would not recommend, especially since there are many other quality food establishments to choose from in Montreal. Don't let the big-name chef fool you, it's all a big scam."}
{"text":"Dont forget the gravol after you have that. We were 5 to have it and 2 of us vomited, and it was just sitting on the stomach of the others all day. Very very overrated and expensive for nothing"}
{"text":"First time visiting Montreal and with rave reviews from yelp, I knew I had to book a reservation here.  We were not disappointed!  The only reservation available was 10:30pm on Thu and we gladly accepted.    Pinot Noir - good  Poutine - never had before and although the cheese curds were unusual for a topping, they proved to be delicious with the gravy Duck in a Can - excellent presentation, rich and savory over sauteed veggies, toast? and mashed potatoes Stuffed Pig's foot w/foie gras - signature dish - when my husband ordered this, the waiter warned him it was a big dish.  There was no exaggeration there.  Everyone surrounding us stared as it was brought to the table.  When placed in front of him, the crowd cheered ooh aaahh.  Patrons waiting in line for a table looked in amazement and asked \"What is that?!\"  De-li-cious!  Definitely make a reservation here.  We are certainly glad we did.  And would return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Le plus impressionnant de la soirÃ©e demeure le serveur. Je ne me souviens malheureusement pas de son nom mais un type super sympa qui connait son menu Ã  la perfection. J'Ã©tais rassasier juste Ã  l'Ã©couter en faire la description! Bravo! La bouffe 'chic comfort food' Ã©tait Ã  la hauteur des attentes."}
{"text":"This review is based predominately on the service, not on the quality of the food, which was generally very good.   We had an 8 pm reservation and arrived at five minutes past 8. We checked in with the hostess who told us to wait outside for a little. We waited for about 25 minutes until the hostess told us that unfortunately nobody was leaving but that we could ether eat at the bar or continue to wait for a table. We asked her estimate of how long a table would take and she guessed that it would be another 20 minutes. So we decided to wait for a table.  Five minutes later she returned and told us that it was actually unlikely that a table would be free within 15 minutes and that we could start at the bar and move to a table once one freed up. We acquiesced and sat at the bar.  After about 20 minutes, we noticed the first table open up. The hostess said nothing. Ten minutes later another free table. Nothing. More open tables; more silence. In short: reservation for 8 pm; seated at the bar at 8:45: ordered at 9:05; served at 10:10.  We were happy to stay at the bar but there was never any offer to sit at a table or an acknowledgement that they could not accommodate us.  After making a reservation more than a month in advance - to ensure that we had a stress free and enjoyable experience - we were sitting next to a couple of random dudes who had just happened upon the restaurant at the last minute and were lucky enough to get seated. Based on the PDC's reputation, we had high expectations. Overall, they weren't met. My advice, go to Le'Express. Two days beofre, we had an amazing experience. The minute we arrived, they honored our reservation and seated us. Top notch service. Great food. Basically same cost as PDC but much less pretentious."}
{"text":"Imagine Montreal: green areas and fountain ponds; young and vibrant people floating through, accepting; the most colorful homes; sun glinting off the oblique, magic tilt of an iron staircase winding up the front of your neighbors place. This is, truly, a city made for humanity. Au Pied du Cochon fits right into the city of my dreams. A raucous, friendly bar provides direct viewing access to the chefs in the kitchen, working their pork into mouth treasure. I've never had a pork tenderloin quite like the heaping, tender, white piece I had here on vacation with the woman I love. An excellent beer selection served in big ol' boots didn't hurt either. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"(Pause)... I'm trying not to swallow my own vomit. I mean... the Duck n' a can I ordered (watch the Youtube video, if u haven`t had the pleasure in person). Let me get this clear: the service, the resto, the novelty, everything is A-one! I seriously love the concept and it deserves all the hype it receives, 5 stars for creativity! But the main favourites like the poutine, Dn'C etc... my god... zero regard for flavour balance. So go ahead, bring it on APdC lovers, but if you have half a tasting palette in your mouth, you will O.D. on salt and creamy, fatty richness. Many people love it. So the novelty is cute and foie-gras vampires who are legally deprived of foie gras in NYC will flock to APdC (as would I), but I don't buy into this as a MontrÃ©alais. The desserts (not that they are important after eating a Pig Head) pulled down my rating, as well. Unfortunately for me, I was wearing my reality goggles through my courses and although I had an amazing time- cet endroit est une vraie inside-joke culinaire. And I could only laugh at the irony. Would I go back? No, I rather go to Juste pour rire. I rate it 2 stars, on the premise that this was my first and last time coming here. If this food came-off of a foodtruck for 18$ or less per plate... ahh... then 4 stars. Otherwise I believe this funky concept is misplaced as a restaurant. This kind of sinful, sloppy food belongs in styrofoam packaging, not fine glass plates... if you get my drift."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  Atmosphere feels like a casual restaurant but they serve first class food.  We started off with the PDC seafood platter.  This has to be the best seafood platter ever.  It had a great variety of stuff - clams, mussles, razor clams, snails, conch, sea urchin, crab.  All of which tasted delicious.  The way they serve the seafood is usually with some sauce and let me tell you that the sauce or mixings they serve it with was wonderful.  The razor clam was chopped up and mixed into a salad.  Sea urchin was served in its own shell but with some sort of creme fraiche.  Conch was served with this mayo mixture.  Everything was awesome!  For other starters, we also had the bison tongue and the foie gras with bacon and maple syrup.  The bison tongue was very hearty and the tongue very tender.  The foie gras was so delicious.  It was served with bacon and potatoes in a maple syrup reduction.  The waiter had me at bacon... I never thought the maple syrup would go well but it did.  The sweetness was perfect for foie gras.  For entrees, we had the \"Duck in a can\" and the foie gras with pig's feet.  Both of which were amazing.  The Duck in a can is really a sight to see.  The waiter comes by with a plate that has potatoes and some cabbage.  And a hot can on the side.  He opens the can and then dumps the contents, which is duck and foie gras, onto the plate.  The presentation itself is enough to make heads turn.     The foie gras with pig's feet was really good too.  It was in a very hearty mushroom sauce.  It tasted like home.  The meat was falling off the bone.  Both entrees were delicious.  They were both very hearty.  Don't over order when you come here or else it would feel heavy.    We were too full for dessert :)  I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I love it.  I just love it.  It is a cute unpretentious restaurant that just feels exceptional.  The service is wonderful, friendly, and very attentive.  One waiter even made recommendations for a nearby patron who was a vegetarian.  A side note -- this is NOT the place for vegetarians, and the name of the restaurant is Pig's Feet, and the food is french, so if you have any moral or personal objections to fois gras, eating meat, or if you are on a diet -- do NOT come here.  The fries are cooked in duck fat -- nuff said.  However, if you love meat, rich and decadent food, this is the place to be.  Had the goat cheese and beet salad, which was very flavorful but not overpowering, the steak frites, which was tender and served with grilled mushrooms and onions.  Truly enjoyed both desserts -- the chocolate mousse (pot de creme chocolate noir) and the pouding chomeur, which is served hot and is exceptionally sweet.  They have a great selection of teas as well.  Our bill for two came out to $100.  I highly recommend this place.  They are open until midnight, which is also wonderful."}
{"text":"Finally got to eat here after foolishly trying to get reservations a week before my visit a few years back. Making a reservation was very easy... three weeks notice worked for me this time.   Very, very good, but not the flawless (or near flawless) experience I was hoping for.   There seemed to be some communication issues between front of house and the kitchen... they were out of a lot of desserts, but we only found out after we ordered and the server took the order. There were too many specials, at least a dozen, I love specials, but I draw the line somewhere around 5. I felt sorry for my poor server!   House brew is great and a decent price.   The pates and meat platters are to die for. The maki special was excellent too, if a little strange for a French place.   Love, love, love the atmosphere and the staff is wonderful, if a little scatterbrained and overwhelmingly busy."}
{"text":"Martin Picard is a charlatan. Just because you can add foie gras to every dish, doesn't mean you have to. Serving great materials in a can like the \"duck in a can\" is a bad joke. It looks awful and the idea of cooking sourkrat with foie gras is just sad for the  poor goose that had to give its liver for this disgrace. I'm not impressed by a waiter that tells me about the blue fin tuna they got today and then serves it with spicy mayonnaise. I can't understand a place that serves a wine glass from an open bottle that is too cold and rotten (the waiter said it's disgusting!). How can an open bottle be rotten?! It means that either they served it to other people or that it's been lying in the fridge for a few days open. Both options are bad. There were two dishes that i liked and in both the theme was \"keep it simple\" (bison tangue and braised beef with mashed potatoes). If you have good taste, don't come near this overly trying to be cool and laid back restaurant. Just go eat poutine on saint dennis. It will be almost the same and cheapest."}
{"text":"Very impressive.  We sat at the bar overlooking the cooks prepare every dish.  It was a great experience being in the thick of it and seeing them work so cohesively - when it came to our food we appreciated it even more!  The foie gras poutine was excellent.  My only complaint would have been to have had more chips, but I guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing!   We had considered getting a pork dish (given the restaurant name involves a pig) but decided to go for Duck in a can.  Its unique and delicious.  Would recommend going here if you are in Montreal, but make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Delish! Hard to get a reservation..be sure to call way in advance (1+ months)."}
{"text":"Simply incredible.  All around amazing.  The food was magnificent and the service truly top notch.  I was amazed at how the restaurant balanced being artful and gourmet with being genuinely welcoming and fun to its patrons.  Among other things we shared one of their specials for the night, pork shoulder with fiddleheads and gnocchi.  The texture and flavor were superb.  I could write about everything we ate with similar gushing adjectives, but I'll spare you.  Overall, one of the best dining experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"I went here twice, and both times had an excellent dining experience! The last visit was during Thanksgiving holidays, and we had 10:30 pm reservation. It is a bit late for dinner, but this was the only available time. We arrived 15 minutes earlier, for we knew how busy this place is. Despite being early, we still had to wait for extra 30 minutes, and finally got our table at about 10:45 pm. Now, at any other place I would be upset about the delay, but this one is an exception. The place is bustling, and we were fortunate to get a reservation just couple days in advance. Plus, I can imagine how hard it is for the lone hostess to mange this huge and unabated crowd. Once we got a table, the service was prompt yet not annoying (unlike many places in Boston, for example, where you might feel pressured to ask for the check and leave in the end of the meal). The food was absolutely delicious, with generous portions. I had Happy Pork Chop, and my wife ordered a duck dish (don't quite remember the name, but not Duck in a Can). Both dishes were perfectly executed.  Since portions are large, and quite heavy in terms of fat and caloric content, we ordered light desert - Poached Pear, which comes with wonderful vanilla ice-cream.  Additionally, the restaurant now has its own beer - Pied de Cochon, a light brew that goes well with large amounts of fat pork and duck meat.  Another important aspect is the price - dinner for two with tips will cost you less than $150, which I consider to be an excellent price given the quality of food.  In summary, excellent restaurant with casual, laid-back atmosphere that allows you to enjoy delicious food without breaking the bank."}

{"text":"Not for people who likes to eat light. I felt like a brick was in my stomach after eating here. Food was flavorful and service was good. Fois gras is on everything."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, the menu is one of a kind and the service and environment of the restaurant is really great.   However, I do find most of their food way too heavy as almost everything is drenched in foie gras and grease/fat. Their specialty, the stuffed pied du cochon, was almost impossible to finish, as it was just too greasy and there was hardly any meat on it. Even if you pack the leftovers the next day and reheat it, the texture/taste of the meat changes and tastes pretty bad.   Therefore, the restaurant a bit overrated in my opinion and I would only recommend going for those who can handle extremely heavy meals."}
{"text":"A wonderfully knowledgable server. An excellent bottle of wine. Smashing appetizers:  Bison tongue with pickles, carrot, and aioli, and a zucchini loaded with veal, pasta, basil and cheese. 45 minutes in, I thought this would be in the top three meals of my life.  But then, our mains came out. Although the Duck-in-a-Can and roasted stuffed pork (with mushrooms, greens and more mushrooms) were delicious, we could have made do with about 1/16th the portion of each. Both dishes were a tremendous assault of rich flavors and fatty decadence.  We really enjoyed our dinner at Au Pied de Cochon, and I think we'd absolutely go back... but I think the trick might be to eat our way through the small plates instead of trying to tackle the heavy hitters."}
{"text":"This is a must try, believe the hype for the most part.   been a few times.  Some of the appetizers are skippable, and the fois poutine is overrated in my opinion.  The value here is actually amazing. The cost is not prohibitive at all for most dishes.   GO for the stuffed pig leg with fois gras.  Seriously. Also the blood pudding is amazing."}
{"text":"Dined here last night. Very busy tight happening place. If you are on a diet, leave it  at home. This is foie grass heaven.   Dishes were very rich and the service was great. Try the poutine, best I had. Appetizers are good portion, perfect for sharing. Expect a wait to get in but it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Le restaurant ou vous voulez amener vos amis Ã©trangers de passage Ã  MontrÃ©al. Une expÃ©rience dont ils vont vous reparler dans 10 ans.

En saison, le homard et les fruits de mers sont excellents. Mon favoris : la plogue Ã  Champlain. Ne pas abuser cependant ... trÃ¨s dangereux pour le foie ..."}
{"text":"A-ok. Portions a little small, the gravy was cold (cheese did not melt either) and the beignet Cochon too greasy. Bonus points for the concept however. Good flavours though, might have been an \"off\" day."}
{"text":"Considering we could only get reviews at 11pm on Sunday evening.. Our evening was already going to be ..different.  I work for Food Network and I could not pass up a chance to eat here. Plus, Derek Bocking of Top Chef Canada fame was sitting nearby. Martin, not there at the time.. alas.  The first thing to note is that they hoarded the English speakers to the front. This is understandable, so the waitress could speak to us all, but she chose to do so.. in an interesting way. She would address us, along with the two tables on either side simultaneously. Interesting approach. The washroom is unmarked, I needed help to find, and the floor was SLICK with grease. A friend we made in line wiped out the second he walked in. Oh, also the air reaks of rendering pig fat.. but if you can make it past all of this.. there is the food.   the SO and I, having waited to 11pm to eat dinner, were famished and over ordered. The smoked sausage starter was really outstanding. I am German and well versed on smoked sausage. It was sour, and perfect.   I enjoyed the French onion soup which was mostly bubbling cheese (yum) and a delicious rosemary infused broth. There were chunks fo pork in it which I found detracted from the soup. Still, really good.   Special tuna \"handroll\" with chopped tuna, nori, rice, fish eggs and quail egg. Ridiculous. Best handroll I have ever had.   My main was a special, a tuna with eggplant and tomato. It was really good, albiet slightly overcooked. The SO had a pot of various pig bits on mashed potato. he liked it other than the blood sausage which he found only ok (although just recently back from a Blood fueled fiesta in Germany) We were too full to finish and unable to at 1am. The two mains were amazing fresh form the hotel room fridge the next morning.  Wine was good, beer selection ok. We had a good meal. Kinda pricey, keep that in mind. And reservations... book early."}
{"text":"Dear Myles P, It is obvious that you have no clue how restaurants operate. While I understand being pissed that you were left standing in the rain, that would irk me as well. What I cant stand is customers like you who assume just because you see empty tables that you are entitled to one. Let me explain how a reservation system works... Most busy restaurants seat an earling seating and a late seating. For my restaurant we take reservations from 6:00 to 7:00 and then again from 8:30 to 9:15. The restaurant then does its best to spread those early reservations evenly across those early seating times... 6:00, 6:15, 6:30, 6:45 and 7:00. Now, you might decide to arrive at 5:45 (our hours are clearly stated and we are rushing to finish last minute details before we open, but that is ok please let yourself right in) You might think 'Hey I deserve a table I'm the first one here!' well on a busy night every fucking seat I have is reserved for someone elses ass...not yours. And if you bitch and moan it is just going to make me hate you more...because I am protecting my customers who secured their reservation sometimes weeks in advance and I'm not going to fuck up their reservations because you are a dumbass and think you can walk right in and have whatever table you want on a friday night.   What will get you a table... \"Hi I am so sorry I'm early, I realize you guys are still setting up and I apologize for getting in the way. We don't have a reservation but is there any way if we hang out at the bar for a while and you have anything open up maybe we could be sat for dinner?\"  If you act like that I will do my absolute best to give you the fist table that opens up from a cancellation or a no show. And If I do get you a table a thank you and maybe even a small tip would be a very nice show of gratitude for going out of my way to try and accommodating you."}
{"text":"Un avis plutÃ´t court parce que rendu Ã  eux, j'avais dÃ©jÃ  soupÃ©. Je n'ai donc essayÃ© que leur beigne aux fraises du QuÃ©bec! Oh my! Un dÃ©lice!   P.S. Le floater de soda Ã  l'Ã©rable avec crÃ¨me glacÃ©e Ã  l'Ã©rable doit Ãªtre dÃ©bile! Je vous en redonne des nouvelles Ã  ma prochaine visite!"}
{"text":"Dimanche dernier, j'ai essayÃ© leurs brunchs (qui seront disponibles seulement jusqu'Ã  la fin de l'hiver). Je me suis rÃ©galÃ©, j'ai trop mangÃ© et tout Ã§a pour moins de 20$.   Ã 4, nous avons essayÃ© prÃ¨s de 20 petits plats diffÃ©rents. Les plats sont prÃ©sentÃ©s sur des chariots qui passent entre les tables, qui donnent faim et qui sentent bon! Il est impossible de s'arrÃªter!   Je vous recommande particuliÃ¨rement la brioche Ã  l'Ã©rable servie Ã  la cuillÃ¨re tellement elle fond de sirop d'Ã©rable, le muffin anglais surmontÃ© de porc hachÃ©, de saumon, d'un oeuf pochÃ© et d'une sauce hollandaise et les schnitzels. S'il y en a, sauter sur les profiteroles qui sont absolument divins.   Le jambon de leur ferme tranchÃ© Ã  la table est Ã©galement un incontournable pour les nostalgiques du vrai jambon juteux et savoureux comme on n'en trouve plus Ã  l'Ã©picerie.  Les plats varient entre 2 et 8$. C'est pourquoi, on prend ceci et celÃ  et ceci et celÃ  et on reÃ§oit la facture avec peur et on est tout de suite soulagÃ© pour ne pas dire surpris du si petit prix. Pour exactement 18 plats (dont certains avec du foie gras), Ã§a ne nous a coÃ»tÃ© que 18$ par personne en plus du pourboires. Plus que raisonnable!   * Ãa vaut la peine d'arriver un peu en avance pour profiter du divan installÃ© sur le trottoir devant le restaurant ainsi que de leur food truck installÃ© dans la rue qui vend des chocolats chauds et des beignes pour nous faire patienter.   Je vous recommande le chocolat chaud fait sur le poÃªle comme le faisait ma grand-mÃ¨re. Juste assez riche, juste assez sucrÃ© et parfaitement chocolatÃ©."}
{"text":"In Au Pied De Cochon, I had the best Foie Gras dish that I have ever had. But the food was good, but too heavy to my taste. If you love Foie Gras, meat and are not afraid of animal fat, you'll love this place.   My wife and I went to Au Pied De Cochon during our recent trip to Montreal. The food was good, the price was reasonable, the portions were very generous and the service was great.  I never liked Foie Gras. But I loved Foie Gras Cromesquis that I had here. It's absolutely the best Foie Gras that I have ever had. I also liked Piglet Roast, the tender piglet meat and their sauce complimented each other wonderfully. Their Bison tongue was also very very good.  For entrees, we ordered Duck in a Can and Catch of the Day(halibut). The duck dish had a rich combination of Foie Gras, duck meat(with skin), vegetable and their tasty sauce. Everything was put in a sealed can and cooked in the oven. The duck meat was cooked rare, which was perfect. But for me, the skin was undercooked, it didn't taste good with all the half-cooked fat on it. I wish they had seared the skin and cooked down the fat before putting it into the can. The halibut was good, the meat was tender and the tasted great with the sauce.   We had a good time at Au Pied De Cochon. I would have gave it 5 stars had the food been a bit lighter and more balanced."}
{"text":"Ever been to an expensive restaurant and not feel ripped off? Well I havent until I ate the foie gras poutine at au pied de cochon. Imagine a flavor packed gravy train colliding in your mouth and you have a small grasp of what its like to bite into the foie gras. I cant complain about anything, even the bathroom was cool. If you go to Montreal and dont make it to this restaurant, shame on you!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure if I could be gluttonous enough to fully enjoy everything I wanted to try.  I was, and it was good.  Now, 2 days later, the lingering effects are still there, reminders of a great night but cautioning against a repeat performance.  Started with some great pickled tongue.  Really, really phenomenal.  My wife had foie gras and loved it not only for the taste, but the presentation.  Next up was the beet/goat cheese salad.  Very rich and a large  portion.  Stacked neopolitan style.    I had waited to try the duck in a can for some time.  After ordering, I started to regret it after seeing it served to someone else.  But I decided to eat it all and the rest is history.  Moist duck with foie gras.  I really can't remember being that full.  Obviously, dessert was skipped.  The size of the pork chop my wife was given was 2\" thick and the size of my outstretched hand.  She was smart enough to get the leftover packaged up to take back to the hotel.  What made me go with 5/5 rather than 4/5 was the fact that Martin Picard thanked me and let me take a picture with him.  He seemed genuine and took the time to talk to folks.  You don't see that alot."}
{"text":"This place totally makes me think of the Black Hoof in Toronto, following the trend of in your face meat eating, where patrons eagerly munch on bone marrow as appetizers before settling on pig's head (yes literally pigs head) for the main course.  You have to be really hungry to eat here, and on a low fat diet to prepare yourself for the cholesterol shock that is about to hit your digestive system.  I wanted to try something light, which is probably why the night didn't fare so well.  I followed ht the waiter's recommendation for an original \"salad\": pan seared veal over potatoes and watercress.  The dish was immersed in olive oil to the point of being soupy, and topped with an egg.  There was very little in the way of greens, so I don't know how this was categorized as a salad.  Unsurprisingly, this was very, very heavy.     I give full points for creativity, since I've never quite had anything like it before, but can't say I enjoyed it and could only eat half before I felt overwhelmed by the grease.   The creme brulee and molten lava cakes were fine as desserts--but they are always a safe bet.   If you're looking for a meaty place, this is for you.  If you were hoping for a light meal go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Historically French influenced cooking turned white-trash Quebecios, then returned to high-end fine dining with a relaxed casual feel. -So clever is the concept of this place: average tab 100 bucks a person to sit at thick wooden tables (or the bar in our case) under glass encased lamps and moose antlers in a modern take on a hunting lodge in the frozen north.   The chef de cuisine looks about 20, speaks and works a million miles an hour...highly skilled...downing espresso shots with co-worker while describing what he wants us to try.  Buffalo tartar comes rough chopped, in a metal bowl  similar to the one I use to feed our German Shepard, carefully broken eggshell holding a yolk to mix in. The best I have eaten. Oxtail w/ Paparedelle, Blood Sausage Tart. My GOD!  Pot de Creme the richest I have ever eaten, served in mason jars, topped with graham crackers and sour cream.  Just like granny Deneuve used to make in her trailer outside Quebec City.....only better."}
{"text":"I give it a 3 stars because for four reasons: 1) This is Not a restaurant. It is a Bar which offer a delicacy items (foie gras, pig head, etc.). 2) the place is ridiculously  expensive given the fact it is a bar! 3) The place is extremely noisy, come one it is a bar, of course it is noisy. 4) the service is very very slow.   We went to this bar to eat foie gras. We were a party of 5. After we been seated, and the bus boy poured us the tap water. Were were left for almost 15 minutes. Then the waiter came and asked if we would like to order a Starter. He suggested the daily special of salads. Given their prices we expected quality and quantity. Come one, a small dish of tomato with sauce for $12? We ordered Foie Gras Cromesquis for $3.5. No one on the table including who swallowed the two pieces know how it tastes. We ordered Cured Foie Gras & Boudin Tart, Duck in a Can, Bison Rib, and PDC's Melting Pot. This is a one greasy choice of dishes. None of us manage to finish her/his plate. So if you have a family history of heart attacks, obesity, low blood pressure, high blood pressure, avoid this restaurant.  We noticed that most clientele were hip-hop-styled. If you are looking for good quality, tasteful food, and you are willing to foot $50/person + drink per person, go to a restaurant."}
{"text":"Believe the hype -- this restaurant delivers.  Had dinner here on a Sunday night at 8 and it was jammed.  The tomato tart and roast piglet apps are excellent. Duck cooked in a can is one of APC's signature dishes - magret duck, foie gras, bacon and cabbage. Opened tableside and poured on a crouton.  It is, without a doubt, the richest dish I have ever eaten.  I made it through about half before I surrendered. My wife loved the butter poached salmon."}
{"text":"No wonder this place is the highest rated restaurant in Montreal on yelp and also world renowned.  It's on a small one way road off of rue st. Dennis with a bunch of small restaurants on it.    We were sat immediately by the hostess.  The waiter was very nice and took time with us about recommendations and the specials and was always coming by making sure everything was good and our wine glasses stayed full.  First off we got bread and butter which was baked that day which was very tasty.  We decided to share a few appetizers.  We started with the foie gras cromisque  and duck carpaccio.  The duck had an egg yolk that blended perfect with the taste of duck, herbs and spices. Next we got the show stopper.... The foie gras poutine which was nothing short of spectacular.  All of the flavors combined perfectly.  If I could eat one thing for the rest of my life it would be that.  We also had foie gras tout nu which was also delicious.    My girlfriend and I thought we were still hungry so we got the gnocchi.  They prepared it table side mixing everything in a large cut out cheese wheel peeling off cheese while they mixed if was great.  We could not even finish this..... We were so stuffed.  Our clothes felt like they got a few sizes tighter and our waist lines a bit bigger we had to get dessert to go.  But a few hours later a pecan pie in bed was a perfect way to finish the night!  Overall of the best meals I've had in my life.   A MUST GO TO in Montreal.  Will 100% be back."}
{"text":"walked in around 5 o clock and got a table with no wait and no reservations! can't believe it happened but it did :)  had the duck in a can, never had duck before ... was sick for a week with the runs...could not eat anything without having to go to the bathroom right after i put food in my mouth. guess i am not the most adventurous/fatty food eater but did not realize how sick this food could make me. people who are not used to this kind of food...beware!"}
{"text":"I have never ever been so intimidated to go to a restaurant before.  I did my research and watched the No Reservations Episode, read reviews and reviewed the menu.  I literally felt full just getting information on this place.  The food lives up to the billing.  BIG portions, indulgent is an understatement, and yes flavors that make you want one more bite even if your stomach will not comply.  I never ever thought I would say this but you can have too much Foie Gras.  I wish they did a tasting menu rather that making you try to select from a few dishes.  The waiter told us we ordered way too much.  WE DID!!!  But we wanted to try things.  After surrendering and eating only half of the duck for 2; we did manage to suck it up and have a great goat cheese and raspberry tart.  The rest of the night was spent in pain laying around but it was worth every indulgent bite."}
{"text":"Great, inventive food, as has been noted here previously.  I'll only add that what I really appreciated about this place is its lack of pretense. It really is all about the food here. Great operation. Had a wonderful time here."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food! Reservation at 9 for two... seated promptly and pleasantly! Small place but the lively atmosphere was enjoyable. I had the pork chop and my companion had the duck in a can... generous portions and the food was outstanding! The service was top notch! Highly recommend when you in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The Service:  Showed up 15 minutes before our reservation of 4 and was seated 45 minutes after our 9:30P reservation that was made 2 months in advance.  We stood outside as group after group was seated before us and was eventually told they all arrived before us; a quick glance at their reservation sheet showed us that reservations after us were already seated.  We were offered a beer for our troubles but was relegated to standing in their corridor since we were not allowed to drink outside.    After finally getting seated, they took our orders but forgot about my beer, which the waitress quickly denied that I ordered it with her.   She did apologize after looking at our order again.  One of the appetizers was brought out with a piece of the codfish fritters falling on the table.  The person delivering the food just simply said, \"Oh, sorry.\" and left.  Our fork and knives were taken away after eating our foie gras poutine (will get to that later) and then bread was delivered with only a huge spoon to spread the butter?  The Food:  The food was okay.  It was a little too fatty and greasy despite knowing what the menu was full of.  The foie gras poutine was delicious.  Nice portions of foie gras coupled with a thick, hearty, flavorful gravy.  I ordered the foie gras hamburger.  The foie gras was larger than the patty!  You can interpret that as you like.  Tried a piece of the pied de cochon stuffed with foie gras and it just tasted greasy with no substantial meat at all.  The duck in a can was okay, but tasted like steamed duck.  I would not waste my time or money here.  A pretty horrible experience for a restaurant that's supposed to be \"hottest\" restaurant in Montreal.  The only saving grace was the poutine."}
{"text":"Very good food here. But beware, portions are large and it's easy to over order.   With a group of 7, we pre-ordered the TÃªte de cochon and ordered Poutine au foie gras, Foie gras aux pommes (but with cranberry instead because it was the special of the day), Pied de cochon and a Bison Tartare. This was definitely too much food.  The Poutine au foie gras was delicious. They don't cheap out on the fois gras, gravy, cheese or the fries. You'll get half melted cheese and some of them still in the form of chunks. The fois gras melts in perfectly. For me, this appetizer is on the heavy side.  The Foie gras aux cranberry was a nice, light appetizer. The fruit is refreshing and the fois gras adds an extra pinch of \"classiness\" to the dish.  The Bison Tartare was nice and tender, although more on the spicy side (there was a lot of pepper). It comes with a side salad, which was a good getaway from all the meat.   The Pied de cochon was a humongous dish. The main dish hides under a hefty layer of broiled onions along with a gigantic side of mashed potatoes. The feet itself was good, the entire dish is a little heavy for my liking.  Finally, the TÃªte de cochon was the star of the night. The head is searched with a lobster crawling out of its mouth. The dish sparks curiosity - you get to taste how every part of this pig's head tastes (which to me, tastes practically the same). As for texture, I prefer the inner cheeks and the pig ears. However, once you get to the inner cheeks, you might get a slice of pig brains too. The outer cheeks were way too fat for me. It gives you the type of gross feeling you'd get after eating a junk food meal. The snout and chin was tougher than the rest. We even ate the eye!  The overall pig's head was very flavorful. The lobster is a light side to munch on when you get tired of the pig. I wish the other veggies on the side weren't as oily though.  If you decide to go to Au Pied de Cochon, prepare for a feast. You will find yourself eating twice or three times more than you usually do. The food is great, and you will need a nice long nap after the meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Service was incredible. The food was the definition of French comfort food. This is a must restaurant in MontrÃ©al. If I'm in MontrÃ©al I'll be returning here to eat."}
{"text":"Trop chers pour la qualitÃ©. Service moyen. La prÃ©tendu originalitÃ© du chef se limite Ã  de la \"Junk food\" de luxe."}
{"text":"Au pied du Cochon is the quintessential Montreal restaurant.  Go with a large group and order everything.  Only upset that this does not exist in NYC."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Montreal for Labor Day weekend.  We had actually decided on another spot for our \"big fancy\" dinner out but as it turns out, that restaurant was closed on Sunday nights.  As this place was also highly recommended to us, we trekked there.  Of course, halfway through the fifteen minute walk it starts torrentially pouring.  So when we arrived we're pretty sopping wet and just ready to have a drink (but still in good enough spirits).  The look on the hostess's face when we said we didn't have reservation was priceless: this was certainly not a place to just pop into.  She did take pity on us though, and when a reservation at the bar was late she let us take the spot.  The bartenders that waited on us were incredibly nice and helpful in our selections ---even going so far to suggest we cut down our orders since our appetizers and such were larger and heavier than we were expecting.  My boyfriend and I split the ever-famous duck in a can and it was just as amazing as the hype would lead you to believe.  Definitely easy to split between two people, and we still didn't finish it after splitting an appetizer and separate first courses.  (I'm a big fan of beef tartare and they have an amazing rendition of it)   It is pricey but worth every dime.  Great neighborhood as well for walking around and shopping."}
{"text":"Visited here on the recommendation of a friend who used to live in MontrÃ©al. This was my first experience of Poutine. I had the Foie Gras Poutine and I was not disappointed! It was amazing. Any poutine I ever have again will always be compared to this dish.   Also had the seared tuna belly on the recommendation of the server. It was an excellent choice.    Service is a little slow just because the place is so rocking busy! The sign of a good restaurant so it's hard to complain.   I was in town on business and so travelling solo - arrived at 6pm on a Tuesday and I was lucky to get a seat at the bar without a reservation. But they did ask how long I would be staying because there was someone else with a reservation for 8pm. I wouldn't have thought this would be an issue because it was 2 hrs before but with the slow service I was out until 745pm.   I'd definitely go again but it would be more fun with a group. And reservations - there's no way to get a table without it."}
{"text":"The hype is real. Amazing experience.  We ordered the PIED DE COCHON farcie au fois gras.  The lady recommended to share it with 2 people, so we took an appetizer too.  woowwo the Comesquis foie gras. CRAZY! You put it in your mouth and it EXPLODED of juiciness. So tasty. I would've have eaten 10 of those, no problem haha The Pied de Cochon is impressive. Crispsy on the outside, wall of fat and meat/ veggies and stuff inside. Foie gras a bit everywhere and potatoes on the bottom. Sauce matches well with the meal. I'd say the first 10 mins of eating is amazing. Then you feel like dying from heart attack ahha. Really fatty dishes, but if you take a drink it goes well.  Once in a lifetime experience.  Definitely coming back for the big head with lobster. Keep the good job! We like those kind of restaurants in Montreal"}
{"text":"Last day on earth...what would I have? Any and everything from this amazing place. We had a wide selection of delectable delights here and every single one of them were amazing. The foie gras pizza is something to write home about and the actual pigs foot is something to think about. If I'm ever lucky enough to venture back to this beautiful city, this place better watch out because I'm coming hungry and I'm coming ready!"}
{"text":"Waited about two years to get a reservation to this place. First time around I didn't stay up til midnight to fill out the Google form.  Lesson learned! The food did not disappoint. Everything was maple syrup-themed in March. Four appetizer, 3 mains, and 4 desserts. All delicious and worth the drive up from MA. Dont worry if you don't speak French, there are plenty of people who speak English. We brought our 2 year old. He was free. He picked off what we had and there was still plenty to go around. I will definitely do this again!"}
{"text":"This meal was phenomenal, sent here for a bachelor party and wasn't disappointment.  Our waiter recommended dishes and was a great help.  I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.  The food was to die for, the service was friendly, and the aromas are mouth-watering!  Most definitively in my top 10 restauratns of all time.  I highly recommend the steak frites, steak tartar, and duck carpacho.   Price was very reasonable for the food."}
{"text":"I'm torn between three (Blasphemous, I know) and four stars. I reserved 2 weeks in advance, and the only available reservation for two was around 10 pm, which was fine - it gave us time to build our appetites for the much anticipated meal. :) We were quickly seated, and ordered our wine. We had the tarte aux tomates as an entree, which was absolutely delicious. The pastry was crispy and buttery, the cheese was nicely broiled and tomato flavour really pops.  I had the duck magret with mushrooms.  The first bite was a burst of flavour. The broth/sauce was concentrated and rich. After a few bites though, it quickly became way too much fat and salt. I just couldn't eat any more (hence the three stars). My boyfriend had the foie gras poutine and loved every second of it.  I'm a grease wimp, and don't care for foie gras. Service was pleasant (the bus boy was very sorry to have dropped a dirty knife on my boyfriend.. oops! it happens).  The atmosphere is vibrant and lively. All in all, the food is good, just too rich and fatty for my taste."}
{"text":"It was my friend Justin's birthday, 2012.  My friend Yi and I ordered the pig's head. But you see, it wasn't just a pig's head. A lobster in the mouth, and with the skull pried open to reveal the brain, this was a feast for the ages.  Did I mention it was 2012? Ok, because that evening ex-Premier of Quebec Jean Charest walked in with his family and favorite bodyguards and sat on the table to our right. It was the height of the student protests and I guess the twittersphere must have been active that night. Within 20 minutes the restaurant was surrounded with angst-filled unfulfilled twenty-somethings banging on the walls and windows of the cozy restaurant. That said, my friends and I were far too involved with the pig's head to care.   Get the pig's head."}
{"text":"First of all, don't over-order! Portions are HUGE for most things. We ordered 2 mains, each of which could've fed 5 people (maybe close to 10 for a pork shoulder special that came in a HUGE casserole dish.) Tongue appetizer was fantastic, as with everything pork. Menu here focused on 3 things: 1) Pig, 2) Seafood, 3) Foie. Don't like the last, so didn't try anything with that; they seem to have the widest variety of any menu I've ever seen. Service was friendly and helpful. All the food here is EXTREMELY rich, a little to rich for me. Hence 4* not 5*. Still, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Made reservations weeks in advance and it is worth It. A foodie must.  The service was excellent and the wine list is great."}
{"text":"Avec une rÃ©putation comme celle que a Le Pied de Cochon j'avais hÃ¢te de dÃ©couvrir ce petit restaurant situe sur la rue Duluth. CommenÃ§ons par le dÃ©cor; trÃ¨s beau et rustique avec la cuisine a air ouvert c'est trÃ¨s chaleureux. Pour se qui est du service aucun mauvais commentaire notre serveur Ã©tait passionnÃ© et attentionnÃ©. Maintenant pour la bouffe vÃ©gÃ©tarien s'abstenir! Il faut aimer la viande et les plats trÃ¨s copieux! Il a fallut que j'essaye la fameuse Poutine au foie gras nous Ã©tions 2 sur le plat et c'Ã©tait plus que assez les plat son trÃ¨s gouteux mais trÃ¨s lourds je dois dire que j'ai Ã©tÃ© un peu dÃ©Ã§u. Mais je ne regrette pas d'y Ãªtre aller et je le recommande a n'importe qui mais je n'irai pas manger au Pied de Cochon Ã  chaque Week End."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great foie gras. We strolled over on a Saturday night and got a table right away (party of 2, do not try with a group: 6 people right behind us were told it was about a 2-month wait for group reservations...). We opted for the smallest seafood platter, followed by a \"foie gras tout nu\" (\"bare naked foie gras\", which actually comes on a bread and a balsamic vinegar reduction), and the must-have \"canard en conserve\" (\"duck in a can\"). Definitely too much food for the 2 of us, but it was hard not to want to order everything on the menu.  Good to know:  - for reservations, call the restaurant and leave a message with your reservation information; they will then call you back to confirm so plan ahead. We tried same-day and we didn't get a call back but walk-in worked. If you are a group, be sure to call a couple of months in advance. - the cans of \"canard en conserve\" at the entrance of the restaurant are for display only."}
{"text":"I'm torn about my experience at au pied du cochon!  I really wanted to like it - whats not to like about poutine and foie gras and duck in a can and pigs feet.  But yikes, there is a limit to how much fat and salt one can stuff in their mouth.  So our waiter was awesome - no complaints there, he screwed up some orders and gave us more expensive wine but didn't end up charging for any of his mistakes.  However there was a 2 hour wait in between our shared appetizers and our main courses.  For starters (my favourite part of the meal - we should've just got up and left after a bottle of wine and the shared dishes, then it would've been +2 stars) we shared the famous foie gras poutine which was mouth watering delicious and heavenly.  We also shared a delicious beet/goat cheese salad and the beef tongue.  We were still hungry as we waited for appetizers and almost finished the 2nd bottle of wine until the food came.  There was 8 girls whom each ordered one main each - I had the pig's feet covered in cream and salt, a friend had the duck in a can, another had the melting pot, another had the salmon, and some had the special of the day.  All of us probably touched or could finish 1/4 of the meal at the most until we reached out tolerance of fat, salt and carbs.  You know when you don't even want to put foie gras in your mouth, that something is seriously wrong.  I LOVE fat and salt and carbs, but there is such thing as a limit when there's more fat and salt than you can taste any other ingredient, at which point I really felt like throwing up.  The sentiment was the same across the table.  But I guess when I looked around, other people really did finish their meal.  Unless I have a death wish of an instant heart attack, I think au pied de cochon takes it too much to the extreme of excess and it was just too much for me.  It didn't help with the long wait and the screw ups in orders and bill too.  I'd recommend going JUST for the foie gras poutine to share then leave."}
{"text":"If money was less of a concern, and TSA promised not to fondle me at DCA, I'd fly to Montreal every weekend for this place. The French Canadians get some bad rep for being, well, the things they chose to be. But this one restaurant in itself, and everything yummy as fuck listed on their little paper menus, redeems every nasty slur, every pompous comment, and every smelly elevator ride.  The food here is some of the best I've ever had. It's not simple, it's rather complex, and loud. They have a way of making the flavours step out. Think about this for a second, large Montreal clams in a thick cheesy white beer sauce! It's clams + cheese + hoegaarden beer. The duck is great, and since you're at a restaurant called au pied du cochon, I'd recommend some pork for the main course. You will enjoy the dessert twice, once when you eat it and the second (reminiscing in bed.  Granted, they turned me away the last time I visited Montreal in an annoying French Canadian accent (Monsieur, no reservation -no entry), but this time around I made reservations well in advance, showed up on time in a nice shirt - still waiting, half an hour, but eventually got in."}
{"text":"Perfect restaurant for crazy food, and unique type of food  good vibe of Poaple my favourite plate is duck in the can"}
{"text":"Please note, you should eat VERY light for about 2 days before heading to the Cabane a sucre PDC so you'll stand a chance at trying all of the foie-gras and maple-slathered deliciousness.   The 2013 season Sugar Shack menu started out with a dessert tower which included maple cotton candy, some of the best amandines I've ever tasted and jack-maple shots....a great start!  The entrees included a smoked salmon, foie-gras/lardons crepes, foie-gras omelette topped with veal brain, balsamic-maple glazed deep-fried duck legs, arugula and duck heart salad topped with traditional cabane a sucre \"oreilles de cris\". The mains consisted of a full chicken (head and feet included) stuffed with lobster and foie-gras and a giant ham ...not for the unadventurous palate but cooked in such a way as to be rich, decadent and very appetizing.   We also opted for the $70 special tourtiÃ¨re option - an exercise in gluttony but delicious!  There were also maple-themed cocktails. We had a few pitchers of maple beer, which was quite good and had a nice maple after-taste.   The desserts were a very rich cake which was good, but didn't seem very special after all we'd just ingested, and of course, their version of \"tire sur la neige\". The maple syrup was served on vanilla ice cream and was a definite highlight of the meal!  The atmosphere was crowded and boisterous, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the \"doggy-bags\" were necessary and much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Un incontournable Ã  MontrÃ©al!  Ce n'est un resto vÃ©gÃ©tarien mais les plats sont excellents et gÃ©nÃ©reux.  J'y vais souvent avec des amis et mes enfants. C'est toujours un repas rÃ©ussi Ã  condition de ne pas trop manger."}
{"text":"A recent compliment from another Yelper reminded me that I haven't reviewed this place on Yelp yet. So thanks Betty B for reminding me!  I have a friend who grew up in Montreal (he speaks fluent French, Italian & English) who told a work colleague and I to spend the weekend in Montreal with him after attending a conference in Toronto for the week. We took him up on his offer and this dining extravaganza was the culinary highlight of the trip.  This was just before the ban on foie gras went into effect in California, so our friend took us here to make sure we could overload on it...and we did.  There was so much that looked so good on the menu, three grown men wept with joy and giggled like schoolgirls.  Even though it's not on the menu right now, the foie gras with maple syrup was amazing. We then dove straight into a second foie gras dish,  naked foie gras.  Our third foie gras foray was the foie gras poutine...NOT to be missed!  Then we had a pig dish and the Fowl for 2, which put us over the top. They were both completely off the hook. The whole chicken had a morel mushroom gravy that was so good you could have filled a coffee mug full of it and drank it straight down.  The wines?  Oh...the wines...   Their French wine selection was ridiculously amazing. We guzzled bottle after bottle with our meal like we were with Bacchus himself.  Then came the desserts. It may have been the foie gras delirium, but each one was better than the last. We ordered three, struggled to finish them, but we had to because they were so good.  Hours after we got there, we stumbled outside feeling sated & slightly sinful at the end of this magnificent foie gras feast.   Bottom line? If you are within 500 miles of Montreal, make a trip to the wonderful city and this deliciously decadent restaurant. You'll thank me if you do."}
{"text":"Our group of four was able to get an early dinner reservation. This place is booked far in advance and you can see why when you experience the food.   First we got there and while walking through the dining area, the floors were extremely slippery.  The hostess actually warned us to be careful.  I guess with the open kitchen and the amount of cooking they do, the floor is hard to maintain.   We started with a seafood platter that blew my mind.  This is not typical seafood that's cleaned and thrown on a bed of ice.  The items in this platter were carefully prepared combinations of sauces to ingredients married together in tasty bliss.  There were cooked snails in sauce, mini sea snails, sea urchin in light foam sauce, oysters, and more.  I love how each piece was a creation in itself.  I would go back just to try the other seafood platters.   On the proteins.  Seared foie gras with a maple syrup sauce is to die for.  The syrup stands strong with the foie gras flavor and blends together nicely.  The duck in a can was a combination of the best parts of the duck (more foie gras) and duck breast, in a rich sauce.  We also had the pig's foot, which normally my wife would not like, but this one had so many flavors working with it that it's simply amazing.  Everything exceeded my expectations.  And I would go back to try the other stuff I didn't get to.    If you're in Montreal, you must go. Book far in advance."}
{"text":"Great meal - rich and heavy, but thoughtful service and advice made it a great experience. We had the foie gras poutine and the pork chop for two - and (barely) saved room for the maple creme brulee...  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My fiance saw this on an episode of \"No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain\" and wanted to try it. He called the morning that we planned to eat there and managed to get a reservation for two for the bar. We were probably VERY lucky to even get that, because the place was packed, and there was a line out the door when we arrived. The hostess asked if we preferred a French or an English menu (English, please!) and quickly seated us. There was not a lot of room at the bar but it was not at all uncomfortable. Coats and purses can be hung on small hooks in front of your knees - very convenient since waiters and patrons are always running around in back of you, and since there is about four feet of space between the back of your bar chair and more dining tables. We were actually seated right by a kitchen/work area, so we saw a few appetizers being prepared. The staff was right there but we didn't seem to be in each others' way.   He ordered the foie gras cromesquis for an appetizer ... we intended on sharing it, but were informed that it can only be eaten by one person, since you basically have to put the entire thing in your mouth and let it \"explode.\" Since I was not too comfortable with the idea of foie gras in the first place, I didn't order one for myself ... he said it was creamy and delicious and was an excellent start to the meal. We also got a basket of very yummy bread, perhaps sourdough? He got a draft beer and I was fine with tap water (we were offered tap or mineral by the waiter).    Our entrees came out quickly ... duck magret in mushroom sauce for him, and the \"happy pork chop\" (a large, thick pork chop cooked with mushrooms, onions and red cabbage) for me. Absolutely delicious. I wanted to pick up my bowl and lick it clean of the wonderful sauce. One minor annoyance was that I got a bit of bone in my very first bite and had to find a discreet way to dispose of it, which was not easy with my cloth napkin. We also got a paper cone of pommes frites, which we could not finish because we were stuffed from dinner.   Parking was a GIANT bother. We literally circled the area for over an hour, and got very frustrated and almost canceled our reservation. There appears to be only Resident Parking available on the side streets (we weren't sure since we don't speak French and all the street signs were in French), and Rue Duluth is a very narrow street with limited parking only available on one side. There also did not appear to be any pay lots within walking distance. We finally found a metered spot on a perpendicular street, which actually turned out to be a fantastic spot because we were only about three buildings away from the restaurant. However, the pay meter was quite confusing (even with an English Translation button) and wouldn't take more than a $2 coin from us. Since it was 8:50 p.m., I had a theory that paid parking might expire at 9 p.m. ... fiance went to ask a woman in a chocolate shop next to Au Pied De Cochon about the parking rules, and she confirmed that we didn't have to pay for parking after 9 p.m.  So since she helped us, I must also throw in praise for her chocolate shop. I forget the name, but we bought two pieces of chocolate to patronize her shop after her kind help. The chocolates weren't much bigger than the $2 coins that each of them cost, but they were quite good ... so if you want a little sweet after your meal, head here and get one. I had the caramel chocolate - very good, I'm wondering if it was a truffle.   So - Au Pied De Cochon in a nutshell - delicious food, good service, call ahead in advance (lots of advance) for a table reservation, and look for parking SUPER early ... or better yet, just take a cab."}
{"text":"You definitely need a reservation in advance as they get fully booked, which also means not needing to line up!  Duck in a can was as delicious as expected and it comes with foie gras so you can technically skip on ordering a separate foie gras dish. Foie gras poutine was not as good in comparison, the foie we got there was less fatty and fragrant, so I wouldn't recommend that one."}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed by the restaurant! The dishes are not balanced at all! a great chef knows how to balance the experience through multiple courses of different flavor and tones; that's the main reason of having more one course after all!  At Pied de cochon they serve monotonic fatty dishes from starter to desert. there is nothing in any dishes that balance the fat with a bit of acidity.   And I'm not gonna talk about health factor. Bottom line it's fancy junk food!"}
{"text":"Had two meals at the PDC Sugar Shack (winter 2014 and winter 2015) and the experiences were quite different. The food is decadent, delicious, and plentiful. The service on the second outing really subtracted from the meal. Half portions were brought out late or entirely forgotten (easy to notice since tables beside you are eating the same meal), and then delivered to the wrong table. I was unsure if it was the kitchen or the servers who were responsible - but either way, what ends up being a $100 a plate meal became quite disappointing considering the hype, expectations, and previous experience.   That all being said, the meal of 2014 was great!"}
{"text":"Warning... don't come near this place if you're on a diet or if you don't like very rich dishes. Definitely don't step foot in this place unless you LOVE foie gras. And make sure to make reservations in advance... I made reservations three weeks before my trip to Montreal and had to settle for a later seating because this place is just that popular.   I love that it's not pretentious and quite casual. The food gosh I don't know where to start... the only description for it is it's like having an orgasm in your mouth. The foie gras poutine, duck in a can and foie gras potato pancake with maple syrup were so unbelievably good that my boyfriend and I practically licked our plates clean. We were stuffed beyond belief but we ordered dessert anyways and lets just say we were speechless. The pot of chocolate was so good we once again wanted to lick the jar clean.   We tried to make reservations for another night while we were there since the food was so divine... unfortunately they were booked solid for the week."}
{"text":"Everything you read.... Everything they said... It's all true. There isn't much more to say other than have an open mind, make reservations in advance, and pace yourself so there's room for dessert. We loved every single crumb and morsel. The bread and butter, the charcuterie drizzled with olive oil and maple syrup, the cocktails.... All were amazing. We had the artichoke ravioli which will probably not be on your menu as this was a special of the evening. We also had the 'shepards pie' or PatÃ© chinoise. Wow. It was sooo rich, creamy, savory and even sweet with the creamy corn layer. The melted meat bits were perfectly seasoned. The creme brulee was crisply charred but not burned. I would drive another 5 hours for dinner there, that's how much I loved this restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome. The bread is great, the appetizers were great, the main courses were great. Try the pied de cochon or the duck in the can. If you like foie gras, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  I got the foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can.  Maybe it's just me but I found both to be a bit salty but they gave us plenty of bread to enjoy it.    The foie gras poutine was delicious.  I can not really describe it since it was my first time trying foie gras but I loved this.  It was the perfect amount.  Duck in a Can also had foie gras in it.  It was very flavourful.    Our waitress was so nice, we ordered water and our glass was never half empty!  As I mentioned above, my brother kept asking for bread and she happily brought it to us."}
{"text":"I'll begin by saying you shouldn't even consider this restaurant unless you're a diehard carnivore. Now that I have that out of the way...  My husband and I started the meal with the whelks appetizer. It was the first time either of us had tried this shellfish and we were blown away. The snails had been removed from the shell, cleaned, chopped and replaced in the shell then baked  in the wood-fired oven with garlic, breadcrumbs and butter.  My husband had the boudin and fois gras with puff pastry for his entree. The portion was plenty for two to share especially considering the richness of the dish. I had the pork shank with risotto, another dish that could easily be split by two diners. The pork was tender and  delicious. However it was outdone by the gravy...so delicious I can't stop thinking about it.   We had pecan pie and ice cream for dessert...this time we decided to share!  Both aspects of the dish were great (and as a native southerner, I'm a born expert on pecan pie).  Wait staff was plentiful and buzzed around like bees since the restaurant was full the whole time we were there.  The only downside was the uncomfortably warm dining room (in all fairness the day was unseasonably warm in Montreal).  We were able to find street parking a block away. Be careful as much of the parking is reserved for neighborhood residents."}
{"text":"I ordered the guinea hen liver to start, F-ING FANTASTIC!  Do not leave this restaurant unless you have ordered this.  For the main, I had the foie gras poutine which I thought was small at first, but whoa, it was filling. My wife had the duck-in-a-can.  It was rich and yummy, but she has a sophisticated palate and wasn't totally impressed, but still liked it.  She added that if the duck-in-a-can came with a more complex, interesting side versus potatoes spread on toast.  I recommend getting reservations at the kitchen counter early, maybe a couple days ahead.  Bottom line is this resto is really good.  The dishes are rich and flavorful and the servers are friendly and very, very helpful.  GO."}
{"text":"If you like foie gras this is the place for you. Most of their menu items will contain foie gras, exceptionally well prepared foie gras.   But as good as foie gras is, sometimes it is a little much. One item would be the foie gras burger, a beautifully seared piece of foie placed in a cheese burger. I feel it just gets lost in it.   However there are dishes like the duck in a can and the pig's foot where it all makes sense and comes together wonderfully. I highly recommend getting the pig's foot over the famous duck in a can. It's just so much better. And be sure to split it. It's hardly a dish for one.  A seat at the bar gives you a front row seat to all the action. Great if you want to see how things are prepared and plated."}
{"text":"No! No! No! I though I was going to die after eating such rich food.  We had: 1) the poutine (just the right amount of sauce). 2) A PDC Pork Chop (truly with a huge, caveman-like bone) with a divine sliced red cabbage sauce. 3) Duck Magret heaped generously with mushrooms  Wine selection was a terrific cotes du rhone which was full-bodied and just a little bit of acidity to keep it tasting fresh.  This is not \"fine dining\" but rather a celebration of robust, complex flavors. Quite frankly I prefer it that way.   After leaving this restaurant my face started flushing, either of happiness or because my blood pressure rose from all the rich butter and gravy in my system--I'd like to think it was the former"}
{"text":"Had reservation for a family of 5. Was seated promptly. service started out decent, but turned bad when they claimed one of their chefs got injured, which caused our main courses to take 45 min to arrive. Had the following:  Poutine foie gras - tasted good, nothing spectacular Lasagne - too salty, mish-mash glob of stuff. not recommended Jambon - presentation was the highlight, tasted ok Pain de viande (meatloaf) - another mish-mash of meat - not recommended, too salty, extremely rice in flavor."}
{"text":"Surement le restaurant le plus connu de MontrÃ©al ! Une carte typiquement quÃ©bÃ©coise, de qualitÃ© excellente, un service des plus sympathique, et tout Ã§a pour des prix finalement tout Ã  fait raisonnables (du moins bien en deÃ§a de ce que je m'imaginais)  Alors, pour gouter Ã  la pure cuisine quÃ©bÃ©coise, c'est lÃ  qu'il faut aller et profiter de cet endroit formidable !  Attention, rÃ©server Ã  l'avance est juste obligatoire !!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Quebec style food is not very easy to find.  Poutine, perhaps a Quebec original, is very easy to find here.  But old fashioned dishes developed when New France's older days don't exist much.  This resto is an authentic Quebec original.  There is nothing like this in Paris, New york,  New Orleans-anywhere.  Very very rich sauces, lots of foie gras, amazing array of creative and in your face carnivore fair is what makes this place one of Bourdin's favorites and mine too.  The place is all about celebration.  Food and wine are great and interesting.  Here are some things I ahve had over the years:   Duck in a can:  an amazing duch dish that's been placed in a can. 7 out of 10 Bison tongue; delicious white and brown sauce with a taragon hint:  9 of 10 Boudin tart;  blood sausage in a pie-great appetizer;  8 of 10 Beet salad:  Well prepared 7.5 of 10 Fish:  they have fish specials that rotate, I only ate once:  8 of 10 amazingly Duck:  I once had their 1/2 duck for 2:  9 of 10 Pied de Cochon with foie gras:  Rich and over the top   7 of 10 Poutine with foie gras:  I am not a big fan of poutine, but many love htis dish:  5 of 10 Steak:  Overcooked at my friends insistance  3 of 10-not a steak house here  The restaurant is about celebration of food and wine.  Go for a great and unique experience."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Montreal.   Unique, delicious and so so filling. Its very easy to over indulge with foie gras as the topping of many dishes."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times but the best experience is to sit at the bar and watch the magic happen! Need to go back but I just hate reserving ahead of time. A must try if you're checking out the Montreal food scene. Just know that it's decadence at its best!"}
{"text":"Ok, first let me say the food was good. However, the service was adequate at best and it was like eating in the middle of Grand Central Station... Very noisy, chaotic, and people bumping into my chair constantly because there place is small and they try to get as many people in as possible. The bathroom is also sandwiched  between the kitchen and bar which I feel was kind of weird. Also if you don't speak French it is difficult to read the menu and the waitress had trouble understanding our questions. I think there are many other options in Montreal where you can enjoy a pleasant dinner and great food."}
{"text":"This was the best meal of my life. To start with our server Greg was amazing. Patient in helping us create a meal, attentive, witty, and even did a shot of brandy with us to celebrate our honeymoon. The place is perfect in its feel: come as you are, and be prepared to eat unabashedly rich and descendent food made with love and attention to detail.  Our fois on a buckwheat pancake with chÃ¨vre and corn immediately blew our minds. The canned duck was the star of the evening, with a pairing of flavors I could not even begin to describe to do it justice. Savory, sweet, acid, age and lots of delicious fat.  All of the food is rich to be sure. Don't expect to walk away feeling light and fresh. But if you want eat at a place where the program is centered around good food, good people, good wine, and good music, you cannot beat Au pied."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Martin Picard really crafted a masterful menu that embodies the Montreal spirit. It transports you into a dimly lit cabin in the mountains. The neo rustic style of cooking really shines through from dishes such a duck in a can to a whole head of pig.   They start you off with a made from scratch baguette, that has a insane crust. The crackle it makes when you break into it to the fluffy interior made it easily top 5 pieces of bread I've eaten. They serve it with fresh regional butter.   Next, the foie gras poutine.  The most iconic dish of Montreal. It might as well be on the flag right next to the fleur de lis. Then combined with gently sautÃ©ed foie gras to maintain that rich, creaminess.   BOOM. Taste buds have just been assaulted. The chicken gravy is thick and the cheese curds have that squeaky snap that we all look for.   I proceeded to think it was a great idea to order an entire pig's head next. Apparently, it had a lobster in it's mouth too. Some artistic ish. Despite the presentation, the meat was tender and the skin was crispy. If I had to guess, they roasted it. They also took the lobster tail, and made a soup. Wasn't too much a fan of the soup as it was really salty. Brain with liquid lemon butter on a crostini was next and it did not disappoint. The creamy texture was very pleasant with slightly tart butter. The tongue was so broken down that it would just break apart when poking with a fork.   Delicious  Also, they brew their own beer"}
{"text":"It was delicious but extremely filling - I'll be sure to split a regular in the future.  I could see this as being the perfect hang over cure!  Very busy but open 24hr"}
{"text":"This place is pretty pricey so I picked my birthday to come here. I was afraid it would be stuffy, but it actually seemed like a place you could go to every night (if you are loaded). The place has a robust and homey feelling atmosphere and the tables are not seated to close together so you can have a private conversation. There is lots of foie gras on the menu and also game. My bf had the bison ribs and it came out on a rib that must have been like 2 feet long. I had lamb shank which was very tasty.  I went to the bathroom, and there was a TV in there and lots of beer on ice. I asked what it was for and was told that it was so you could catch a bit of the hockey game, there was an important game on. You could lock yourself in there and sit and drink beer and watch the game - how great is that! Sort of a quirky idea, awesome. I was surprised there was no line. There seemed to be a lot of regulars, our waiter seemed to stop for little chats here and there."}
{"text":"The foie gras poutine is to die for!  It's a must order in my books.  Crispy duck fat fries with a large slab of foie gras.  The duck in a can was a bit overrated in my opinion. I'd skip the novelty of it and try the duck entree instead.  Great atmosphere, very lively."}
{"text":"The froie gras poutine is even more delicious than the reviews described. Fries are cooked perfectly, gravy is rich but not heavy, and the froie gras creamy, silky, and delicious. It was more than worth the mile walk through the snow!"}
{"text":"Go to this place for the best heart attack food you'll ever try.  Highlights were the fois gras poutine and bone marrow with maple syrup. I didn't get a chance to try the famous \"duck in a can\" which was far more expensive than I was willing to pay for.   I was a bit disappointed with the cramped casual tables and seating area. The bathroom has a stylized pig trough with artisan bars of soap.   Check out Anthony Bourdain's feature on this resto - it's hilarious esp. the line that went something like \"feed him more and when he dies, stop.\" That pretty much sums up the experience."}
{"text":"This is the cream of the crop of what Montreal has to offer. We are very lucky to have such amazing food here and APDC has been a frontrunner for years. I have been a few times and I simply cannot find one bad thing to say about it. Fantastic food, fantastic drinks, fantastic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dining highlight of our trip to Montreal, and one of the best dinners I've had in a very, very long time.  Au Pied de Cochon (or APDC as so many fondly term it) is truly amazing and a must-visit for any true foodie. Reservations are hard to come by, but I managed to snag a 9:30 pm Friday night reservation calling a few days before. Also, we were in the area and stopped by at 8:30 pm with low expectations of being seated early... but the host graciously sat us within 10 minutes! Great start to a great evening.  The restaurant is lively and bustling, and actually quite a bit more casual than I anticipated. Lovely to have fantastic food without a stuffy ambiance. It's a wonderfully cheery place, warmed by the alluring smell of French cooking wafting throughout the restaurant. Waiters were friendly and eager to give recommendations.  The Foodnalysis: - Foie Gras Cromesquis - Absolutely delicious. These truffle-sized treats are eaten in one bite. The fried, crispy exterior gives way to a savory burst of liquid... really amazing and unique. - Bison Tongue - Tender, delicious.  Don't let the word 'tongue' scare you off from this fantastic appetizer. - Duck in a Can - Flavorful, filling, fatty, fantastic... and many other \"f\" adjectives. Their signature dish, the Duck in a Can, is a breast and foie gras paired and hosts of other great tasting items sealed in a can then boiled to perfection. The waiter literally brings out a can and opens it, pouring out the rich, steaming contents before your very eyes. It's great and unique, definitely a must-try.  - Foie Gras Poutine - As an American (and an Asian one at that), poutine is not something my taste buds are accustomed to. But Foie Gras Poutine was my best attempt at being French Canadian during this meal! Very rich, and a little much considering I shared some of the Duck in a Can. - Oven Baked Apple - Sweet, but not overly sugarly. Baked just the right amount of time to achieve that perfect, soft texture.  A nice end to a rich meal.  The Bottom Line: The perfect Montreal dinner spot with amazing food. Make an early reservation and try the Foie Gras Comesquis, Bison Tongue and Duck in a Can for a truly unique dining experience!"}
{"text":"The food here is very rich/heavy.  We ordered: Appetizer - Foie Gras Cromesquis (2 pieces of fried bread cubes with foie gras inside) nice and small appetizer. Appetizer - Tuna tartare this was a special item. I'm not a fan of tuna tartar with olive oil, prefer it with some lime juice instead. The oil overpowers the fish Appetizer - Poutine gave it a try while in Montreal. Not a fan its french fries with gravy and cheese that does not melt The duck in can - this was literally a duck (1/4 of a duck?) comes with some vegetables and foie gras. Rich meal, but not as much as I would have imagined for $44.  Overall the food was fine. Be prepared for a heavy/rich meal."}
{"text":"I ordered their foie gras nigiri and all I can say is - holy dank! It's super delicious! Foie gras on top of rice with maple butter in the middle. This is seriously one of the best foods I've ever eaten.  If you come to Montreal, try this restaurant out. You will not be disappointed. It was a busy night when I went but I was seated right away. The staff were friendly and accommodating. Ambiance is good except the space is a little tight and the noice level is too high for me.   Since the restaurant is more on the classy side, the price is a little expensive although I must say you get your money's worth.   Truly a wonderful food experience for me!"}
{"text":"We ordered one of everything that was left to split for dinner. The poutine with foie gras was decadent (small portion, small price). The duck was just wonderful. The pork bun (beigne) was absolutely delicious! The only down point was the rhubarb doughnut that tasted more of apple than rhubarb. Service was with a smile and quick. We'll be hunting this truck again and again. Martin Picard does it again."}
{"text":"A restaurant for foodies, with a reputation that precedes your reservation and ultimate arrival. There were two of us, and we were marking the end of summer. A special dinner.   We arrived at six and it was busy but not full. Many families with children, surprisingly. I describe it as casual chic. Know the address as there is no sign outdoors.   Gluten free was a challenge but not insurmountable. We had a lovely salad followed by bison (me) & pork chop. Huge portions, quite the opposite of Los Angeles establishments of similar quality and reputation.   As it got busier out server was much less attentive. I had to remind him of our wine and then ask for the bill. We didn't seem important enough to warrant his attention, a mistake in my opinion.   Wondering if it is worthy of its elevated status. Lots of other interesting places nearby that I may try before returning."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to in the world. Foie gras poutine was awsome. The entrees here were individual and all delicious."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but the food was too heavy for us. We had to try Duck in a Can because it seemed too interesting but was a bit disappointed. It was too greasy. The service was extremely slow; we waited almost an hour between our appetizer, which was the gnocchi pesto, and our main dish."}
{"text":"Wow! This restaurant deserves the 5 stars I'm giving it.   Service:  Very great. Staff was very attentive, friendly, and welcoming. There were 3 different servers tending to us (I think because it was a very busy night, and servers were covering multiple tables), but it didn't feel like they were overwhelming us with questions if we needed anything, or in any way intrusive.   Food:  Foie Gras Burger - thick burger. Doesn't come with any sides...just the burger. Coming in at a hefty price of $39 bucks, I wouldn't know if it was worth it. The foie gras slice is decent amount, but I probably wouldn't order it again. But don't worry, it's a pretty big burger so you'll leave full.   Pigs feet stuffed with foie gras - this was really really really worth it! Definitely something to share with one or two friends. The pig feet actually came with mashed potatoes on sides and there was a little mushroom/rosemary/carrot/gravy moat around the giant pig feet 'castle'. A couple slices of foie gras were on top of the pigs foot. Honestly, there wasn't as much foie gras in this entree as I though...but the sheer amount of pigs foot definitely made up for it!   Final thoughts:  Takes about 30 min to bring out the pigs foot. There was a little hiccup in the cooking process which tacked on bout 20 min more BUT the restaurant was nice enough and considerate enough to bring out a complimentary dish of ravioli and artichoke hearts so I could eat with my other friends together since their burgers came out earlier. Very considerate and definitely enjoyed it.   I would come back in a heartbeat. Definitely a cute place to bring a date. Just make sure it's not the first date, cuz you'll be setting the bar real high. Wallet was noticeably lighter after this meal!"}
{"text":"Does another review make a difference at this point? There's so many! But def go check this place out if you're in Montreal. Hubby and I still talk about the duck after almost 2 years of being there! Must get the duck from the can. I need to go back just for that."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this incredible altar to excess and indulgence?    I read most of these reviews and looked at all the pictures to best plan out my first meal.  From the get go I wanted to ensure that I had a whole meal from beginning to end  So to start I strategically had the \"Cromesquis de foie gras\" (aka dried cubes of FG that pop in your mouth when you eat them!!) along side the \"Salade de Bleu, pommes, endives\" which could have been an entire meal all in itself.  Huge chunks of pungent blue cheese, walnuts and a creamy dressing was a great way to start.  After that I had the \"Canard en conserve\"...how could I not after all the pictures and reviews?  It was my first time there and I wanted to go with a real winner.  Its everything everybody says about it and more.  From presentation to texture to flavor all I can say is YES  Desert was perfect way to cap off such a intense meal.  I chose to go with the \"Poire pochÃ©e et glace vanille \" wich I was (pleasantly) surprised to find was served cold and it capped off things nicely.  My final Top Tip would be to leave the car at home and forget about the taxi...jump on the subway to get to the restaurant.  The walk back to the station at the end of the meal will do you some good!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant!!!!  We had the duck in a can which is a must order.  We had the goose liver beignets, tuna tartare amazing .... Everything was superb!!!  Make a reservation early!!!  Go eat, enjoy, drink ....live!!!  :-)"}
{"text":"Visit Montreal for a weekend and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Not too hard: I left a voicemail and someone called me back the next day.   Between my friend and I, we ordered:  - cromesquis de foie gras, basically deep fried fg. For $4, it was worth it.   - temaki tartare, tartare Japanese hand roll. They didn't have bison available and we were offered veal. I quite enjoyed the layers of flavour and texture.   - carpaccio de canard, duck carpaccio. My second favorite of the night.   - and finally, poutine au foie gras. I hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment. I'm a fan of fg but this didn't have the ah-ha for me.   We went later in the evening and 2 of the 3 cocktails were already sold out. My reco would be to go early.   We also had a lot of trouble finding this place late at night. You really have to know what the front looks like!"}
{"text":"It was good enough for Anthony Bourdain, so it had to be good enough for us, right?  RIGHT.  Took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner and because we love good food and don't mind splurging for it. We heard this place was one of the best in Montreal, and Bourdain praised it on his travel show, No Reservations. We HAD to try it.  Every single thing was insanely delicious, from the cubed foie gras starter to the \"Duck in a Can\" and buffalo tartare entrees to the espresso and creme brulee for dessert. Not a word was said as every tiny morsel was savored in complete ecstasy by us both. it was quite honestly the best meal we have ever had. Seriously.  Ever since our brush with culinary greatness, we joke around saying, \"hey, we should totally jump on a plane right now and eat at Au Pied!!!\" but seriously, we would actually do it if we had the funds. Fly to Montreal, eat, fly back. That's all we'd ever need."}
{"text":"Duck. Pork. Foie Gras. This place tried to kill me. I barely made it out alive. The duck-in-a-can was awesome (duck + foie gras). The gravy and foie gras on top of fries. The fried pork skin. Crikey. Great dinner. Reminds me a lot of Animal in LA (or vice versa)"}
{"text":"This restaurant reputation is well known as such it is always packed and reservation days ahead is required. Every dish is very rich and heavy, with much focus on foie gras; tasty and saucy, maybe not always flavorful and lacking in presentation. Make sure you have decent appetite before going in, otherwise just piggy back your leftovers. Seating is very tight and loud, however waiter service is excellent. Not suitable for vegans."}
{"text":"If I could only have one meal in Montreal, tres tragic, it would be here!  First, don't eat anything after your morning cafe and pain au chocolate, even if you can only get a 1030 reservation at the bar, THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE!  We watched with amazement as one tantalizing dish after another rolled past us on its way to another happy table of diners.  Whole roasted legs de cochon, on platters so large they required two servers to carry them out, tables full of visiting chefs happy to have gotten a reservation plenty of noise and amazing aromas and service as if they knew you by name. First, the little molten foie gras cube, that despite repeated warnings, shot droplets through my closed lips and onto my napkin.  We ordered the pig's foot, (more like half a leg) and the canard conserve (canned duck), either one of which would have satisfied two diners and took our server's advice to have only half an order of the Poutine with Foie gras.  We decided after devouring it that it was the only bad advice we got! We could not possibly finish, so we packed away a beautiful picnic to take on our climb to the top of Mount Royal then next day, and moved on to dessert, a classic Quebecois maple pudding which came out bubbling hot from the oven.  We walked nearly three miles back to our hotel in the Chinese Quarter deciding what wine and cheese to take along on the next day's picnic, and happy that birthday's come but once a year."}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype about this restaurant. It IS one of the most famous places to dine in Montreal, and I can see why. The food is succulent, rich, and flavorful. The items on the menu would make any carnivore salivate, and perhaps any vegetarian cover their eyes and plug their nose. However, there are a few tasty salad options (and a catch of the day -  no, not me!) for those who don't get excited about tucking into a plate of pork, beef, poultry, bison, deer or foie gras \"fat liver\"! The atmosphere is busy, but cosy and a lil romantic. The problem is that because it is so busy and popular, the food comes out a snails pace. My friends and I waited an hour for our appetizers and another hour for our meals. If you're in great company (and you have a bottle of wine on the go), the wait time isn't all that annoying or noticeable, but I'd advise not to go on an empty stomach, unless of course you want to fill up on foie gras poutine. Oh, it exists - but only here!"}
{"text":"This is easily among the top meals I've eaten in my life and absolutely definitely the best VALUE meal I've seen period.   At $63 Canadian and an hour drive outside of Montreal I had a few last minute doubts. This is a dinner I've been anticipating for years so it was going to be hard to meet the crazy expectations....but it did!!!  Hard to write a review that helps anyone except those going for this seasons menu as it changes so dramatically, but here are some notes that are probably useful across seasons:  -The server told us that there'd be way too much food to finish and there'd be plenty of to go boxes.   -Every course is incredibly rich. Think about sampling before you throw yourself at any individual dish.   -Try the cocktails! We especially liked the gin-maple syrup and gin-rhubarb drinks. If the meal hadn't been so filling the raspberry daiquiri is remarkably refreshing. Note it probably doesn't make sense to order more than one given how filling everything is.   -Dessert is a full on fireworks show finale! As absolutely delicious as everything is make sure you save space as there is both a crazy quantity of it and it is delicious. This seasons carrot cake (crunchy with pumpkin seeds) and apple pie stuffed with almond cream and apple purÃ©e are truly standout.   -Don't arrive early for your reservation. There really isn't anywhere to wait.   This is a meal worth both flying and or leaving the country for! I'll be marking my calendar for December 1 to get myself in that lottery for sugar season reservations!"}
{"text":"First course was  similar to a Monte Cristi sandwich, except on brioche bread coated in maple syrup that caramelized it OMG. Next followed the whole cochon appetizer plate, four pates, head cheese, sausages, with crustinis. Fabulous is the only way to explain it. I started to feel my stomach getting full but knew I had to persevere, the main entree hadn't arrived yet. So on to the poutine, french fries, gravy, cheese and buttery foie gras. And for the final dish duck in a can. Sounds strange but it was wonderful.  The service was great. Next visit to Montreal I'm ordering the pig head confit. Yes an entire head brought to the table to enjoy. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Holy momma!! Food was amazing, service was excellent. Real French cuisine with a touch of everything. The foie gras with the maple syrup and bacon is a must try. I died eating it......twice. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"duck in the can... I know it sounds disgusting but it's amazing!"}
{"text":"APDC has been my #1  favorite dining within the 3 yrs I've travelled to Montreal for dragonboating.  In spite of how tremendously busy they are, the staff dish out not only fabulous dishes but awesome service.  We had a slight mix-up in our reservations b/c we made changes which weren't all updated.  But the hostess adjusted & squeezed our entire party of 12 to table of 8 & table of 4.  My smaller table ordered the cromesquis de foie gras (absolute favorite), pied de cochon and canard en conserve.  There was not one dripping of sauce or morsel of meat left on any of the plates.    I am definitely coming back each time I'm in Montreal.  Well-worth the $ & if reservations made in advance, no worries about long wait.  They are VERY prompt, meaning don't be late or your seats will go fast.  This is a small but cozy restaurant with no real waiting area except the sidewalk.    Already excited about what to order next year... cromesquis de foie gras.. what a molten explosion in your mouth!   But also dying to try the other foie gras dishes, especially the hamburger de foie gras!      Merci Ã  Marc pour une expÃ©rience wonderous dans cet Ã©tablissement savoureux!   You are the coolest gentleman and your hospitality is most appreciated! Merci beaucoup!"}
{"text":"This is not a spot for a romantic night out with your honey as it's fabulously busy with an open kitchen, dynamic wait staff and full of people. Every dish was huge so plan to share. We ordered the charcuterie and the prosciutto was unbelievable and the chorizo was fantastic. The asparagus with morel mushrooms is delish. My honey ordered the steak that was served with a massive morel stuffed with foie gras on a bed of mashed potato. My pork chop was WAY too big for me but the flavor was delish. My honey also enjoyed the lemon meringue tart (he mentioned it was unusual with a flaky/crunchy base).   We watched some incredible meals being delivered. The duck in a can sounded weird to me but so many people ordered it and were raving about how delicious it was.   The owner was actively walking around, greeting guests, chatting to staff and made us feel welcome.   When you make your reservation, specifically ask for a table, we were initially seated at the bar (which I normally love) however my honey kept getting knocked by the staff and guests. We requested a move to a table and the hostess very reluctantly agreed and was quite snooty about it so that was the only drawback of this fabulous spot."}
{"text":"Why doesn't this exist in NYC?  Someone please stuff half a duck into a can filled with duck fat and simmer it for 27 minutes... pretty please?  We came here for a birthday dinner and wound up having a birthday adventure. As with all of my five-star rated restaurants, this place blew me away with the food and atmosphere.  Although there are aspects that I can nit-pick (e.g. unmarked bathrooms and some absent-minded waiters at times), I must tip my hat to the exquisite and delicious meals.  Here's what to order: * Foie Gras Cromesquis - this is Foie Gras melted inside a fried ball of awesome.  It's like hot sex in your mouth in a very good way (not that there's a bad way).  * Tarragon Bison Tongue - some people may say \"ewwww tongue\", but you will not be disappointed if you order this. The meat just melts in your mouth and the tongue flavor is lightly masked by a delicate sauce.  I could have probably had 3 of these and that would have been good enough as a meal for me.  * Duck in a Can - I thought this was just for the novelty of having a duck in a can being opened and poured onto your plate, but no... it's much more than that. It's everything delicious and unhealthy that you'd gladlly die for multiple times.  The amount of oil and fat in this is ridiculous - you can see it giving you a heart attack before you even take the first bite, but alas, you will bite into heaven and close your eyes in pleasure.  Included in your half duck is foie gras - the whole chunk of it.  Everything about this was amazing - including the bread dipping and stomach holding afterwards. There's too much rich, dense amazingness in this meal to be kept all to yourself, so please share.  Everything about the meal was fantastic. I ate here on Saturday night and I'm still full. In fact, this may be the straw that broke the back of my metabolism. it's probably all downhill from here..."}
{"text":"SUMMARY:  This place is a definite 4. The chefs are skillful and the flavours are rich.    Knowing that I might never visit this restaurant again, my companion and I ordered everything that piqued our interest based on numerous Yelp reviews, i.e., Foie Gras Poutine, Crispy Salad, Bison Tongue, Duck in a Can and Pied Du Cochon.  That's a lot of food for only 2 people - but we paced ourselves and packed up part of our appetizers.  As we were waiting for our mains, we glimpsed some bone marrow in the open kitchen and discovered it was not listed on the menu.  My companion just had to try it, so we ordered it and it turned out to be a real highlight of the evening!  There were some delicious mushrooms on top of the marrow, and I believe there was some sake in the marrow.  I hate to say it, but the appetizers were the best part of the meal.  The Duck in a Can, though an interesting novelty, was rather salty and the meat seemed overly cured.  Also, after eating Foie Gras with the poutine as well as eating the bone marrow, our stomachs were probably significantly dulled by the amount of fat we'd already ingested.  The Pied Du Cochon had an interesting flavour, the meat was tender, the cabbage(?) was smoky and slightly sweet and sour.  The skin really melted in my mouth, but by then I didn't want food that melted in my mouth.    The saving grace was the virgin mojito with fresh mint and raspberries that tempered the flavours of the meal.    We left with a significant amount of leftovers (I think we only took 5 bites of the Pied Du Cochon, which was huge)...and then gave it to a homeless person who seemed very appreciative to receive our leftovers (though he probably had no idea how much the meal inside the bag was worth!).  I think Foie Gras Poutine already has mythic status in foodie circles, hence, this visit was worth it for the experience.   If I were to go there again (maybe after a few years of burning off these calories), I would probably stick with ordering a few appetizers with a mojito.  There's only so much fat one can eat in one sitting..."}
{"text":"How do I even start to describe what was one of the best meals and dining experiences of my life? Two words- foie gras! Our hotel made bar seat reservations for us. Many people would be annoyed by this, but for two very enthusiastic home cooks, these were the best seats in the house. We had so much fun watching the action in the open kitchen. They should charge extra for these seats! The meal- incredible! We started with the foie gras cromesquis which were so delicious and fun to eat. They just melted in your mouth. We also had a seared foie gras and some type of cheese dish with a mushroom and corn sauce. Hard to describe, but so good, layered, and rich. For entrees we had the duck in a can, which is a marvel and really delicious. I had the  veal with mushrooms and fava beans in a conaque sauce topped with foie gras. Amazing! For dessert we elected to share the lemon meringue pie which was good but certainly not the star of the show. Apparently that honor goes to the baked alaska, which we were just too full to tackle. Next time. The chef engaged us in conversation a couple of times to answer questions about the dishes. And, then finished the meal by doing Jager shots with us.  Fantastic place. If you like foie gras or a real culinary adventure, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"I can truly say that the roasted squash (mini pumpkin) stuffed with frois gras and mushroom sauce/gravy was out of this world. One of the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. It was seasonal so not part of the regular menu and I regret not taking a picture of it.  The server mentioned that the chef came up with the idea couple of days ago since they freshly harvest squashes from their farm.  It was a big serving for an appetizer. We also had pork chops and the duck.  Phenomenal!!  If anything I would pass on the dessert next time. Order the chocolate molten cake and it was ok.  We were so stuffed at that point so wasn't that enjoyable."}
{"text":"Best food we had in Montreal ! Not a fancy place, totally crowded (get a reservation), yummy food, reasonable wine list.  You better not be a vegetarian/vegan ;)"}
{"text":"Best food in Montreal, great service!!! Thumbs up for that women run kitchen!!!  good job girls!"}
{"text":"I've been to the apple harvest season the last two years and both previous  years were exceptional and absolutely blew me away. I don't know what happened this year but I found the first entree, a a salad overly drenched in a salty fishy caesar house dressing on regular lettuce (if it was romaine it was the poorest variety is ever seen throw in some big ass croutons with chunks of what I'm guessing to be smoke cured ham, couldn't really tell because of the over powering flavour of fried smelt and salt.... And every dish there after felt as if I was a contestant on fear factor... Yeah, there was a couple decent cream sauces here and there but nothing compared to the years before. It felt like there was no continuum to the plates being served. Just a repetition of pick the bones out of your fish and let's throw some food gras on top to make it fancy.... I won't waste my time or gas or sleep going back.g"}
{"text":"Our final night in Montreal was spent at APDC. All in all it was an excellent experience. It is located on a street with a bunch of restaurants- beware, it does not have a sign which adds to the charm.   We started with the onion soup for me and a scallop special for him. I loved the baked cheese, I mean soup. It really was tasty. My husband liked the scallop, but he didn't love it. He wasn't raving like he sometimes does. And I think he was wanting another scallop. One is tiny.   I had the duck carpaccio and poutine for a main. The duck was fabulous!  The raw egg added an extra level of complexity and flavor. The poutine was good, not knock your socks off great. He had the duck in a can which was everything he thought it would be. He loved it.   We considered dessert, but didn't do it. I kinda wanted the sugar pie, but they were out. We are better for it so no complaints.   The atmosphere is fun, the service ok and the food excellent. Go if you can."}
{"text":"found this place because of the high number of yelp reviews and decided that it must be a place worth checking out while our visit to montreal.  we started off with the bison tongue and codfish fritters. the bison tongue tasted like tongue, yes, but it was quite delicious. the crunchiness of the carrots and the pickles really went well together with the tongue. the fritters were good but a bit chewy.  for our entree, we ordered the famous duck in a can and plogue a champlain. the duck really was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. the fois gras on the other hand was too sweet - there was too much glaze sauce that it overpowered the dish.  other than that, the service was great - helpful and attentive. the ambiance is laid back and cozy - loud and bustling inside. i expected more for the price. the duck in a can however, is worth trying while you are in montreal."}
{"text":"I'm so conflicted about PDC.  Was it good?  Yes.  Was it mind-blowingly amazing; a lavishly decadent meal guaranteed to make your own liver into foie gras from overconsumption of luscious aforementioned product (from a duck and hopefully not a human)?  Ehhh.   Maybe it's because I had super hyped it up on my own head.  Having learned of PDC ~10 years ago, it took awhile before I had the chance to visit Montreal again.  It also takes awhile to get reservations: I once found out that 1 month in advance wasn't nearly enough notice for reservations.  This time, I called 4 months ahead to nab the spot.   The best thing about PDC for me was the service. Super friendly and helpful with recommendations.  I was planning to go on a foie gras bender, but the waitstaff gently recommended that I not make myself sick and hate foie forever.  With his advice, here's what ordered for the night:  - Foie gras cromesquis: tiny squares of breaded & fried foie gras, popped in one bite so the molten liquid foie spreads across your tongue in all its delicious glory.  Think sugar cube, made of foie.  - Naked foie gras: Two generous slabs of foie that's been seared and covered with what I recall as balsamic reduction.  It was good, but I just thought there would be less \"stuff\" on it, y'know?  - Savoury clams on the half shell: Raw pasta clams - I didn't even know you can eat these raw!  Less toothsome than the usual cherrystone variety and of course, much smaller given the nature of the savoury clam. The hubs found them fishy.  - Duck carpaccio: A thin sheet of raw duck covers the plate and is then dotted with accoutrement like egg yolk.  Am sorry to say that I can't recollect much else of the dish at the moment, but I remember having liked it while the hubs found it \"weird and gamey\".  - Duck in a can: Basically duck cooked sous-vide.  Impressive showmanship when the can is opened at the table and poured into the dish on front if you.  The duck itself is okay, but I wish the skin were crispy...also, this may sound ridiculous and bum-holey, but I thought it tasted very single-noted (like plain old duck).  There was a slab of foie gras encased in the can too, but somehow the duck itself lacked depth of flavour to me...yes, yes, warned you I'm going to sound like a bum hole! - Braised beef: Promptly and voraciously devoured by the hubs, who echoed through the next week or so that it was the best plate of the night.  This was off the daily specials menu.  - Maple pudding Chomeur: Super sweet bread-type pudding - Crepes Suzette: Very liquored up, but set alight at the table to burn off the alcohol so only the taste remains  As far as restaurants go, I really did enjoy this place.  The conflict for me is likely more internal - I thought that PDC would have the best foie gras in the world.  And while it was certainly readily available, it just wasn't the *~OMG BEST!~*  I'd say keep your expectations in check then go to PDC and enjoy."}
{"text":"Book your reservation now.   For the price, this place cannot be beat.   A restaurant that serves foie gras in over half it's menu? Hell yes. I knew very little about the restaurant before coming but was to follow truly blew me out of the water.   I came with 3 friends and here is the breakdown of our meal:   Foie Gras Cromesquis - As my friend described it, \"meat gushers\". The crunchy outer layer gave way to a liquid burst of duck fat and liver.   Foie gras poutine - In my opinion, the must have of the night. I had tried poutine in other places, but the duck based gravy was truly amazing. I smothered the bread we had in it. And the seared foie gras on top was icing on the cake.   Bison Tongue - Lightly seared then sliced n covered in a cream and brown sauce. The texture was soft and chewy. A nice light appetizer dish.   PDC Melting Pot - This was probably the least impressive, although the flavoring was amazing and I loved the mashed potatoes, it was relatively simple compared to the others. If you're a fan of sausage I'd recommend this one. It also comes with blood sausage which was a little too dense for me but unique nonetheless.  Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras - The main event. This thing is huge! (TWSS) They cut up and season the pork meat, stuff it back into the skin and pin it back up. Top that with seared Foie Gras and put it in a bed of mashed potatoes.  The meat was super tender and the skin was lightly breaded for a crisp texture. This dish is gluttony at its best, but amazingly, the flavor is still light enough to keep wanting more.  Venison and bison tartare - Wow. The tart and slightly sweet marinade they used complimented the gaminess so well that even my friend who isn't into gamy meats liked this dish. By this time we were super full but it was light enough to try a few bites.   Sugar Pie for 2 - Actually, this was good for 4 of us. It came a la mode. The pie crust was delicate and crisp and the sweet filling was balanced by the vanilla ice cream. A great cherry on top of an amazing meal.   Being tourists, we over ordered but our waitress let us know that we probably couldn't finish everything so we dropped one dish. Good thing she did because we could barely stomach another bite after this feast. We had enough for leftovers the next morning which surprisingly tasted good even without microwaving.   As for the ambiance, it's very laid back and the waiters are all very attentive and great at their jobs.   If I had another chance, I'd definitely come back! One of the best meals of my lifetime"}
{"text":"Prepare yourself for a well earned meat coma. Don't drive here - they have an excellent wine selection (plus, meat coma).   If you leave without trying the foie gras cromesquis you've missed something extraordinary.  Reservations must be made in advance, and anyone that does not indulge in pork won't appreciate how wonderful this restaurant is.  If you're going solo, there are bar seats by the kitchen that let you watch the action, and staff are always friendly - but don't sit at these seats on a date (watching the kitchen is brilliantly distracting)."}
{"text":"This was my first stop when I visited Montreal for the first time 3 weeks. We showed up at 9 on a Thursday night with no reservations and waited about 10 minutes for a table. Our server was very friendly and spoke English which helped since we do not speak French :) we had the duck carpaccio as an appetizer, so delicious! Followed by porkchops and the poutine foe gras. The foe gras was really fatty but very tasty! So glad were able to stop at this location. Btw, there's no sign. What a wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Loved the foie, loved the duck! They absolutely know how to cook their local products and everything included the bread were DELICIOUS! I would give 5 stars but I think the service was not as expected.  We noticed that all the rest of tables had bags with the leftovers packed, then we thought that meal was so delicious that people ordered extra dishes to go. But the actual situation was that there are meat dishes which were HUGE even for a family of 4. The waitress do not warn the client about the portions. There was a table beside us with a vety surprised girl after having been served. So that, we ordered an appetizer, a dish of foie and a dish of duck with mushrooms to share. We noticed that waitress didn't inform us about the portions and she was above all, pushing us to order more..."}
{"text":"Had to get duck in a can, it's unique and original and I don't know of a place in my own country where I can get it.  Bottom line, this place is a carnivore's paradise and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Just went last week.  I was with a group of 8.  The hostesses are the cutest.  they moved the tables reservations around and called us to let us know what available times there had for us.   I seriously love this place.  the room is so nice, unpretentious, warm feeling,..  And the Food was so much more than i expected.    We shared Le plateau du Plateau.  It was so amazing (pictures to come).  The shellfish was so fresh - oysters, and clams were great.  They also added a bowl of spicy snails.  I have never had these type of snails (sand snails) other than vietnamese style which is steamed and gingery.  the spicy sauce was great.    As a main dish, I shared the PDC farcie de foie gras.  It was good, but i don't think it was the best thing i could have had on the menu.  :)  because it was farcie, the meat was a tad dry - i think my friend's regular PDC was better.    Anyway, the canard en conserve is classic, the poutine foie gras is a great sharing dish, and les fleurs de courgette tempura were nice as entree.    Nice surprise, at the end of the evening, my friend who could not finish her cote de porc took it to go.  They took it to the back and brought it back in airtight plastic (kinda like the sous-vide bag).  haha   OHHH and dessert!!!  I love the pudding chomeur!  it comes piping hot, covered in maple syrup.  Takes you back to your Cabane a Sucre memories!  Get a coffee and its heaven.    Dinner went from 9 to 12:30 and there were still people in the restaurant.  no rush.  love it."}
{"text":"As good as it gets! --  Probably one of my top favorite meal I've had so far in Quebec . We booked this place 3 months in advance because of how popular this place is and it was worth the wait. The place is not too small & not too big. There's no sign that says you're at APC, so I'd use google maps if you're not a local.   We tried several dishes amongst the 7 of us and all of them met or went beyond our expectations. The foie gras pizza & foie gras poutine was a delicious appetizer that got our juices flowing for the entree. The fatty liver literally melts in your mouth. For the entree we shared a Tuna Steak Calamari & Fresh parmesan gnocchi. The gnocchi was prepared in a huge block of fresh parmesan cheese with pesto sauce. Definitely, snapchat/IG worthy.   We wanted to try the pig's head but unfortunately they were sold out of it for the day. Other than that, service was phenomenal. Everyone was very attentive and helpful. I also must mention the bathroom, which was also phenomenal since they went all out with purchasing a bidet! A nice little treat for your tushy.   I would definitely recommend this spot if you're visiting Montreal, but be sure to book this place in advance!"}
{"text":"Dear Yelp, I propose a special 6th star that I can award to establishments like Au Pied De Cochon.  In a world full of mediocrity, PDC shines above all in Montreal....can I please have that 6th star now??  Here's the thing: this is a place you have to experience to appreciate. My verbal abilities can't really do the food, service, and atmosphere justice. But what I can say is this: this is the kind of rare place you wish time would stop during your meal and you can keep hitting rewind over and over again before you get the check, a restaurant that feeds all senses, not just one (or two).   The food I have enjoyed there reminds me of all the wasted valuable time and money eating everywhere else, ever.  So, do yourself a favor and try to make it to PDC, at least once!   Don't bother looking for a sign outside with the restaurant's name, there aint one."}
{"text":"Share everything, and order as many dish as you can!  Everything is fantastic, but you can't be scared to eat anything.  I would have loved to try even more from the menu, but we went there three girls at 9:30PM, so my hunger was there, but not for long.  Service is superb and personalized.  We let the staff decide what we were going to eat, and what to drink even.  That was not disappointing. If you get there and you don't know what to get, go ahead and tell them to prepare a menu for you.  In this menu, we had the Duck Carpaccio, which was simply fabulous. Melt in your mouth, exactly what a carpaccio should be.  We also had the Beet and Goat Cheese Salad, as one of ours doesn't eat that much game and \"weird\" food.  A beet and goat cheese salad is so yesterday for me, but this was so well presented, as a little tower, and the flavors were just melted together, and it was probably the best beet salad I have ever had.  We had another salad after that, the squab giblets salad, which was also very flavorful and very precise in terms of taste and temperature.  As for our main, The Canard en Conserve, which is a duck leg confite served in a can, that they open at your table and dump on your plate.  The smell was so fantastic.  The slow cooked cabbage in the dish reminded me of my childhood.  A nice piece of foie gras was inserted under the skin, all for a fabulous mix of unforgettable savoriness.  They have a nice wine list too, and the markup isn't exagerrated.  Quite fantastic!"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would. This place was the best dining experience I have had in a very long time!  We are visiting from California. I was dying for foie gras because we don't have it anymore in California. We asked our concierge for a reservation. He called said all they had was 9:30pm. A little late for dinner but I was excited just to go. Every restaurant on the street was slow except this one. Completely packed with people. We go in and all they have is a spot at the bar. My boyfriend and I didn't mind and followed the hostess down the hallway dodging the servers who are running back and forth. This place is chaotic and loud in the best sort of way. Our bartender/server was named Jerrome. He was the best bartender I have ever met. He was exciting and fun. He made our Experience incredible. He was knowledgable and entertaining. He was from France and such a happy guy. You could tell he found so much joy in his job.   We ordered the poutine fries with foie gras. I don't think you should come here and not have them. They are incredible. Then we had the melting pot which has different kinds of porks. It also come with mashed potatoes. Lastly we had duck in can. Omg that was the best thing we have ever had. I was a little scared when it actually came in a can and they opened it right in front of us. They literally dump all the goodness on top of a toasted bread and cauliflower purÃ©e. This also comes with foie so you can't lose.   The wine by the glass is a little pricy. We ordered the Pinot Noir which was $17 per glass. It was worth the price because it was smooth and wonderful!   I don't think we stopped smiling once. I highly recommend siting at the bar. If your someone who is looking for a normal fine dining experience I wouldn't come here. This isn't a white table cloth stuffy kinda place. This is a place to enjoy amazing rich food and have an experience like no other. I will miss Montreal for this place alone."}
{"text":"So a week before I headed to Montreal, I came upon an episode of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservation in Quebec. Yes, he went to this restaurant and had almost everything on the menu. Because of the episode, I took it as an omen and put it down as a must try. After all, I admire Bourdain's sense of adventure and trust his palate that has taken him all over the world so the fact that he got really stuffed here, it must be good. And I (or he?) was right.  This restaurant, in my opinion, does not serve your fancy gourmet. It is a bit of french country with a whole lot of boldness in using unusual ingredients. I loved my chicken hearts salad with the perrrrrfectly soft boiled eggs. The pickled bison tongue had a well-balanced acid bite that savors your appetite and wanting for more. The entrees were decadent. My boyfriend had an amazing lamb shank and he couldn't resist the fries in duck fat. As for me, I took the duck in a can. Foie gras, duck fat and breast, balsamic and red wine reduction, and thyme all cook in a can. When served, the waiter comes with a can opener and then pour it on top of a nicely toasted butter brioche. It's a lot of yummy gooey duck fat in a can and I can attest that it taste even better the next day.   Service is great and they are people that knows and proud of their food. They also have a great wine and beer list. It is a very good restaurant and I love that they don't serve your typical food. If you're looking for a culinary experience and adventurous eating, this is one of the best concepts out there. Don't trust me? Just ask the hundreds of people that are eating there until midnight on a weekday.  PS don't forget to check out the bathrooms. It has a TV and a gigantic sink. I could've stayed in there and just hang out..."}
{"text":"We dined here on 6/22 during our recent vacation in Montreal. Overall we had a wonderful experience that I'll never forget. The food was superb with artful presentations served in a warm, inviting and modern atmosphere. The stars of this menu are the Foie Gras & Pork dishes but everything we tried was atleast excellent with some plates reaching perfection.  The food:  Starters -   Fresh Warm Bread & Butter- A great start to our meal. The bread was thickly sliced with a crispy crust and soft interior. This ame with cold butter.  Beef Tartare - I loved this dish. The presentation was perfect as it was served in 2 Sushi-style \"Temaki\" nori hand rolls with crispy onion shoe strings, warm rice, lucious beef tartare topped with a quail egg in it's shell with sesame seeds on top. You poured the quail egg and sesame seed mix on top. I couldn't get over the marriage of flavors. It was devine.  Entrees:  Duck In A Can - Medium rare Duck, Foie Gras, Thyme & Balsamic Jus served over Mashed Potatoes & Toast. The presentation was whimsical as our server used a can opener tableside and spun the contents of the cooked can over a plate of Mashed potatoes over toast. The flavors were nearly perfect. I loved everything about this plate with the only exception being that the duck skin was a little rubbery and gelatinous instead of crispy. Otherwise it was sublime.  Pork Chop with Red Cabbage & Onions - My wife ordered this and it didn;t disappoint. This dish was simple in presentation but big on flavor. I loved the balnce of red cabbage and onions with the moist chop. It really elevated thedistinct and smoky flavor of the pork.  Side:  Frites cooked in Duck Fat - These were without a doubt the best fries I've ever had. Simply amazing. Served in a paper cone with a side of mayonnaise. The fries were crisp on the outside and hot and soft in the center. We skipped the mayonnaise and dipped them in the jus from our entrees. These paired with the Duck In A Can beautifully.  Dessert:  Dark Chocolate Pot de Creme - I love dark chocolate and I love dessert. This was a warm chocolate pudding topped with whipped creme and buttery cake crumbs served in a jar. It was rich and decadent.  Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - We paired this with out Pot de Creme and it provided the perfect balance of flavor and temperature. It was the perfect end to our meal @ APDC.  Overall we had a wonderful time @ APDC. It was without a doubt the most relaxing, fun and enjoyable fine dining experience I've ever had. This is not light fare but certainly delicous, thoughtful and stellar food presented in a casual environment. Count me in as a now devoted fan of chef Martin Picard. Merci Beaucoup Chef."}
{"text":"Foie Gras overload. Wow. Crazy decadent rich meal.   This place was packed with a line out the door. It has a nice vibe (definitely not \"fine dining\" but more hip gastropub) and the waitstaff were really nice and took time to give us specials, answer questions about the menu, and give us reccs.   The food was pretty good but definitely a little on the rich side. We had the foie poutine (delicious) as well as the buckwheat pancake with bacon/foie/maple syrup appetizer which was also delicious. Folks at my table went with the special tuna which was pretty good. I went with the duck in a can. I dunno if I was foie'd out at that point but it was a bit too rich and not quite as tender as I thought it would be. That being said, the flavor was good and the presentation fun.   All in all, a good experience but I'd probably try out a lot more restaurants in Montreal before coming back. Also, while I don't think it is necessarily overpriced (good portion sizes and high quality ingredients in unique food) it also isn't cheap or one of those places you come out thinking \"wow, that was such a good value.\"   So yeah, overall, probably closer to 3.5 than 4 stars for me. That being said, I'm looking forward to eating my leftover Foie once I recover..."}
{"text":"I came here a second time and still couldn't get a reservation.  I ended up eating my EXTREMELY DELICIOUS FOIE GRAS POUTINE on the curb.    Top three best meal of my life!   The Duck gravy is perfect! Savory, flavorful and a good consistency.  Big lobs of foie gras nestled on top.  It was so beautiful, I teared up momentarily before devouring. Don't even think about the $37 price tag. Just order it and enjoy a full body foodgasm."}
{"text":"This dinner was incredible. Eat very little before you go to dine here!! We booked a reservation 3 weeks in advance, we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated but we didn't mind. We sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen which was an experience in itself. Watching the chefs work their magic, making sauce and cooking meat was pretty cool. We ordered Foie Gras Poutine to start....I have never seen a bigger piece of foie gras in my life! It was so good! My friend ordered the Duck Magret in Mushroom Sauce with a side of garlic broccoli and I got the Happy Pork Chop with a side of fries (in duck fat). Both dishes were fantastic and HUGE! We could not finish them and were so sad to leave such delicious meals behind.  The staff was helpful and very pleasant. Next time we go we'll try the Duck in a Can and the desserts!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE 5/5 - Perfect and lively. We came at 8pm w/reservations and it was crowded! I think I made the reservation 3 weeks in advance on their website.  SERVICE 5/5 - Our server was lively and helpful but my one critique was that he talked incredibly fast so we had a difficult time understanding the dish ingredients in combination to the noise in the restaurant.   APPETIZER 5/5 - Tartare Temaki: I was really hesitant about this dish but because of my dairy sensitivity, it was the only appetizer that I could consume. Anyway, this was amazing. It was tender, tasty and it had a QUAIL EGG you pour into the temaki.   MAIN 5/5 - Duck in a can (onions, cabbage, bacon, thyme, garlic cooked in butter and 100 g of foie gras). This was a memorable dish!!! It was so decadent and pairs perfectly with a glass of red wine. You'll never forget this dish and it's a must try in Montreal.  MAIN 5/5 - Pork Chop: wow this was delicious. The sauce was incredible and the pork chop was cooked to perfection! If I come back to this restaurant, I would definitely reorder the pork chop. It gets overshadowed by the novelty of the Duck in a Can and the Stuffed Pied de Cochon w/foie gras.   DESSERT 5/5 - Pecan Pie: again, I cannot eat dairy so this was the only dessert I was able to order but let me tell you that this was the BEST pecan pie my partner and I have ever tasted!! Inside was gooey caramel topped with perfectly toasted pecans. The crust = A++++  BATHROOM 5/5 - I know.. weird I am commenting on the bathroom after dessert but the toilet seat was heated and bathroom was clean. There's a TV in front of the toilet that shows what's going on in the kitchen (I think).   I need to come back to Montreal to have another memorable meal at Au Pied de Cochon!"}
{"text":"Une grande institution de la cuisine quÃ©bÃ©coise gourmande.  Un menu exquis et une belle carte des vins. PrÃ©parer son foie Ã  toute une expÃ©rience culinaire."}
{"text":"Warning!! MOUTH ORGASM!!! I'm posting this while im still at the restaurant. That's how damn good this meal was.. the duck in the can was insane. By far the best meal my girlfriend and I had our whole trip. Foi gras on the bread that comes with the duck is mouth watering delicious.. you can imagine how good it is since im posting while still here.. Don't shy away from this place if you're in montreal."}
{"text":"What an experience! I had to make a reservation a whole month in advance in order to get a dinner reservation at a reasonable time on a Friday, and even so was only promised bar seats. When we got to the restaurant, a fortunate turn of events meant that we got to sit at a table.  Service seemed really rushed and hectic, but the food was entirely worth the three times our server walked us by without taking our orders. I tried the starter of apple foie gras, and the mains of duck and mushrooms and a bowl of potatoes and cured meats. The apple foie gras was beyond delicious.  I would highly recommend making Au Pied de Cochon a pit stop if you are visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Professional service, excellent dishes, fiddleheads, clever foie nigiri with peanut sauce, calamari pasta! Must go to!"}
{"text":"A Pescetarian walks into Au Pied de Cochon.  Loved it. Amazing service, despite how packed and booked this place was. They found 2 tables for us outside and our waiter was the best. He was cute, knew his beer, and made great suggestions and convo.  My Blue Cheese, Apple & Endive Salad was worth every 10 of my $10. Its large, so much flavor, and pretty! The Foie Gras Cromesquis i could live without, not my cup of tea--i tried it well because...when in rome.. i mean when in montreal. My friend loved her poutine fries, deff worth every penny of hers. Also, they have a great stout collection here, over all we were pleased."}
{"text":"It is hard to come to Au Pied de Cochon if you don't like foie gras (goose liver) because literally 80% of the dishes have foie gras in some capacity. If you are visiting MontrÃ©al and want to check two items off your Canada bucket list in one go, get the Foie Gras Poutine. It will be a stark difference from the poutines you may have had before and will have after that day due to the sheer perfection of the ingredients and the best gravy you will ever have.   They have some daily specials, each one of which could compete to get on the daily menu easily. The cannelloni entrÃ©e was absolutely perfect. So much was going on in that dish that bewildered my palate and, like everything else on the menu, so heavy it was that it was hard to finish on my own. The sweetness of the sauce meshed absolutely perfect with the saltiness of the pork and duck.  Finally, the dessert. Despite what its name suggests, the Maple Poudding ChÃ´meur is no poor man's pudding. This amazing dessert is heavy and sugary and just so bad for you, yet you want to eat it anyway. The cake is shaped like an island and is covered by a sea of maple butter. The sugariness of the gooey maple will make the blood rush to your head, yet every bite will keep you interested.   The service was superb. It is not everyday I go to fancy restaurants like this and I neither looked like the wealthiest nor the classiest customer, but the waiting staff made me feel welcome and took an absolute care in handling all my plates. Our bilingual waitress explained each dish to us carefully and offered her helpful advice in picking the dishes, which we heeded.   This restaurant has been a bucket list item for me for over 2 years and I am glad to have finally checked it off my list. You should too."}
{"text":"WOW.  That's my initial reaction to the PDC Cabane.  It's quite the overwhelming experience, that's for sure.  I won't get into details about the individual dishes, because others have already done so quite well here, but I will highlight the fact that you will eat things you never thought of eating before, and things you have eaten before, but in combinations you never thought of eating together.  Food wise, it's an adventure!  And every bit is special.    What is also an experience is the atmosphere.  While it isn't your typical sugar shack, it definitely has that \"party in the countryside\" vibe going on.  I'm not sure if it was because we were at the last seating of the day at 8pm, but there was definitely a party vibe going on.  The music being played definitely contributed (Radio Radio, Malajube, amongst others), and you could tell people were genuinely excited to be there.  Seating is at HUGE tables.  We were a group of five, and we were seated at a big table with a group of three and a couple.  It made sharing the dishes interesting, as often the platters were just too huge to pass around, so it became teamwork to make sure everyone got to try everything.  And even if we could have passed the dishes around, the table was constantly covered in dishes.  This was fun as it contributed to the big family party vibe going on, but a teensy bit of a downside if you're the kind of person who likes to admire presentation from up close.  Word of warning regarding drinks: if you order a beer or a cider, the pints are the not the pints you are used to.  They are HUGE!   Which can be a very good thing . . . or a bad thing if you're the designated driver of your group (because remember, windy country roads in the dark to get back to the main road, STAY SAFE!).  The staff there is awesome.  They come around and explain each dish, bring water, drinks, etc.  Everyone we interacted with was super pleasant, and you could tell they were having a good time.  Even more awesome is that Martin Picard himself came around the room welcoming everyone, and then afterwards hung out at the bar chatting.  You could tell he loves his cabane.    Finally, a super nice touch is being able to see into the kitchen from the front deck.  When we first arrived the previous seating wasn't quite finished yet, so we hung about and it was so neat to see the kitchen activities.  I love how no nonsense everything is at the cabane.  Someone from our group went out for a smoke partway through the meal, and he got to see hams being unloaded from the smoker.  If you want a fancy meal you get to pick, stare at, and then devour at your own pace, go to the restaurant.  If you want a meal that is beyond your wildest dreams, in a festive atmosphere, go to the cabane.  One has definitely given me a new appreciation for the other, and vice versa."}
{"text":"Few things in life are special in their own way and are precious without a price tag. They not only leave a long lasting impression but ultimately they change who you are as a person and define what you become:  - perhaps your very first memory ever, maybe with your parents in your childhood home  -Your first kiss, the anxiety leading up to it  - am I going to do it right ? Will they laugh at me ? And the overwhelming happiness after.  - First time you fall in love and feel on top of the world  This is how I felt when I had dinner here - I ordered a baked squash stuffed with cheese and this is a first time I had squash that tasted this orgasmically perfect. I couldn't have asked for anything better that night - a warm cozy inviting ambiance that blanketed you like a warm smooshey blanket, a perfect bottle of wine, company of dear friends and THAT SQUASH. That squash was the most amazing squash I have ever had ! I eat it all, including the skin and I barely let my husband eat the tiniest piece.   The rest of the evening was a blur, I think one of my friends ordered a \"duck in a can?\"  But all I remembered was this butternut squash.   I have since come home from this trip ( this was in September of 2015) and been cooking squash non-stop ever since. It's been over a year and a half and I still remember the taste of this perfectly cooked squash in my mouth !  When a restaurant has this much power, you know it will be worth your visit. I been back to the city many times, but too scared to come back and ruin that perfect memory. Perhaps on my next visit, I'll take a leap of faith.   This is a must to visit, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I had always heard Au Pied was one of the best restaurants in the city, but had never gotten around to going. This spring I brought a buddy and his visiting bachelor party  and we were all blown away. Highlights include: George St. Pierre sighting, pork grinds starter, pork chop the size of my head, pulled pork french toast sandwich, and a frois grois poutine that brought down the house. Go there."}
{"text":"Foie gras time! This place is always busy so be sure to call in for a reservation. I sat at the bar and it was pretty nice chatting to the bartenders and waiters. They have reccomendations and extensive wine list. I order a glass of red wine, fried foie gras, PDC salad (pig, duck, chicken hearts) and foie gras poutine. The fried foie gras was mouth-watering. The waiter tells me to wait 45 seconds before placing it inside my mouth and chew with your mouth closed as the foie gras gush out leaving your mouth super satisfied. The PDC salad was huge and generous amounts of PDC for sure. Lastly, what I've been waiting for, foie gras poutine! It was love at first bite and every bite after. The seared foie gras was impeccable and simply melts inside your mouth. The cheese curd was chewy and had much flavor. The gravy complimented everything there and it was simply divine. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"waited one hour between dishes. poor service! asked for a cake for my husbands borthday, they completely forgot about it."}
{"text":"APDC is great. loud but the food is unique and excellent. the menu is very meat intensive. even salads have organ meat in them. after dining here over a dozen times, i've come to realize that they have the one of the best (regular) poutines in town. it sounds plain relative to the rest of their menu but get it - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Here is the tale. My wife and I were visiting Montreal for an extended weekend and popped in to Au pied de cochon in hopes that they'd be able to take us in for dinner. In spite of not having a reservation (which I recommend you get) they had a table for us. Blammo! Positive point number one: No reservation but got a table during the dinner rush.  The food was phenom.  We just decided to try appetizers, and were happy with that. The tomato tartlet is a winner.  The cochonnailles platter was a great choice too, although there was one meat (maybe bison) that nearly made my wife puke.  We also ordered the poutine.  It was good, but had a good laugh when they brought it out and I realized that it was a 14lb plate of fries, cheese and gravy. I've tried poutine in the U.S. but got a schoolin' about what real poutine is.  Very tasty, and if you've never tried it, I suggest giving it a shot.  The tables are close together, so be prepared to rub elbows with your neighbors.  If you're not shy and don't mind projecting your conversation to the other patrons, you'll fit right in.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Our waitress was on the spot with refills.  We did notice at the end of the meal that it took a long time to get our bill, but not sure if that was our fault for not signaling that we were finished. No big deal, we weren't in a hurry.  Overall, it was very good and I had a great time.  I'd give it five stars if we'd not had to wait 20 minutes for our bill after we finished, and if some of the items on the platter weren't a little suspicious, but overall this is a great stop if you're in the mood for a nice meal with friends."}

{"text":"Love the vibe, be ready for a heart attack.  The food is ridiculously rich. Everything is piled with foie gras if they can. Loved the energy and vibe of the place and the beautiful crowd.  Interesting experience but I probably wouldn't return. Perhaps more to protect my poor heart for having to breathe through all the clogged arteries."}
{"text":"Can you really go wrong with foie? This place didn't. The creativity, the flavor profiles, all excellent. Our waiter was also very patient when we asked him a million questions.   The only bad thing was that since we got a late reservation, half the menu was out of stock. Next time though...  We got the foie cromesquis, which was a small deep fried foie with liquid inside. It literally was an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth. You tasted the foie, which was surprising given that it was deep fried. The temaki was delicious- no foie (and also it was beef, not bison since they were out). It was just beef tartar in a sushi handroll with quail egg and some spice but I loved it (not surprising since I'm Asian). The duck carpaccio was delicious (also no foie) - I liked the egg that we had to mix in with it but thought it was too much egg. It wasn't a regular egg either and not a quail egg - it was big but idk what it was.   We had the terrine with apple jelly and yes, it tasted as good as it sounds. The salt wasn't evenly distributed so the first bite seemed bland but later on, it was amazing. And a big portion. The regular seared foie was, of course, delicious. We also had the foie on top of a fruit cake. My friends loved it. I liked the foie but I'm not a fan of fruit cake. We also had the foie and boudin tart. The pastry definitely helped to make the dish. The blood sausage was delicious but the potato in the dish seemed overly much. By that point, I was in a food coma. I couldn't even partake in the dessert.    Next time, and yes there will be a next time, I'm getting the foie burger."}
{"text":"My sister Jess has been living in Montreal for the past three years and each year I have visited and together we have the made the pilgrimage to all things pig and duck - Au Pied De Cochon. The restaurant is quite small, narrow and long, an open plan kitchen and wood fired oven line one of the walls. Due to the proximity of patrons, pots and pigs it can be pretty hot, but in a hearty open fire type of way, it is immediately endearing.  During our first visit we had what was arguably the finest dish there, not pig or duck, but lamb confit. The shank had been braised slowly in goose fat, rosemary and thyme. It was served on a bed of light puy lentils, a touch of vinegar lifting them against the rich meat. The sauce, OMG, was a heavily reduced lamb juice and tomato concoction, the depth of flavour hard to articulate, I was blushing and I am not normally shy. I was so enamoured that I spent the next two days hunting down the cook book and one year later recreated the same dish for my mothers European birthday adventure, it didn't disappoint.   During my second visit we had the duck in a can, canned duck breast, foie gras, root vegetables and once again another incredible sauce. It may be a little gimmicky, they open the can at your table and throw it on a plate, but if it is good enough for Mr Bourdain (I am secretly developing a weird man crush) it is good enough for me. We also had a foie gras tart, which was devine, the richness of the foie gras offset buy the tart apple.   So I suppose it is unfortunate that my last memory there is my least favourite. After much deliberation we decided to opt for their speciality, the pigs foot stuffed with foie gras, this is not a decision to be taken lightly, literally. If like me you have ever stared eye to eye with a pigs foot then you will probably be a little terrified by the idea, hoofs are just plain scary, I would eat a hairy tattooed biker any day. The foot comes in a crumbed batter atop a bed of mash strewn with root vegetables, drowning in a rich sauce with a few pieces of foie gras on top. It is not pretty. I found the majority of it intimidating and rather gloopy, even my sisters frenchie BF lacked the means to tackle it properly.   For the next few days the pig took residence in my body like some dark poltergeist, I had both sweats and nightmares. You are warned.  To avoid finishing on such a dark pig demon note, if in the Monte, you must go there, just heed my advice."}
{"text":"Always on my mind and to do when i journey north to MTL. Friendly and attentive people who i think really care about the food they serve and they way the serve it - this is considering how demanding the French (canadiens) and constantly busy this place is.   The food is summed up in one word \"excessive\". Heavy, strong flavours, generous portions - typifying French Canadian country cuisine. My fav picks:   Bison Tartar  Duck in a can  Foie Gras on pancake/maple syrup - Poutine is too heavy you won't be able to eat anything else  Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras  Fries (in duck fat)   It's not a five because of the cramped arrangement and never was able to fit desert in. I'd give you some comparisons with other restaurants as i usually do, but this place is unique. Les Halles, Balthazar, Pastis, etc... are not good candidates as the food at PDC is authentically Martin Picard."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by a simple internet search of \"best foie gras in Montrea.l\"  Immediately this place popped up.  Intrigued, I went to the website, found the email for reservations (because I was too afraid to call, I don't speak French!).  Juliette was so accommodating in reserving a table for us.  I called 2 weeks in advance and only the 5:30pm and 9pm were available - this to me just showed I made the right choice for Saturday night dinner in Montreal.    Upon arrival, it can be a little hard to find, there isn't really a sign.  If it wasn't pointed out to me by a nearby patron I probably would have walked right passed it.  We were greeted nicely by one of the waiters and were seated right away.  At 5:30pm (mind you, they open at 5pm)  the restaurant was already poppin'!  Workers were delivery food, the smell of delicious pork, duck, beef filled the air, I couldn't wait to order.  The (3) of us decided to share plates so we could try everything.  My only regret ( if I had any) was that I wish we got dessert...everything sounded so delicious!  Here is what we got:  French Onion Soup - we were advised to share because it was hearty.  The waiter (who was THE BEST, so entertaining, informative and just wanted us to have the best dining experience, like, ever) said that Pied de Cochon meant \"rich and heavy\" umm yes please.  He advised between the 3 of us we share one soup.  He. Was. Right.  The soup, which had all the traditional components of beef stock, onions, crouton and deliciously melted cheese had a little kick of meat which made it more filling than normal.  I would recommend this dish when you visit!  Beef Tongue with Tarragon - sounds different... I'm a big fan of beef tongue but I'll have to be honest and say that I've only really had it during hot pot or korean bbq.  The Tarragon sauce was delicious, the beef was so soft and it practically melted in your mouth.  If you're one of those \"not sure about tongue\" this dish is definitely a great way to try it for the first time!  Fg Poutine - delicious! delicious! Gravy was delicious and there were good pieces of foie gras throughout.  The fries are also fried in duck fat (yes please!)  Fg Plogue Ã  Champlain - Suggested to us by our waiter.  Imagine, a light pancake, light mashed potato, top with melted cheese and then the whole thing is topped in foie gras and drizzled with the most delicious syrup.... we were all fighting for the last piece.  Wine/Cocktailes - great selection of wine and they had 2 special cocktails that night.  We opted for a french wine and it accompanied our meal throughout.  This was our favorite restaurant when visiting Montreal.  The service was excellent, and the service team were so cohesive, they really worked together in such a tight space with a big crowd of people.  The food ,even better, I dream about fg to this day.  I highly recommend a visit when coming to Montreal just don't hesitate to make a reservation - the line was out the door and it was freezing!"}
{"text":"Sorry I'm late for this review. First, I want to say how lucky and extremely grateful I was to receive this reservation the DAY OF because there was a last minute cancellation. I have heard through word of mouth that people can wait weeks to months for a spot. The service from beginning until end was A1, accommodating and helpful when it came to the order. We loved everything from oysters, to their famous decadent \"fois gras\" and pork. This is an absolute artisanal Montreal restaurant experience. Lastly, they also have a sugar shack that my boyfriend attended for a business meeting and said \"it was hands down succulent and explosive in flavour\".  If you are a meat lover, particularly with pork and \"fatty\" textures, and enjoy the combination of sweet maple... You must must come here. Ambiance is also very classy with wood inside to imitate the look of a sugar shack."}
{"text":"I will go against the grain and say that there are way better places in Montreal (heck even on Duluth street) than Au Pied de Cochon.  Sure, they have super rich and unusual food, but the taste to value ratio just isn't there.  You are more overwhelmed by the richness of the food than the taste.  The food presentation is somewhat lacking as well for a high end establishment.  My meal was made even more difficult by not being given a knife that could actually cut my duck meat from my Duck in a Can.  As another Yelp'er mentioned that the Duck in a Can came with a giant piece of fatty skin.  My dull knife made this completely unworkable.  I'm glad I went for the experience, but I wouldn't go back (unless someone else was paying)."}
{"text":"Foie gras heaven! We were able to make reservations and luckily got seated outside on a beautiful night. I was a bit surprised by the very modest and modern ambiance of the restaurant - it was a warm evening so the entire front of the restaurant was open and I'm glad it wasn't a typical stuffy high end restaurant. Complimentary bread was brought out and though we wanted to restrict our bread intake to save our appetite, we couldn't help but eat more slices than we wanted to :) Next, came the Plogue Ã  Champlain, which was foie gras sitting on top of potatoes, cheese, bacon and some maple syrup (the perfect combination of sweet and savory). This dish was ridiculously good and unlike anything I've ever tasted especially when combined with the perfect texture of the foie gras. For main, we decided to share the infamous duck in a can along with a side of sugar shack potatoes. The duck took a very long time to come out or maybe it just felt like forever to my salivating taste buds but when the server brought out a can, I was definitely a bit disappointed that it took so long. He then of course went on to explain that the duck was canned in the afternoon and they cook it in the can. He opened the can and poured out the contents onto a plate - I felt like I was watching an art exhibition haha. Needless to say, the duck was amazing. The only semi disappointment of the meal was the potatoes - probably should have gotten the poutine instead. I can't wait to come back and try the foie gras nigiri - they are definitely innovative and creative."}
{"text":"This is almost a perfect restaurant.  I have family in Montreal and will see more of them because of this place-- I fell guilty telling them I eat here, 'cause they're strictly kosher- oops.  I was there two weeks ago and walking out I passed a pigs head on a platter with a whole lobster coming out of it's mouth!  outlandish!  I would like to try everything.. but I've thoroughly enjoyed the foie gras and maple syrup (might have been a special).  And duck in a can-- they walk up, open a can, and dump duck breast and foie gras onto a plate of toast... lovely.  Desserts- beautiful.. we had some kind of maple syrup/ice cream super hot dish-- unforgettable except I forget what it's called.  Very inventive-- very friendly, welcoming, english indulgent staff"}
{"text":"One of the best food I had so far. It exceeded  my expectations on every level. The place is nice just a little tight, the staff are very accomodating and the food is beyond fantastic. Always make a reservation just right after opening as late reservations gets seated delayed."}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon was one of the things I was MOST looking forward to on my Montreal trip!   I mean, how can your mouth not water at the sound of foie gras poutine?! The possibilities here are endless, and trust me, they have a ton of good stuff here!  We started off with a couple of drinks (some beers and a few specials each night) and ordered the following: cromesquis de foie gras, crab salad, temaki de bison, poutine au foie gras, stuffed pied de cochon, and duck in a can.  I can honestly say, each one was amazing and we overindulged. The cromesquis was the perfect bite, the crab salad was fresh and delightful, the temaki melt in your mouth tender, and the poutine au foie gras, stuffed pied de cochon, and duck in a can were all that I dreamed of and more! To be honest though, the stuffed pied de cochon and duck in a can are both heavy in taste and the flavors started to meld together after a while, but they are both still delicious. The presentation of the duck in a can was unique, and the tender pork of the pied de cochon topped with fatty melty foie gras was unbeatable. The stuffed pied de cochon is a large portion, so keep that in mind - it was a little too much food for my family!   The staff there were some of the nicest and friendliest people, which just added all the more to the experience.  5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"May be it was the wine, but with every bite, I heard angels singing \"Halleluja\" in my head.  3 dishes for 2 people  Appetizer:  special of the day.  foie gras served over a blini with a mushroom corn sauce on the side. Main course:  duck in a can, yes, you read about it.  I was amazed with how flavorful and tender the vegetables were. Chocolate pot de creme: topped with whipped cream and crumbs  Great service and good beer/wine selection"}
{"text":"In Montreal for work and was told this was the spot to visit. I made my reservation, got there early, and was seated at the bar promptly. And then I waited. And waited some more. Finally I got some water. And then some more. And then even more. Then a beer. And you get the point.   I get it, they were busy. But the one guy could've just taken my order, I already knew what I wanted. But he seemed more concerned about getting the larger tables than cater to the solo dude at the bar. It wasn't until finally, the girl helping behind the bar came over and took my order. Once she took my order, things went pretty smoothly.   The bread they give is divine. It's soft in the inside and crunchy on the outside. I don't even like bread but it went so well with their butter. This was followed by their bone marrow and caviar. The waitress made it sound like it was two little sticks. It was not. Holy meat butter goodness.   The foie burger took awhile to assemble and I could see the whole thing happening since they have an open kitchen. This place is pure controlled chaos. It's amazing how everyone knows what to do with so much going at once.   I probably lost 10 years of my life eating this burger but it did not disappoint. It's a better burger than both Minetta's and 4 Charles. I'll come to Canada just for that damn burger."}
{"text":"I would recommend going with people so you can order more.  My hungover eyes ordered more than I could eat.  Skip the APC beer because it's a lame adjunct lager. Order anything else.  The little foie croquettes are a fun experience of exploding liquid foie in your mouth. The pickled tongue I could have passed on.  The French onion soup is classic, although with chunk of pork fat inside.  The pork chop special was killer with the most wonderful and colorful tomatoes surrounding the dish.  The duck fat fries were decent, although if I came with people, I would make them foie poutine or regular poutine fries.  There was no wait for myself on a Friday night. The waiter was extremely kind. He was humble about his English, but I understood him perfectly.  A fine meal. I ordered too much and paid about $70. I think a person can reasonably spend $50-60."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner and were not disappointed. The food was beyond delicious!! Portions are perfect for sharing, plus that way you can experience every kind of flavor. Anything you get from the Foie Gras section is cooked to perfection where it just melts in your mouth(I'm drooling as I write this review FYI). We also got a lobster roll which was the best  one I've had in a while. Definitely a cool experience but even better food!!"}
{"text":"I've waited two years to try this place, ever since I've heard about the famous \"duck in a can\" from both Andrew Zimmern and Anthony Bourdain. Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  We came here during early spring, when the windows were removed, and you can enjoy the wonderful summer breeze while engorging yourself on the most wonderful of meals. Fortunately, I had placed a reservation two weeks in advance, and we were seated almost immediately by the \"very\" friendly staff. The word \"very\" is in quotation primarily because the waiter was literally standing within 5cm of our faces, but friendly, maybe it's a Canadian thing.  As for our meal, we shared the herring, beef tongue, the pate, the duck in the can, and the beef tartare. The beef tongue was absolutely marvelous, dissolving instantaneously in my tongue, leaving nothing but longing for more bites of that savory goodness. The herring was simple, but elegant, and sweet, not overwhelmed by the fishiness that comes with smaller fish. The layers of potatoes chips was a nice touch, but I thought they were fillet slices, alas. The pate was alright, don't remember much. As for the duck in a can, oh man, I think it was definitely the presentation more than anything else that sold me. The waiter came with a large can, with very amusing illustration of a duck cartoon, and poured the contents directly over a toast and pureed (unknown deliciousness). The duck was cooked with root vegetables and fois gras inside the can, and it was so tender and juicy that I would highly recommend it to everyone. Although, if the duck didn't come from a can, I may not have paid $44 for it. The beef tartare was good, but wasn't mind blowing. I did see other people ordering the pig head (which was HUGE) and the hen for 2, but I'll save that for next time. Also, if you wanted any of the pork dishes or the rib, just know that there was enough meat on that platter to keep Fred Flintstone in a food coma until the year 2000.  Overall, I was very pleased with my meal, especially paired with an excellent bottle of wine, and the best company money can never buy. I would definitely recommend coming here if you were to ever visit Montreal, and please reserve early in advance.  Food: 5 stars Ambiance 5 stars (we sat across from the brick oven and saw every dish made directly in front of us) Service: 4 stars Price: 4 stars"}
{"text":"The food at Au Pied de Cochon absolutely lives up to the considerable hype, and can be a lot more affordable than it seems if you're aware of how rich most of these dishes are - and by the way, if you don't like the rich, hearty food of Quebecois cuisine then this is probably not the place for you.   The only downside we experienced is although we made a reservation a few weeks in advance we weren't able to get a table before 10:00p.m., and when we arrived we ended up waiting over a half hour longer. Additionally, in the bad weather there wasn't anywhere good to wait. Though we were able to look out over the open kitchen, which was fun, we kept getting asked to squeeze back out toward the entrance. However, the staff were very apologetic and bought us a round of drinks and two orders of tempura zucchini blossoms and the food was well worth the wait.   There were five of us, but only four were foodies. We started with the zucchini blossoms and three orders of foie gras cromesquis (little deep-fried cubes of liquid foie gras), then moved on to the seared foie gras poutine for an appetizer. The blossoms were received well by even the non-foodie, and if you like foie gras you will love the cromesquis and the poutine. The non-foodie did have a cromequis but as he'd never had foie gras before it was, to say the least, a bold introduction. So if, like him, you don't love foie gras (which would be silly, but it does happen) take the opportunity to try another of the many excellent-looking options.   For our entrees, four of us split the pied de cochon and the duck in a can. The pied de cochon is huge and comes on the amazing PDC mashed potatoes, which have Quebec cheese curds mashed into them. The duck in a can is something that's worth ordering just for the experience (they really do come to the table with a can opener and dump it out on the toast and cauliflower mash - you can find videos on YouTube) but it was really delicious as well. It wasn't the dish I was most looking forward to (I was pushing for the melting pot) but it ended up being my favourite dish as well - which is saying a lot considering how amazing all of the rest of the food was. Even though it was only half an entree each and one member of our party fasted (well, apart from beer) for the whole day to prepare for our meal we weren't able to finish it (though we came close).  Which is what led to my comment about the price - yes, we had a round of drinks and zucchini blossoms paid for, but it worked out to only $30/person and would have been only around $40/person without the freebies because we knew going in that there would be too much food if we ordered four entrees. Granted, we didn't drink too heavily (we came from Dieu de Ciel, plus for all the amazing food the PDC beer, which we were drinking, is not outstanding), but the estimates you see online of $80/person makes this seem harder to afford than it is. You can have a couple of glasses of beer and easily stay under $50/each as long as you're willing to share (which was easy to do with all of the dishes we had and the servers were not uncomfortable with at all.)  The fifth member of our party ordered the happy pork chop, but he didn't share, the spoilsport. It was huge and looked totally different than any pork chop I've seen before, but delicious (and it smelled that way, too) but the melting pot is still next on my to-try list.  We can't wait to go back. Definitely recommend making the effort to visit."}
{"text":"The food here is so very, very delicious, it can't be adequately described. You can read all about it all over the internet - just know that it's all true. The staff is fun-loving, friendly and helpful. I have nothing bad to say about the experience. In lieu of another long rave about how great a meal at Picard's Cabane a Sucre is, here are some tips:  First, in case you've never looked into trying to come here: You need to request a reservation (which is not guaranteed) months in advance. This seems like a hassle, but the trade-off is that meals are much less expensive than they could be at $59/person before drinks, tax and tip.   Second, while you can make reservations for any size group, tables seat ten people. If you come with fewer then other groups will be put at the same table as you - but each group will be served their own meal. I suspect if there were more than ten of you you could request the number you'd like at each table.  You are going to take home leftovers. Our group of six took home six pounds of leftovers. Don't feel like you should finish any of the courses, because you can't finish all of them.  The cocktails are unique and tasty. Try at least one.   If you own Picard's cookbook, bring it along. He was around when we went and is very friendly and willing to chat with you briefly and sign cookbooks. They also sell the cookbooks at the shack, which include recipes for a lot of the dishes. (At least in Maple Season.)  As others have mentioned, you can look into the kitchen and see them cooking. If it's a nice day arrive early so that you can snoop.   If you do manage to get yourself a reservation, here is the advice that Picard gave me before our first course: \"Please, enjoy everything! And remember to eat slowly... there is a lot of food.\""}
{"text":"What a fabulous experience. This place is certainly not for the faint of heart, or for vegetarians for that matter, but if you like meat and aren't afraid of fat be sure not to miss this place. We had the poutine, the Guinea hen for two, and the strawberry pie, and all three were exceptional. So many interesting dishes, but with such large portion sizes, there just ins't enough room to try everything you want. I definitely plan to come back someday."}
{"text":"Bonjour..  Always amazing.  We do this ever spring.  We drive our RV from Oklahoma City all the way to Montreal and then to Maribel to the amazing 9 course maple syrup inspired feast. Thanks again everyone."}
{"text":"Our friends have been raving about this place for a few years now.  The food was just over the top awesome.  I personally do not eat foie gras, but they had a million ways to have it and it looked so yummy.  The duck with mushrooms was just so tender and tasty and the pork chop (THE BIG ONE) could feed a village.  You need to sit at the bar for the show!  The staff were super friendly and all the cooks were happy to explain what they were doing.  Note: There is one item on the menu that may disturb you (Pigs Head).  Just close your eyes and drink more wine."}
{"text":"Such a delicious little gem in the heart of the plateau...Apart from the high prices, everything else is totally yummy here! mmmmm give it a try! (but I've heard that the \"duck-in-a-can\" isn't all that great so maybe stay away from that!)"}
{"text":"Holy Toledo!  What a feast.  We took the only reservations we could get:  10:00 at the bar.  We took our seats and tucked in.  My colleague is not much for the swine devine, but she found the seafood offering excellent.  For me, the guinea hen liver provided an excellent start.  With the apple jelly to go with it, I felt like I did not need to eat anything for a long time:  I did not want the taste to go away.  The melting pot provided a \"kitchen sink\" approach to the pig:  sausage, blood sausage, a hunk of pork (like a chop kind of meat), and a lardy thing with cheesy mashed potatoes and mushrooms.  Wow.  I did my best, but wound up having to leave the blood sausage only half eaten.  The server said it was okay, no one was judging me on how much I ate.  This hearty meal, while seeming excessive, sat well with me.  The quality of the ingredients and the preparation really came through.  I will return to Montreal, and come here to celebrate."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  It's over the top.  It's inventive.  It's excessive.  It will make your arteries clog and you won't care if this is your last meal.  You can almost feel the grease on the tables and floors when you enter - not kidding.  This is Au Pied de Cochon!   I tried several things here.  The Poutine with Foie Gras, Duck Capparcio, Veal Steak, Duck in a can, Melting pot, the Au Pied de cochon stuffed with Foie Gras.  Everything was fantastic and prepared with maximum flavour.  You'll go into a food coma after but it's well worth the indulgence.  Save your appetite and prepare to detox before and after this meal.   My only issue with the food here is that it is too rich.  It's delicious but the dishes were unbalanced with mostly all meat with rich but smaller sides.  I found myself reaching for some of the bread just to dilute the flavours in my mouth, as the sides tasted very buttered up (although tasty).  Normally, this would enough to bring it down to 4 stars but this place deserves 5 because the prices were very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food and the inventive nature of the dishes was just unmatched.    My recommendations for first-timers is to consider sharing mains because they are huge.  If you don't eat a lot, then sharing a main is probably is a good thing.  If, or I should say when, I do it again, I'll probably force a side or two in the mix to balance the meal better.  Maybe use some apps to replace a main because it could be meat overload for some people.  You can do what you want so don't feel constrained.  Out of everything I tried, the Foie Gras Poutine and Duck Capparicio were stand outs."}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian do not come here. If you are a meatatarian, you will be in heaven!!  Not only does this place have an awesome pig mascot, this place is just a haven for unique meat dishes. Pork and duck and more pork and duck and a lot of foie gras, you can't really go wrong!  5 of us ate here with a bottle of wine and a couple rounds of beers for about $70 per persona and in spirit of the restaurant we definitely left here after pigging out on WAY WAY more food than any normal human should have eaten. We started with the foie gras with berries AMAZING AMAZING, bison tongue which was definitely a new experience, and this absolutely perfectly and wonderfully made Duck Carpaccio. I really wish we had ordered more of this appetizer because it is simply divine! Heaven on a plate for sure.   Then it was onto our 5 main dishes we all split: DUCK IN A CAN was definitely the winner. It was also the priciest  canned food I have ever eaten which would bring canned food drives to a whole new level! They cook the duck and foie gras and sauce and onions before hand, seal it in a can and when you order it for $35 they heat up the whole can on the stove, bring it to your table with a can opener and open it and plop it on a plate! My tastebuds hadn't been happier. That sauce you literally wanted to mop up with anything else leftover on the table.   The pied du cochon or the pigs feet stuffed with foie gras was awesome too and I thought that one would have grossed me out for sure! Again that sauce was bangin! And the beef tartare was definitely refreshing and lighter in feeling than any of the other dishes we had especially when wrapped up as a lettuce wrap! Their happy stew is not for you if you don't like blood sausage because there is a huge healthy portion of that in here but it is pretty darn flavorful. And the loser of the entrees but still pretty good was the lamp and lentils dish. Just didn't quite excite our tastebuds like the other dishes.  And if that wasn't enough, we officially all had muffin tops over our pants when we ordered the creme brulee that was fire toasted with a brand of the restaurant on top! Amazing!!  Man we were all still full the next day, and we definitely had to waddle around like big fat pigs after this meal, but this was one of the best meals I've had in  quite some time. The service was really good too! He tried warning us we were ordering too much, but we showed him!! Even though yes, we really should have never eaten that much, we always like a food challenge!!"}
{"text":"I travel all the time for business and this is one of my favorites. The surprising thing, it's very reasonably priced. The place is always full, so make a reservation (although my first time there I was somehow able to get by without one).   Try the specials, they are amazing. Duck in a can is great. Oh the Bison ribs, a must.  Just try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is the best meal we have had in Montreal. We lucked out at getting a table with no reservation on a Wednesday night at 6:00 pm.   We saw they make their own gin. Asked them to make a drink with the gin. It was great with ginger beer, mint, lime.   Started with the Plogue a Champlain that had foie gras, bacon and maple syrup. Loved the sweet salty combo. My favorite dish.   Next appetizer with beef tongue. So tender.   And then the duck (not the one if the can). It was so much food for two people!  So tender, tasty and lean. The mix with the caramelized onions was so good.   This place was a gem. Can understand the high ratings. A must eat when in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended and it didn't disappoint! A reservation is a must!  The restaurant itself is casual and every inch is  utilize for tables. You will feel a bit wedged in once you're seated but won't care once you start to eat!   There were three of us in our party and we had the following:  - Foie gras poutine which was a nice starter. The gravy was so flavorful, the curds so squeaky and the foie gras was just enough. We were happy the portion was on the smaller side so you don't fill up on fries before the main course.  - Duck in a can which is one of their signature dishes. The duck is actually cooked in the can (for a precise 27 minutes) and they open/plate it right at the table. It was rich but delightful! - Foie gras hamburger .... amazing is not a strong enough word... it is beyond good. Incredibly decedent with the venison burger, foie gras, bacon and fixings, this one is not to be missed! - For dessert we got the milkshake XXX (meaning with booze) and the maple creme brÃ»lÃ©e to top off our meal.  Our experience was excellent from start to finish!"}
{"text":"Sausage in a brioche, with foie gras sauce and grilled asparagus Oreilles de crisse with Ranch sauce Poutine Foie gras Dr Pepper w/ maple syrup.  The sausage was wonderful and the brioche was a nice change from your standard buns. The grilled asparagus was perfectly cooked but there was some stringiness that made cutting though it a bit of a sport. This caused a bit of a structural failure that made eating the sandwich a fun and messy affair. The poutine was too salty for my taste, there being even a bit of salt burn on the tongue. The foie gras on the poutine however was a brilliant and soft counterpoint to the saltiness, as was the hyper-sweetened soft drink. The Oreilles de Crisse were light and crunchy so texturally they were fun but again it was another experience in \"too much\". Deep fried fat will tend to do that. I don't know if I want to fall asleep or just curl up in a corner and have myself a heart attack. 4 stars. Would do this again."}
{"text":"Foie gras. I'd never had it until now and I'm kicking myself for having wasted so much of my life not having tried it. We shared a foie gras appetizer - 100 grams of melt in your mouth softness atop a tiny baked apple torte. while it was delicious, I think that next time I'm going to stick with just a slab of pan seared foie gras tyvm. Our next course was the Magret of Duck atop potatoes, smothered in mushrooms and, god, I can barely remember it was such a blur! While it certainly isn't \"pretty food\" the dish more than made up for looking like a stringy swamp monster with its rich flavours and almost perfectly cooked duck. Our side of PDC mashed potatoes, recommended by a friend of the chef was a mucilaginous clump of heaven. This inspired blend of garlic, cheese curds, and potatoes await you at St Peter's gates if you've been good. Ours arrived 7 minutes after the main. All this we washed down with a perfectly good Morgon leaving no room whatsoever for desert.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will try their Foie gras poutine - if I can figure out which red goes best with it."}
{"text":"TrÃ¨s beau restaurant. J'avais essayÃ© la langue de bison et la Poutine au foie gras. La langue de bison Ã©tait succulente.  La Poutine au foie gras vient dans une petite portion. La sauce est onctueuse et a dÃ©finitivement le goÃ»t de foie gras. C'est un plat original a essayÃ© une fois, mais sans plus.   L'ambiance Ã©tait trÃ¨s conviviale. Le service Ã©tait impeccable et sympathique. Ã y retourner entre amis."}
{"text":"Yes! as a true foodie, traveler....and fan of Anthony Bourdain, I couldn't help but pass by this popular establishment on our last day in Montreal. Situated off the beaten path from the busy St Denis. We walk in around 10pm, no reservations (pun intended). Still got a seat.   It's funny since we just came out of dinner (albeit bad one) an hour and half prior to our arrival. We felt the need anyways to spend some time here. Our order turned out to be light one. Sipped on some fine wine. Then settled for apps like  Cromesquis de foie gras (a little fois gras shot)  and Saucissettes fumÃ©es marinÃ©es (little hot dog smoked sausage) with a side of their fries, made in duck fat. It all turned out pretty good.   Peaking at the tables next to us, we witness the infamous duck in a can meat. Looked yummy. In fact, every single dish we saw looked good. Just wished we had a larger appetite.    Lovely modern simple decor. Service was friendly, laid-back but still very attentive. We even peaked at the main chef (forget his name) walking back in forth in his kitchen & talking some pics with fan.   If ever in this area again, will be sure to hit this spot."}
{"text":"If you can't get a seat, at least get something take out. It's just that good.   Price point was blown by the Duck-in-a-Can, a fantastic concoction of duck and foie gras in stew form with enough butter to kill you. There was nothing wrong with it. In fact, I absolutely enjoyed it even though you lose a bit when you have to eat it out of a take out tray because you forgot to make reservations two weeks in advance.   The thing is this. There are some food items that can feed a family of four. Duck-in-a-Can, while exquisite in both style and substance (100g of foie gras in every can!) for $50, you can get a vastly more substantial meal that does not leave you licking the grease off the plate.   Oh, and do get reservations really really early. I waited til about a week before my trip and it was too late. They're also closed Monday and Tuesday."}
{"text":"Unless you are an absolute fanatic of foie gras, or a gluttonous meat and potato eater, skip this place. We came out of the restaurant feeling exhausted, and disappointed, from voluminous salty dishes and an expensive check (even though we ordered two of the modestly-priced bottles of wines on the list). Service could best be described as glacial as it took almost an hour for our main dishes to arrive. The restaurant is not big, so be ready for elbow-to-elbow seating. It's one of the famed Montreal restaurants and a very popular destination for foodies and tourists. We're New Yorkers, and former residents of Tokyo, who love trying food from street carts to Michelin-starred restaurants. That said, Au Pied de Cochon was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a tendency to overcompensate.   I have been guilty of pushing myself to run 2-3 times the distance of a missed run day on the next day to \"make up\" for lost time; I once went 300 dollars overbudget on a TV because the exact one I've been saving up for was conveniently sold out the day I went to purchase it; I also drove 300 miles to a brewery to buy a case of beer when I found out that my local distribution wells had just sold out.  Foie gras isn't something that I'm known to go nuts about--I've actually only had it once previous to my dining experience at Au Pied de Cochon--but it did bring a slight frown to my face when a state-wide ban on one of the world's three delicacies was instituted a couple years back, depriving me of the oppportunity to ever try it again (at least at my home state)  So you can only imagine my delight when I stumbled upon yet another opportunity to overcompensate, when I learned about a restaurant that pretty much drowns everything in the chopped liver of a stuffed goose while conferring with a friend about a possible trip to MontrÃ©al; I was also amused when I found out that said restaurant also likes to stuff ducks into cans and serve them atop slices of baguettes, but I'll save that story for later.  My Calgarian friend and I ended up at Au Pied de Cochon after making reservations weeks ahead (we tried the same for Joe Beef, but no such luck there.) Once we got to the restaurant, we found ourselves behind a murder of crow-like uppity bachelorette party girls who apparently had been double-booked and waiting for over an hour for the restaurant to accommodate. Whereas this wasn't a great start to the evening, listening to four Indian girls bitch drunkenly about how they think they're better than others and how the restaurant should cater to their every need brought both a chuckle to my face and a glimmering hope that maybe they would shut their annoying pie-holes.  Annoyances you would more often than not experience at fancy world-class restaurants aside, we were promptly seated at the bar by the charming hostess who took our orders at the bar while securing our table in the main dining area. While waiting for the food, I ordered APdC's homebrew ale, which never made its way to me, perhaps because our tables were moved or because they forgot, but it didn't bother me too much.  For the appetizer, we ordered the evening special which was a seafood gratin of sorts baked into a fluffy eggy batter with just the right amount of cheese. I can still remember every bite of that delicious seafood/vegetable filled fake-pie. What's more, is that I remember my friend trying to cut up and eat the cork wood coaster that the gratin was served on.  Next came the Duck Carpaccio -- out of all the thinly sliced meats/fish/vegetables I've tried in my life, this was probably my favorite. The duck was topped with fresh onions and mushrooms, served on top of a dreamy bed of olive oil and a sprinkle of balsamic vinegar.  While the main courses were cooking in the back, our Foie Gras Poutine graced the table like an angel descended from heaven -- my friend and I tried a lifetime's worth of poutine during our 3-day excursion in MontrÃ©al, but we both agreed that this was quite possibly the most exquisite that we'd had. The way the foie gras gravy mixes with the cheese curdles and the fries.... I have absolutely no words to describe the unholy matrimony of the two.  The Stuffed Pied de Cochon was the first of the heavy hitters to land at our table. Think Schweinhaxe meets foie gras, takes her out to romantic first and second dates, and then goes hard and heavy on the third. I never thought I'd ever enjoy eating pig's foot (even though it does appear to be a delicacy in certain regions of my country of heritage), but who can say no when the meat is so tender, juicy, tangy, and tart at the same time? Hell, make anything taste like the aforementioned adjectives, and I'll eat anything -- just don't tell me what it is until I'm done.  And finally, our coup de grÃ¢ce was served to us in the form of a white can with the words \"CANARD EN CONSERVE\" and ungracefully plopped onto a serving plate on top of four finely sliced pieces of baguette. How it landed so perfectly and artfully despite its forceful ejection out of a metal can, I will never know, but one thing is for sure; I have never known life until I've had a perfectly delightful meal served out of a can, and I'm glad that meal took place at Au Pied de Cochon.  Probably one of the top three best meals I've had in my life. I'll definitely be coming back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Called for reservations on December 1st, midnight, didn't actually get a confirmation until mid-Feb. Score! It was our first time in Montreal. We drove up that morning and went to Mirabel for 6pm. A nice drive in a pretty, rural area. Wish we drove out earlier so we could look around some of the other sugar shacks first.  This place was a bit chaotic. Our seating was at 6 and we didn't have to wait. We were at the bar and it was a nice way to talk to the friendly (and typically beautiful - jeez an inordinate percentage of the population of Montreal is really good looking) girls serving us food n' drinks. We started with cocktails - a maple daiquiri and a maple Manhattan. Both were pretty good, but the daiquiri didn't go as greatly with the food itself. We wish we had drank more of the delicious maple beer.  The courses were great and very varied - our favorite was probably the foie gras with baked beans. Or the sturgeon cannelles in mussel sauce. Or the blood sausage and squid ink pasta. Or the ham. I don't even normally like ham, but this was transformative ham. Like, I could cry thinking of that ham. We actually really didn't like the duck dish. There were four desserts, all amazing.  We took home 3 tins of leftovers. It's a lot of food. The whole experience wasn't our favorite of the trip though. It was very sort of touristy, in a way. I know it's a destination, restaurant but there were a lot of big group and photo flashes and loafs of bread stuck with sparkers and things flambeed tableside for show. We felt rushed. Courses kept coming out before we could even try the last dish to come out. It just felt like Get-em-in-get-em-out. I'm grateful we sat at the bar and could at least chat with our server and get a little history, but still, the descriptions of the dish were really minimal.  Despite being so touristy, you can buy the $40 cookbook in the gift shop, but not any actual bottles of maple syrup. Or maple beer. Bummer. We'll probably try to come back again next year, but it'll be with tempered expectations. The food was fantastic, it was the ambiance itself that left me wanting more."}
{"text":"Based on all the good reviews, we had to try this place when visiting Montreal.  3 weeks out, the best time we could get was 10:30 pm on a Sunday.  We took and and planned our day around it.   We arrived 30 minutes early in hopes to get seated a bit early.  It took 5 minutes for the hostess to even show up.  She then said we'd have to wait until our reservation because they were so busy.  As 10:30 came closer, two parties just walked right up without a reservation and got seated immediately.  So I approached the hostess to ask what was up, and she had no idea who I was.  Conveniently, we were seated 2 minutes later.  She is terrible at her job. We got seated and had to wait quite awhile for our  order to be taken.  The waiter seemed put out for having to explain the menu.  After we ordered, he then told us the specials. We were brought bread but no silverware, plates or napkins until we asked for it.  Then our FG Poutine arrived.  It was good, but not great.  The fries were just average and didn't taste like they were fried in duck fat.  And we only got 3 small pieces of FG on the poutine.  Not worth the $22. Then our entrÃ©e came - the duck in a can.  The duck was good, but not great.  It was very sweet, and the FG looked like fat.  It was almost impossible to cut with the dull Target knives they gave us.  I can't believe this entrÃ©e was $44!!  It's not worth half of that. Our server only checked on us once.  The water boy did refill us frequently.  I am shocked that this place is so busy.  It is totally not worth it.  Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"f you want Quebecois fare this is the place to go. We went very late (10:30pm) and didn't have too much trouble getting a table for 2 without reservation (although it was still quite busy).  We ordered the Stuffed PDC with a glass of red wine and finished off with a maple CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lee. The other reviewers were right about the portions! We were able to have another meal with the leftovers. The stuffed PDC was very rich and melt in your mouth tasty. I loved the caramelized onions that did help cut the richness. I was really happy that they offered bread at no cost (We went to another restaurant that charged $6 for bread and butter...what the heck??). The CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lee was divine. The red wine the server recommended was great as well! I'm not even a wine person and I liked it!  We would definitely come back again and try their duck in a can! Thanks for a great meal!  Food - 5/5 Service - 4/5 Atmosphere - 4.5/5 (patio seating, nice but a bit cramped)"}
{"text":"Good and pleasant, but the Duck In A Can, while fun, wasn't as tasty as I'd hoped. Too much cabbage. My wife had a hard time finding something not too heavy..."}
{"text":"Went there this weekend and had a fantastic time. It's my 7th or 8th time and I'm always amazed.I also got to take a picture with Martin Picard. wohoo!  I started off with the their house beer which was delicious.   Then came the foie gras overload...but it rocked my senses.  I highly recommend the 1) Cromesci 2) Duck capaccio 3) duck in can 4) ploc a champlain *** (my favrotie) 5) pecan pie."}
{"text":"If you consider yourself a foodie and a Montrealer, and you've never been here, then you are missing the boat on THE culinary experience. There's nowhere like PDC in the world and it is truly a taste of Quebec's finest cuisine terroir. Unpretentious atmosphere and always superb service accompanies dishes that are all to die for. From the foie-gras cromesquis, duck in a can, foie-gras and boudin tarte, bison ribs to their rotating selection of super original and delicious appetizers, you can't go wrong. Do yourself a favour and go...NOW! Actually you can't. You'll need to reserve a couple of weeks in advance to get a table."}
{"text":"Must go restaurant in Montreal.  My father and I went there for foie gras specifically. So we ordered three dishes with foie gras, cromesquis, fruit FG and duck in a can. They were all very good. My father said it was his first time to have foie gras smooth and soft like this.  The duck in a can came after a long wait, but they compensated us with a plate of prosciutto, which was very good as well, a little too salty I would say. My father also thought that the duck was too oily. I kind of felt in the same way.  Overall it was a great experience. I will come again."}
{"text":"Really can't add much.  Fun atmosphere, great food, minor delays getting seated but the place was jammed so no worries.  Make a reservation!!!  I had the cut of the day, excellent, and took the leftovers out to Mount Royal for a picnic!  Splendid!"}
{"text":"One of the most memorable and decadent meals of my life (and possibly yours). Vegetarians, steer clear: This is a carnivore's paradise. If you love foie gras, blood sausage, and the like, you will absolutely love this place. If you're more of a green juice and kale salad person, pass on this.  I came with a group of 7 and we were so lucky to get a reservation about a week in advance. I've read there are usually horrendous wait times. Definitely come with a group and share everything family style if you can. The portions are so enormous and there are too many things you'll want to get, it's best to sample a little bit of everything.   The sheer amount of meat was overwhelming and potentially heart attack-inducing but I enjoyed so many things about the experience that, from the awesome service, laidback atmosphere, juicy juicy pork knuckles, to the foie gras, that I just have to give it five stars.  Our waiter was friendly and super knowledgeable about the menu. He made our evening that much more fun and made sure we ordered the right dishes and, perhaps more impressively, the right amount. Instead of just encouraging us to get as much as possible, he actually told us to scale back.  Understatement of the year: We ate a LOT. Little cubes of fried, melt-in-your-mouth foie gras. The most tender pork knuckles over a bed of mashed potatoes. SEAL RIBS, a special that we all wanted to try but were not blown away by. Amazing steak. A mouthwatering Monte Cristo (with pork belly, mustard, and french toast). Cassoulet. PDC Melting Pot. The best strawberry pie of my life. And, of course, foie gras poutine. Not every dish was perfect - some were too salty, others too fatty - but the meal was still mind-blowing.   Although I very, very rarely consume this much meat, I will gladly come back here whenever I return to Montreal. In fact, I might return just to eat here..."}
{"text":"Make sure you bring your angioplasty kit because It's a meat party. First, the waitperson  - obsequious woman - dissuaded us from ordering any side greens. Weird. Then we asked her to guide us so we didn't over-order. What did she do? She pushed an $80 special on us that we didn't even touch. Everyone raves about this place, but I'm not sure what all the fuss is for."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ on a stick covered with strawberry jam. (tasteless pun totally intended) There is no word in the English language that can describe this place. Perhaps that's why the French have such fantastic slang. (ie: crowded balcony) ...sidetracked a bit.  This establishment has possibly shot up to my top 3 list of restaurants for simply one reason (of many). Foie gras.  Our group of 4 managed to get a reservation the day before... and from what I've heard, its a damn miracle. Arrived early, sat early. We began ordering almost everything on the menu that has foie gras in it. Thankfully our waiter was courteous enough to tell us we totally over ordered. We very politely told him to shove it and only took off one item on our list because we are fat and hungry.  This was our order: Foie gras Burger (split between 4) Full Foie gras poutine Tuna collar (off menu, feeds 3) Duck in a can and finally Pied de cochon.  We started with a foie gras burger and the foie gras poutine. I... I think it's the first time I've ever wanted to cry during a meal... I always knew (in theory) that cooking is a form of art. This meal confirmed it. Such emotions came over me but I held it together because I didn't want to look like some kind of pansy in front of my friends... and fellow diners.  When they swapped our small plates for giant dinner plates, we knew we were @#$%ed...  First came the pied de cuchon. Deboned pig leg.. Trotters were made in to a fried pate with horseradish paste on top. Then came our tuna collar... that thing could have easily taken up a single 2 person table. I'm pretty sure that collar came off of 700lb+ tuna. And finally, came the duck in a can. The duck is cooked in a can. Simple as that. I got a kick out of it when they cracked open the can and just poured it on the plate.   The flavors were unimaginable... and I have a pretty damn good imagination... I think there was a tear or two rolling down my face by the end of the meal. And I felt my heart coming close to exploding. It hurts SO GOOD!  I would move to Montreal for this place alone... but then I would be fat. And poor."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side, and it can be difficult to get a reservation, but overall I've never been disappointed by the food or the service.  If you like foie gras, the foie gras poutine is an excellent choice.  Had their bison tartare and their duck carpaccio, which were both great.  Also had a specialty sushi roll that was on offer that night, which surprised me (as it's not French), but was certainly just as delicious as the rest of the food.  My dining companion raved about the onion soup."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Montreal !!! Definitely recommend you guys try this place, and you will love it so much!!!  My friends and I went there for dinner during our traveling in Montreal this July. One of my friends has made the reservation a couple of days before our arrival, and this restaurant is always very crowded. When we left there around 11:30 p.m., there were still several people waiting for seats.  This is a French bistro. The wooden interior decoration and a large liquor cabinet as the background creates a bright, sweet, and warm dining atmosphere. You will want to take a drink and enjoy a fun night unconsciously.   Every dish looked very home-made, and in a large size, especially the main courses. We have tried the foie-gras terrine as the appetizer. The maple syrup sauce was really a big surprise, not to mention the rich and creamy foie-gras itself with the crunchy bread.  We also tried the wine boiled pork shank with risotto. It tasted soooo great!! You could feel the soft and rich pork melt in your mouth, and your lips become a little sticky. The bacon topping brought another different texture as well. I personally really really love this course, it feels like I was in my grandmother's kitchen. The other main dish we ordered was baked pork shank with foie-gras and mashed potato. The crispy pork skin, the mushrooms, the creamy potato, and the foie-gras matched each other very well. They all together helped me to feel different layers of this course. Although the sauce was a little bit salty, I still feel that I could forget all the troubles just because I had this meal. The house special alcoholic drink (made by sake) was smooth. And the dessert drink (maple milkshake) made a happy ending for this dinner, though it was too sweet for me.  We got nice service, and the server almost could answer any question we had about the restaurant and the dishes. We also saw other tables ordered charcuterie, and the server sliced a large ham in front of us. That was really cool, and I would like to try that next time.  Considering the price, the food quality, the service, and the dining environment, this place is worth to try and come back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Service:    * Fantastic service and upbeat, friendly staff.  Ambience:    * I spent a week in Montreal and dined out as much as my schedule permitted.  Of all the fancy French and Italian places that I dined at, I liked the unpretentious and casual environment of this restaurant.  It was warm, open, with display of their seafood, and very energetic.  Food, Portion, and Quality:    *  I regret not trying the pork dishes and opted for lobster and seafood.  Not able to provide too much review on food, but I would not order my dishes again.  Drinks:    * We had beer and cocktails, made by a super cute and friendly bartender.  The drinks went well with our meal."}

If it were strickly for the food, this place would get a 5 star bar none. However, being in Montreal, the service left a lot to be desired.  This fantastical place is a meat lover's delight. PDC creates superb dishes out of the entire animal. There is so much deliciousness on the menu it takes multiple visits to truly sample everything.  I was here recently while visiting friends in Montreal. We arrived and were seated at the back of the very cramped restaurant (even on a Tuesday night!) You definitely need to make a reservation on any evening. Our waiter came by and described the menu and made a point of assuring us that everything was on the menu tonight. I thought it was a little odd since you'd expect them to HAVE everything if it's on the menu... anyways. We also ordered a few drinks and a bottle of wine, which in infamous Montreal style took a couple of reminders for them to bring it over.  So I really wanted to try the Oreilles de crisse, to see PDC's take on a bit of deliciousness often enjoyed in my childhood. Unfortunately, unlike promised, it was NOT available that night. Apparently neither was the wine we wanted. Why our waiter made a point of telling us everything was on the menu when SEVERAL things we asked for were clearly not, is beyond me.   So instead, I tried the Cromesquis de foie gras (little cubes of deep fried fois gras) and the Saucissettes fumÃ©es marinÃ©es for appetizers. The cromesquis were absolutely fantastic. At $3.50 for two, these little delights are worth it. The smoked saussage was pretty meh. Like a more flavourful, less salty Slim Jim. For the main course, I tried the much Yelped about fois gras poutine. Say what you will about fois gras but daaaamn that was the best poutine this Quebecois has evar tasted!  Overall, PDC is a great restaurant and I've been assured that the service is usually better. I will just have to go back and see for myself. Although at $100 a head with drinks for dinner, it won't be anytime soon!"}
{"text":"It actually took me awhile to make a reservation here. I called in one or two weeks in advance, and I had to choose between a 10pm table or 5pm. As my partner and I are not late night snackers/eaters, we chose the 5pm. Lesson here is call very early to book. Even when we went in, we see people walking in and asking for a table - they were always rejected.   In terms of decor - it's very  nice. I really like how they grow rosemary outside their restaurant and harvest it afterwards. When you walk by, you get that whiff of rosemary smell. When you get into the restaurant, depending on where you sit, you can see how they function in the kitchen. The spaces are indeed a little tight. But not so small that you cannot walk through.  My partner and I ordered the duck in a can, Beef tartare temaki, Maple creme brulee. I was exceptionally surprised at how amazing every single dish was. My absolute favourite had to be the duck in a can. I saw so many people raving about it. But was a little hesitant because I'm not much of a duck fan. But wow, it was so tender, and flavorful. Absolutely worth that $$$ price tag. The Beef Tartare Temaki was also veery good, and the Creme Brulee was quite large. Amazing food. Period.   Service here was also impeccable. Our waiter was humorous, quick, and attentive. I was so impressed by the overall experience. I would definitely come back again when I visit Montreal. I would love to try the other options that were recommended!"}
{"text":"I just recently went to Montreal in what was my first trip to Canada, and I had known about this restaurant through a Canadian friend's suggestion. I looked it up on Youtube and went nuts watching Anthony Bourdain eating there.  I was so pumped I did a few Internet searches and read reviews, including Yelp's, to get an idea of what to expect and to order dishes I knew I'd like. And I'm glad I did my homework.  The foie gras cromenisques just... melted. Literally. 2 or 3 seconds and you forget it was fried. Delight, in pure form. The tarragon bison tongue was quite soft, and the flavors were very rich. Then, the foie gras poutine. Please note: I am not someone who likes fries and rarely eat them, but I couldn't pass this up... I never imagined fries w/ gravy, cheese, and yes, foie gras could be so decadently good.  Up to now, great. A confluence of amazing flavors, all very rich.  Then, the duck in a can. My only disappointment in what was probably the most unique and creative dish I've ever eaten was that it was not as large as I thought it'd be. A few reviews said it was a very large portion, but at nearly 6' tall I wasn't too impressed w/ the size. My friend, in contrast, ordered the pied de cochon which I must say wasn't the best dish. The onions were fine, but they were too rich, and he did at least finish the pork. He was fuller than I was; otherwise, I would've ordered the cured foir gras & boudin tart as I'm a huge lover of boudin/blood sausage.  This was so worth it... such a cool restaurant with very unique food. I'm tempted to go to Montreal again ONLY to eat here! And I probably will, soon enough."}
{"text":"Super dÃ©licieux mais pour le prix j'aime mieux aller Ã Ma grosse Truit chÃ©rie."}
{"text":"Definitely our best dinner yet. Au Pied de Cochon I'm so in love with your Foie Gras--  it's practically in every dish.  The Foie Nigiri is out of this world (w/peanut butter -- trust me, it so freaking awesome) the temaki tartare and the tuna belly cooked on a salt brick w Foie both spectacular, Pot Au Feu (braised chicken, shank, bone marrow and Foie --  so delish. (For you pinoys, it's a French nilaga - we had to ask for a side of rice (waitress was confused - but it was that good)), the maple pecan pie was 2die4 so leave room for that, it's a hot day in Montreal so we went w a Sancerre Rose to compliment our meal, wine list is extensive, service is swift and vibe is casual and neighborhoody -- I heart this place and will definitely be back the next time I'm in #montreal. Merci PDC Merci. You gave this foodie her most memorable meal. Au Revoir!"}
{"text":"Jeez what can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. Lets just say if I could drive up to Montreal once a week just to eat there I would do it!! A highlight of my life as a foodie. This is indulgence, extravagance a lifetime event. My last trip was in January and I ordered the foie gras duo and my partner in crime had the Beef Rib. The Burger has changed and now it has meat in it. But the Poutine was amazing as ever.  The food is heavy as expected and I needed a two hour walk just to be able to think about sleeping! Keep it up Martin for us Foie Gras Luvers! ( I wish you could add more beer selection as I am sure some Belgian Stuff will match well with the food here) or even local stuff  from Unibrue like La Fin Du Mode, Maudite etc!! There is nothing like this place! Tip: If you like to buy foie gras for use at home this place sells them at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"If you're on the deathbed and you get one final meal, then I recommend this place. If you don't like French food or foie gras then oh wellz.  Personal favorites:  1. foie gras poppers 2. roast pork glazed in honey and yummy goodness 3. steak with foie gras 4. foie gras milkshakes (jk)  Do the P90x workout before you come here because you will gain it all back.   Good luck"}
{"text":"Wow.  This was quite the experience!  Definitely someplace everyone should try at least once-- it was probably the most unique culinary experience I've ever had.  The little, melt in your mouth, fried fois gras pieces are a must.  Besides that we had pate, shepherd's pie, bison steak and the PDC melting pot (which included a huge helping of black pudding, among other pig delicacies).  My son ate so much he puked... literally.  But, it was a good kind of puke, if there is such a thing. ;-)    My only advice would be to not plan anything at all after your dinner at Pied De Cochon.  Besides the fact that you will be way too full to do anything that involves motion, the dinner here takes forever.  We were seated at 7:45pm and did not leave until 11:45pm.  There was literally about an hour between each course, so if your meal is anything like ours was, you're gonna be here for a while!"}
{"text":"We just dined here over the weekend. It was everything that people say. After seeing this recommended by the great Anthony Bourdain, it did not disappoint. If you like Foie Gras, this is the place. They had a menu of it with different combinations . In any form and we had about four different kinds to taste, all was delicious.  Either naked, baked, fried  or in a combination, all equally great. Every course had different forms of The Foie Gras and all was equally delicious.  We also had the Veal Carpaccio and it came with a duck egg to spread across the dish before eating. This was also amazing. Paired with great wine and really not too expensive  considering this is a Marc Piccard restaurant. Make certain you secure a reservation. Without one you will not get in."}
{"text":"A Montreal experience par excellence.  Friendly service, great atmosphere, superb food, and an extensive wine list.  While many reviewers write about having gorged themselves, it's also possible to have a delicious meal that won't instantly clog your arteries and empty your wallet.  In fact, the food itself is very reasonably priced, it's the wine where they get you - we loved the house Cotes du Rhone, though.  We ordered: 1 bottle cotes du rhone ($55) foie gras balls appetizer tomato tartlet tomato salad (special) bison tartare (fries included) happy pork chop lemon meringue pie 2 glasses sancerre  total $171 plus tip"}
{"text":"A must for someone new to Montreal. Definitely, a rich taste of true Quebec cuisine  using top local ingredients and no fuss.  Warning not to be frequented by calorie counting individuals."}
{"text":"Place was packed, we couldn't get a reservation until 10PM but it was worth the wait! We had the buckwheat pancake foie gras to start which was amazing with this maple syrup/balsamic glaze, so so good.  For our main course we had the (special) fried green tomatoes with goat cheese and foie gras (of course) and the duck in a can (pricey at $44) which was super interesting and delicious. Very very rich though, couldn't finish it but it was crazy good! Def. recommend!"}
{"text":"This is where we went tonight. We had fresh eel, foie gras, and duck in a can. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place other than it is probably one of the best restaurants to eat in Montreal.  You have to try it to even comprehend the types of food and flavours involved in the stuff they are making here.  On top of all this book in advance if you want to try it!  I had to book well in advance to even get a spot and the earliest spot I was able to get was a dinner at 10:30pm at night.  I guess everyone knows about how great this place is along with the tourists as well.  My gf and I ordered  Duck in a Can, Foie Gras Poutine and the massive sized, Au Pied de Cochon.  I must say I have never eaten that much foie gras in my life let along in one sitting!  The poutine a staple dish in Montreal dining, was creamy and different than anything I'm used to having.  The piece of foie gras they placed on it was gigantic as well, about 10x larger than any fine dining restaurant I've been to.  Duck in a can was amazing, the presentation was unique and the taste was something unexpected.  So many flavours and juicy tasting duck crammed into a tiny can was incredible.  And the masterpiece known as Au Pied de Cochon, was huge!  The pork was very tender and went really well with the massive foie gras they placed on top.  This was so large of a dish we couldn't finish it and ended up eating it for the next 3 days!    Overall an amazing experience and I really loved the atmosphere.  Portions are ginormous here so keep that in mind when ordering.  The prices to me were justified based on the amount of food you get along with the ingredients used.  I literally had a couple of pounds worth of foie gras that night, so I was surprised the bill wasn't more.  I am definitely coming back here again if I can somehow get a reservation again!"}
{"text":"El sitio es muy lindo, el ambiente , la mÃºsica , la Luz es excelente. Empezamos con JamÃ³n Cabane,  delicioso la  de servirlo y con biscochos, vino delicioso, el plato fuerte Carnard en Conserve fue uno de los platos recomendados por el Manager que es muy gentil y se acerca directamente a saludarnos y a recomendarnos lo mejor de la casa , tambiÃ©n cenamos Poutine au foine gras.  Delicioso. El plato mÃ¡s recomendado es el Cotes de Boeuf Vieillies se ve que es delicioso el precio 90 dÃ³lares, asÃ­ quÃ© hay que estar preparado por que vale la pena pagar ese precio"}
{"text":"A 4.5 star restaurant for sure!   Good thing i made a reservation.  I was able to secure a seat by the bar at 9:30pm last Saturday night.  Yes, that is normal dining time for the locals.  I love being seated by the bar/kitchen because i get to watch all the actions and feel the energy.  They have quite a few beers on tab and good wine selections.   We had this crab in puff pastry as an appetizer which is not on the menu, it's so amazing: fresh crab with a little bit marinated and fresh greens sitting between perfectly crisped pastry shells, yumm!  we also had beef tartare.  I'm not a beef person, and i hesitated when the young lady next to me recommended it.  it turned out to be amazing as well.  It was exemplary in taste, presentation and execution.   we had special risotto and duck in a can for entrees.  Duck in a can is pretty good, a little salty for me, but it's pretty good.  I loved the risotto they made in front of me:  they mixed pre-made risotto and a pan of pre-made sliced mushrooms and some foie gras in a huge cheese bowl.  It is very yummy, but really filling.  we also ordered poached pear with ice cream, that was a little too sweet for me."}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon is bad, and it's bad in a disingenuous way that is insidious and upsetting. It simultaneously wants to be upscale and populist - Poutine, but with foie gras! Lobster rolls, but with foie gras! Chicken nuggets, but with foie gras and maple syrup! A fun-house restaurant like this could be excused for the many, many lapses in service, quality, and good taste. However, the prices and officious service make it very clear that this is a \"serious\" restaurant and demands to be judged as such.   I won't complain too much about the overbearing wine service, as it was the only time in the multi-hour meal where any server seemed to remember that their job was to serve. I hesitate to even refer to the men and women in matching shirts as servers, since they seemed to spend the evening engaged in some kind of Olympic qualifying event involving running, shouting, and breaking dishes.  Before I document the numerous outrages of the service, perhaps we should discuss the food? Perhaps you're wondering what the titular and famed Au Pied de Cochon (pig's foot) stuffed with foie gras tastes like? I also wonder - it was out by the time we were seated, and our dilatory waitress (the first of many) deigned to stop by -- approximately 30 minutes later. The pig's head for two was also out. And the crab. And tartare. That eliminated roughly 40% of the menu, and essentially all the things for which APdC is known. One can't help but wonder why a restaurant would have a 9:00 seating if all the food is gone.   The waitress tried to upsell us on some specials , including a gnocci made in a hallowed-out wheel of parmesan, the cart for which was rushed around by frantic waiters through the evening. Unfortunately, my dining companion's chair was inconveniently situated in the dining area, and often in the way of this cart. My friend spent his dinner being jockeyed aside by the harried server.   When we needed time to consider what food to order, our waitress (#1) disappeared for another 30 minutes - undoubtedly to give us time to peruse the remaining 8 menu items. This was interrupted only by the first appearance of the wine steward who informed us that the bottle we ordered was out.  When our waitress finally reappeared (my companions and I now having grown beards and birthed children, who in turn had given us many grandchildren, bringing joy and delight into our lives), I was heavily sold on the PDC Melting Pot--it was a \"staff favorite\". No sooner had I ordered it then I was informed it, too, was out. Here's what we ended up managing to order from the apparently empty kitchen:  * Foie Gras Cromesquis - foie gras croquettes with a liquefied center, imagine a hybrid croquette and Xaio Ling Bao with foie gras. These were very good.  * Duck Carpaccio - doesn't need description. Tasty if unremarkable.  * Chicken Nuggets with Foie Gras - Well-seasoned, deep fried boneless chicken with foie gras with maple syrup on the side. Also good. Foie gras added nothing, though.  If the meal ended there I would consider this a good if unremarkable restaurant with atrocious service. Unfortunately, we made the error of moving to main courses. I ordered the \"famous\"(?) pork chop and my companions had the famous Duck in a Can, but of which resembled unappetizing brown mush.   Both the duck and the pork chop were tough and somehow bland. Did I mention both came in a thin brown sauce that slopped around the plate? I should have, as our waitress (#3) nearly spilled all of it on my shirt when she tossed it on the table.   Thanks to the long waits between seeing a server, we were spared ordering dessert, which undoubtedly they would have been out of anyway. Once the bill arrived, we finally had attentive service -- the wine steward somehow noticed a bottle was left off our bill within seconds and snatched it away to inflate the final invoice. It was the first sign of efficiency, competence, or haste the entire evening, unfortunately coming at our expense.  The final insult arrived after we'd paid the bill when the maÃ®tre 'd arrived to ask how everything was. One of my companions added that we'd had water dripping on us all evening (true). The captain 1) denied all knowledge, 2) basically claimed it wasn't happening, and then said he would 3) look into it once we pointed out the water drops clustered on the ceiling above. \"In all my 7 years,\" the captain mused, \"I've never seen that happen.\" Strange, as an hour before we'd seen one of his staff come out and wipe the ceiling with a cloth on a pole, made obviously for this specific problem.   I mentioned before that I think this type of food and service is bad and insidious. Dining like this tricks people into thinking this is what \"fancy\" or \"upscale\" food is like - worse versions of things they eat cheaply (poutine, chicken nuggets) served with a sneer. Like all that is pretentious, it is a strange combination of sickening, embarrassing to watch, and infuriating. This is a must-avoid."}
{"text":"OMG!  I've been looking forward to this meal for months!  That's how far in advance you have to book.  It's good to plan ahead, especially coming in from another city, in my case, Toronto.  I've heard apple season isn't as good as maple syrup season but guess what?  I will take what I can get!    Our drive to this location wasn't too bad since we were staying in the west island.  That in itself saved us a solid 30 minutes.  It's approximately an hour drive from downtown Montreal.    Upon arrival, we walked around the grounds, took some photos, and eagerly awaited the feast that was soon to come.    I had booked for 4 people and were assigned bar seats.  This was good in the sense that you're not cramped on a bench, but you sit with your dining companions in a row, so not conducive to dinner conversation.  Let's face it, it was all about the food anyways!  If you've got a group of 8-10 (maybe even 12) you get an entire communal dining table, similar to a giant picnic table.  I think the one square table was the best seating arrangement for a large group.    If you have allergies, you're kind of screwed.  They don't make changes to the dishes so you just make do with what you can eat.  The server will inform you about which dishes won't cause you an epipen episode.    Onto the food: 6 appetizers, 3 mains, and 5 desserts.    1. Tomato soup served from the can with a PDC Campbell's style label, with puffy bread and sausage (good). 2. Baked oyster for each person topped with a chunk of foie gras (good). 3. Squid ink pasta with ricotta (cannelloni) (amazing). 4. Another pasta with tofu (good). 5. Vietnamese style fresh roll but with sliced meats (kinda weird). 6. Fried calf brains on roasted cauliflower (delicious).  1. Pork served with sweetbreads, turnips, and carrots (good). 2. Mackerel served with eggplant, zucchini, peppers, and chickpeas (good).  Tagine from the outdoor smoker! 3. Meatloaf with Brie and potatoes wrapped with bacon topped with Brussels sprouts (way too heavy).  1. Lemon cake layered with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sorbet, surrounded with meringue topped with whipped cream and some plums (amazing). 2. Pear something (good). 3. Strawberry pie (good). 4. Chocolate tart (good). 5. Some other baked goodness (good).  I'm not sure I like the idea of dining while scooping extra food into containers on the side.  I hate wasting food, but seriously, the portions here are just insane.    The value is unbelievable for the quality, quantity, and variety of food.  $55 per person for the apple season.    The bar has a good selection of drinks to satisfy everyone.    After everything was all said and done, I would recommend this as a unique dining experience for people who are adventurous and who love food, especially meat.  Vegetarians and vegans need not apply.  Don't come and give a crappy review because they don't have anything for you.     I'm definitely going to try for the maple syrup season!"}
{"text":"One of the most unique culinary experiences that Montreal has to offer , the food is hearty and most importantly HONEST, and it's bloody finger and arm licking delicious , the chef managed to hit the magic formula of keeping the authenticity of old French cuisine while experimenting with unpretentious creativity . I have  eat there 3 times before writing this review, although the stuffed pork leg with the fois gras sauce and the canned canard are my favorites , the wooden oven cocked Brussels sprouts with bacon is irresistible, every single dish on the menue worth trying , the restaurant isn't cheap as the comfortable casual decor could make you assume but it's worth it , oh and the wine selection is great, the sommelier is expert and HONEST , he doesn't try to sale to you the most expensive bottle, he knowledgeably helps you in making a good choice without breaking the bank , the service is excellent and remarkably friendly, well done , chapeaux bas"}
{"text":"Indulgent Monstrosities. That is what you are paying to battle in Au Pied de Cochon. Huge portions of delicious delicious beasts imaginatively cooked, outrageously decadent, and quite often topped with foie gras.   This is a popular destination so be prepared to make a reservation (via email or phone) at the very least a month in advance. Make sure to confirm my reservation the night or the day of via email/phone. I failed to confirm my reservation the first time I came here and when we showed up our name was not on the list. Luckily we didn't wait long to be seated.  The interior is casual and cool;  with a accordion windowed doors in the front that opens in the summer and hanging pendant lights with Edison bulbs. The layout is a little weird and somewhat cramped. The bathrooms are at the end of the bar/ kitchen area. If you're seated in the front, it is an odyssey to dodge and duck your way to the bathroom. Service each time was friendly and quick despite a crowded night.  The food is amazing. Luxuriously rich and served in gluttonous amounts. You need to be a rotund competitive eater to be able to eat everything.  -Duck Carpaccio 14 It looks like art and it tastes fantastic. Drizzled with olive oil and the yolks of some unknown fowl, each bite is unctuous goodness.  -Foie Gras Poutine  24 This is probably my favorite poutine dish. Creamy rich fattiness over crisp fries. You just have to order this. -Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras 45 This could probably feed 3 to 4 people comfortably. Its pigs foot cooked til the skin is delightful crisp, covered with creamy sauce, over some wonderful mash of potato married with cheese. All crowned with an obscenely huge chunk of foie gras.  -Duck in a Can  44 I ordered this the first time I came here. It is an experience you should have when you're in Montreal. The duck breast with foie gras is cooked in the can. The meat basically cooks in this rich fatty bath. They open the can at the table and dump the contents on a plate of some creamy puree. It is incredibly rich. Be careful not to order too much if you plan on ordering this. -If it appears on the menu again get the Foie gras Tout Nu. Heavenly morsels that melt in your mouth with this dark thick sauce that makes your taste bud sing. This was my first taste of foie gras and it was an experience. -My husband got Horse tartare the last time we were here. It was a humongous portion and came with crispy a yummy fries. The horse tartare was seasoned beautifully. It had a nice heat and was so flavorful.  Drinks are great. I had a bourbon cocktail with maple syrup ($12) and my husband got the cream ale ($6). Despite already coming here twice and despite there being so many other places I would like to visit in Montreal, it would be hard for me to resist the temptation of coming here.  Fight the urge to order everything. It is a great experience to dine so sinfully."}
{"text":"Perhaps my taste buds and Asian background is not geared for the ultra rich dishes this fine restaurant has to offer. We found the dish mostly doused with a large dose of froi grois which in small measures adds flavor but in large amounts just too rich too fat for my liking. I cannot imagine French people eating such rich food everyday.   Service food presentation and even price were all great. Just not to our preference."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant; every single damn thing tasted amazing! We came in a group of 3 and order 2 main courses & 1 appetizer. Too much food, but because they were too good we didn't care. Definitely recommend duck in a can and, if available, pied de cochon!"}
{"text":"I love Anthony Bourdain and was hoping to catch him in one of his favourite restaurants in Montreal. My hubby is quite addicted to foie gras so I took him here for his birthday. We are not big eaters so we went with the server's recommendation: plogue a Champlain, foie gras nigiri and meatloaf made with hare, etc. Everything is incredibly good, we didn't have room for dessert, so we took the pecan pie back to the hotel. I will be back here to try the duck in a can, and other items in the menu"}
{"text":"We ate here during a visit to Montreal this summer (August). Hating rejection, I e-mailed a week or so in advance for a reservation, and they phoned me back to confirm. After a day of hoofing it around the city, we walked right past this place twice since it doesn't have a sign. However, upon calling them for help we found it right there in plain sight. We were seated promptly and then sat there forsaken and forlorn for about ten minutes, my pet peeve. The reason for this was apparently that there was just one waitress for the front seating area and she took all the time needed to explain dishes and answer questions for each table, hence the wait. (Some self-absorbed diners love to inordinately monopolize servers with their inane queries instead of using the internet.) Anyhow, if you did your five minutes of homework, you know to order: pork and foie gras. We started with the delicious fried zucchini blossoms and a simple salad, then on to the stuffed pig's foot with foie. It was awesome, and awesomely rich. My wife, who is near-vegetarian, threw herself with gusto into disassembling this earthy, collagen-laden treat, served atop mashed potatoes, cooked vegetables and a thick demi-gravy. Whatever magical treatment they did there was absolutely no stink of cochon associated with this trotter, only yummy goodness. Yes, we did finish it, but there was no room for dessert. We had a French red the details of which now escape me. The place is pretty loud and tightly packed. I wouldn't call it comfortable, more down-to-the-business-of-eating, a money mill. A table of Asian tourists nearby provided diversion in the form of ordering and photographing endlessly an entire pig's head (served with a lobster as crown). Wish I had room for more!"}
{"text":"This place is so kick ass.  It's a bit rustic/bar-like, and the menu holds wonders galore.  Seriously.  This little square with a liquid foie center freaking me out.  And then I had this orgasmic foie dish with pancake, potato, bacon, two pieces of pan-seared foie gras, and a confit of egg and maple in a maple sauce... aaarrrrggggarrgggggle... oi!  Needless to say, I needed a cappuccino after the meal.  And they make their cappuccinos uber duber strong.  To match the heavy orgasmic, melting goo of deliciousness they serve.  Oi!"}
{"text":"Anthony Bourdain referred to Au Pied De Cochon as a temple to all things fatty, porky, and duck related.  I would also like to add oh-so-yummy.  This was our first meal in Montreal and there couldn't have been a better place start to a lovely trip.   I booked reservations a few weeks in advance which seemed to be a smart move as the restaurant was packed non-stop throughout the evening. The restaurant itself is cozy and the simple decor reminded me a lot of Avec in Chicago.  I also love that APDC maintains a fairly casual atmosphere.  There is nothing better than eating delicious food at a restaurant that doesn't take itself too seriously, even if the food is seriously great.  A major factor which attributes to APDC earning a 5 star rating is their service. Everybody, from the hostess to our waiter to the various running staff here, were so delightfully pleasant and so attentive.  I immediately felt an affinity towards the awesomeness of my fellow Canadians.  On to the eats:  Beef Tartare I really liked the presentation on APDC's beef tartare. For a second I thought I was in a sushi restaurant but a beef tartare hand roll makes for a scrumptious appetizer.    Tomato Tartlet I'm guessing that this is the name of the dish as this was the only tomato anything I saw on the menu.  We ordered this dish since it seemed like every table around us had ordered it.  I love me some tomatoes and this dish was refreshingly tasty.  The pesto in the olive oil combined with what I'm guessing to be crumbled mascarpone was a perfect complement in this dish.  Clams This has got to be the best clam dish I've had.  Perfectly steamed in the most delicious creamy sauce that had a slight taste of parmesan. I'm salivating just thinking about it.   Duck in a can  The presentation is quite fun to watch.  While all the components of this dish are prepared well, the first few bites were great and then it became savory overload for me.  But that's just my taste, my boyfriend quite enjoyed the dish overall.   Foie Gras Poutine My favorite of the evening.  I love poutine!  I only wish I could find some in socal.  APDC had the best gravy for their poutine that I've ever had. And the foie gras was like morsels of special yumminess in each bite.   Poached Pear with Vanilla Ice Cream When this dessert was delivered to our table, we thought, wow - that really IS a poached pear.  But it was the most refreshing dessert that I've ever had.  The vanilla ice cream was a perfect complement to the pear which was fresh and juicy.    Overall, I would definitely come to APDC again the next time I go to Montreal.  Hopefully with a larger party so that we could sample more of the menu. I'm sure there is much more fatty, porky, duck related goodness that I've still yet to discover."}
{"text":"Caveat to the star rating above: if you love rich, heavy, tasty food you would love Au Pied de Cochon. I simply do not.   You might say \"why go to PDC?\" I thought I like a rich buttery flavourful meal once in a while but PDC is simply over the top for me. I ate the foie gras and boudin tart. I could only finish 1/3 of the pie at the restaurant and took the rest back to our hotel for lunch the next day. But the tart bested me even in a second attempt! I couldn't even fully finish the leftovers.   We also tried skatefish special (too buttery) and poutine temaki (good but nothing that wow's me).   I can see why many here love PDC but it is not the place for me.  That being said, service is very friendly and good here. All the servers are bilingual as many people are in Montreal. I made a reservation for Valentine's Day via email and received a prompt reply and confirmation the same day. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table when we arrived. But given how popular the restaurant is -- especially on  Valentine's -- I felt it was understandable. Even though it was a busy night, I never felt rushed or ignored."}
{"text":"I was starving at the end of an exhausting week at a conference in Montreal. My well traveled Hungarian friend from Silicon Valley suggested I look up restaurants that Anthony Bourdain had recommended. So I ended up at Au Pied de Cochon completely ill prepared, Little did I know that typically reservations can be made months in advance. As I came through the door as a party of one they asked if I had a reservation I said no and the maÃ®tre d' said I'm sure we can find a place for you would you mind sitting at the bar? And of course I would prefer that anyway. I was unaware that this was going to become my indoctrination to real French food. I'm not going to mention the dishes that I ate, they were specials of the day and you probably will not find them when you visit this place. But I ate things that I would've never ordered in another situation and they were delicious. I was fortunate to be seated next to a gentleman who is a regular and a favorite of the chef so throughout dinner I experienced an array of delicacies I would have avoided in another situation. To summarize it's a wonderfully special restaurant, if you're a foodie it's a must."}
{"text":"OKAY, so you've arrived via the most un-necessarily large airport in North America and that is Montreal's Pierre Trudeau International Airport. Once you finally arrive downtown to the beautiful city of Montreal, it's a must to have French food. We were staying at the Westin Montreal which is my go to hotel and around the corner, was Au PDS. Here's how it went down...  Food: + Cromesquis de foie gras. $3.50. It was succulent, sauteed and done well. Paired fantastically with our Bordeaux. + Carpaccio de Canard. $13. Lovely, fantastic and amazing. That's all I have to tell you, order it. DUCK. YES. + Deer Ribs. $28. OMG YES!!!!! hahahah I love deer and all deer related products. GO FOR IT. + Chocolate Molten cake. $7. It was done in a ramekin, the way it should be and it was done very well. Firm yet moist on the outside, soft gooey and warm on the inside. Once you cut in to it, it kinda' fell apart. HAHHHAHA!!! LOVED IT!!!  Service: - The service was a bit quirky. It's not the level of service I'd expect in a French restaurant and although it wasn't that busy, it was still tough to track servers down let alone our own.  Overall? I'd go back especially since it's walking distance from the hotel and it was a pretty good restaurant with ample seating and was cozy.  THIS has been a review by Gaurav"}
{"text":"Highly Recommended.  Get the Duck in the Can, Foie, and the Burger. And order some stuff to share at the table.   Au Pied de Cochon is famous from its appearance on the Anthony Bourdain hosted No Reservations episode in Quebec. http://www.travelchannel.com/tv-shows/anthony-bourdain/travel-guides/quebec  My first love here will always be the duck in a can (44.00$) which you can order to go since it'll last 2-3 days if refrigerated. This may very well be the best thing I ever ate that I didn't cook. half a duck breast, 100g of foie gras, mushrooms, half a head of garlic, and vegetables.  The Foie gras shots are a winner to start with. Small, simple, superb.  The Foie gras 'tout nu' is a very close second. Its simplicity is its strongest suit. Balsamic glazed seared foie gras atop large crustinis.  If you want to turn the tout nu on it's head, but with the same flavors, go with the Foie gras hamburger, this massive beast of a burger will leave you with no regrets.  The Foie gras Poutine is alright, I feel like they could have done so much more with this dish, same with the terrine.   The next time I'm back, I want to try the cured foie gras & boudin tart and the foie gras Duo  My beer recommendations include the Cheval Blanc and Cream Ale. The XXX Milkshake is also a dream, like one of those really willd fantasies that make you keep wanting more.  Chef Martin Picard does wonders with meats and foie. We had duck terrine, duck foie gras cubed, frozen and fried."}
{"text":"Well, finally I get to go to the Holy Grail of Foie Gras.  In a word disappointing.  First I should say I was shockingly able to score a reservation the same day.  On a Saturday night, no less.  So I should be grateful, right?  Uh, no.  We started off with the codfish fritters.  Waaay salty!  Did no one tell them to soak the codfish and change the water.  We then had the cromequis de foie gras which were served with the obligatory warning about waiting for three minutes for them to cool and more importantly to swallow in one bite.  NOT A PROBLEM.   This was the best part of the meal.  We also split a very expensive bottle of ok wine.  We shared the blue cheese and endive salad which was tasty.   The entrees were off the foie Gras menu as I explained to our server that we wanted to eat foie gras till I began to sweat actual duck fat.  I had the Poutine with foie gras, guess I'm not a cheese curd kinda gal. But it had lovely chunks of silken F.G. And for that I say merci!  my darling husband decided on the boudin and FG tartine.  Now all the pictures I've seen of this dish show a honking (pun intended) big block of the good fat.  Not so when our dish arrived...the fat was completely melted into the boudin sausage. Seriously?  I noticed that someone else from jersey was willing to drive seven hours just for this restaurant.  Would u like the address for Dartangan food purveyors?  Make your own!  On a complimentary note the staff was friendly to the point of effervescence.  Well schooled in the craft of serving.  Never to attentive just at your elbow at that crucial moment u might need another glass of wine poured.    Btw slamming kewl tshirt that I will proudly where every chance I get.  Please tell me this isn't the best that Montreal has to offer?"}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place...   We had a reservation for 4 but when we got there we still had to wait for our table. Ok, no biggie. I knew this place would be a challenge for me since i don't really eat strange animal parts etc. Hmm... let's go with the French Onion soup then, since it's my all time favourite soup on the planet. The waiter assured us that everything on the menu was available. But when i got up from the table, and he came to take our order they said no French Onion soup today. Hmm... the bf did his best to order for me since i wasn't there. Steak & frites it is. Sounds good. We also wanted to get the Oreilles de Crisse, but they didn't have that either. Bummer. The waiter took forever to bring our wine, we had to remind him a couple times. When we got the wine it was deeelish! YAY! That made me feel better. I also substituted the frites for mashed potatoes, which i had heard were to die for.  When my meal came the steak was very pink. Ya, i know i know... that's the way you are \"supposed\" to eat a steak. But I like mine a little more brown and a little less dripping with pink ooze. When i asked to get it done a little more they refused, saying the chef won't cook it any more because it ruins the taste. Hmm, i can try to understand that i guess. But really, I'M the one eating it! So, no, i didn't find it delicious. I only ate around the outside. Meh. The potatoes were really good though.   For dessert we ordered Pouding ChÃ´meur. It was okay, but i was glad we shared it between the 4 of us. It was really sweet.  All in all, i could give this place more stars if the service was better, or if maybe they had the food that i wanted. But both left something to be desired... Meh. Too much hype, i was disappointed."}
{"text":"The food tasted delicious going down but I guess I'm not used to heavy, rich creams anymore.  Both my friend and I were sick afterwards.  Nice ambiance, but I will probably not go back."}
{"text":"OMG, the best restauarant ever...  If you love foie gras, this place is it.... Our party was honestly getting sick of it by the end...   foie gras poutin was meh, as the cheese was still hard  foie gras stuffed pigs foot was great... bison tongue: great  Best dish is the foie gras with bacon, maple syrup, egg, and something else... i dont even know the name of the dish, but this was the absolute best dish  great bang for buck appetizer is the guinea hen fowl liver spread...(cheap man's foie gras)"}
{"text":"I want to live here.  In the restaurant of course. I absolutely love this place.  We came here for a pre party stag dinner. It was insane.  Drinks and wine were wonderful. Food was out of this world.  Foie Gras paradise. We had everything Foie Gras. From the night, to the burger, to the pigs leg stuffed with foie. It was rich, heavy, buttery, seasoned perfection. Insane experience. You are getting what you pay for and that is always a great feeling.   I would absolutely recommended. Try it all and ask about specials that's where the magic is."}
{"text":"Based on all the hype I was ready for disappointment, but I was pleasantly surprised. This place is down to earth and just serves tasty food. The service was awesome and and they made wonderful recommendations. The pricing was reasonable all the way around which was another surprise. They had a nice spectrum of prices on wine and reasonable beer prices.   I'm hoping that the red wine I drank can dissolve all the animal fats I consumed as I had a truly decadent meal. We sampled the fois gras poutine which was sinfully delicious, the duck in a can, the pied de cochon and the pudding dessert. Everything was pretty darn good and I would eat it all again in a heart beat! I don't consider myself to be a big carnivore, but I couldn't get enough of this tender succulent meat.   I need to go back to sample the seafood and bison which also looked intriguing. So much to eat and so little time."}
{"text":"A popular spot - we managed to squeeze in without a friday-night reso at 11pm (after waiting or 30 mins).   Very friendly, helpful service, a good atmosphere and amazing food.   I had the melting pot. It's incredibly rich and full of flavour - includes blood sausage, another sausage, pork belly and a puree of some sort (potato I think, but tastier). I actually froze my leftovers and baked them a week later for an indulgent night in with a nice bottle of wine... I highly recommend it ;)  My only grudge was the wait for our food. It's pretty slow.. But that may have been due to the duck in a can my partner ordered, which btw he LOVED too :)"}
{"text":"On our first date, my boyfriend and I were talking about foie gras and about a restaurant in Montreal that made Foie Gras Poutine. I was like \"I know that place-- Au Pied Du Cochon, and I've been dying to go!\" to which he replied \"Okay, let's go!\".  Six months later we were living together and took our first trip together to Montreal. Naturally, Au Pied du Cochon was on our dance card!  Now, the first time we went, the service and food were all great. We had the Foie Gras Croquemensis, the Poutine, Codfish fritters and the Duck in a Can. Admittedly, a heavy meal for the end of July, but we enjoyed. The presentation was stupendous and I couldn't get over how much foie gras was on the poutine!! A nap afterwards is mandatory.  The second time we went this past August, the service was not so hot. Our server wasn't able to explain the menu or specials very well. This skill is more like a necessity at APDC because of the nature of the menu items (many of them contain organs and culinary preparations that are not common to all diners) and also because of the language barrier. Even the English menu has a lot of French on it. So it helps to have a server who is well versed in his culinary terminology and can dole out a few recommendations. sadly, this guy could not. And I really felt bad for him. I'm a server, too, so I know that people have off nights and sometimes things are just crazy and it can be hard to present things well when everything is going haywire around you. He did mean well.   But all was not well in Pig-Land this night...  The food and the presentation of it left much to be desired this time around. The poutine was slopped on the plate with streaks of gravy all over the edge that no one had bothered to wipe and all the food appeared crowded or simply thrown on the plate. Originally, I had ordered the sweetbreads they had on special, but they ran out as soon as my order was placed so I opted for the liver, which was cooked well and delicious. But things just weren't up to the same standard as they were the first time we were there.  I'm still giving then 4 stars for the wonderful time we had before. But taking off one star overall. I know that they can do better. APDC is an iconic place and we made our way there as a happy couple after some first date banter about foie gras. Hopefully, if we go back again, I can add that extra star and make it a 5!"}
{"text":"Every city has an experience unique to its charm. For Montreal, PDC cabane Ã  sucre marks the map for an original excursion whether with family of friends. Being one a demanded event, you have to book this event months in advance-and be nice to your friends who host, if you cancel you pay 50% for your spot. Serious food lovers only! The menu changes annually with a particular theme that is influenced by chef Martin Picard's travels. From years past there was a Japanese influence, this year was Moroccan.   The drive out to Mirabel is a nice one - 45 min drive from the city (car pooling highly recommended) with a views of the farm side. There is plenty of parking. We were there for the 6 pm service so the wait was short. The cabin is minimal in decor buy filled with a sugar shack glow alligned with long wooden tables.   Once we were seated the feasting started. For 70$ per person (w/o tax -with tax, min tip and a beer comes out to over 100$), you will get your money's worth of food and dine like kings and Queen's. I lost count- over 10 courses. You'll get take away containers (honestly I didn't enjoy the food next day - tasted better on spot). The portions were too large for me to actually enjoy each dish separately - but that is unique to the cabane Ã  sucre experience.   There was a cocktail menu with drinks starting at 10$. I settled for a st-ambroise stout to compliment the blend of spice /sweet for 9$- good call because it lasted my whole meal!   There was no particular order of items served- but I do think the foie gras was too sweet be served as a starter (but very good! Needed fancier bread-not toast). For the following courses- I really enjoyed the fish Kefta dish with a blend of avocado, peas, etc. I liked the element of traditional Moroccan cooking styles introduced into the food experience -two dishes a pork, and a beef dish baked in a separate clay pots- swimming in flavour!  For dessert: the simplest of all choices blew my mind - shaved ice with mint liquor and dried mint leaves that came with the traditional maple syrup on a stick. The presentation was beautiful like woods in a winterscape.   A very cool experience as a local. Although I don't know if i will be back - this was a one time thing for me. I think I'm more traditional and will await Picard's apple picking season version of this event."}
{"text":"The food is heavy.   That is the most standout description i can think of. One does not need foie gras on everything.  If you make it into a sashimi with rice ok that is innovative and blends the fatty taste of foie gras with the light sweet taste of rice seasoned with soy sauce and spiced with a touch of wasabi. If it is put on something like a pig leg then it adds fat to the already fat and heavy pigs leg.   The drinks are really good. IIRC there is a maple beer.   I haven't tried everything yet and with restaurants like this the menu items are really hit or miss."}
{"text":"This place is nothing more than a dream come true for fans of well cooked meats and foie gras!  Despite the small walk-through space and single bathroom, you can't go wrong with the tinted lighting, wood and brick walls, and open kitchen concept, making for a very welcoming dining atmosphere.  The food is slightly on the pricey side, with an average dish ranging from $25-37 depending on what you order. But the portions are well worth every dollar. One dish is enough to satisfy a big eater; two dishes will induce food coma. And when you're dealing with meats slow cooked to perfection, marinated with simple yet delicious flavours, and well complimenting sides, it can get very easy to get carried away with wanting to try everything.  I sat down with five other friends, all of us guys and in Montreal for a bachelor party (attention bachelor party planners, this is the perfect place for dinner). They sat us near the open window, which for a warm evening was great. It gave us room to breathe and a good view of the restaurant or of the street depending on where we looked.  After a round of beers, we shared a Boudin Tart and a Duck Carpaccio. The tart crust was light and crispy topped with caramel onion, potato, and blood sausage cooked to perfection. The foie gras drizzle on top made for a light but wonderfully complex marriage of flavours and the dish was shared evenly among us. The Duck Carpaccio went as quickly as it appeared. The thinly sliced pieces of raw duck signified meat of the highest quality and flavour, and it was balanced out with an egg yolk, olive oil, mushrooms, capers, and mushrooms.  The main dishes were equally spectacular. The PDC cut was a roast so big, it had to share it. It was cooked very well. A crispy flavourful exterior with a well done first layer down to a juicy medium rare interior. The veal rib was a massive, single rib with melt off the bone, tender, and astoundingly seasoned meat. My duck magret in mushroom sauce was absolutely spectacular. The sauce was a light white wine flavouring, thinly sliced mushrooms covering thin slices of duck cooked medium rare. With each slice, the flavour of the duck became more noticeable.  Dessert was light, since by this point we were all stuffed. I ordered a maple toffee milkshake. It wasn't big; served in the same glass as our beer. It was a frothy shake, not thick, but it also had a light, non-invasive sweetness. The toffee flavour came from a thick piece of toffee that sat in the shake and could be eaten at any time. It was a satisfying end to a satisfying meal.  The star lost was mainly due to the poor service we got from the main waitress. The bus boy was fantastic. He promptly refilled our water and got us more bread than we could stomach. The runner was equally pleasant. But the main waitress had a bit of attitude from her greeting, was not helpful in any way, and never came back to check on us. If it weren't for her assisted helpers, we would have had no interaction with any staff. Also, we were warned that the PDC cut would take 50 minutes to prepare, but after an hour of waiting, no one came with an update. I can see how this would have turned off tourists from recommending the place, or from wrecking the dining experience.  However, Au Pied de Cochon has quickly become a go to place whenever I'm in Montreal. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, and when you talk about value, I wouldn't have been angry if the prices were even higher than they are considering the quality. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We were here on a Friday night and we were one of the first to arrive as soon as their dinner service started. We had the foie gras croquettes which we loved. It had a warm melted foie gras concuction inside a crisp outer shell. Delicious! I had the Ploque a Champlain which was an appetizer that i had as my main course. It was buckwheat pancake, ham, cheese, foie gras drizzled with maple syrup. I was very disappointed as it was coyingly sweet for me. It was drowning in sweet sauce and the pancake soaked even more of the sweet syrup. I had to ask for a separate plate to transfer my food away from the pool of sauce. Looking back I should've complained. My husband had the halibut with scallops which was good but also drowning in sauce. We had a drink each and no dessert and our bill with tip was around $150. The experience wasn't great for me that night....there was too much noise... servers rushed here and there. It felt chaotic even with a few diners at the beginning of service."}
{"text":"Mon mari et moi avons Ã©tÃ© assez chanceux pour obtenir une rÃ©servation pour deux Ã  la Cabane Ã  sucre Au pied de cochon. Nous avions trÃ¨s hÃ¢te d'y aller et nous n'avons certainement pas Ã©tÃ© dÃ©Ã§us. Durant notre visite, nous Ã©tions assis au bar, et nous avons donc reÃ§u un service privilÃ©giÃ© de la barmaid. Comme le menu Ã©tait trÃ¨s long, je ne ferai qu'une critique gÃ©nÃ©rale de l'endroit plutÃ´t que de me lancer dans la description de chacun des services.   D'abord, la Cabane Ã  sucre Au pied de cochon est une expÃ©rience culinaire en soi qui vaut la peine d'Ãªtre vÃ©cue. Ensuite, si vous trouviez le restaurant montrÃ©alais extravagant, sachez que sa cabane Ã  sucre est pantagruÃ©lique: on mangeait moins dans les antiques orgies romaines, j'en suis certain! L'amabilitÃ© (et le grand esthÃ©tisme) des gens au service se doit d'Ãªtre soulignÃ© Ã  deux traits, mÃªme si certains font preuve d'un lÃ©ger manque d'expÃ©rience et de maÃ®trise du menu. L'inventivitÃ© du chef exÃ©cutif, Vincent Dion LavallÃ©e, se doit aussi d'Ãªtre reconnue, mÃªme si son jeune Ã¢ge lui fait crÃ©er certains plats qui vont dans beaucoup trop de directions simultanÃ©ment.   Si vous avez l'opportunitÃ© d'y aller, voici nos conseils et rremarques: le menu est fixe, vous n'avez pas de choix Ã  faire et vous mangez ce qu'on vous sert; allez-y avec un grand groupe de gens trÃ¨s gourmands (voire carrÃ©ment cochons); prÃ©parez-vous mentalement Ã  manger comme vous n'avez jamais mangÃ© auparavant (tant en quantitÃ©, qu'en valeur calorique, qu'en qualitÃ©); amenez-vous une grand glaciÃ¨re pour rapporter vos restes chez vous (car oui c'est la pratique Ã©tablie: tout ce que vous ne mangez pas, vous le mettez en doggy-bag et le ramenez chez vous); prÃ©voyez 62$ par personne plus de l'extra si vous voulez qu'on vous serve la tourtiÃ¨re et aussi pour acheter les charcuteries et confiseries Ã  apporter Ã  la maison.   Pour finir, voici le menu qui nous Ã©tÃ© servi ce soir lÃ  suivi de mon apprÃ©ciation de chaque plat sur cinq Ã©toiles (cinq Ã©tant miam et un Ã©tant beurk):   EntrÃ©es CanapÃ© de foie gras, fÃ¨ves au lard, oreilles de Christ ***** Omelette soufflÃ©e, ragoÃ»t de tripes de boeuf et jambon, polenta frite **** Quenelle d'esturgeon, sauce aux moules ***** GÃ¢teau de saumon et mousseline de lÃ©gumes *** Oeufs dans le sirop **   \" Entremet \" Jambon au foin, beignets frits au gras de canard *   Plats principaux Magret de canard farci de ses chairs confites, sauce aux poivrons rouge, polenta crÃ©meuse ** PÃ¢tes Ã  l'encre de seiche et sang de cochon, sauce Ã  la farce de tourtiÃ¨re et boudin ***** Patate sucrÃ©e Ã  la guimauve Ã  l'Ã©rable ****   Desserts Tartelette Ã  la banane, meringue flambÃ©e Ã  l'Ã©rable **** Yogourt glacÃ© Ã  l'Ã©rable et liquer d'Ã©rable *** Tire d'Ã©rable sur neige ***** \" Mokabane \" (gÃ¢teau moka Ã  l'Ã©rable) *****"}

{"text":"God bless this place and its affinity for serving you things with the head still on or in cans. On our first visit I was obsessing over the Duck in a Can, which didn't disappoint...I had cold sweats everyday for two weeks after, needing my fix.   The Foie Gras poutine is something I've been actively campaigning to get in every restaurant in the US or at least our immediate area, but unfortunately, I can't get any of these dicks on board.   Our second trip, my boyfriend and I ordered the Guinea Hen to share. After the heart stopping experience I had; unknowingly moving the whole head still casually attached to the bird, we dug into what would be one of the most delicious things we will ever eat. Thank god they give you a side I extra gravy, the giant pool of it at the bottom of the 8 quart La Crouset pan probably wouldn't do.     If I lived in Montreal I would be outside this place everyday selling myself for poutine and sugar pie."}
{"text":"Best foie gras dishes you'll find anywhere. If you're in montreal, don't miss this place."}
{"text":"This is a fun experience to eat in this cute old establishment. We had the pig head to share, unfortunately it was too hard to eat(it was deeply fried). But still I consider it as a interesting experience."}
{"text":"I love foie gras so PDC is probably as close to heaven as I will get.  It's so good, we ate here twice during a three night stay in Montreal.  It would have been three days in a row but my arteries needed to rest a day in between.  The mains were solid ,but it's the foie that stands out.  Favorite was the cold foie served with crackers.  We also had it seared with apples, as a tart, and of course in the poutine - all were excellent.   The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is warm and inviting, the kind of place I would love to be able to visit a few times a week if it were not for the 5700 mile commute."}
{"text":"I can't say much that hasn't already been said.  There were 7 adults in our party and I made sure to have at least one bite of everything that came to the table.  In a nutshell... everything was decadent, rich and delicious.  There weren't many plates (appetizer or main course) that came to the table without some pork &/or foie gras on it.  For appetizers we had the foie gras \"tout nu\" - a traditional serving of foie gras on crostini with a balsamic glaze, fried squash blossoms served with aioli, onion soup gratinee - I don't believe there was a single bite without cheese, the cochonailles platter - essentially a charcuterie plate comprised completely of pork products, and the tarragon bison tongue - which was tender and flavorful.  Based on all other rave reviews, one member of our party ordered the Duck in a Can... yum.  Other entrees included the ridiculously large portioned foie gras burger - aka heart attack on a bun, lamb shank - the only entree complaint came from the bland hot tomatoes on top of the dish, meatloaf - topped with a generously sized piece of foie gras, steak frites, halibut special of the day, and the PDC melting pot.  Next time we find ourselves in Montreal, we'd be hard pressed to pick an alternative to Au Pied De Cochon.  It was well worth the trip."}
{"text":"\"Au Pied De Cochon\" means \"at the pig's foot,\" and they're known for their huge roasted pork leg dishes, but Chef Martin Picard should change the restaurant's name to something more appropriate. \"At the Fountain of Foie Gras\" or \"At the Teats of Heaven.\" Well, they don't serve teats I think, but they do serve Christ's Ears -- \"oreilles de Christ,\" a Quebecker sugar shack favorite of deep fried pork rinds smothered with maple syrup. PDC serves Quebecker food. Not French, not Canadian -- Quebecker. If all Quebecker food were as good as PDC fare, I would quickly die a very plump, very happy man.  Plogue a Champlain. It deserves its own review. Calisse de crisse, this dish is mindblowing! Dessert? Breakfast? Appetizer? Entree?  I'll describe. Take half a lobe of fresh foie gras and pan sear it so that the outside is crusty, while the inside is still moist and springs back to the touch. Stack it atop brie, atop shredded potatoes, atop a buckwheat pancake garnished with two strips of locally grown bacon. Smother generously with real maple syrup. Put the dish in a fiery hot brick oven until you can't stand the wait anymore. Take it out. Take a bite. Now devour the rest. Okay, you can die now.  The plogue alone is worth five stars. It's the best thing I've ever eaten. And I've had it many times since my life-changing first. I could stop at the plogue and never touch another menu item. But wait -- there's more! PDC's brick oven-baked pork chops with rosemary and white wine are the best pork chops I've ever had. I ordered the one-pounder (500g) thinking it would be far too much. To my deep regret, it was so good, I wish I had ordered their 2-pound (1kg) cut. More than enough meat for any man. But wait -- there's more! We haven't even touch the pig's foot!  Yes, pork trotter -- pig's foot. Stuffed, braised, baked. It's amazingly, succulently, stupendously supple and tender and tasty. And it comes with or without foie gras stuffing. You can get foie gras with anything. You can get it atop poutines -- Quebec's quintessential dish of squeeky fresh cheese curds and fries drowned in hot gravy. You can get it by itself. You can try it for yourself. You can have foie gras and hams, Sam-I-Am.  Every ingredient is from a local farmer. Everything is hand-made -- they even brew their own PDC beer. Every time I've gone, every person working there has been beyond gracious. Everything I've said above is why Au Pied De Cochon has been a smashing success since its opening in 2001. Make reservations, folks. I doubt they ever run out of pig's foots, but I know they run out of seating every night.  PDC is world class. If the exchange rate weren't so hellish, I'd be there now, enjoying the marvelous Montreal summer and PDC -- the second best thing about Montreal.  P.S. Please, please don't bring your vegetarian friends unless I'm there to laugh. =) Says Picard, \"When you go to a restaurant to eat salad, you have a problem.\"  P.P.S. #1? Les copines. ;)"}
{"text":"Belated review visited July 2014 The good For the price point, crazy big portions of food.  The bad Super loud. I actually have never been in such a loud place. Even though we were at a tiny table felt like to hear each other we needed mega phones.Super cramped. Food despite the hype was not very impressive. We had the much written about roast pork head with lobster. Lobster fishy un fresh. Pork under seasoned though perfectly tender and cooked. Was such a waste of excellent  meat as pork was super quality and beautifully cooked with crispy skin. We tried fois gras tart ... For anyone who reveres fois as much as I do was super sad. Granted we ate late 9 pm and were among last patrons but everything tastes NOT freshly made and tired. I really cannot understand the positive reviews. Perhaps we had a super off night but at this price point a restaurant needs better quality control.  Overall not a destination place. As a neighborhood spot maybe try. But we sampled enough of the menu favorites to be certain there are no stars."}
{"text":"Before dinner at PDC, I did not believe the term \" too much foie gras\"   Our 1st dish was Foie Gras with bacon and fig (a special that night which I thought was only a small appetizer, but it was actually an entry size dish). The foie gras were perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth, but the fig was a little too strong and made the entire dish a bit too sweet.  By the end of the 1st dish, I was already pretty satisfied. And then our main course came:  Mine was Cured Foie Gras & Boudin Tart (how big can a tart be? right? wrong!! this is not your regular tart,  it is meant to be shared by 4 very hungry people!!).  This dish was probably, by far,  the richest food I have ever had in my entire life!! With tons of Foie Gras AND blood sausages on a huge tart.  Although the dish tasted really great, I could only finish 1/6 of the \"pie\" and I felt... defeated.. by FOIE GRAS?!   My husband ordered duck in the can which comes in a regular can, but I was surprised how much duck and foie gras were packed in that can.  Unfortunately, he was defeated too, left half of the foie gras and duck untouched. The duck, in my opinion, was bland. I did not try his foie gras though (obviously)...  We also ordered the duck fat fries, they tasted just like the regular fries.   For dessert, we ordered the Lemon Meringue Pie and Panna Cotta, the panna cotta was outstanding, pie was just all right.   We will definitely return, and next time PDC, we  - will- be - prepared!"}
{"text":"If you love foie gras and you are in Montreal you have to come to this place. They have a foie gras section on the menu!! Far from a gimmick, everything is expertly and artfully prepared and the vibe of the restaurant is energetic, with an open kitchen.  I came here a year ago and saw there was a draft sitting in Yelp and it wouldn't let me delete it, so I thought I might as well write a quick review. They had this giant, delicious sugar pie for dessert and I only wish I had saved some more room to enjoy more of it."}
{"text":"Fries and foie gras.   You typically would not find these two things in the same sentence, much less the same dish. The culinary equivalent of the Prince and the Pauper. But Pied de Cochon decides to break status quo and do it anyway. What a rebel.   The Foie Gras Poutine is a fancy version of Canada's beloved comfort food. Palate pleasing, yet a little underwhelming. How so? It's as if a waiter holding a foie gras dish and a waiter holding a plate of fries ran smack into each other and attempted to pull of the resulting haphazard combination as a new creation. The fries just physically don't go together with the chunks of foie gras.  What I did do was eat them separately. The fries & cheese curds drenched in the sauce was fantastic. The foie gras itself in the sauce was amazing.   I guess maybe I shouldn't complain since I got two dishes out of one. More bang for the buck.   Fries. Foie gras.  ^ That's more accurate.   PS - If I could, I would minus 928374927348234 stars for how inconvenient it is to find parking. Had to park illegally a ways away, run in & order, run out and wait in the car, run back to pick up my order, then run back to my car. True story.   Me: 1 Parking maid: 0"}
{"text":"Absolutely miserable experience.  My wife and I are foodies from NYC who heard a lot about this place and read all of the great reviews.  Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed.  10:30 reservation and sat at 11pm (get your schedule straight)  Ordered a bottle of wine and 2 dishes.  Pasta dish first was pretty good.  Then watched our \"duck in a can\" sit on the shelf for a half hour before the waiter brought it over-honestly no thanks.  They charged us for the wine only which was appreciated, but would have rather paid whatever to have a good experience.  Glad our hotel has quality room service.  O well I guess you win some/ lose some.  We will never return."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of arriving for my 11PM reservation with a hangover, so I didn't quite get to enjoy the full excellence. Seating was very cramped, but in full view of the kitchen, which made the experience much more enjoyable. Food was good, but expect to spend $$$.   Oh, and make reservations EARLY. The night before my reservation someone offered me $500 for it, so that's a good indication of the popularity of the place."}
{"text":"Je suis franchement impressionnÃ©e. Le service est ultra rapide, l'ambiance est festive. La poutine au foie gras et le beigne fourrÃ© Ã  la crÃ¨me cassonade Ã©taient franchement bons.  Je suis aussi trÃ¨s surprise du rapport qualitÃ©/prix.  La poutine Ã©tait Ã  8.75 pour une bonne portion. D'autres camions offrent des poutines plus petites Ã  un prix plus Ã©levÃ©, sans foie gras...  HonnÃªtement, si vous devez essayer qu'un seul camion de rue, gÃ¢tez-vous, prenez le Camion au pied de cochon, le service est impeccable, l'ambiance festive, une vraie fÃªte"}
{"text":"I don't know what else to say except that everything about my experience here was the tops. Cocktail: whiskey maple yum. Meal: a big bowl-o-meats (sausages) with the best gravy and potato combo that I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  I wish I lived closer to Montreal so I could eat here every year for my birthday. (So somebody else could foot the bill of course).  I recommend it to everyone I know that is going to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Probable the only reason i move to Montreal. Have no words to explain how delicious food is here."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened, but the meal took 3 hours. 15 min to order, 15 min to get apps, then a 2 hour wait until we got our entrees. and we ate in 30 min and left. Our reservation was 10 PM. we finished past 1 AM.  Everything was overly salted Fois gras poutine was amazing. The fois gras was so sweet and fatty. amazing Salted fish poutine with squid ink instead of gravy -eh. Combination of weird ingredients over fries that don't really complement it Hot chicken -waaaaaay too salty Beef Tongue -really good. Also paired with a vinegary veggie which made it super yummy. Very tender Blood sausage -eh, but the mashed potatoes are SOOOOOOO good. Its cheesy mashed potatoes, so cheesy that the whole consistency is stringy. Really really yummy Everything was fine, except we waited 2 HOURS in between our apps and food. meanwhile tables seated after us, at 12 AM, got their food all within 30 minutes. Maybe they lost our order? but no really apology. unacceptable"}
{"text":"Can't be topped.  We had a reservation for the bar and that made the experience. We sat right in front of the open kitchen and the head chef interacted all night. Watching their work being created is a truly unique and wonderful experience. It made you appreciate your food just that much better.   Amazing service and understanding of those who don't speak French. The staff was very attentive and walked us through the entire menu along with the specials of the evening. Presentation and atmosphere is beautiful. The service you receive is as important as your meal, especially when traveling from out of town and having essentially one shot to make a lasting impression.   Come with an appetite!  The portions are large, I struggled to finish my plate and I'm no small guy.  Cod fritters to start were on point, delicate and not too heavy with a nice hint of spice at the end.  Duck in a Can... Yes! Amazing.  Presentation of this dish was lovely.    Desert: the name (in French escapes me) but it was like a sponge cake with butter, sugar, and of course maple syrup.   A+"}
{"text":"Un peu cher, avouons le mais l'endroit vaut le dÃ©tour.  Des bonnes portions gÃ©nÃ©reuses, un service impeccable. On ne sent pas pressÃ©, j'aime beaucoup!"}
{"text":"If you are foie gra person, you will probably love this place. However, i am not a foie gra person, so everything here was too heavy for me. It was really heavy and oily. And the seating is tinny and narrow. if you expect a fine dining experience, you better go try something else. Their portion was actually huge. For two girls, i will recommend you to share a appetizer and a main."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza I have ever had in my 23 years - the foie gras pizza. Amazing service.   Au Pied de Cochon isn't a pretentious place, despite it's reputation - it always has people lingering outside on the sidewalk in the summer and the waiters are really friendly and professional. Make reservations well in advance."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for food to come after we were seated.  EXTREMELY slow service.  They were trying to appease tables with shots but did not bring to our table because we had a 10 and 14 year old with us. Pigs head for two is ALL fat.  Very little meat and not worth $80.  Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Ok this review is about 7 months late, but I still remember it like it was yesterday. The Boy had taken me to Mont Tremblant for a skiing trip for my belated Graduation present and Christmas present. On our trip, we stayed in Montreal our first night across the border. I had read many times over on websites that this place was the place to go for great Canadian-French cuisine so I thought this was the perfect place to try my first authentic French meal. Boy, they were not lying! I'll admit I did not know really anything about French food prior to this trip so I asked the waitress for her recommendations which she gladly gave in her thick French accent. We started off with the cromesquis with foie gras appetizer which is basically this tiny pastry thingy filled with hot, liquid foie gras that explodes in your mouth. It exploded so well that I think some of it came out of my boyfriends mouth, oh! We also ordered an appetizer of marinated smoked sausages that Boy just had to try. Next, for our main course we split the infamous \"Duck in a Can\" entree as well as the Beef tartar with a side of fries cooked in duck fat! The tartar was great but the duck was PHENOMENAL. Even though I am pretty sure I contributed heavily to my LDL count in this one meal, I must say that it is one of the most delicious and mind blowing food experiences I've ever had! It has opened me up to the world of French cuisine! I can't wait to eat here again when I come back for another skiing trip. It was my favorite meal the entire time I was in Canada. If you're ever in Montreal, do not miss the opportunity to have a food revelation like I did at this neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Au Pied De Cochon isn't for the faint or weak. Not for the faint of stomach (think duck fat and pork), faint of heart (think duck fat, pork and your arteries) nor the faint of wallet (think duck fat, pork and a  reputable name that costs money to even utter).  Call in your reservation weeks, even a month or so in advance. This is no walk-in spot.   Please do not bring your squeamish friends here as they will not enjoy the experience, and you may not either. Also, do eat lightly the day of because this meal will consume and overtake your body, and also that part of your brain that controls  food comas.   Our reservation was called in a couple of weeks in advance, and we got an 11pm block on a friday night.  We arrived and were seated immediately.  The restaurant itself isn't cabaret. No flashing lights or people in pig costumes. It blends with the surrounding establishments on its block, ninja-like if you aren't keeping a good look out. The ambiance is actually very casual, and upbeat.   Oh and their piggy icon is very symbolic of this spot, a little bit comical, a lot fatty.  We wanted to sample a lot of different things: two orders of the foie gras poutine, the infamous duck in a can, pied de cochon stuffed with foie gras, boudin maison, and cÃ´te de cochon heureux.  The foie gras poutine was heaven on a plate. With every bite, I could hear angels trumpeting behind me. I scooped up the last bit of it with our complimentary bread. Never knew I could fall in love with something so alien to me.   Duck in a can! Literally. It's quite a sight and very photo/vid worthy to catch them serving this up to you. Taste-wise, the amount of duck fat in there would make a roll of papertowels run away, but it ridiculously succulent.  Stuffed pied de cochon swims underneath a rich, glorious brown gravy, if you're lucky, you'll find some semi crispy skin under there. I know I did. Boudin maison was a delectable porky tenderness as well, probably the more conservative of the dishes.   Wasn't a fan the last dish on our list because there was just way too much blood sausage, which I have never been a fan of.   To cap this artery-clogging feast, and about 1:30 am,  we got brazilian coffee. Hot, creamy and liquor-y.  Unforgettable experience best saved for the brave."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening and this place did not disappoint. Came with my husband, brother and sister in law and we decided to order a bunch of dishes to share. We tried the tartar temaki, French onion soup, plogue a Champlain, duck in a can, poutine and cured foie grad & boudin tart.   My two favourite dishes were the tartar temaki and plogue a champlain. The temaki was so fresh with the crispy seaweed and creamy from the quail egg on top. Everything about this hand roll was delish! The plogue a champlain was a buckwheat pancake with potato, bacon, cheese and foie gras drizzeled with what I think was a maple syrup of some sort. The flavours of everything mingled so well together. The bacon was to die for and obviously the foie gras was delicious. I would come here and order this again.   The infamous duck in a can to me was a little overwhelming. About two bites in and I couldn't eat a whole lot more. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but oh so heavy. This is definitely something I would recommend to share amongst at least 4 people. The plate started with a crouton and some purÃ©e and then the can was emptied on top. Inside the can they had cooked foie gras, a slice of duck, a giant slab of fat and a bunch of cabbage and veggies in a gravy. It was an explosion of flavours, but a bit too high in cholesterol for me.   I wasn't impressed with the French onion soup, poutine or the tart, but my sister in law loved it. To me the flavours of each were too rich and heavy, but not in a good way.   The service was excellent and the atmosphere was pretty casual. I would definitely be back to try some other foie gras dishes."}
{"text":"First let me say that this restaurant glorifies food, in particular pork, foie gras and maple syrup in ways that can best be called food porn. It is excessive, extravagant, undeniably delicious and incredibly satisfying. The ambience is kind of modern bistro, with plenty of noise, activity and young staff. But don't let that put you off, because the food is so worth it. We started off with the French onion soup - the only disappointment of the night. Too much bread and the small amount of broth was weak and lacked depth. Things improved vastly with the duck tart which was incredible! Perfect golden brown pastry with a duck confit filling, topped with a foie gras sauce. I could barely refrain from licking the plate, it was that good. Then we had the asparagus special, served over duck carpaccio and topped with a morel sauce and shaved parmesan - in a word, fantastic! Next up was the duck breast topped with the oyster mushrooms and fiddlegreens served over potatoes fried in duck fat. It sounds excessive, and it was, but oh my, it was unbelievably delicious. One of the best duck dishes I have had in my life. By this point all that rich food and wine was beginning to take it's toll, so we opted for the chocolate molten cake - somewhat more conventional, but really well done and just as rich and decadent as one could hope for. Did I enjoy this meal? Heck yeah! Will I be back? As soon as I can!"}
{"text":"This place made going to Montreal during Winter totally worth it!   1. Make reservations! Even with reservations, it's still a 30 minute wait. It's small and people take their time enjoying the food and atmosphere 2. My favorite dish was the foie gras terrine...I am a sucker for some fatty spread on delicious bread! 3. Order any variety of tongue they have (pickled etc)...for a shocking $4 dollars it's a pretty big serving size and tastes absolutely delicious! 4. Duck in can...I was shocked when they literally brought the can out and poured out the duck and liver. This is a VERY rich dish and I suggest you splitting everything so you get a little bit of everything. This was so delicious I am drooling thinking about it! 5. Skip the desserts...totally not worth it but everything else was so good I'll forgive them for this mistake!  The person next to us ordered the pigs head...it was totally lord of the flies style with a knife through the pigs head. Served with oysters and mashed potatoes, I could not stop staring at the two guys tearing into this head."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a visit if you're ever in Montreal. It's a nice looking restaurant, with a very busy feel to it. Made dinner reservations 2 weeks in advance, just to be safe.   For appetizers, started out with the Cromesquis de foie gras, pork rinds, and a bone marrow dish.   The cromesquis were absolutely amazing, and a great way to start off the dinner. Small cubes of deep fried foie gras that just melts in your mouth, washing your mouth over with fatty deliciousness. The pork rinds were fried deliciously, but isn't hard to mess up pork rinds. The bone marrow dish was probably my favorite, as I am a big fan of bone marrow, and this dish was crafted perfectly. It wasn't overwhelmingly rich, but the perfect amount of flavor and sauce that I soaked up with some bread.  The entrees were the PDC pork cut, and the namesake stuffed pied de cochon. The pied de cochon was quite a large dish, and I would recommend not ordering it for one (unless you plan on taking it home). The PDC cut of pork was the thickest cut of pork I've ever had, and it was cooked perfectly all the way through, which I thought was an amazing feat. In terms of how it looked, it was pretty much a large cut of pork surrounded by various vegetables and rich sauce. The stuffed pied de cochon was another matter, it looked almost menacing to eat. The foie gras on top, inviting you to try and even attempt conquering the meal. It was indeed a very very rich dish, with mashed potatoes on the bottom that felt like a meal on it's own.   Unfortunately my companion and I were too stuffed to even attempt desserts, so I can't comment on that. All in all though, it was a very enjoyable meal and I will definitely return to try desserts. It's not a restaurant you eat at often, only once in awhile when you get that craving for some delicious foie gras."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the whole world, well maybe El Brigado in BA but I digress.    Seriously, duck in a can? Duck Liver for 15 (just joking)  All kinds of glorious pig dishes and sausages...and duck... oh sweet Jesus. This place is unashamedly a celebration of guilty pleasure food.    Wicked staff and service is great, food that makes you cry it's so good.. should I carry on?  Go here.   Get here early, make a reservation. Don't eat all day prior.. bask in the glory of heart attack food and know you will be probably be too full for romance afterwards..  Maybe cut the food with a couple of bottles of wine.  Best restaurant, every school kid should be taught about Pied as part of their syllabus. Landmark, legend.  We go to Montreal just to eat here."}
{"text":"Great food including foie gras + great French wines = Great experience  Recall the scene and dishes from an Anthony Bourdain episode on Montreal.  Then saw the Chef Owner sitting there dining.  Always a good sign if the owner is dining at his own restaurant."}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon (the pigs feet) is one of Montreal's signature eating establishments alongside Joe Beef.  With a heavy emphasis on meat products, especially foie gras, it's popular with locals and tourists alike.  Reservations are recommended, which we did, but they were extremely accommodating when we stopped by very early and decided to change our original much later reservation.   Walking by the street, I almost missed the restaurant as there's only a menu posted outside and not much signage, but go where everyone is dining and you'll be at the right shop.  The interior is modern and clean with friendly wait staff and a nice bar area with seating as well. The ambiance is noisy with conversations while quick food service keeps the mood fun and enjoyable.  The menu is straightforward with appetizers, main entrees, and dessert listed on a single page with an entire section devoted to foie Gras.  Everything sounds delicious and the waiter was happy to explain anything we didn't know as well as the handful of daily specials.  Our order:  Maple Foie Gras Comesquis - $8.  What a great start with these bite sized appetizers of deep fried dough around molten foie Gras. Served quite hot, you simply pop them into your mouth and enjoy the explosion of richness and flavor.  Mmmmm.  Onion Soup - $15.  I'd been craving a excellent rendition of this French classic and Au Pied delivered.  It's covered with melted cheese but has plentiful rich and savory broth that includes onions but also another unique spin with delicious pieces of aged ham that add both flavor and meatiness to this great soup.  So good and perfect for sharing.    Carpaccio - $16.  You see this dish at many places but the uniqueness here is that the meat of choice is duck meat.  Rare pieces of thinly sliced duck meat are served on a generous platter with thin slices of cheese and a single perfectly poached egg yolk that you break and spread over the carpaccio.  Delicious and a nice contrast to the richer items on the menu.   Tartare Tataki - $15. I almost didn't order this but am so glad I did.  It's literally a hand roll served with their choice of Tartare and a quail egg that you pour on top.  Our evening it was horse Tartare and you're either in or out when it comes to horse meat (and most Montreal residents are in) and after my delicious horse entree at Joe Beef, I was in.  It was delicious with a beefy Tartare that is as good as any hand roll I've had.  Delicious.   Plogue a Champlain - $31.  Alongside the foie Gras Poutine, this is one of Au Pied de Cochon's signature foie gras dishes.  Since I was all \"poutines out\", this dish was a perfect choice for us.  It's a pancake, covered in pig lard, and topped with a huge piece of cooked foie Gras and maple syrup.  The French description admittedly sounds more appetizing than the description but it's a delicious mix of savory and sweet with rich and starchy.  After a few bites, I quickly began to feel satiated.   Duck In a Can - $44. After so many delicious starters, ordering an entree clearly put us over the top but how could we come without ordering this signature dish.  The dish is exactly as described.  A duck leg combined with foie gras, bacon, cabbage and spices is literally canned and heated in the can to be dumped on top of a plate of purÃ©ed butternut squash and two baguette slices.  The amazing thing is that you'd expect something to be either overcooked or undercooked but everything, and I mean everything, comes out perfectly.  The duck was medium rare and well flavored.  The foie Gras was cooked and soft as nicely as the other Plogue dish.  The cabbage and bacon were hearty and mixed well with all the juices from both.  This dish is great for sharing and even-so is pure gluttony.  Very unique, very good and very memorable.   Overall, I'm so happy to have stopped by Au Pied De Cochon.  I left ecstatic and satiated on the buzz of the great cocktails but also the richness of the food.  All the dishes were so unique yet consistent and well done.  I'm not sure I'll eat foie Gras again this year but I'm happy to have spent my yearly (lifetime?) quota here.  Thank you Au Pied de Cochon, especially for accommodating our earlier dinner time.  I slept very well.   Au Pied de Cochon accepts credit cards including Amex."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on the Sunday. It was the western version of Chinese Dim Sum. However, this was one of the more expensive brunches, I've tried.  Servers came by with different types of dishes, and if you want it they will tick off the box on your piece of paper. At the end of the meal you pay for the dishes you ordered. This is good because you get to see the dish before you eat it. The bad thing is that someone else might get it before you do. We managed to snag the last table in the corner before it got really busy. However, because we were in the corner a lot of the dishes were taken before it got to us :(. The food server was good in making sure that we got some dishes. The waiter was friendly and checked in on us. The only bad thing about the service, was in the end there was a delay in getting the bill as he seemed to get a bit frazzled, because it was so busy.   We tried several different dishes. My favourite dish was the foie grois potato, with pork. This was delicious! Very different from anything I've tried before. The foie grois nicely complemented the potato. I just wish there was more of it! Yum.... The maple gnocchi was interesting a little on the sweet side for me but the gnocchi itself had a great texture it was light and fluffy. The french toast was good, but not as good as some of the other dishes. The only dish that I didn't enjoy was the blini. The almond croissant was amazing; flaky, buttery, and had great almond taste. Get it this if you like almond croissants. There is a person that comes by with a cart with different baked desserts, cake, fruit and melted chocolate, and shakes if you so desire.   I was sad that I didn't get to try to sticky ribs, which I was really looking forward to. Other people looked like they really enjoyed it. Next time I'm in Montreal for brunch on a Sun I will be stopping by here."}
{"text":"We did not have a reservation, but they sat us at the bar anyway. We had our 4 year old with us and because it was early they let all 3 of us sit at the bar which was very nice.  The food was tremendous. The people were very nice. Total YES recommendation! Make a reservation to lower your stress and get some foie gras!"}
{"text":"HOLY COW!!... i mean pig!  If you love any part of a pig including the head, make sure you make early reservation to this place.  The foie gras poutine was so decadent but so good!! Pickled tongue...sounds strange but don't knock it til you try it.  Worthy entrees include duck in a can, the pork shoulder and the stuffed pig's foot! No vegetables served at this establishment..."}
{"text":"I have been coming to APC since 2005 and every year we make our food pilgrimage to APC and every year it does not disappoint.  We are foodies that would drive 7 hours from nyc just for the weekend to eat and why not, for the price and the quality of food Montreal is it.  About two years ago we have decided to let the manager Florent to do the ordering for us.  I always have a posse of 6 or more people joining me as these portion are made to share and what an awesome time we all have.  Many of us go into food coma afterwards but since we have prepare for this very 6 months this is what we came for.  This is the place that gets better and better every year!!!! I cannot say enough about it.  The service, the food and even the loud atmosphere, I love all of it!! Everyone who I brought to this place is now a convert! Out of all the good restaurants in Montreal this is the best hands down but the only other place can beat this place is their Sugar Shack.  We have been lucky enough to score reservations for a few years now and yeah that place is better than this place but it is like comparing apples and oranges.  Anyway if I can give more stars this place would be it!!!"}

Had we ordered this alone it'd have been enough. Just to clarify, it's a stuffed pigs foot with a slice of foie gras on top. I thought it'd be stuffed with foie gras but it wasn't. This was probably the best dish. $45  Everything was good but not Amazing. What made it 5 stars was the creativity and quality of the food, you really can't get this anywhere else. As well it's a good deal for what it is, not expensive at all. Definitely come hungry because you'll leave stuffed and ready for a long nap."}
{"text":"Cuisine trÃ¨s riche et gÃ©nÃ©reuse. On peut en sortir avec une indigestion tellement on y mange car c'est trop bon (et gras). l'dÃ©al est de prendre 3 entrÃ©es Ã  2 (ou 3) avec une plat principal et des desserts vu la taille des plats principaux."}
{"text":"Finally a better outlet for their foie gras poutine than its destination restaurant, APDC's poutine is priced just right at $8 per portion. I've had orange-gravy-shredded-mozz poutines for more than $8.   Not typically being a fan of fancy poutine, the (large amount of) foie gras complemented well the noticeable saltiness of the gravy. The presentation was great, easily one of my favorite fancy poutines ever - not that I'd have it every day.   ** Seriously, who reviews a food truck called Au Pied the Cochon for its bottle water price? Next, go review airplanes bathrooms for the comfort of their seats."}

{"text":"This was one of the best restaurants I went to in Montreal, way better than the more highly rated joe beef. The duck in a can was such a cool idea but it was a little too oily even for me. I really liked the french sausage recommended by the waitress I think it was called audiolle? Made of pig intestine"}
{"text":"It's been 2 days and I'm still thinking about the Duck in a Can. I'm not a foodie and was expecting this place to be indistinguishably decent (as I'd categorize most meals over $45), but I am so glad my coworkers insisted on coming. The Pied de Cochon was also great, with the skin and the syrupy sauce and the soft tendon barely holding the bones together. Not so much into the beef shoulder special we ordered, that I would actually drop into the \"just ok\" bucket.  Don't plan on doing much after, you'll want to go home and take a long nap."}

I should've listened, and I apologize for not caring about how you felt.   Sometimes it's hard to keep from going Tasmanian-Devil-food-tornado crazy when they plop a dinner plate-sized, gravy-slathered Yorkshire-style pork chop in front of you, you know? But yes, I admit that I was entirely at fault for the fiasco and I'll never forget your feelings again.  And I'm sorry about the foie gras poutine, the pork rinds, and the foie gras burger too, okay? Are you there? Pick uupppppppppp.  ...  Fine. See if i care.  *CLICK*"}

The kitchen is so interesting to watch, Michelle at the bar was very sweet and nice to talk to, and the food was amazing. I ended up going back again!

Certains plats m'ont dÃ©finitivement fait sortir de ma zone de confort (du genre les dites tripes), mais tant qu'Ã  y Ãªtre, il faut essayer. En plus, c'est tellement bien cuisinÃ© (et noyÃ© dans le sirop d'Ã©rable) que c'est probablement la meilleure faÃ§on de se lancer!  Il n'y a pas de menu, vous mangez ce qu'on vous sert. Les tables sont de grandes tables de 12 personnes, c'est donc idÃ©al si vous Ãªtes un groupe. Le prix de base est de 62$ par personne, c'est donc pas donnÃ© et il faut vraiment apprÃ©cier quelques trucs:  1. Manger. Beaucoup. 2. La viande. 3. Le gras  On ne parle vraiment pas ici d'une cabane Ã  sucre ordinaire, au risque de me rÃ©pÃ©ter. J'ai beaucoup aimÃ© le fait que ce qui reste sur la table est Ã  emporter, mon chum qui n'avait pas pu venir avec nous Ã  beaucoup apprÃ©ciÃ© aussi! Les desserts sont tout simplement Ã  tomber par terre. Le yogourt glacÃ© Ã  l'Ã©rable, oui, s'il vous plait. Une belle expÃ©rience, je vous conseille de ne pas trop manger durant votre journÃ©e avant de vous y rendre et de rÃ©server plusieurs mois Ã  l'avance (pas le choix!)"}
{"text":"The king of Montreal restaurants. Manages to combine an amazing and decadent menu with a sophisticated but very casual neighbourhood feel. A must-eat place!"}
{"text":"This is the first place that came up on looking up places to eat in Montreal.  And yes, there are other things to do in Montreal besides.....  And while trying to make reservations for 15 doods months in advance, the consensus throughout Montreal is, don't bother.  You're not going to find a reputable dining establishment that would take a large party like that.  And so, its up to the brave and the determined to find a window of time through the weekend of debauchery to make a trip out here and get a togo order to prove that the 300+ reviews are justified.  And who better to do it than I.  I and my friend (who I dragged of course) took a cab going the opposite direction as the rest of the group and got 4 orders of Duck In A Can to go.  It may not sound like much, but after reading all the previous reviews, I was convinced this was a must.  And after all the commotion and dropping $50 per order, it was worth it.    Although heavy overall, that duck is some heavenly beast packing a punch in that aluminum containment waiting to let loose on the flavors and merriment of tender duck breast, duck leg confit, and foie gras.  And I'm sure all it takes is a simple baking session to prepare prior to serving.  I even had a discussion with the server on how to best preserve the serving of the dish while having to take a 30 min cab back to the hotel.     I wasn't going to leave Montreal without poutine and of course, some nice French fare."}
{"text":"We had a raucous time at this most celebrated eatery. Mostly what I remember is being so stuffed that it was borderline uncomfortable. The owner of the place was there that night and he kept ringing this bell which would signal the kitchen staff to take a drink. So much fun...  Anywoo,  the foie gras... that was the highlight of the meal (though we're not used to it being so veiny). We had a couple of different varieties, along with the \"PDC's cut\" (huge), and the \"PDC's melting pot\". We even managed to stuff down some french fries cooked in duck fat. Luckily we walked there through the snow and ice so we managed to at least burn some calories walking back to our hotel.  So much meat it kinda bedazzles the taste buds, but you could hardly call that a complaint. But if you're looking for a quiet, romantic night out- that this is not. But for a fun time with a lot of meat this is your spot."}
{"text":"This place is insanely delicious.  The restaurant is a bit tight on space but the kitchen is opened. You can actually hear the staff call out orders.    There are so many options that we probably over ordered for two people!! For starters, we had poutine with foie gras, duck carpaccio and beef tongue.  For entrees we had the duck in a can and the blood sausage tart.  The duck in the can was amazing! We totally over did it on the foie gras but you only live once! We had so much food   We had to call ahead so the restaurant could accommodate our baby."}
{"text":"It's a little difficult to be original when there are well over 100 prior reviews of the same restaurant, but I will say that this place is on my short list of favorite restaurants of all time.  My one gripe about this restaurant, which I will get off my chest is that they give you an end time with your reservation.  Although I didn't expect to go beyond my 2-hour block, I found it a little off-putting.  As for the food.  My wife and I ordered three things.  The tomato tartlet,  ploque de Champlain, and duck in a can.  Although the tartlet was nicely crisp, with juicy tomatoes, it wasn't worth the space in my stomach compared to the other two dishes.  The ploque de champlain was one of the best things I have ever eaten.   It was sorta like a breakfast food but to the most extreme.  It contained stack of a pancake, potatoes, bacon, seared foie gras, and overflowing with maple syrup.  Truly memorable.    While gimmicky, the duck in a can, which comes with like a half a duck, a huge lobe of foie gras and other assorted bits in a rich brown sauce, and poured tableside over celery root puree is phenomenal.  Perhaps it wasn't the smartest thing to order after the ploque de champlain because it was excessively rich.  And to top it off, we ordered the pudding chomeur, which had a seared caramelized top with an inside was served so scorching hot, it burned the roof of my mouth.  Not surprisingly, it was very sweet and very rich.  Next time I make my way back to Montreal, I want to go for some of the raw bar, which looked extremely fresh.  This place caters to serious eaters that are open to trying new things.  I wouldn't recommend taking someone who has any food phobias.  I would also recommend eating something very light earlier in the day since your gall bladder will be working on overdrive after you've finished your meal.  Overall, the meal cost roughly $60/person, which I thought was pretty reasonable considering the amazing food experience."}
{"text":"DEHC - CUH - DEHNCE. Decadence.   Eating at Au Pied de Cochon has been one of my best dining experiences. It's not cheap, but the environment is not stuffy. It's lively and cramped, and comfortably overwhelming. We sat at the bar and watched as the 10 chefs in the tiny kitchen worked in unison. It was entertaining as we waited an 1.5 hours for our pigs head.   In between us and the pig's head, we had a few appetizers. The fried fois gras and carpaccio. The fois gras happily popped in our mouth.   Finally, alas when our pigs head came out all eyes were on us. It was over-the-top. There was a half lobster in it somewhere. A gold foil delicately balanced on the dead pig's head cheek. A separate sauce was made to drizzle on the brains. Who knew the head contained all these marvelous textures of pork? AU PIED DE COCHON did. We washed it down with delicious local beer (Cheval Blanc)   Expensive, but plus side was, being American it felt like the menu was 25% off.   NOTE: THE BATHROOM IS COOOOL. It had one of those 1k toilets installed with the warmed seats, but not the kind of warmth when you know the person before you just took a dump.   SIDE NOTE: I enjoyed this pig's head more than the pig's head at Cockscomb in San Francisco."}
{"text":"You know that feeling you get on thanksgiving after you've eaten that last bite of pie at the end of the meal that put you over the edge? Try multiplying that by 10 and then dumping all-you-can-eat foie gras on top and you get the Au Pied de Cochon experience.  Don't get me wrong - the food was AMAZING!!! I'm just saying you shouldn't eat the 24 hours preceding your reservation (and you WILL need a reservation - people were being turned away at the door because the restaurant was fully booked until midnight!).  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I think I had a more 'fine dining' experience in mind when I booked a table for me and my sister during our Montreal vacation. I was greeted with a bustling bistro/pub combo that fully embraced the gorgeous summer weather with an open storefront. Our table wasn't ready but they had availability at the bar with a perfect view of the kitchen, so we opted for the 'dinner and a show' experience. It did not disappoint! There were 2 cooks (chefs?) in charge and a floating number of supporters manning the 2-stove, 12-burner, no flat-top, and one double fryer line. How they pumped out food for what must have been an 80-seat restaurant AND take out orders is beyond me.  The food was DELICIOUS. We opted for the tried-and-true fare - a plate of the foie gras poutine, duck in a can, and the eponymous signature dish. Such richness!!! I've never eaten that much foie gras in one sitting in my life! I couldn't even make it halfway through my entree (and that NEVER happens to me). Even after having a day to reminisce over the flavors, I still can't decide which was my favorite dish - I recommend trying them all.  This is - in every sense of the phrase - a 'splurge meal' (for your wallet and your waistline) but it is WELL worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  The atmosphere is great and the attire is casual so that one feels very comfortable here- not to mention the fact that the waitstaff and hostess are extremely friendly and welcoming to us English-speakers (came with my bf).  We had:  marinated sausage starter- excellent! foie gras duo, consisting of the foie gras hamburger and a 1/2 order of foie gras poutine- the hamburger came out smothered in an absolutely amazing balsamic reduction, it was HUGE and very messy but oh so good. The foie gras poutine was to DIE FOR.  Utterly decadent and rich, even if i had ordered only this I wouldn't be able to finish it! PDC melting pot- my bf ordered this, it was several kinds of very tender pork over cheesy mashed potatoes.  It came with blood sausage which we are not usually fans of but it was super tasty! creme brulee- the best I've ever had. They must use a higher cream to egg ratio too because it was super light, almost like a panna cotta.  To sum it up?  One of the best meals of my life.  I am only sorry that, since we leave Montreal tomorrow, I won't have a chance to try the tomato tartlet, duck in a can and confit lamb shank :(  Guess we'll just have to come back!"}
{"text":"Only one word can really describe this restaurant. AMAZING. Everything is top notch,The service is attentive and friendly, There's an open kitchen which is like watching live theatre. The Food mostly meat and pork with many Fois Gras specials depending on the season. It is a little hectic and loud but fun."}
{"text":"Be sure to make reservations at least a month in advance. I'll preface this by saying this place is probably on my list of top ten restaurants. We started off with onion soup and fois gras Poutine as appetizers...omg soo rich yet soo good! The onion soup had chunks of pork in it! I tasted a hint of beer as well. The flavors worked so well together. Next came our entrees which took about an hour. At first I was pretty annoyed but then got over it because I really needed the hour to digest from my appetizers to make room for my entree. I ordered the duck in the can. I decided to focus on the meat and nothing else because there was no way I could eat the entire entree. It was excellent. My BF got the stuffed pig leg with fois gras. If you plan on getting this please be advised this is probably a 3-4 person dish. My boyfriend barely put a dent in it before he asked them to wrap it up for him. My cousin got the bison ribs...it was HUGE!!! Very tasty!!! My other cousin got the fois gras burger which she wasn't too crazy about. A great bonus was the fact that we got to meet Martin Picard himself!!! He was soo friendly even allowed me to take a picture with him. If it wasn't for the slow service I would've given au pied cochon five stars however honestly the food definitely made up for it!!! Can't wait to come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Waited for a while solo for a bar spot, and it was a culinary experience. I was stuffily dressed in a sport coat, but most seemed to be in hoodies - it's a serious eating place. The food is simply amazing. I might need to run a few miles tomorrow though..."}
{"text":"One of the best in the city, if you can get a table outside on a nice night it is ideal; however, the casual atmosphere inside is welcoming too. The quality of the food is outstanding, we didn't even try the foie gras OR the Poutine, so if you don't care for either of these items, there's still plenty of options. I never leave five stars- but three days later, we're all still talking about it. FYI, the pork shank with risotto is outrageous, and two people can definitely share it. The wine list is extensive and the price point is better than most in the city. If you only hit one place, make it this one, you must have a reservation, so plan ahead"}
{"text":"Food was really good! Everything was so rich - tasty. The problem was it was FREEZING and nothing could be done to save the meal. the fat pretty much became solid when it got to the table and everyone couldnt enjoy the meal feeling half frozen at the back of the restaurant. The server was friendly and did everything he could to make the experience enjoyable but unfortunately overall it really ruined the experience for us..."}
{"text":"Excellent, excessif, une maÃ®trise complÃ¨te de l'esprit de la cabane.  Les drinks spÃ©cialitÃ©s sont dispendieux, mais vous ne pouvez passer Ã  cÃ´tÃ©, surtout le gin biÃ¨re d'Ã©pinette.  J'y retournerai."}
{"text":"It's been a week, but I am still waking up to the memory of that wonderful stuffed pig foot.   Their signature dish stuff au pied de cocoon is a must have: It can easily serve two people.  Poutine with foie gras: a perfect combination, with the right amount of saltiness and grease. No worry about cholesterol, as we visitors don't the luxury of every day access to such gourmet.   Duck in the can: another very rich dish, duck meat was super tender, and that piece of duck liver is to die for.   Reservation is highly recommended for this restaurant that offers super food with reasonable price.   Probably the only draw back is parking, that could be hard to find in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"My arteries are still hurting from dinner here on Friday.   My mind is still reeling from that balsamic reduction that gently folded over the most insane piece of foie that I've ever had the pleasure of devouring.  My taste buds are still dancing over the sauce that came with my plate of duck - rich, but not cloying, perfect with each melting-ly perfect slice of duck.  I can only thank my lucky stars that we made a reservation to eat here a week or so in advance because the place filled up with drooling patrons as quick as lightning. Which is the exact opposite of how I felt after I finished my meal here. Like a stuffed goose.  Delicious.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mes artÃ¨res sent encore mal apres mon dÃ®ner ici vendredi dernier.  Mon esprit est encore sous le choc de cette rÃ©duction balsamique, qui Ã©tÃ© doucement repliÃ© sur la piÃ¨ce la plus folle de foie que je n'ai jamais eu le plaisir de dÃ©vorer.  Mes papilles dansent encore Ã  la suite de la sauce qui accompagne mon assiette de canard - riche, mais pas Ã©coeurante, parfaite avec chaque tranche de canard.  Nous avons eu la chance que nous avons fait une rÃ©servation Ã  manger ici une semaine ou deux Ã  l'avance, parce que l'endroit rempli assez rapidement aprÃ¨s notre arrivÃ©e.   Delicious."}
{"text":"My group of 4 had a reservation at 7 pm on a Sunday, and it's a good thing we did. We were visiting Montreal from the States and heard this place was great (mostly based on the yelp reviews). It was hard to know what to get because the menu was not very descriptive, in French or English. Our server listed off all the non-menu items they had that day, and it was a LOT. This made it hard to remember and sort through what sounded good. I think we were okay with the food we got, although we thought it was quite overpriced."}
{"text":"So I tried booking a reservation at the restaurant in the beginning of January. I called several times and every time they heard me speak English they hung up. So I tried calling again and spoke French this time and they finally took my reservation for the 12th of February at 8pm.   We arrived a couple of minutes late because of the terrible snowstorm. We already checked out the menu online so we were ready to order as soon as we got there. We wanted to order the hamburger with foie gras and pdc farci (stuffed pig's feet) and the pig's head. It took a while to get our server's attention and the place was not even packed. As soon as we mentioned our orders, the server told us that they do not have any of them available for tonight. My partner and I were very disappointed but I convinced him to stay because might as well... the snowstorm was pretty bad and we did not feel like driving anywhere else.   We ended up ordering the foie gras cromesquis for appetizer and we got the plogue Ã  champlain and the pig's feet with mashed potatoes for the main course. And for dessert, I ordered the earl grey ice cream and the pouding chÃ´meur.   FOIE GRAS CROMESQUIS- Delish! The interior was  a very rich liquid foie gras and the outside was quite crunchy.  PLOGUE Ã CHAMPLAIN- a slice of potato underneath topped with maple flavoured bacon and foie gras. The bacon was probably the best bacon I have ever had, it was juicy, tender and tasty. The foie gras was delicious, it was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  PIG's FEET WITH MASHED POTATOES- the pig's feet was good but not amazing. The meat was really tender and juicy and it was sitting in some kind of brown gravy(kinda reminds me of poutine gravy). The mashed potatoes were the best part of the meal !!! Best mashed potatoes ever ! They mixed it with mozzarella cheese and it tasted just like poutine with the gravy but mashed version , omg ! I would definitely go back just for the mashed potatoes.  EARL GREY ICE CREAM- good but nothing special. They put maple syrup on top which kind of made the top a little sour.  POUDING CHÃMEUR- Delish! Extremely sweet and warm. I always love a good pouding chÃ´meur.   Overall, I was disappointed that they did not have everything on the menu , the service was not the best but the food was pretty good. I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon though. I recently tried the Cabane Ã  sucre and I personally think it's a much better deal."}
{"text":"The authority on rustic Quebecois and Canadian food.  Portions are generous.  Service is friendly.  Wine is extensive, and they'll recommend based on price.  No pretentions, just great food.  No cheap, though.  The duck in the can is a staple of their menu for a reason.  Duck carpaccio was incredibly light and complex.  Maple pouding chomeur was good, but I enjoyed my previous experience with the sugar pie more.  Book well in advance.  Vegetarians should look elsewhere...unless you eat fish."}
{"text":"Au Pied was a sinfully wonderful meal. The Foie Gras Cromesquis, were delicious and exploded with juicy fatness; the apple foie gras was savory, succulent and crispy (and the most well balanced (buttery, salty, sweet, squishy, firm, textured, silky, rich) entree of the night); the duck-in-a-can released a barrage of aromas, followed by more flavors of sin; and the veal, which was incredible on its own, had a bitter green herb that resulted in an unpleasantly acrid reduction (but was easy enough to avoid). Overall it was an exceptional meal. Our only complaint was that the wine we had was our only method of cutting the richness. An amuse bouche just prior to the main courses would have opened things up nicely. A minor complaint, though, and a good excuse to just drink more red wine. Overall it was quite an amazing experience and a lot of fun, too.  Oh, the hostess seems very unhappy.  Perhaps it was a bad night or perhaps the stress is too much, but being greeted with a scorn isn't something most people rate high on the list of what they like in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh my..   Ok, so I've been recommending APCD to anyone that'll listen to me without having being able to go myself.  For the most part, everyone's thanked me for it.  Sooo finally I managed to make it, and it was all I hoped it'd be.  Unpretentious yummy meaty food.  Even though everyone favours the Lamb Shank, I had to go with duck margret, just because it is one of my favourite meats.  As much as I wanted to add a piece of foie gras to the poutine, I couldn't do it.  I only wanted a mild heart attack, not a massive stroke.  The bread.. oh geeze.. I consumed several loafs, and was just completely content with taking it and dipping it in the duck sauce (Barbara Streisand).  All in all.. Yum."}
{"text":"We were so excited to go toothed restaurant for many years! Came to Montreal and since the un-responding  reservations system they have! (Never answer phone calls or messages) finally via email after that gave us a few options of reservation times always after 9:30, we responded and thinking we had a reservation after 2 days they responded they no longer had that time! So we told them any time when ever they had a spot so they gave us 10;30! Got there and half the menu was no longer available! What was available was so disappointing! French fries soggy and burnt! In a French restaurant?.. Horrible presentation of food! Bathroom dirty and extremely slippery on the way in!, would not recommend this place at all! Many other excellent restaurants around Montreal! Like hotel Herman, garden manger,Brenman, Just to name a few.."}
{"text":"I think I must have died and gone to heaven. This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in my life. From the quality of the food to the service of all the staff, I had a fantastic experience. Fair warning, portion sizes are generous and not for the faint hearted. If you have close minded food pals, just order for them and don't explain what it is that they're eating until after the have tasted the glory.   Reservations were initially requested by phone followed by email about 6 weeks in advance. I didn't want to take any chances and wanted to get it out of the way. Made it for Thursday at 8:30. We arrived 5 min early and we're seated within fifteen min.   Cocktails: $10 for a delicious bourbon sour. I never thought wild turkey could have been blended so well. It had maple and lime and wasn't too sweet. My mom got a whiskey sour special that she enjoyed but felt it was a tad on the sweeter side.  Staters :Foie Gras Cromesquis $4.. An explosion of flavor in your mouth. Order it. You get two bite sized amazeballs. If you aren't familiar with foie gras then think of a savory soup filling inside a crunchy shell.   Apps:  Tarragon bison tongue $8.5  Order it. Don't be scared. The plate is a piece of artwork and the favors are insanity.   Blue cheese, apple & endive salad $10 Order it  Main: Stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras $45. Amazing. But seriously, this can be shared! And even shared, we didn't put an honest dent in it. With the above said orders, this was overkill for a mother daughter dinner. I think we got into about a quarter of it.    Overall, this makes one of the top restaurants I've ever been to in my life.  Thank you, Au Pied de Cochon, for such a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night on a summer night. Fantastic to be in Montreal (I grew up here) during this time of year when everyone's out enjoying the evenings and nightlife that Montreal has to offer. Was clued into this restaurant by my brother, who still lives here, so decided to give it a try with my SO.   I'm a big poutine lover so when I heard about the Foie Gras poutine dish they served as a starter here, hell, if you're a foodie you should be able to appreciate and love Foie Gras. And it being poutine, hey, why not? When it came to the table, I was underwhelmed. It was just a plate of poutine with a piece of Foie Gras laid on top of it. There was no originality to it other than the fact that the head chef must have thought it would be cool just to lay a piece of duck liver on top of a dish of poutine just for kicks, charge an arm and a finger for it and reap the rewards of all Montrealers & Quebecois that enjoy the artery-choking, gut-busting nature of poutine, and add some delicacy on top of it for good measure. Taste was good but otherwise, the Foie Gras itself was not done in a typical French way that actually preserves and brings out the nature, flavor and richness of the Foie Gras itself.  Next was Duck-in-a-Can and the PDC Melting Pot. My SO and I have stomachs the size of...a can, not a beer barrel. The servings of both of these were for very healthy (and hearty) appetites so you definitely get what you pay for here.   The Duck-in-a-Can is served, literally, from a can that's opened up in front of you with a can opener, and served on top of a piece of toast and puree. You could see the oil from the duck fat just drip out of that can too (the serving piece is the duck breast with the skin on it). This is realllllly rich food and not to be messed with if you have gastrointestinal problems. Bring your Pepto-Bismal with you if you're faint of heart for these kinds of foods! The taste? Pretty darn good but a little convoluted and mixed up with all the other ingredients mixed into the can. It can be compared with \"Mom's pile of mess baked in the oven\".  The PDC Melting Pot had a bunch of stuff in a little clay pot (similar to a little Le Creuset pot). It was filled with stewed pork, seaweed wrapped blood sausage, pork sausage, mashed potatoes and shallots (could have been something else). It was, again, a mish-mash of stuff put together as an experiment but it definitely didn't highlight any individual ingredient particularly well. Again, there seemed to have been no imagination put into this as it felt like someone just decided to shove a bunch of varieties of meat in there, throw some mash in for a base and broil it up for a sure fire, artery-choking experience. (You get the theme of this restaurant now.)  Nothing about these dishes were \"bland\" at all. But nothing about these dishes also spoke to the uniqueness of why PDC is sooooo popular. I think the roasted pig's head and leg of pig should have been selected.   My 3 star rating is for the promise of the other entrees that we should have selected and the hint of madness in the head chef's experimentations. I grew up in Montreal but I didn't remember ever having been knocked over the head with anything so rich and heavy as PDC."}
{"text":"For a place named for pig, we may have ordered the wrong stuff...but I am NOT sorry about that ONE bit! We got the lobster roll & small order of the fois gras poutine. Both were absolutely phenomenal. I don't use that word lightly folks. PHENOMENAL. The poutine was surprisingly not heavy, given what it is...fries, gravy, fois gras...It's a MUST try. I can't sum it up in words. The lobster roll was equally as remarkable. The bread was perfection, fresh, crispy just where it needed to be, buttery (I love the French and their butter obsession) and the lobster chunks were gigantic and fresh! There was fresh parsley in the lobster meat as well as something else that I can't quite put a finger on. The result was something truly unforgettable.   Get a reservation. This place is busy around the clock for a reason & it's tiny. If I ever return to Montreal, this will be first on the list to revisit."}
{"text":"Exquisite foie gras. The rest of the food was good. Feels a bit over rated. My main issue is that they served us creme brulee that was VERY brulee... so much that it tasted burned. They said that this is how they made it. Makes no sense. I think they burned them and decided to serve them nevertheless. There are many other restaurants in MTL that don't serve burned food..."}
{"text":"Make sure you get a reservation!  Highlights were bluefin tuna tartar and 'duck in a can' entree.  Heavy, meat-focused food, so definitely save up your appetite for that sort of fare."}
{"text":"The service blows -- it took a full 10 minutes before anyone so much as acknowledged me at the hostess stand (and they New Yorkers are rude). The waiter gave us a very inaccurate description of a special dish for two -- which ended up being four chunks of lobster and what was supposed to be 200 grams of fois gras -- but instead it was a mess of over-salted pasta covered in cheese for $70. It looked like cat food. And they made us wait 20 minutes in between courses.   The poutine with fois gets smaller every year. Way over-hyped and over-priced.  Check out L'Express for really well-prepared food for that kind of money. Dinner for two with wine came to $200 and we took barely took two bites out of our main, but no one asked how it was and then the waiter did nothing about it, charged us anyway. Certainly won't be going back."}
{"text":"It's hard to get a table, so I strong advise to book in advance.  We are from Toronto and for table of 3, booked 2 weeks in advance and we were seated without much wait.  Pros 1) excellent service 2) wine list is great, and the server knows a lot about wine pairing  Cons 1) pretty crowded, wish we could be seated more comfortably"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner.  Had foie gras poutine, foie gras pizza, plogue a Champlain, pasta with meatballs (for my picky eating mom), and a pork shank (similar to a beef bourguignon) (for my picky eating step dad).  The poutine was delicious but a small portion.  The pizza was surprisingly good (I would have never ordered it had the server not suggested it).  The Champlain was tiny but the best dish by far.  The pasta was very very salty but well done otherwise.  The pork shank was lovely.  What was more sensational than the wonderful food was our darling of a server (I think her name was Catherine).  She was knowledgeable, attentive, sweet, and spent a lot of time with our table.  By the end of the night, my parents were inviting her to stay with them if she ever visits the city where they live.  She made our meal so much better.  Overall, an expensive meal, but a great meal.  The foie gras lover in me was very pleased."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  Totally unpretentious, even if you don't speak French.  I sat at the bar and watched the kitchen work it.  I had the vinegar tongue as a starter, just to try it.  It was okay; I've had my quota.  Next I had the beet and goat cheese salad.  I've had this salad at a few places, and I usually love it.  No exception here, and it was a nice complement to the tongue.  Then I had the foie gras terrine with black truffles.  So good!  If not for my greediness wanting dessert, I would have finished that last quarter.  Dessert: oven baked apple.  I did finish that.  Add a glass of wine and some tea, and it was a nice dining experience where I could wear jeans and just enjoy myself."}
{"text":"Wow, this is not a restaurant, it is a house of experiences. Great people, fabulous food, every detail is exceptional. We had a head of lamb, wow ......."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Montreal for the weekend strictly to eat at this restaurant based on the review of a friend. All I can say is Wow! Salt cod fritters were wonderfully crispy outside and tender inside, the sea urchin special was simply devine. We also had two other appetizer specials and shared the duck in a can and a bottle of wine.  If you aren't looking for a romantic night, sit at the bar to watch the kitchen work it's magic. The kitchen staff are cool as a cucumber and the wait staff is extremely accomodating and quick to offer suggestions.  Make a trip to the bathroom to see constant cooking video steam on the flat panel...yeah, I said the bathroom. At first it was odd, but then it was genuinely entertaining.  Overall the food quality was outstanding, they used lots of seasonal ingredients in the specials, and combinations were creative and presented beautifully."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant, you feel like death leaving but in a good way. The food is great and the place makes you want to become a food junkie. Don't know what else needs to be said but just eat there."}

{"text":"Martin Picard is one of my favourite Food Network chefs.  So of course I had to come to his prized gem.   I also came on Tony F.'s behalf.  So Tony, this one's for you!  I had called and made a reservation the week prior, but upon arrival they seem to have lost my reservation.  Not a problem as they were able to accomodate us.    As part of some strange rebellion my stomach was having against food (e.g. I seemed to never feel hungry), I didn't gorge at APDC.  Of the lot, I tasted the foie gras cromesquis, the salade PDC as well as the duck in a can.   Foie gras and duck have always been a favourite of mine and so naturally, this would be the meat I chose for my conquest.  The bread at APDC has now taken over the title of best bread ever. The spot previously belonged to the Woodlot in Toronto.  Their bread was only slightly warmed, but was very crusty on the outside, yet very soft in the centre.   The foie gras cromesquis came first.  They are two dice-sized cubes, which the waiter explains has to sit for about 2 minutes prior to indulging simply because they are very hot.  Words really cannot describe the sensation I experienced as I bit into the fried exterior...I think the moment I bit into it, I must've blacked out from the intense flavour that was bursting on my tongue.  The only way I could describe the flavour is an intense, savoury, mouth-watering, French-onion-soup-like concoction with the buttery goodness of foie gras.  Don't be fooled by its petiteness. Its kind of like how everyone expects the short guy to suck at basketball because of his runt height, and then he ends up being the next Michael Jordan.  The only thing I would've changed about it is that I probably would've preferred a thinner battered exterior- though I'm sure the reason why it is such a thick batter is so that it doesn't melt the contents inside.    After having pondered further, we decided to add an order of the much-talked about foie gras poutine to our order (although we were iffy as to whether or not we'd be able to devour all this food!)  My original intent of ordering a salad was to counterbalance the otherwise rich food that would follow suit throughout the evening... however, as I soon found out - there is NOTHING light about the fare that is served a la Martin Picard.  The salad was made from pig knuckle, bacon bits, sundried tomato, greens, and a very twangy and tart vinaigrette.  I found the salad to be a little too oily for my liking, and the tartness of the vinaigrette was so overpowering that even the heavy-weight contender (otherwise known as bacon) lost its dominant flavour.  All I could taste was sour twang.  The deep-fried pig knuckle was nicely done - hats off for the spicy mustard that topped it.  It was an amazing mÃ©lange.    Next came the duck in a can... Maybe I had sky-high expectations from all the hype and talk about it on Yelp, but I was not that impressed.  The duck breast was hard to cut into, even with our Atila-the-Hun-sized knives.  The layer of skin made me want to run and hide because it was so thick!  I have had roast duck at a Chinese restaurant before, and the skin is not usually that thick?  It was like a slab of fat and I just didn't care for the texture.  The foie gras that was in it was very nicely done, although not seared, still had a very nice flavour to it.  It was served with a turnip purÃ©e that had accents of bitterness to it.  The base of the dish was made with some sort of crostini and topped with a sauerkraut-like vegetable mixture that had a hint of tartness to it.  I think I was actually the most disappointed with this dish.  Finally, came the foie gras poutine.  I am SOOOOOOO glad we collectively decided to order this dish because it made the experience.  I've had a foie gras poutine at Trevor Kitchen & Bar in Toronto, and it was swimming in oil... However, when the APDC version came out, I took a sigh of relief to find that it was not the least bit oily.  Bravo!  The gravy was the most amazing gravy I have ever tasted.  It is made with foie gras, a secret powder, and egg yolk.  The cheese curds were not salty, as the usual (which allowed the flavour of the gravy to really stand out).  The gravy was so good that I took the remaining slices of bread and soaked it all up!  It was just too good to waste.  APDC was definitely an adventure, though it fell short of my expectation."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of our server from another restaurant. This place is Foie Gras heaven, Foie Gras extraordinaire!! I mean, if you like Foie Gras, definitely come here and taste their many different variations of it...and that we did.  We started off with their sashimi appetizer on top of this rock salt thing and also their poutine with..you guessed it, Foie Gras! Delicioso!!!  They also paired it with a yummy red wine!  Unfortunately for our main course, we had this meat plate that didn't live up to our expectations. It was all boiled meats that was chicken, bone marrow, sausage and maybe even duck. It's ok though, we wanted something a little risquÃ©, but it didn't hit the mark.  Service was still awesome as they accommodated everything we wanted to try. They constantly checked in on us and gave us recommendations for the next time and even other places to try in the area. Staff is definitely amazing and would come again and try some other stuff."}
{"text":"TrÃ¨s grosse deception pour ce restaurant pourtant trÃ¨s apprÃ©cie par les autres utilisateurs.   Un service trÃ¨s long (repas de plus de 2h30), une erreur dans le service du plat et surtout une nourriture bien trop cher pour sa qualitÃ©.   Un restaurant surfait et surtout bien loin de son image. Pour ma part la cote de cochon heureux etait froide et etouffÃ©e dans une sauce sans gout, les frites au gras de canard trop cuites. Sans compter le vin Ã  50$ qui ne les valait vraiment   C'est sur je n'y retournerais pas, Ã  ce prix la autant aller dans un vrai restaurant (gastronomique tant qu'Ã  faire)  Peut etre que vous aurez une experience diffÃ©rente, en tout cas nous etions 5 et personne n'a apprÃ©ciÃ© !!"}
{"text":"The absolute standout has to be the cromesquis.  I've thought it would be good some time to go sit at the bar and drink, having one or two of them with each drink, and just watch the action in the kitchen, but so far when I've gone to the bar I haven't been able to limit myself just to this.  Almost everything I've had has lived up to billing -- guniea hen for two, duck in a can, bison tongue, plogue champlain, the namesake pied de cochon, crispy PDC salad, guniea hen liver pate, venison liver, and an autumn special once, a small bird (can't remember exactly what kind) cooked in a small pumpkin in soup, artistically presented with the talons sticking out where the lid had been cut out.  My one disappointment -- make me not a fan of the fois gras poutine.  It just doesn't come together at all, too disjointed.  Also the combinatorics just don't work -- there aren't enough fries, you just can't get the right ratios of everything together.  Also be careful not to get too many dishes that are meat or poultry with the same seasonings on the same mashed potatoes with veggies.  The servers are good and I think would make sure you didn't make that mistake,  but better for you to look out for yourself.  (Jasmine's review indicates that you do need to watch out for this yourself;  every time I've been, the server has discussed the combinations we've proposed with us, so ymmv.)  But overall, APDC lives up to the hype, in my experience.  The staff, at least on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, always seem to be enjoying their work and each other, and have always been really friendly."}
{"text":"I have to say... my meal here wasn't all that great. I had bison ribs and they just weren't really interesting or flavourful. The poutine was SO salty and the cheese wasn't melted. How hard is it to make poutine?"}
{"text":"Dining at Au Pied de Cochon is a full-contact sport, like WWE wrestling or Canadian football. People carom off each other in the cramped kitchen, and the frenzy of the dining and prep space is addictive and fun to watch while you're happy you're not stuck in the fray yourself. Service is friendly and in your face.   You're there to eat, which is your role in the full-contact sport. Food is sumptuous, rich, and obscene. It's also quite wonderful and beyond tasty. One server called me a \"warrior\" for polishing off the foie gras stuffed pig foot. The fg poutine was tremendous, as was pickled tongue and a tuna tartare from heaven.   Au Pied de Cochon is not for the weak-hearted. I recommend a hard fast before you enter. Make sure you're nice and hungry, or else this restaurant may cause your stomach to burst and kill you. Don't say you weren't warned.  One last thing. Reservations are essential."}
{"text":"Never fails. Menu changes often. The classics never change.  I recommend getting a bunch of appetizers and sharing an entree."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best meals of my life...Went there a month ago visiting Montreal for the first time after a friend recommended it. Was super lucky to get a reservation at 9pm calling in the morning. ya the place is packed and crammed but that means it a great restaurant. our waiter was awesome and totally hosted us for great recommendations and was funny as hell. Everything we had was awesome, duck in a can was unreal and quite the experience. Poutine was insanely good too. We had absolutely no room for desert but we ordered the maple crÃ¨me brulee and that was incredible...we ate so much incredible food that night, I felt like I was in a food coma after..still at the gym working it off now but it was worth it. will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was 5* Food was 4.5* Atmosphere was 3.5*  We were super excited to try out this place and it (mostly) delivered. We started with wine... They brought out a red for me that I didn't like and replaced it with a white, so nice there, even though they chose the most expensive white...without asking. DH had a red. Ordering took a bit of time, but we put in for several courses.... Started with cod fritters.... Yummy but really, save your stomach. Then had a special, pig heart... Good, but strong flavors... Then fois gras pan seared.... DH loved this one, but I thought the balsamic reduction was too strong... All of these were brought out at once, so eat fairly fast as hot is best.  We also had a few helpings of fresh French bread... Yummy, butter was nice and they also serve an odd but good cream sauce with the bread. Our first main course was the famous Duck in a Can... WOW!! This is a ton of food but all very good..but we did have a slight problem, DH found a piece of plastic in it! More on this below.... Our second main course was a mistake, and by that I mean it was amazing but we were too full for more than a bite each...made lovely leftovers though! We finished with a maple toffee milkshake....sooo good and rich!  For the duck issue...they apologized, collected the part, and took it off the bill. Nice service again there, especially considering the cost of the dish!  Cons... Very crowded and hard to hear. Bathrooms are mid way down and behind the bar, a but awkward and one of the doors had a broken lock...I did report it and I believe they fixed it but I didn't check back.  Overall a lovely experience and the duck on a can label now has a special place on our kitchen wall!"}
{"text":"The craziest thing that comes to my mind is my peaceful digestion after such a heavy meal. Now let's talk. I see PDC as a highly focused and high-end meat experience with no equivalent. The meat choice is impressively diverse and the risks taken by the cuisine are commendable. Indeed, I found some interesting combinations of French, Spanish and Northern American influences in the dishes and preparations. Above all, PDC also stands on its own as it reveals how complex and subtle heavier meats can be in terms of tastes and preparation.   It will take you more than a visit to get accustomed to the opulence of the menu. But so far and for two, I'd recommend: - the Accra de morue: those of you who are familiar with these will understand how perfect they are; - the Foie gras poutine (I actually came with this dish in mind as it sounds cleverly insolent ) as an appetizer; - the Potee du PDC with its selection of different meat laying in an authentic Aligot (Southwestern French specialty made of cheese and puree).  Service is the main flaw I would highlight: the manager suffers from excessive pendanticivitis and the waiter have some surprising preconditions for Alzheimer's disease."}
{"text":"Amazing food here but huge portions so share...also ask for seat at the bar so you can watch the magic in the kitchen. They are like Santa's elves that work so efficiently    The foie Gras here is amazing and the main courses are great especially their duck!!"}
{"text":"I was here over a year ago so I cant write a detailed review of the dishes that I had.  But I do remember that it was all very delicious.  I had heard great things about it and I was not dispointed.  I was there on a sat night so it was crowded, and I took a spot at the bar and watch the kitchen crew hard at work.  It was all pork all the time.  And they had a good wine by the glass menu.  If I ever go back to Montreal, je reviendrai!!  Ca vaut vraiment le coup d'y aller.  Ce restaurant serais un succes a Paris.  C'est si bon que ca."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. This remains one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. The atmosphere is comfortable / casual and the emphasis is absolutely on culinary excellence. Eating here is an experience, one that resonates days, weeks, months after there meal is over. I have a difficult time making a decision on what to order, unlike a lot of restaurants that have predictable menus and standard offerings, a \"standard\" offered at Au Pied de Cochon will not be standard ... it will exceed your expectations.  This place lives up to its reputation, why I'm able to still get a seat there without waiting 1/2 a year is a mystery! TIP: the bread is excellent but try to lay off it before the meal, the portions are generous and often rich."}
{"text":"This restaurant remains outstanding, and has never lost sight of what makes it great.    Knowledgeable servers, classy management on hand, strong menu... ....just an overall high level of service and pride of ownership across the cutting board.    *Foie gras poutine is the best poutine you will have anywhere on the planet - that is a promise - you need to get it, even just to share *French Onion Soup is an easy 8 out of 10 *Duck in a can is an experience worth having at least once - Mmmm....... and although the pig head or pig's feet dishes take about 45 minutes to cook... they are pretty amazing...like everything else here..."}
{"text":"Another one of those restaurants that your friends outside of Montreal tell you you have to try. As an important tip, you MUST call and make a reservation in advance. They do not take walk-ins, even if it looks like there might be a few empty tables.  The warm, fresh bread and service were great, but it ends there. The restaurant smelled a bit stale, and their A/C was dripping. Their prices were expensive considering that it felt like a casual ambiance.   Between the 4 of us, we shared a bison tail appie (7/10, nothing special, tastes like ox tail); foie gras poutine (7/10, nice and rich gravy, but curds weren't the best and the foie gras was just sort of there); Duck in a Can (7.5/10, neat concept, nice flavours, too greasy); pied de cochon hot pot (7/10, decent, nothing special about flavours); a beef steak with pasta dish (5/10; way too much salt and wine!); maple creme brulee (6.5/10, too sweet and texture was like pudding); pecan tart with ice cream (7/10; standard tasting, crust was a bit overbaked).  In short, try it only if you're so curious, or if don't mind paying $$$ for salty food drenched in duck fat. ;)"}
{"text":"I am haunted by dreams of the Foie Gras Cromesquis, Foie Gras Hamburger, and Duck in a Can.  This place is solely responsible for breaking my 10 year tenure of vegetarianism,   We make a semi annual pilgrimage to APDC from New York City and its always worth it. If you go as a couple try a get a seat at the bar and you'll be treated royally. Excellent wine list, the food is unlike anything else, it is simply unmatched.  The chefs are trying to kill you in the most loving way,honestly it's more like assisted suicide. If you eat here in February you won't need a coat to walk to your car after the food process of digesting is warming enough.   The food is like opium, you will be addicted and intoxicated by the time you are done."}
{"text":"A fantastic experience especially if you like foie gras and I do! I can't wait to go back again! I would have given this place 6 stars if it were available! You must try this place when you visit Montreal if you can get a table! Oh and by the  way there's an article it's in this months Playboy magazine!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one my favorites. We were lucky enough to get a reservation with little notice and could not have been more pleased. The service was phenomenal, as was the atmosphere. Food was so reasonable priced given the quality of ingredients. We left with our pants unbuttoned, to be sure, but we wanted to try everything and it was all so good we couldn't stop. The melting pot was my favorite, as was the foie gras. The dessert pie was heavenly. I may even go to Montreal again just to eat here."}
{"text":"continuing our food crawl here in montreal, we came here for dinner. :) our seating was the 530 -730 crowd. it is located in a very cute neighborhood off of rue st. denis. about a 10-15 min cab ride from the w hotel. food was fantastic. hub had the steak & frites and i had the foie gras burger. i just couldn't resist. i know everyone orders the can item but i was feeling the burger. one of the more $ burgers ive had at $39. :) worth it though. HUGE portion so i had to take some home - lunch tomorrow. :) the burger is made of foie gras and regular beef mixed in w/ this special pink vinaigrette sauce. all the flavors just blended perfectly. love the casual vibe of the restaurant. our entire row of tables (5) were all american. funny. we have come to realize that good food in montreal is more affordable. our meal was $100 or so and i think it would have been at least $150 in sf. hubs only ordered a beer too so no alcohol included. how did i forget the french onion soup??? a must order if you like to have some soup with your cheese. devoured in cheese and one of the best we have ever had anywhere in the world. divine! for dessert, we had the baked apple and it hit home since we didn't want anything too decadent eg., chocolate. service was good and friendly. DEFINITELY coming back the next time we are in town to try other items on the menu. leave yourself some time to explore the shops as well."}
{"text":"I have been here before and the food is off the hook. I emailed for a reservation a month ago. I got a response that said please call the restaurant or provide a number for your reservation. I replied with my cell number and hearing nothing assumed I was booked.   My usual trip to Montreal is a day one but  as APC is dinner only I booked a hotel for overnight.   Day of, my date was sick so I thought rather than wait till the 6pm reservation, I would just arrive when they opened and sit at the bar.   When the restaurant opened I was 3rd in line 2 in front of me 2 behind.  They could not find my reservation, and stated they do not do email reservations. Further, they stated they were completely booked and there are no walk-ins. A completely empty restaurant at 5pm and apparently no room for a lone customer who traveled 800 miles there for dinner with what I thought was a reservation.   Sometimes suceess breeds egoism, but when a restaurant looses focus on hospitality, they can easily leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.  FYI I am not neophite when it comes to dining out. Check my profile."}
{"text":"One word: WOW  This place was packed even when we arrived for our reservation for 10pm. We were quickly seated and based on reviews here, I knew I wanted to order duck in a can for sure, not just for the concept but for the food as well. Our server who is very knowledgeable about the food here recommended that we share two dishes because anything more than that is more than enough. And he was right!  We ended up ordering duck in a can - $44 and Plogue Ã  Champlain - $29, and two glasses of chardonnay - $10.  Both of these two dishes have small amounts of fois gras, if you are a first timer try not to order dishes with a lot of fois gras in them. Eating a bit of it is okay, but I find that if you're eating a lot of it, you'll end up getting sick of it after.  The duck in a can is a cool concept, the chef makes the duck, then seals it in a can where the server will come to your table, open the can and pour out the food on a plate for you. The reason why it's put in a can is because it's to seal all the flavours. The duck is very flavourful, not dry at all. Best dish I've had.   And the Plogue Ã  Champlain is something I've never had before, the taste is very unique and different. It is \"a small mound of buckwheat pancake, layered with melted cheese, roasted fingerling potatoes, bacon, all topped with a slab of seared foie gras and drizzled with maple syrup--heaven\".   Service was fine, I found that they took care of big groups around us much more which I can understand. Anyways, it was a pricey dinner but well worth it!"}
{"text":"A dream come true, all expectations were met, you must go and stuff your self like a the duck liver you eat.  Our travel adventure was complete with this 10pm reservation. After walking and biking 30km all over the lovely city of Montreal, we excitedly arrived 20 minutes early and were seated with ease. The sound of active chefs and waitstaff and happy customers were exactly what we wanted to hear as we sat down next to the bar and the flashy activity of the kitchen.   We ordered the house brews, the foie croquettes -magic in a boxy bite!, zucchini flowers, and steamers, effin' delish! The Duck in a Can was amazing, high class hobo dining.  Holy shit, I wish I had a second stomach so I could have finished the rest of this dish. Husband gorged on the stuffed pig foot, good but not for me, just a little too rich. He scarfed it down like a good hairy animal.   MERCI!"}
{"text":"We made the reservation two weeks ago. Probably because it's weekday, we are the only customers at 5:00pm. We didn't drink alcohol, only a bottle of water. The water is in glass bottle, taste better than thesame brand in plastic bottle. Tarragon Bison Tongue is the first dish. The tongue is from beef. Mr. Tang said it's good. I prefer the pickle, since I didn't try the tongue. Catch of the day, we picked the smoked eel. It also served with a piece of veal bone, you can eat the marrow(not sure if it's this word...). Fg poutine is great, although foie gras is too greasy for me. The duck in a can is great too. The duck is juicy and fresh, also with blood. The veggie taste a bit sour, really savory. The one missing star is for the dessert. Both icecream and pecan pie are too sweet for me to enjoy."}
{"text":"If you want to come for an Experience, come with a group of 6ish and you might be able to take advantage of the tasting menu (they'll basically choose dishes for you). We saw another table with a foie gras cake dessert/appetizer which was said to be perfect if you're an absolute lover of foie gras!  Our meal started with a deep fried foie gras appetizer which can only be described as a foie gras explosion. It was phenomenal - and it was only the beginning! Next app was the foie gras poutine (a MUST try if you love foie gras and poutine), then a seared foie gras on top of a potato 'pancake' with a honey maple syrup (omg so good) and then an app of skewers with rabbit kidney and foie gras.  Our mains included the duck in a can, shank with parmesan risotto, and maple ham. I'm usually not a ham person, but DAMN was it a good ham. The maple glaze was outstanding and if you happen to like sweet bbq sauces I definitely recommend it. Everyone loved every dish though so it's really up to you!  BTW it will probably be the fattiest meal of your life, but you'll be glad to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"Amazing food, so decadent and delicious. Started with the foie gras pancake cheese plate and then the old hen dish for two. It was excellent and well worth it. The staff and service were also top notch would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I learned about Au Pied de Cochon years ago, from a comic book about Martin Picard's life before the creation of the restaurant. It was a beautiful book, and although it didn't showcase much of the food, the story made me curious. After I moved to Montreal, I had the chance to eat there. A visiting friend from New York had reserved a table for her last night in town. It was one of the first times I ate at an \"expensive\" restaurant, but it almost didn't feel like it. I was certainly younger than most patrons, and was quite intimidated upon entrance. But after a few minutes, the welcoming and warm atmosphere of the place made me feel at ease.  The wooden interiors of the place reminds of a cozy, fancy cottage. The buzzing sound of conversations and laughter was cheerful and vibrant. The staff was cordial and professional. It felt great to be surrounded by a friendly crowd and about to have a mighty good meal. I ordered the famous Foie Gras poutine. My friend had the Duck in a Can. Both dishes were impressive, but also quite overwhelming toward the end. It was the first time I had foie gras and I loved it!   It's easy to see why Au Pied de Cochon has achieved such renown in Montreal and worldwide. It is not only authentic to its birthplace, but to itself as well.  Anecdote: As I was taking a picture of my friend, I noticed a middle aged man pointing at my camera - the strap was dipping in my olive oil dish - I promptly moved it away and smiled to the guy to thank him. That's when I realised he was Chef Picard! :o"}
{"text":"Best foie gras I have ever tasted bar none. Don't expect your upscale sophistication in plating. It's a mess but the decadent taste more than makes up for it. The chef (captain picard :) ) looks like a sweaty mad man, nice guy but the more you look at him, the more you think to yourself \"is he for real...errr... why am I here?\" Don't eat too much bread while waiting for the food, you will regret (generous portions and everything is heavy artery blocking fare) Foie gras duo and why of course the Pied de cochon (huge pigs hock stewed to perfection with a sloppy creamy concoction poured over it) are to die for. Be prepared to walk for 45 min + (St Denis back to the hotel areas @ crescent on a good evening) to get arteries working again. But seriously, that's what REAL good food is all about."}
{"text":"Really tasty food, excellent service and nice wine list."}
{"text":"There's overrated and then there's Au Pied De Cochon. Worshipped by the New York Times, celebrity chefs, and self-described \"foodies\", Au Pied De Cochon has the reputation for being one of the best restaurants in the city.  It's undeserved. Here's my theory as to why the hype: it's greasy and unhealthy comfort food dressed up as haute cuisine for so-called foodies who claim to like fine dining when in reality they secretly crave greasy and unhealthy comfort food. In other words, it's fast food for pretentious people with big wallets. For all the ink that's been spilled over chef Martin Picard's \"masterful synthesis \"of the high and the low (a fusion of fine dining with blue collar working class grub), a poutine dressed up in foie gras is still just a poutine (only with more fat and cholesterol).  Call me unimpressed."}
{"text":"So over the top without jumping the shark. The son and I went on our Tour De Food au Montreal. We were impressed. We sat in front of the chefs at the bar (you might find the heat intolerable; we took off our top layers) and watched food in preparation and got asked about how we were digging on the fried smelts served in a ball jar with a dollop of spicy aoli at the bottom, a seasonal special. Next was the well-known, and maybe a little notorious Foie Gras Poutine. And if we hadn't gotten enough foie gras in that dish, it was in the next two. Is fat the official food of Montreal? Or foie gras? We duck in a can - with foie gras! And a dish with a name I forgot that consisted of a buckwheat crepe, melted cheese, potatoes, foie gras (No! Really?), some charcuterie, all topped with some maple syrup-based sauce. It was all amazing and all of it a revelation.   Dessert was an amazing ice cream soda, with maple syrup, seltzer, a half-cup of stout and maple ice cream, all constructed at your seat by you and your server.   Drinks were the house draft beer and shots of Jack  Daniels flavored with maple syrup.   Decor, service, excellent. Noise was not so bad. For the two of us: $178 CAD with tip. Yeah, the food is pricey, but this is pricey food. Foie gras, maple products, charcuterie, and duck should be expensive."}
{"text":"So if you love foie gras, this place would probably be your heaven.  I did like the foie gras cromesquis and mashed potatoes.  However, I found the rest of the dishes to be very, very oily.  The duck in a can was a fun concept, but way too heavy for our liking.  We also thought the chicken burger was fun since it came to us in a fast food paper box, but again, it was so oily that the paper surrounding the sandwich was soaked through.  Biggest mistake was I ordered the fish n chips b/c I'm not the foie gras fan--my husband is.  I blame myself.  Why would anyone get fish n chips at a Canadian French restaurant that focuses on foie gras and meat? The sturgeon was so fishy, I couldn't even finish it.  They were really nice about it though and let us replace the fish with something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Warning !!!! Don't even try to get here without a reservation esp on a weekend. We tried getting in on a Friday night - no luck finally made a reservation for Saturday night got a place at 11:30P. The food is heavy we ordered for a foie gras poutine, a duck in a can and a leg of pig. The waitress advised us that it'll be a lot for the two of us and yes it was (even without the duck in a can) which we saw served literally out of a can :)   I would recommend coming here in a large at least 4 people so that u can taste what they have on the menu and not waste food"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short: raw foie gras on my foie gras poutine? Hahahaha, hell no. A waste of time (long lines) & money.   (I still love the actual restaurant mucho though)"}
{"text":"Do you want tasty, tasty decadence? Well sir/madame, you've come to the right place. Huge portions with lots of butter, fat & meat.   I had the foie gras topped with foie gras sauce, rolled through foie gras bits, with a side of foie gras.  Ok I didn't but I probably could have.  Side-note: the floor is slippery as all hell, snow goop does not make for fun dining room hikes."}
{"text":"OH HOLY HELL!  This was our best dining experience in Montreal, and probably top 5 in my lifetime.  I don't know what else I can add other than giving a breakdown of our perfectly planned dinner that did not leave us overly stuffed.  Table for 2: Foie Gras Cromesquis (I could pop like 20 of these in my mouth), Blue Cheese, Apple & Endive Salad (i know.. a salad.. but i think the acidity helped prepare for the glutony ahead), and the Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras.  Now the star is the actual stuffed leg, but I swear I developed an addiction to the mashed potatoes underneath, which tasted like the best boxed potatoes blended with the powder on sour cream and chive potato chips.  I mean this as a compliment.  They were delicious. We ordered 4 glasses of wine.. the $10 was not worth it, but I do recommend the $11 glass underneath it on the menu. Our waiter also kicked some serious ass. Hope to see you again!"}
{"text":"If there's one place to recommend in Montreal, it will have to be Au Pied de Cochon.   Make sure to call weeks ahead for dinner reservations to secure a table. My friend and I winged it and walked-in hoping something was open and sure enough, they had two seats at the bar. We were stoked as we saw the view in front of us. We had the best seats in the house! It's an open kitchen with the entire crew sans Chef Martin Picard, working within an arm's reach. We got to see all the action, interacted with the chefs, and witnessed all the dishes before they got served to all the tables. How awesome is that?  We were off to a slow start with our server being so busy with other tables but he got us started with our beers and gave us enough time to figure out what to get. It was a struggle as everything on the menu sounded so decadent. Being from California, the banning of foie gras has made me craving for it. This place has foie in almost all their dishes. Imagine my excitement!   Here's what we ended up getting which my dear friend and I all shared:  FOIE GRAS CROMESQUIS ($3.50) or croquettes if you will. It's filled with foie gras jus oozing out as you bite into the crisp, deep-fried breading. It was really just a bite to tease us for what's next to come.   Then came the GUINEA HEN LIVER MOUSSE ($8). A jar filled to the brim with the mousse accompanied by some orange marmalade and sauerkraut on the side to complement each other. This proved too enticing for me to resist wiping out completely. Ask for extra toast if you run out or use the table bread which by the way, was also hard not to indulge in. Warm, crusty, and fresh from the oven.  A special of the evening was their MOULES FRITES ($10). This was not on the menu but we saw lots of these coming out of the kitchen and we just had to order it. For an appetizer, the serving was hefty. The sauce, wow, buttery with bacon bits and a hint of white wine. It was addicting and to dip the bread in it was inevitable until all the white creamy liquid was no more.   We had quite a pause until our main course came. We welcomed it and watched the live show in front of us, oohhh'ing and ahhhh'ing as we saw beautiful plates of pig heads, pied de cochons, foie poutines, meatloafs, and ducks in a can pass right in our faces.   Finally, the star of the show, STUFFED PIED DE COCHON WITH FOIE GRAS ($45) was laid in front of us. It was ginormous! We were planning on getting an order each initially but bless Chef Audrey's heart for letting us know this was a meal a family can consume. The pig's feet was nicely breaded and laid atop a bed of super creamy mashed potatoes, covered with a stew of mushrooms and onions, then topped with perfectly seared foie gras. Rich, decadent, and seasoned without any apprehension, Chef Martin depicts his true colors on this one amazing plate. Needless to say, the other half had to be packed and eaten the next day.   We left completely satiated by the \"in your face\" flavors on every plate and thankful for the crew that was fun and pleasant. Capping off our Montreal trip at Au Pied de Cochon could not have been any better. Merci beaucoup!"}
{"text":"This is a very late review from last summer, but......OUTSTANDING!!! Our server was very knowledgeable and energetic.  We probably ordered more than we should have. The food was all very balanced and creative. The waiter was helpful in pairing wines for each course. Mostly, it was FUN!! The lack of pretension and great people watching turned my wife and mine's \"let's see what it's all about\" dinner into a luxurious date nite. It was a highlight to a great Montreal trip."}
{"text":"The food is everything they say. Decadent, fatty, and delicious. The service was also great: low key, but welcoming, friendly, and solicitous. My only complaint is that I left smelling like a line cook--that's one of the hazards of an open kitchen.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Montreal, I love to go for a celebration! My favourite really is their succulent ribs"}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place is truly off the chain. First of all, I love the vibe of this place. It's off a pedestrian looking street (though I'm pretty sure cars can drive on this street) and inside, it's incredibly warm and happy. Second of all, the food here is incredible. I stopped by the bathroom before I ordered from the menu and literally my mouth was agape at all of the dishes on people's tables.   If you think the same was as my sister and I did, you will want to get the pied du cochon dish - I mean, it seems to be the namesake of the restaurant! But, beware, it is probably the most food I have ever gotten ever. If there's just two of you, I would suggest only getting this dish. there's a ridiculously large and meat filled pig's leg with mashed potatoes underneath laced with cheese and tons of gravy. And, the bread is really delicious so you can get tons of that if you want. The food is so rich that I was almost sick afterwards, so if you don't want that happening for you, take my advice and order on the smaller side."}
{"text":"If you love Foie this is the place for you.  You can't go wrong with anything.  I especially love the carpaccio and PDC salad.  The Foie poutine was great too.  I look forward to coming back to try the other items coming out of the kitchen which passed by me :)  The service and the people were impeccable!"}
{"text":"Yes! Obesity and deliciousness are in a direct relationship at Au Pied de Cochon!  The bread that starts the meal sets the tone. Still warm from the oven with a crunchy crust and a chewy crumb, the butter was just a bonus. It was so good, we had to have a second loaf!  For appetizers, the Cochonnailles Platter is great for sharing and recommended if you want to try a variety of tastes. It was also a good value and came with baguette toast points, 3 different types of pates/terrines, slices of bison tongue, and their homemade beer jelly!   The Tomato Tartlet which sounds like it might have the possibility of being light will fake you out. 3 thin slices of tomato sat upon a thick layer of melted cheese and puff pastry.  Moving on to the entrees, again, if you want to try a variety of tastes I highly recommend the PDC Melting Pot. Served in a staub pot, it was a thick stew of pork belly, pork sausage, and boudin noir all served over smooth, buttery mashed potatoes. For me, the show stopper was the boudin noir which was warmly seasoned and almost creamy inside. I ended up smearing the blood sausage and mashed potatoes on top of the previously mentioned bread. I am a master of obesity.  Less recommended is the Duck Magret. While it was a generous portion and the duck cooked correctly medium rare, the sauce was way too salty.  And you know I couldn't leave without dessert! The Lemon Meringue was cute and tart enough to cut through the heavy meal, but I'm still upset the waiter forgot my coffee.  Thankfully the rest of my trip included lots of walking. But after spending the weekend in Montreal, I'm not surprised why Montrealers eat like this... winter is coming!"}
{"text":"Vaut le prix. Un excellent service et un rare fabuleux repas mÃªme si je me suis senti un peu pas a ma place.  C'est quand mÃªme trÃ¨s hip comme endroit mÃªme si il y a des enfants."}
{"text":"This place is as rich, decadent and sinful as it gets! I had the foie gras poutine, and it did not disappoint. The foie gras was on point - melt in your mouth delicious. Paired with the fries, gravy and curds I thought I was gonna get wheeled outta there but I was able to overcome most of it. I'm sad I did not get to try the duck in a can, but alas I am one person. Their namesake beer is also very good - very crisp with a slight bitter finish. It's great to wash down the poutine. The complimentary bread is also very good. I wanted to eat it all, but I refrained only because the poutine was so big! This is definitely a must if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Bummed that this was our last dinner during our 4 nights in Montreal.  It was disappointing.  They were super busy and we did not get seated until 1 hr after our reservations.  Maybe this was the reason food was not so good.  We had:  - duck carpaccio.  Good but not great.  Couldn't taste the duck flavor.  Tasted like regular beef carpaccio.    - venison tartare - ok but the huge mound of meat got boring since it just came with toasted baguette and salad.   Apparently it cane with fries too but we didn't get ours until 30 min later after we were done with our meal.  We tried a few and they were the worst fries ever.  Soggy, greasy and bland.  We were so surprised that a restaurant with this reputation would let something ghat bad come out of the kitchen.    - duck in a can.  Too oily.  Duck was tough and hard to cut.  Foie gras was just okay and not melt in your mouth like other places.    We've had much better duck and foie gras for less.  The best thing was the red cabbage which gave the rich dish balance.  Service was horrible.  French waiter who rushed through menu items and we had to ask him what things were since menu is not descriptive and he didn't offer to explain anything.  He never returned to ask us how our meal was or if we wanted more wine.  We were there for a total of 2.5 hours and not by choice.  Go to Joe Beef instead.  We went there 2 nights earlier on a busy Friday night and found the food and service was executed very well and a better price point."}
{"text":"This was probably my favorite meal when we were in Montreal. I tried to learn French for this trip but was to shy to try because I was afraid to mess up. So when I asked the waitress if she spoke English she said of course and took amazing care of us. The food was fantastic.  I think the charcuterie board was my favorite part. Everything about our experience there was great."}
{"text":"My expectations were surpassed more than I could have imagined.  I'm not a huge fan of poutine but their Foie Gras Poutine was delicious.  They had a decent amount of foie gras in the poutine and the gravy that covered everything was amazing.  Many recommended the Duck in a Can, so I ordered without really knowing what to expect.  Everything is cooked in a can and then opened in front of you.  After transporting the contents on to a plate, there lies a perfectly cooked piece of duck, a lot of fat, and a huge portion of foie gras.  The duck and foie gras together was a beautiful marriage in each bite."}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon is one of those restaurants where you get excited to go to, but once you're done  you leave swearing to never eat there again, only to find yourself back there ordering something diff on the menu. Great food. Great Service  A+++ will eat again!"}
{"text":"This is a place for foie gras and meat.  I came here with a friend on our last minute weekend trip to Montreal. We shared 4 dishes: fried foie gras balls, foie gras poutine, PDC salad, and the baby pig special. The fried foi gras balls were hot and crispy on the outside, and melted liquid goodness on the inside. Foie gras poutine, however, I didn't want to eat more of after a few bites. The chunks of foi gras were too big to be appetizing for our tastes (we're not used to eating so much of it in that gelatinous chunky form). The PDC salad was really good with nice chunks of meat and crunch to it. The pig special was nicely cooked with crispy outer \"crust\" of the meat and coated with a sweet glaze and came with some vegetables that I enjoyed, but would've enjoyed more if the sauce were less potent.  Overall, it was a very satisfying meal to have on a cold winter night.  If I ever return to Montreal, I'll come back to try the duck in a can (recommended by a coworker)."}
{"text":"The Camion Au Pied De Cochon was parked at Dorchester Square when I saw them.  We ordered some fried pork rinds (skin I guess) dipped in a ranch flavour and some foie gras poutine.  At first I really liked the pork rinds as it tasted like greasy but saltier sour cream and onion rings.  I always had a weakness for those when I was younger. However after a while, it got tired and too salty for my liking.    As for the foie gras poutine, I was not a fan of it at all.  Too heavy and rich for me.  I know that's the purpose of this restaurant, but I couldn't even have 4-5 bites.   On the bright side though, is that it was reasonably priced as both dishes were under $8.50.  Verdict: If you like greasy, salty food, you'll like it.  If you don't and prefer your food a bit less adventurous, then I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food and ambiance.  Make reservations before, or if last minute just see if you can go there and sit at the bar for drinks and apetizers.  Wonderful food, great ambiance and perfect location."}
{"text":"I've been itching to come here for years to try its porky and foie deliciousness.  It did not disappoint.    Our table of four chowed down on the following:    -Tarragon beef tongue with spicy mustard carrots and pickles. Tender and sumptuous. Definitely one of my favorites of the night.   - Veal liver with veal tartar above over a bed of mashed potatoes and a veal gravy. One of the best but potent liver dishes I've had.   - Poutine with fries cooked in duck fat, gravy, mozzarella cheese curds, and foie gras. The foie was just perfectly smooth and delicious.   - boudin tart so a blood sausage tart covered in more foie gras. I enjoyed this a lot.   - Lightly battered pork rectum (yes, really) in a homemade General Tso sauce, and beet and  roasted beets, and a light salad. It was surprisingly delicious though the first bite was fairly funky.   The fresh orange juice and campari slushy was also delicious.  I will say that I felt like I was made out of foie gras and could feel it pulsing through my pores all night.  What a rich and divine meal!    It's fairly small inside and strangely laid out.  When we first entered, it felt like we'd walked in the back entrance and I felt certain we'd come in the wrong way.  It's laid out like a long railcar with the bar/kitchen along one side.  The bathroom's inside the kitchen, which is a bit bizarre.  It's so tight that whenever the waiters came by to bring us water or dishes, they almost had to dance on one leg to bring it over.  But it's warm and inviting and the service was friendly.  Unlike other commenters, I didn't feel like we ordered too much or were pressured to order more.  Our waiter told us we'd ordered just the right amount."}
{"text":"I accidentally checked into the food truck, but I did eat at the restaurant. I would ordinarily never eat at a place like this since everyone knows that a) pork tastes just like human flesh and b) pigs are smarter than dogs. However, I was with a group and my objections were overruled. I planned on enjoying the wine and getting a slice of pizza later, but as it turned out, there is more to this place than pork and foie gras!  They have an emphasis here on fresh and made to order, so unfortunately, a few of the items that I thought I could stomach, such as the garlic whelks, were unavailable. Also, they insist on defiling many of the vegetables with cheddar, the most offensive of the cheeses, and charcuterie. But as luck would have it (for me, at least), the night before our visit, a hapless, 200-pound tuna enjoying a swim in the brisk waters off the coast of Nova Scotia was ensnared by Au Pied's supplier's nets, so there was a great deal of tuna available on the menu.   The server advised that our food would take about an hour to arrive and encouraged us to order an appetizer, so we started with the coppa pizza. The wonderful cheese pie (NOT cheddar, thankfully!) was crowned with a salad of arugula, nutty Parmesan and easily removable charcuterie. Just to up the ante, the server poured a mix of hot and spiced oils to dress the salad.   The food arrived - a variety of pork products topped with foie gras for the others; two obscenely large tuna steaks for moi - and we dug in. The tuna was quite simply the best I have ever had. Perfectly seared and simply seasoned with cracked pepper, the briny taste of the Atlantic was allowed to take center stage. The tuna rested atop a bed of what I sincerely hope was a pork-free polenta and was garnished with some cheddar-less asparagus. Divine!  The restaurant thought ahead and considered the richness of their food in designing their bathrooms, which are equipped with fancy Japanese toilets with fountains, blowers and heated seats. Then hand dryer was out of order and I considered using the toilet to dry my hands, but reconsidered.   We were too full to contemplate dessert, but the dessert menu does feature a great deal of confections incorporating maple. There is also a park about 2 blocks away and I suggest doing as we did and taking a stroll after your meal to aid in digestion.  A final note; the wait staff is wonderful. Everyone was friendly and welcoming, and our server was attentive and extremely knowledgeable about the menu - both wine and food. Top notch!"}
{"text":"C'est bon, mais rien de plus."}
{"text":"There aren't words.  Go here, order everything, eat as much as you can.  I'm glad I live 7 hours away because otherwise my official cause of death would be \"Au Pied de Cochon.\"  All the food is so incredibly rich and delicious.  Great service as well, and the price was less than I expected and than the quality of food would indicate.  Bottom Line: Make reservations, try to sit at the bar to view the open kitchen, go with friends that are willing to eat things like tripe and pig foot, order foie gras, don't look at the prices, dine in the winter to maximize eating of rich and fatty foods, and plan for your meal here to be the last thing you do all day. Because you won't want to move afterwards."}
{"text":"3 words: fantastic, creative, and enjoyable.  A girl on the rideshare which I was taking from ottawa to montreal told me about this restaurant and insisted that I would have to try it. And I did go there with my buddy in Montreal, who was also first time going to this place. He was in the restaurant business and has been manager for several well known brands in the area. So he had high standard when it comes to fine food. After the dinner, he simply said \"amazing\" and that what it meant happiness to him.  For me, I ordered \"duck in a can\" and IT WAS AN ART. Very creative dish, from the way it was prepared, cooked, and served to the way it tastes. Simply amazing dish. I also had the squid ink poutine for the appetizer and that was yummy as well, although not as unique as the duck in a can (well, not many dishes in the world would be that unique anyways).  If I'm going to rate this restaurant based on the Michelin star standards for the food quality (yeah and I mean the food quality only, screw the formality criteria), this place would be \"4\" stars.  One advice when you go there though:  if you are not going in a big group, sit at the bar. You will be able to see the whole crew in the kitchen preparing the food. And that is very entertaining to watch."}
{"text":"Yet another recommendation from Doctor Elsie W., and I am so glad that we came here. Oh, you STILL haven't read LifeOnMacro yet? Here: http://lifeonmacro.com/2015/12/09/travelogue-montreal-part-trois-sept-2015/. You're very welcome.  Food: I recommend the catfish fritters for appetizer. I ordered the happy pork chop but my wife ordered the special pasta, which really stood out. It was made with pesto and other sauces, but thereafter, the server put together the dish on top of a huge block of cheese. By adding a bit of hot water, part of the cheese melted into the pasta before it was plated. This was the special of the day and it was absolutely delicious. I was tempted to order the other specials and should have, but did not. I will next time. DO NOT SKIP DESSERT! We had the flaky hot pecan pie a la mode. We have not found a better pecan pie anywhere else, ever. The ice cream was freshly made in the machine behind us!! The price for all this appeared extremely reasonable to me, though I guess everything in New York City is inflated for no good reason.  Service: among the greatest I've ever experienced in all of Montreal. The servers all anticipated our needs - the water was continuously refilled and our bread was always plentiful. The server appeared cheerful, too. Relatively rare in Montreal.  Americans, please note: dinners in Montreal may take three hours, and that's okay. Per Doctor Elsie W.'s point: just accept the fact that this is the case. Chefs obviously take extreme pride in their cooking, and a perfect product takes time. Please try not to complain about the speed of food service and try to accept this new culture/environment you're in. It's evening time in Montreal, there aren't too many other places to rush off to anyway =).  Tip: parking in this area can prove extremely challenging! Good luck!"}
{"text":"It is expensive.  So cheapoes go else where.  That said...  Service is excellent.  Food is excellent (the foie gras poutine isn't worth it).  Reservations are a must weeks in advanced.  The place is so beloved that everyone in the city knows \"PDC\" stands for \"Au Pied de Cochon\"."}
{"text":"Please refer to my photographs. The most decadent meal of my life. We ate an absurd amount of food because we had to try as much as we could!   Onion soup gratinee. The PDC twist? Ham in the soup. So good.  Blue cheese, apple and lettuces salad. Very fresh and a wonderful blend of sweet and tart.   Two, count them, TWO foie gras dishes: foie gras poutine (glad I tried it but I learned there is such a thing as too much foie gras) and another foie gras masterpiece (cannot recall the name), a perfectly seared piece of foie gras on top of a piece of ham blanketed by melted cheese, doused with maple syrup. Sounds weird, tastes amazing.   PDC Melting Pot: two types of sausage and pork shoulder atop mashed potatoes and a couple other vegetables. Who really cares about the vegetables, this restaurant is called The Pig's Foot for God's sake! This dish was so tasty.  Dark chocolate pot de creme which arrived in a weird, very rustic jar. A perfect ending to an absurdly rich, delightful meal.   Loud, vibrant, unpretentious atmosphere, friendly service. Great fun, great food. Definitely coming back one day."}
{"text":"This place is crowded, noisy, no atmosphere. The waiters kept trying to squeeze in the tight space between my chair and the chair of the lady in the next table, and it made enjoying our meals in peace really difficult. There are only 2 single washrooms, one for woman, & one for man. I had to wait behind 2 other men, and about 10 minutes to use the washroom. The food is so so, nothing to get excited about. I really think this place is overrated. We tried the tartar bison, the stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras, the bison is okay, the pied de cochon was too spicy & overlooked."}
{"text":"If you haven't already been to the pied de cochon cabane a sucre then you must try it at least once in your life!  This is no ordinary cabane a sucre. In order for one to be ready to try this ultimate foodie experience, I strongly suggest not eating a day before as food is in abundance. The cabane does offer take home containers which is great. Located in Mirabel ..it is located in a remote area and very picturesque. Once seated inside the cozy cabane, the friendly and well organized staff will commence to bring out the wonderful eye catching dishes. I would strongly recommend ordering the tortierre...simply delicious!  This year the cabane had an asian theme which was very good and different!  Martin Picard is a true culinary masterchef with his unique flavors and plate presentations. You must try this experience at least once!"}
{"text":"A bite from our full review -  \"Our waiter came with a small mezzaluna and cut up the pizza swiftly in front of us making for a great presentation. The portion was not too big, but very succulent. We felt an explosion of taste with sweet maple syrup drizzled on top, smoked meats and fresh mozzarella which felt a bit like ricotta instead.\""}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about their duck in a can dish.  However we got side tracked last night with the lobster roll special with slices of fois gras.   When we suggested we order both the lobster roll and the duck in a can, our waiter suggested we wait. The portion was so huge, especially after two starters, we doggie bagged 1/3 of the roll so that we would have room for their lemon tart.  Definitely one of the best lemon tarts in the world!!!  The lemon curd is not too sweet, perfect crust and meringue lightly torched.The restaurant is packed even after 10:30PM. Most of the wait staff is young, but the service is attentive and friendly. We sat at the bar which allowed us to watch some of the dishes being prepped.  If you love gluttony this restaurant is not to be missed."}
{"text":"First of all, I have to say I've been using yelp for a long time and have never really been compelled to write a review until now. My friends took me here as part of my bachelor party weekend in Montreal, and this was easily the highlight of the trip for all of us.  While we had some issues with our reservation in the beginning, and the hostess was extremely rude, this was more than offset by the service at the table, which was friendly and very quick. I'm not going to go into too much detail about the food because I think the other reviews speak for themselves, but I'm just going to say flat-out that this was the best meal of my life (and all of my friends felt the same way).  I had the Poutine au foie gras and the classic Canard en conserve (Duck in a can), followed by the Pouding chÃ´meur for dessert. Most of us ordered different entrees, but we were all in agreement that the Duck in a can was second to none. Very indulgent and fatty food but an unforgettable experience. All in all, this meal was an epic win, and I would come back to Montreal just for this."}
{"text":"Ok, believe some of the hype....APC is very, very good.  But not everything was perfect.  I went here two weeks ago for the first time with a buddy of mine while on a motorcycle trip.  The standout of the meal was the bison rib chop that he ordered.  Truly amazing.  My pork chop?  Not so much....I make better myself at home.   For starters we had the APC \"salad\" (stupid me didn't realize this was simply a series of meats...very good....but too much given what was to come after).  I believe they had a fried cod special app that we tried that was excellent and fairly light. We also had one of their foie gras dishes, simply prepared, and that was excellent too.  We killed two bottles of wine from the northern Rhone.  The first white I ordered they were out of so we started with a white St. Joseph (either rousanne or marsanne, if you like those varietals...I do) then moved on to a red St. Joseph (mostly Syrah).  These were both outstanding and you could spend a long time studying their wine list.  The staff was very attentive and it was packed on the Wed night we went with a small line out the door.  We took a long, slow, half hour+ walk back to our hotel after this meal and that was the right call.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying more items from the menu.  Just don't you dare forget to order that rib chop!  You can cut it with a fork...  Lastly, I think most of their prices are very reasonable.  Some are outright screaming buys.  So, good value overall for this type of place.  Make sure to put your reservation in at least a month in advance.  Damn, we never did find out who that hot redhead was at the bar...."}
{"text":"PROS:  1. The food is rich, succulent, and an experience. The memorable dishes were: the Foie Gras Comesquis which are basically fried balls of foie gras that explode (literally) in your mouth. If you like foie gras, this is the starter for you!   Second: the Plogue a Champlain. This was probably my favorite thing we tried. The sweetness of the maple syrup and the saltiness of foie gras and meat all combined was to die for!   2. The decor suits the food (warm/rich) and I liked how you could see the kitchen from the dining area.   3. Service was classy and they recommended great dishes for us. However, the restaurant made my reservation on the wrong day. So we showed up and were told it was a no-go but since I did make the reservation and swore I made it the right day, they gave us a table. phew!  CONS:  1. It's quite pricey but in this case, you get what you pay for :) !  2. You need to make reservations like a week in advance.   OVERALL: -It's a great place for foie gras and to indulge in outrageously heavy, rich, delightful food.  -It's a place to go at least once. I don't think I will go again just because I'm not THAT big a fan of foie gras."}
{"text":"Came here on our first night in Montreal and we were not disappointed. I was able to book an online reservation for 2 about a week in advance. Would definitely recommend making a reservation as people were still waiting to be seated by the time we finished our dinner at around 11p.  Food - We ordered the foie cromesquis, foie gras pizza, foie gras poutine and duck in a can. Loved the cromesquis (if you order, wait at least 30 seconds before eating as the inside filling is HOT) as they were juicy and flavorful. Don't want to be inappropriate here, but make sure you eat them in one big bite because the filling bursts in your mouth (please get your mind out of the gutter). The foie gras pizza was great with small chunks of foie that wasn't too heavy and fresh cheese. The poutine was also delicious and we finished the entire plate. The only mild disappointment was the duck in a can. The presentation was unique and memorable, but as a dish I thought it was only okay. It was very heavy and the flavor didn't wow me in any way.   Ambience - very loud! I could barely hear my hubs so it was really hard to hold a conversation.   Overall, I would recommend a visit and would come again to try more of the pork dishes for the entree."}
{"text":"This might be one of my favorite restaurants in the world. I'm never disappointed and always amazed. Their special this week: pork chop cut up on top of mopo tofu. Already I'm thinking non asian trying to pull off an asian dish cause I'm an dck. But jokes on me cause that mo mo po po taste as good if not better than the real deal. The whole dish just worked. Shame on me...  Always. Always. I don't care if you like or don't like duck liver, always order the froie gras poutine."}
{"text":"Great place with a stellar ambiance in the heart of plateau mont-royal. An extensive wine list. French bread to die for. Great service and delicious eats."}
{"text":"Mon cher ami, Philippe, m'a dit que Au Pied de Cochon est son restaurant favori a Quebec! Heureusement, nous avons fait une reservation dans les Etats Unis une mois prochaine parce que c'etait plein des personnes.  Ok, j'ai mange le pied de cochon et elle a mange quelque chose avec canard. Les deux sont tres delicieuse. Mais le pied de cochon etait un peu grasse mais est pied de cochon!  J'aimerais bien le service (les serveurs sont gentils et attentis) et especialment l'ambiance du restaurant!   Bien sure, je vais revenir Au Pied de Cochon la prochaine fois je voyage a Montreal.

{"text":"Gluttony at its finest. You will feel like one of those poor ducks being stuffed with food, who knows you may be on the menu next (jk). Everything there is great. This is one of Montreal's finest dining establishments."}
{"text":"If you are on a strict diet, don't bother to come here. You'll either be revolted out of your mind, or cave in and binge like you have never binged before.  Waited 30 minutes past my set reservation time, hence 1 star off.  The service - aside from the wait - was very good. The waiter was very attentive and helpful the entire evening.  The food here is very rich. The fries are great and the foie gras poutine was very hearty. I could have stopped at that. We ordered a salad to try to 'be good' but in retrospect that could have been skipped because it just took up a spot on the table that could have been filled with another fatty food dish that is their specialty.   We got the duck in a can to see the hype in real life. To me, it looked really disgusting watching it plop out of the can into the dish. But it smelled good, and knowing what it was, I was excited to try it. It was very tender and delicious. Yum. We also go the Pied de Cochon since that's what the restaurant is called. That was a HUGE heaping dish. I could barely eat by then and could only pick at the potatoes and parts of it. One of us got the horse tartar that was on special. I didn't try it since I did't feel like eating my little pony's cousin but apparently it was good.  The table next to us had the pig head. It had a candy cane jammed up its nose hole and a knife in its head. So revolting, yet that looked good too. There was no way, we were too full.  We wanted dessert. I wanted the maple milk shake and pot de creme and lemon pie. But there just was no physical way to consume that much so we had to skip it.  Serving sizes are huge. Take the leftovers home. You can't let this kind of food go to waste.  The food was just so decadent and rich. So fatty and full of salt. We felt like 300lb pot-bellied men stuffing our faces for the winter hibernation. Don't worry, you can exercise purge after."}
{"text":"A reservation is needed here! Even with a reservation, be expected to wait if you're dining in during the weekend. The restaurant had a working kitchen that you can see and also a view of all the different seafoods such as oysters. The entire menu is in French so we had the waitress translate the menu for us. It was packed to the fullest and literally, you are on top of everyone when sitting. No personal space really but they moved us to a more open space in the back of the restaurant.  The food here was delicious! We ordered the cromesquis de fois grau and it was delicious! I couldn't believe how flavorful it was in a single bite. The staff was amazing and very friendly here. They offered us a complimentary assortment of meats for the long wait. I tried the duck in a can and it tasted so good and so rich. It's definitely a unique presentation, something I haven't seen before."}
{"text":"Place to go for authentic French cuisine, a great atmosphere, and delicious food. Went and celebrated an occasion with my brother and some friends and were greeted by friendly staff, quick service and foie gras everything. Fair value for the big sized portions and would recommend the venison, duck in a can, or lobster foie gras. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5 stars I would, but our experience was not a 4.  The space is tight, but not terrible or a turn-off.  The servers were not the nicest or most helpful of our trip.  The open kitchen is cool but also adds to the already crazy amount of noise in the dinning room.  We started by trying to order wine, but the waitress was not very helpful or interested in making recommendations.  Also, all of the reds were served chilled, which we were not fans of.  The beer selection is OK, but non of the brews are that great.  The single dish that was the best of our trip and bumped up this place's total rating was the onion soup.  The was piping hot, super flavorful with lots of soft onions and huge chunks of bacon.  The broth was the best onion soup broth we have ever had.  The melted cheese and bread chunks were also an added bonus.  After this starter, our hopes were super high.  Unfortunately, two dishes we were interested in ordering, the Happy Pork Chop and the PDC Cut were both out.  It was Friday at 6pm - how are you out?!  My wife settled for the Duck Margret which was a medium (she would have preferred more rare) cooked breast with a wine and mushroom sauce.  She said it was just OK, and after I tasted it I agreed.  Not bad, not good, nothing special.    My meal was much better.  I had the special: table side risotto, made INSIDE a huge Parmesan wheel, with peas and chunks of bacon.  It was very cheesy and delicious, but made table side also meant it was not tasted or flavored or seasoned as well as it could have been.  It was very good, but could have been better.  After the amazing soup, the rest of the meal and service was a let down.  We expected so much coming in but left disappointed, which is a shame because it wasn't a bad meal but it also wasn't a great meal."}
{"text":"What i am about to describe is what makes this place more than just a restaurant, but in the company of good friends. My girlfriend and I came here and we had 7:30 reservations. We got there about 5-10 minutes early, but our table was not ready so we sat at the bar.  We ordered our wine and looked at the menu, deciding what we were going to eat. We had alot of questions and the wait staff was very happy to answer all of them. We were doing well, when i realized we had been sitting at the bar for half an hour with our table still not ready. Because of that they gave us a complimentary order of their fois gras croquettes (amazing one bite little morsel). Finally our table was ready and we sat. We knew what we had wanted so we ordered right away. I wanted the stuffed pig foot, and out waitress told us that it would take 45 minutes to prepare so we should order and appetizer if we were hungry. So we ordered the fois gras poutine. When the poutine arrived my jaw dropped. It was divine. But after we finished the poutine we waited....and waited...and waited for 1.5 hours for our food to arrive.  We were getting a little impatient. But it was worth it. Keep in mind....the pigs foot can feed probably 4 people. It is the single most decadent dinner i have ever had. It is an arms length worth of fried boneless pork leg, on top of a mashed potato mixed with cheese (so stretchy) amd mushroom sauce. And for the cherry intop of it all...100 grams of more fois. I have reached my fois quota for the next 5 years. Of course i didnt finish it...it was massive. It comes in its own 18 inch casserole. That is how its plated! So once we boxed up our food we asked for the check. Our waitress comes back not only with our check, but two glasses and a bottle of calvados. She said that die to our really long wait for our table and oir food not only would be get complimentary calvados, but the poutine would be taken off the bill. They even offered to throw in a dessert (but we were way to full). THIS IS SERVICE!!!! They knew they were running behind, were incredibly apologetic (wait staff, hostess, general manager) and were very accommodating. Thank you so much for taking care of us. Chef Piccard you have a great team here."}
{"text":"Yum!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious. Hands down a 5. The food is soooo good. The menu isn't very descriptive but it doesn't need to be the food speaks for itself. The service was fantastic also. We shared the veal, duck in a can, tartare and boar rib - wow. Duck in a can is quite an experience haha they just open the can of their duck breast with foie gras and this delicious sauce and pour it over cauliflower purÃ©e.. I mean there are just no words honestly. The veal was probably my favorite it was seasoned to perfection. They also just opened a food truck so keep an eye out for that one.   If you are in Montreal you absolutely cannot miss this one."}
{"text":"Very, very good. We managed to get a last minute reservation through our hotel (the wonderful Hotel Nelligan!)- we had tried calling ourselves but you have to leave a message and they call you back. We never got a call back. Call early if you know you want to go here on your next visit to Montreal!  We started with the Foie Gras Poutine and I had the tart with foie gras and blood sausage. The poutine was good, your average poutine but the foie gras slices were large and plentiful! I didn't mind that the foie gras was in large somewhat gelatinous slices on top, but I could see how poutine traditionalists would be turned off by it. The tart was good as well and I couldn't believe the amount of foie gras and blood sausage for 28! Plus the tart itself was enormous! It was good, a bit soggy at the bottom, but good nonetheless. The foie gras, which I had a lot of, was good, but not the best I've ever had, which was somewhat disappointing after all the hype of this place.   Everything was very rich and so with the big portions it was hard to finish - but no complaints about that! The service was very attentive (for the ladies - it seemed like only handsome hipster waiters worked there - nice!). The atmosphere is casual but upscale casual, it draws a very hipster/cool crowd."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service; could not have asked for a better dining experience. Everyone and everything at Au Pied was perfect. The only bad part of the whole experience was that I didn't have room for dessert...  MUST ORDER: Charcuterie from Sugar Shack. It really doesn't get any better or fresher than this. The meats are sliced table side, drizzled with olive oil and served with a maple fritter.   MUST TRY: Stuffed Pork Shank w/ Foie Gras and Mashed Potatoes. Super rich, fatty dish that will put you over the top and in a coma. A tad on the salty side but still very tasty. Definitely not for the faint of heart. I recommend this dish if you have 3+ people to share with.   Highly recommend snacking or dining here!"}
{"text":"Early arrival due to my Friend's efforted reservations, a story best left for her to tell. Even with plentiful choices of Quebecois dining, APdC is on everyone's Travel Guide.  Start ------- Early on, the tables were evenly spaced comfortable as we arrived to the table. A staff balanced the table as another came to offer the Menu.  So far so good. We chose our bevs of choice as the server explained the Off-Menu Daily Offers. Fast & Furious did he shoot out the long listing.  Also what's not on Menu tonight. My Friend looks as blank as a cloud.  Huh?  Cromesquis de Foie Gras($3.50)  When the plate was served, we were given instructions for the minute wait. Hot greasy explosions in ones mouth is a lawsuit waiting to happen I bet. Little did our server factor-in my background of near-boiling point consumption. One-minute on the GSHOCK and the Cromesquis was lukewarm. Flavour and Texture of breading... lukewarm grease coats the Tongue.  Cerveau de Veau + Boulettes de Viande de Veau [Daily Offer]  Floured, fried and seasoned(lightly) on the delicate smooth Tofu-like Veal Brain. The lone Veal Meatball was done very nicely as your Italian Mama likes it. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try Veal Brain for the first time.  Merci APdC.  Intermission ---------------- Tables fill up around us with Families no less, quite obviously Tourists. A couple guys get their Tete de Cochon pour 2 as everyone ooh aahs in amaze. Where shall our Mains be? As I look out to see Martin Picard bringing Meats inside. Maybe we should have ordered more Apps & Beers if we knew there was downtime.  Pied de Cochon($22.00)  A MASSIVE slab of roasted blubbery Pork Hock Skin dominates most of the plate. Underneath lies Meat the likes of Chinese Soup Meat, flavourless bordering dry. Magic is in the Onion/Rosemary Sauce which at least they're not afraid to season. Fridge-time at home allowed the Meat/Sauce to consult for much better flavours.  Poutine au Foie Gras($23.00)  A Value-added Poutine that is meant for the experienced Foie Gras Eater. Crispy Fries, thick rich but overly salty Gravy, Squeaky Curds and plenty of FOIE. Reason why Foie Gras Rookies should avoid this dish as their First experience? The Foie Gras and rich Gravy/Curd has similar consistency and flavours. The Gravy/Curd covers up the Foie Gras and vice versa.  Novelty Dish.  End ----- By 2-hours, all Tables occupied and breath gets thin in a bustling APdC. Maitre'd almost tackled me as I attempt to locate my Jacket at the rack. My Friend awaits the Waiters to free up to notice our attempt to leave asap.  Conclusion - Worth a visit.   --------------- 1. Unique Dishes  2. Good Value  3. Enough Cholesterol for a Month"}
{"text":"Excellent food.   I had the Boudin, the poutine with foie gras and white gravy, and the tartare made into a maki roll.  My mom had the lobster and veg (really good) the wife had Alex chop but I didn't have any.  The fries here (what my son had) are great too.    Oh and I can't. Forget the house blonde beer.  The one thing I didn't like was the noise level.  I came here with my wife, mom and two kids (3 years and my 10 month old daughter). I know it isn't exactly a family place, but they were very welcoming and  accommodating.  The noise just reminded me of the cafeteria in grammar school, loud chatter.  It wasn't all that bad, but my son wasn't all that happy with it and my mom and wife were more annoyed than they should have been.  The atmosphere was also pleasant despite the noise.  The staff was nice and as I said, welcoming of a family with kids which is always nice."}
{"text":"This place is a foie gras paradise. Even though I thought they'd have to cart me home after eating here, it ended up being that it is rich in the most perfect and balanced way.  We ordered the foie gras crosmequis (or croquettes), the foie gras poutine, and the famous duck in a can.  The crosmequis - two tiny one bite croquettes - just exploded with rich melty flavor in your mouth. Amazing start to our meal. At only $3.50 you should def make sure to try this - I promise you'll be tempted to order more.  The foie gras poutine - I thought the foie gras would be way too much on such a rich dish, but it melded so well with the cheese/gravy and added a delicious extra layer of flavor.  The duck in a can - this was intense. The presentation was amazing (the waiter brings a can opener to the table, opens up the cutely branded can, and pours out the contents on a giant plate). The duck was almost steak like, something I wasn't expecting, but which proved to be a great balance to the creamy texture of the foie gras. The vegetable broth had amazing flavor, although it was very soft, almost mushy. Make sure you pick out the garlic cloves though - these were delicious. Overall, really original (both flavor and presentation) and worth the high price tag.  Other notes: *the dark chocolate pot de creme we had for dessert was another winner. *try the house brew - I want to say its pilsner style, really good complement to their food. *even though our server was slammed (seems common in Montreal, even in higher end restaurants), he spent time helping us understand the menu and overall gave excellent service - and even snapped a photo of us at the end of our meal!  I think this was the stand out meal on my visit to Montreal - which is saying a lot in a city brimming with amazing food options. Ill be dreaming about this meal until my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"I read the reviews of this place and almost didn't go. That would've been a HUGE mistake. The short version is, our waiter was nice, patient, explained the menu and specials multiple times, and spoke very good English. I got the duck confit and seared duck breast. It was AMAZING as was the Poutine Foie Gras.  My friend got the shepherd's pie, it was really good. And the beef tartare was good, but overwhelming for one person.  As for the Melting Pot... just pass on this dish.  Overall it was a really good experience and not as expensive as others would have you believe. But to be fair, we could only get a reservation for 5 PM (opening), which I believe played in our favor with the service. And it took three days and three phone calls to get that reservation. Minor inconveniences, but well worth it."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Au Pied de Cochon. It is a staple in Mtl that you have to try once. I came with two people for late night dinner and we shared the quenelle and the duck in a can. The quenelle was very sweet and there were three small pieces of lobster and no mussels. The sweetness was overwhelming. The duck in a can was good but there was a big piece of duck fat. Since we shared this dish, we each had a small piece of duck meat. The duck meat itself was very tasty and perfectly cooked. The sweetness of the other dish overpowered everything so it made it hard to enjoy anything else. The service - the waiter did not come to see us aside from taking our order.  It was an ok experience overall."}
{"text":"Amazing staff that went out of their way to make sure I got a vegetarian meal made for me. The process of them making my mushroom risotto was spectacular!"}
{"text":"I am judging overall as a meal and the service. First off, the place doesnt have a banner so it is difficult to spot if you dont know where it is.   Foie gras poutine. Very good, the foie gras melted in with the poutine and you were able to taste the foie gras. The texture or the plate was consistant, there was cheesy, crispy and then the foie gras made it very good. you were able to taste that the fries were fried in the duck fat and the gravy was creamy and rich. with that being said, a very good dish but will get heavy and sickening after you eat too much of it.  Foie gras a la champlain. foie gras on top of a thick slice of bacon, on a bed of thin crispy potato pancake (like a thin hashbrown), topped with a generous amount of maple syrup sauce. First bite was veryyyyy good!! So cripsy from the potato, the bacon was thick and the foie gras was enhanced in this plate, the maple syrup sauce was a good amount of sweet and salty. But this is definitely not a plate you eat on your own, its best for sharing because after a while the taste and maple syrup is quite overwhelming.   table side Squash risotto. risotto was cooked very well but since it was table side she made it in the a large parmesan cheese, mixed it all together. She over poured the chicken broth and the risotto became a soup.   The waiter asked how it was and I told him honestly that I did not like it because it was too watery. He left then about 3-4 mins later he asked me \"do you want me to take it to the chef to try it\", well no obviously not! She should have known when she served it because it was clearly too watery. He knew I was unhappy and he was the one that was pushing for this squash risotto, he didnt do anything to make up for the bad dish. At a resto like that I would expect so much more.   Overall, theres definitely better. I'm glad I tried it but I would not be returning."}
{"text":"I feel terrible saying this, but this did not live up to the hype. The foie gras poutine was OK, good sauce, except the liver didn't seem to be fully cooked (at least not compared to the foie gras I had before in Quebec.) The beignet was good, the homemade iced tea excellent. Still the poutine should have been the star of the show."}
{"text":"Outstanding but not fussy food in a cool, casual place that serves the best foie gras and pork -- what more do you need?   I absolutely love this place!    I came here with some of my closest friends and we had an absolute blast.  One of my friends is \"usually\" a vegetarian but made an exception for the incredible duck in a can -- you cannot miss this!  They had just ran out of the last Pig's Head, so we also got the Happy Pork Chop (with a name like that, how could you not?) -- and needless to say, I was quite happy with my choice.  The flavors of the mushrooms and onions paired quite well with the thick pork chop.    I didn't get to try the foie gras poutine, but I'll definitely be back!  I will make a flight out to Montreal to have another phenomenal meal here!"}
{"text":"Most of what's been said about this place being proudly gluttonous is spot on. If you can embrace it for what it is, you're sure to enjoy it. This is a celebration of meat, and organ meat, and fat, and foie gras, and more meat-and the amazing things they create with them. This isn't delicate, subtle French dining. This is an unabashed, indulgent carnivore celebration.   There wasn't a bad thing we tried. A tuna tartare appetizer was fantastic, as was the Duck Carpaccio. Poutine Foie Gras was a thing to behold. Probably the best poutine I've had, but it was too much for 2 people to split, IMO. You have to really love Foie Gras, but if you do, it's incredibly generous in that dish for the price, and it's melt-in-your-mouth tender (the way it should be).  Service was very good as well."}
{"text":"The famed Au Pied de Cochon.  Seeing it on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations has made it a mecca for foodies, specifically for the numerous foie gras dishes and the canard in a can.  So lets get down to it.  The place was packed, make reservations in advance via email. Wine list is impressive, but go for their house blonde draft.  It's refreshing and crisp.  Perfect for cutting through the richness of the food.  Started with the pate du campagne and the PDC salad.   The salad was excellent, nicely cooked offals over a bed of greens.  The pate was good, very rustic.  For entrÃ©es, the boudin and foie tart and the PDC pot. The tart was rich, decadent, unctuous... take your pick. The pot was great, several sausages and different meats served in a cast iron pot. Service was good, our server and busser were very friendly. If you were looking for great Quebecois cuisine, this is it."}
{"text":"Everyone kept talking about this place, good and bad, so decided I should try it out.   A lot of the locals told me it was okay, and the non-locals said it was a 5 star must go to because of A. Bourdain's strong highly recommended review.  Made a reservation, took a minute finding it, and wasn't sure if I liked the decor once inside. Its a very small, cramped restaurant, with not so friendly waiters. Don't even get me started on the Chef.   Had 3 other people with me and one who had special dietary requests for extreme health reasons, and I of course still \"pescatarian.\" And yes, I knew this was the place for a carnivore, I read the Au Pied De Cochon Recipe book & did my research before hand, so I wasn't in shock or being difficult.   My guests ordered:  Foie Gras Hamburger  Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras Fries (in duck fat) and I ordered the Salmon Pie (something like that, seasonal)  If you're wondering what the other person's order was, it was nothing, because of his special dietary requirements. The Chef was SOOOOOO NOT willing to make him anything plain without sauce. So he sat there, and stared, not a bite to eat, which ended up being better.  Yeah, I get it, its the Chef's kitchen, and menu, but still, really!??!   Anyway.  The food we did order came and stayed. None of us were pleased, everything was in Duck Fat, so everything was SOOOOOO salty and drenched in sauce. We had such high hopes, and were saddened by the lack of deliciousness. No one did any damage to their meals, and we all left hungry.  They didn't even do their burger right, according to the person who ordered it. My Salmon Pie was worse than a microwaveable, boxed Banquet pie.   This place encouraged me to learn how to make my own Salmon Pot Pie and non cooked in Duck Fat French Fries."}
{"text":"I had such an interesting experience dining here. My friends and I called in early asking about whether or not we needed to make reservations and we were told that we didn't because there was a lot of space. When we got to the restaurant, we were turned away because we supposedly had to make reservations days in advance? It was honestly just a really nasty experience because the waitress aggressively told us that we had no idea what we were talking about. It was just generally a very disappointing first interaction for a place that's rated so highly on a lot of food blogs about Montreal.  That being said though, we were determined to give this place a shot. We got a bit luckier the next day and opted ot have an insanely early dinner. We managed to get seated pretty quickly which was nice, and we ordered four different dishes: the poutine (of course), something... with fois gras, the melting pot, and duck in mushroom sauce  Poutine was so solid. This was my first experience having poutine in Montreal which apparently is a big thing for the Canadians or something. But since I haven't had any other type of poutine, I'm not exactly the best reviewer of whether or not this poutine was worth it. It was definitely very delicious though!  I'm not sure what the special was that day but it did have foi gras and it was this strange pancake like thing but... with duck? I really don't know, but I've always been a proponent of the magic of specials so I would just say that you should always order the special because it's a special for a reason right?  The melting pot was the other thing that was spoken very highly of on food blogs and was definitely an interesting one.   I guess all in all, it wasn't that the food was bad, but it wasn't really anything mindblowing. I guess the special was moderately mindblowing, but everything else was good but nothing too special .  tldr; a bit overhyped in all honesty... not a bad experience though"}
{"text":"It was really good comfort food, everything incorporated with foie gras which I am a huge fan of, the cranberry goat cheese foie gras and the foie gras poutine is a must order. The duck appetizer was very good as well."}
{"text":"Even Alan Richman has good words for this place so I consider this a must-try restaurant in Montreal. Our friends here told us how heavenly it is but also warned us it could be overly rich. We however, went against the advice and ordered a whole table of entrees with great ambition to conquer them all.   We started with the cod fish fritters to share. It somehow tasted like Chinese fish paste deep fried. The cod fish is grounded up with seasoning so it is nothing like a fish n chip if that is what you were thinking. It is crispy and tasty.   Then we proceeded with PCD Crispy salad and it comes with a few lettuce but is laden with fried cartilage and crispy pork meat. The flavor and most importantly, fat makes the dish undeniable and delicious. We swept the whole dish within minutes. We also got an order of Bison Tongue and that is definitely the most delicious tongue I have ever encountered. I know tongue sounds frightening but in reality it is so tender and it soaked up all the sauces. We declared it a must try here.   Here, we arrived at the most important moment of our meal at PCD. We patiently awaited the duck in a can. Then, the waiter brought us the famous can with cooked duck, gravy and fois gras over bed of bread and cheese. We watched him open the can and pour the wonder over the plate and we were astonished in awe. It was truly a magic plate. The duck breast was so tender and flavorful. The bread was soaked in the gravy within seconds and cheese melted to add more flavor. I had one piece and then another.   Then, the 2nd entree arrived, the glorious \"Pied De Cochon\", aka pig knuckles or pig feet so to speak. Chinese love pig knuckles so I was excited to see how they prepare this dish. To my surprise, when the dish arrived I could not even see them. They were buried deeply underneath tons of cheese gravy sauce. The best part about pig knuckle is actually the skin and they cooked it right alright. It was chewy and tender at the same time. The meat is so tender and about to fall aprt. The sauce makes the dish so rich and delicious I think I reached my cholestrol capacity after two bites.   I started to regret there is another entree coming. My stomach is already protesting. So we still have the blood sausage boutin tart left. I know we won't even be able to finish them all. Then the dish arrived with pikes of cut blood sausage with again gravy on top of a buttery crust. I managed to try a small slice and declared I am done for the night. It was very good but I was not a big fan of blood sausage. But everyone really enjoyed the dish as well.   I think for 4 people, 2 entrees will be plenty to share along with the appetizers. I will not be able to return for a long while so my stomach could get detox."}
{"text":"OH my god i'm so full. Plug of champagne. Pot of sausage. Blue salad. Whissskey. Michel Couvreur Intravagan'za.  this is the draft review I found in my phone. I will keep it."}
{"text":"The food is extremely rich. I didn't completely love my experience but it could have been due to exhaustion from lack of sleep and waiting to be seated (despite 9:30 reservations). We were also seated next to the wine cellar and it was freezing!  Foie gras poutine - smothered in gravy and mixed with foie gras. This was decadent and tasty.  Duck carpaccio - just okay..  nothing to write home about  Cochonnailles Platter - definitely my favorite! Nice variety of pates and sausages to try.  Tuna tartare - Good but not a must try. You can get this elsewhere.   Happy pork chop -this was devoured within minutes. Normal size portions for an entree. May not be the best for sharing.  Bison tartare - worth trying. I liked it. I'm not crazy about non-fish tartare but this was good.   Guinea hen for 2 - very tasty! The white meat was moist and the guinea hen sat in the sauce that came w/ the happy pork chop. My only gripe was the parsley. Too much!  Bill came out to be 40 per person after taxes and tips. For the amount of food, it was worth it. Would I come back? Probably not. There are so many other restaurants to try in Montreal."}
{"text":"I had one of the great meals of my life here.  Spectacular Moules-frites, an entree of duck and chicken confit with blood sausage, and a mini cinnamon cake for dessert.  Espresso and molasses porter.   I've woken up heartbroken from dreams about this kitchen.  Montreal is an amazing city, but this restaurant alone is worth a cross country trip for."}
{"text":"Having read the rave reviews about  Au Pied de Cochon,I had high expectations before I even arrived. I`m pleased to say they weren't only met, they were exceeded! The atmosphere was lovely, the service fantastic and the food incredible. Five stars!  To start, my friend and I shared the snails and the salami tray. I have to say the thought of eating snails grossed me out, but I reluctantly tried them. They were delicious. The brandy and BBQ in the sauce made the dish. The salami tray was predictably scrumptious.  For my \"high gear\", I had the duck carpaccio This was possibly the best duck I've ever had. Even if you're not a huge duck  fan, I still think you should try it. The cream sauce drizzled over it was fantastic.   I almost forgot to share my cocktail experience. You must get the Pom Pom! It`s got pomegranate juice, ginger and mint, to name a few ingredients. I also tried the Rosemary Pink Diamond Fuzz which was also very good. I had a sip of the Blue Mojito, but it was too sweet for my liking.  Simply put, Au Pied de Cochon is superb. I can`t wait to go back."}
{"text":"Another montreal rec from katie j. We e-mailed them a month prior and got a reservation for 7:30pm on a Tuesday night. Even though it was a random weeknight, the restaurant was packed, and people were waiting for tables outside. The atmosphere was warm and casual. We were seated at a table by the floor to ceiling windows which were left open due to the lovely weather.  The food was amazing - rich and flavorful. I'd especially recommend the bison tongue (wonderfully tender texture) and the duck in a can (rich, but don't be afraid to try it!). The foie gras poutine was too much for me, but hubby loved the seared foie gras. The wine recommendations from the waiter were spot on.   We were too full for dessert, but if we're ever in Montreal again, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Au Pied du Cochon. I'd even go as far as recommending it to anyone visiting Montreal. I don't regret eating there - but I wouldn't be upset if I never ate there again.  Au Pied du Cochon is a culinary experience unlike any I've ever had. I'm not sure it's counterpart exists in the US. It's pure gluttony. The menu doesn't have much finesse - it punches you in the face with flavor and foie. I enjoyed every dish we had, but wouldn't rave about any of them. The duck in a can was good, the duck carpaccio was better, the tuna belly was tasty, but none of it blew me away. Most tasted good for a bite or two, and then wore me down with its richness. Especially the beef osso buco, which was the thickest osso buco I've ever tasted.   I enjoyed eating at APdC. It's an experience worth having while in Montreal. The service and ambiance are awesome. But would I put in the same sentence as Joe Beef? No, definitely not. You want to eat at Joe Beef every weekend - you want to eat at APdC once, and then go hibernate for a year."}
{"text":"A great spot for foie gras prepared in many different ways. Seared is my favorite version. Their tuna belly with Foie gras was the best! Extra fatty and delicious on top of a rock salt that me and my friends thought was part of the fish lol  The poutine foie gras is a must have there!"}
{"text":"I must give great thanks to my friend Mike, who made this experience possible. Going to Montreal has been one my best experiences in life thus far. APC was just amaaazing. My first time having foie gras and it was delicious. I wish that I had been more adventurous and gotten the duck in a can, however my wallet was doing the thinking so I ordered the steak frites, which as good. My friend ordered the Melting Pot which had close to everything but the oink of the pig and he was in Hog Heaven. My other friend had the duck breast in red wine I believe, and he thoroughly enjoyed his plate. I thoroughly enjoyed nibbling from both plates, though I stayed away from the blood sausage in the melting pot.   What really got me though was the desert, gosh that was heaven. We ordered the Pouding Chomeur (Poor Man's Pudding) was heaven, like eating a cloud, I'm in love. Topping off an already ridiculously good dinner."}
{"text":"Called here to make a reservation and glad we did because this place was packed and now I see why. The foie gras here is better than Daniel's in NYC and reasonably priced as well. So here's what we've tried:   We were going to try the Poutine au foie gras for appetizer like everyone else, but our waiter highly recommended the Plogue Ã  Champlain, claiming that it is his absolute favorite dish so we had to try that instead. And....it was AMAZING! In simple terms, the Plogue Ã  Champlain is a combo of buckwheat pancake, potato,  fle-aux-grues cheddar, fried egg, thick cut Canadian bacon and foie gras covered in a maple syrup. Super rich and flavorful, and the foie gras itself just melts in your mouth. Unforgettably delicious.   For main courses, I ordered the Duck in a Can, and my husband had the Catch of the Day, which was their tuna steak. The Duck in a Can was unique and unlike anything I've tried before (the can was opened right at table side and contents flipped/poured on top of veggie puree). The foie gras and duck meat were even a little bloody looking on some parts, but the waiter guaranteed that everything is cooked (super cooked) in 200+ degree temperature. I don't know, I probably wouldn't be ordering that again. Don't get me wrong, the duck meat itself was tasty, but the veggie puree/sauce was too salty and the foie gras was too bloody looking for me.   As for the tuna steak, the husband said it was very good. Unfortunately, I couldn't try since it was raw, only seared on the sides and raw fish is definitely not for pregos. To be honest, I shouldn't even be eating foie gras, but I could not resist so let's just pretend that's ok.   Anyway, I did not find their desserts interesting, so skipped dessert here. Oh and did I forget to mention that I had lots of their house bread? Their house bread (baguette) was so good, coupled with the soft butter. I was very satisfied since I walked in starving.   PS: Overall, the foie gras was top notch. I was also impressed with their service; the bread was refilled when down to 1 slice. Water glass was never left empty. Super knowledgeable waiter who wasn't afraid of being adamant about certain dishes when asked for his opinion. Definitely worth a try if in the area, enjoy~"}
{"text":"Let me begin this review by saying that this is a very special restaurant and that there's some marvelous cooking happening here. I'll also say that the fact that it has four stars and not closer to five is also telling how it borders on novelty (and given all of the attention it's gotten in the media, that's not a huge surprise). I imagine we weren't the only tourists there...  Several years ago I drove up here from upstate NY and had the duck in a can, which was terrific, and no pretense of overeating, and left feeling warm and comforted. Two years ago I came with a group and we got the pigs head (for two!) This was one of the most decadent offerings I've seen anywhere (with a lobster stuffed into the head of a pig fried in duck fat...) We all took part, and our eastern European friend, who had zero fear or inhibitions about eating *all* of the animal gleefully consumed the brains, eyes, snout, etc... It was the summer and everything was great.  Fast forward to last March when I visited with B and way over-ordered on the advice of the server. Everything seemed overdone--a level of fat (and I know that's what we're there for) that simply overpowered us. We got the eponymous pig's foot, which was mostly a gelatinous case filled with leg fat surrounded by goopy, somehow stringy cheese mashed-potatoes. All of the appetizers were, on the other hand, over-seasoned--too salty (the tripe), or too sweet (the salmon head). Dessert was nice--I got the maple syrup pie, which tastes like the real deal (amber best grade!) She got the burnt bread ice-cream, which was unremarkable aside from its name...  The service was unfortunately C+. It was a busy night, but we waited fifteen minutes to order dessert and another ten just to get the check. They were, at least, very friendly and accommodated us quickly when we pointed out a mistake on the tab.  And so I wish I could give APdC 3.5 stars. I'm not sure if I'll go back after this, but for those of you not tl;dr yet, here's the pro-tip for two:  Order one entree to split Order two appetizers: one \"exotic\" the other a salad Enjoy the excellent bread but don't eat it all! Share a dessert  You'll be absolutely stuffed, but not regretting it all the next day as we were."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food here. Had a brilliant Fois Gras main and a creative entree. Strong flavours mixed really well together. This place was a highly of my trip to Montreal and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our reservation was for a larger group, and as per usual i chose the tasting menu to see the best that they can offer. If you are a carnivore, this restaurant is perfect for you. Everything was delicious and as expected the Steak, and Pork flank melted in the mouth. The exceptional part of the night was a rare gem of a wine bottle that made this a truly memorable dinner. Good job guys"}
{"text":"Duck in a Can, foie gras dishes, poutine, venison tartare.  Most delicious meal we had while in Montreal."}
{"text":"It almost seems unnecessary to review this restaurant because it is has such a high caliber of food, and the dining experience is wonderful. I think it doesn't matter what you order it'll be more than satisfying. I had a \"wow\" experience as I ate the dish named after the restaurant - Au Pied de Cochon. It consisted of pig's food perfectly cooked in a heavy savory sauce with mushrooms, foie gras and mashed potatoes. The first bite was the absolute best. I couldn't believe how good it tasted. This meal is best shared with someone as it is heavy and too much for one patron. In addition to the food, I had a blueberry mojito made with the restaurant's own gin...very refreshing and tasty. They also have a nice wine list if you want it by the glass or bottle. Be ready to pay for what you are getting; it's worth it. The people working there are also extremely accommodating & friendly. Overall, it's a fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in North America. Every time we've been there we've been treated well and fed better. From the fois gras poutine to the duck in a can, and everything else, it's just cool.  And if you're lucky, Chef Picard will be there. It's fun to watch him work."}
{"text":"I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)  We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!  The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead.   1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic.   2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish.   3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned.   4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish!   5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over purÃ©ed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish.   6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors.   It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense."}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon was an amazing experience. It's been almost a week since I dined there on Duluth Street, but I'm still talking about the evening.   I booked reservations a few weeks in advance of my trip, knowing that it was not a place that you can walk into. A few people I met with in Montreal were surprised that I was able to get a seat - until they heard that I had planned ahead.   Our waitress was great and provides great advice and recommendations.   This place was hyped up and was ready for high expectations.   Here's what we ate:  Appetizers: Cromesquis Foie Gras - very rich and the right size to pop in your mouth. A nice way to experience foie gras.   Poutine Foie Gras - decadent. My dining companion had this as his first poutine. All future poutine will now be disappointing.   Smoke Shack Ham - served with lovely little pancakes. This was a delicious meat.   Mains: Zampone - a pigs foot stuffed with charcuterie and served with a maple glaze. Very rich. A delicacy which will induce a happy food coma.   Duck in a Can - the most underwhelming item we tried. It was not that flavorful and was a bit mushy.   Dessert - we were too full. Did you read what we ate?  We had a great bottle of wine and our waitress treated us to shots of a liqueur after lounging in our food coma state.   The ambience was great. The weather was nice and the doors were open to the street.   The restaurant was crowded but not uncomfortable.   The restroom was really hot. It felt like the heat was on in there.   In summary, make a reservation and go to Au Pied de Cochon! It's a wonderful gastronomic experience that blends the allure of the sugar shack with modern Canadian cuisine.   I hope to go back!"}
{"text":"Decadent and rich food that come in huge portion sizes, this is probably the most accurate way to describe this place. Au pied de cochon is pretty much pig feet, so of course I was going to order that.  Coming from a foreigner, I would recommend this place to any out of towner. We also ordered the pickled beef tongue and duck in a can. Everything was rich and delicious. They did forget about my duck fat fries, but I was too full to care, so I cancelled it. Wish I had a second stomach so I could have ordered their special, bone marrow with cavier."}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable time for a vegan in a place like this.  Acceptable wine by the glass list and LOVELY service.  They could spend some time considering how they can apply their considerable culinary skills to feed those of us who ACCOMPANY the omnivorous - we're growing in numbers and the slightest care to feed us properly is SO appreciated...tofu is cheap and lasts for AGES in the fridge people.  Think about it!"}
{"text":"After 700+ Yelp reviews I don't think I can add more to the commentary.  This place IS Montreal dining and if you go to one restaurant in the city I think its this is.  I've always liked Anthony Bourdain's take on this place: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD2HxJoCD54"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals i have ever had.  You need to be a meat lover though as it is primarily pork dishes (and heavy and rich pork dishes at that).  They did have a fish dish on the menu for non-meat eaters, but thats not why you go there.  I was with a large group and so we ordered quite a few of the appetizers and smaller dishes.  Make sure you have one of the Foi Gras dishes.  They were sensational.  One of the entree's was called the melting pot.  It had 4 or 5 different kinds of pork in a bowl.  It had a regular sausage, a blood sausage, some sort of pulled pork and two other things.  The blood sausage in particular was outstanding and was probably the best blood sausage i have ever had.  The restaurant itself is narrow and can get a little loud.  Try and get a table in the front where if the weather permits the full length windows are open to the street.    Servers were friendly and well versed in the menu.  They made good suggestions with the best being the waiter told me that if i ordered another appetizer \"I would Die\".  I am VERY glad i didn't order the additional appetizer."}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner and was extremely impressed . The food was absolutely amazing and I was in love with the hot chicken dish .    As a side note there are TV's in the bathroom!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and a must if you're in Montreal. Come in hungry bc you'll get a rich and hearty meal. We ordered the infamous duck in a can, mushroom tortellini (tonites special), the steamed dumplings & plogue a Champlain \"foie gras breakfast\" - which was the highlight of the night. buckwheat pancake,  thick Canadian bacon, potatoes and cheese topped with foie gras. I wish it was one of the earlier items delivered I would have enjoyed a few more bites. Would def come here with a group to be able to taste more items on the menu.    It's a busy restaurant so do make reservations. We scored 9:30 pm reservations on a Sunday night and place was packed with ppl still coming in with reservations after us. Service was slow and we had a really long wait b/t entrees coming out. We didn't leave until after 11:30. Luckily for us, our toddler was still on California time and was cooperative."}
{"text":"Just when I thought poutine couldn't get any better, I tried the foie gras poutine at Au Pied de Cochon. Everything crave-worthy about poutine, plus a luscious velvety smooth but surprisingly light foie gras gravy that drips over the melting cheese and fries. Definitely the highlight of the meal for me. Mmm...  Between the meat (both standard and offal) and the wine, the rest of the meal was a bit of a blur. The pied de cochon (pig foot) was delicious, but I wasn't crazy about the veal liver. This was probably one of the heaviest meals I've ever had, but it was amazing. I would come back again and again just for the poutine alone."}
{"text":"Holy decadence. The poutine=delicious fries drenched in gravy and foie gras. Goose dinner Wine  My boyfriend and I needed to be rolled out but was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the restaurant, but to its foodtruck.   I got their pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras poutine. The portion seems small, but it actually filled me until dinner. The price is high, but it's pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras after all!   I definitely will have to go to their restaurant someday :)"}
{"text":"J'adore le sucre, j'aime l'Ã©rable et tout le monde aime le gras et la viande. C'est un peu l'attitude qu'il faut avoir en allant Ã  la Cabane Ã  sucre du Pied de cochon.  Nous sommes Ã©tÃ©s lÃ -bas avec un groupe de 32 durant la saison du menu sucre.  Il faut Ãªtre prÃªt mentalement pour aller Ã  la cabane Ã  sucre au Pied de cochon, pour de vrai. Il faut s'attendre Ã  manger beaucoup trop, Ã  voir beaucoup d'excÃ¨s, mais surtout Ã  voir beaucoup de mÃ©langes.  J'ai Ã©tÃ© content de l'expÃ©rience, mais aprÃ¨s dÃ©jÃ  3 ans d'affilÃ©s que j'y vais, la magie y est moins. C'est trÃ¨s bon, c'est trÃ¨s spÃ©cial, mais c'est too much un peu. Le nombre d'ingrÃ©dients dans une tourtiÃ¨re est assez hallucinant.  Par contre, je recommande Ã  tout le monde de vivre Ã§a une fois dans leur vie.  Pour commencer, vous serez accueilli par un plateau de desserts. Une partie des desserts est servie en premier, car ils se rendaient compte que personne ne les mangeait une fois arrivÃ© Ã  la fin.

Vous y trouverez aussi un poulet farci avec du homard et un peu de gras. Vous aurez une omelette de saucisses avec un peu de cervelle de cochon dessus.  Ce sont quelques-uns des mets que vous pouvez y trouver qui vous feront dire \"comment il a trouvÃ© l'idÃ©e de faire cela\".  Finalement, vous aurez un, Ã´ trÃ¨s bon, gateau des anges avec une meringue Ã  l'Ã©rable avec de la crÃ¨me glacÃ©e Ã  l'Ã©rable avec un morceau de tire. C'est un vrai dÃ©lice, je dois l'avouer.

{"text":"Hands down some of the best food ever. Martin takes a very haute-attitude to some classic Quebecois dishes, it's a great fusion. Additionally, the staff is knowledge and great.  If you're in Montreal, you have to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Wednesday, 5pm. Reservation via email. Party of 3. Food: 86% ----  ***If we had done it all over again, I would have gotten 2 apps and 2 main dishes for a party of 3. You really needed space to enjoy the flavors but we were hurting half way through the 3rd appetizer. lol. Kuddos to au pied de cochon.  Foie Gras & Boudin Tart - 90% This is served on a flaky puff pastry. Blood sausage was amazing. The foie gras was a little milder on this dish, and the boudin was definitely the star. Watch out though as there is mustard in this dish, which may put off some diners.   Plogue a Champlain - 90% Though the serving was on the smaller side, don't be fooled. This one is one heavy dish. The list of ingredients (if I can remember all of them) were - foie gras on top of cheese, on top of egg, topped with maple syrup, resting on a bed of thin waffles (i think). Anyway, this is explosion of heavy-handed flavors with tons of fat. !! :)  Foie Gras Dumplings - 80% Two types of dumplings - pork with foie gras, and shrimp with foie gras in squid ink. There's a third ingredient in each dumpling that I'm forgetting. Served in a traditional bamboo steamer. Comes with 2 sauces served on the side. You pour the soy-maple syrup sauce on a white spoon that they give you, then you place the dumpling on top of the sauce, then you drizzle the spoon with maple syrup (loool). This was a good solid dish, however the foie gras really didnt shine in this one either in taste or texture. This was probably the weakest out of everything we tasted.  Duck in a Can - 90% Fat on fat on fat. The foie gras here is a lot less softer than in the other dishes. It has a nice give to it and you would think it's another part of the duck until you slice into it. The duck skin is not crispy since the duck breast has been confited in the can but not seared after like a normal duck confit would be. But regardless, the taste was great, and the sauce on the plate (which I thought was probably some parsnip puree with a lot of butter) went amazingly with every other ingredient. There are 2 pieces of baguettes at the bottom of the dish. Shredded cabbage and carrots. Definitely try this dish, but it would be better on an emptier stomach lol.   Pied de Cochon - 80% This one was the biggest (BIGGEST) surprise. SERIOUSLY? The 'serving plate' was a low rise dutch oven. LOOOOOOL. This one was really good. For those who like pig's foot, they did this one justice. The meat was soft but firm at the same time. The sauce around the meat was creamy with a strong hint of tang to it. There was mashed potatoes (I think) at the bottom too. Mushrooms were everywhere. Also, it's a pig's LEG, not just the hoof. So this one destroyed us.   Service: 100% ---- The specials were NUMEROUS but the hostess was very adept, explained everything, was very polite, courteous and patient. She was amazing. Service is either in English or French and they ask you at the very beginning. The servers are obviously more french than the waiter/waitress who takes your order. The service was very efficient, and the people who bring the food to your table are very amicable. NOTE: This was a 5pm reservation, which meant FIRST service time. The place was not packed and I think they purposely do this to stagger the ordering times. The place filled up as we got to our 2nd hour.   Ambience: 95% ---- Spring season, facing the cobble-stone street with the main glass divider open. Bistro, open, airy.   Value: 95% --- This place is expensive. But I guarantee maximum fullness to the brink of explosion. We had 3 appetizers and 2 main dishes totaling to $200 (no tip yet; we left 20%). But we were already forcing ourselves to finish the rest of the main dishes and still did not finish at all. We had to take the pig's foot back to our hotel with us."}
{"text":"My family took me here for a belated birthday years ago, and I still can remember that meal.   I just remember that we had a lot of foie gras dishes and duck. I believe the best was the Foie Gras Poutine. I can drink a gallon of that gravy.   Usually duck and foie gras are not exactly my cup of tea, but it was amazing here.   I was just watching Anthony Bourdain and he just mentioned foie gras, so it triggered my memories in Montreal. Definitely would come back and eat here again... and again... and again."}
{"text":"Great poutine, good duck, great halibut.    Snotty, slow service. The hostess was rude and nearly nonverbal (and I'm bilingual). The air conditioning was raining water on us, and she was mean about our request for a different table if possible.   Though the food is excellent, there is equally inventive food with better service in Montreal."}
{"text":"The foie gras poutine is worth the visit alone. I love the fact that this place isn't pretentious -- it's egalitarian in the sense that you don't have to be some sort of snobby foodie to enjoy yourself. I was comfortable in jeans and sneakers. (Granted, I had to wear jeans with a loose waistband, because by the time I left, I was practically popping out).   We started with the foie gras poutine and a salad, which seems odd given the rest of the menu. But the salad was topped with rabbit and a deep fried soft egg. Very good.  I had the Duck in a Can, which arrived around twenty minutes after our appetizer plates were taken away. Included a giant chunk of duck breast, foie gras, and fat. Love the fat. Only weakness was the puree and bread the canned duck was emptied out onto -- I was hoping for more of a mashed potato, it tasted more like sunchoke or parsnip with cabbage.   My husband had the beef rib, which looked like something Fred Flintstone ordered in the opening credits of the Flintstones (y'know, at the drive in movie theatre, where the server places it on the car tray and the car tips over?). You'd think a hunk of rib that gigantic would be tough and sinewy, but quite the opposite -- it was so tender and nom-tastic.   I wish I'd left room for dessert, but after all that foie gras and fat, I felt like I was going to keel over and die. (From happiness as well as fullness.)  The only crappy thing was that we had a 9pm reservation and we weren't seated until 9:40. The hostess was really nice about it, though - she offered us something to drink and was very apologetic. Once we were seated, it wasn't that long until we received our appetizers. Despite this bump in the road, the experience was still amazing from start to finish."}
{"text":"One of the great meals you can get in Montreal.  It is a must visit and truely one of the unique experiences of Montreal.  One thing I loved about it is, its not so uppity about itself, in fact it's almost casual.  It truly is the temple of foie gras, duck and pork that all the Bourdain's have made it out to be.  Which is in fact a wonderful thing.  When I went recently I shared the pigs head with someone else, just cause, where and when else are you going to get to order a pigs head?  It was awesome but next time I would prob stick to the smaller plates to get more of a sampling.  The chicharron and the fries are fried in duck fat.  You must get these.  They are magnificent.  By the way the portions here are huge so keep that in mind when ordering."}
{"text":"This was my second time to Au Pied de Cochon. The first time was nearly two years ago. Back then my interest was piqued after seeing Anthony Bourdain slink down onto the bar with overwhelmed gluttony at the whims of chef Martin Picard - surely the restaurant wasn't as ridiculous as it seemed in that episode?!   Tonight, I returned and it was better than I remembered the first time.  Two years ago, we got the bison tongue with tarragon, foie gras poutine and duck in a can. The bison tongue was thinly shaved, lightly seasoned and the perfect starter. It floated above the heavy foie gras poutine and dark syrupy balsamic reduction that drenched the tender duck. It was a mesmerizing meal (I do recommend trying all these dishes if you go!) but one that wasn't appreciated until a couple days later -- after some \"rest and digest\" and gripping gallbladder pain. Just kidding.  This time, Au Pied de Cochon was even better because I felt like I understood the place a little more. It's a farce on excess, a deliberate play on everything overwhelming -- a chance for Martin Picard, the crazy French chef who created the place, to laugh to himself and poke fun at all the people he's duped into eating something as ridiculous as foie gras on POUTINE!!! Seriously people, there's a joke in here somewhere, and as the meal progresses and your eyes glaze over, Picard has to be back there behind the cotton candy machine, cackling away. We started with the monte cristo -- ridiculous mounds of flavorful smoked ham and cabbage soaked in maple butter and maple mustard, cradled between two egg battered brioche slices drizzled in maple syrup. Sick, right? But just so good. This was followed by the foie gras poutine -- melt-in-your-mouth foie gras with a slightly crisp salty crust doused in cream, gravy, cheese curds and poured over fries cooked in duck fat. My arteries were hardening. My husband thought he wouldn't be able to make it. The final course -- the pied de cochon, literally the \"foot of the pig\" - was totally amazing and we had to take the rest of it in a bag with us because we couldn't eat more than a few bites of the tender pork and slightly sour sauce that complemented the salty skin of the pork with surprising harmony.   All in all, one of the best meals I've ever had and the value was astounding....around $22 each dish, so less than $70 for food total. Wine and beer were reasonably priced. I made reservations about 6 weeks in advance. If you are a foodie with a good sense of humor, you must make the trip to Montreal to eat at Au Pied de Cochon."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  The vibe, decor and service are all great.  A seat at the provides front seat view of the amazing kitchen and chefs at work.    Have had their fried fois gras, sausage pot, duck in a can, poutine and their brulee.    Super heavy and delectably delicious. Can't eat a lot there without feeling like I need to walk for 5 hours but I do anyways.   Sausage pot is a repeat order!  Their wine list and recommendations were good."}
{"text":"I live in TO.   I drove 6 hours to Montreal last July just to eat in this restaruants and it was worth every minute of my time."}
{"text":"It' s not awful by any means but I think it's overhyped.  I came here on a number of occasions over several years.    I was disappointed the last couple of times.  Both at the restaurant and the sugar shack.  My first meal at the sugar shack was lighter and more refined.  And since then it's been good but more focused on quantity.  Huge amounts of comfort food.  We went 3 times and then stopped going a few years ago.  This is because it's hard to schedule.  Certainly I would go back again.  As for the restaurant, my dish the last time didn't have enough foie gras.  It was barely detectable.  Whereas I had hoped to be delighted, I remember being disappointed with my food in general.  They are very busy; it's very crowded and noisy.  I did have a VERY memorable experience here however.  When my friends were visiting from out of town, we came here and ordered a PIG HEAD.  It's really the whole kit and caboodle.  The ears were crispy...it was actually quite good but it was hard to get past the visual.  And, our friends wouldn't have any of it.  But, it's good to be in touch with your food.  I don't eat that much meat and I don't like to waste.  So I like their philosophy to not waste.  I think that if you want to be immersed in 'local' culture (food with a regional flair) or if you are a local with out of town visitors then this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Duck in a can. What else needs to be said? The hype is real here people.   Let's get down into the weeds though:   Service - friendly and helpful staff that can easily accommodate English only groups like mine. The knowledge of the dishes and the wine pairings helped us navigate our way to a beautiful combination.   Ambiance - it was likely just where we were sat but this is where I felt the experience could have been better. The weather was gorgeous on the evening we went, so if we had sat closer to the open storefront there would have been less crowding and a little more tolerable music volume (of which was a tad too high for conversation).  Food - the foie gras poutine and the Duck in a can stand out big time on this menu. We ordered a few more delicious things here and there really were no duds, but my god the foie gras poutine.... so dang delicious. Everything is unapologetically fatty and simply delectable."}
{"text":"How many ways can you have fois gras?  Whatever list is in your head, the staff at PDC have thought of at least 10 more. You'll probably need to make a reservation, but it's worth it.   Now, I have to say that the whole process ordering was really jarring and slightly off-putting because I was starving and there were so many specials that needed to be explained to me.... but they weren't really soaking in as it's not a very simple explanation for anything, so you kind of feel the weight on your shoulders of having to learn a fable to pass it down to another generation (any diner next to you who may have missed something) and I think because of that, 80% of it went over my head.   SO. We ordered off the menu.   First of all, get the poutine. Just order some for the table while you make up your minds on what to order.   The duck in a can seemed to be a crowd favorite and was very *cough* instagrammable... but I went for the pork in the end and wasn't disappointed. You really couldn't go wrong here as long as you like pork, fois gras and don't worry about your fat intake. It's certainly an experience in Canadian cuisine and you can tell they're quite famous among the locals."}
{"text":"RÃ©sidente de MontrÃ©al, c'Ã©tait un peu comme un sacrilÃ¨ge de n'avoir jamais pris place Ã  une des tables d'Au Pied De Cochon. AprÃ¨s tout, ce resto est considÃ©rÃ© comme Ã©tant un ''Must'' pour les touristes, alors pourquoi ne pas profitÃ© du fait que je puisse m'y rendre Ã  pied de chez moi en 10 minutes? J'allais pouvoir comprendre ce que les gens du monde entier considÃ¨rent comme Ã©tant la gastronomie MontrÃ©alaise!  Nous avons pu facilement prendre une rÃ©servation pour notre groupe de 4 la journÃ©e mÃªme de notre souper. Ã l'arrivÃ©e, l'endroit se dÃ©marque par son absence de prÃ©sentation extÃ©rieure; qu'un grand mur de bois agencÃ© Ã  de grandes fenÃªtres, dÃ©voilant Ã  l'intÃ©rieur une Ã©tonnamment petite salle Ã  manger. On comprendra plus tard qu'il s'agit du tÃ©moignage de l'importance du service apportÃ© aux clients durant leur souper, privilÃ©giant une expÃ©rience proche de la perfection Ã  un petit nombre de gens plutÃ´t qu'une plus grande masse servie dans un chaos organisÃ©.  Le service frÃ´la effectivement la perfection. Notre serveur nous a tous hautement impressionnÃ© avec sa mÃ©moire phÃ©nomÃ©nale, autant au moment de la commande que lors de la sÃ©paration finale des factures. Le seul point nÃ©gatif dont je peux me rappeler est notre ''busboy'' qui avait vraisemblablement oubliÃ© de se mettre du dÃ©odorant ce soir lÃ , mais je ne mettrai pas le blÃ¢me sur le restaurant, on a tous nos mauvaises journÃ©es!  Dans la vie, je ne suis pas une fan de viande. J'Ã©vite mÃªme d'en manger, me contentant bien aisÃ©ment d'une diÃ¨te basÃ©e sur la verdure et un peu de poissons. J'ai fait un exception ce soir-lÃ , la foodie en moi ne pouvant pas se permettre de priver mes papilles des plats honorant la carte d'un des restaurants les plus rÃ©putÃ©s de MontrÃ©al. Et tout ce que j'ai goÃ»tÃ© m'a carrÃ©ment jetÃ© Ã  terre.  CommenÃ§ant par l'assiette de cochonnailles, s'en suivit ensuite une salade de crabe, des langues de bisons, un temaki Ã  la poutine et une tartelette aux poireaux, ricotta maison, chanterelles et smoked meat, mon ''high light'' absolu de la soirÃ©e. Je n'aurais pu manger que cette tartelette et j'aurai pu partir heureuse. Les gars du groupe ont continuÃ© avec le magret de canard et le burger de foie gras, tous deux dÃ©cadents, et nous avons terminÃ© avec la Bombe Alaska, du sorbet Ã  la framboise recouvert d'un gÃ¢teau blanc, ce dernier surmontÃ© d'une meringue flambÃ©e au cognac. Je ne crois pas avoir besoin d'en dire plus, sinon j'ai peur de vous voir briser votre clavier. J'ai bien vu votre bouche saliver  Ã  la lecture du menu, et toute cette bave risque de s'infiltrer entre les touches de votre fragile matÃ©riel technologique. Je sais que maintenant vous avez faim.   Niveau boisson, j'ai Ã©tÃ© agrÃ©ablement surprise par le goÃ»t lÃ©ger de la biÃ¨re vedette du restaurant. Exactement ce qu'il faut pour accompagner un repas lourd et gras! Le mojito Ã  la framboise Ã©tait rafraÃ®chissant sans Ãªtre trop sucrÃ©, mais je ne vous conseille pas d'avoir la brillante idÃ©e d'accompagner votre dessert sucrÃ© d'un Lait FrappÃ© XXX comme nous l'avons fait. Ce dessert, si innocent Ã  vue d'oeil, est en fait un dÃ©cadent verre alcoolisÃ© de boisson crÃ©meuse Ã  l'Ã©rable et de lait trÃ¨s sucrÃ©. MÃªme Ã  4 nous avons eu de la difficultÃ© Ã  le terminer!   Au final, la facture fut plus douce que prÃ©vu dans mon cas. Ayant sÃ©parÃ© tout mes plats (1 apÃ©ritif, 2 entrÃ©es, 1 dessert) et comptant mes 2 consommations, mon total s'Ã©leva Ã  65$ avec pourboire, ce que je trouve trÃ¨s abordable pour un repas gastronomique des plus mÃ©morables!   Pour une agrÃ©able sortie originale entre amis c'est parfait, et c'est encore plus intÃ©ressant si vous Ãªtes de MontrÃ©al mais n'avez jamais visitÃ© l'endroit. Par contre je vous prÃ©viens; si vous voulez y aller en duo, vous aurez de la difficultÃ© Ã  choisir quoi manger, car le but du restaurant est dÃ©finitivement de prendre un peu de tout et de partager!"}
{"text":"Je vous Ã©cris aujourd'hui en direct de mon hangover de la Cabane Ã  Sucre du PDC. Pas que j'aie abusÃ© de consommations alcoolisÃ©es (quoi que j'ai quand mÃªme profitÃ© de quelques breuvages malsains), mais c'est plutÃ´t Ã  un hangover stomachique auquel je dois faire face. C'est sans aucun regret que je vous rewind le tout:  Respirer fait mal. Le simple fait d'exister me rappelle que mon estomac est au delÃ  de son point de saturation. La cabane est rÃ©putÃ©e pour ses \"take-out\" de fin de repas (tout ce que tu ne manges pas, tu le ramÃ¨nes chez toi), mais Ã©tonnamment notre groupe de 10 n'a pas quittÃ© avec tant de restants. On Ã©tait clairement plus gourmand que notre sentiment de satiÃ©tÃ©.  Le plateau des desserts fait finalement sont entrÃ©e. Pas un, ni deux, mais bien 5 Âuvres d'arts sucrÃ©es se prÃ©lassent devant nous: Un magnifique gÃ¢teau chocolat bleuet encore chaud, une tarte aux fraises, un trottoir pomme rhubarbe, une bombe Alaska; le reste est flou. Tout ce dont je me rappelle, c'est d'avoir commandÃ© un cafÃ© alcoolisÃ© au cidre de glace qui finalement a perdu tout son intÃ©rÃªt face aux desserts qui Ã©taient beaucoup trop bon pour ne pas Ãªtre mangÃ©s. Je n'avais dÃ©finitivement plus faim, mais ma cuillÃ¨re faisait des allÃ©s-retours vers ma bouche sans rien Ã©couter d'autre que mes papilles gustatives qui criaient \"Oh oui, encore!\", au grand regret du reste de mon corps qui savait plus oÃ¹ stocker ces bouchÃ©es de bonheur.  Le service est rapide (dirais-je mÃªme un peu trop?), ne nous laissant pas une minute de rÃ©pit pour digÃ©rer entre les services. Se prÃ©sentent Ã  nous les plats principaux: Une tajine de porc surmontÃ©e de riz de veau cuite au BBQ, du maquereau fondant servit sur un lit d'aubergine et de tresses de merguez, ainsi qu'un pain de viande avec du bacon, du brie, du bacon, et du bacon. Les assiettes se dÃ©placent et se remplissent de protÃ©ines, et il va sans dire que tout Ã©tait dÃ©licieux. Mon coup de cÂur personnel va au porc, viande que je trouve habituellement ennuyante, mais dont j'ai rempli mon petit pot de \"take-out\" lorsque plus personne n'Ã©taient capable de lever sa fourchette. On se dit tous qu'on doit se garder de la place pour le dessert, mais comment rester de glace devant un si bon repas? On a beau en rapporter Ã  la maison, une fois passÃ© au four micro-onde, c'est jamais pareil que fraÃ®chement sorti du four.   C'est aprÃ¨s Ã  peine 10 minutes d'attente  que les premiÃ¨res assiettes font leurs entrÃ©es. La table est fÃ©brile, et on ne peut pas quitter des yeux la serveuse qui nous prÃ©sente le premier plat: Une soupe aux tomates servit depuis une Ã©norme canne de soupe \"Campbell\" et du pain briochÃ© fourrÃ© Ã  la saucisse dÃ©goulinante de fromage, pains ayant Ã©tÃ© cuit Ã  mÃªme les cannes dans lesquels ils nous sont prÃ©sentÃ©s! On commence Ã  peine Ã  engloutir notre dÃ©cadente soupe que d'autres plats se rajoutent Ã  la table: Des huÃ®tres gratinÃ©es au fois gras et bÃ©chamel (highlight de la soirÃ©e pour bon nombre de gourmands), rouleaux de printemps au tataki de bÂuf et fois gras, cannellonis Ã  l'encre de sÃ¨che et ricotta maison, chou fleur roti surmontÃ© de cervelle frite et un joli plat de pÃ¢tes avec tofu maison pour finaliser le tout. On prend presque tous la bonne dÃ©cision d'accompagner notre repas d'un liquide dorÃ© qu'on appelle amoureusement un White Velvet (biÃ¨re blonde du PDC + cidre), on cheers et on dÃ©bute. Pire que des aspirateurs, on en est presque Ã  licher les bols pour Ãªtre certains qu'il ne reste plus rien, sauf un solitaire cannelloni qui terminera sa vie en lunch le lendemain midi.   On a Ã©tÃ© prÃ©venu, et je vous prÃ©viens Ã  mon tour: Il faut arriver le ventre vide et prÃªt Ã  manger la lune. On a peine Ã  le croire sans l'avoir vÃ©cu, car avant de s'asseoir on a toujours un peu trop confiance en notre appÃ©tit de loup. Ain't no mountain high enough qu'ils disent, sauf the one full of food and fat and joy at La Cabane Ã  Sucre du PDC."}
{"text":"IMA in Montreal.  I loved Au Pied de Cochon!  First, the room is casual, nicely lit, and has a great feel to it.  It is the kind of place where you know you are going to have a fun night.  But of course, you are there for the food and drink.  Unfortunately, they were out of the duck in a can, but it ended up being a blessing because we got to try the Guinea Hen for two, which was one of the best meals I've ever had.  I also enjoyed the fois gras poutine and some of the appetizers.   I appreciate that the restaurant also has some very reasonably priced wines on their expansive yet focused wine list.   All in all, a home run."}
{"text":"Reservations were recommendation so I emailed the restaurant. .  .   \"Good morning, I would like to make dinner reservations for one for Oct 5 if possible.  I will be traveling to Montreal by myself and would love to dine at a place famed for foie gras.  Please let me know what times are available, I can be very flexible but I prefer 8 pm.\"  Response. . .  \"Hello, Thank you for your reservation request. For how many people would you like to reserve on October 5th ?\"  Ummmm please do not let this be an indication of how my solo trip is going to be!!!  Is it so strange for a lady to be traveling by herself just because??!?!  I responded, reiterating that I will be traveling by myself and would only need a reservation for one, just me, nobody but me and my independent woman self.  I was granted my reservation and marched in a few weeks later.  The reception from the hostess, waiter and everybody at the restaurant was the very definition of welcoming and helpful.  I was seated at the bar next to a couple other single diners with a full view of the kitchen.  The kitchen commotion was a refreshing change from staring at my phone during a meal (the thing was useless anyway since I was out of the country).  After a nice discussion with the waiter over my options, we decided that I would enjoy the squid ink pasta with sea urchin (you had me at sea urchin) and the foie gras tout nu.  Both dishes were very rich with generous portions and were absolutely heaven.  I would have licked the plates to pay my compliments to the chef if I was a little bit less inhibited!!  The two appetizers were a bit much for my solo self as I attacked a plate of poutine earlier for lunch.  I was uncomfortably full but gustatorily satisfied.    Note to self - Save precious stomach space next time!!  You are no long a young spring chicken who can finish a whole large pizza in one setting!!  Those days are over!!  For my next visit I am eyeing the foie gras cromesquis and the \"duck in a can\" as recommended by so many reviewers. . . Unless my waiter persuades me to another dish ;-)"}
{"text":"Stop reading this review and get in your car and go now.   If you are waiting for your taxi (because Montreal killed Uber) and still reading...order the foie gras poutine, then the happy pork chop or the duck in a can, and some duck fat fries. Finally, for the love of god, order the Maple Poudding ChÃ´meur.  Note - Its not a terrible Idea to buy some Lipitor and wear elastic pants as a precaution. Safely first."}
{"text":"This is an iconic spot for excellent reasons. Packed even at 830 so make a reservation which we did. Good service of occasional spots of busy cause them to slow down. Do be aware that tables near the oven can seem warm. The food was great (heavy so resist over ordering) We had the horse tartare cones amazing presentation and flavour. A fois dish with buckwheat pancake maple syrup veal stock sauce which was beyond yummy. And a so huge we never finished it serving of taglitalle and meatballs. Along with a salad with enough pork to qualify as a protein and not a vegetable.  Great wine list too!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and fantastically hard to get a reservation for.  That being said, I'd suggest that you go early (right when they open) and hope that they have some availability!  Special of the day pate: omgah. large block of pate for 7 bucks? couldn't get enough of it. Foie Gras poutine: best poutine i had throughout my trip to montreal. delicious gravy, chunks of foie gras, fresh cut fries...just can't beat it. a little on the pricier side, though ($23?), but definitely worth it Bison Tongue: This was also pretty good, nice and tender. Boudin blood sausage: I'm not normally a fan of blood sausages so this was only classified as \"alright\" to me. However, my friends loved the taste and the texture Double down: cheese/ham sandwiched in between two lightly breaded pieces of porkchop. quality and hearty.  Everything was pretty much right on the money and highly affordable.   General Tips: 1) Get there early iff you don't have a reservation, because this place fills up quickly 2) Order family style and enjoy"}
{"text":"It really pains me to give Au Pied de Cochon 2 stars, but honestly it didn't live up to the expectations I had for it. It was one of my top 3 musts for my visit to Montreal. Before the appetizers came I was telling my brother how I thought this could possibly be my favorite restaurant ever. I can be wrong from time to time.  The food was hit and miss. Everything sounds amazing when you read it off the menu, but the execution of some of the dishes left much to be desired. It's probably mentioned a lot but it really can't be emphasized enough: almost all the food is really heavy, fatty, and salty. Items I remember trying and would get again: Foie Gras Poutine (obligatory and good), Duck Carpaccio (best dish of the night), Foie Gras Cromesquis (wasn't amazing but it's interesting and I don't know anywhere else that I could get something like this), and another Foie Gras dish I didn't learn the name of. Dishes I probably didn't enjoy that much: Duck in a can (it was not bad, but I wouldn't get it again since it's so salty and at $44, hefty pricing too), Cod Fritters (meh), Lobster Risotto (ugh the risotto was undercooked and too dry for my taste and everyone else's taste at our table so it was a big disappointment), and the PDC Melting Pot (oh god, the worst thing hands down...all the meats were overcooked to the 7th depth of hell and it was all hard and dry...also no pork belly was in it as promised), and lastly, the Creme Brulee was a major dropping of the ball too (the creme was more like wet curds of tofu in texture and it was sour...what the hell). Creme Brulee is my brother's favorite dessert hands down and you guys made him depressed all night over how bad it was.   The servers are really awesome. The main dude was on point as a server. He memorizes orders, is charismatic and helpful, great personality and slightly funny. My brother and I ordered a shit ton and he challenged us to finish it all. We finished everything except we had to take the leftover Melting Pot home. He called us out when we asked for the to-go box for not finishing but it wasn't because we were full. It was just really inedible. I didn't have the heart to tell him that we won the challenge essentially... on top of adding that shitty ass Creme Brulee for dessert afterwards.   Glad I tried it out albeit pretty disappointing. The menu is still interesting enough, but I'd probably not come back with all the other great Montreal restaurants around. Le Club Chasse et Peche would be my next target probably (I hear it's the same owner)."}
{"text":"We had been anticipating our visit to Au pied de cochon for weeks.    Our reservation was for 8pm, but we weren't seated until 8:30pm since the folks sitting at our table lingered over their coffee and dessert...can't say that I blame them.  This place rocks!  Portion sizes are MASSIVE...if you come here, bring your appetite.  We were comped our cod fish fritters and deep fried zucchini flower appetizers.  Both were delicious, but I personally thought the fritters were a little too salty.  They did however some chilies in there so points for that.  I had the Crab tourties (one of their daily specials), while my table mates had the Lamb shank and Steak et frites.  Again, the portion sizes were HUGE and I couldn't finish my tourtiere, which was delcious.  The pastry was flaky as hell, the bottom of the pie was lined with a tasty and thick layer of buttery scalloped potatoes, the creme fraiche was perfectly seasoned with dill and lemon...OMFG!    We skipped dessert.  I can't even believe they even offer dessert given the portion sizes!    Loved it and can't wait to go back.  Next time, I'm having the lamb shank...it was unlike any lamb shank I've ever tried before...and I will avoid eating for the 2 days preceeding my visit so that I can finish my meal this time!  Of note: RESERVATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED.  We saw more than a few parties turned away because they walked in off the street.  We made our reservations a month in advance."}
{"text":"O-M-G. The food here was right up my alley!!! I LOVE rich, intensely flavoured and umami-tasting food, and everything here fit the bill!  I tried the foie gras boudin tart, the foie gras cromequis, and the PDC Farci au Fg, which was HUGE and lasted more than another meal at home!   Servers were so friendly and helpful with wine suggestions. I wanted to eat more, but simply could not as I was stuffed, and brought a lot of food home.   If they had half portions of the main dishes that would be perfect so you can try more dishes.   Can't wait to be back! A no-fail choice to celebrate any occasion for sure!!!"}
{"text":"With all the hype  around this restaurant it was inevitable to find some shortcomings but all in all it was a wonderful experience. The first one was the hostess. She was so frazzled with the tempo of the busy restaurant that she repeatedly snapped at waiting patrons and me as well.  While standing in line we remarked to each other that the restaurant should hire someone to help her. Or just find someone more equipped with handling the stress of working in a restaurant.  It's a bad thing to have her be the gatekeeper of the restaurant. Very bad impressions from the start.  Once we were seated though the experienced wait staff quickly made me forget about the overwhelmed anxiety stricken hostess. Being a party of two I was unable to order what I really wanted in  the pigs head and pied de cochon.  They are humongous showstoppers that made my jaw drop when passing my table.  I had to settle for the tartare temake, foie gras poutine, sturgeon quenelle, foie gras nigiri, and eel special.  I ordered the eel special cause upon entering the restaurant there are huge fish tanks filled with live eels waiting to be devoured.  This was the only mistake I made for this dish was horrible.  The eel was dressed with a weird pesto that gave the fresh eel an unappetizing fishiness that made me gag. On another note the sturgeon quenelle was mind blowing with its soft mousseline texture and rich lardon cream sauce with a hint of maple sweetness to cut the richness. This was by far the best dish of the night.  The foie gras poutine was good but I was surprised that I liked the cheese curds more than the actual foie gras in the dish. The fg nigiri was a pleasant surprise with its huge quantity and exquisite flavor from the maple soy sauce and peanut sauce flavoring.  The only downside was that there was quite evident blood vein that ran the length of the fg piece that had me flavvergasted. How in the he'll are you a temple of foie gras and you don't remove the vein even upon seeing it in plain sight. As a chef this was a travesty for such a foie gras centered establishment. All in all this was a good meal but I would only be back with a large group so I can watch their faces as the pig head and pied de cochon were dropped at the table."}
{"text":"Last meal in Montreal and it did not disappoint. Had dinner here with a couple of friends and we had the back table and were able to have some drinks and dine on some really good food. The duck in a can was so flavorful. It's a must get here and damn the flavor profiles coming from it were off the charts. We had some other dishes as well, but the duck in a can just stuck out in my memory so much. The wait wasn't too long and it definitely is one of the more trendier places to dine in Montreal. The forward thinking cooking style here is appreciated by all from the looks of the reviews, and I was impressed with the service and quality of the dishes. If you are in Montreal and have limited dining time, make this a stop on your list or you will have FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) when you leave."}
{"text":"About a quarter-century ago Flavor Flav popularized the admonition, \"Don't believe the hype.\"    It is an edict to which I almost always subscribe.  But on a night in August, Au Pied de Cochon pounded us into submission with a pork-tastic onslaught so forceful and convincing that there was no doubt: We were compelled to believe the hype, at least on this occasion.  The excellence starts right away, because PDC's bread and butter is about the best I've had in a long time:  crusty, chewy, delicous.  This could be a meal in its own right.  Why isn't all bread like this?  We started with the pickled tongue, which is a steal at $4.00.  Pig's tongues are surprisingly large, but this was also tender and flavorful (lightly seared, I think), with just enough vinegar edge to amp it up a bit more without getting cloying.  Flav's dictum came into play only once.  We also ordered one of PDC's most-hyped items, the fois gras poutine.  It was a little warmed-over and limpid, if still very tasty.  Hat-tip to our server, though, for recommending a half portion, which was not even indicated on the menu and which was plenty reasonable in size  I got the \"Melting Pot\" as an entree, which basically amounts to a PDC sampler (there is too much great stuff on the menu to choose from!):  basically a thick stew of pork chop, pork belly, blood sausage, and another housemade saugage, and a rich gravy that resulted in the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  Only complaint about this was that the pork chop was just a little on the tough side, but otherwise this dish was mouthwateringly rich, simple, and great.    Wife got the head cheese plate, which, if recall correctly, was served on thin layers of perfectly cooked gratined potatoes and was also terrific.  I had slightly worried that the atmosphere at Pied de Cochon might be a bit loutish and douche-ified, given its relative slickness, high profile, hype from certain TV personalities, et cetera.  But in the 7-9PM time slot we were there, it was merely pleasantly lively, with a good mix of folks both age-wise and culturally, and the space was a both cozier and more appealing than I thought it might have been.   At only about $120 with tax and tip (and a couple of beers each), very reasonably priced for an experience of the sort you won't find at many other places in North America."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I have ever been to. Beats anything in LA or New York with a sucker punch to the bullocks. Not too pricey. I would suggest going skiing at Jay Peak, and driving the extra hour or so to come have dinner here, then turn around across the border and be fueled up to ski all weekend from the best food of your life. Life does not get any better than this."}
{"text":"This is a tough call.  I know that lots of people really like this place.  While I did, I can't say that I get all the hype.  But if you want to experience something different, then give this a try - that is why I did.  The foie gras crommets (little balls) were ok.  I ate one, but only sucked the insides out of the second.  I ordered the pied do cochon - it was enough for three people.  Loved the foie gras served on top.  The meat was tender, the sauce was very good too.  Quite pricey.    Here is the deal - if you have a spouse or girlfriend who are trying to eat health - don't waste your money here.  There is zero here for them.  Come with a bunch of hungry people and prepare to indulge and be unhealthy."}
{"text":"The service was good, but that's not why we came here.   The food was too salty. I got the PDC melting pot- and while the blood sausage and pork belly were good- the dish needed something to cut the fat and salt. The fact that it was served under a salty gravy and over cheesy salty mashed potatoes didn't help. Everything tasted good separately- but together it was too much.  Thankfully my husband's pork chop came with an apple salad/ slaw to help get some of mine down.   Overall- it was whatever."}
{"text":"DUCK IN  A CAN.  I talk about this dish all the time. How could you ever forget it? Waiter comes to your table. Gently opens the can lid... pops it open and dumps it on your plate.  P O U T I N E  If you are going to have foie gras once in your life.. have it here. Great wine list. Ranging from all prices. Thought the heavy curtained doorway and opened cooking area full of young male cooks were a good way of making you feel like you were in a real kitchen. Bathroom had deep sinks with heavy sprayers from up top.   One minus star for the CrÃ¨me brulÃ©e.. which could have been the beautiful ending.. but was served burnt and cold... Stupid us even called over the waiter and innocently asked if it is was supposed to be served cold. It was pretty gross enough to remember to deduct a point.."}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting this restaurant.  We loved it the last time we were in Montreal so we had to go again.  The duck in a can was spectacular. What was less than stellar was the service as our server was not very friendly.  Also, the bathrooms were disgusting.  Our reservation was for 9:30pm so maybe that had something to do with it but for a restaurant of this caliber you would think they would have someone maintaining it.  The maple ice cream was out of this world good, and so was the maple creme brÃ»lÃ©e.  Unfortunately the negatives took away from our experience."}
{"text":"This place is just magnificent!  We went here for my bachelor party, and it did not disappoint!    Me and my boys attacked this 8-Layer Seafood cornucopia!  It had every imaginable thing from the ocean on it, with the exception of a mermaid!    They seated us in a nice long table, although the wait did take about 30-45mins. Which as it turned out wasn't so bad, as we went to the local store, bought a couple of bottles of wine, and enjoyed it while waiting to be seated!  Once the food came out  we sorta stared at it, not really knowing how to begin tackling such a  challenge!  Guys were dropping like flies after about 1.5hours of non-stop carnage!    Try the foie gras, its unbelievable!  They also had a \"Duck in a Can\"...hard to believe, but it was actually pretty good!    All in all, a great and very memorable experience!  Very authentic, fresh food, with great service and staff!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Au Pied de Cochon for Brunch before heading back to the states. Tough getting a reservation on a weekend for dinner, but luckily the sunday brunch is first come first served. The brunch is served almost dim sun style where they stroll a cart of brunch dishes to your table and you can pick what you want. They then proceed to mark your menu with the items taken. Just like chinese dim sum.  There are over 30 items available that range from savory to sweet, all unique or a play on some traditional fares. Very delicious and enjoyable. I highly recommend it to everyone.  I would put it for 5 stars, but have to take off one star for some organizational issues. They do the push carts, but also allow people to order directly off the menu, and thats fine. Problem is, when we ordered off the menu, some items never got to our table. they somehow got intercepted and put on the regular push cart i suppose? Half the time you dont know if a push card is for people who ordered things or if they will stop by your table. Because of this we were able to try all the item we wanted except for one, where the waiter tried to order it for us 3 times, and still it never showed.   Other than that, of which i hope is a only rare occurrence, I highly recommend brunch here, and will hit up the dinner on my next visit."}
{"text":"Most absurdly decadent meal I've ever eaten, and totally delicious. The beet salad (I know it's a really silly thing to focus on, considering) is beautiful and unique and looks like cake.   I was actually surprised to find that it's totally reasonably priced. The portions are huge and everything is so rich, you can easily share an appetizer and an entree between two people and still slip into contented food comas.  There is so much fat and grease and foie gras juice flying around this place that the floors are slippery and a little treacherous. It's totally glorious."}
{"text":"Amazing French fare with a modern twist. Duck in a Can and the burger were both great. Was recommended by many people and lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"so ridiculously decadent but so worth it! more foie gras than you could ever want and it's perfectly prepared. i had it on top of poutine, with the duck in the can and my companion had it stuffed in a pigs foot. was there a foie gras option for dessert? if i saw it, i might've tried it and it would've been good.  also, perfect service. available but not overbearing. highly recommend for any trip to montreal."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! We were 3 guys. I went with 2 other guys and they are both real foodies. We all said that it might have been top 3 meal of all time. No one had anything slightly bad to say. We ordered like champions. We shared 4 appetizers, 2 mains, and 2 desserts. The Duck Carpaccio was IMPECCABLE! Duck in a can was an experience and it was well worth it. It is really a treat to dine at a restaurant like PDC."}
{"text":"I will say this: Au Pied De Cochon is the best restaurant I have ever been to. Saying anything else other than what's already been said and illustrated in pictures, would just be redundant and not do this place justice. We come here every time we visit beautiful Montreal.  Get yourselves the duck in a can with the PDC mashed potatoes and vegetables side for a complete and delectably rich meal. Don't forget to wash it down with a Griffon brown ale!  P.S. The above meal I suggested can, and SHOULD, be shared between a couple."}
{"text":"Skimpy on the poutine.  Duck in a can....yuck.  Hip n happening place with surprisingly unappetizing food."}
{"text":"foie gras again and again. i made a decision to come back on subsequent visits rather than have to be wheel chaired out or taken to an emergency room after my heart stops from too much foie at once.  didn't have a reservation so arrived a little after 5 pm and asked if they had any availability. seated us right away and we were done in less than 2 hours so they'd have time for their reserved bar seats in time. totally reasonable.   they hand write their reservations here. crazy!  anyway, ordered the apple, blue cheese and endive salad. great combination and perfect to pair with the heavier foie gras dishes. it was great! (btw whats up with their large utensils).  the duck carpaccio was absolutely amazing.  cheese, mushrooms, chives, raw egg, the works. i would love to have this daily. ugh!! angry it isn't this good in nyc!!!  the foie gras poutin. why not combine two things that are delicious right? ABSOLUTELY!!! would recommend ordering duck fat fries to supplement the remaining gravy and curds after you attack this dish. not salty, but truly flavorful. loved it. this place is truly crushing it!  the desserts in montreal are not my cup of tea (neither is the coffee). but we went deep and got the special sunday for two!! seems like it was made for 5 people though.... maple vanilla ice cream, carmel popcorn, maple breading, maple cotton candy, gold leaf dessert. the chocolate was unnecessary, but the carmel popcorn and maple breaded pieces were good. i probably had two bites. it was not good enough to want to encounter more than a couple bites.  i will however be back for more carpaccio and different foie gras dishes on each subsequent visit. yum!!! definitely the best and not somewhere to pass up!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the easiest 5 I have ever given a restaurant. In fact this place might be the best restaurant I have ever been to. I heard a ton about this restaurant and decided to do some research and plan out my meal ahead of time. I highly recommend this strategy since the menu is overwhelming and you will most likely order way too much food.   To start we (my boyfriend and I) ordered the Foie Gras Cromesquis. They were pretty good. The liquefied foie gras inside exploded in our mouths as promised. Next we ordered the Duck Carpaccio which came topped with oil, spices, and a raw egg yolk meant to be mixed in to create a homemade mayo. The duck was paper thin and  good. The next item blew us away. The Bison Tongue in Tarragon Cream Sauce. This item was simply divine. Flavorful, tender, creamy, a hint of spice. The textures and flavors that made up this dish were perfect. I could eat this every day.   Luckily my boyfriend acquiesced when I suggested we split an entree. After three appetizers we were already feeling full. We ordered the PDC Melting Pot which I would completely recommend to anyone who wants to try a bunch of different things but don't know what to order. I also highly suggest splitting this meal. Again, we were amazed that food could be made to taste that good. There were 4 different kinds of meat (homemade blood sausage, pork belly, homemade pork sausage, and another cut of pork) all perched atop a bed of fluffy, creamy, cheesy mashed potatoes and caramelized onions with a yummy and light brown gravy drizzled all over the thing. These flavors and textures all together comprised the best thing I will ever put in my mouth. So meaty, so flavorful. The blood sausage was rich and delicious. The pork belly literally melted in your mouth. I thought my boyfriend was going to cry over how good it was. We ordered duck fat fries on the side but sadly hardly touched them. We washed everything down with beer and the best cider I've ever had. We thought our stomachs were at capacity so we ordered the check.   After sitting for awhile and enjoying the company of our fellow restaurant goers (coincidentally the tables on either side of us were from NYC and we all struck up lively conversations about food) Martin Picard comes over to our table and asks us how everything was. I guess we were so inspired by his presence that we mustered up the courage to subject our stomachs to more food, sent our check back and ordered a Sugar Pie and coffee. Great decision. The Sugar Pie was sweet but not overly so. It was creamy, the tart crust was buttery and it was served with refreshing vanilla ice cream. One of the best desserts I have ever had.   Overall, our experience at this restaurant was fantastic. The jovial atmosphere was fun and welcoming. The waiter was GREAT. Friendly and so funny and helpful. Everyone seemed to be having a fantastic time oohing and ahhing at the dishes being served at the next table over from them. At 11pm when we were walking out, the place was still packed.   If you are in Montreal and love food go here. Just go here. The prices are right, the food is other wordly and you will have a ton of fun.   I can't say enough about this special restaurant. I truly doubt any other restaurant I eat at will live up to Au Pied de Cochon."}
{"text":"There are plenty of reviews that go through everything so I'm just going to focus on our good and bad:  Coming from US on a short trip, Couldn't seem to get reservation online a month out so wrote them and they were very gracious and fit us right in when we wanted to come. Excellent  Appearance--from the street it's in between a few other restaurants and no sign so nicely camouflaged unless you know the address.  Inside, some seating in front then narrow row of seating opposite a long bar, comfy, homely, friendly vibe.  Mix of all types of clientele. Smells great inside.    Service--excellent.  We had several different staff swarm us throughout the meal. The main front of house gent (not sure if he is Maitre-D, owner, sommelier) but basically a jack-of-all trades as he was taking orders, explaining the menu, we let him choose our wine and he did a great job on that.  There are other staff food running, clearing, etc.   Very efficient.  We were seated across from the big brick oven and there was a gent slicing fresh hot bread and he kept turning around and giving us more, it was soooo good.   Food--As everyone describes, very rich and filling.  My wife and I have not have much experience with Fois Gras so you have to take our food portion with that understanding as I've read many where people went crazy.  So for us, our favorite course was actually our first, it was a pear and seared Fois Gras appetizer with a maple type glaze, perfectly caramelized.  It was ridiculously good, almost like a dessert it was so good.  I think that was part of our flaw as we ordered mussels to go with that and I don't think the combo of the two suited well together (which was our mistake).  The mussels arrived quickly after the pear dish and I think our sweet tooth from that first dish made the seafood of the second not as complimentary as maybe if we ordered it alone or had it at a different point in the meal.  My wife and I split the Duck in a Can entrÃ©e, and true to reviews, it really does come out in a can, that they open tableside and pour over a pureed cauliflower mixture.  The duck breast I thought was excellent, medium rare it appeared.  My wife struggled with this as she is not a huge duck fan (lack of really eating it vs a like/dislike).  Overall we thought that dish was good but actually liked the first course the best.  Soooooo glad we did not order a 2nd entrÃ©e because we were too stuffed to even have dessert.     One cute thing that we didn't understand is that near the beginning is when they give you the free bread/butter, they put this tiny dish that has what looks like two white tablets in it.   I had no clue what they were, finally a guy came by and poured hot water over them and they unfolded into this cute warm cloths to wipe your hands with.   Just a nice touch that was unexpected.    On my next trip back to Montreal, I'd like to try some of the other dishes like the pork chop, the melting pot, etc."}
{"text":"Really good food.  I tried their foie gras poutine even though I don't like foie gras at all, I thought it was well made. Tasted very fatty and greasy, just the way it's supposed to be.  I also tried a bite of their Beigne Cochon, and it does taste really good. Moist, and just... you just finish that in literally 5 seconds.  Must visit if you can in the future."}
{"text":"While most restaurants that I've been too in my various trips to Montreal have been generally very good, few have set a culinary standard that my visit to Au Pied de Cochon has. I had not been there on the two previous trips but after hearing even more hype about it, decided to make it happen last weekend while in Quebec. I had made a reservation almost two months before the date of the dinner and it was rather easy, done right over the phone. Just a day before the dinner, the restaurant called me to confirm it.  I must admit that I had been looking forward to it for a while after salivating over the menu on their website. One thing that I did notice was how authentic it was; how well it reflected not just the local ingredients, but also the approach and tradition of the Province of Quebec. Anyone reading the menu should easily be able to determine the type of food that you'll be experience and in this case it's rather easy. It features dishes that are somewhat on the fatty but yet very tasty side, something that has helped the locals survive the harsh winters. Some of their proteins offered are bison, beef and also a lot of duck dishes as well. Duck as a matter of fact is their specialty - the culprit dish is duck in a can ($37): a duck breast, a piece of foie gras, some balsamic glaze, some garlic and some thyme, all sealed into a custom-labeled tin can and cooked to perfection. The dish is revealed tableside and is poured from the can and into your plate and the can placed onto the table next to your plate.  But enough on that and more about what I actually ordered and ate.  After taking a good look at the categorized menu, whose dishes are sorted by protein-type, I decided, after much hesitation to get the assiette de cochonailles (pork charcuterie plate). It featured some pickled tongue, three large portions of delicious pÃ¢tÃ©, some headcheese, some pork sausage and even some aspic. On the plate were also half of a hardboiled egg and some corn salsa. At $9.50, it was probably the single greatest value I've ever seen and having eaten most of it, I was already almost full. Everything was great although I was not a big fan of the tongue that I found too pungent - The bread was perfectly toasted and I think that the highlight of the dish was the pÃ¢tÃ© which was out-of-this-world. Not having any idea as to the portion sizes, I was actually going to order more food as their starters seemed very appetizing and were very affordable - their zucchini blossoms ($6) and their foie gras croquemis ($3.50) caught my attention but the waiter told me that I had already enough food in my order, especially since my main course was going to be one of their specials, their lamb shank.   Speaking of the lamb shank, it arrived shortly after and was cooked to perfection; it fell of the bone and was perfectly seasoned. That explained why they didn't upgrade my knife at the table while all six others at the table had been given steak knifes. I didn't need a knife at all; it was fork-tender and delicious. It was served on a bed of green lentils and at only $26, was a bargain considering the volume of the serving and the quality of the food. It was cooked confit-style and was had some tomato on top. It was all delicious and ever so tender, even the lentils were cooked perfectly. I could barely finish it all but somehow managed. In the process, I also sampled some of my friends dishes, as I stated earlier, including the duck in a can and the cassoulet. Both were very tasty dishes and the duck was very flavorful, picking up some of the foie gras flavors in the process.   We did not have room for desserts but all left very satisfied from our food and drinks - Most of us ordered local beers, including their delicious 'Au Pied de Cochon' ale which is brewed in Quebec. It was light, came ice cold and paired well with our meal. The service and kitchen were a bit slow but the service was very, very efficient and although our meal lasted over two and a half hours, our time spent there was amazing. Our waiter even tracked and split our checks into seven individual tabs at the end of the meal which was both impressive and pretty awesome. Saved us from a math-induced headache.  The dÃ©cor is simple and the restaurant doesn't even have it's name in the front and yet it's warm and welcoming. The tables are a bit cramped and the restaurant isn't very wide, but you're able to use a self-serve coat check upon entering before being showed to your table. This restaurant is an absolute gem in a city which already has good food, it excels at reflecting the true colors of Quebec through its menu and dishes. Just remember though, reservations are a must, and should be done way ahead of time. I cannot wait to go back in the future and experience more of their food."}
{"text":"I will be back to Montreal to just visit this restaurant. I've read the reviews and was very curious to try it and I have to admit it is really worth all its hype. AND! This comes from someone who hated foie gras before going there!   As many have noted below, you have to make reservations in advance, I would suggest to call them as soon as you know that you will be going to Montreal. We called a week in advance and the earliest spot they had was 10.30 p.m. on a Sunday night. We got there at 9.30 and they said that we could eat at the bar if we don't want to wait for our 10.30 reservation, we agreed and it was so much fun! You can actually see the cooking process because of the open kitchen, it was a really great experience. That said -- it's by no means a romantic spot. Atmosphere is very cool - it's crowded, noisy and  fun! Service is great and friendly.  Food is OUTSTANDING to say the least. Very unusual combination of flavors! The food is very rich, but honestly, I didn't feel stuffed/sick after I had appetizers, main course and dessert. It was a nice, delicious and very memorable dinner.  We had pickled tongue and  duck carpaccio as appetizers which were beyond amazing. Duck carpaccio comes with raw egg on top which you mix with dijon mustard right on the plate - very different and soooo good! My boyfriend had duck in a can, which was terrific - he saved the can as a souvenir! I had Plogue a Champlain - pancake with potatoes, bacon, cheddar and foie gras topped with maple syrop - it was absolutely amazing. Even though  it was a little too sweet for my taste, I was very happy with the flavors. Desserts were very good too! I also thought it was really affordable, the bill was under $150 for dinner for two with wine, apps and two desserts - pretty good!  Forget about this place if you: -count calories  -are vegetarian -don't eat certain foods -are looking for a quiet romantic dinner  For any foodie, this place is a MUST to say the least. I just came back from Montreal and am already thinking when I should go again to try something new on their menu :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Need a reservation weeks in advance, well worth it!  If you don't try the poutine au foie gras you are not doing yourself any favours!  It's crazy delicious.  I've also eaten the special of the day a couple times...trust this chef, he's good!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by their food truck last week ... Their pountine is great a bit pricey but well worth it"}
{"text":"Okay..I'm not a big fan, but the the selection, presentation and the great drinks make it deserve 4 stars. and on top of all - we were there for forever and no one gave us the feeling that we should leave like most restaurants in the US.   for appetizer we orders the quail. it served whole which is kinda freaky. it tasted like soy sauce. I'm assuming that there was much more than just soy sauce, but it overcome the rest of the flavors. my husband ordered the lobster which he said that it was really good and our friend order the lobster roll which based on the clean plate - he liked it. me and my friend shared the special hen for 2, which should have been hen for 3.. it was very juicy, but the white wine flavor was too sharp for my taste. oh - we also had the mushed potatoes which were very rich and cheesy - not good.   the server was very sales oriented, which was kinda annoying, but that's about it.  average to my taste, but the rest of our party liked it."}
{"text":"Um... left speechless. I'll head back to Montreal for the sole purpose of returning here. I can't really write much else."}
{"text":"Definitely Go.  Excellent food and even better service. I never write about service for a restaurant but I must say that drunk idiots being stupid with the waitresses can normally end poorly but surprisingly this situation was handled with a very graceful manner.   Now the food... Pork Rinds were amazing. Well seasoned and nice and toasty. Tomato Tart not my favorite(mustard flavor was over powering). Foie Gras Poutine - probably the highlight of the night! Dude, Foie Gras of the best quality, seared to perfection, on top of well cooked fries with cheese curd and a gravy that would taste good on a shoe. The gravy had an earthy quality that leads me to believe something other than regular beef base was in it, in a good way. Duck in a Can was what the food prior would lead you to think. It was amazing. The perfect blend of seasonings and herbs with a good mix of stewed vegetables. The duck was definitely fatty considering it is canned with a layer of fat over the duck breast and a considerable slab of foie gras but that only adds to the tenderness of the meat. served atop ... who cares the duck was outstandingly cooked and seasoned. Lamb shank was exceptionally prepared, not the most memorable choice but definitely good.   Dessert did not disappoint either. Pudding Choemer or whatever they call it. It's the maple sauce with a biscuit in it. A MUST HAVE!  All in all it was an excellent experience. The beer was great and the wine selection was very nice as well. I still can't get over how nicely the waitresses handled these clowns who were wasted. The price wasn't bad at all about $100 per person including tax and tip which included 3 beers, 2 glasses of wine, 3 apps, 2 entrees and 2 desserts plus a coffee and a cappucino. Wow that was a lot of food. Oh and last but not least the nice waitress called me a cab after dinner as well."}
{"text":"Oh my god, I miss those little foie gras things. Loved the duck in a can. Delicious. Good on a cold day."}
{"text":"4 stars for service and 1 star for food itself.  We did go in with high expectations because this is highly rated in yelp. Also was recommended in the American Airline destination guide. We ordered the specials- meatloaf topped with a tiny piece of foie gras and the pork chip with mushrooms. Very disappointed with both dishes. The pork chop was way undercooked with blood dripping. And a big piece of fat surrounded the whole chop. We asked that to be redone and the chef said it is not possible. Eating pork raw like that will definitely risk having parasites. No way! We asked to replace with the bison ribs. The server was nice about it.  The ribs turned out ok but really ordinary tasting. Too sweet from BBQ sauce. The meatloaf was wayyyyy too salty. I honestly didn't care for it. Hard to swallow but we didn't want to seem like we are complainers so I just let that go. The foie gras was a tiny piece and was also not done well. Still saw some red with fiber inside. Again didn't complain but sorely miss expectations. They brought us duck fat fries to compensate for my hubby's undone pork chop. That was nice gesture. That was the only thing barely pass. Oh the foie gras croquet appetizer was ok. Not as good as it was hyped up."}
{"text":"TrÃ¨s riche, trÃ¨s gras... TrÃ¨s cher, surtout ce qui est hors menu. Sunday au Homard 65$, bouteille de vin 53$ la moins cher est 50$ et pied de cochon farci au foie gras, 45$, 6$ une frite... Seigneur faut pas virer fou lÃ ! 220$ total avec tips et taxes. Je n'ai pas eu de wow sauf sur le cÃ´tÃ© visuel des assiettes. Pour ce qui est du sunday de homard on se lÃ¢sse vite du goÃ»t et c'est trÃ¨s 'gibelotte' comme style de plat et la plupart des plats son gibelotte. Bref, pour ma part je n'y retournerais pas. Plusieurs considÃ¨re le PDC comme un des meilleurs resto de mtl, Je ne suis pas de cet avis. C'est plus un en droit Ã  touristes, d'ailleurs c'est ce qu'il y avait en majoritÃ©... Service super et ambiance aussi super, super belle terrasse."}
{"text":"It has been a week since we ate here.... And I am STILL talking about this meal!  I have one picture- of an empty plate. Favorite items were:  1. Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e: hands down perfect & I'm a brÃ»lÃ©e snob.  2. Foie Gras Cromesquis: I've never had anything like it. Amazing.   3. Duck in a can: GET THIS! I asked if I could buy these cans to take home... They told me no. Lol!   4. My drink: Bombay, maple syrup & champagne   5. Nigori foie gras.   Rich and felt like a glutton... But well worth it!"}
{"text":"Me: Hi, do you have any reservations available tonight?  Hostess: No, sorry.  Me: Do you have anything available for Saturday?  Hostess: Yes, we have 10:30 at the bar.  Me: I'll take it....is that 10:30am or 10:30pm?    Being shutout at Garde Manger, I had to eat at one of Montreal's best restaurants before I left.  I managed to pace myself (foodwise) so I wouldn't be full at dinner.  The restaurant was packed at 10:30 and we were ushered to our spots at the bar.  We went with the following:  - Foie Gras Poutine (french fries with gravy, cheese curds, and foie gras): poutine is as unique to Montreal as tapas are to Spain and frog legs are to France. The foie gras really elevated the poutine and made it really rich / guilty tasting.    - Happy Pork Chop: Au Pied de Cochon translates to pig feet so I figured that pork was the thing to get (I guessed wrong).  The pork chops were good, but there was nothing special about them.   - Boudin Tart (blood sausage in a tart): this was an absolute surprise (AKA the unintended hit).  The tart resembled a deep dish pizza crust stuffed with cheese, mustard, and perfectly under baked so the dough was fluffy and wet.  I just wished I had more room after dissecting the pork chop.     My only regret was I wished I had ordered the duck in a can - that's definitely not going to be found on a lot of menus."}
{"text":"Whenever I go on a trip with 2 of my homegirls, with one of them and I being Yelpers, we tend to do our research on where to eat prior to going. When we planned for Montreal, we looked at the most Yelped place and Au Pied De Cochon was it. With 200+ reviews and close to a perfect 5 star rating, we knew if we did even just one dinner, it had to be here. My girlfriend called right away to see if we could get a reservation since it was a couple weeks away from our trip. We got lucky! They had a reservation for the Friday we were getting in, but it was for 11 PM and we didn't care!   We arrived about a half hour early to our reservation hoping they would seat us early, but they were so busy that they made us wait till 11 PM. The place has a very laid back atmosphere to it and the lighting is dim. Being that we were having such a late dinner after hours of exploring Montreal we were starved and ended up ordering a feast. From the Yelp reviews, we already knew we had to order the Duck in a Can ($43). When our waitress told us the specials, 2 things that stood out were the Clams in White Sauce and the Pigeon. We ordered those as well as a side order of Fries cooked in Duck Fat ($4.75). The Clams came out first followed up the Pigeon and Duck in a Can. We noticed into our meal that our fries hadn't come out yet and reminded the waitress who was very apologetic. Because I guess she forgot, the fries were on the house. Everything was delicious. The Clams were very fresh and the sauce it was in was soooo good. We were using the bread they gave us to sop up every single bit!  It was my first time having Pigeon and it was different. I was expecting it to taste like chicken but it didn't. Wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite either. The texture and taste were def different than chicken. The dish came with some vegetables. My girlfriends seemed to enjoy it so maybe it was just me. The presentation of the Duck in a can is cool. They bring out the can and open it at your table. Our waiter told us each can that is served was cooked about an hour earlier and then stuffed into the can and sealed. The can contains  1/2 Magret Duck, Foie Gras, Demi Glaze, Buttered Cabbage,  1/2 head of Roasted Garlic, and 2 Branches of Thyme. This was good but VERY rich. I loved the Foie. I'm glad that we had the Fries because I needed a different taste, something bland, which helped to balance these very rich dishes.   Our waitress was great throughout the whole night. When we asked her where would be best to catch a cab, she called one for us. Great service!"}
{"text":"An ode to pork.  We went here on the recommendation of a chef.  My only complaint is that there are too many  delicious indulgences to savor and not enough time or belly capacity to taste it all.  We had an extremely ambitious 5 course meal.   Beef carpaccio, beef bone marrow with caviar,  fois gras poutine...  it was at this point that I lost feeling in my toes and started to slip into a food induced coma.  Then the namesake dish, pied de cochon over casoulet and more fois gras.  It was foodie nirvana!  If you've only got one night in town get around to this place."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie that can eat.  This is the first place that actually got my stomach to Yell for Help!  Food was way too Fatty!  I've heard that this is the place for having a heart attack but I wasn't expecting it to actually do so.  It was so Fatty that after the first 4 servings, I could actually not taste the food in front of my anymore.  It was way too overpriced for what  you got, sorry!  It's an experience but one to be repeated. They not only overcharge but charge people for empty seating (seats reserved but not filled out)."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service but prices are quite steep. For this price level I would go instead to one of Mexico City's fantastic tasting menu restaurants like Biko or Pujol. I would think twice about returning here."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance. Make a reservation if you want a seat. Sat at the bar where the bartender (Vincent) was extremely friendly. Recommended two great wines to go with the Fois Gras (had it seared). The fois gras sauce was a bit much but still great. Also had the Duck in a Can which was excellent. I'll definitely visit this place again. If you're in the greater Montreal area, I recommend you check out these other places: http://bit.ly/pFQdbi"}
{"text":"Just went last week and the food and atmosphere was awesome.  We had reservations at the bar and this was much better than having a regular seat.  You got to watch the chefs make the food, chat with them, and see what was coming out of the kitchen -- a perk was getting the last raspberry goat cheese tart available that night!  I started with the foie gras cromesquis which was one bite with a burst of flavor.  For apps the tarragon bison tongue was amazing - it had a lovely mustard sauce.  For main - Duck in a Can!  Very heavy but delicious.  Dessert was the pudding chomeur, which I could have eaten 5 bowls of -- to die for!  Overall, an excellent meal, but being able to see the making of the food and chatting with one of he cooks (Lee) made it 5-stars!"}
{"text":"Simply the best meal that I've ever had... Absolutely must have the fois Gras poutine, as it's incredibly rich, flavourful, and memorable."}
{"text":"This is a generous two star review. We really wanted to like this restaurant  First the positive:  My husband is a huge fan of pork. Our starter gets five stars... It was the one and only thing we liked. It was an appetizer of thinly sliced housemade prosciutto served side-by-side with amazingly delicious fried pancakes floating in maple syrup. A bite of both together was over the moon. If we'd stopped there this would be a whole different review.  Also of note: our server was very nice and patient when we asked a lot of questions.  Now the gross yucky inedibles:  I really hated the poutine. What is everybody raving about with this dish? French fries that were actually OK on their own smothered in run-of-the-mill gravy and  cheese curds. It's not that I have anything completely against fat, but if it doesn't taste good why bother?  Next came our entrÃ©es:  Mine was a hamburger with foie gras. I'm used to the United States kind where it's a pate and it's all blended together without any look of the organ that it once was. I didn't realize this was going to be the whole organ itself, so maybe it's my bad that I didn't know what I was in for. The bun of the hamburger was deliciously buttery but with all the other food we had eaten it just became overkill with fat upon fat upon fat. I ordered my burger medium and it came out medium rare: red and squishy and lacked the nice chew I am used to in a burger. My husband's entree was a blood pudding tart with foie gras. He generally loves this dish and when I asked him what he ranked it on a 1 to 10 he gave it 2.   Now for our dessert:  We shared a maple pudding for an unemployed person. There was nothing about it that made me want to have a second bite. It was overly sweet, and the texture wasn't good enough to bother eating. In my book it was just gross. If you look at my other reviews you will likely notice that most of them are four and five stars, so this is a real departure for me.  A man who may have been the manager came to our table at the end of our meal and asked if everything was OK. I told him my experience of it and he said something to the effect that maybe I should've had a different dessert. He didn't offer anything, and our tab with the tip was $200.  In defense of this restaurant, the people at the next table shared prime rib of beef for two. It looked absolutely fabulous and was served with mashed potatoes. I was also curious about the lobster. So maybe if you're going to this restaurant and you're thinking about getting some lobster or prime rib you'll have a whole different experience. Good luck if you go"}
{"text":"They don't waste anything... they serve every parts that could be eaten out of pigs. We went here for my birthday dinner and it was pretty interesting.  We had pickles pig tongue, Bison tongue and blue cheese and Apple salad for appetizer. Pickled tongue was not my favorite but bison was pretty good. Loved the salad.  I had the pork chop which was tender and delish, and my husband had a special dish which was pretty much was the pig's leg - pig knuckles, pig shank, meatballs with potatoes and some veggies on the side. It looked like a hearty dish and our French Canadian friend said he had this kind of dish at home growing up.   Make sure to make a reservation. We called one month ahead and they gave us a choice of 5pm or 9pm... popular place. Worth trying at least once, I liked the casual ambiance, but very snug seating. Bathroom situation was odd for the size of the restaurant... one unisex stool with 3 faucet...?"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I have ever been to (if not the best). I had the duck in a can and my friend the risotto. The risotto is mixed in inside a large parmeggiano cheesw block and the duck is cooked inside the can for 27 minutes to a perfect taste. What an experience Service was great too!!"}
{"text":"The best meal I have ever eaten!   Everything was rich, flavourful. I came with a high expectation and the food was beyond my expectation! The service was quick and effective.   I was sitting at the bar. Their kitchen is CRAZY! I don't understand how they can work that effective!!!!   Don't forget to starve yourself before coming here and reservation is a must!!"}
{"text":"Way too much food - and not well prepared and menu made no sense  1. We were there for the apple season but there was only one dessert served with applies. 2. Service was good, consistent and staff friendly  3. reservations were made in April for the October dinner - sold out in 5 seconds flat so if you are interested in attending this smorgasbord anticipate a 6 month or more wait 4. Wine list was extravagant - one bottle at $40 & 60, then over to $80+ 5. Lots of rushing and no chance to settle in between courses 6. we were served a whopping 6 \"entrÃ©es\", 3 main dishes and 5 desserts for our table of 12.   Entrees: First plate was my favourite: cream of tomato soup and cheesy sausage cooked in brioche in a tin can. Flavours blended well and made sense. After that things went downhill fast. Next course was a baked oyster served with something cheesy and a hard lump of foie gras. There was something sugary and odd - waste of a nice oyster and foie gras. Followed by roasted cauliflower with capers and deep fried calves brain - just awful mix of sour and fried soggy sweetbreads. Handmade pasta with pesto, cheese and tofu(!) - another nonsensical blend of over the top. Then there was another pasta dish of one giant black cannelloni made with ricotta (this was well done) - however to slice it up among 6 people just squashed it to death (better to do individual servings in a dish, no?).   By now no one was actually eating much, just dumping it into metal tins to actually eat when they had an appetite. This is not how I like to have a nice dinner.  Main dishes: one roast of pork with an incredible amount of fat still on it, served with carrots. They brought out the roast and did a nice side table preparation. Ate about an ounce, too pink and fatty for me. Next came mackerel served with eggplant and chick peas - I didn't try this dish but made no sense for the menu. Finally a meat loaf of gargantuan proportions: minced pork, wrapped in bacon and a whole brie wheel blended into it served with garlic, brussels sprouts and mushrooms. It was swimming in oil - a mish-mash of flavour and average at best.  Desserts: my second favourite part of the meal and there was nothing left over to take away. One pate amandine with apples and a nice pastry, pear tart with custard, a strawberry pie (teeny tiny for a table of 12), a chocolate tart with blueberries, and two ice cream cakes with meringue walls, topped with honey whip cream. These were fairly well prepared and had a nice blend of flavours.  All this with a $6 glass of cider came to a whopping $70 before taxes.  My suggestion? Skip it and go somewhere else. It was like going to New Orleans: all the fat but without the finesse of the preparations. The menu had no flow to it, many dishes didn't compliment each other and way way way too much food. I tasted most, had a little of each and took NOTHING home."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to the restaurant for years after see it featured on No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain! I mean what's there not to love when the restaurant serves, Duck, Pork and Foie Gras?  Seeing as I was unfamiliar with the area and began my pilgrimage to the restaurant (I knew the food I was about to ingest would be full of fat so I decided to get in my exercise for the day). The restaurant was tucked away in a little street and the hidden restaurant had me walk by several times before I realized I had arrived.  the decor was nicely decorated, small tables on the sides with a home feel to it and you can see the brick oven in the kitchen. The staff were incredible friendly and spent time to have a conversation. They had a a lot knowledge of the menu and gave me some great recommendations. The smell of the pork fat just made me hungry. The restaurant was busy and loud but gave off a fantastic energy.  I had the seasonal maple beer they brewed in house, and it was delicious. Nice balance of malt and maple syrup so it wasn't overly sweet or bitter. Needless to say I had several pints over the course of the night.  I started with Cromesquis de foie gras, this little deep fried cubes of Foie Gras were like little bombs of flavor. The buttery melted foie gras with the deep fried exterior was a unique combination. This is a must have! But make sure you listen to the servers instructions on how to eat them, otherwise you'll burn your mouth and ruin your night!  Temaki de Bison was a braised bison tongue served with Dijon mustard. The bison tongue was coming apart by the fork and was amazingly tender and melt in your mouth. The Dijon mustard gave it the spicy kick that it needed.  My main was the Cured foie Gras & Boudin Tart, the soft foie gras served on top of blood sausages and butter pastry tart was incredible. The foie gras added a slight creaminess to the dish to the dish while the blood sausage added the richness.   Needless to say, I had a foie Gras overload and I had to struggle my way back my hotel! But I would glad go back anytime!"}

{"text":"Short review: terrible excuse for food, barely edible, absolutely disgusting lack of hygiene from the staff. Yet, this was our experience everywhere in this city so maybe it's just fitting for the environment and low standards they have for themselves.   This place was just awful in almost every way.  We arrived 15 minutes late and were seated at the bar to wait, which was no problem at all as it was our fault. The bartenders were friendly to us but completely rude to each other. One was so kind as to figure out all of the specials in English for us and she was reading from a little paper and a girl comes by and snatches it out of her hand. It was rude when she was merely trying to help. 20 minutes after sitting there and trying to ask about different menu items, this one woman (who was to make an appearance later in the evening as well) finally offered us an English menu. The menu itself looked dismal and overpriced.  Good point #1 -- For having to wait at the bar, we were given free snacks (cod fritters; okay) Final being seated at a table with a good view of the open kitchen, we placed an order for the foie gras tart (terrible), onion soup (SO BAD), melting pot (just a bucket of good polenta topped with crumbly, awful blood sausage and a few pieces of okay pork). It was just a terrible experience with the food.  Good point #2 -- The service was great; free fritters, they comp'd my onion soup because I barely touched it, we were even offered a free drink which I turned down.  Good point #3 -- Dessert! Sugar pie with ice cream (a ton of it) and a maple milkshake. It was an aggressive order and we barely Finished it but it was great by comparison to the rest of meal, but nothing worth the trouble of sitting through the rest of the meal.   What negates the whole meal, however, is this; absolutely disgusting good prep staff. We saw a diner drop his knife and a server picked it up and wiped it clean and PRETENDED to grab a new one but really just gave back the dirty one. There were clean knives right there. Needless to say, we wiped our own utensils thoroughly while we choked down the awful food.  We saw a woman bend a pork chop with her hands to check the doneness. The woman who got us the English menus dipped a finger into sauce to taste it and wiped it on her apron.  Same woman, picked up slices of meat and arranged them on a plate with her hands.... I never saw anyone in a public restroom during my stay in Montreal, wash their hands so this doesn't quite sit well with me.   The servers were kind but this type of disgusting behavior negates everything and makes this the worst place I have ever had the pleasure of eating terrible food."}
{"text":"The most memorable meal that we had during our visit in Montreal was here.  ATMOSPHERE: small, casual, busy, noisy, exciting SERVICE: top notch. we sat at the bar and got to see all the action FOOD: just about everything we tried blew our lids off - we bought the book without hesitation"}
{"text":"They were parked just by Place du Canada at around lunchtime. The truck itself is pretty cute with 2 pick-up counters - one for sweets and one for savoury food. Because the weather was a little poor, there was virtually no lineup. I ordered a beignet with haddock and homemade tartar sauce inside for $7. The beignet itself was definitely very cool and just something different, but the tartar sauce wasn't impressive and had a bit too much onions in it, for my liking. The sandwich itself was very juicy and well portioned - a good size (and good price) for a lunch. I'd probably stick to some of their more well-known dishes, for example the foie gras poutine or their sweets as a safer option."}
{"text":"I rarely give fives but this place is deserving of it.  You can tell immediately the head chef or owner takes great pride in this place and it shows. He proudly offered us a tasting menu which and house made brandy which was delicious. The portions are generous and rich. Among my favorites was the pork chop with shrimp and salmon tartar on a pastry.   Highly recommend this place as it is one of the best restaurants I have ever been. The pride in quality shows."}
{"text":"C'est le meilleur restaurant de MontrÃ©al. It's friendly and relaxed like Canadians. But they cook like the French. So it really is the best of both worlds.  I got poutine (the best poutine I ever ate in my life) and some super awesome meats. They also suggested an outrageously awesome wine to compliment my meal.  Love it. Love it. Love it. I'm going back. Someday."}
{"text":"every so often, there are some regrets in our lives - and a good friend never lets you live it down!!!  every so often, i would message my friend  me: Yo. Duck... in a can!!! friend: biatch.  me: Duck... in a can! friend: don't care!!!  --------------------------------------------  so the story goes:  my friend PB was in town, and we decided to show him some good eats in my old stomping ground (Montreal, how I miss your diverse food variety, and all the BYOB places, but not the bitterly cold winters).  Everyone in our group except PB and i ordered the Duck in a Can. For me it just seemed too much goodness that day (i wasn't feeling it).   he thought 'duck in a can' sounded \"gross\", so he ordered something else.  I had the Plogue a Champlain, which are little buckwheat pancakes topped with potatoes, cheese,  bacon, maple syrup & foie gras.  The maple syrup with the richness of the foie gras worked BEAUTIFULLY - i had no regrets about this dish. LOVED it.  My friend, however, turned into a jealous lover when the others got their food... If you've not been here before, they basically take duck, stuffed in the same can container with foie gras, cabbage, some broth and glaze (see other reviewers for complete description). They seal and then pressure cook the can when order, and then bring it to the table and open the can steaming right in front of you! Besides the entertainment value, the duck and foie gras tasts so rich... REAL rich, not Donald Trump-rich. it's truly decadent, fatty and buttery, and not for the faint of heart. But very very yummy.  of course PB tried a taste of it from one of the plates - and was in heaven.   --------------------------------------------  The rest of the week i had to hear all about how he wants to get Duck in a Can and bring it back to SF (unfortunately they seal the can right before cooking it, no preservatives in there so it's not meant to be stored for longer than a day or two). Moaning and bemoaning this elusive \"Duck in a Can\", my friend swore another trip back to Montreal was in his cards to attain this perfection of duck and foie.  it's his Achilles's heel, for every so often, i take a jab and know this scar, this unattained perfection, will invoke that jealous lover's quiet rage and soft sadness, and hopefully will provoke him a step closer to booking his next visit to beautiful Montreal."}
{"text":"Leave your vegan friends home, they will not like this place. Au Pied de Cochon is not for the faint hearted and be prepared to fully indulge.  Au Pied de Cochon gets booked up quickly, so try to make reservations in advanced.  When you're here expect that everything you eat will be extra savory & fatty.  We ended up with a 10pm Saturday reservation booking about a week in advance.   We started with the tomato tartlet which is probably the healthiest dish we tried. The french onion soup was too salty for my taste and took away from any enjoyment.  We followed with the foie gras poutine, my goodness it's hearty and overwhelming.  But wow the flavor is amazing.  They do not cheap out on the foie gras either.  Then we moved onto the special of the night, a 1.5 lb lobster roll topped with foie gras slices and spicy mayo.  This dish again was overwhelming, but the chunks of fresh lobster paired with foie gras was over overpowered by the spicy mayo.  Would definitely recommend ordering without the spicy mayo.   They have this amazing desert of poached pear & vanilla ice cream that cleanses your fatty arteries after your hearty meal of indulgence."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I started planning our trip to Montreal this was the first place we made dinner reservations. The staff at Au Pied de Cochon made sure our hopes and dreams for this meal come true and left us wanting to do it all over again asap!  We arrived 30 minutes prior to our reservation and the hostess set us up at the bar and assured us we would be taken to our table by 6pm. The bartender was incredibly sweet and attentive. She described the menu to us and helped us decide on a dish to accompany our drinks. We ordered one of the specials, the Salmon Head, which was delicious but our least favorite part of the meal (not to take away from the Salmon but it's just that the rest of the meal was THAT great). By the time we were seated we had studied the menu obsessively and long enough to place our order right away. We decided on  Foie Gras Terrine served with apple jelly, Beef Heart Salad, Hot Chicken and my personal favorite, Venison Tartare. My boyfriend is still talking about the Hot Chicken 4 days later... Yea it's that delicious! Lastly, we made the smartest decision we'd made all week by ordering the Pecan Pie, which was served with homemade ice cream. We ate that dessert embarrassingly fast, without uttering a word to one another. All that could be heard during those memorable 4 1/2 minutes were gluttonous slurps, \"mmmmmmm's\" and the scraping of forks on the plate until every last bit of the ooey-gooey pie was devoured. Our meal was everything we hoped for and we will be encouraging anyone going to Quebec to make time for this wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"Debating between 3.5 and 4 stars, but this was a fun dinner - we sat in front of one of the chefs and watched him put all sorts of things into the oven (including two pig heads, which was interesting). We started with the onion soup, which was okay - I think it tasted too much like smoky bacon, which I didn't care for. We also had an incredible mushroom and cheese tartlet with a perfectly dressed side of greens.   For the main course, we got the happy pork chop (which was served with a ridiculously yummy mushroom sauce) and foie gras on top of a buckwheat crepe with potatoes and cheese and maple syrup...and to top it off, it had some of the. best. bacon. i have EVER had in my entire life. yum. We had a mistake with the order, so when we finally got the steak frites we were slightly disappointed - the steak was undercooked and the cut of meat wasn't the greatest - it also had the same mushroom sauce, so it would have been nice to know that in advance. The french fries were perfectly cooked though.   For dessert we had pudding chomeur - a biscuit surrounded by cream and hot maple syrup. Once you start eating it, it crumbles into a wonderful pudding like texture. It was phenomenal."}
{"text":"What more can you say about this place that already wasn't said?  My friend and I were headed to Montreal for the weekend and managed to score reservations for Saturday night at 8:30pm.  We were staying in the Plateau - Mont Royal area which was a 15 minute walk from our B&B.  The entryway to Au Pied de Cochon is a narrow and a bit tight to wait in since there's no waiting area and  it's too cold to wait outside. Saturday night was definitely packed and loud.  If a group of your party is waiting patiently for your table, the hostess will offer your party beers or glasses of wine.  Since we were a party of 2, we opted for the bar to watch the action.  We started out with some cocktails that included maple syrup and since most of these dishes were decadent, my friend and I opted for plates to share.  Based on the recommendation of our waitress, we started out with plogue Ã  champlain which was smothered in maple syrup, topped with foie gras and cheese.  The plate was rich and sweet and for my taste buds, the perfect way to start a meal on a chilly evening.  I recommended my friend try poutine and our waitress recommended it with foie gras but since we already had a dish, it would be overkill and just opted for the classic.  The best dish was the PDC melting pot which was blood sausage, pork belly, and sausage in mash potatoes.  Between the cocktail, PDC melting pot and the plogue Ã  champlain, this one of the first meals in a long time where I refused dessert!  There was definitely no room in my stomach and there's usually a reserve but after experiencing PDC, I am a total devotee of all things Martin Picard."}
{"text":"you gotta love a place where you can walk by and not know what you could be missing out.. there are no signs that point to you this place.. just a packed house of hungry patrons..   we came here and engorged ourselves with food.. we started off with the pickled tongue and the roast piglet.. the tongue was refreshingly light for a pork dish and a great way to start the meal.. the roast piglet was really tender but could have been seasoned a bit better or have a better dipping sauce.. nevertheless it was delicious..   for our entress.. we shared the stuff pied de cochon with foie gras as well as an order of blood sausage.. the pig's feet were really really heavy and hearty.. we used the gravy and slathered it over the duck fat fries and it was heavenly fattiness..   as for the blood sausage.. it was rich as well and velvety smooth.. and if i dare say.. better than the pig's feet.. it was well seasoned and paired nicely with the apples..   for dessert... we got the poached pear.. which was good..   oh yeah.. i just found out anthony bourdain featured this place on his show no reservations.. i guess i shouldn't be surprised"}
{"text":"When my friend and I were certain we wanted to try Au Pied de Cochon, I tried to make reservation (1 week in advance) but their voicemail box was full... I didn't know what to do except, trying to call in the following days... And finally, 2 days before the date we wanted to go, I was finally able to make a reservation (but there weren't any tables left, and the lady asked me if it was okay to be seated at the counter/bar, which I was fine with).  Being seated at the counter/bar was actually one exciting experience since we were able to watch the chefs cook and take a glance at all the dishes other customers ordered! It was really mind-blowing watching them cook in a fast-moving environment! I really liked their open-kitchen. It was also fun to guess whether the dish was ours or not too (it was our first time at Au Pied de Cochon, so we didn't know what to expect!)  Before coming to Au Pied de Cochon, I searched other people's reviews and made my mind that I wanted to try their Duck in a Can! And this was one of the two dishes we ordered. We didn't know what to order next and my friend thought the The PDC Melting Pot has an interesting name, so we ordered that! Our waiter served us bread and butter (we didn't eat a lot since we wanted to save the tummy for our main courses, but the bread was not too hard, it was perfect!)  Duck in a Can:  Ordered it like I said because a lot of reviews said it is a must there! It is without doubt an interesting and fun dish. It came in a heated can (like how the name of the dish suggested). So, the waiter brought it over and opened it in front of you, poured the content out of the can (which contains the duck breast, 100g of foie gras, cabbages, the sauce) over the bread with carrot and cauliflower purÃ©e.   The meat was really tender and it went very well with the cabbage, especially when you eat it with a small piece of duck meat. I actually really like the cabbage! It balanced the richness of the duck meat and foie gras very well. The fat under the duck meat was so chewy (I like chewy stuff) but the other fat part was.... I didn't like it since it was too greasy but some people like the feeling of fat melting in the mouth. We finished the dish (expect for the fat part) since it was too much for us.  Duck in a can was quite an experience to be honest, it might not be my favorite dish due to its richness and especially oiliness but it was definitely an unique and interesting experience due to the presentation of the dish in a can!  PDC Melting Pot: We actually preferred the melting pot because the taste wasn't as heavy as Duck in a Can and the pot was full of surprises, which made it more interesting. This dish came in a pot which was already hinted with its name! There was pork sausages, shiitake mushrooms, buttery potato cheese which was like mashed potatoes with cheese at the bottom, blood sausage -boudin but it is not like the Asian style one-, pork belly (so yummy!), pork loin and onions.   There were a lot of things inside the pot; a lots of surprises! I absolutely loved the \"buttery potato cheese\", it was so delicious and well-made! The pork was tender and everything in this pot went extremely well with the mashed potatoes! The onion sauce was perfect too! It was a rich dish but not overwhelming like Duck in a Can.  We also ordered their Milkshake XXX. My thought of my first sip: this is quite sweet... But afterwards, it got better! I don't know what was inside this milkshake... It tasted like rum (I'm not sure if it contained alcohol though). This was one rich milkshake I would say!  We were basically in a food coma after this! I would definitely like to come back again and try their bison tongue (saw good reviews about it!)  P.S: Make sure to make a reservation!!! Keep on trying even when their voicemail box is full!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a french restaurant with a QuÃ©bÃ©cois twist--- Au Pied de Cochon is the place to be.  You also need to be a meat eater as this restaurant is not vegetarian friendly.  I made my reservation for 10:30PM the night after Xmas as that was the only thing available.  If you want to make a reservation, do so by email as no one ever picks up the phone.    Photos is the best thing to do here.  Portions are ginormous and everything is super heavy.  Main dishes are best shared, anything for 2 is really good for 3 or even 4.  I had the Stuffed PDC w/ Foie Gras and I couldn't even get through a quarter of it myself.  Do yourself a favor and skip breakfast AND lunch before you come here for dinner.  I'm not even kidding.  Ordering apps is a great way to lighten the main dishes load and try more of the menu.  The duck fat fries and cod fritters come served in a cone made from pages out of Martin Picard's award winning cookbook.  I wiped them down and saved them-- hoping that one day I'll attempt to make some Mille Feuille.  Tomato tart tastes like a personal pizza, the foie gras in the croquette is in liquid form so that was interesting.  I forgot to order the boudin tart!  =/  If you love foie gras, it's very easy to get trigger happy here.  There are 9 dishes w/ foie gras!  The foie gras croquette was bite sized and a cheap thrill @ $3.50 a bite.  I felt it was unnecessary with my stuffed PDC, too indulgent with the poutine, slimy and odd with the duck in a can, etc.  Nonetheless-- it's tough to find foie gras on any menu in NY, never mind this many options and at such reasonable prices.  So take a dive and see what you think.  Duck in a can is worth the hype.  It's a generous portion and we found it to be quite the spectacle.  Still amazes me how everything is cooked perfectly coming out of the can but it was and that duck breast is to die for.    PDC it's the name plastered on the walls so I had to try it.  Best when shared in a group of 3 or more.  Be patient as it takes 45 mins to prep.  It's really not pigs foots, more so the pigs leg that you are eating.  It's a big serving.  The skin has a light crisp straight out of the broiler but the meat and tendons have a soft, waxy texture from it being cooked just right.  It's served on a bed of mashed potatoes and marinated champignons.  The tough decision at the end is whether or not to box the leftovers.  I passed on it as I think I've reached my pigs foot limit for the year.    Hard to do but try to make room for dessert.  Everyone praises the sugar pie and such but I had no room left at the end."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Probably one of my favorite meals ever, everything was delicious! If you are in Montreal you HAVE to eat here! We lucked out sitting at the bar (they called it the chef's table) and had eyes on the meal preparation. It was an exciting and vibrant atmosphere and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had a return visit.  Things were still good as always, great beers on top including a house made stout that was more like a chocolate milkshake.  Fish of the day was a spectacular fresh catch with homemade gnocchi.  I never thought I could get full on eating fish but this one here you could.  The duck carpaccio though is exquisite including a raw egg on top with some horseradish and mixed in hot sauces..  I will say though there poutine is kind of a disappointment.  I found it too salty.  As always the place is a monument to excess.  I can't go back cause the food's just too much, but it is someplace everyone should see.  However, I have had my fill... I am done!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant after trying their sugar shack  I brought my aunt for her bday and this restaurant didn't disappoint  There was an issue with our reservations even tho I had confirmed and It seemed like I wasn't the  only one with that problem.  Tip: Reserve early but verify more than once if they got it right    *Do not go there if your doctor put you on a diet * *Do not wear a crop top like I did*  *Do wear maternity pants*  Every dish we tried was a knock out of the park  We had the blue cheese salad as an appetizer  Then we had the foie gras poutine and that's exactly when earth stopped turning for me.  If my mum didn't teach me better I would have just licked the sauce right off my plate and ruin my name for at least 3 generations.  After that, we shared the cote de porc and pdc mashed potatoes.  We closed the show with their \"pet de soeur\" sugar pie.  We had our wine by the glass because we have different wine style.  I find it very fair for the price.  After this meal, we couldn't walk and we couldn't breath But it was one of my sweetest summer memory"}
{"text":"We made reservations way ahead of time prior to our trip to Montreal. Our reservation was at 8:30 but even then we still ended up waiting for another 30-40 minutes until we were seated - but the hostess was really sweet and checked in regularly to let us know they would seat us soon. While we were waiting, a few groups arrived without reservation, asked the hostess to place them on the last slot of the night which was I think about 10:30, and the hostess was able to take their names down.  On to the food...  Cromesquis de foie gras - basically deep fried cubes of liquid foie gras. Comes with 2 servings - which we were instructed to wait for about a minute, pick it up with our fingers; no utensils; and place it in our mouth. Basically an explosion of liquid foie gras goodness in your mouth. It's a nice introduction and starter to our meal.  For the appetizer we got the tarragon bison tongue - so tender; the meat melts in your mouth.  We also got the foie gras poutine - which of course is so decadent and basically so yummy. Unlike everyone - I had not fallen in love with poutine but this dish was definitely worth it to have and if all poutine was served like this then maybe I would be a convert.  Duck in can - of course we had to try. Neat presentation. The duck breast was flavorful and cooked perfectly. The foie gras is of course so decadent and melts in your mouth. So so good.   PDC's melting pot - which is sort of a sampler that includes pork chop, pork belly, blood sausage, another type of sausage with sort of a thick stew/sauce over it and served over a bed of really good mashed potatoes. This dish was good with really rich and deep flavors but nothing that was overly impressive for me.  For dessert, we ordered the poudding chomeur - sort of a maple bread pudding, which came out piping hot. Super sweet but I love anything maple at this point.   So definitely one of my favorite eating experiences while in Montreal. Really busy restaurant with a nice quaint atmosphere. Hostess and servers are super attentive. Prices aren't too bad - we spent a little over $150 for 2 people."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous in the best way possible.  It's so rich and filling, I could barely eat the next day.  I could have totally sufficed with the appetizers, which were an incredibly good duck carpaccio and venison tartare in some insane Japanese presentation.  Both were very rich and rich in flavor.  The foie gras was excellently prepared, and the main taken \"Pied de Cochon\", aka pigs foot, was enough to feed at least 6 people, comfortably.  It came in a sauce that reminded me of extra good French onion soup.  The desert which was a dense white cake in an extra tasty maple caramel pudding was fantastically decadent.  I could not believe I could actually eat it, but it was so fantastic, I could not stop eating it.  This place is a true experience.  A mix between Quebecois and Decadent French food."}
{"text":"This place was spectacular...after reading the mixed reviews, I wasn't hesitant, but certainly not over the moon excited about going.  The place is fantastic, and it exceeded my expectations. That's what its all about right? Expectations?  I had the bison tongue, foie with buckwheat pancakes and the horse tartare for my main. The foie was simply fantastic...balanced, rich and classy. Everything else was great too. We had a nice Bordeaux  GREAT food, GREAT atmosphere, GREAT staff. Can I give it 6 stars?"}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon is an institution owned by Wild chef Martin Picard.His love for Pork,Foie gras & Maple syrup reflects in most of his dishes.Pied de Cochon means \"Pigs foot\". The food here is Heart stopping..... Literally. If you are a health freak, this place is not for you. Most of the dishes here are capable of putting you into a food induced coma. We started with a Maple bourbon daiquiri. Ordered the BC oysters, Duck fries & Tomato Tartlet. The BC oysters were big and fresh. Also the sauce it came with was very flavorful. The duck fries were kinda meh. I've had better. The Tomato tartlet was very rich, flaky & full of flavor. For mains we ordered the Lobster roll with foie gras, The Bison rib, Duck in a can & Pied de cochon. My favorite was Duck in the can. Duck breast with skin marinated in foie gras and served on a bread. Was very rich. A bit too rich for a couple of my friends, But I enjoyed it.The Bison rib was really good. One giant rib cooked to perfection. The lobster roll was good. The buttery flavor and foie gras make it very heavy. Pied de Cochon was pork with foie gras on a bed of mashed potatoes and foie gras infused mushroom gravy. We couldn't finish it all. It was an amazing experience. I OD'd on meat. Now have to go on a detox diet for a week. But was TOTALLY WORTH it.    Food : Gastronomically delicious Service :Great Ambiance : Casual/Loud Worth the price : Yes"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  We had: -duck in a can (flavor of sauce reminds me a little of collard greens however the duck was a bit tough and the skin was unappealing) -bison tar tar (wrapped like a japanese hand roll, kind of bland and nothing special) -beef tongue (seared, tasted like any other place that sears it) -foie gras burger (heavy, rich and messy but tasted amazing. the foie gras was thicker than the beef patty)  We sat on the table right in front of the kitchen with the mirror. Our waitress kept checking herself out every chance she got. She did so while talking to us, taking our order and following up on the food. Caught her a few times walking by our table and doing the same thing. Quite funny actually. If you end up in that table, prepare to have no eye contact or any sincerity from the waitress.   Oh and we saw that fat dude from the Bourdain show that took him around Montreal sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"This restaurant looked very promising when i typed in \"best french restaurants\" in Montreal. Unfortunately, i feel like its a bit hyped up/ overrated. I am being generous for giving it 3 stars, it is probably just not my cup of tea.   Location/ Ambiance: - it gets packed  - noisy - trendy/ more of a hipster feel  -very cramped - restrooms are a bit slippery and inconvenient since its right behind the bar   Food: 1.) Foie Gras Poutine - the fries, gravy and cheese were excellent.. the foie gras was pretty good. 2.) Bison Tongue - not really my type, it has a very EARTHY taste... i couldnt even swallow it. 3.) Herring - its very good - love the taste, a bit sour and little bit of sweetness. 4.) Au Pied de Cochon - also very earthy - we only ate 1/4 of it. If you like an earthy taste - you might like it.. But its definitely not for me.   Service: Excellent - staff is very friendly and helpful. Although we made reservations ahead of time but when we got there we still had to wait for at least half an hour for our table.   Price:  Expensive for what it is. Sorry PDC."}
{"text":"My actual rating is 3.5 stars, I rounded up to give them the benefit of the doubt. It can be problematic to visit a place like Au Pied de Cochon that is so heavily hyped and known by foodies. How can any meal live up to the expectations? Our meal was solid with some delights and slight disappointments.  We booked four weeks out. Arriving on foot, we walked right by the place, as there is no sign (I like that).  We arrived at our appointed hour, but had to wait another half hour. For part of the wait, we were given a seat at the counter with a direct view of the controlled chaos of the open kitchen. The brigade was dressed in dark blue Dickies workshirts with name patches like one find at a garage. They were working feverishly. I noted the fry station seemed to be holding items longer than is best for freshness, something we would experience firsthand. While quaffing a local beer (St. Ambroise Pale Ale) we watched the different dishes coming out of the kitchen and started to formulate a plan.  Once at the table, we decided to order more items but split them. We ordered the famed poutine with foie gras, a tomato tart, fried zucchini blossoms (with the small zucchini attached), the PDC's melting pot. Half of the dishes were okay and half were excellent. The poutine was luke-warm, had just a few fries and the foie gras was not of the highest grade, having a fairly coarse texture. The blossoms were thickly battered, not the tempura batter that we had expected. They were also pretty greasy. The tomato tart was fresh and perfectly crafted: a good counterpoint to heavy food. The PDC's melting pot was the star with four kinds of pork plus roasted mushrooms and onions on a bed of mashed potatoes, which ended up being aligot: Auvergne style (cheese enriched) mashed potatoes all in a cocotte. Our favorite cut was the pork belly, but all were exemplary and we enjoyed the variety. Several tables had the pig's head for two, which I am sure was tasty, but my wife was not really up for the visuals for us to order it.  A table of four sat near us, which provided considerable humor. Two couples of asian gangstas talked up a storm of stupidity. The guys tried to impress the women who were preoccupied with playing video games on their phones. They ordered a bottle of wine which they promptly sent back stating it was \"sour\" (not big fans of acidity, I guess, which might have helped them enjoy their heavy meal). Behind them, a Japanese couple spent the entire time fiddling with their iPhones while eating: never talking with each other.  We ordered poached pear with vanilla ice cream and a cappuccino. The poached dessert was perfection, but the cappuccino was nasty. Super darkly roasted espresso, no steamed milk and a cap of fluffy dry foam.  In summary, it was a good meal with ups and downs. It was not the finest pork dish nor the best foie gras I have ever tasted, but it may have been an off night. To their great credit, the prices are shockingly reasonable. Given the crushing popularity, they could charge twice as much and still pack them in."}
{"text":"When I mentioned to friends I was going to Montreal everyone ask are you eating at \"Au Pied du Couchon?\" I guess everyone watched the episode with Anthony Bourdain as did it so of course I rsvp!   The pack and bustling restaurant was in full swing. People running food to tables and the line out the door at reception all clamoring to get a table.  If you didn't have a rsvp on the night we went, you didn't have a chance. They were running a bit behind. We were seat 30 minutes after our reservation at 10pm.   The packed restaurant service was a bit slowish but overall friendly. We weren't in a rush but the host did eventually make his way to our table. We ordered a beer to start off which came fairly quickly and water was always topped off. We wanted to start with the foie gras Cromesquis but it never showed up. Thankfully, the Bison Temakii which was veal on the night we went was very good. Excellent flavors and a nice start to the meal in addition to the amuse bouche. The melting pot is a pot full of goodness with different selections of pork and boudin on top of the creamiest, velvet smooth mashed potatoes I've ever had. My table mate wanted a second helping because it was that good. The pork chop was moist, seasoned and cooked to perfection. Our order of side vegetables never came but we remembered to inquire about it unlike the foie gras. Once it did appear, the medley of root vegetables was a perfect accompaniment to the meal as the meal could use some greens but it would have to do.  While I don't usually eat this late with the meal finishing at 1am! The meal was satisfyingly good. Nothing was over seasoned and I have to admit the mashed potato was darn amazing.  Even with the wait, missing orders Au Pied du Couchon is impressive and certainly one not to miss if you are in Montreal and a carnivore."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out as many friends suggested I check it out.  Their duck in a can is really delicious.  It is literally a duck cooked in a tin can and then opened in front of you.  However the pork chop dish was just okay.  It was a bit dry and not very tasty.  The fries were tasty.  Their apple pie dessert was great.    Overall, it is a very good restaurant with great menu items, if the pork was a bit tastier, would definitely have given this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"All I'm going to say is you better have the Poutine!!!!  A must go place when in Montreal for anyone. Expect to wait awhile to be seated but as you'll find out it's well worth the wait.   Cheese mash potatoes OMG.   Atmosphere? It's ok. I didn't go there for that. The food is sublime. I go every time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"You know you are already asking for trouble if you enter a small, fancy, restaurant with a stroller and a 7 month old.  Yet I gave PDC the heads up before hand, and  they didn't have a problem.   By my tone you might think a problem eventually developed. . .the answer is no!. We all sat comfortable, we had great service, and the staff seemed to love our child as much as we did.   So our tip if you come with a young one, go for the 5pm sitting.  It is worth it.  The food, as always, was so wrooong it was good. Tasty foi gras, great pig.  and fish and bacon. . .you can't go wrong.  Even the Food Network Star himself was there (though he spent all his time in the bar area. . .trying to fix the mixing/drink machine)  My kind of restaurant. This was the second time I went to PDC (the first was a 3 guys b-party).  Well worth the trip, but if you ate here every weekend you would be dead by 40."}
{"text":"Went for a special occasion dinner. The space is very loud and crowded. As an English speaker I was a bit disappointed by the service staff's ability to explain dishes (the menu is very non-descript). We had a reservation and were seated promptly at the bar (be aware that a two top with a reservation may end up at the bar). The bar is very tightly sat - and there is barely any room behind you so those with long legs may be uncomfortable. Being at the bar means you're in the thick of it - lots of banging, broken glasses, people waiting to use the bathroom or register.   The server recommended too much food - she specifically said that the portions on two of our dishes would be very small - they were not. We're used to high-end restos serving portions that are much smaller. So that is to say, their portions are generous - but we felt bad not cleaning our plates at the end of the meal.   Drinks: -Cocktails are tasty but too sweet - as avid cocktail drinkers it was nice that they had 5 to choose from but they were all sweet drinks and maybe only one featured whisky which is odd considering the menu.  -Wines by the glass were pricey - but tasty.  On to the food: -Pate de Campagne - typical country pate, similar in flavor to many others I have had. Nothing unique flavor wise but tasty nonetheless.  -Fois Gras Poutine - delicious FG and gravy. Rich enough to share between 2-4 people with other small plates.  -Venison Tartare - we're big tartare fans and the flavored here did not disappoint. However, the portion was larger than any I've ever seen. It was enough for 6 to 8 people to snack off of - not the typical app size dish we're used to - perhaps this could have been explained by the server when we ordered. The accompanying salad was pretty but too oily - I didn't get a chance to ask what was in the dressing but it needed more acid to cut through the richness of the oil/fat. Either way, it was too much food and we would have rather paid $10 less for half the portion.  -Duck in a can - one of their signature dishes. It's rather novel to have the duck poured out of a can at your seat. Flavors were savory and warming - would have been a more appropriate winter dish. The huge serving of FG included didn't hurt. Again, by this point in the meal it was just too much - too rich, too much quantity.   Overall, the flavors were great. We could have been served half as much food and been satisfied. The service was efficient but not warm. I most likely would not return if I was paying."}
{"text":"This place was lovely with a wonderful staff and the food was great. We sat at the bar and were entertained by the waitresses/bartenders mixing up various drinks. One cocktail that caught my eye was the strawberry daiquiri, so I requested one for myself and it was delicious.   These were the food items we ordered. I recommend all of them. 1. The pig head that came with lobster over mash potatoes and carrots 2. Cromesquis de foie gras 3. Temaki Tartare"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Au Pied de Cochon is a very lively restaurant. If drinks and fat in surplus is what you live for, you will love it here.  I was lucky to visit with a friend of the chef so I have no knowledge about making reservations; only that you really need one and they are difficult to get.   We sat at 9:30 on a Wednesday evening. It is a cute, small restaurant. Very narrow walking areas and difficult to hear. The music is quite loud. While all this adds to the vibe, I found it frustrating to not be able to understand the waiter or the people next to me at times. Certainly not a \"romantic\" evening spot.  That said, the food is delicious, if very excessive. There is so much foie gras on the menu that it becomes shorthand to \"fg\".  Overall, I found the food rich, too rich to me. There are no fruits or vegetables anywhere; just protein and fat. (Parsley was the ONLY green thing I saw all night long on a plate.)   For some, this is heaven. For me, almost sickening. I love that the chef is true to himself though and doesn't worry about catering to everyone. He makes what he loves and forgets the rest.   The wait staff is polite and helpful, explaining many things on the menu and patient with kids or large groups.  We tried many, many things. The highlights?  Maple soda. I did not see this on the menu but was offered it by the waiter because I passed on the alcohol; it is homemade and amazing! Bubbly, refreshing, not too sweet. The perfect cut against fat.  Foie gras poutine - the gravy it out of this world rich and delicious  Foie gras fried bites - I forget the exact spelling but they were perfect piping hot squares of heaven. A MUST order  Seafood dumplings - a special that day; like dim sum with maple syrup on top. Amazing.  Seafood platter - we ordered the \"small\" and it was still huge. so many things to try on it. A perfectly cooked octopus which is very difficult.  Sugar pie - sweet, custard pie that is really scrumptious!  The duck in a can was just okay to me - but I was overloaded by that point. Duck carpaccio was good. Bison tartare hand rolls were interesting with quail egg yolk - looked beautiful.  ---  I would return if someone wished to, but not at the top of my list. It's just not my cup of tea. Everything was cooked well and interesting, I just need more vegetables and fruits.  Everyone else in the group was on cloud 9 though, and so for that, I only deduct for the atmosphere, which is too loud to enjoy fully.   P.S. Only one bathroom made wait times long, and no temperature control on the water. Washing hands in almost boiling water is so painful and almost made my kid sister cry. Ouch!"}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon is a restaurant founded by Chef Martin Picard back in '01, offering some new Canadian comfort fare.  The menu revolves mostly around the different parts of the pig, such as the pickled tongue, boudin, tarts, pork chops, pig's head, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras, etc.  I made advanced reservations, and the hubs and I came here for a later dinner after we landed in Montreal.  We started off with the Fg Poutine, which was a plate of freshly-fried fries, topped with a lovely foie gras sauce, cheese curds, and generous chunks of foie gras - this was decadent, but not too heavy, and the gravy was super delicious.  For the main meals, we tried one of their specials, the Croque Monisuer with roasted pork loin and French toasts with maple syrup - we were not fans of this, as it just had too much going on; I wasn't a fan of the pork and the taste of it, as well as the oversweetness from the maple syrup-drenched toasts.  We then tried the Hot Chicken - this was pretty tasty, as the chicken itself was cooked perfectly and was super juicy; the salty crispy skin exterior had tons of flavor, and I loved the thick nice au jous-type of gravy that was drenching everything - I'm a huge peas fan, so the fact that there was an overabundance of this just made my heart happy!  For dessert, we tried the Milkshake with PDC Maple Toffee (one of the best milkshakes I've had, this wasn't too thick and easily drinkable - the taste was a mixture of funnel cake/creme brulee and something just magical - not overly sweet, but decadent enough), and the Maple Poudding Chomeur (love little bread pudding that had a yummy crunchy exterior, the hubs was a total fan of this!).  I'd love to go back and try out their Happy Pork Chop (which they were out, sadly), as well as their Duck in a Can.  Service was super friendly and attentive, as Gregoire and Louis were both fabulous.  We even received multiple complimentary bread (that had a lovely crust to it - rustic and yummy, it was great with the soft butter that was served).  The place is open late and it does get packed - reservations are highly recommended.  +yummy complimentary crusty bread :D +Foie Gras Poutine :D +Hot Chicken :D +Milkshake with PDC Maple Toffee :D +Maple Poudding Chomeur :D +ask for Gregoire and Louis :D +friendly staff +reservations highly recommended!"}
{"text":"amazingggggggg! Delightful food and wonderful service. What a memorable meal. Only downside was that it was a little $$$$. Great as a part of my anniversary trip and a wonderful celebratory spot!!"}
{"text":"I'll return to Montreal for a few reasons...pain au chocolat, suger pie, poutine...but the most important one is: au pied de cochon.  And yes, returning to Montreal would require flying across the country from LA to have a wonderful meal, yummy wine, and scrumptious dessert.  It was good...really good.  foie gras yumminess, steak frites delishness and wonderful dessert ...sidenote: I never try to drink wine from california when i'm not at home...but a recommendation from a delightful waiter topped off my meal with a great glass of wine.  sigh...I want to go back!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my most interesting food adventures.  We got the Foie Gras poutine, Duck in a Can, and the Melting Pot.  First, word of advice to those new to foie gras: don't order more than one dish with foil gras. It's quite rich and you can't eat a lot of it. The Duck in a Can dish has 100g of foie gras.   Our favourite dish was the Melting Pot. So much sausage and pork all over the most delicious mashed potatoes you'll ever have. And it wasn't so overbearingly rich like the Duck in a Can.   The Duck in a Can is a pretty fun, interesting dish. But for my tastes, it's just too oily and fatty. Our server actually congratulated us for finishing as much of it as we did (which was almost all of it). Some parts of it I found difficult to eat due to its richness, but it was otherwise delicious and unique.  Service is good, especially considering how busy they are. And it was really fun sitting at the bar in front of the open kitchen. I was surprised how small the kitchen was for a restaurant this size.  I would definitely like to come back to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to check out PDC since we moved to Montreal about  a year ago.  We finally made  it a couple of nights ago. It was a relatively cold night (~-10) and as soon as we got in we were struck by the amazing smell of food and the warm cozy atmosphere and the buzz of tables and the  waiters running around.   Walking in, the most striking feature is the brick oven in the kitchen at the heart of the restaurant. Luckily, we sat right next to the kitchen, best spot IMO for 1st visit, and got to watch all the dishes coming out of the kitchen.    Before i ramble about the food, i should point out that the service was excellent: i saw about 6 servers working together in an  impressively cohesive manner. Everyone was kind and friendly and they answered all our questions patiently with a pleasant dose of humor.  Sadly, all daily specials were suitable for groups of 3 or more (or 2 really really hungry people who don't care too much about dessert). For this reason and generally the generous size of the dishes, i think the restaurant is experienced more fully by groups of 4 or more.  We got foie gras poutine, tarragon tongue, duck in a can, maple creme brulee and maple pudding chomeur.   The poutine was the best I've had in Montreal. The froie gras totally melted in my mouth and the gravy was rich, tasteful and satisfying.   The tarragon tongue included about 5 thin pieaces of tongue, sitting in a hearty sauce garnished with a few small pieces of carrots and pickles.  The tongue pieces were tender and juicy, and the sauce was the kind of flavor you wanted to taste as slowly as possible so that maybe you'll get to know it better  :D it was rich, smooth and sophisticated.    I think duck in a can is a classic at this place. Half a duck, foie gras, cabbage and garlic  have been sitting together in a can until they are boiled for about half an hour and served on a piece of crunchy bread and sweet potato puree. Sure, the duck is rare and tasty, but the rest, the mixture of cabbage and garlic marinated in duck fat and broth in a can with a bit of crunch bread is the kind of homey flavor that might be worth dying for, gastronomically speaking!  I'm not a fan of maple pudding chomeur and i have to admit PDC didn't change my mind: it is just bland, pointlessly sweet and without a texture at all. Creme brulee was nice but not the best I've had: the custard was ok  but half the caramel was burnt black. It's very sad when a meal doesn't end on high note  So, yes i want to go back soon, ideally before summer starts and with a group of fun friends to share more dishes with :)"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar.  We ordered duck in the can, poutine, and cherry foie gras.  All were good, the foie gras was exceptional.  Sitting at the bar, we had a great view of the kitchen.  This turned out to take away from the experience.  We noted the unsanitary habits of one kitchen staff.  E.g.  using the same cutting board for both meats and tomatoes for their burgers.  Wiping the board with a towel which he then kept wrapped around his neck.  The waitress was nice and helpful.  A bit slow in the end.  Overall, a good experience bcs the food was good."}
{"text":"This is one restaurant that I was really looking forward too and have been wanting to go to for a while now. I noticed restaurants in Montreal are very hidden/in random areas of town. So dont be surprised if your in a residential area while your looking for the restaurant.   Anyways, first thing is first they take your coat, and seat you. After ordering from the menu they continuously supply you with bread and butter (amazing. but I stayed away knowing it would fill me up).   Apps were were good (nothing special). It's the mains that killed me. On a good note the food portions are massive for what you pay. And very filling. So please only stick to 1 main dish if it's for yourself. That may even be enough for 2. I respect this. The thing that killed me was the way they food was prepared. I ordered the pied de cochon, and while the inside was nice and tender, the outside was dry and crispy. Nearly uneatable.  The boudin was very dry as hell, and it could have used a little more of that sweet cabbage/Onion(?) to cut it a little.  We had other things on the menu that were also so so.  Honestly come here, but I wouldn't spend money to purposely go to Montreal just to eat here.   This is the only place Ive been to in which I might return to (just to try the foie items)  even though I had such a bad experience (foodwise)"}
{"text":"if you had told me that one day, i would be sitting at a meal and saying 'no more foie gras, please' i would have taken my one white glove (because i tend to lose things), and slap you across the face, and said with my ridiculously fake french accent 'non non!  but zat is rideec-u-lous, mon ami!'  as everyone has said, the place is fabulous.  it's rustic meets forward.  the Plogue Ã  Champlain style of foie is a fabulous combination of sweet and savory.  i could eat this for the rest of my life.  or until i die from a massive heart attack or stroke.  the duck in a can was wonderfully flavorful, but it was the presentation that made the dish so wonderful.  and the poutine.... man, the poutine.  there's something just so ridiculous and delicious about a dish that piles fat on top of fat on top of fat.  dessert was the least successful part of my meal... maybe i should have had another chunk of foie instead!"}
{"text":"Fois and decadence to the max! So over the top in the best way possible!"}
{"text":"I Was in Montreal one weekend and actually got a reservation to this place. I've been trying to get a table here for quite some time so I was super excited that I was actually able to go.   It's not really that big of a place, and the decor seems to scream that they've need out cutting wood recently.  I sat at the bar, and got the watch all the magic of the kitchen.   I decided to read what the other yelpers were saying and ordered the fois gras appetizer cubes (sorry no idea what they're called [cromesquis] *Thanks Devan R.), the duck carpacho, and the fois gras poutine. I decided to stay away from the duck in a can from previous reviews. Ps do you see a trend? It's fois gras and duck.   The appetizer literally exploded with flavour in your mouth. They tell you to let it sit for a while (cause it's literally a deep fried cube of fois) to avoid burning your tongue off. Wow, the flavour of the fois was so rich and balanced. A must order.   The duck carpacho was alright I guess, it reminded me of a deconstructed steak tartare, only more bland. Flavours of shallots, salt and egg kinda overwhelmed the dish. The duck was lost. Maybe don't order this.   The fois gras poutine probably put me over the top. There was a generous portion of fries, gravy and a lot of fry shaped fois gras. Personally I found this dish way too salty. The combination of the saltiness of the gravy with the saltiness of the fois gras was overwhelming. Besides that, this dish is SUPER rich, like Donald trump style. You could probably just order this and be good.   Other than the food, they also have their own micro craft beer that I had a chance to try. It wasn't bad, hoppy and bitter aftertones (kinda Czech style) if you like that sorta thing.   Would I come back? Ya I probably would just to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Heard lots of great reviews for Au Pied de Cochon. This restaurant was featured on one of the shows by Anthony Bourdain! Service was excellent.  DRINKS: Pied de Cochon beer x 2  TERRAINE OF FOIE GRAS (4/5) Came with jam and bread. So delicious - it's pure foie gras. The taste is very strong and flavourful. A must for foie gras lovers :) I actually enjoyed this dish better without adding the jam on my slice of bread.  FOIE GRAS POUTINE (5/5) A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! The closer you are to Montreal, the better the poutine gets and this one is a 5-star poutine for sure! Large slices of foie gras and big chunks of cheese.. mm fatty good!  DUCK IN A CAN (5/5) So creative! It's a mini show when the waiter comes over and open the can in front of us (I recorded it all haha). The duck meat was tender and juicy - delicious. I would order this again the next time I visit Au Pied de Cochon."}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon was definitely a highlight of our trip to Montreal! My boyfriend and I and our two friends were lucky enough to snag four seats at the counter, so we had a great time watching the chefs work. Our waitress was wonderful and took the time to explain the different cocktails and dishes to us. I enjoyed a fantastic gin cocktail and my boyfriend and I shared the Plogue Ã  Champlain which was an amazing combination of sweet and savory. I ordered the pork chop for my meal and I was not disappointed in the least! My boyfriend overdid it and ordered one of the specials that was actually meant for two people, but it was still a delicious meal. My friend ordered a mackerel and lobster special and my other friend got the duck in a can, which was definitely a fun meal! Overall, an awesome night and definitely somewhere we'll go back to if we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing meal was had here. Great for big parties. We ordered everything with foie and I had one of the most memorable dishes ever! A whole pig head! The gelatinous and meaty nomz that kept me eating for hours. Everything was good except the poutine with foie think because I'm not a poutine fan. We had leftover to nosh on the next two night back at the hotel. Taaaaaaasty!!! Would love to go back again next time I'm in Montreal!"}

Mais c'est juste trop enorme, et trop gras. Mon conseil, partagÃ© tout.   Service et ambiance: les serveurs sont A1, rien a redire. Mais c'est trop petit, on est a l'etroit. Un local plus grand serait pas de trop!   Personnellement, je pense pas y retourner, y a ben trop de resto a montreal!"}
{"text":"We finally made it here.We saw the TV Show with them being featured. We came in the dead of winter,snow piled high. The place was packed. Got our seat, and ordered. We shared the duck in a can, which was amazingly good. Dinner equally good. We look forward to returning next time through. This is a unique establishment, I highly recommend going here for the experience."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal with some friends for the long weekend and I found this place beforehand. I was really looking forward to try the foie gras poutine. When I got there, the place was packed and the hostess told us that the entire night was booked and without reservations for that night and the next, it would be impossible to get a table. This was understandable since it was a very popular restaurant. However, what really bothered me t was the hostess's attitude. I then asked her if I can get the foie gras poutine to go. She almost rolled her eyes and stood there as if she couldn't believe that I didn't just give up and leave.  And as I was in the middle of ordering, she turned around without a word and left for 5 min. When she came back, I resumed my order. After my order, she immediately added that there will be no utensils with my order in a really snarky attitude. Wow, I am sorry to have inconvenienced you by ordering a 30 dollar dish to go and one for each person in a three people party without you even having to serve it. Guess you really don't appreciate business. Finally, as we were waiting outside, I decided to go in to let her know that we are waiting outside to the left of the entrance in case she can't find us. She immediately says, \"It's not ready yet!\" For a popular and upscale restaurant, having a hostess like that really gives it a bad reputation.   When we finally sat down to eat our poutine, the hostess's attitude already took half the joy out of it. The poutine itself tasted like normal poutine you get in Montreal with chunks of foie gras mixed in. The portion of foie gras was generous however I don't think it was worth the 20+ dollars extra compared to a normal poutine. Especially when it seemed to be just added in without having a sear or anything. I feel that the dish can be improved tremendously if a nice sear was given to the outside of the foie gras to add a next contrast of textures.   Overall, this restaurant is just okay. I would not go back for the food and the hostess's attitude was definitely a turn off."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for dinner on our first night I Montreal. Our only regret is that we did not make all of our dinner reservations here! Our meal was OUTSTANDING! Because we were torn over what to order our waiter took the time to determine our interests and helped us decide on two appetizers and two entrees. He made sure to mix in light options and in the end we decided on: the foie gras and boudin checked board and tuna Tatar as appetizers and the foie gras nigiri and duck in a can for our entrees. Each item was perfectly flavored and decadent. He spaced out our appetizers and entrees and everything tasted like a dream. When we changed our mind about not ordering dessert he brought us his favorite and persuaded us to come back the next day for purchases of maple syrup and Spanish olive oil. The food can only be paralleled by the service. We will most certainly be back here again on future trips."}
{"text":"Great experience, very rich food. For 2, we ordered the bluefin tuna tartare, apple and foie gras, and the duck in a can (2 apps, 1 main). It was all delicious, great flavour, and a lot of the food is sourced from their farm.   The menu is a bit simple, but our waitress was great with explaining how each dish was prepared, and was very friendly and attentive.   The cream base for the tartare was a bit strong for my liking, especially for the delicate and delicious tuna. Our favourite dish was the apple and foie gras - ham stuffed apple, seared foie gras and boudin (dark pig blood sausage), on a bed of picked cabbage and mashed potatoes. It was the perfect combination for the breezy end of summer meal with the apple and pork. The duck in a can was surprisingly moist, but very oily. Not sure if we would order it again because there wasn't a lot of variety of texture or flavour, but it was still tasty."}
{"text":"a 5 star food truck? Only in Montreal :) The Au Pied de Cochon food truck serves heart attack on wheels. It's the best and most delicious way to live if you ask me ;) Beigne Cochon - My partner downed this in 5 seconds. Succulent and juicy said he. Poutine Foie Gras - I have to be honest, watching this dish swimming in oil was a bit of a turn off. then i had more, and more, and more, and I cant eat anything else after it but I swear to god I cant stop thinking about it now. Floater- Strawberry Soda with Ice cream. Oh drool. So sweet so thick, so yummy Beigne Fraise - Ok this here, for me, is the piece de la resistance, This is Beigne filled with soda au fraise. Please hold me while I drool myself to sleep thinking of this beaut.  *Obviously don't go here if you don't like sweet, fattening delicious food. And yes, you are likely to get a heart attack or lose 5 years of your life. as long as I can eat those beigne fraise, I'm IN!"}
{"text":"Long story short: you will be fed to death for what will be the HEAVIEST meal in your life. Highly recommended for tourists like myself. The experience is incredible. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable. The vibe is ultra cool and you will probably get a lifetime's worth of foie gras in one meal."}
{"text":"Merveilleux! Ã tous les points de vue! Il faut y aller minimum une fois dans une vie! Le menu est extraordinaire, Ã©laborÃ© et une recherche dans les mariages des saveurs! DIVIN!!! Nous y retournerons pour le menu des pommes sans faute! FÃLICITATIONS Ã  toute cette magnifique Ã©quipe!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Open late. Always a good time!  Rich food!  You really can't go wrong!  Go there!"}
{"text":"For sure I left pregnant (I'm a guy).  This meal was awesome. Here's what I remember. (images at: http://paulsop.tumblr.com/post/129604832481/cabane-%C3%A0-sucre-au-pied-de-cochon-september-2016 )  - Spicy cantaloupe soup - Buttered bread with prosciutto  - Home made gnocchi and ricotta with lardons in a tasty soup base - Wood fired Pizza - Foie gras with poached pear - The meat dish was vast:   - Duck   - Chicken   - BBQ smoked Rib   - Bison tongue   - Blood sausage no blood?   - Pigs feet in honey   - Bone marrow   - Potatoes onions parsnip pickled radish beans  (I probably forgot something)  For desert I recall:   - Mini ice-cream cones   - Rhubarb pie   - Cute flower-pot tiramisu  + Lots of great drinks (we sat at the bar, and it was good interacting with the bar people)   This meal is AWESOME and CHEAP (for what you get).  We had left-overs (about 60% of the meat plate) that we ate for dinner.  They say (round about numbers, might be wrong as my brain is 'used') that 40,000 people try for 16,000 spots. Book for next season Dec 1st!  So sweet!"}
{"text":"I have yet to be disappointed by any of the dishes I have tried at this fine restaurant. Martin Picard knows his meats and loves to experiment with his foods in a way that is sure to delight your taste buds - provided you eat pork, duck and other game meats. Just be sure to call and reserve ahead of time."}
{"text":"One of my top 3 eats EVER, Martin Picard's Cabane Ã  sucre au PDC is amazing (and only 57$ per person for the meal!!!). Be ready to be seated in tight quarters with a lot of people you may not know - unless you're going with a very large group. Make sure your stomach is ready for a succulent 11-12, 4 course menu, but don't worry if you can't eat it all, the waiter will be pleased to provide you with as many take-home containers as needed!   **It should be noted that I sent in my reservation request on the morning that they opened online reservations and only heard back 3 months later. So if you're worried that you won't get in, there is hope yet!"}
{"text":"It's hard to miss this spot when in Montreal. My husband and I kicked off our mini moon at Au Pied with a 9pm ressie. You should make a res, they seat as right away.  Service was very polite and helpful - we ordered the house beer (good) and a Pinot noir like French wines. Everything is french, including the wines so I had to get used to some unfamiliar names. But we had great service and recommendations all the way.  We ordered the ham plate (plain) to start which has a yummy maple glaze atop, came with yummy french bread.  Definitely order this.   We moved onto the pig foot for a main - this was really good. It was fatty, and fried but meaty at the same time.  The base sauce for so much of French Canadian food is like a beefy, brown French onion soup - and that was kind of what this was like.  Came with hearty vegetables, and mashed potato.   We also had the famous duck in a can. I'm sorry to say but I didn't love this, I guess we also don't love foie gras and everything about the foie here is one big slab. It's Better I feel when simmered into a sauce. Anyway, while the cooking technique of sous vide duck breast with hearty vegetables and potato in a can is fun to watch and interested, can't say I loved the taste. The duck was rare though and done on point.  We had a side of duck fat fries which were just ok. Didn't taste much of the duck fat but hey fries were always good.   We were too full for dessert but looks like they do some good milkshake and ice cream. Definitely can't miss it when dining in Montreal, it's a staple. It wasn't our favorite as I overall felt the food was a bit one note but it's definitely a fun experience - they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"We recently stayed at Hotel Et Suites Le Dauphin in Quebec City, Quebec in Canada for 2 days. This was a beautiful hotel. The rooms were gorgeous with fridge, microwave, and individual computers. The breakfasts were great! There was everything you would want."}
{"text":"Oh Montreal... how to sum you up food wise. Eat as much as you can, purge so you can eat some more. If I could I would spend as much money as I could at this restaurant, Au Pied de Cochon. An incredibly famous eatery to those who are foodies, it is the devilish child of the ridiculously insane chef Martin Picard. This restaurant, like many others I have reviewed, can be summed up as a vegan nightmare. A menu completely in French and relatively unfriendly to vegetarians, if you are a carnivore looking for something more, come to this restaurant. Moreover, don't take a skinny girl here. Okay, that's a bit much but don't take a girl here who is expecting to \"eat light.\" That's the stupidest thing you can do. Located on a little street somewhere in the middle of Montreal off of St. Denis, this restaurant as my friend mentioned \"doesn't even need a sign.\" It is that popular. Rated as one of the best restaurants in a foodie city like Montreal, you better expect to see your respective religious deity when you bite into this food. So let's just say my standards were high. I mean, pole vaulting high.  Advice: reserve a table. If you're planning on going or just thinking about going reserve a table, now. The place doesn't seat many people and it has a notorious reputation for being a fantastic restaurant so, yes, reservations are heavily advised.   Off of the nitty gritty details and onto the food. If you want to read about this experience feel free. If you're looking for whether or not you should go? Yes. Just go. But be warned, you will spend a lot of money and then you will want to go back to spend more.   My friend and I started off with a veal bone marrow with caviar, served with a slice of bread in some sweet nectar of the gods. Now, I'm a fan of bone marrow and for those of you who are cringing at the thought of it. I shake my head at your sad sad life without the joys of trying the buttery, mouth-watering substance. It is, if cooked properly (and yes it was cooked beyond properly here) it is divine. The slice of bread it came with was toasted with what seemed to be honey and the caviar gave an amazing little bitterness but the bone marrow... I'm salivating just remembering it. The entire combination of the bone marrow, caviar, and sweet slice of bread was mind-bogglingly good; the epitome of artistic creation and the love of food in one entrÃ©e (appetizer if you're American). My friend and I scooped as much of the marrow out as we could, like @$*%ing vampires.  My main was, naturally, pork. With a title like Au Pied de Cochon, I had to try their \"cochon\" (pig for non-French speakers). I decided on their La Coupe, or cut of tenderloin. I don't know what it was exactly, but it was big, covered in an onion, mushroom, and (I think) red wine reduction and made me realize why food is one of life's initial pleasures. From what I understand, it is incredibly difficult to bake pork without it getting dry. I must admit, my pork was a bit drier than I would've preferred but hell, it was 0.5 kg of meat. That's over 1 lb of piggy pleasure. Now I'm not skinny, but I'm not enormous, I'm also 5'1 and I managed to eat the majority of my main. PRIMARILY because it was just so damn good. The one thing is, if you order this there is a 45 minute wait but in my opinion it is well worth it. Now my friend ordered the Foie Gras Hamburger (again, vegan nightmare), which was what I really wanted to try. Hesitantly, he let me try his rather expensive dish, and when I had it the foie gras melted. Despite being a near impossible burger to hold, it was fatty and delicious, and heart-stoppingly (in a good way) delectable.   In the end, when it came to dessert we couldn't fit another bite. I remember sitting there watching the cooks work, my friend (a chef) pointed out each task each person did. As an open kitchen you can see these men prepare your meal for you right there. As someone who has never been but has read about the food industry, this kitchen, the restaurant works like a restaurant should and serves food like most restaurants should. Despite the high quality of food, it doesn't have the snooty attitude that usually is associated with fine dining. The men in the kitchen are all tattooed, the waiters are in t-shirts. It looks like your average restaurant but it is so much more than that. If you are like me and enjoy the restaurant world and can appreciate it from the outside, I insist you come to Au Pied de Cochon. Watch the high octane but fluid movements of the cooks and take a piece of what you can out from your experience.   All in all, I will be going back, no doubt. From this essay of a review, Au Pied de Cochon is in a class of it's own with an atmosphere of its own. The food, though heavy, is amazing. If people knew about the chef who started this restaurant, they would understand the menu better. In essence, M. Picard is saying \"Go big or Go Home.\" Go. It is worth the money you'll spend."}
{"text":"I think it's a bit overhyped...but then again, we're not usually fans of super fatty/super oily dishes. The flavors were just overwhelming...the duck in a can was a great photo op, but more than half the can was just duck fat, which we don't eat for personal health reasons. The poutine was super fried and I'm not sure why they brought it out as an appetizer instead? So it was cold and mushy by the time the rest of the entrees arrived. We also ordered the special black truffle bone marrow at an additional cost except we didn't really taste any truffle at alll....hmmm. French onion soup was overpowered by the cheese. For four people...we ordered a couple appetizers and two entrees to share and that was more than enough. Service was good, cramped seating area on the side of the bar though. Overall, just okay. Check it out if you can get a reservation, but if not, you're not really missing out on too much."}
{"text":"Well of all that talk about 5 star of this restaurant. I will have to say it's only worth 3 star for the food but a 4 star for the service and atmosphere.  14 of us eating here and I have tried 4 of there dish. The couple duck dish include in the can is not bad but got cold quickly before I finished it. My friend pigs feet was worse because I only had a couple piece and felt full because it was too fattening. The foie gras wasn't good at all compare to some of other restaurant I tried.  So is it a 5 star? No, definitely not! I would not understand so many people rate this so high???!!!!"}
{"text":"From service to food, this spot is a 5.  We went in with high expectations and were not disappointed. We both ordered the specials, one a pork shank and one a meatloaf mix of veal and beef(I think). My dish was a little salty but honesty it was SO good, I didn't care. We also had 2 desserts, one sugar pie with maple ice cream and 1 milkshake with these sugar croutons inside. WOW. Go here now!"}
{"text":"PDC was the restaurant that I was most looking foward to going to on my visit to Montreal and the one I was slightly let down on. My big concern was what the hell i was going to eat...everything on the menu looked so damn good and I know the portions are very rich and heavy- so..(cue Shatner) WHAT...DOES...ONE...DOOOO?!  I decided on two apps and an entree...app one was braised tripe with bacon, egg, and smoked paprika. The tripe melted in my mouth...so good...this would make a great hangover breakfast. Next I had the duck carpaccio with spicy aioli..a new one for me...never saw duck carpaccio anywhere before. Again, very good dish ...two for two so far..alright, feelin' good. Then my entree- pastry tart with blood sausage and foie...how can that not be awesome? Well..it wasnt. There was an over-abundance of carmelized onions and vinegar in this dish that ruined it for me..totally overwhelmed the other flavors..even the foie. It was damn big though..and at this point, i was done..full..didnt even get dessert.  The service was of the 'take your order, heres the food, heres the check, get out\" variety..hence the 3 stars overall."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place! A touch over rated!"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience.  We called in the same day because I saw the reviews on this site and thought I had to try.  The girl told me on the phone maybe she could get me in if we showed up a bit later that evening but that people usually book a week in advance. So we get there, wait about 45 minutes for a table (despite the fact that there were 2 or 3 empty tables all along).  The waiter (who I suspected was also the owner) rushed me and pressured me to order.  The treatment was like we were privileged to have the time of day in their restaurant.  I wanted to know what the menu items that I was ordering were but the waiter wasn't too interested in explaining anything at all.  So we hastily and under bad advice choice an onion soup, a blood sausge pie and a pig's foot.  The onion soup was quite tasty at the beginning but when we were close to finished, we noticed the chunks of animal fat at the bottom which for me really quite disgusted me.  Then came the pig foot and the blood sausage pie - I guess I should have known better than to order a blood sausage pie because it was absolutely an abomination. The foot was an experiment just to see and we were not pleased with the result.  Apart from the fact that the majority of the menu items are nasty cuts of meat, the food was not well balanced at all and extremely fatty and salty.   Just thinking about this place makes me want to gag.   We didn't eat most of the food but the restaurant had no problem charging us. I really don't understand why this place is so popular."}
{"text":"A few words, outstanding, impeccable, decadent, gluttonous, succulence, shame and short term regret are just a few of the feelings and thoughts that will ebb and flow while dining at Au Pied de Cochon.  The vibe is non pretentious, the staff is friendly, very knowledgeable and the food is remarkable.  A few things to note APC is not for those who are health conscious or pretending to be on a diet.  Food this complex and rich will cause your system to go into a tailspin/shock so be forewarned your heart rate and blood pressure might take a turn for the worse.  Let's not forget the incredible seafood offerings that range from the budget minded to the Neptune of gluttony.  For a person who generally avoids pork and generally Foie Gras related contents this was an amazing culinary experience.  I broke the rules and really enjoyed the below feast. Foie Gras Cromesquis - Wow  Tomato Tartlet - Wow Tarragon Bison Tongue - Wow.  Never say never Foie Gras 'Tout Nu' - Wow  Terrine -Wow PDC's Cut - 500 Grams of Pork Loin I mean come on man?  Wait are you going to take all of this to the face? Duck Margret in Mushroom Sauce -A good choice and solid selection of thinly sliced duck breast. Duck in a Can - This should not be missed highly impressed with the content and presentation.  A must for all first time visitors. Fries (in duck fat) - These were awesome too bad I was running out of steam. PDC's Mashed Potatoes - Cheese curds blended with handmade mashed potatoes  Pied de Cochon - Beer and we had plenty."}

{"text":"If you want to enjoy this place you can't be concerned about your waistline or your cholesterol level.  All of the dishes are full of flavor and fat.  It would be nice if they had some dishes that weren't so heavy so that you could leave without feeling you need to climb up Mount Royal to burn off the calories.  The best dish I had was the Crispy PDC Salad."}
{"text":"Un restaurant sÃ»r-primÃ© Ã  mon avis. Oui un festin pour les amateurs de foie gras. Cependant, notre table se situait prÃ¨s de la porte de l'immense cave Ã  vin provoquait des problÃ¨mes de chaleur et de froideur constant.

{"text":"After four or five visits I summarize that PDC is a five star experience with 4 star food. Everything is mostly super not superb , but, you are going to have the quintessential foodie experience here.   M. Picard has put it all together in this Montreal must go place. The elements of greatness are:  an unusual and super creative menu.cool and casual atmosphere and an extremely high level of service. If you are reading this you probably already know about the ultra \"rich\" food. Most of the menu items involved some unique amalgam of pork, fois gras - hello California come to Montreal -and duck. If you want you can even eat healthy with nice roasted sea foods and salads. During the summer months there is also a fresh seafood \"bar\" offering  extravagant selections. Our most recent choices for our a table of six were mostly the standard PDC items with the Pig's foot swimming in gravy just OK, the duck magret very good and the standout this time the Ploque a Champlain, a crepe like pork and fois gras combination.  PDC is a foodie mecca and is most always crowded with a well healed clientele ready to drop a few hundred bucks if need be to experience this place. On a hot summer night this past June the place was still rock'n after 11pm and we saw a few celebs at a nearby table. The staff were apologetically late with our table, we had to wait almost 45 minutes after the reserved time to be seated, but they made up for the inconvenience by leading a few of our party to the bar and providing some nice wine and an appetizer plate gratis. Very classy and unexpected.  The servers were friendly,extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu, and were of the highest calibre which adds so much to the overall experience. The wine offerings were extensive and expensive, but, we managed to find some nice bottles in the mid $40 range and our party managed to knock off four or five bottles.  So for all you Yelpaholic restaurant ,mavens, officiandos,doyens like me,this is the kind of place that we live for !"}
{"text":"Have been here several times and it is always a special experience- very popular and so always jammed, but one is treated by the wait staff as special- for goodness sake go slowly- servings are large and the food rich and filling- order and eat as though you intend to return, as you should."}
{"text":"When I asked a buncha friends where to go in Montreal, several of them immediately recommended Au Pied de Cochon as the \"best meal of my life\" but with the add on of \"...if you can get reservations.\"   Well, I remembered to go there but immediately forgot about the whole reservation part. However, that didn't stop us from showing up anyhow just to check if maybe we could slide by. Success!! We managed to snag the (apparently) elusive walk-in spot and were elated.   The restaurant itself is bright and pretty, and the staff were super friendly and chatty. After a fantastic sparkling rosÃ© suggestion from our server I was pretty much sold, we were feeling so good about getting in on a lark that there was basically no way this could have been a bad experience.   We ordered the foie gras poutine (hey, I've never had it and we're in Montreal), dumplings with shrimp, pork and foie gras which were wrapped in squid ink and beet noodles and served with 'dragon sauce' and maple syrup (a real stand out!), and the duck in a can which also had foie gras. (So basically what I'm saying is several geese died for this meal.) Everything was very tasty- a totally satisfying and fun meal- though I can't say it was life changing by any means... it certainly seemed to be more of a seafood place so perhaps had we ordered the more expensive seafood-y stuff it woulda been life changing. Or maybe if I was a bigger fan of foie gras? (Like, it's fine but it doesn't make me do backflips.) But I'm pretty satisfied with it as just a good ol' fashioned stand out meal.   We also ordered the maple crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e because Canada- also a lovely choice.   All in all, I think I would have been a little more disappointed had I waited months to get this reservation, but as a walk in it was positively delightful. (Maybe that's in part the bragging rights sweetening the deal.)"}
{"text":"We all went back and forth many times on whether APDC should get three or four stars.   I thought we were off to a good start when I was able to make reservations and confirm via email, vs over the phone as their website says. I checked in early with the hostess, and she told me that they were clearing up tables in the back, and within 5 to 10 minutes would get us in. 45 minutes later, many people empty from their tables, and a few people that came after us were seated before us! I was outraged.  Outrage redux when people seated after us were then attended to and served before us. I believe because we're younger patrons, they figured we wouldn't be cash cows like the monied yuppies or older men could be.  Inside, the restaurant has no decor or theme to speak of. There's only ONE bathroom for the entire restaurant, awkwardly set behind the bar area so that you have to maneuver past the bins and staff. I did give them one extra star in my book for playing Montreal music such as Leonard Cohen (!!) and Arcade Fire.   We started with the foie gras cromequis, which really were surprising but pleasant explosions in your mouth. The foie gras tart followed: a nice melted circle of cheese and foie gras on a buttery pastry. We were all waiting for the foie gras poutine, and we all chose it as our favorite. The mix of melted foie and the usual gravy was sinful. Our final dish was the PDC melting pot, and it was a more disappointing note to end on: with sub-par blood sausage and what was sadly too much like a hot dog.  Make sure you share everything: it sounds as though we ordered very little for four, but any more than the amount we got and we would have passed out at the table from the richness. My friend actually described her state as \"food drunk\". I'm glad we went at least once to see what all of the hype was about. Even if it didn't quite live up to it as the best meal of my life, it's up there."}
{"text":"Good, but not great foie gras (great foie gras does not need to be drowned in a  balsamic or any other glaze!). The duck in a can works and the foie packed with it works better there too; the pot of assorted meats got good marks as well. An Italiante eggplant and pasta starter didn't work and shouldn't have been served, and the beef tongue was good without being particularly distinguished for those who grew-up with and enjoy tongue. We understand that the deafening noise level is part of the experience--although we don't appreciate it, but the real let-down was the service, or lack thereof. Despite having an early reservation and ordering without delay, staff kept wandering by without either noticing or at least responding to empty glasses (yes, we did want to order another round!). Oh, and to the server who promised to wrap-up the last of the meat pot to go--yes, we finally gave up and went; not planning to return."}
{"text":"Table rÃ©servÃ©, nous n'avions pas trop mangÃ© le midi et on a bien fait.  DÃ©jÃ  n'ayez pas peu d'y aller si la carte de base ne vous tente pas trop car il y a ENORMEMENT de plats ajoutÃ©s suivant les arrivages de saison. Et la je dis costaud car on peut vraiment tomber sur des petites perles. N'ayez pas non plus peur de manger que des plats Ã  base de viande car vous pouvez tomber sur des arrivages de crustacÃ©s de qualitÃ©s supÃ©rieurs.  Par rapport Ã  ces 2 points je suis assez bluffÃ© de la diversitÃ©s des plats proposÃ©s qui ne se limite donc pas seulement Ã  la carte de leur site web.  Concernant les plats c'Ã©tait vraiment bon : - tarte au boudin avec foie gras : super gout, excellent et toute la tablÃ©e a adorÃ©. - homard entier : trÃ¨s bon mais je suis un peu dÃ©Ã§u de la sauce mise dans le plat qui a donc changÃ© un peu le gout e donc alourdi le plat. je prÃ©fÃ¨re le manger nature et mettre de la sauce SI j'ai envie pour un ou deux morceaux ... - jarret de veau : alors lÃ  trÃ¨s haut niveau de qualitÃ© ... !!! Il s'agissait d'un arrivage et vraiment rien Ã  regretter malgrÃ© le prix de la piÃ¨ce ^^ par contre quand la serveuse dis que c'est pour 2 faut arrÃªter, c'est plutÃ´t pour 4 oui !!!!! Viande excellente et cuite parfaitement, l'assaisonnement rien Ã  redire. Bravo le cuistot ! Vraiment super plat, mon prÃ©fÃ©rÃ© du repas :)  Nous n'avons pas pris de dessert car de toute maniÃ¨re nous n'avons pas finis et donc nous avons ramenÃ© le reste Ã  la maison.  Le service Ã©tait bien, bravo Ã  la serveuse qui a su nous relister les nombreux plats du jour ^^  Je le conseille mais je ne pense pas non plus y retourner souvent car c'est quand mÃªme consÃ©quent et en plus ca reprÃ©sente un certain budget tout de mÃªme. A faire avec des amateurs de grosses bouffes et qui n'ont pas pur de manger dense :)  Je suis content de mon expÃ©rience et je salue le bon travail du restaurant sur tous les points que l'on attend de ce genre de service !"}
{"text":"this was my culinary highlight of our little girl's trip to Montreal but let's rewind 2 months; i heard it's insanely hard to get reservations here and after marking it on my calendar, i made sure to contact APC right when they opened their books prior to 2 months. it was relatively easy and the email reservation was simple :)  we went for our a bachelorette dinner and honestly... leave your fancy clothes at home! we were so overdressed but with plenty of people celebrating various occasions we thought it'd be ok but sadly no need for dinner jackets or heels here.  we spotted at least 2 bachelor parties and 1 birthday party, just in our vicinity so it's quite special.  the restaurant is located in a cute portion of avenue duluth and if you're not looking for it, you may miss it. we had a 8pm reservation but didn't get seated until 8:30pm; not bad.  the restaurant is long and narrow and almost shaped like a backwards \"C\" if that makes sense.  not circular but with the kitchen and bar located in a pretty central location- it's not a place where you can expect to see the people sitting in the back of the place.   we got all shared dishes for the 6 of us and sadly we didn't even finish it!  we started off with the foie gras croquette- eat in one bite. savor the oozing morsel of goodness. probably the BEST thing.   we then moved onto sharing two onion soups.  the stock was hearty and onions were plentiful.  i'm glad we shared because i would have not had space to eat more.  we also ordered the dumplings and i wish the server explained why dumpling skin colors were different but the 2 sauces to drizzle that accompanied it was good- just wish we knew what it was.  we got the special poutine but i honestly thought the poutine at valentin's (the chain) was better. ha! it was with duck fat fries but trying to make a non-fancy thing fancier...hmm, probably would not order again.  duck in can- with veggies/ duck/ and a slab of foie... it's preserved, opened table-side, and poured over some bread.  it's rich so be ready to be foie gras-ed out. really delicious but if you don't like duck or foie, you shouldn't be here.  big eye tuna - why get fish at a place called \"feet of a pig\"?  because it shows just how good the establishment is with being so versatile.  at first, i was surprised our server would recommend it as a special but as they were OUT of the pork chop and head of the pig, i guess there's not many other large format meals to recommend. the tuna was almost like a steak and quite tasty.  we got the beef tartare because they were out of veal and bison but it almost went untouched as it came out so late.    we ended the meal with a maple cream brulee and i felt like i was eating maple flavored butter. not that maple flavored butter is a bad thing but after a heavy meal, we were hoping for some sorbet or fresh berries or something.  minus a star because service was lackluster.  i'm sure with it being so busy server's attention could be wayward however we hardly saw our server and he just seemed so quick to get us out. can't be helped, it's a busy place!"}
{"text":"Worth the hype and a must try when visiting Montreal.  Delicious food and efficient/friendly service.  Cool neighborhood not obvious to travelers too."}
{"text":"I went back this holiday, my husband says it will be a holiday tradition, this time we ordered an entire pig head, it was epic, my husband was in meat haven. And I forgot how amazing the pecan pie is, best pecan pie ever! Even after having an insanely heavy meal, I couldn't stop eating the pie. I think we needed to be rolled out to our car."}
{"text":"This was definitely a high light of my trip to Montreal.  You must try the duck carpaccio, I'm pretty sure it was the best thing I have ever eaten in my entire life!  I seriously have dreams about it.  The foie gras is also delicious and the duck in a can is good and also a really fun dish to order."}
{"text":"Rich. Rich. Rich.  Three words that describe this meal, who can afford this meal, and what I think about the fanfare about this place.  I'll start off with the nice things. The foie poutine was good, sure. But it was overpriced and the flavors were muddled.  The rest of the meal? Again, good. But I think that the meatloaf had muddled flavors, being overly reliant on the richness of the foie. But YMMV.  The food really deserves four stars, despite being disappointed. I really appreciate the concept behind the meal and the idea of utilizing the entire animal. It's the service that knocked it to three, as everyone was curt, and our server was arrogant.  Again, this place is well reviewed and worth a visit, if not solely due to its iconic status. But be prepared for a ton of foie gras and lower your expectations for service, and you may come out a happier customer than I.  Oh and the bread and butter was fantastic."}
{"text":"Exorbitant in every way-- rich foods, plates piled high, cream sauces, more foie gras than I've ever seen, with a price tag to match - up charges and tacked on items you never asked for.  It's an eating and gorging event while seated at German style picnic tables shoulder to shoulder with your fellow diners.  Believe me, I do get it.  I love my duck fat, I make my own maple syrup.  I can eat, rest and eat some more.   But the summer camp atmosphere -- perhaps it's not for everyone..."}
{"text":"While in Montreal, I made it a priority to try out some high-quality, authentic local food.  It was tricky to get a reservation here, and my fiancÃ© and I ended up with a slot at 10 PM on a Sunday.  We arrived about a half hour early and were seated immediately, but the place was hopping, and it was still super busy by the time we left around 11 PM!  It had a fun and nicely-decorated, but not too pretentious, atmosphere.  I'm torn here between 3 and 4 stars.  We ordered the poutine (and some drinks) to start off with, and it was definitely tasty.  I then decided to get the foie gras nigiris as my entrÃ©e, even though they were listed with the appetizers and therefore came out pretty quickly.  Such an amazing, delicious dish!  Our experience declined a bit after this--my fiancÃ© ordered the chicken, and we waited about 45 additional minutes for this to come out, with no acknowledgement from the wait staff.  (Otherwise, the service was pretty good--the staff members were kind, and they were prompt in bringing out silverware, refilling our drinks, etc.)  When the chicken did come, he said that it was decent but nothing amazing.  TL;DR: Excellent foie gras nigiris, lively atmosphere, but the service could have been better.  I would be willing to give this place another try but wasn't blown away, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Hail all things pork and foie gras!!!  Love this place and try to get a seat every time i come to Montreal.  If i had one knock, it would be the difficulty in getting a table, but that speaks more to how good it really is."}
{"text":"I've decided that every time I am in Montreal, I must eat here. Why? Because the poutine with foie gras is amazing. Nice big chunks of foie gras, with delicious fries (the fries themselves are cooked in duck fat - bomb), and cheese. So so so so so good.   I had the duck in a can and that was great as well. And it had a huge slab of foie gras in it.  If you like foie gras, this place is heaven. If you are a duck, this place is hell."}
{"text":"We went to dinner at PDC on a Saturday night. We had seats at the bar which was perfect given a superb bartender / waiter and getting to see the hustle and bustle of a very involved staff. Our server was extremely helpful in recommending dishes and highly recommended the veal shank for two and the crab and cucumber salad. First - the salad was super fresh and the crab ultra tender and flavorful. The veal shank was gigantic. It came served on a huge platter with polenta, red wine Demi glaze sauce fois gras sauce and these awesome pin wheel vegetables. The shank was braised and fall of the bone tender and juicy. Amazing meat. We couldn't finish but were highly satisfied although my wife thought while perfectly prepared the meat was a little bland. The bread we got in the beginning of the meal was also great. Served hot it was crusty and soft with yeasty slightly salty goodness. For desert we had the pecan pie with vanilla ice cream which I looved. It was flaky and the pecans crisp and gooey at the same time and the ice cream proved the perfect compliment. It would have better if it was served warm but not a huge deal. We had wonderful glasses of red wine through he evening. I'd highly recommend PDC to anyone on a trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Rustic, expensive Montreal eatery reputed to be among the best the city has to offer. The name means \"pig's foot\" and that is actually what we ordered. That and the poutine with foie gras (as an appetizer) and the duck in a can, which really is a duck in a can, boiled for 27 minutes and then dumped onto your place. It also has foie gras. Foie gras is everywhere in Montreal! This is rich, heavy, French food with a Quebecois accent, will leave you feeling extremely full, practically to the point of hallucination, and will make you shit out the entire population of Canada in the morning. So don't order too much.  Unmarked door. Double-check the address before heading out. Reservations essential."}
{"text":"Cabane Ã  Sucre Au Pied de Cochon is an experience that you should have at least once in your life. If you manage to book a reservation or have a friend who scores a table and invites you, here is what to expect...  For approximately 72$ per person not including drinks, you will have a dinner themed around maple syrup (winter) or apple cider (fall).  You will be seated at a table designed to accommodate 8-14 people. The place is like a rustic beer hall.  There are cocktails created to match the season. These are creative and a great way to start the meal.  The meal consists of about 5 starters, 4-5 main meat dishes, and 4-5 desserts. In two visits I have found that most dishes are very good, one or two will really wow, and one or two will be either too salty (main meats sometimes) or a bit uninteresting.  Everything is served for the whole table and comes out in waves. There can be odd timing delays in service, yet the staff are usually amazing.  Definitely a worthwhile experience. More of a feast with a bit of fancy (such as highlighting Japanese influence this winter) than a fancy meal. You will leave full."}
{"text":"Alright - the only reason why I visited this joint was because the awesome segment Bourdain did on the restaurant.  This place caters to the glutton and I most certainly am one.  And hey, I just love absurd excess.  This is 'Watch The Throne' in restaurant form -- Audemars, Maybachs, Margiela and au Pied de Cochon.  And I was prepared for this dinner - my tablemate is a nurse so that should increase my survivability in case of the likely heart attack.  This joint is Epic Meal Time... in a fancy wrapper.  Being my only visit, I went for the marquee items -- the foie gras poutine and the duck-in-a-can.  And in case it wasn't clear -- this place is not for vegetarians (which my dining partner was) -- so we also ordered the only non-meat items on the menu: beet & goat cheese salad, tomato tarlet, and... yea... that was it.  The foie gras poutine was sublime.  And it's not a case of just dumping crazy-ass expensive foie gras on some fries and calling it a day.  Duck fat fries and some impossibly rich and smooth gravy are what really makes this poutine stand out.  Bar none - best poutine I've ever had.  Must order.  The duck-in-a-can (1/2 duck, 100g of foie gras, balsamic demi glaze, buttered cabbage, 1/2 roasted garlic and thyme) is gimmicky as hell with a slick table presentation (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcwegqzsXoM).  The duck was moist and again - rich and decadent beyond belief.  But honestly, I was hitting the wall after downing the poutine.  Even for a fat bastard like me - the fat and salt intake was starting to overwhelm me.  I didn't get a heart attack - but I could sense the on set of gout.  The tomato tartlet and beet & goat cheese salad were pretty solid from what I sampled, but to be honest - I felt bad devouring down sinfully rich and delicious dead animals while my tablemate watched on tried to enjoy the salads.  My shit-eating grin from ear-to-ear and my eyes rolling back probably reinforced the fact: \"You don't make friends with salad\".  Finally, the creme brulee is burned high so it's really charred - they did warn us about this beforehand but heed the warning as it's not to everyone's taste.  Service was flawless even though they did tease us with some of the specials: \"[Naming off something that sounds light and vegetarian]... which we then stuff with bacon/foie gras/duck.\"  And the washrooms are trippy - the little TVs showing slightly off-putting scenes of woodland hunting.  Hate to do it, but it falls just short of 5-stars for me due to lack of vegetarian options.  I know, I know - this is not the point of the restaurant at all.  But come on, this is the first time I've gone to a high-end restaurant that didn't at least *try* to offer some decent non-carnivore entrees.  Some balance to the fat and salt-heavy items won't have hurt at all.  But overall - a great dining experience and I would recommend rolling in heavy with a deep group of carnivores to chop up the pig's head and stuffed pig's leg with foie gras (which looked amazing on the other tables).  I would heavily recommend predialling \"91\" on your phone to save yourself those precious milliseconds for the inevitable cardiac arrest."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, homemade and delicious ( but extremely rich)  The Foie gras poutine is a master piece. The duck in a can is excellent.  Whenever in montreal this is a great restaurant to go to.  Too bad I went there in 2006, and I dont remember all the other items tried. I have to go back."}
{"text":"Punch by punch review.  Reservations made over a month ago for 8pm, 8h42 we are not in the door yet, the table is not ready, it does not start well...  Server does not know the prices on the specials... \"Its 25 or 28 or 30$\".  Menu is not descriptive so asked the waiter to order is own favorites. Haren as an appetizer, can of duck for the main course. Lets see if he knows his food.  They also have their own wine imports so I told my preferences to the waiter so he can pick me a bottle... I'm putting alot of faith in this waiter...  Good pick from the waiter on the wine, syrah, copain from california.  Appetizer was ordinary, I should have asked more questions... Not a big fan of fish with skin on it...  The canned duck was decadent, decadent. Just too much. Insane amounts of foie gras. Not used to eating so rich... I'm gonna faint.  Conclusion: I've had the pied de cochon experience, its done, it was good, not coming back.  Its an experience to have but its too loud, seating is too tight, food is too rich, now going to bed."}
{"text":"Cabane a sucre PDC is not like any sugar shack you've ever visited, I guarantee it! The venue is nothing special; it's just like any other sugar shack with traditional long wooden tables and a few stuffed coyotes hanging from the large overhead beams, and a section where you can buy some canned goods and even clothing with the PDC logo. HOWEVER, the vibe, the food, the drinks, the FOOD (did I mention that already?) is what makes this sugar shack infamous!   The vibe is electrifying; you wait in line till your name is called to be seated and seeing how long you've already waited since you made your reservation, the anticipation is high!. You are seated, offered one of the seasonal cocktails (usually classics with a twist of maple), and then the feast begins! During this last visit for apple season, the theme was Italian, so we were served a variety of entrees, mains and desserts reminiscent of classic Italian dishes on generous portions.  I say reminiscent cause this isn't your Nona's traditional lasagna dish. We enjoyed an antipasti of parmesan fondue, then entrees of bolognese and foie gras passatelli soup, ciambella salata, homemade burrata cheese with seasonal fruits. Then came the butternut squash gnocchi, eggplants a la parmigiana, timpano lasagna, braised tripe ragout, beef tournedos brochettes wrapped in bacon, and stuffed green peppers. As if that wasn't enough, make room for dessert! Strawberry tart, sfogliatelle with caramelised apples, and an ice cream cake. The thing about this menu is that besides the flavorful and creative use of ingredients, the presentation is what makes this meal memorable.   Martin Picard has been at it for years, and with two different menus per season, I am always amazed at the creative inspiration behind his plates. In comparison to the previous season, this menu wasn't as exotic maybe as the Asian theme or as generous in terms of portions, but don't get me wrong, we ate well and we took leftovers home! Everyone should at least get to this foodie experience once for themselves and for those like me, who enjoy the fresh air, the festive environment and the creative dishes offered at this sugar shack, I am already looking forward to next season!"}
{"text":"On va se l'dire et se l'redire, le Pied de Cochon est un must Ã  notre \"To Do list\"! Je m'y suis retrouvÃ© avec mon amoureux pour un souper gourmand en tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte et nous avons bien apprÃ©ciÃ© notre repas!  En entrÃ©e, nous avons partagÃ© le tataki de cerf et les bÃ¢tonnets de fromage. Pour Ãªtre franche, les bÃ¢tonnets Ã©taient juste \"ok\" et nous avons regrettÃ© ne pas prendre une entrÃ©e de tataki chaque. C'Ã©tait juste trop bon. Umami! Comme plat principal notre choix c'est arrÃªtÃ© sur le classique \"Canard en canne\" qui Ã©tait trÃ¨s copieux et bien satisfaisant pour nos papilles! Par gourmandise, nous avons en plus prit la cÃ´te de cerf qui, n'Ã©tait pas mon plat prÃ©fÃ©rÃ© mais sans contredit, Ã  essayer!   Pour dessert... MY GOD!! La meilleure tarte au pacanes DU MONDE!!!! Oh my, j'ai payÃ© 13$ Mais je repaierais facilement le double et le triple! Meilleure que celle de Grand-maman, mais si vous lui parlez, dÃ®tes-lui que c'est la sienne la meilleure!

{"text":"Il y a un mois et demi quand nous sommes venus entre Yelpeurs, j'Ã©tais prÃªte Ã  donner trois Ã©toiles mais aprÃ¨s mon expÃ©rience de ce soir, j'augmente Ã  quatre Ã©toiles. Je m'explique.  ThÃ¨me: Marocain   Le premier service, le gÃ¢teau de foie gras. Beau moyen d'impressionner la galerie. Les deux fois, ont Ã©tÃ© une expÃ©rience incroyable. Le mÃ©lange de saveurs sucrÃ©es, acides et salÃ©es, c'est la dÃ©cadence dans toute sa splendeur. Ensuite sont servis en mÃªme temps la tajine de boulettes de saumons avec petits pois et avocats, les calmars bouillis et farcis avec du porc un peu Ã©picÃ© et une leur version de porchetta avec une petite salade et des oreilles de christ soufflÃ©es. Bon, mais sans plus. Ensuite vient l'omelette. Ã ma premiÃ¨re visite celle-ci Ã©tait servie dans un vol-au-vent vent Ã  l'encre de sÃ¨che avec des aubergines et une bÃ©chamel blanche et une bÃ©chamel Ã  l'encre de sÃ¨che. J'ai personnellement vraiment pas aimÃ©. Cette fois ci, ce plat avait Ã©tÃ© remplacÃ© par une omelette bien soufflÃ©e avec un gros tas de bon bacon caramÃ©lisÃ© Ã  l'Ã©rable. Grosse grosse amÃ©lioration. Tout le monde a adorÃ©. Ensuite sont venu les tanjia. Une sucrÃ©e et une salÃ©e. La sucrÃ©e, c'Ã©tait une rÃ©ussite les deux fois. La salÃ©e Ã©tait 100 fois meilleure cette fois-ci comme ils ont ajoutÃ© du citron. Pour accompagner la viande, avant, ils donnaient un genre de cake de carottes avec les fÃ¨ves blanches Ã  l'intÃ©rieur et personne Ã  aimÃ©. On voulait mÃªme pas en rapporter dans nos doggy bags. Ils ont remplacÃ© ce plat par une genre de bouillie bien Ã©picÃ©e de fÃ¨ves blanches avec des carottes caramÃ©lisÃ©es dans le sirop d'Ã©rable. Mega upgrade, jai adorÃ©. Tout Ã§a servi avec une bonne miche de pain maison.  Les desserts, quantitÃ© industrielle de desserts, soit la tire dÃ©licieuses dans un banc de granitÃ© Ã  la menthe. Pour moi, c'est ce dessert qui l'emporte. Aussi, des crÃªpes aux mandarines flambÃ©es au Cointreau, une crÃ¨me glacÃ©e sur un genre de gÃ¢teau au dates (je crois), de l'Ã©corce avec crÃ¨me et chocolat blanc et deux diffÃ©rentes pÃ¢tes d'amandes, une frite et l'autre au sucre Ã  la crÃ¨me.   \"Â PropsÂ \" Ã  eux qui ont fait un petit dessert sans lactose pour mon amie intolÃ©rante.  Donc, en gros, j'ai bien apprÃ©ciÃ© mon expÃ©rience, j'aime beaucoup le fait qu'ils se soient amÃ©liorÃ©s dans les plats et contente d'avoir rencontrÃ© Martin Picard ;)"}
{"text":"The most disappointing part of going to Au Pied de Cochon for lunch? Not being able to try the 15 different things I wanted to order.  There is nothing \"light\" about anything on the menu here, and that's the way it should be.   Everything we ordered was rich and decadent, from the terrine to the \"sugar pie\", and the foie in between, everything was delicious. Hope to be back in Montreal soon, just to get to have a few more meals here."}
{"text":"Holy god.  Waited half an hour with our reservation. Annoying that we had to stand in the tiny hallway up against a whole lot of strangers and people trying to get in and out of the restaurant.  After that - Duck in a Can! Foie Gras on Poutine! Pot o' Meat!  DAMN good. So rich. So delicious.  SO MUCH FOOD!  Presentation was an awesome experience.  I ate one dinner in Montreal and was so glad it was this one?"}
{"text":"We had a romantic dinner at Au Pied de Cochon. We showed up early on a weekday night for our reservation and had to pretty much wait until our reservation time. One hostess was a little un-approachable, the other one was quite friendly though quiet. Our waiter was excellent. I ordered an appetizer of french onion soup which had a fantastic layer of cheese on top with a good base of soup as well underneath. For my main course, I had a duck dish that was delicious - similar to a steak served with a mushroom and onion sauce and my wife had a pork chop in a similar sauce. Both entrees were fantastic. Dessert we had creme brulee which was great - perfectly crisped and warm on top while still being cold, sweet  and creamy on the bottom.   The only major thing that prevents Au Pied de Cochon from being a 5 star place in my opinion is the soap in the bathrooms - it was fairly dingy bar soap. Maybe this is a common thing outside of the U.S. (but I didn't notice it anywhere else) and these are the same restrooms that the cooks use so that was a turn off for me."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants, but I have only been able to eat at it twice in the last 2 years because I live in the USA. The last time I tried I didn't have a reservation and was turned away because they are always packed. Lock up a reservation a month in advance online. This weekend I had:  Temaki Tartare Fois Gras Nigiri Fois Gras Poutine This cod pastry, which I forgot the name of Cucumber/lime cocktail ($12) Cucumber/lime mocktail ($3.75)  All this was $126 USD with tax and a 20% tip included. Damn I love that exchange rate!  Everything was delicious like usual. The Foie Gras poutine was a little skimpy on the Foie Gras compared to the last time I had it though. Service is great. The bathroom has a Japanese toilet. I'm not really sure what the point of that is but its interesting."}
{"text":"After all the rave reviews about this place that I read, I found it thoroughly disappointing. The service was fine, but the restaurant itself was noisy and crowded. I had a foie gras appetizer and the bison tartare, but neither was anything special and the tartare was too heavy on capers. The food was expensive and just wasn't the good. After all the hype and waiting until 9pm just to get a table, I was expecting a dining experience and instead got just a meal."}
{"text":"Hmmmm...what can I say about this place?   Well, I will start of with the positives: the food, of course. The majority of the menu items are incredibly rich and the portion sizes are pretty big, so be careful when ordering. If you like foie gras and dishes like poutine and boudin (blood sausage) then you must try this restaurant. Even if those things are not too your liking, there are several lighter items on the menu. In fact, the tomato tart and marinated herring appetizers were our favorites of the night. Other items we ordered included the happy pork chops, boudin tart, PDC mashed potatoes.  The happy pork chops were two ginormous pork chops. Nothing special or terrible, but compared to the appetizers we ordered, it seemed kind of plain. The boudin tart had the same flakey crust as the tomato tart, but again the serving size is HUGE, so along with the richness of the sausage, it almost became a chore to eat this. The PDC mashed potatoes are just mashed potatoes with lots of cream, butter, and garlic.   All the negatives had to do with the service and dÃ©cor. The hostess that particular evening was having a bad day I think, she was very brusque. Showing up on time and letting her know of our 9:30 reservation, she gives me a look of contempt, says \"ok,\" and then walks off. We were left outside waiting without any update for about 15 minutes and finally seated about 10:30 pm. Once seated, we had to wait for our waiter who seemed more intent on helping the boisterous patrons at the bar and of course wait for the food, about 45 minutes. What about some bread until our orders arrive? Good question. Well, the bread is fresh baked and of course they ran out and had to make more. So much for planning and execution.   There was a live tank with shellfish, but I couldn't find anything like that on the menu. I guess I didn't give the super secret handshake to get the special menu. Maybe the waiter had mentioned the specials of the day which included a shellfish dish, but I couldn't hear. Which brings me to my biggest gripe: the dÃ©cor. Concrete walls and floors, hardwood tables, and of course loud house music playing in the background and bouncing off everything. My girlfriend had to shout across our small two person table in order for me to hear her. I guess the restaurant was trying to be modern and hip with the loud music, open kitchen, and unfinished interiors.  So if you can put up with the somewhat rude service, long waits, and hate your sense of hearing, then the food is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Okay, you cannot go here weekly, but once a year I don't see a health problem. As you can see from many of the reviews, especially the lower rated ones, they are almost all lower because the reviewer stated \"too much fat\" etc. If you look at the other ratings, as of mine, that are 3 stars or below, you will notice a trends, food too rich.... I also laughed at some of the reviews that are lower rated, but they liked the \"salad\". Come on people, if you like salads and lite food, DON'T GO HERE.   Yes, this is true, too much fat, too much excess, too much everything. That is the point of this place. French country cooking to the extreme. Don't go here if you don't want to feel like you just ate a pound of butter after.   Go here if you want to experience the most savory, succulent goodness Quebec has to offer. I have posted 8 pictures of the dishes we ordered. All unreal in flavor and presentation.   We only had one night to experience this place so we ordered way too much. If I had more time in Montreal, I'd like go here early with friends, order one dish, and share it, before going for cocktails and a late dinner elsewhere. Also, I would recommend if you want to experience more dishes here, go multiple nights. The servings are huge. The pigs foot alone would feed a entire family plus left overs."}
{"text":"PDC, you get my 100th review.   When it came to be that my friend and I were going to be spending a couple nights in Montreal on our way to Ontario, I knew one thing I had to do, and it was eat at one of the hallmarks of modern restaurants in the country, Au Pied de Cochon. After anxiously awaiting email confirmation on reservations and receiving such, we were all set.  Located on the quaint Duluth Ave, PDC is almost easy to miss, without a lot of obvious signage, but we knew the street number that we were looking for. It was a lovely Sunday evening and the restaurant was mostly full, but we were seen to and seated immediately. For such a famous place, it isn't large and is somewhat narrow, although the open kitchen is a treat. It was interesting to listen to the hustle and bustle of the French and English as dishes were fired and would have made a good show from the bar in front of it, I'm sure.  My buddy and I were on a mission for some great food and we went all out, with two apps and a main each. I went with the pork rinds, cured foie gras tart and just had to try the namesake dish, pied de cochon.  The pork rinds came served in a classic sundae glass and were incredibly light and airy with lots of crackle and pop with each bite. There was a mild pork flavour and they were salted just right and altogether had a clean taste with no hints of old fryer oil.  I also snagged one of my friend's cod fritters. Crisp on the outside with a doughy (in a good way) center, with just the right amount of fish flavour and a hit of spice that came at the finish.  The foie gras tart was a hearty size, with a flaky pastry filled with mashed potato and slices of rich, velvety smooth foie gras, with a balsamic drizzle.  Now after these two appetizers I had been of the mind that I was going to get a single pig's foot or hock on some potatoes. It's a modern restaurant and the servings aren't the sort of size that you get at your run-of-the-mill chain family joint. Quality over quantity and all that. It seems however that with the pied de cochon anyway, that the PDC kitchen shoots for both quality and quantity. When my large dinner plate arrived, it was literally covered with food. I was expecting a lot more white space on my plate, and after two apps and a couple beers, I knew that my stomach couldn't nearly handle what was before me. It took me a couple minutes of food shock before I even started to dig in, resigned to the fact that even my hefty appetite stood no chance and that I'd be taking some of this back to the hotel and leaving some pride behind in its place.  Two sizable pieces of foot or hock lie beneath a heaping sauce of caramelized onions, peppers and cream while an equally impressive mound of mashed potatoes was topped with a fritter. The sauce was obviously quite rich and full of flavour while the pig's feet themselves had a thick skin that was still quite crisp despite the plentiful sauce. Pig's feet and hocks are quite fatty and can have a somewhat off putting texture because of this, but there was a great dark pork meat flavour to help offset all the fat. The potatoes are wonderfully smooth and seasoned, however the onion and dijon croquette was a bit too potent for my tastes.  This meal put me into a serious food drunk state for a couple hours, but it was more than worth it and if you're in town, you have to give this culinary institution a visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! Pretty much our main inspiration when planning a trip to Montreal (along with those Fremont bagels! lol).  I would recommend ordering (ahead) the pigs head! It is seriously the most delicious thing ever! Yeah people will gawk, I dunno why, but they do- let them! Its so flavorful, the skin is very crispy, the meat tender and full of flavor, and if your an adventurous eater- everything is good! The tongue, the brain, (the eyes if you wanna get all Bizarre Foods Ala Andrew Zimmern- we did, lol) everything on it is absolutely delicious! Should be good for 2 people, or 3 if you don't eat much.  Have also had the stuffed pied de cochon w/ foie gras and foie gras hamburger.  Both are very good and flavorful!   Fyi, I cannot understand the reviews that complain about the food being heavy...where did you think you were eating?? lol. The food is heavy, it is rich, it is delicious! If thats what your going for- come here. The vegans expecting a light dinner, um don't? lol.  Also, the service is super great. I remember a couple visits ago I dropped my butter knife, I saw a waiter approach me so I turned my head, in a matter of seconds of dropping that thing, one waiter replaced my knife and another picked the one I dropped off the floor!! I was like :O :O :O what is this crazy attentive service I am experiencing?? So awesome! All the peeps that have served us there have been very friendly, on top of service, given full descriptions of what we're interested in ordering, just fantastic!  Also, really love the vibe, its loud and fun, love the open kitchen, gives you something to look at. Last time we were there Emeril popped in for dinner and I just thought \"Yup, this place is the shizz!\"  Great restaurant, always leave feeling super full and satisfied! :)"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great spot, fantastic food, wonderful service.  We were going to do without appetizer but was told duck in a can takes 25 min so went with the tongue.  Very very good.  Duck in a can was rich, flavorful without being greasy (which I'm not sure how that's feasible, maybe it's the quality of the ingredients?).  Definitely a must have.  Hubby got foie gras tart with blood sausage which is good.  But if you're looking for seared foie gras, that's not it.  Finally, dessert.  We searched hard and found room!  Got the sugar pie with ice cream (so creamy but not heavy and soft...!) which was really good and lemon meringue pie which was good but just a tad sweet for my taste.    Really great spot!"}
{"text":"Was an excellent meal and we weren't rush. Service was very good. Restaurant is not huge. I had the croquettes as starters but would not recommend them. For the main, I had the signature dish, the pigs foot; it was very good; huge portion with mashed potatoes on the bottom, gravy, mushrooms, and two sizable pieces of seared foie gras on top. We asked the server for a red wine recommendation and were very impressed with the wine he recommended. The bread and butter on the table were good. Others in our group enjoyed the duck in a can and a fish and mussels appetizer dish. The food here is very rich, French style food. Most dishes have meat in them... but may be able to find some fish or vegetable dishes, if you lean that direction."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's my second time there. Reservations are nearly impossible, and unless you speak French, very difficult to change. Dishes I love are duck carpaccio, fois gras poutine, and the fish special, which was a seared swordfish."}
{"text":"After having been to the PDC Cabane Ã  Sucre twice in the last 5 years, I've been meaning to eat at the actual PDC restaurant in Montreal for a while now (last 5 years, to be precise). But it took this long... and unfortunately, my experience fell way short of expectations.   My partner had been in with a different set of people previously, and he loved it (he had the pork chop). He excitedly told me afterward that he had found this amazing restaurant he just had to take me to, only to realize that it was the exact same restaurant he'd been rejecting  every time I brought it up in the last 3 years. To remedy his faux pas, we made a date to go there for a special occasion last week.  Our reservation was for 5:30PM, and despite being early, we were seated promptly. Service was ok, although we may have irritated our server from asking too many questions (we were concerned about portions, because we weren't super hungry when we arrived...). The menu had a lot of items in it, but surprisingly not a lot of cochon (unless you wanted the stuffed PDC, which we didn't). My partner was pretty disappointed that the pork chop (or some variation) was not on the menu.  In the end, we got the foie gras poutine to start and one of the specials for our main: halibut for two. Yes, I know - why halibut in a restaurant famed for pig & foie? Well to be honest, they made a mean fish when we went to their multi-course sugar shack last year... so we were really hoping for a repeat of that perfectly cooked dish!  I also had the maple gin and tonic to drink, which is just as tasty as I remember (from the sugar shack). The poutine was pretty good - the foie gras adds a richness to an otherwise ordinary dish.  The disappointment lay solely on the halibut. The lentil stew with leek and mushroom was delicious enough; but the halibut was way too salty! I have a pretty high tolerance for salt, so it was an unpleasant surprise to admit that the fish was salty to the point of inedible. I didn't want to make a big deal about it, so we paid before I made the comment to the server. Which of course was just met with a sorry, you should have said something sooner (and maybe we could have replaced your food). Not sure if that was good enough, but whatever.   For a restaurant that charges a premium for their dishes, I expected a lot more. In the end, our business was already lost.. I just hoped that my comment may have prevented an unpleasant experience for other guests that made the wrong order.  We likely won't be going back anytime soon... if at all."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent.  We had the duck in a can which was wonderful.  And the sugar pie is exquisite. Definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"The hype - it's so real. Probably one of the best meals I've ever had, both for taste and for the memories. It's a beloved spot, and there's a reason for it. If you're a first-timer in Montreal, this should definitely be on your dinner list.   First, make reservations (we emailed). I can't stress that enough. We made reservations 3 months in advance of our weekend trip to Montreal, and I'm glad we did - we watched throngs of people trying to get in on a Friday night without a reservation and they were turned away.  Second, the environment. Bustling, boisterous, lively. Upscale feel but still comfortable and homey. Service was so sweet, not pushy at all, and made the effort to rattle off all 9 specials (by memory) including the price, so we wouldn't have to ask.  Third, the food. Rich, comforting, and so delicious. Note that this is a very, very heavy meal, with large, generous portions, so come hungry. We ordered: a) Cromesquis de foie gras (appetizer, $4.00), b) Charcuterie Plate (appetizer, $16.00), c) Beef Rib ($30.00), d) Pork Chop with lentils ($20.00), and e) drinks. Everything was delicious, but the standouts for us were both appetizers and the Beef Rib, which also came with mashed potatoes. So rich, delicious, fell off the bone with the softest way possible. Everything was incredibly tasty, carefully cooked. The charcuterie plate was the best I've ever had, and cured to perfection.   What else is there to say that hasn't been said already? I would definitely come back here again, and wholeheartedly recommend it, especially if you're a tourist in Montreal. The place is full of both tourists and locals, and is an atmosphere and meal you'll definitely remember.  With tax and tip, the bill came to around $105."}
{"text":"Oufff. An experience. Ultimately a super positive time, an exuberant, delicious, decadent family style dinner with piles of take-away containers to mitigate the otherwise overwhelming too muchness and waste.   So many courses I can't even. The ham in homemade donuts, the omelet covered in deep fried Parmesan cheese, the squid ink pasta with boudin, these were just a few of the memorable standouts. Our table, knowing this was likely a one-time thing for us, opted for the $70 additional tourtiere, which is a crazy thing to do, but was swoonworthy. After the first few courses we took smaller portions and started filling up the to-go containers which was the right move, because you need to leave room for dessert.   The frozen maple yogurt was tart and amazing, the banana cake was dreamy, and the optional flaming maple absinthe was the perfect digestif.   One hour out of town into the country, a $60 flat rate made this a very different experience from the downtown Au Pied de Cochon, less fancy and for me more fun and more worth experiencing. But I couldn't look at the leftovers the next day, my friends through them on the bbq and I had a salad. Very fun to experience, but likely just a one time thing for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Thursday night and were not impressed with the food. We ordered cocktails of the day, which were nothing special. We had asparagus with morels, which was alright, but too rich for an appetizer. For main course, we had poutine with fois gras and the signature pied de cochon. The poutine was subpar, fois gras really not adding much to it. Pied de cochon was good only for the first bite. It was mostly skin and a lot of fat, with a little bit of pork inside. It was served on a bed of mashed potatoes in a very rich sauce. We had a few bites and couldn't handle any more. Overall, a disappointing meal for the price."}
{"text":"What can I really say about Au Pied de Cochon that hasn't already been said countless times in any of the 988 (!) other reviews on this page? Their food is breathtaking, astounding, exquisite, and indelible, and you'll remember your meal for weeks, months, and years afterwards.  I had reserved well over a month in advance and we received a nice table near the front of the restaurant, which was bright and sunny and didn't feel nearly as crowded and cramped as it could've.  We were initially presented with complimentary bread and butter, and it was clear even at this stage that we were in for an above-average dinner. The crusty, fresh bread was delicious, but it was the butter that was the real winner. It tasted so much creamier and flavorful that normal butter, somehow. It was just so rich. Why isn't all butter like this?  For our appetizer, we decided to go with the Foie Gras Cromesquis. I had read a few reviews with recommendations of this and it seemed like a simple, not-too-filling way to start our meal. A server brought over two dice-shaped concoctions and advised us to wait a full 60 seconds before popping the whole thing into our mouths. I'm not entirely sure what was in this thing, but it was glorious. As soon as you bite in, this sauce or gravy oozes into your mouth and it tastes amazing. I could've eaten a whole bowl of these things.  For our main, we decided to share a couple of big-ticket items. First, we got the Foie Gras Poutine. I mean, would it surprise you to learn that this was amazing? The fries are perfectly cooked, the cheese curds are squeaky, the gravy is sublime, and the pieces of foie gras are spectacular and so, so tasty.  From there, we arrived at the piece de resistance of the entire outing: the infamous Duck in a Can. There's a great deal of showmanship that goes along with this dish, as the can is opened at the table by a server and the contents are poured onto a waiting plate. (And yes, we kept the can.) But oh my god is this thing amazing. Everything in this concoction is next-level in terms of flavors and textures, with the perfectly-cooked duck and rich gravy nothing short of delectable. This is one of the best things I've eaten in my entire life, hands down.  Our dessert was the Maple Poudding ChÃ´meur and it is, of course, delicious. It's basically cake sitting in a syrupy liquid, and it's addictive. I wouldn't have minded some ice cream in there to kind of cut through the intense sweetness, but this is an extremely minor complaint.  So why, you must be asking yourself, am I giving what was clearly a stellar meal four stars instead of five? The service. While I have nothing but praise for the incredibly friendly folks who brought us our food, our waitress was horrible. She took our order and we didn't see her again until it was time for the bill. This is not an exaggeration. I initially ordered a beer and probably would've had two or three more, but nobody asked if I wanted another. Like I said, other folks in the restaurant did stellar work and made sure our water was always topped up, but there really is no excuse for such ambivalent service from a waitress in a joint like this."}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon is exactly what we expected and wanted in Montreal. We wanted to be foie gras 'ed and ducked out and that is exactly what happened here!   This is an excellent restaurant! We started with Foie Gras Cromesquis. It comes with two little deep fried balls that are filled with melted foie gras. It just melts in your mouth. We then had the Foie Gras Champlain which is pan seared foie gras with maple syrup, bacon and some other good sweet stuff. That was the highlight of our meal. Lastly the main course was the duck in a can (of course). The duck in a can is a nice meat piece of duck with foie gras and some duck fat. It was excellent as well. We had a side of duck fat fries. It was ok but nothing special.  Unfortunately we did not leave space for dessert.   Be WARNED this food is very rich. Do not come here on a diet. This is NOT for persons looking to eat healthy."}
{"text":"BOOM! Place probably deserves 5 stars, but since I was dealing with a upset stomach I didn't get to fully enjoy it.  You have seen it on TV, read about in the NY Times and foodie (still hate that word) blogs. Now is your chance to try PDC, or at least mine.  I decided that for the grand prix weekend this year I forgo one case of beer and go and have a nice dinner. PDC had been on my radar for about 2 years. I knew I was going for fresh butchered Piggie and Fois Gras Poutine, but was going to play it by ear.  We arrived 10 minutes late for our 11pm reso, no problem and our party of 6 was sat promptly. Nice lay out open kitchen, it smelled if rich meats.  The seafood platter looked amazing but due to the groups stomach issues we decided to go with the roast piglet, cod fish fritters and smoked sausage. It was amazing. For entrees the some had the Pork Chop served on the bone( it looked amazing), another had the steak, which looked perfect. And I had the melting pot a bowled filled with yummy pig products, there was lion chop, rib chops, sausage and Blood Sausage (pig blood sausage) over I think cheesy potatoes!   There is reason that place has been called one of the best in Montreal they making good food for good prices! If you are traveling to Montreal or have lived there and not tried it, just go!  Oh and dont forget the Fois Gras Poutine :)"}
{"text":"Perhaps the only people who go here are so thoroughly prepared for the experience that they are always pleased, but I found the place nauseating.  The food is so excessively greasy, fatty and unhealthy that is makes feel ill to think about it.  The place and the patrons seems to celebrate that, but that's just hard for me to understand or appreciate."}
{"text":"I had the foie gras poutine. Fries were nice, not greasy, not too salty, nice crunch with substance. The foie gras was cooked perfectly and the sauce accompanying it was subtle. Perfect portion. Too bad the place is so noisy, though."}
{"text":"APDC is now on top of my favourite restaurant list! No wonder why it is so hard to get a reservation there. Ambience was fun and lively, and the food was just remarkable. My husband and I shared a Foie Gras Poutine (A MUST!!!!), duck carpaccio (YUMMMM!!), truffle omelette (nothing special), pig feet (wasn't so good, a little too rich, didn't finish it) and magret de canard (A BIG MUST!!!!!) We couldn't stop saying to each other how good the food was. Loved how we can watch the staff working in the open kitchen and absorb some of the great energy and passion that they shared in their food. Price is a little on high, but absolutely worth it. I will definitely recommend this place to everybody! Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"For our only night of dinner in Montreal, one of my friends called long in advance to reserve a table here, based on its fame for preparing duck (and foie gras in particular) really well. Funny, because she was the vegetarian in our party...with the reservation, getting seated was a cinch. The restaurant comes off as a lot more casual than one might think; it's about as loud as a bar is, and you have music playing in the background, adding to what comes off as a much more casual atmosphere. The menu is unfortunately a bit lacking in description (I think it's that way in French and English, so you're out of luck no matter what), which didn't help too much when we were trying to figure out what to order. Our service was pretty solid in bringing out our food and making sure our beer mugs were kept full.  As for the food itself, we started out with the tarragon bison tongue, which was really good. It's lightly cooked, but not overly done, giving it a texture that falls apart when you bite into it. The goodness of tarragon, mixed in with a cream sauce, really makes this a flavorful keeper as far as appetizers go. The onion soup is also really good here - it's got much more depth and flavor than most American versions of French onion soup have, and the cheese is present enough to give it flavor, but not dominate the dish when you take a bite. The maple-glazed fried chicken wings (which were a daily special) were also really good as far as wings go, but they're also incredibly sticky (you're provided a hot washcloth to wipe yourself off afterward). As for the main courses - well, we went all-out and had virtually a sampling of every meat dish there was. The house cut of pork was very succulent, although a big chunk of it was just fat and bone - which maybe explains why it weighed as much as it did. The terrine was phenomenally done here - one of the best I've had, and it worked really well with the apricot jam that was served alongside of it. The guinea hen (and yes, it's a full hen, complete with feet!) was pretty much what I'd expect from a chicken dish, although I did like the mashed potatoes combined with the gravy/broth that was left in the bottom of the pot. The duck magret was not terribly memorable (I would pass), while the duck in a can was very good. In particular, the foie has a texture that is somewhere between the kind that just melts as soon as you take a bite, and terrine. It works to add a substantive fattiness to the duck meat. Although we were absolutely stuffed at the end, we had to go for dessert, and I'm glad we did. The milkshake is not heavy at all, and it's got a nice hint of maple that really makes it a sweetly perfect way to finish off dinner. The ganache is also really good - with a bunch of crunchy nuts on top - but it's hard to beat the milkshake.  In all, we had a really solid dinner here. I wouldn't say it's necessarily the best of any of the meats I've ever had, but they do a really solid job with it. The food's a bit on the heavy side, and the portions are not small - so plan appropriately when ordering! I'd love to come back and try some of the other foie dishes, just to taste how many different ways it can be utilized."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of the fantastic service and the cod fritters. Our servers were very attentive and did our best to help our friend who is allergic to mushroom... not an easy task since it seems like everything had mushrooms in it. Went there with my wife and some good friends. Most of us had been waiting to go here for a long long time. We started with some cod fritters which were so fantastic that we thought we were in for a memorable meal... it was... but for mostly the wrong reason.   Several people at the table ordered THE speciality here, Duck in a can. It was absolutely terrible. First the fatty skin was not rendered at all so when it came out of the can it was one of the most un-appealing meal I have ever seen. Just a big chunk of fat on top of the duck. The duck was incredibly tough and really not edible. We sent it back (and again this goes back to good service, there were prompt and apologized) and they claimed it had a tendon in the breast but this was seemingly the case for the whole table. I had the pig's foot \"stuffed\" with foie gras and it clearly wasn't stuffed since the foie gras was just  sitting on top. That would have been fine but the meal was completely \"one note\" and had no outstanding flavors at all. The pouding chomeur was quite good in the end but not enough to redeem the meal and not enough to warrant how expensive the meal was. The room is also ridiculously loud and the floors by the bathrooms so greasy that it's treacherous to try and go in there. We won't come back here."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Pied de Cochon MontrÃ©al! Starting with the reservation: I sent an email asking for a reservation, but was told first that they were sold out, only to receive another email a couple of hours later to let me know a cancellation at the bar had opened. I immediately took it. When I got there the place was packed. However, I was offered a table and I was there, happily consuming my delicious meal (beet salad, fois gras, braised tongue and choco tart with ice cream), for almost two and a half hours! The maÃ®tre d' was gracious, the servers were warm and nice, and the food absolutely delicious. Although the settings, presentation and portions are obviously geared to family style servings, they did not skimp in attention to this \"je suis sole\" eater. Merci beaucoup, PDC!"}
{"text":"We saw this place on No Reservations and decided that it was to be our last meal of 2009.  We had the duck in a can.  It was the best $37 I've ever spent on a can.  The Carpaccio de Canard melts in your mouth and the Foie gras was simply the best I've had anywhere.  Tough getting a reservation though and You will have to wait past your reservation to be seated.  The sinks in the bathrooms are uber cool."}
{"text":"Unreal food, menu packed with thrilling meat adventures. Comfortable vibe, and waitstaff humored my friend and I as silly and excitable Americans."}
{"text":"I pied my cochon the food was do dam f'n good.  I poo'd my cochon being so bloated after the meal.  All jokes aside this dinner we had was fantastic. From the foie gras Poutine, foie gras burger, and the Duck in a can. They could not have cooked the food any better. Service did not exceed my expectation, but I was too busy and happy stuffing my face in foie gras."}
{"text":"This restaurant was on my list to try ever since I've seen it on No Reservations the service was excellent staff was very attentive ordered the fois gras appetizer which was delicious also the special half a duck with fois gras for 2 was ok definitely not worth the $150 they charged for it."}
{"text":"Phenomenal foix gras. 7 varieties. Meat hedonism at its finest!  Visited Montreal's finest...TouchÃ© and  Club Chase et Pece. This ranks among the best!"}
{"text":"Very hard to reserve, call ahead of time! Good food, worth to try.  Good service as well."}
{"text":"I had made it to the bar with two others in tow.  The time is 2100.  We landed in Montreal a day earlier in preparation for the appointment.  We drank in excess in an effort to increase our gastronomic satiety for the next day.  During the events right before zero hour, we had imbibed several beverages to escalate our appetite.  The time had come.  At the bar, we are greeted by an incredibly attentive, and attractive, female.  After receiving PDC's house brew, we order in succession three small plates and three large plates.  She smiles as she is taking down the orders without a pause.  That disarming smile may have ultimately been the coup de grace.  We were never prepared.  Small plates of seared foie gras, bison tongue with tarragon, and braised tripe special had come our way and were dispatched in reasonable time.  Somewhat surprised though, as we still had seemingly plenty of stamina after the first course, all of which were considered one of the richest appetizers ever encountered.  After the plates cleared, three much larger plates descended in front of us as we unnervingly watch on.  Then, a braised rib of bison arrived to our right.    We were in awe of the sheer size, larger than a forearm, until a braised pigs foot entered.  And then without being able to assess the objective in adequate time, a man arrived with a can.  Some explanation could be heard, but all of our senses had diverged to what emerged from the can.  A tremendous lump of duck breast with a massive layer of its own fat plopped out, carrying a payload of foie gras within it.  With knives and forks withdrawn, we each attack an item individually.  That proved to be disastrous.  Within minutes, each of us began to sag away for backup.  One by one, we would switch off and attempt to absorb the other piece.  After 30 minutes elapsed, it was clear what the results would be.  We laid down our arms and shed our whites.  Our faces sully, my eyes sunken as I peer at her face from behind the bar.  This time, she brandishes a smile unlike the one seen before.  She makes a quip that brought our spirits back, and even made me laugh a little.  Mercifully, she removes all of the plates and seals the contents in aluminum boxes.  What can be learned here?  PDC will beat you.  It will grind you into the ground.  It will show you no mercy.  But you're here.  You're reading yet another review about Au Pied de Cochon.  You're already a glutton for food punishment.  You're looking for the weird, the intense, and the insanity, all the while savoring in its delight, just as I had.  So send the email and go.  You already know you have to."}
{"text":"By now you know what you're in for when you reserve (weeks in advance!) a table here. Bacon, sausage, duck fat, fois gras, pigs feet, more duck fat, etc. But everything is done spectacularly well-- the wild chef indeed. The fat doesn't escape the food in a way that would leave your plate, fingers, napkin soaked through. It's fattening sure, but it's not greasy. Thoughtful and flavourful, this food is that perfectly tender, melt-in-your mouth fare that it's all hyped up to be.   Considering how upscale the ingredients are and presentation is, you'd expect to pay more but the price is actually quite more than reasonable. Started with the cromesquis (bited sized squares of hot and runny duck fat encapsulated in deep fried batter-- get one, get two!!), indulged in duck in a can (topped with the biggest chunk of fois I've ever seen) and split a bottle of red, all for under $65. There's no needs for sides. I'm completely boggled that some people order french fries on the side of their pieds de cochons. The portions are massive and there's no looks when you order a doggy bag.   Service for me was fast and the staff was hospitable without being annoying.   This place is regularly touted as the best restaurant in Montreal, and I'm right there with those that proclaim it as such. This place is single-handedly rewriting the history of quebec gastronomie. A MUST."}
{"text":"Been to APDC a few times and must say it is one of those foodie religious experiences.  From the foie gras smothered Poutine to Duck in the Can to EVERYTHING I have had there, there was mad love on the plate. In the summer the raw bar selections were also impressive.  Thanks to Tony Bourdain for showing me the light years ago on No Reservations.  Great wine list to boot and the waitstaff is terrific. One of my five favorite restaurants in the world."}
{"text":"Obviously you are in for a gluttonous experience when you come to this place, but there was some silliness afoot.   For example, we saw fresh eels in the tank when we entered so we decided to try the eel appetizer. What showed up at our table?  Three miniature baked russet potatoes with rice on top and tiny pieces of eel on top of the rice, wrapped in nori. Anyone who has ever eaten and enjoyed eel knows what a delicious and delicate ingredient it is, and to toss a small sliver on top of a baked potato makes zero sense. It was a dish that needed some serious editing. We couldn't eat it. We sent it back.  The rest of the food was very rich and heavy, but I can't say it wasn't good. The bison tongue was fantastic. That said, we wished our waitress had warned us against ordering three appetizers for two people; by the time the pied du cochon arrived we were so full that we could barely eat it. We literally took about three bites each and felt nauseous and like we were going to burst.  Certainly an experience; just be sure to go hungry and look out for wackiness. And if you are looking for a better way to go big on dinner in Montreal, I'd suggest Joe Beef. Just as expensive, but the quality is way beyond that of APC."}
{"text":"This place deserved 5 stars (that I give very very rarely). We had so many so-so experiences since arriving in Montreal, so this is definitely a place to try if you are not a vegetarian! All the meat dishes and even seafood (lobster, oysters) are prime quality.   Try the Bison Temaki a new rendition of spicy tuna sushi except with a creamy tartar of bison meat. The poutine is right there, as a simple comfort food that is simple still very easy to fail (in many touristy places around the city). We had the very decent size portion of the Happy Pork Chop. Tender inside and crispy on the outside with a delicious mushroom and cranberry sauce. The co-owner told us the Pork Cut was the same but much larger at 1/2kg of meat... As an appetizer I ordered the special du jour and my friends that was out of this world!! A duck tartelette (mini pie) filled with meat and mushrooms, the whole pie being covered when served with a smooth and creamy sauce made with foie gras, morel mushrooms and herbs.  Go try this place but book it in advance as I have never seen a kitchen so busy."}
{"text":"This one had been on my list for a while, it's almost crazy that I hadn't yet made it!   We came in on a cold night, so heavy food was in order. We went for the duck in a can and the stuffed pig foot with foie gras. Both were good, but it is a bit messy. It's rich, heavy and I can see why people love it. For me, it is fine, but a bit uninspired for the price."}
{"text":"Drool*!  Came here with some girls for one of our bachelorette night dinners out and had such a fun time! Wine, fois gras poutine (omg drool*), duck in a can, special crab salad, carpacciothe tartare, hand rolls and more that i can't even remember now..  The food was so yummy! I cannot pick a favorite! Though actually my least favorite was duck in a can, but i'm glad we tried it! Was a cool experience :) The waitstaff was so nice and helpful, very patient and knowledgeable of the dishes and wines. The place get super busy and packed, but why wouldn't they?  I would definitely come back when i'm in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"DeuxiÃ¨me visite Au pied de cochon. Nous y sommes allÃ©s avec des touristes AmÃ©ricains. Ils ont adorÃ©.

DÃ¨s la premiÃ¨re journÃ©e de l'ouverture de leur livre d'or des rÃ©servations j'Ã©tais sur mon ordinateur. Je dirais mÃªme dÃ¨s les premiÃ¨res minutes. Envoi fait le 1er dÃ©cembre, confirmation reÃ§ue Ã  la mi-janvier pour une rÃ©servation dÃ©but mars. La salle Ã  manger de la cabane est petite. On est un peu coincÃ©.   Le menu est trÃ¨s innovateur, soda-wisky avec morceaux de jello Ã  l'Ã©rable, tourtiÃ¨re avec porc effilochÃ©, poulet farci au homard, omelette avec morceaux de lardons et autre.....   Une partie du dessert a Ã©tÃ© servie en entrÃ©e, whippet Ã  l'Ã©rable, barbe Ã  papa, beurre d'Ã©rable, flan Ã  l'Ã©rable, croissant Ã  l'Ã©rable et aux amandes (un des meilleurs croissants que j'ai mangÃ©).   Le service et impeccable, simple et sympathique. Martin Picard est toujours aussi accessible et prÃ©sent. Ce n'est pas un environnement trÃ¨s baby-friendly et menu pas idÃ©al pour les enfants. Je le recommande Ã  tous, sauf au vÃ©gÃ©tarien. Ã essayer une fois dans sa vie. Pour ma part, je vais rÃ©server Ã  chaque annÃ©e."}
{"text":"Great service! Great foods! This meal is very heavy but too good! My favourite dishes is stuffed Pied de Cochon & Foie gras. The Pecan pie with homemade maple sirup ice cream is a must try."}
{"text":"Beautifully orchestrated plates. I actually went there a month ago - we had the finest pig's head, fuagra, duck in a can - wonderful dishes, amazed by excellent sellection of wines. I already made a reservation in June for my next trip with my parents, expecting the grace again.  Wonderful, experienced waitresses too. A must visit."}
{"text":"Exciting intro to food truck culture in Mtl.  Duck legs with maple glaze were delicious - 2 for $5.  Foie gras poutine in a personal size for $7 was very tasty - great sauce and fresh curds, however, fries were quite cold - boo :( ...  Looking forward to going back to try the donut pork sandwich.    I'm not sure why Aella M.'s review is even allowed to count toward this food truck rating.  Seems like it was a rating about the price of water... which if I recall was actually $2... (but I was busy eating foie gras poutine and duck legs)"}
{"text":"We had the foie gras poutine, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras and a tuna dish.  All were very rich in flavor and will lead to a heart attack BUT worth every bite.  Poutine- get it! after all it is a Canadian dish Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- this is large enough for 3-4 people to share, the best part about this dish was the MASHED POTATO, it is sooooooooo good! it has a different texture from the typical mushy mashed potato.  Tuna dish- our waiter picked this for us so I don't know what it's called but it's a pretty good dish with gravy and mashed potato on the bottom but it was a little salty though.   Overall, amazing FATTY French Canadian food."}
{"text":"Hmmm...I'm not really sure how to start this one. So this is definitely NOT the place to bring your vegetarian friend. Or even your vegetable-liking friend. Because serious, any veggie you find will be covered and smothered in delicious meat fat of some sort.  Onions? sure, they have them, sautÃ©ed in pork fat and slathered in butter. Potatoes? yep, a decent amount of them as well, covered in gravy and mashed with...bacon grease? butter? I'm not entirely sure, but it's something delicious.   Foie gras aux pommes ($26): amazing. Although I prefer my dishes a little more savory, the flavors mixed together sublimely, and the balsamic reduction paired like heaven.  Carpaccio de canard (I think around $14): also delicious. Mustard + raw duck + green onion + olive oil = nom.   PotÃ©e du PDC ($22): dear lord. one human being should not have access to this much pork. Or to this many forms of pork. Fantastic, but seriously sweating pork for the next few days.  Tarte de boudin ($17): I ate ONE slice of the boudin that night. Not to say it wasn't good, just by this point I had OD'd on pork. We took the rest home, and it made a wonderful snack on the train the next day. The boudin itself is melt-in-your-mouth soft, and the mustard that they both bake into it and garnish it with is divine.  So glad they had beer ($5ish a pint) to wash down all the grease!"}
{"text":"If I could eat here every single day, I would.  Fortunately for my cholesterol, home is in a different, albeit neighboring, country.  The poutine au foie gras is amazing!  And who doesn't love the duck in a can?  The meat was just so tender, flavorful, and succulent with a rich, earthy flavor.  And did I mention that it is served with a cauliflower puree?  I love cauliflower and it is so rare to see it in restaurants.  Anyhow, this was easily one of the best meals of the trip.  Definitely make reservations here if you are in the area or visiting."}
{"text":"I genuinely cannot understand how this place has the ratings and high acclaim that it does. The treatment we received from the hostess and servers was simply atrocious.   After hearing the high acclaim and a positive recommendation from friends who had eaten here the night before - we were thrilled to dine at Au Pied de Cochon the following night.   We made the reservation weeks in advance at the only available time - 10:30pm. We decided to show up a little earlier in hopes we could be seated prior to 10:30. We approached the hostess stand and proceeded to wait there approximately 10 minutes until a hostess showed up and acknowledged us. We gave her our name and reservation information and we were told we could not be seated until 10:30. I completely understand that. We asked if we could get a drink from the bar while we waited. The answer was no. The reason? People are eating at the bar and we can't go get a drink\". So we had to go wait outside.   We were sure to stand where the hostess would see us to ensure we wouldn't be missed when it was our turn to be seated. After waiting through the rain outside, the time passed 10:30pm. It was extremely frustrating to see people walking right up to the restaurant and being seated right away AFTER our reservation time. After seeing this, we approached the hostess again to find out what was going on. She looked up at us and greeted us as brand new customers, acting as if she had never seen us before. We had to provide her with our name and reservation information again for her to cross-check. Without any regret or apologies, we were finally seated.   The table was directly in a walk way and it didn't take me long to realize the ceiling was leaking and I was being dripped on throughout the entire meal. Especially fun after waiting in the rain for so long.   We were ignored by wait staff for another 10 minutes prior to a server finally engaging us. Our friends who had dined there the night before told us their waiter was fabulous at explaining the menu and making suggestions so we asked the same of ours. He provided no such help. We were rushed into making some sort of selection. This was the last time the server came to our table.   Somebody else delivered our food. We had to ask for silverware. The fries included in the poutine tasted old and for the amount given - was not worth the price at all. The duck in a can was overly rich. I had a few bites and called it a day. I was already so frustrated we were giving this establishment any of our money. If I could do it again, I would have left after the hostess fiasco. We were hoping the food would redeem the service. It did not.   A third person came by to process our payment. When she asked how everything was I had a really hard time crafting a response for that. We told her we weren't impressed. She said sorry and got us on our way.   I'm having trouble determining why our experience was SO terrible when the reviews for this place are so high. What is it about us?! It appeared people around us were receiving good service and so had our friends the night before. Must be something about me.   Horrible."}
{"text":"I loved:  - foie gras poutine  I liked:  - maple creme brulee  Just ok:  - Duck in a can. After eating duck and foie gras for 3 nights, I found this to be underwhelming. It was a small portion of duck (Joe Beef wins on portion size), and the winner in terms of taste would go to Le Quartier GÃ©nÃ©ral.  Expect dinner to take up 2 hours because service in Montreal is slow everywhere."}
{"text":"A bizarre evening of big hits and misses that couldn't quite justify the high prices or tourist-inflicted hype.  We came in a group of six so we'd have a chance to share things and taste more of the famously foie gras* intensive menu.  Things started off well enough with appetizers:  - Foie Gras Cromesquis: little fried blocks with a tad of foie gras inside, these were warm, savory, packed with flavor, and gone in an instant. - Tarragon bison tongue: unbelievably tender, flavorful and a bit fatty as tongue tends to be.  A nice small portion allowed a few of us to have a taste of it. - Duck Carpaccio: this sounded like something that prudish US food safety inspectors would never allow, so we were sure to order it while in Canada.  It was light and magical like a beef carpaccio.  Again, a nice small portion.  Still not much foie gras action, but we ordered main courses with foie gras including one with a filet type serving from the \"foie gras\" section of the menu... we were the most excited about that one.  These dished came out (pause for emphasis) about _70_ minutes after our appetizers were served, and the one with the foie gras filet (bigger pause) _never_ came at all.  Anyway, these included:  - Their trademark \"pied au cochon\" (which we ordered without foie gras because we thought it was coming with the other dish).  A little unusual in its gooey sinewy texture, this is the kind of thing that works as an appetizer but is just overwhelming as a main dish.... which is certainly was, and more than enough for two people.  Share it family style if you must order it, but it's a miss otherwise.  - Their even more trademark \"Duck in a can.\"  This one was indeed a hit, and the biggest success of the evening.  It included half a duck (with a nice chunk of duck fat that you probably don't want to finish) plus 100g of foie gras, and plenty of delicious sauce including butter, oil, something basalmic, and thyme.   We shared it three ways but it would have been better split two ways or consumed as a large meal for one person.  - A special risotto ($80 plus $20 extra for foie gras) prepared in a parmesan cheese wheel bowl that infused (too much) parmesan flavor.  It was nice for a few bites, but the rich, creamy and salty melted parmesan completely drowned out the more subtle (and expensive and even more delicious) foie gras which is a big culinary bummer at any price, let alone $100.  - Poutine which was about as good as that from Belle Provence but not as good as that from Frite Alors, because the fries weren't crunchy enough.  Not sure why they offer it.  Service was very polite and attentive, when it existed.  Fortunately we had a nice group with great conversation but waiting over 60 minutes for dinner after appetizers does funny things to your appetite... especially when they serve you unlimited french bread in the meantime.  So, in the end we had great appetizers, no foie gras filet, and main dishes in all the wrong proportions for a pretty high price tag.  Given how great others' experiences seem to be here, I'd like to come back, maybe in a smaller group their staff could handle better, and maybe with more concrete info about what to order and not.     *Having heard rumors of epic cruelty in Foie Gras production, I checked out all free the well-written articles I could find online, as well as the first two YouTube videos on it (one pro and one con).  I was insufficiently horrified by what I found especially versus beef production, but please message me if you have a better link."}
{"text":"Truly a transformative experience. We ate the chicken nuggets filled with foie gras, duck in a can, foie gras poutine, and stuffed pig foot and sugar pie for dessert. Everything was 5 out of 5 stars! There was a mix up with our reservation which left us waiting for over an hour for a table. They totally made up for it by providing excellent service and amazing food. I can't recommend this place enough. Make a reservation today!"}
{"text":"Probably my fifth time dining at Au Pied De Cochon. The ambiance, service and food is always great! I recommend ordering the tartare temaki, bone marrow, foie gras burger and the foie gras poutine.   Is it one of my favorite restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"I have to say, I had expectations. And they weren't exactly met. The food was good, but (and I can't believe I'm saying this), it was too indulgent. Visited in December  2013.   We had a pretty simple order. An appetizer. Two mains. Drinks.   The off-menu Christmassy appetizer, which was a slice of foie gras, fruit cake, and goat cheese, was interesting. It was an odd melange of flavours, but we didn't come here for typical restaurant fare. So the appetizer got us excited for the mains.   My date had duck in a can. It was pretty good from what I tasted. Today all she remembers is plate full of Brown and won't be eating foie gras again, though she's glad she's tried it.   I had the off menu (and highly recommended by our server) veal shank with cauliflower mash. The mash was amazing. Really soft textures with a few lumps here and there. Mixed in with the juices of the shank and you got this beautiful velvety texture. Definite win.   The shank left more to be desired. Not because it was small (it was epic meal time huge) but because the flavours transformed from beefy goodness to oh-my-god-this-carcass-never-ends. And that's what it felt like after a while. The soft texture eventually reminded me of cutting and chewing into raw flesh. And with the gamey smell and the beefy flavour just lingering in my mouth, I had to abandon the dish.   I never abandon dishes. And I didn't abandon this one because it was too much food and I was too full, but because the flavours and textures became repulsive halfway through the experience. I only got though 1/3 of that shank.   I don't regret trying this place but it's unlikely I'll return."}
{"text":"This is only regarding the blueberry beignets. It was 1 for 2.50 or 6 for 10, thus we got 6.  It was super duper sweet and tasted basically like any fast-food donut filled with blueberry jam. My dentist would not approve =(  Wish they still had Foie Gras poutine... the guy said it may come back mid 2014..."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch at 10:30ish on a chilly Sunday morning. Surprisingly, there was no wait at all, and almost half the restaurant was empty.  Their brunch is served 'dim-sum' style, with servers pushing around carts with various dishes which they mark on a sheet on your table.  We ordered tons: Mushroom paperdelle (pasta) Omelette Eggs benedict A non Foie Gras terrine Foie Gras terrine Lobster pot stickers Baked beans with sausage Potatoes with Foie and camembert Tourtiere  Unsurprisingly, everything was super rich, personally a bit too much. I wish there was a bit more balance. Would definitely recommend the FG terrine, as it was well balanced on a fruitcake and with a cranberry compote. Also, the potatoes with foie and camembert were great, can't go wrong with crispy tubers and cheese and foie.   The paperdelle, non-FG terrine and pot-stickers were okay. Baked beans were really hearty and the tiny piece of sausage was delicious but didn't seem too special. Would definitely avoid the Eggs Benedict. It was too rich and salty, they used non-smoked salmon and a ton of hollandaise. Would also not order a tourtiere at brunch here again, you have to get it hot to order, as it kind of dried out on us on the cart.  The servers were really nice, explaining each dish in either English or French. Atmosphere was good, filled with semi-annoying foodies like myself snapping pictures on our phones.  All in all, a very rich meal, but wouldn't order everything that we did again."}
{"text":"From start to finish- Au Pied du Cochon delivers a positively unbeatable meal. Be prepared to have your mouth hugged.  Yes, this is not a restaurant you should visit on a strict diet. It's the kind of place you should go to if you've only had a banana all day because it's impossible to leave there with any room in your stomach.  Martin uses local, fresh ingredients and produce and doesn't spare anything. The flavours are rich, well-thought and there is such care to his meals. My favourite meal is the Duck in a Can by far. Start with a Foie Gras lollipop and you'll never try anything else.  It's refreshing to find a place in Montreal that concentrates on simple flavours instead of trying to cloud a dish with creamy sauces and spices.  Be prepared to spend about $40 on your main course and don't even think about wine unless you've hit the video lotto jackpot the night before.  Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Duck in a can was amazing.  But the best tasting I had was when I through my duck fries into the my foie gras that had melted."}
{"text":"The ambiance is tavern feel. I love the ambiance and the food is so so... I am so sorry for not liking the Quebecois food there, it is a bit too greasy for me and not enough veggies. Hey, we are paying extremely high price there, obviously they serve the best in the market. Regardless, my first time there was nice but I wouldn't go back because the food is not my thing."}
{"text":"Wow. Foie gras poutine That dish was so tasty, you  Must get it- plus scotch*  *they had a scotch cocktail special and it was so good that I only had *one* during the whole dinner. Duck in a can- not pretty but delicious- would not get again"}
{"text":"In its category the food at PDC is not worthy of a higher rating than one star.   I almost did not get in this past weekend since my reservation was somehow lost despite a voicemail confirming it. Service did their best but was slow. PDC was out of two wines that were on the menu. I don't know if I just had bad luck with the two I wanted, but, I can only guess they were out of other bottles as well. They were also out of the foie gras dish I asked for.   At the recommendation of the server I ordered the Plogue Ã  Champlain. This dish has a lot of potential but was not executed correctly. The dish was seared foie gras on top of English style bacon, potatoes and a crepe with the entier dish soaked in maple syrup. One of the components was cold and the foie gras was charred on the outside and close to rare on the inside.   The only good dish of the night was the Tomato Tartlet that had a very good pastry crust.   The proteins in the PDC's Melting Pot were not seasoned at all. The mash was good and I had to use it to get any flavor on the proteins.   The special rib eye steak, recommend by the server over Shepherd's Pie was decent but nothing I could not prepare at home with a quality product.   The worst dish of the night was the special desert. The summer pudding consisted of a 'cooked' shortbread with 'fresh' summer beers. The shortbread was under temperature and the berries had to have come packaged in syrup.   A side of fries that was ordered with everything else never came.   The one star is on the food alone. Based on all the hype and reviews here I don't know what to make of my one experience here. Was it an off night? In any event my meal was simply not good."}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite meals in Montreal. I love game meat, I love foie gras, et j'adore la cuisine QuÃ©bÃ©coise, so I was in heaven here. However, you should probably not go here and expect an elegant fine dining experience. It's pretty small, very crowded, and very loud, and has a very casual interior with wooden tables - it's not a place you necessarily need to get dressed up for. You definitely need a reservation if you don't want to stand waiting for hours; we had a reservation and got seated within about 15 minutes, but there were people who got there before us that were still waiting 2 hours later.  Despite the inventiveness of the menu and the relatively high prices, the food is not really haute cuisine per se. However, that does not make it any less delicious, in my opinion. The foie gras section on the menu has over 10 selections, but some of them make you go \"whaa...?\", like foie gras poutine and foie gras hamburger. The atmosphere is a lot like my favorite restaurant back home, which is not too fancy but just has really good food. The wine list was excellent with an extensive French selection. We started out with a bottle of Pouilly-FuissÃ©, but since the bottle we ordered was not available, the manager brought us out a Pommard he said was even better and was also less expensive, which was very nice. We started out with a plate of mixed pÃ¢tÃ© and some zucchini blossom tempura - the tempura was very light and pleasing. We moved on to two more delicious dishes, a tomato tartine and tarragon bison tongue. The tart was on this light fluffy pastry dough, and the bison tongue was extremely tasty. By that time we had moved on to a bottle of Old Vine ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape, also excellent. Our main course was the foie gras poutine - just had to do it - seared foie gras on top of fries, gravy, and cheese curds, and it was everything I thought it would be. I figured I was probably only going to have poutine once so it might was well be the most decadent. We finished things up with a dessert of maple churros, espresso and cognac. Afterwards the manager came by our table and brought us each a complimentary shot of Bushmills and drank it with us. It was just a really great experience.  P.S. I read a quote about this place afterward that gave me a smile: \"No animal is safe from his kitchen\""}
{"text":"Staff was incredibly friendly. I didn't have a reservation and she said they were fully reserved unti 10pm (I got in at 8:30pm). She said to wait 20 minutes just in case and in less than that, I was seated and then proceeded to eat delicious foie gras and the mashed potatoes were fantastic. I don't eat pork but they were able to easily accommodate me. I really enjoyed sitting at the bar with the kitchen in front of me -- highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If \"Au Pied de Cochon\" were a rock band, it would be Queen circa 1979. And if Chef Marc Picard were a rockstar, he would be a latex-clad, cocaine-snorting, sex-crazed Freddie Mercury. This restaurant is pure rock 'n roll on a plate. Uncompromising, unhealthy, and unlike anything you've ever tasted.  I had heard about it from my friend in Montreal, and like many others, had drooled in delight at the Bourdain \"No Reservations\" segment filmed at the restaurant. For a serious gourmand, foie gras is up there with caviar, truffles and oysters in the \"leave your pre-conceptions behind\" department. It is also one of the most delectable things on the planet, and Monsieur Picard simply knows how to do it. Right.   There is simply no point in coming to this restaurant if you are not willing to put yourself, and your health, at risk. In all honesty, I would recommend three things:  1) A group of friends who love food, and by love I mean ADORE it. They must also love foie gras, specifically. 2) A full de-tox the day prior, with perhaps a few pieces of celery to keep the body going. But for God's sake, do not eat a regular meal within the 24 hour window period preceding the pig-out. This is a religious experience, and as such it must be treated with reverence, discipline, and a little fear. 3) Start smoking and/or go to the gym on a regular basis, because the only thing that can tame the foie gras coma you will be in is half-a-pack of smokes, or a swift 15-minute walk around the block right before dessert.  With that in mind, we arrived prepared and loaded with cash. The place is expensive, but I am not even going to get into a financial dissection. How much would you pay to see Freddie Mercury live? Exactly. Some things exist beyond crumpled pieces of cash, or faded plastic credit cards. Some things are immortal- like Freddie, or foie gras. The clientele is generally quite youthful- between 25-40. Nobody in their right mind would eat here past 40 without a cardiologist by their side. It's a good space, not huge, with so-so acoustics. Realistically though, you won't have time to talk much since your mouths will be occupied 80-85% of the time. Think of it as a foie gras bordello, with you as the old hooker.  So we began. We ordered a Foie Gras burger; pan-seared Foie Gras; the infamous Duck-in-a-can; the pig's foot; an assortment of vegetables; and an absolutely out-of-this-world bottle of Cotes de Provence. So good, in fact, that we went for the same bottle twice. Of course, we shared everything.  The burger was \"monstrous\". The waiter had warned me, but I was on a suicidal mission and decided to order it as my appetizer. It's basically a lean beef burger doused in a balsamic reduction, with a slab of foie gras on top. The burger buns were crunchy and firm (presumably to hold the whole structure together), and though it needed some serious scaffolding work half-way through, it held together nicely. The whole thing was a knock-out punch to the senses. Strong, aromatic, but surprisingly well thought-out, with the foie gras giving a creamy after taste to each beefy bite.   It is often the simplest dishes that reveal the true artistry in the kitchen, and the quality of ingredients. Please welcome dish numero deux, the pan-seared foie gras- possibly the simplest dish on the menu. Served with garlic crostini and a mild balsamic reduction (notice the trend), the foie gras was crispy on the outside but revealed a molten, sweet center. This is not the kind of foie gras we are often accustomed to- the mousse-like paste to be spread onto bread or toast. This is the liver itself, unprocessed and untainted. Beautiful.   By this point we were starting to feel the calorific after-burn, but the best was yet to come.   The duck-in-a-can is a mechanical marvel. A waiter comes over with a tin can labelled \"canard en conserve\". A deep plate is placed in front of you, and in it is a bed of pillowy mashed potatoes. The waiter then cracks the can open, and pours its content over the mashed potatoes. Magically, the mashed potatoes are joined by half a mallard duck, jus, foie gras, garlic, balsamic demi-glaze and other heavenly ingredients. There are literally are no words to describe the richness and exquisite taste. Comparing it to anything I'd previously eaten would border on criminal.  Similarly, the pied de cochon  is a delicate oven-roasted miracle stuffed with foie gras. It was at this point that my friend and I looked at each other and realized that we were born in the wrong century. In our food-fuelled daze, we saw each other as feudal lords, or kings, feasting on pig, engorged liver and wine, loving every second of it. The restaurant is essentially a time-warp to the land of gluttony. If Henry VIII were alive, he would have a permanent reservation in the back.   Life is short, cholesterol is over-rated, and ducks are generally unimpressive creatures with little-to-no personality. Raise your glass to Monsieur Picard, and rock 'n roll."}
{"text":"It's all about the food here. If you love fois gras, this is the promised land. They fois gras the shit out of everything. Personally that makes me happy. Lots of great things on the menu but the fois gras burger and the French onion soup were highlights for me. There is also a great wine list and the staff are very helpful."}
{"text":"My favourite resturant in the world, you always walking out feeling a bit too full... everything is great, especially any specials he has... soooooo tasty....  good house brew too"}
{"text":"Talk about a great dining experience. This place is a MUST VISIT. When looking at the menu one might think \"why would I pay 44$ for duck in a can?\" or \" 39$ for a foie gras burger?\"but trust me this place is worth every penny. If you are a visitor, or a local this place can't be beat! Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review day after dinner so it's still fresh. Let me start off I was kind of skeptical of going there as I don't really mess with foo grai..lol. It's not really big in Nj/ny but I really wanted to try the place as we literally stayed around the corner from there. I called literally 2 days before and was able to get fri night reservation for 930pm which actually ended up perfect for us . My uber driver talked about the place and told us to try the duck fries and place was awesome which got us even more excited. From the minute we walked in we were excited. Cozy little set up and were seated for 4 right away. Place is pretty loud but great atmosphere. Our waiter was awesome explained everything on the menu with a cool French accent  along with all specials that were out. One thing I wish they explained that portions which are pretty big and some can feed more than 2 people such as the specialties had  duck confeit. Wine list is extensive and we ended up with a bottle of red light bodied mergot 2014 for 62 bucks Canadian which was recommended by our waiter. Wine was awesome just perfect for all types of dishes and tastes.  Wines look like can get expensive as there only a few under 100 bucks. They brought some delicious warm bread with butter and for appetizers we picked putine fries which was good but super heavy. 2nd appetizer was pasta with dry smoked sausage not sure what was called as as was off the menu and a special but great. We ordered Guinea hen for 2.. 90$( more like for 3 people I would say) it was amazing!! Cooked to perfection super crispy skin with great gnocchi mixed with peas and garlic. Great combo I  say no need to order any other sides. WARNING TAKES 50 min to cook. So order right away or some appetizers as that's how long it will take. The other 2 dishes were off special menu -duck confeit which was super good and crispy and nicely glazed with a bed of mashed potatoes with sauce of apples and most likely maple syrup as u can't go without especially in Canada. The other meal was fettuccini with pork pieces with aged cheddar.This was prepared table side which was a show stopper for everyone around and I'm attaching a video if the special still available definitely worth ordering. Be prepared bill came to over 350 Canadian  for 4 ,but all worth it for the experience.  Awesome place!! Overall experience 5 stars, everyone in group loved it. Would definitely recommend to all my fellow Americans as service was attentive and awesome. 1 thing about the place I would Change which would be bathrooms to allow more people as literally there was 2 lines for them.. They need it!!"}
{"text":"It's been 48 hours. The shakes have almost stopped but the memory of my dinner there will haunt me for the rest of my life.   We left coasters from California live under the totalitarian regime of rightousness that has banned Foie Gras in all of its glorious forms. There are secret handshakes, gifts from the chef to duck the ban and protestations that federal land is exempt from this draconian law.   That is California. This is Montreal.   At Au Pied de Cochon Foie Gras is the star: a big creamy star that leaves you panting, slightly parched and biting your lip as if you've just experienced your lover's lips for the firs time.   There are many forms of Foie at Cohon: from deep fried 1 bite morsels of liquified livery goodness to classic terrines and the mother of all pig and goose liver mash-ups: the pig leg stuffed with seared foie gras. One decadent and insanely tasty ingredient that morphs into a myriad of dishes and accoutrement to other culinary creations and delights.   The menu is a static affair at Cochon. It's a fixed entity according to our waiter, but the specials change on a daily basis and are all based on ingredient availability. The night we were there it was a slow, 8 hour long, braised veal shoulder steak with white wine and onions. The exterior of the meat had taken on that great consistency of fibers desiccated of their juices and now caramelized like the onions in the pan. The meat fell apart at the mere suggestion of the fork's whimsy.   To get us going we had bison tongue in a tarragon wine sauce, a bison tartar tamaki hand roll, pickled herring that bore more resemblance to the sweet tradition of Poland rather than the heavily brined Dutch or Russian varieties. Not a single bad dish, fantastic service and the haunting feeling that I will carry the taste of those meats on the tip of my tongue for years to come."}
{"text":"This is where a fellow non-pork eater and I accidentally ingested blood sausage because the server said it was \"boudin\". This is also where I expanded my kinky French lexicon. Order the duck in a can then feel your piehole drop as it is opened in front of you and flipped over on a plate to reveal a steaming heap of perfectly cooked, succulent bird.    Anthony Bourdain's been here, and so have I...which pretty much means I'm the shit."}
{"text":"Do you like foie gras?  piggy?  shellfish platters?  If you answered no to these questions, don't go to PDC.  If you said yes, then beg, borrow or steal yourself a reservation to this reasonably priced, extremely delicious, fun and casual restaurant.  We got insanely lucky, and our hotel was able to get us a same-day reservation... and then once we were there the sous-chef was nice enough to squeeze us in again the following night.  PDC two nights in a row!  It's hard to pick the pinnacle of the meals... was it when we were served a pig's head, with a lobster in the pig's mouth?  or perhaps it was one of the many astounding foie gras dishes... or maybe the two 'ducks in a can' that we got as takeaway food, to eat after we'd gone home from Montreal.  PDC is advertised as being a great place for lovers of pork, foie gras and shellfish, and it does what it says on the box."}
{"text":"I dine at APDC just about every time I visit Montreal, which is often but have found little to add to the excellent reviews posted on Yelp..... Until now.  It strikes me that after all these years of a packed house every day and a unchanged menu that APDC would have \"shot it's load\" years ago but no....the standards and specials are as current, and delicious as ever and service ,while casual, is still friendly,helpful and efficient . I love the mix of diners and vibe here,typically Quebecois in it's languid pace and joyous celebration of good food,drink and company. We tend to get an early reservation to allow for all the fatty and heavy dishes to digest and then stroll around St Denis and mingle with all the beautiful people.  A truly great dining experience.......every time."}
{"text":"What can I say? This is my all-time favourite restaurant in Montreal and I have been here countless times with different people who all grow to love it as well.   If you love foie gras and meat, this is the place for you. They have so many foie gras options, it's insane. The naked foie gras is a classic pan seared foie gras in a red wine sauce. I love that they have very original options too such as the foie gras nigiri, foie gras cheung fun - if you're Chinese, it's exactly as it sounds with the rice noodle wrapped around foie gras with a soy sauce... super light tasting, very amazing. The foie gras poutine is mind-blowing and you must try it.   Every time you visit they will have specials that are based on fresh seasonal ingredients.   Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Excellent comfort food - friendly service - overhyped IMHO, and definitely too noisy when busy, which I believe means: it's constantly too noisy."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Montreal.  Imaginative.  Daring.  A true gastronomic adventure!  Highly recommended.  Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon is one of Montreals finest dining establishments! Inspired to visit by an episode of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations, my husband stopped in while in Montreal for a business trip. He raved about the food so much that on his next trip, I joined him and we had reservations for our final night in town. Too eager to wait, we went twice on our trip.   DAY 1: We had tarragon bison tongue, followed by their famous trotter, a deep fried pigs leg stuffed with veggies served on a bed of cheese infused mashed potatoes the consistency of cheese pizza, topped with foie gras. It was amazing!  DAY 2: Hungry for more we went BACK to AuPied for dinner and had some more amazing food- the highlight being foie gras cromquisse (spelling) - which was a foie gras stuffed hush puppie/fritter that was deep fried. You had to eat it in one bite and all the liquified foie gras came squirting out. We followed that with their beet/goat cheese salad which could have been a dessert, and it was so rich and so gorgeously presented. (it had beautiful greens and even a little lavender flower bud and then drizzled along side was beet puree.) Obviously our entrees were just as good, he had the PDC meatloaf and I had the PDC Melting Pot a porktastic selection of different meats on top of a bowl of the famous mashed potatoes.   We each had a glass of wine, then went ahead and ordered a $67 bottle of Cote du Rhone, our three apps, two entrees and dessert, the bill came out to about $160. Unfreakingbelievable! - considering the quality of the food.  Thanks Anthony Bourdain for being right on the money about this place and thanks Au Pied de Cochon for existing in the first place!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine poutine being better. Literally addictive.  Ordered the bone marrow with truffle, stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras, and the veal shank that was a special. These entrees are huge, good enough for 2-3 people. Everything tasted incredible, but so rich you won't be able to eat much before feeling full and salted out.   A must for Montreal."}
{"text":"My wife and my best friend were both visiting me in Montreal at the same time and this was the place I knew we had to go.  We'd all heard about it and it was going to be our 'special meal.'  Unfortunately, Au Pied de Cochon was just blah.  We started with cocktails.  A Manhattan, Lemon Slush, and a Raspberry Mojito were ordered and tasted.  The service was cool for the slush because they bring you the vodka in a little tea pot to add as you want.  The Raspberry Mojito was refreshing and definitely the most attractive drink on the table.  Cocktails = 4.5/5  Our appetizer was the \"Salade de Croustillant de PDC\" which we were sold on because of the 'crispy pork belly.'  Unfortunately, it was pork belly in some sort of breading, which didn't have much taste to it.  The salad itself was 'meh.' 2/5  We shared Duck in a Can (1/5) and Foie Gras Poutine (4/5) as the main courses for between the three of us.  The presentation of the Duck in a Can was really cool, I like the art on the can and I like that they open it up in front of you. Unfortunately, the contents of the can didn't taste as good as the can looked.  This was the worst dish of the night.  The duck breast was just ok, the skin was chewy and not at all appetizing (and I love me some duck skin), the rest of the dish was extremely salty. If it had one more grain of salt on it, it would have clearly been too much and I'd have sent it back.  Foie Gras Poutine somewhat lived up to its reputation and I would maybe recommend just grabbing a couple $5 beers and sharing a Poutine for those dead set on hitting this place up.  The foie gras really tasted good on and the gravy had good flavor.  We decided against dessert, not because we were full, but because the meal just wasn't that good and the dessert menu was full of boring stuff.    I'm ready to pay for a good meal, but this wasn't even a mediocre meal.  Au Pied didn't live up to its reputation at all and I wouldn't recommend that anyone go.    The next night, we tried for round 2 on the nice meal and had much success at O'Thym (which is also Apportez Votre Vin).  Take your APC dollars there."}
{"text":"Excellent food, outstanding service ( MC was nice and welcoming, really helpful with the menu). Great place for a date, a lot of dishes can be shared, but get everything! You definitely don't want to miss the Canned Duck!"}
{"text":"We called for reservations for a party of three which we were declined! Fortunately, I was able to convince the person stating we came to Montreal all the way from NYC just for this restaurant. Score! So now that we were in the doors we came with high expectations. C'mon, Bourdain almost had an orgasm from this place! We started with the usual, beer & oysters. I enjoy my oysters raw and unseasoned but these were great! We also ordered the Duck in a Can, Cromesquis Foie Gras, Cochonnailles Platter, PDC's Melting Pot, and Creme Brulee. The Cromesquis were delightful, warm and bursting with foe gras. I wouldn't recommend the Cochonnailles  platter, which was a cold plate of cured meats and blood. The Melting Pot was probably my favorite dish for its wholesome home flavor. Everything was overall solid but this wasn't my favorite dining experience as stated by others."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous. Ridiculously amazing. So much fun and such amazing food. The quality and uniqueness of the food is something that every foodie should experience. Go and be ready to be transported to a fantasyland of over-the-top cuisine in a fun, casual, north woods country environment. Don't go for a fancy, uppity, bourgeois night. Leave your pretensions at home and let yourself experience a gastronomic experience unlike any other. And don't go overboard too fast - get the take home containers and use them since you will be uncomfortably full if you try to eat everything you want to."}
{"text":"What an exceptional evening. We were in town for the F1 GP. This was a priority stop for us. We made reservations 3 months in advance.   The food is everything that everyone says. Exceptional! What made our evening so special was the attentive and personal service we received. Our server was exceptional! I only wish I could remember her name! At the end of the evening we were thanking her for such a wonderful experience and that's when she revealed that it was only her second shift as a server. That you for making our evening so special"}
{"text":"A fantastic dining experience throughout!  Went there on a Sunday evening without reservations.  Was a little hesitant that we would get a table, but we got there early enough (~6 PM) that we managed to get one.  The windows were all open, so the restaurant had a very airy feel.  The wait staff was super nice and friendly!  Our waiter was informative to tell us what wine to pair with our food and explained the dishes quite well to us.  The other waitresses were quick to serve us bread and water.  Truly pleasant!  Even if the wait staff were not friendly, the food would still get me 5 stars.  We had a dry sherry to begin our meal.  I don't remember the name of the sherry, but it was nice and nutty.  Then we had a red burgundy to go with our entire meal as the waiter recommended it to us.  That was absolutely divine!  Very easy to drink that I could have had 3 glasses of that without any complaints!  We started with tarragon bison tongue (omg, my first time!) and oysters as appetizers.  Can't say I've had enough bison tongue to distinguish whether it's good or not, but it was tasty enough that I didn't gag upon eating it.  But I know my seafood, and the oysters were delicious!  We proceeded with our entrees: catch of the day (hake), plogue Ã  champlain (potatoes, cheddar cheese, smoked bacon, maple syrup, seared foie gras, in a buckwheat flour crepe), and pied de cochon.  I absolutely loved the hake.  It was so fresh to eat!  The plogue was sweet, but that didn't bother me.  Au pied de cochon was fine (not a pig lover).  I'm normally not a fan of foie gras, but this place might actually make me like it.  Finally, for dessert, we had creme brulee and the panna cotta special.  Had better creme brulee as it was cold when we got it.  Panna cotta was light and easy to eat.  This was an expensive meal ($240 CSD for 3 people), but it was definitely a great dining experience.  I would go back again (well, when my wallet is a little bigger...)."}
{"text":"Au Pied du Cochon was fantastic. The foie gras terrine was the stand out dish, though we also enjoyed the foie gras croquettes, poutine, and milkshake. This was the perfect amount of food (with beer and wine) for two people, though our menu choices were skewed as Californians living under a foie gras ban.   The most outstanding aspect of our evening turned out to be the service. Our evening had been almost instantly ruined. When I sat down and went to check in on my phone, I discovered that my iPhone was missing. Our waiter offered me his cell phone to place an international call to my phone which had been found in the snow up the street. The waiter notified the hostess and I had my phone back by the second course. No matter how large the tip, I can't thank this young man enough for saving my Christmas vacation. We will be back next year."}
{"text":"Upon learning that Au Pied de Cochon likes to inject foie gras into everything from poutine to pancakes, I knew I had to give these people some business.  One of my friends scored us reservations at the bar which adjoins an entirely open kitchen where Chef Martin Picard and his capable cadre of culinary alchemists created their inimitable dishes mere feet away from us.  Picard is hands-on and oversees or participates in every aspect of the food preparation, all while getting wasted in plain view of his customers. Watching Picard chug an Irish Car Bomb, two glasses of wine, and three pints of beer in the two hours I was there was unreal. By the time I left, the dude's body was rocking back and forth and one of his eyes was permanently closed. It was awesome, they should give him a reality TV show.  I began the meal with the bison tongue appetizer, tender strips of meat prepared with tarragon. The meat itself was sweet and had a powerful and distinct flavor.  My dining partner ordered the venison tartare, which she let me taste. Nicely seasoned with capers, shallots, lemon, and a hint of capsicum, it was probably the most delicate and lean of all of the food that I sampled.  My entrÃ©e, however, was a unique and innovative achievement of culinary gluttony -- \"Canard en Conserve,\" or \"Duck in a Can.\" Duck in a Can is half a duck magret with a hunk of foie gras tucked under the skin, buttered cabbage, bacon, roasted garlic, two sprigs of thyme, and venison demi-glace, sealed and cooked in a can.  The can was opened by the server in front of me and dumped over toast covered with celery root puree. Yes, it tastes as insane and rich as it sounds.  My duck magret was not the only tantalizing piece of meat at Au Pied de Cochon; prep-cook Emily's derriere thrilled as she calmly executed Picard's grand scheme -- such a full, wonderfully shaped backside for a white woman that I slurred on about it ad nauseum, even as my friend's eyes rolled each time I did so.  Emily and all of the kitchen staff were friendly, occasionally stopping in-between chopping vegetables to ask how we were enjoying our meals, or to answer our questions about dishes they were working on.  The only negative thing I can say about this place is its lack of quality single-malt scotch, but this appears to be a systemic problem throughout MontrÃ©al. I happily settled with a Macallan 18, which went well with the Pouding ChÃ´meur dessert, literally translated as a poor man's pudding. This resembled a bread pudding made with a maple syrup custard and sponge cake.  I look forward to returning to Au Pied de Cochon on future visits to the city. I'd recommend this experience to anyone who loves food, and would also suggest that you try to score a bar seat reservation so you can watch Chef Picard get piss drunk in front of you."}
{"text":"As Advertised!!!  AWESOME!!!!  I suggest getting a mid-late service reservation at the bar. Keep your fingers crossed that you get one of the first six spots at the bar. The open kitchen is the most entertaining 120 minutes to come out of Montreal since Cirque du Soleil. This is dinner as theater at its very best. We laughed, we cried, we ate liquified fois gras.    The Plogue a Champlain...(don't ask, just order it... trust me) goes straight to my list of all time favorite dinner entrees. The wine list was well above the curve as far as Montreal resto's are concerned. Service was great ( though the hostess did seem a little perturbed we arrived 10 minutes early for a 9:30 PM reservation).  Au Pied du Cochon is the BOMB!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Went to Montreal for the first time and really wanted to go here for dinner. I made reservations long ago and this place did not disappoint. My husband got the duck in a can, which was delicious, and I got the stuffed pig's foot... Out of this world. Probably one of my favorite meals ever. The staff were all very friendly to us and we had a lovely time. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Much like prom night as a teen boy, Au pied is one of those things you fantasize about long before you ever experience it. Also much like prom night, it ends up being a bit of a let down. Not because you built it up so much in your head that it couldn't possibly measure up, but because no matter how good an effort is made, it'll still end up awkward.  I wanted to love Au pied, I really did. The space was very cool, the setting intimate and service exemplary. The food, however, felt like it was trying hard... too hard... to be different. I can appreciate a chef taking chances, or making their own way, but dinner here was more like being a guinea pig in a mad scientist's experiment than it was being along for a culinary journey with a genius. Black bean sauce on a seafood platter? Ehh, not feeling it.  Make no mistake, everything was good. They are doing some interesting things with quality ingredients and for the most part, they're successful. What they aren't doing is blowing me away with every course... or even really convincing me that I have to go back. In a city that kicks most other cities' asses in the food department, there are better options.  As a side note, we did get to see what I'm convinced is the largest lobster to ever be captured. It was ordered by a table next to us, had to be carried by two men on a large wooden platter and was clearly inspiration for a few sci-fi flicks. Think I'm full of ish? Check the pic below. See? Massive! (That's what she said.)  Super mutant lobster: http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg?select=V6jWNIwBBnP7NR0Q7_VP_A"}
{"text":"Montreal gluttony at it's finest.  We ordered the Foie terrine, bison tongue, duck in can, pig pot..  It's LOUD in here."}
{"text":"I've waited 6 years to eat here. I learned about this place from Anthony Bourdain and I've been dreaming of gorging myself since then.  The reservation system has to change, calling back and forth, I miss you, you miss me, it would all be worth it in the long run if....they didn't lose our reservation for a busy perfectly sunny and comfortable Friday night at 7:30pm. The person at the front said she would 'see what she could do' which is almost as infuriating as saying 'calm down buddy.' She saw what she could do and sat us at a 2 top closest to the door, which I thought would suck, but then I realized sitting in the back of the restaurant must have been awful because the restaurant was packed. Anyway...  Our server was wacky as hell and rushing around for the from table to table, the 2.5 hours we were there, he still took the time to explain everything to every table.  The liver salad, lovely dressing, light flavors, the liver was just irony enough, really great. The Foie Gras Grilled Cheese was perverse, greasy, rich, so flavorful, the bread just soaked up all the goodness. The Duck in a Can is clever, the duck is so well done, really meaty and rich, the extra foie gras tied it all together, it's a good portion for sharing. The key lime pie had a remarkable crust, buttery and rich, enough lime to cut that. Great wine selection, especially by the glass.  The food is decadent and rich, the prices are not bad when you really look at what you're getting. I liked it...alot"}
{"text":"Fantastic. This was my second trip to PDC and both have been really enjoyable dining experiences. The staff are really pleasant and work hard to create a memorable meal for the diners. I had the foie gras burger, poutine, and maple pie.   The burger was incredible. Between the foie gras, the cheese, the bacon, and beef there was a lot of fat here, this is a compliment. Definitely worth the $$ there isnt really another burger out there like it. The poutine had a really nice pepper gravy with excellent curds. Very happy with my choice but I also tried the duck in a can and the hot chicken. Both were equally as amazing, I just can't pass up foie gras on a burger. Finally, the maple pie was awesome. Really nice buttery, flaky crust with a rich maple filling. Summary: there is a reason why this restaurant is so popular, it's really good."}
{"text":"I really mean to give PdC 4.75 stars but only because I went to Joe Beef the night after so I had a good comparison. Gluttony is my middle name and I can usually handle everything, but I woke up feeling nauseous because things were settling weird after PdC. Granted, I shouldn't have stuffed myself with all things fat and cream in one sitting...  With that said, everything was really good, though again, really heavy with rich sauces and fat. We even ordered a salad, which didn't help, because there were cubes of fried pork in it. Now I understand why the French drink wine with their food. It definitely helps to cut the heaviness.  Cromequis de foie gras (foie gras cromesquis) - Amazing! You let it cool for a bit so you don't burn your mouth, pop it in, bite down, and let the flavors explode. It's awesome. My friend had a bad experience with foie gras because it was grainy and we had to explain that foie is supposed to be smooth. She tried this and was converted.  Langue de bison a l'estragon (tarragon bison tongue) - Another amazing app. The tongue is tender and flavors worked in unison. Plus, there were bits of carrots so yay for veggies.  Carpaccio de canard (duck carpaccio) - I liked it, but my friends didn't think it stood up next to the other two apps. It was mild in flavor and I didn't care for the cheese shavings on top, but the carpaccio itself with good and fresh.  Poutine au foie gras (foie gras poutine) - we ordered a half size because we had a lot of food coming. Fries were good and crunchy and gravy was poured over it. Sitting on top of the gravy was a huge chunk of foie. Overall delicious, but we're glad we didn't order the full serving.  Special of the day: Calamari and fries in squid ink sauce - I guess when the server mentioned the special all we heard was calamari and squid ink sauce because we didn't know it came with fries. I think there were more fries than calamari, possibly half and half, and the sauce was decadent and thick. There were also gold flakes sprinkled on top which were pretty cool. Good dish nonetheless, and quite different from what I've experienced at other restaurants.  Special of the day: Salad with pork - I forgot what kind of salad the server said this was, but it came with a lot of cubed pork on top of two or three pieces of lettuce and arugula. On the side were two rounds of bread with chevre spread onto it. Probably can skip.  Duck in a Can - get this! Sooo good! Don't even ask questions, just do it.  Ordered some more dishes... but I don't remember what they were at this point. I need a return visit to remember."}
{"text":"Wowww, this place ROCKED my WORLD & taste buds and now I can truly say I have had Great & Authentic French food.  I was lucky that my server, Alex, pampered & SPOILED me with her expertise.  I had told her that I'm from LA where Foie Gras is unjustifiably banned because we foolishly care more about animals & pets than other poor & starving human beings and, thus, I had to have my taste buds ROCKED by foie gras and Alex succeeded with: 1) foie gras cromesquis & 2) guedille lobster sandwich with foie gras.  Thank u sooooo much Alex and Au Pied De Cochon for a memorable dinner!!!"}
{"text":"My bf and myself are big fan of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations follower. After watching the Montreal episode of No Reservations, we decide to drive up to Au pied de cochon from NYC. It was very very hard to get table reservation, so we decide to walk in see if we can get lucky. And...YES! we are very lucky to show up 5pm hungry for some good food and there boom 2 bar seat available, of course no question we took the spot and start drinking while we check out the menu...Yes, the duck in the can is fun, the menu descriptions and dish names are playful. This is serious food and seriously amazing, and fun. Things not to miss include the foie gras tart, the boidin noir, and baked apple. The PDC mashed potatoes are half potato, half cheese, and that is a beautiful thing. The draft cider is also quite refreshing, and the wine list is relaxed and affordable.  Bon Appetit!!"}
{"text":"For months after having dinner at Au Pied de Cochon I tried to find any reason I could to get back to Montreal to go there again and I will do it.  This place is unbelievably good. There are multiple preperations of fois gras, outrageous appetizers and main courses that you just wish you have more of. The \"Duck in a Can\" and all the pork dishes especially the pigs feet (pied) are a must.  If you don't live in Montreal try to go with as many people as you can so you can order the whole menu and split it all. We left at 10:00 pm and there was still a line to get a table. Reservations are a must escpecially for us out of towners.    This is a casual wood table and chairs place with a madman at the helm!!!  I will find a way to get back to Au Pied de Cochon before I die..."}
{"text":"Was it extravagantly rich? Yes. Did we drink too much wine? Yes. Would I go back again? Yes. In a heartbeat.   APDC was the highlight of my trip to Montreal. From the amuse of little fried croquettes of foie to the still bubbling maple pudding we had for dessert, every moment was rich, smokey, porky, and delicious.   Along with the food, service was great. I don't remember our server's name, but she was enthusiastic, didn't try to oversell us, and incredibly helpful as we tried to put together the perfect meal. She helped pick out a delightful bottle of wine as well. Light and bright, it cut through the richness of our meal perfectly. Her recommendation of a calvados to sip at the end of the evening was exactly what we needed.   Would we have eaten more? Yes. Absolutely, but I didn't bring any pants with a waistband stretchy enough to handle the amount of dishes I only wished I could have tried. Montreal you were beautiful APDC, you were bewitching with your luxurious ways. I will be back."}
{"text":"So walked in at 5:30 on a last Sunday of the year that they were going to be open. Needles to say madness !!!! Our reservations were lost however the hostess was exceptionally good at getting us a table without any fuss. Once seated we were warmly greeted by waiter... our new friend for the night lol! He was not only extremely well spoken in English but also very patient taking his time explaining each and every dish multiple times even though there was a line out the door. We started with awesome Cocktails c'mon who can pass up a poached pear in maple syrup yummines! We then went on to the marrow with beluga caviar and fresh bread , and foie gras pasta almost like a ravioli.... IT WAS PURE ART! Then onto the main course which was out of this world ! Cassoulet was made to perfection! I must say if one watches Anthony Bourdain you will know what I mean when I say we had a Bourdain moment of meat sweats shots more meat sweat more shots followed by beer and dessert but most of all awesome service from the wait staff who drank with us and laughed to no end.  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is located a short 20 minute Metro ride northwest of Downtown Montreal. It's a bit of a walk from the metro station but WELL WORTH IT! First of all, they have quite a large menu of items. It might not be listed on the menu, but our waiter read out at least 20-25 more items that I just couldn't repeat even on my best days of memorization.  It's a nice casual restaurant that gets very crowded during dinner time so make sure to make reservations as we did. Once inside, you will notice the kitchen area which is manned by quite a few people. Another observation was that all the waiters were men who were probably less than 30 years old, not that there's anything wrong with it. Once seated, we ordered one of the foie gras'. I'm not a huge fan of liver so I didn't like it, but from what I was eating if someone did like it, I think it would taste good to them.  For the entree, I ordered the Breast with mushrooms and it was AMAZING. The breast was juicy, soft and the meat was just sizzling in my mouth with flavors. There was a dark, but not heavy, sauce on the plate mixed with the mushrooms which complemented the breast very well. The dish was also quite hefty.   The only disappointment I had was that when the restaurant got crowded, the service was a tad slower because all the waiters were running around trying to appease new customers walking in. We waited for the check for at least a good 20 minutes before we could get our waiters attention to bring it, which then resulted in another 15 minute wait for him to bring it. He was a good waiter though in that he gave us good recommendations, read out all the non-menu items very clearly and was very accommodating knowing we were from America. Just wish he knew to pay a little more attention to all his customers and not just new tables."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Montreal The Halibut was to die for, their wine menu was remarkable and the waiter gave us a detailed description of every item in the menu. I will miss Montreal just because of this place."}
{"text":"Must make reservations and a must try while in Montreal. Heard Anthony Bourdain was here for one of his episodes, and I'm glad I tried this. I love foie gras and theres a huge menu of foie gras items. Definitely order a few small items to share and an entree.  1. Foie Gras Cromesquis - two small croquette's filled with foie gras. Eat it all in one bite and it bursts.  2. Duck Carpaccio - meat is very soft, loved it. 3. Foie gras poutine - The gravy was so good, it was probably the best poutine dishes I've tried while visiting. They can do half orders too! 4. Duck Magret in Mushroom Sauce - only ordered this because they were out of the Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras =(   Creme Brulee was good, but they burned the top. Overall great experience, but would of loved to have tried more items."}
{"text":"So many other good reviews that seem very accurate. Make your reservations, loosen your belt and enjoy!!   As this was my first visit, I had Duck in a Can. It was good. It was also a popular dish that evening. My partner had the Pied de Cochon. Also quite good. However, my appetizer was a personal favorite. The Guinea Hen Liver Mousse was simply spectacular. Served in a jar with crispy bread and a cornichon, it's a fun presentation (much like the Duck in a Can) and this dish really pleases the palate. I had to slow myself down to enjoy each and every bite. It just tasted TOO good to eat quickly. Order this app and you'll be left wanting to lick the inside of the jar clean...or at least use your fingers to savor every last morsel..."}
{"text":"It's all about the foie, this place, although one shouldn't overlook the other parts of the menu.  With all the reviews on yelp and otherwise, you pretty much get a sense that this place is popular, expensive, and appeals to foodies and bourgeois alike.  I won't say too much more about it except what I had and what I thought about it:  Starter: battered and fried zucchini blossoms (served in a paper cone with homemade mayonnaise)--served hot, so greasy (ergo, the paper cone) the mayo doesn't stick to the batter!  But tasty.  Thumbs up up.  Appetizer:  Seared scallops with some sauteed greens and a dijon aioli--a little firm, but not over-cooked. Thumbs wagging.  Main: duck in a can (ie, duck breast with a piece of foie and chopped celery and carrot slow cooked in a tin can and dumped on a piece of toast tableside)--this is a \"classic\" dish, and if classic meaning old, it sure is that.  As in, overrated.  Somewhat offputting is that the dish is served warm, not hot.  I know because I watched my can sit on the server's rack waiting to be picked up for about twenty minutes (not heat lamp, mind you).  Which made the piece of duck fat (larger than either the breast itself and the piece of foie) initmidating.  Chewy too, which comes from not being rendered from being heated in a sealed can.  But it's a classic, so order it by all means.  I'm not a fan, thumbs down.  Dessert: fruit pudding (er, rather, diced pear and berries in a gratin dish baked with a piece of pastry)--yikes, talk about over-sweet.  Thumbs down down.  Beer: six on tap, glasses chilled.  Thumbs up.  Wines: by the glass, about six options for red and the same for white.  Thumbs up.  Espesso: hey, it's an espresso, if you screw that up, you're not even on my radar.  Thumbs up.  Two more points: singletons get to sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen, which was great.  I wasn't bored for a second and the cooking crew genuinely seem to enjoy themselves.  Also, I was a bit annoyed that the host was not so subtle in recommending the heaviest and most expensive item from each part of the menu.  Now, as an economist would tell you, price is a valuable (ha) piece of information in conveying quality or demand relative to supply, but come on, a slight guy like me does not need to have seven courses (I didn't, obviously).  Unless you want me sick, which hopefully wasn't the idea.  So, on average, a decent dining experience, but not transformative, not revelatory.  I'd go back for some things on the menu and because the ambience is great, but the best restaurant in Montreal is too high a claim from me."}
{"text":"Got there at 9 pm. Unfortunately they were out of the following: no hot chicken, no tomato tart, no zucchini blossoms, no pork special. We waited 45 min for the fish quenelles - which were delicious. Then waited 30 min for the fried sturgeon - boring. The manager apologized. I guess if you want to eat pigs brains, or pay $44 for duck in a can, this is your place. Could have done much better food in Montreal."}
{"text":"After hearing about how good this place is we had to check it out for ourselves.  It did not disappoint.  Everything we had was delicious and surprisingly it was moderately priced.  The vibe in this place is pretty cool....  Even the cooks had a beer in hand. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is a definite place to visit while in Montreal. Plan to linger at your table after a meal here. The food is so amazingly rich with outstanding flavor. I have never quite had anything like this cusine before. We enjoyed Tomatoe Tartlet and beef tartare for our appetizer. I enjoyed the Nova Scotia swordfish with artichoke hearts. Ramzi enjoyed the foie gras poutine. Poutine is a dish consisting of french fries, cheese curds, brown gravy, and topped with other ingredients. In Ramzi's case, he chose to top the poutine with Foir Gras. The restaurant has a bustling feel but still quaint enough to feel relaxed. Service took a bit long, but the service staff still very friendly."}
{"text":"Not to say it wasn't good...just to good enough for 2 weeks ahead reservation and steep price!  I went there a few years ago and remembered that I wasn't wowed by the food...but going there last weekend for a friend's birthday confirmed that it definitely wasn't worth it.  When you pay $36 for a tuna belly entree, you would expect that they put more than 4 slices as thin as paper around rice...I mean at least get the rice part right. If you are not a sushi restaurant, then don't serve Japanese dishes if you can't get the basics right!  There wasn't one single dish that was memorable as they most likely tasted very similar.  The dishes are very filling as they are heavy so you need to share your dish...I would say order 2 mains for 3 people.  I have also been to their sugar shack many times and only the first time was good...  Take my word for it...you won't be blown away so spend your money elsewhere...unless money is no issue and you want to try it since it is so well known."}
{"text":"Je ne connaissais pas Yelp Ã  l'Ã©poque mais je ne peux que laisser un petit mot concernant ce resto qui m'a laissÃ© un souvenir impÃ©rissable ! C'Ã©tait il y a 4 ans et c'est le premier resto qui m'a fait papillonner de plaisir. On a eu droit Ã  une mise en bouche de fleur de courgette farcie et frite avec une petite mayo maison. Moi qui ne mangeait jamais de mayo jusque lÃ , j'ai fini le pot avec les doigts, c'est dire ! Ensuite est arrivÃ©e la plogue Ã  Champlain avec du foie gras, du vieux cheddar bien Ã©pais, bien fondant, des pommes caramÃ©lisÃ©es et du bacon croustillant, savoureux, juteux et moelleux Ã  la fois, divinissime ! Pour le plat, nous avions commandÃ© deux grands plateaux de fruits de mer ; des huitres, du homard, des pinces de crabes Ã  carapace molle en tempura, des escargot de mer, du crabe des neiges... Le crabe Ã  carapace molle, j'en rÃªve encore ! Et encore une fois, ils ont rÃ©ussi lÃ  oÃ¹ d'autres avaient Ã©chouÃ© ; me faire manger des huitres crues, simplement parce qu'elles sont prÃ©parÃ©es Ã  merveille et d'une fraÃ®cheur exceptionnelle. Alors oui, les prix sont un peu Ã©levÃ©s mais qu'est ce que Ã§a les vaut !!! N'hÃ©sitez pas Ã  rÃ©server si vous passez par lÃ  !"}
{"text":"I've visited Montreal 5 times and wanted to try this place every time, finally got a reservation and did it right before Christmas 2012.  We sat at the bar, which was great because the bartender/server was funny and whipped up some creative and awesome non-alcoholic drinks for me.  For food we got: bison tongue horse tartare foie gras tart (I didn't try this since I'm not a fan of foie gras) Special pig's foot stew  Loved every bite of food even though the dishes were heavy.  I do recommend this restaurant to everyone who visits Montreal."}
{"text":"To be clear- you're coming here for fois-gras and a delicious but heavy meal. Food was off-the-chain and the service was on point!  The owner hovers around and makes sure everyone is happy and if you're not he'll make you happy, either with his luscious beard or free offerings. We got both.  Highly recommended for folks passing through Montreal."}
{"text":"A few nights ago my boyfriend and I celebrated his 32nd birthday at this very hip and extremely popular restaurant in the \"happening\" Plateau neighborhood of MontrÃ©al. The \"Au Pied de Cochon\" restaurant is famous throughout the QuÃ©bec province (if you visit MontrÃ©al or live in MontrÃ©al, it would be an absolute shame not to come here at least once). Martin Picard's small restaurant is one of the very few restaurants that serves strictly gourmet QuÃ©bÃ©coise food. The restaurant's deserved reputation and celebrity comes by way of mouth as much as by the popular cooking show (en franÃ§ais, mais oui!) hosted by Martin Picard himself. Martin Picard is heralded by his legions of fans for successfully turning traditionally working class grub into world-class cuisine. The delightful fare includes venison, Poutine au foie gras, canard en conserve (incredible!!!) and (my favorite) pouding chÃ´meur. At the end of the meal we both wondered aloud if there was nary a duck anywhere in the world who still possessed his liver as only our imported French wine and desserts did not boast a bit of foie gras. But don't confuse our observation with a complaint as we would not want it any other way! Surprisingly the ambiance is quite romantic despite the noisy and crowded atmosphere. By all means, go(!!!)... and don't forget to make a reservation and most importantly, bring a defibrillator and fast like Mahatma Gandhi before your arrival. Bon appÃ©tit!"}
{"text":"What a great dining experience. I brought a date here on Valentine's day and the place was everything I expected and more. The Bison Ribs were incredible, and the house ale couldn't have been finer. I recommend it to anybody who is in Montreal and wants to have a world-class dining experience."}
{"text":"For my boyfriend and my final dinner in Montreal, we made reservations at Au Pied de Cochon.  We were greeted by a friendly waiter and he went through the specials with us (there were a lot of specials). He described the cold lobster soup ($12) so well, I decided to go with it. We also got oysters (6 for $18) because I love raw oysters. Lastly, we had to get au pied de cohon au foie gras ($45). The waiter was nice enough to tell us that hte au pied de cochon will be enough for the two us and that we shouldn't order any other mains. They also offered us freshly baked bread as we waited for our appetizers and main meal.  When we got the cold lobster soup, we were surprised because we didn't hear the waiter mentioning that it was cold. It was quite salty and I didn't catch any lobster flavour in the soup at all.  When the oysters came, I was super excited until I saw the size of it. It was quite small considering it was $3 a piece. I could get the same size oyster for cheaper ($1 a piece) at Biff's Bistro in Toronto during their happy hour. Nonetheless, the oysters were delicious and the sauce that it came with went wonderfully together.  Lastly was our main meal which took 30 minutes of wait time after finishing our appetizers. The meat fell off the pig's foot. The sauce over the mushrooms was so good. The best part was the mashed potato with cheese melted into it. This restaurant really lived up to its hype on this dish.  However, our night sadly went downhill because the waiter was nowhere to be seen. We wanted to see the dessert menu to possibly order more food. However, every time we see him, he'll finish talking to another customer and then walk the opposite direction from where we were sitting. Finally, we decided to get the bill. We finally flagged him down and he didn't get back to us at all. From the end of our main meal to trying to get the dessert menu to us trying to get the bill took over 30 minutes. In the end, it was another person (looks like the manger) who got us the bill.  I still give this place four stars. Although the waiter completely failed at serving our table, the food was awesome and the price point wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"This was one of the best restaurant experiences I have had in Montreal and if Yelp would let me, I'd give it 4.5 stars.   The first good sign was the serving of warm bread. Given the name, I was expecting only pork options on the menu but the selection turned out to be quite varied. There were 11 of us so I got to try lots of entrees (and the portions are made for sharing): lobster, hen, happy pork chop, and bison rib. All were very good but the rib was the table favorite. It fell completely off the bone and was covered in a sauce that had a perfect blend of tang and sweet. The sauteed spinach garnish that came with the rib was delicious and would have loved it as a side. The mashed potatoes were also a hit...just like your grandmother made 'em.  (I was not as impressed with the special mussels appetizer, and the duck carpaccio needed some acid so minus half a star.)  Too stuffed for dessert.    Topping it all off was the stellar service, and remember, we had 11 folks at the table. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"Really very good but due to having the best meal of my life 2 days earlier it didn't pull that 5 star. I was impressed they held out reservation after being 20 min late but they made up for it when we, and both tables in either side of us I noticed, waited 20 min for them to take payment. Waitress choose a great bottle of wine for us $60, foie gras poutine was rich and good size as was the melting pot- don't fear the blood sausage! The French onion soup was amazingly perfect and the apple blue cheese salad was a good size too! Fun staff and busy busy busy. No room for strollers, or wheelchairs I can't imagine..."}
{"text":"everything is waaaay to rich. we got the duck in the can, the platter appetizer, the melting pot (i believe thats what its called), and one other dish that i think included venison or bison.  the duck meat was good i have to say, but too fatty for me. at the end of the night, everyone at my table agreed one word to describe the food here is: RICH.   on the other hand, the atmosphere is definitely fun. i'd recommend everyone to visit this place at least once. for me, once is enough."}
{"text":"We were told by a few folks from the area to make a reservation here weeks in advance, and glad we did so. The food was quite good and it was very busy. Service was a bit slow, and the place is expensive but you should come here and check it out.  We got a charcuterie platter, the tuna tartar special, and duck in a can. The tuna was awesome, charcuterie was great, and the duck was amazing. We didn't love the pig brain but everything else on the platter was delicious. The duck was great, that is a must if you come here. And they serve hot bread which is quite tasty.  Worth making a reservation well in advance."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Au Pied de Cochon due to the reviews and also seeing it several times on the Travel Channel. First off let me say that parking is a hassle in this area, my husband drove around for 30 minutes before finding a spot. I realize that this isn't a reflection of the food and service, just something to watch out for. We arrived at 7 PM with no wait time! That was a big plus due the fact that it was packed. I ordered the Poutine au Foie Gras. It was extremely rich and heavy. I did enjoy it but it definitely was not worth the $24. My husband ordered the Melting Pot. It was filled with different sausages, mushrooms, and potatoes. He said it was good but he wished he knew what kind of sausages he was eating, as our waitress did not explain the dish very well. She was extremely scripted and made us feel rushed while ordering. The meal was around $100 for two. Overall, I am pleased we made the decision to try this place out but I probably would not consider it again."}
{"text":"After waiting to eat at this restaurant for over six years, I'd love to report it was worth the wait. Unfortunately, the main portion of our dinner is still missing in the kitchen somewhere, probably between the air conditioner that constantly dripped on my head and the screaming kids of one of the senior staff/owner. There comes a point where you have to cut your losses and just walk out on something you've lost your appetite for rather than drop some serious coin for a meal you've been waiting for over an hour and a half for and could no longer stomach.  I'll be honest, what we had was good. Poutine side, really good. Endive salad, excellent. Duck pate appetizer, yummy. Their version of a whiskey sour was world class. Even the wine I was supposed to have with my entrÃ©e was an excellent choice, as it should be after breathing for so long. And I know it takes a long time to make good food - I've eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world and they know how to time things out of a kitchen so that you don't lose your appetite. They also know how to own up to their mistakes. And they know how to properly set the atmosphere of a restaurant, something they have clearly lost touch with here.  Let's start from the beginning. I tried to set a reservation through e-mail, which they said would be confirmed via a phone call. Never got the call. Yet when I finally called, they mysteriously confirmed the reservation via e-mail, yet I had never given it to them other than through the e-mail and in fact had reserved through another name. The only way they could have linked it up was via the phone numbers I gave, which matched.  Next, the music in the restaurant is so loud, everybody has to scream at each other to be heard, driving up the noise level even more and the very knowledgeable waiter can't be heard describing virtually any of the specials. Normal table conversation is practically impossible. Add in the fact we were sat underneath the air conditioning vents which were set so cold they accumulated condensation that periodically dripped on top of my head or down my face. Except when they came by with a squeegee to mop the ceiling, which bought me a few more minutes peace. Then ramp up the noise level with two kids related to the staff who were either running around the restaurant, crashing dishes together, or crying at the top of their lungs while mom tried to comfort them when they clearly didn't want to be there, and we're on a downhill slide.  Drinks arrived quickly, salads and appetizers seemed to be a bit slow, but hey, it's supposed to be quality, I can cut them some slack. Huge portions, you're advised to split everything unless you want a ton of doggie bag material, which is rather inconvenient if you aren't local. And then the wait started. Yes, the au pied de cochon takes 45 minutes, which they didn't warn us about, but an hour and a half after ordering it, it still hadn't arrived, I had lost my appetite for it, and my wife had had enough. We're were done. But apparently they weren't, as they proceeded to insult us by telling us it wasn't fast food and it took time to prepare. Yes, I know that, but when our waiter stopped making eye contact with us 45 minutes ago, perhaps you could have warned us that someone had screwed up and let us order something else rather than have it get worse and worse and worse. No, no, it's ready, stay, pay, and eat something you have no more stomach for, you ignorant American pigs. No apologies, nothing, but it practically took an Act of Parliament just to get our check so we could pay for what we ate and properly tip the staff, who had done no wrong.  As I said, I really looked forward to this, and my wife, who loves foie gras, had looked forward to it even more, but if Jon Taffer ever makes a series about successful restaurants who need a serious makeover because they've gotten too big a head, this should be at the top of his list."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Great wait staff. Only complaint was that it took a while for the bill to come. Waiter explained all the specials but pay attention because they're quite a handful to remember.  Lots of foie gras and truffle on the menu. If you're a fan of either, this is the place to be!  The bison tartare was delish! You pour the quail egg yolk onto the tartare & then bite into a savory melt-in-your-mouthful of bison tartare. It's like a sushi roll you'd wish to eat every time. The tartare is spiced and packed with flavor. And I have to admit the texture was great too - the chef had added some fried flakes onto the tartare to give it a bang.  We also got the squid special of the night. Imagine fried pieces of squid and calamari sitting on top of a pile of curd cheese and French fries. Then imagine a lovely thick savory black squid ink sauce poured over it and then typed with edible gold flakes. Amazingly delicious!  I got the bone marrow expecting it to be out of my mind. I was slightly disappointed because it wasn't full of flavor as I had expected. The vegetable puree, however, did have a lot of truffle in there.  Get the foie gras poutine. The foie gras was so buttery soft - it just literally melted in my mouth.  The duck in a can was amazing. Savory soft duck pieces and a piece of foie gras prepared so well, then resealed in a can. Imagine opening that can and seeing all that meat and gravy pouring onto a light pile of mash potatoes and a slice of buttery toasted baguette.  Do get the sugar pie!!! Amazing way to end the night. Lightly grainy maple sugar syrup filling topped with a light cream sitting on a flaky buttery crust. And to be accompanied by 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream on the side?! Hell yeah!!!  Ambience was loud but this place was poppin'! Great place to grab delicious grub with friends. DO come here. So worth the visit in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Call me old fashioned but  this restaurant is not for me. We love going to good restaurants. We  usually find something healthy in a menu, but here there's not one ( maybe the endive salad) menu that's not going to give you high cholesterol or clogged arteries. The place is packed and loud. I guess everybody loves this place. It is highly rated an was part of Eater Montreal. I will give three stars for the service, even its so busy the wait staff were attentive and nice. Actually my husband liked the poutine. The highly talked about \"duck in the can\" is overrated. Not a fan of it. Anyway, if you want to try this place, just be ready to walk home to walked off all the fat and calories."}
{"text":"French food at its best. There's a reason why tony bourdain did an episode on this place, the food kicks ass. Must try the Bison tongue! Foie gras, Poutine, and Rib. Be warned make reservations early, like three months in advance."}
{"text":"We came to celebrate my husband's birthday. We reserved via email. It's the easiest way. I highly recommend reserving this way.   I do not recommend going on Sunday's. They're out of everything. They were out of a few items. I didn't care for some, but being out of Ribs, Sweetbread, and BEER?! That was very disappointing.   I ended up getting the famous Duck in a Can. Great flavour. Very delicious. Duck cooked to perfection.   Then the Ragout. I liked the texture and how all the ingredients complimented each other, but it was wayyy too salty. I loved how it was prepared in a cheese block in front of us.   Our waitress was rude and short with everything. Uninformative. We felt very rushed by her. Pretty much everything sucked but the Duck in a Can. I will come back and perhaps the experience will be better to tie with the good food."}
{"text":"After viewing Au Pied and the chef/owner on Anthony Bourdain's \"No Reservations,\" my hubby and I chose to take a trip to Montreal with one main goal of dining at de Cochon. If you are a foodie, it is a MUST DO on your bucket list. Called before leaving the US to make reservations to sit at two of the five or so counter seats they have that overlooks the kitchen (were Tony sat). It was absolutely amazing to see how many fantastic plates were consistently handed out from such a tiny space. Watching the chefs true symphony of movements between one another was incredible.   The food, ahhhh the food. So rich, inventive, highest quality ingredients. Husband had a foie gras burger. Thought it would be a burger with a slice of foie on top. Nope, Whole \"patty\" was foie. I had the terrine. Cannot find the words to experience the flavors and textures, other than to boldly say an orgasm in my mouth.   Chatted with the chefs the whole time and even got to meet the owner/head chef toward the end of our meal. As a result we were offered several free tastings of other menu items including foie gras poutine and even little deep fried cubes of foie (yup, I know). (Another advantage of sitting at the bar.)   For the first and only time in my life I experienced a true \"food coma\" is. No amount of vodka or walking could resurrect my foodie spirit from the depths of foie overdose, but ya know what?...I would do it again tomorrow. Next time I think I'll try the \"duck in a can.\" Merci beaucoup!!!"}
{"text":"Au PIed de Cochon, ah!  Little piggy come here and let me kiss your delicious feet.  This was hands down our best meal in Montreal.  We came early without a reservation and were treated so beautifully by the host when mentioning how much we hoped to eat here, and swept right into a small three top.Bliss began when our food arrived.  Every dish was remarkable in some way, the best being the house pork chop covered in foie and served with soft potatoes.  I say this as someone who has never been properly impressed by a pork chop.  It was completely lush, rich and decadent. That pork chop was so delicious, its hard to do it justice with words.  Also terrific were their other dishes, from the fiddleheads, to the clever foie nigiri with peanut sauce (easier to drizzle than to dip), to the calamari pasta, to the crab salad with milk dressing (again, remarkably good), to the duck fat fries.  I am getting hungry again just thinking about our meal.  The best part is that the service here is warm and professional and completely up to the terrific food. This place is really special.  I think they had about ten foie dishes, which is pretty awesome right off the bat, let alone that everything they put in front of us was very, very tasty. The service and atmosphere here are delightful.   This little piggy can run all the way home, and into my mouth anytime."}
{"text":"Three of us ate dinner at Au Pied du Cochon.  The food was a novelty.  I'd call it country Quebecois food, with lots of use of fats, foie gras, and various kinds of meats.  We also had a tomato soup special offered that night which, of course, had foie gras in it as well as some kind of sausage.  It was quite good.  We liked the duck in a can with its generous portion of foie gras (100g, I think) and the medium rare duck meat.  One of us had the chicken entrÃ©e (pees, bread, and gravy) and did not care for it.   We had no room for dessert.  Our waiter helped to pick a nice red wine ($54, one of the least expensive bottles available).  Leave any notions of healthiness at the door and enjoy the decadence of a fat laden meal.  The restaurant itself was often too noisy for conversation, made worse by loud music.  The dÃ©cor was simple wood with horizontal mirrors.  The simple un-interesting dÃ©cor did not fit the cost or effort put into the food.  We enjoyed going for the novelty and the sense of a Quebecois experience but would not go again.  It is not a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Wow.  Amazing.  A meat lover's heaven.  The perfect spot to come to on a cold Canadian winter night.  come hungry and leave full."}
{"text":"Scored a reservation on the day-of, and enjoyed dinner at this much talked-about restaurant. For appetizers, we did the Fois Gras Cromesquis (liked it, but they were 2 small bites of fried balls with liquid fois gras), and the Cochonnailles Platter (good but not that memorable plate of pork products, including pate, sausages, etc). For entrees, we did duck in a can, and stuffed pied de cochon with foie gras. Duck in a can was good, but definitely enjoyed the pied de cochon better. Also had the creme brulee for dessert (okay). The dining experience was just okay, as earlier reviews noted - it took a while for us to get seated despite the reservation, and service was leisurely. Still, I give 4 stars for the foie gras decadence and for the pied de cochon dish we had."}
{"text":"Given all the hype surrounding this place, I was stoked to tuck into a gluttonous meal with my family and slowly waddle home satisfied and overstuffed with pork products but was frankly disappointed. Having made a reservation weeks in advance, we were disappointed to find our table stuck in the furthest darkest back corner of the restaurant underneath a freezing cold air vent. To start we ordered a charcuterie plate which was delicious with thin cuts of house-cured meats spectacularly draped over a pig's skull but the rest of the meal was kinda lousy. I ordered the infamous duck in a can with foie gras, thyme, and cabbage. The duck was tough, the foie gras gelatinous, and the overall dish just a one-note fat-flavoured slop. My boyfriend ordered the foie gras burger which he described as being just a very regular burger, the best thing about it being the in-season tomatoes on top. Our server also goaded him into getting an order of fries to accompany an already mammoth meal that no one ended up eating. My parents both ordered seasonal specials which they both enjoyed, but not enough to justify the price tag. Beyond that my Dad's dish arrived a good 10 minutes after everyone else's which made for a brief bit of awkwardness as we started our meal.   What was supposed to be the one fancy night out for my out-of-town parents ended up being a bit of a bummer. It feels like with all the fame that the restaurant has received they've become a bit uninspired when it comes to churning out their greatest hits but put more effort into their specials that allow for less gimmick and more culinary creativity. As predicted, I did end up waddling home with a full belly but ended up totally disappointed and would not recommend Au Pied de Cochon."}
{"text":"Ouff getting a reservation at au PdeC was not an easy task ... who still operates over voicemail? Especially over a voicemail box that is always full?! But au PdeC still seems to get away with it thanks to all the hype Anthony Bourdain created during his 24 hour Montreal layover (if you've never watched it: http://www.dailymotion.com/.../xo2kqf_the-layover-s01e06-mont...).  Needless to say, we had to try it out ourselves or we couldn't be called true Montrealers. But the overwhelming foie gras stuffed courses were too much for two people to handle, so we brought 2 friends for back up!   All in all, if you come knowing that this will not be a fine dining experience and that you WILL be overindulging in rich and heavy courses, then your experience will be a satisfying one.  And let's be honest, everything just tastes better with fat!  From the foie gras stuffed croquettes that just ooze in your mouth as you bite into them, to the decadent poutine topped with foie gras gravy and a whole piece of foie gras and then the squash risotto cooked in a whole wheel of parmesan...! Your reward center will be firing away happy signals for hours to come smile emoticon  All this goodness, paired with a nice bottle of french wine (they have an extensive french heavy wine list and some good beer on tap) made this a highly enjoyable 'tourist in your own city experience'.   Good food, good wine and great company along with a surprisingly affordable tab... what's not to like?"}
{"text":"I made a reservation and was told only bar seats were still available. Yet when I got to the restaurant a lot of tables were open. Sitting at the bar was uncomfortable. The waiters and barstaff are working, splashing water and ice around (sometimes it lands on you). Sometimes they forget and let out a swear and it just makes for a feeling like you're seated in the back of a kitchen. Highly unpleasant seating, would not recommend accepting anything less than a table out front. As the evening heats up waitstaff are constantly bumping you as they pass by, no matter how much you scooch in.   This place could have redeemed itself on the basis of good food. Alas. They are of the unfortunate school of restaurants who think more food = better. NO. More of mediocre food is just a lot of mediocre food. The PDC cut, for example, was raw in the middle and hard to saw through. You would think something named \"PDC cut\" would fall off the bone and be cooked all the way through. Alas.   The blood sausage tort was more of an enormous pizza with blood sausage chunks on top. It was very delicious, but the presentation was lacking, the portion much too enormous. The PDC house beer was a limp-wristed sparkling water rather than a beer.   I don't know, I wouldn't waste your time and money on this place when there are so many others to choose from. I was very disappointed with this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is deeeep in the French speaking cut of Montreal.  We walked in not one person was speaking English at any of the tables.  This is definitely not a tourist restaurant.  The food here is simply amazing and the menu changes all the time.  When we went, they had a bison steak frites that everyone at the table ordered.  The only downside is that the staff is a bit condescending, well they are quite a bit hipster-French-Canadian hipster.  That got old and is the only reason I did not give it more stars."}
{"text":"It is truly an unforgettable experience. Dress up to get tanatlized. Truly unique to quebec and many other places I have been to.  Here is where we send all the rock stars."}
{"text":"Some sweet lady from my hood arranged for the food truck to arrive on the last day of the local organic produce market. There is some kind of irony in that as I wouldn't associate the food of Au Pied de Cochon with organic and healthy, nor I would recommend it to vegeterians. Would I recommend it in general? Oh, yes! Must try!  It has been few years since I visited the actual restaurant and my memories of it were kind of blurry. The foie gras poutine of the food truck brought back immediately the flavours of that dinner. The size of the poutine is decent for a food truck as well as the size of the foie gras in it. What makes the dish unique is the foie gras gravy, it is just delicious. We also shared le verrat Ã  l'Ã©rable, battered pork sausage soaked in maple, which was really good and filling. The maple soda went well with the food. Conclusion I'm quite happy with my PDC truck experience and will do it again!"}
{"text":"Wow. Need I say more. Well I will. If you haven't understood from the other reviewers, this place is amazing. You must get reservations here as it is so popular, that it is always filled. We had reservations and still waited for almost an hour, but the wait was well worth it. If you are looking for a large sign to Au Pied De Cochon, then you are looking for another restaurant. APDC may be a connoisseurs dream come true, but it is not have a flashy environment. APDC's fame comes from its delicious menu of sea food, duck in a can, bison tongue and wines to name a few.   I had the bison tongue as an appetizer. I know, that sounds gross, but it truly has a wonderful taste that I've never tasted before. I then had bison ribs and shared my friends sea food platter of clams, mussels, snails, and something else. I'm not a big fan of mussels or clams, but the rest were wonderfully delicious.   As far as waiting services, though they are hot, I did not feel as though they were the best. I have had better, but I'm not there for the service. I'm there for the food.   If you want some of the best food in Montreal or maybe in all of Canada, then you must try Au Pied De Cochon."}
{"text":"This is a culinary experience unlike any other. The amount of food put upon your table is almost an assault, albeit a wonderful and amazing one. Indeed, the servers warn you to \"pace yourself\" before anything even arrives at your table. One of the special things about the Au Pied cabane a sucre is the ever changing and evolving menu. You will never really know what you'll get. This might frustrate or even disappoint diners who have watched various documentaries or read food reviews about the cabane. It definitely didn't my family and I, we just went with whatever they brought us. Speaking of which.........      The assault started heavy from the beginning for us, with some sort of foie gras gateau that had all sorts of layers of both sweet and savory cake, jam, and of course foie. I never foie for ethical reasons, but I made an exception here, and I'm glad that I did, because this dish was one of the most unique tastes I've ever had in my life. What a great start!!!     There were many dishes we ate that night, actually too many to remember!! Some standouts though- salmon \"meat\" balls in a spicy and sweet stew, an eggplant roasted in squid ink inside a black bread bowl, a short rib stew with maple and chili and of course lots of yummy marrow, and then the epic dessert spread. We were seriously not ready for just how epic this would be, and they even warned us mid meal to please save room for dessert. It was stunning- maple ice cream in a mason jar with toffee crunch and maple yogurt on top (sounds weird, but it was amazing), maple toffy candy on sticks, a mille fuille that was paper thin with layers upon layers of maple pastry cream, and maple baklava. It tasted as good as it all sounds.       My one and only letdown was the bread. It was terrible. Whoever the baker is here should be ashamed to send this bread out to patrons. It was a heavy, yeasty, thick mess. It was clear it had been given little ferment time and little to no kneading or turning/folding. Get a new baker!!!!      Beyond the epically great food is the warm and cozy cabane, and the amazing (and patient) waitstaff. It seems like chaos, but somehow this amazing team of servers, bartenders, and chefs make this place work.       I wish anyone who wants to eat here the best of luck. Getting our reservation was arduous. But, in the end, well worth it. I've eaten at quite a few michelin starred restaurants, and I can say I had a much better time and food here than an at the majority of those. I implore any serious eaters to try and make their way here at least once. It truly is a Mecca of food!!!!"}
{"text":"A punch of flavors in my mouth!   We feasted on foie gras poutine, duck two ways, and the namesake dish, pied de cochon with foie gras -- it was nothing less than decadent. Service was excellent and attentive, even in an extremely busy environment. I would highly recommend getting seats in front of the kitchen for all the action."}
{"text":"prepare to go to this restaurant by bringing a wheelchair. you will not be able to waddle out once you are done. Poutine with Foie Gras is indescribably good. desserts with maple syrup........mmmm  oynque!!!"}
{"text":"I live in NJ. Let me just say this - The Poutine is worth the 6 hour drive up Route 87.   Foie Gras doesn't get any better than this.  Skip the trotter."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Montreal... Best pan seared foie gras I have had anywhere."}
{"text":"Note: I couldn't get reservations since the trip to montreal was last minute but I did ended up ordering takeout from here.  After reading about all the rave reviews, I was excited to try this place out even though I couldn't get reservations. I figured takeout wouldn't be much of a difference and it probably wasn't. I ordered the poutine with foie gras as an appetizer before we head to another restaurant down the block. The taste itself was good but nothing special. I mean, you can't really go wrong with french fries right? The only addition was the gravy which was flavorful and the foie gras which had a weird texture to it...when you bite into one it almost bursts in your mouth in a weird, slightly undercooked way. Anyway, it was nothing special for $23.   I gave this place 3 stars (if I could, it would be 2 1/2) because I wasn't going to give a place 4/5 stars if I never really ate there. If I were to return and have a full meal, I will surely reassess my review and scoring. Anyway, I also disliked the service in the front. There was a young lady who working as the maitre'd and she was just in a whole other world. We told her we wanted to do takeout and she said only certain items on the menu were available for that option. Fine. I asked her for recommendations and she said she was a vegetarian and left it at that. At least say \"but we're known for blah, blah, blah.\" She just said she was a vegetarian and that was it. I had to fish for answers from her. She just seemed like she didn't care and gave an uptight attitude. I wanted to order the duck in a can for takeout but she said they won't heat it up for me and that I would have to boil my own water to heat it up. Mind you, I'm staying at a hotel so how the hell am I going to boil water for a meal? It's takeout...at least have the common courtesy to heat it up for your patrons.   After waiting about 20 min for the poutine, we finally left that place. To my disappointment, she didn't even give us a fork. Doesn't takeout usually include utensils? I would have went back for it if we hadn't left. The experience was such a disappointment that it makes me not want to go back anymore."}
{"text":"Being QuÃ©becois I always have a soft spot for Cuisine du Terroire and without a doubt, Le Pied de Cochon is its Mecca. Martin Picard, the owner and chef of PDC has a penchant for my number favorite food stuff of all time: Foie Gras. His menu is littered with Foie Gras. The menu has items and then with added Foie Gras just to make it even better. Just with that he would score points with me. I was simply unprepared for the ways he presents Foie Gras and it changed everything.  You're probably saying \"Dave, you're going overboard here, Foie Gras is good but it's not life altering\" to which I answer \"Sit down, shut up and read on\" because you obviously haven't been to PDC and have experienced what I have experienced. I'm sure it's the kind f elevating sensation those religious people experience during conversion.  It started with The Cube or as the menu calls it Foie Gras Cromesquis. When your plate is presented the waiter has to give you some instruction first. He explains that it's a Foie Gras Terrine breaded and then deep fried. The terrine is now liquefied so you must wait a minute or two for it cool down and when you do bite down on it, keep your mouth closed. I looked at him with incredulous eyes. I take hold of the breaded cube, put it on my tongue and closed my mouth as the waiters behind the bar looked on, I bit down on it and then... time... stopped... My eyes closed and I wanted to say something but the Cromesquis exploded into a liquid spray of flavor napalm. At that very moment I could have died and it would have ok. This was only the beginning.  I then continued this blissful expedition to culinary perdition with an off-menu item that was offered to us. Fried-Head cheese on a Gribiche sauce. The Head-Cheese was breaded with a smear of goat cheese on top and the Gribiche was just so good that I cleaned out the plate. The head cheese was so far beyond what I expected. The meat tastes so much stronger and is more diverse in flavors. Unbelievable and the best head-cheese I've ever had in my life.  Did you think we we're done with entrÃ©e? Oh HELLLLL NO. Picard mixes Quebec's masterpiece of fast-food with Foie-Gras and turns into an orgasmatron of taste and sensation. Poutine with Foie Gras. Just the idea was mind-boggling and the execution was akin to sex with a very willing firm horny barely legal co-ed. I've had a lot of Foie Gras before but this was simply the most textured, flavored and fragrant one I ever tasted. I just wanted to bash my head on the bar it was so good.  I ordered the restaurant's namesake dish, The Pied de Cochon. Pied de Cochon translated means Pig's Foot. And that's what it was. A whole pig's foot and some of the leg too. It was MASSIVE. The meat is removed braised and then stuffed back in the breaded leg with the hooves. It's layed on a bed of mashed potatoes then covered with a medley of tasty and very aromatic veggies, some of which I failed to Identify. Oh and yeah with a cherry on the top, another artery clogging portion of Foie Gras. The plates was enough to feed a family of rufees for a week and it was impossible for me to finish it but trust me that no meat was left on the plate, just the hooves and some veggies. Pig's leg is easily the tastiest part but it's work to get at sadly and probably explains why my mother only made Pig Leg Stew once a year.  I decided to attack the desert menu. I quickly spotted Pudding ChÃ´meur (poor mans pudding) I had to try Picard's take on this cultural institution. I was not dispointed, it was dessert heaven - though my mom's Pouding chÃ´meur was light years beyond his - and a brilliant close on the evening.  The service was top notch friendly and unpretentious. If you've ever seen Picard's show, he looks like a lumberjack, he's not anything like a snotty pedantic chef, he's all about good food and he'll go and kill it himself to get it on the plate. So his staff is equally relaxed and approachable. I'm not big on chi-chi restaurant experience and this restaurant looks like a sugar shack and is very laid back while still having 2000$ wine bottles on its wine list. Fine Dinning without the dickishness.  Le Pied de Cochon is by far the best restaurant, culinary, eating experience I've ever had and I can't even begin to explain why. All of the above are mere ramblings of a mad man drugged by an experience that will not soon be overcome. I seriously doubt I can find another food experience to top my carnivorous proclivities anytime soon. Best Foie Gras ever, awesome head cheese, sublime Poutine, insane Pig's Feet. It took me about 3 days to come down from the rush. There is a God and his name is Martin Picard."}
{"text":"Ever have a mystical experience with Maple Syrup? I know, it sounds weird. But when Martin Picard decides to cook up his take on \"The Sugar Shack\" you best buckle up and prepare for the second coming.   First he flips it all on you and starts you out with desert... a whole tower of deserts, Whippets, maple pop-corn, some kind of croissant thing with maple, maple taffy, some kind of maple iced Ultra Tim-Bit and this maple flavoured Jell-O/Yogurt thing which was insane.  I won't go into details on each item because, damn this review would be pages and pages long and Yelp won't let me go beyond 5 001 characters.  The tower was supported by Jack Daniel's shooter with maple syrup.  Then came the starters. 4 of them. Each more insane than the other. There was the salad with offal, topped with Oreilles de Christ, the best damn  Oreilles de Christ you've ever had. The waiter informed me they take 3 days to make... I didn't get the details because of the hustle and bustle but it's like eating really amazing pork-rinds in the form of airy Cheetos, without the cheese. Bacon in pop-corn form.  DING DING. You win a bucket of awesome.   The traditional omelette took a direction most wouldn't expect from a Sugar Shack. The omelette had, of course eggs, and potatoes, pornographically thick cut bacon - probably cooked in maple syrup - which I could eat all day. But then comes the \"road less taken\" part. It's also got lots of brains... calf brains to be precise. They were prepared more or less like Picard prepares foie gras and they were just as melt in your mouth. It was the first time I've had calf brains and they weren't much unlike the sheep's brain I tasted a few years back. Simply put, the whole thing was foodgasmic.  Further down the traditional sugar shack menu are the omelette and the baked beans. Picard mashes them together to create magic, real magic... The pancake is topped with baked beans which made my own taste like canned crap and I used to be proud of my baked beans and if that weren't enough... he takes you to town. You see there's also foie gras and smoked salmon and cream and a lot flavour and decadence and it leaves you with the feeling that nothing else can be better. But I was wrong, really wrong...  You see, for me there's The Holy Trifecta of Meat.  It starts with the most loved of all meats; BACON (check) followed by FOIE GRAS (check) and then comes the DUCK...  Yes DUCK. I have a love affair with duck. And Picard just whored it out like a really expensive escort.  Duck confit legs - already perfect - then deep fried and slathered with ooey gooey maple flavoured glaze and some crunchy stuff I didn't have time to identify as I devoured it. So freakin' delicious, I could have eaten a bucket full of those duck legs and then probably would have developed diabetes, but woulda been worth it. Now in my Top 5 courses of all time.  Still reading? Good. I'm about to go into the main. It kinda slows down from here though. There's chicken stuffed with sausage, foie gras and lobster which I'm allergic to so I couldn't eat of it but it looked pretty damn good. There was also a succulent smoked ham with mash potatoes and I thought I was bored out of my mind with ham... but not this one. Basically smoked to the point where's pulled pork, pulled ham maybe? In any case, again, best ham ever. The desert was Maple toffee served in maple ice cream (mindblowing ice cream) followed by a big squishee maple cake. At this point my head was already wobbly from the sugar and I had to call it quits.  As a whole the food is beyond succulent, as you would expect from Martin Picard. The service,  just like his restaurant, is professional and friendly. But I have one small caveat though. I was hoping to escape the feed-lot experience from the other sugar shacks where you are led to a table with uncomfortable seating arrangements and made to eat like cattle and be expulsed outside to wander off until you die from overeating. Just once I'd like to go to a sugar shack and sit on a chair and have room to move around and have more than 2 square feet to occupy.  The meal was the kind of God-Like meal you dream of, the atmosphere was reminiscent of a high-school cafeteria set in a barn. But then there's the Maple Cotton Candy."}
{"text":"Heard about this place through many channels, most currently through word of mouth, but as far back as the episode of Bourdain's travels.   I travel to Montreal a lot and this is the first time with my fiance, so I had to go somewhere nice... Now on to the good stuff.   The only reason why its not a perfect 5 star is because of the missed delivery of my appetizer, its more 4.5 stars, but yelp doesnt have a 4.5... so I rounded up :)   Ratings & Review  - Food - (5 Star)  - Service - (4.5 star) Just because of the missed appetizer, my beers came flowing perfectly  - Decor - (5 star)  - Cost - (5 star) its French people.. come on   Food Had:  - Foie Gras Cromesquis - This was weird, I never had foie gras, but this stuff is amazing, its foie gras cubes battered and deep fried, when you pop it in your mouth, it bursts with the best flavor I've ever experienced, is this foie gras? I am in love then!   - Piglet Roast - Sliced pork, nothing much else to say, I was not too fond of this, pretty bland   - Fries (in duck fat) - They actually have a guy devoted to just making fries, he throws how the cold ones and make them to order, tastes amazing   - Duck in a can - WOW amazing, it took a while to arrive because it needs to cool down, but when you bite into it... OMG amazing!, I just can't see myself eating the duck skin... it was pretty thick...  Tip: (1) Reservation is a must (2) Sit at the bar, the first 4 seats are awesome, you see all the action in the kitchen! (3) If you sit at the bar, wear something you don't mind at the end of the night smelling like the kitchen!"}
{"text":"My first sugar shack experience was a wonderful one here at Au Pied du Cochon. There were a total of over 8 or so courses beautifully presented. I consumed my whole life's quantity of foie gras that night because there was foie gras in almost every single dish. Besides almost getting a pleasant heart attack from all the maple syrup and foie gras, it was one of the most flavourful and unique dining experiences I've ever had in Quebec. The waiting list is months long so better book early if you want to give it a try! :)"}
{"text":"Chef/Owner Martin Picard has certainly gotten his fair share of great press in the last year.  Chef and Raconteur Anthony Bourdain proclaimed this his favorite restaurant and Chef Picard was featured in his own multi-page article in Gourmet Magazine's dedicated Montreal issue last year.  A true practioner of the art of \"terroir\", Chef Picard has connected to local suppliers of everything from greens to foie gras to maple syrup and has crafted a menu that is uniquely Quebecois - not a pale immitation of any other cuisine.  Unabashedly meaty, their menu offers a surplus of wild game options and you can get Foie Gras on almost everything.  Now the concept of \"too much foie gras\" is generally alien to me, but if it could happen anywhere, it's happening here.  For an appetizer, we had a \"Napolean\" with Foie Gras, maple syrup and I can't remember much else.  Unbelievably rich, this was tasty, but the maple did overwhelm the subtlety of the Foie and it ended up feeling a little like we were having fat for fat's sake rather than a true delicacy.  Other dishes were better - we certainly enjoyed the lobster roll - just like the Maine classic, on lovely, thick, and delicate toasted bread, but again...the lobster was coated in Foie Gras...not really necessary (or particularly adding anything to the lobster).  The bustling interior is packed and noisy, but not so much that you can't participate in a conversation.  The food was all very tasty, but after all of the build-up, a tad disappointing.  If you only had a night or two in Montreal, I'd recommend Pintxo (intimate setting and perfect tapas) or Club Chasse et Peche (a more refined terroir experience and amazingly well executed and balanced cuisine in a funky setting - a former hunting and fishing club's restaurant, updated to hip nouveau dining hotspot).  Still, if you're a fan of terroir and need that meaty fix and can't get enough artery-clogging Foie in your diet...Au Pied de Cochon is the place for you."}
{"text":"How good was your greatest meal? How did you react? What did it make you feel?  During my trip to WorldCon in Montreal, a group of ten of us made our way to Au Pied de Cochon. We were a group from around the world: the UK, Israel, Australia, Seattle, the Bay Area. It was an amazing group and it led to fantastic conversation. The place is much smaller than I expected, but it was rough, not at all polished. There were visible boxes of stuff all over the place. That's a nice touch. it makes it feel less refined, which makes the food even better.   We had a huge selection of stuff. My extremely tall buddy Niall had the Bison Rib. it looked like it would tip over the Flintstone's car for sure. The Lovely & Talented Linda had the Hot Pot. It was amazing. We had Duck in a Can, Duck Carpaccio, the fried cubes of fois gras, amazing poutine and I had a Shepard's Pie.   My first bite and I nearly cried.   No, seriously, it was that good. I had to stop, set down my fork and let myself get centered. I couldn't show weakness in front of the Brits. They may just try and run us over again. I loved the potatoes, the light cheese, the meat. It was all so perfect together.   I absolutely loved it all. I couldn't speed through it. I had to go slow, had to come around slowly, take every bite, let it roll around. It was fantastic.   I kept saying \"this is the most amazing meal of my life\" and it was  The only downside to this place is that it gets crowded and noisy. The night I was there we were joined by Connie Willis, George R. R. Martin, Gardner Dozois and the folks from Locus Magazine. It was loud enough that we had trouble hearing our own conversaations.   But no words were needed: it was the most amazing meal of my life."}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon had the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  They were so creamy and cheesy.  The consistency was like no other mashed potatoes I've ever had and they were exquisite.  The rest of the menu was good, but nothing else stood out.  If you like meat, you should be happy with the plethora of choices at this place.  The server was very patient and helped navigate the menu.  Definitely need a reservation!"}
{"text":"I don't know if \"hhhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnghgonwfvnip\" constitutes a proper yelp review. So here's the post I made on facebook as a placeholder until I manage to digest and can write something more coherent.  Takeout dinner from Au Pied du Cochon. Got trapped by storm so had to cancel original reservation, so takeout it was to be. Unable to consider moving. Duck in a can was fabulous (Duck, balsamic, thyme, random veggies, slab of foie gras). Onion soup out of this world (apparently there's actually meat in it). Boudin noir waiting in the wings. Photos later when I remember how to work my phone. Unnnnngh."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally be able to step foot into this place. Coming in without a reservation was a huge mistake, the night was packed and the maitre'd asked us if we like to reserve a table for the next night. Disappointed, we made the reservations anyways.  The next night when we arrived, the restaurant was as packed as the night before. We got seated instantly. My boyfriend and I pretty knew what we would like and when we finally tried to place our order of the Pig's Head for Two, the waiter told us they were out. We were shocked and I can see from the boyfriend's eyes that he was disappointed. But the waiter made an effort to put \"something\" together for us in place of the Pig's Head.   We had an appetizer platter which was amazing since it consist of tongue, pate, terrine, sausage, pickled egg, and some toast. Next, I had ordered the Bison Tongue, which was absolutely phenominal (and I don't use that word often). The tongue was so tender and soft, literally just melts in your mouth without biting and usually tongue are a bit tougher. We were told to order the Foie Gras Cromesquis, little balls of goodness. You pop the entire ball in your mouth and just let the ooey goodness fill every crevis and corner of your mouth.  Our entree finally came, I thought we would have a problem finishing it since it did consist of a lot of thing, but once again the boyfriend proved me wrong. The dish that had quail, ribs, pork, belly, foie gras, duck, tongue and various vegetables made us content. A dish that was off the menu and clearly assemble out of the blue, but served its purpose.  I would love to come back for the Pig's Head sometime soon. Note to self: reserve the Pig's Head."}
{"text":"What is there to say after all these glowing reviews? Well I'll tell you: their toilets suck. They do. As a matter of fact you'll first direct yourself to the cellar thinking it to be the bathroom, but no, it is behind the bar! The sink is an over sized basin fit to wash children in, and you don't get liquid soap, but rather a still-foamy bar. I'm baffled by a bad bathroom, let alone one which can afford itself a flat screen tv, but not just ANY flat screen tv, the worst of them all: the one which broadcasts golf. Why would I EVER want to watch golf, in a bathroom of all places?  Everything has been said about the food: it is rich, but let's put things into perspective: I can handle a full Hooters meal, or a full sugar-schack meal with doubles AND extra maple syrup on ice. Au pied de Cochon is... alright. It is heavy, so eat light before going, but you know, I was expecting absolute decadence and didn't find it, but I think it might have more to do with my order. My foie gras poutine was surprisingly small and I ordered an extra cone of fries to finish the sauce (a bit too salty as others have mentioned). My mom was delighted with her foie gras pie as appetizer and the tongue in tarragon is definitely worth trying! The lobster risotto was huge and, for the very first time, my Dad could not finish his meal, a black pudding pie (also excellent, excellent black pudding). My lemon tart was warm and crumbling under gooey meringue and my mom raved about her creme brulÃ©e. All in all a lovely meal.   Why only 4 stars then, and tbh I was on the verge of putting 3? I have a couple little hang-ups about the place, the biggest one being the slight...pompousness of it all. oOHH they can afford not to have a sign with their name! Admit it, their customer service is non-existent. Should you try to call, a pre-recorded message will endlessly tell you to leave a message, and then you're left to pray they might bother to call you back. I found our waiter to be, a bit arrogant (although my parents assured me that was the typical friendly European way! Like, whatever). I notice a couple of people have mentioned not getting what they ordered, I'm sure that could be helped if the waiters would write down orders in the first place. I wasn't terribly impressed by seeing a member of the staff dust the air vents above the tables while we were eating. Sitting on top of the A/C van didn't help my mood or digestion. The place is incredibly cramped and ..I don't know, reading the reviews I guess I was expecting to reach Nirvana or something...    and then there was golf in the bathroom."}

{"text":"It's hard to know where to start here. How about with AMAZING!!!!! This was my first trip to Montreal in 20 years. This place was highly recommended to me and it exceeded all expectations. We had made reservations about a month ago for the bar where you can watch the food prep. The room is small, narrow and loud. Sitting at the bar makes it a little more difficult to hear and I had to focus in on the waiter more. Tip #1, listen to your waiter. He/she will definitely use French as their 1st language but English is no problem. With the loudness, you do have to focus in more on what the waiter has to say. They know what's fresh and how to order.   Oddly enough, we started with a snow crab appetizer. Not know for seafood, but we were told the crab season just opened and they had just got a shipment this morning. It was soooooo good! Simply prepared, it came with homemade tarragon mayonnaise  to dip in. The crab meat was sweet and succulent. The dish was a lot of fun too. They served a hot bowl of water with hand cloths to clean up after.   Now for the granddaddy of them ALL! The guinea hen for 2. This is the absolute ultimate in fowl. The guinea hen body is roasted to succulent perfection. The legs and wings are removed prior to cooking and are seared and confited then reassembled with a wood skewer. The bird is served whole with carving knives. Again, it's a super fun dish that was even tastier. The bird is served on a mashed potatoes and mushroom and root vegetables. The mashed and vegetables were incredibly rich but it was like eating drugs or something. Once you start you can't stop. Do not plan on going out to party after this meal. You will want to curl out and chill for sure.  I can't speak highly enough of this place. Canadiens and the people of Montreal were incredibly welcoming and made us feel right at home. The bread, beer, wine and attention to detail were incredible as you would expect from a Martin Picard restaurant. Next time, Sugar Shack!"}
{"text":"The menu was daunting - who eats half that stuff (a special was a salad with veal heart!), however the staff was amazingly helpful.  We started with the much raved about poutine.  I guess I just don't get poutine, it wasn't bad but I wouldn't get it again.  Our main courses were delicious.  I has the fish and chips special - made with sturgeon and melt in your mouth good.  My husband had the boudin tart - couldn't believe how good it was.  Have to say, though, way too much food - we should have shared an entree.  Best of all we were surprised the bill was quite reasonable."}
{"text":"My last meal in MontrÃ©al was a doozy. Friday evening, I made sure to walk over to Au Pied de Couchon when it opened in order to make a reservation for the weekend. Even as a single it was impossible to find a spot for Saturday, so Sunday it was. I took a shower, put on some makeup and took myself out on a date. In doing research for this trip, the internet screamed \"Au Pied de Couchon\"! It's apparently extremely popular right now. However, I thought there would be a bit more couchon in my dish than there actually was. What this place is known for is their foie gras dishes. Had I known, I would have tried to get a reservation at ToquÃ© or another restaurant that served high end local food. I have no regrets about this meal, however. Excellence, all around. The restaurant itself is a nice size- intimate without being cramped- warm and welcoming. The kitchen is open and gives off an air of controlled chaos that lends a more casual air to the whole ambiance.   After being seated, I struck up conversation with the woman on my left, a fellow Los Angelina in town for business. She insisted I take some of her duck-fat fried french fries. I knew duck-fat roasted potatoes were good, but oh my god. These were insanely good. Crisp on the outside, flavorful-everything you want in a good french fry. My waitress recommended a Bergerac Cabernet Francais, which was exactly the perfect pairing. To start I ordered the Roast Piglet, served cold and thinly sliced with a tuna mayo. Yes, tuna mayo. I was apprehensive, but it was a perfect pairing. The pork was perfectly cooked and velvety with the mayo. I brought home the left overs, since it was a huge plate of meat, to give to the girls on duty at the hostel (yay new friends!) and they devoured it with as much surprised glee as I did.   For my main I got the La Plogue Ã  Champlain. Buckwheat pancake, potatoes, foie gras, maple syrup, thick cut maple cured bacon (which tasted more like lardo), and cheddar cheese. I thought this was going to be too rich, too much and it was rich, but really well balanced and not overwhelming at all. There was the perfect amount of salt and sweet to offset the richness of the foie gras and the earthiness of the buckwheat pancake rounded the whole thing out.   The fatty bacon was so freaking good. Because of how it was cut and cured, it tasted more like a cured pork and lardo, as opposed to just bacon in a dish. It kind of blew my mind. It's pretty much impossible to pick out the individual ingredients in this dish. They just all meld together to attack your senses with a most pleasing result. I'm sure I made all sorts of happy noises as I ate. It happens, OK?  I thought I couldn't eat any more after this. So much sweet! So much salty! So much foie gras! But my new friend to the left offered the uneaten half of her dessert and who am I to decline a gift of pot de crÃ¨me au chocolat noir? Like everything else here, this is Rich. Definitely a dish to be shared. The velvety chocolate pudding was topped with graham cracker crumble and whipped cream. Pretty much perfection. Thankfully it wasn't too sweet, just the right balance of good chocolate flavor. A successful meal, entirely."}
{"text":"One of the top restaurants in Montreal. We always make a point to eat here when we visit.  Go hungry because the food is decadent Quebecois fare. Martin Picard (the chef and owner) embraces gluttony, and so should you if you eat at Au Pied de Cochon."}
{"text":"This is one of those reviews where I wonder if I missed something, everyone seems head over heels in love with au pied de cochon, but I was not that impressed.    First, the service and dÃ©cor.  The service was pretty slow, we were there for about 3 and a half hours.  There had to be at least a 45 minute wait between our apps and our entrees.  Our waitress was polite and friendly, but wasn't around that often.  She did help pick a great bottle of wine after my original choice was no longer available.  My water glass was empty quite a few times, but that's a busboy issue.  The dÃ©cor and layout was a bit odd, they obviously made the conscientious decision to choose cramming as many people in as possible over comfort and style.    Second, the food.  I'm really torn about how to describe the food.  I think the best way is to say that each item was one of the most delicious things I've ever had - for the first 1 - 2 bites.  After that, it got gross kinda quick.  I am no stranger to rich foods, and I subscribe to the French (or Paula Deen) school of thought that cooking with butter makes everything better, but this food was just over the top.  I started with a Duck Carpaccio. Carpaccio is usually light and fresh and this one was too, until I broke the egg yolk over the entire dish as instructed.  Then it just got creamy and all the flavors got muddled and didn't really work well together.  Someone else ordered the Foie Gras Poutine, and I really couldn't stomach much more than a few bites.  Again, I have to think I'm missing something here because everyone raves about it.  To me, it's taking something completely trashy like Disco Fries and trying to class it up by adding some Foie Gras and cheese curds.  The duck in the can was undercooked and again, completely over the top with Foie (apparently the duck is supposed to come out under done according to the wait staff).  The main entrÃ©e was the rabbit special for 2 - 3 people.  It's a whole rabbit, with the head braised in red wine, two legs sous-vide (I believe), two legs roasted, and the remainder of the rabbit rolled and stuffed with foie and roasted / baked, all served over a creamy polenta.  The roasted legs were amazing, but moving onto the torso sections, the meat was completely overpowered by the foie.    All in all it seems that the point of this restaurant is to eat as much Foie Gras as possible.  It's not done in a classy way, where a little goes a long way, but an in your face Foie Gras fest.  Maybe it's unfair for me to rate au pied de cochon based on not liking a specific type of food (i.e. Poutine) - especially without having any other point of reference, but I think the over the top ideology of throwing Foie Gras around like it's rosemary or salt and pepper is really the underlying issue here.  I just don't get this place."}
{"text":"Over the top food, excellent service, one of the most memorable meals we've had in Montreal. We shared everything so we could taste as much as we can. First off, there is never ending always crispy and warm French baguette throughout the meal. We had the foie gras fried cubes, regular poutine and the foie gras & boudin tart. Last one was mind blowing in its richness and balance. Also shared the maple pudding which can also be described as bread soaked in a pool of butter in the stickiest and most delicious way. People were still being seated as we left around 10 so definitely make a reservation in advance. And it's SO worth it."}
{"text":"Certainly worth visiting especially if you are only in Montreal for a brief visit.  It is one of the top restaurants in Montreal.  The unique menu is has a few choice selections including the canned duck which is excellent.  Really unique approach to preparing high quality food..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant and the only reason why I am giving it a 4 is because one of the dish was too salty.   However, despite the saltiness, it was worthwhile!  The bread kept coming, our waitress was knowledgeable and other wait staff were accommodating (they kept the bread flowing when they realized we were low), my duck in a can was delicious and the foie gras? It was excellent. My sister's dish, the Pork Loin, was too peppery and salty but the overall dish - the pork itself- was delicious. Not sure how the tofu works with the pork loin dish (it felt like the dish was not well rounded or thought out since the tofu seemed so random) but we are very glad that we came here.   It was a heavy meal but very much worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I've had some of the best meals of my life here but last night I ordered the veal special and it was impossible to eat because the meat was so chewy and covered in tendons. When the waiter came to ask if all was well I told him about it and he asked \"what do you want us to do about it\", my husband told him \"nothing, yo just asked how it was and we told you.\". Needless to say they lost 2 customers for life"}
{"text":"Probably not much has been left unsaid about Au Pied de Cochon. Its one of the heaviest, most indulgent meals I've ever had. It is beyond rich and fatty. But the food does live up to the hype.   Started off with coppa and bread, which may be one of the best charcuterie plates I've had. Also got the duck in a can, which was pretty good. Very rich, but very flavorful. Only knock on it is that the fat on the duck is not rendered off enough, which made it super fatty. I enjoy fatty/rich/decadent foods but this was too fatty even for me. I also tried the foie burger, which was as delicious and artery clogging as I expected.   The desserts are just okay. Or maybe my heart had already stopped and I couldn't enjoy it as much.   The restaurant is loud inside and they play a lot of loud rock music, which wasn't the vibe I was expecting. My main knock in this restaurant, which is why I didn't give it a 5 (because the food is definitely a 5) is the service.   The service is spotty. I had specifically reserved 4 seats at the bar (so I could see how the kitchen works), but they had given that up to someone else. So I we got seated at a table. When I arrived, they said the people at the bar were getting their check and wrapping up, but as I walked by, the people at the bar were just getting started. No one else got seated between the time I arrived and when I got seated, so something does not smell right. The waitress we had was not nice and did not want to explain anything on the menu for us. She seemed very dismissive and gave off a \"you should know this, if you're eating here\" vibe. Not helpful at all.  We also asked for our bill on 3 different occasions and still didn't get it. It took about 20 minutes for us to get the bill. Very disappointing service."}
{"text":"Sooo yums!  Only had room in my tummy to share the poutine au foie gras with 3 others....very yums!  MUST try!  Good luck making resos!"}
{"text":"Let's put it this way. You came all the way to Montreal. it's not right  to leave without having a maple sugar high - which I managed to obtain in au pied du cochon.   Don't get me wrong, their signature dish is amazing - it's a great pig out! So much that I had to yelp \"get that away please \" when the waiting staff asked whether I'm done with it!   Starters are on the small side, but given how big their mains are, it all make sense. Maybe a better portion control is needed!   Also their wine is amazing, reminded me of some of the vintage I had in France..."}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon cares about their clients. As hectic and busy as it can get (see for yourself) you will NEVER be left unattended, the waiters know the menu like the back of their hand- ingredients, taste, suggestions; they know it all.    The restaurant is self-explanatory. This is not a diet-meal restaurant, you come here to feast.  Pricing is not inexpensive but fair and to be expected for quality food.  As an entrÃ©e, we had the \"tuna cake tartar\" which was a seasonal special not indicated in the menu. It was good, not great. If you are Oriental or often eat sushi, don't order this. Basically this is a layered \"cake\". First layer was a crispy dough/rice cake, then the rice and topped off with the tuna and beets.   We then had the foie gras poutine, probably worth the buck and worth to try in my opinion; this is not your typical poutine dish but more on the gourmet and adventurous side. So you have your typical fries and cheese curd then comes the white sauce which is a foie gras based gravy with slices of foie gras on the poutine.   Last but not least we ended up having the seasonal special (not on the menu) steamed tuna  with vegetable and foie gras for forty something dollar- not out of this world but quality is there.   The verdict is, the customer service is excellent; if I had my own business that's how I would want my team to be. In terms of food, if it's your first time this is quite an experience but I don't think I would come back any time soon."}
{"text":"A very inappropriate place to keep a diet!  But oh so good!  We just watched a PBS show in our hotel before departing for APDC that said that fatty food was actually good for you!  Perfect timing!  Since it was our first time, one of us had to have the Duck in a Can and while a little pricey compared to other dishes, it was excellent!  Amazed they got that much duck breast and froie gras in a tin can and cooked perfectly rare for duck.  I could not finish all.  Kept the can too, don't know why but I did.  We actually started with the fried froie gras and it was excellent and melted in mouth as our server said....wait one minute before popping the cube - one bite does it...only $3.50...a must.  Then we had the Terrine of Froie Gras with a toasted baguette and every last molecule of froie gras was consumed since it's a banned substance in California!  Our other entree was the Veal with gnocchi - fall off the bone tender and tasty!  No room for dessert.  Don't eat anything heavy or for 10 hours before your meal, this will allow you to enjoy one more dish maybe."}
{"text":"I love Martin Picard's restaurant. The ONLY thing preventing this from being 5 stars is that I found the place a bit cramped, and we sat beside the doorway on a cold winter evening, so was a bit drafty for me (I wore my jacket indoors).  Otherwise, the food is fantastic. Now, I'm not going to wax poetic about the restaurant namesake dish -- so delicious -- or how a simple sugar pie blew my mind. It's all been said in the past reviews.  What I do want to say is that Martin Picard has created a high level restaurant that's actually accessible to different types of financial circumstances. This is super important in that allows you to have no awkward situations with friends who may choose to simply have a $20 or under meal (one entree can be argued to feed two people due to the portions), while someone else in the table decides to blow the bank with $100+. There are options for whatever your gastronomic budget for the evening may be.  So, if you're thinking of a place that offers great food and service with varying price ranges, this is the place for you. Definitely a must-go if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"I had eaten here a few weeks ago while I was visiting Montreal with friends. I figured this place had gotten such good review I would try it myself. The quality of the food here is great but the prices are up there. The staff friendly and very efficient.  I thought the size of the restaurant was a little on the narrow side and trying to just walk to the restroom was a challenge if someone was also in your path. With that being said the noise level was high too. All and all if you are in the area definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is just not that great.  Ordered the Cured Foie Gras & Boudin Tart.  This one was one me.  Wanted to try Foie Gras and realized I didn't like it.  Not the dish to get if you're trying Foie Gras for the first time because if you don't like it, that's that.  Was really disappointed with the Duck in a Can that I had heard so much about.  The meat was hard and tasteless.  The taste I did get was from the layers and layers of oil it comes with.    The food took and hour and change to come out.  We were starving by the time the food came out.  After a few bites we were done :(  The best part of the whole night was the Raspberry Mohito (not what I had in mind).  While I'm a NY'er, I don't consider myself picky and will enjoy just about any food.  Just be careful with what you order.  Otherwise, you'll end up with a $115 + mistake on your hands.  PS:  Montreal was awesome."}
{"text":"Must do when in Montreal. Have been here a few times and food is consistent with great service.  We probably have tried everything on the menu and nothing I wouldn't recommend.  Has gotten a bit more touristy that last few years."}
{"text":"Rarely (ever?) does a restaurant ever live up to this much hype.  It's gotta be a gimmick, right?  Nope.    Almost everything on the menu is either fried, smothered in a rich mushroom sauce, or stuffed with copious amounts of foie gras (and if you order correctly...all 3.)  We stuck to the staples: The Foie Gras Cromesquis, Foie Gras Poutine, Duck in A Can, Stuffed Pied de Cochon.  All were excellent, but the Cromesquis were life changing.  Is it decadent?..sure.  Over the top?...maybe.  But you only live once.  And there's always Lipitor."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Boston and looking for a great meal. We found it at Au Pied De Cochon. A great bar tender recommended this great restaurant and I'm glad we listened.   To start of we got very lucky with getting a table on a Sat. night w/o any reservations.  The server was great. He translated everything to English and suggested the Plogue a Champlain. It was delicious!! Maple syrup and Foie gras on the same plate--what a great idea!! My bf had the Pate chinois du PDC and that was also great--he loved it! The creme brulee was perfect-- rich & creamy with a lovely caramelized top!!  The service was fantastic and we ended up chatting with the couple at the table next to us who were also visiting from NY & DC. They said they frequent Au Pied De Cochon every time they are in Montreal.  The server was kind enough not rush the service or turn the table and let us enjoy our meal and conversation---That was very impressive!!  A++ All together a great experience and we will be back next time we are in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Make a reservation and check your diet at the door. This place ranks as one of my top 10 culinary adventures. Thank you Anthony  Bourdain! I sadly can't remember the name of our foie gras appetizer, but it was one of the best things I ever ate. Buckwheat pancake, potatoes, cheese, smoked pork, a BIG ol slab of foie gras and maple syrup. OMG. Heaven on a plate. Duck in a can and the melting pot were really good, but the appetizer was on a different planet of good.   Atmosphere is casual (more so than I expected), but it's all about the food. Where else can you find an entire menu section devoted to foie gras? Take your cholesterol pills and prepare for an eating experience. You'll eat too much, and be glad you did."}
{"text":"Opted for the tasting menu here and it was one of the most decadent meals of my life.  Think foie gras everything topped with more foie gras.  Nothing that hasn't already been said, but highlights included their infamous duck in a can, pork shank, and squid ink seafood pasta.    Recommend if visiting Montreal for the first time."}
{"text":"If you find Foie Gras offensive, please don't read this review or visit this restaurant.  If, on the other hand, you have no issue with overfeeding yourself on overfed food, then this might just be the best restaurant you will ever go to.  I currently rate it in my top 5 lifetime and have the experience and burgeoning gut to prove it.  The restaurant serves up a great mix of fine french and regional cuisine, with a bit of a comical twist at times.  Further, all sections of the menu include some kind of Foie Gras offering.  For example, for a starter I ordered their version of Poutine (a Montreal drunken specialty consisting of fries, gravy, and cheese curds).  Their version complimented the offering with a \"healthy\" dose of Foie Gras as well as Foie Gras gravy.  For my main course I had a Foie Gras burger and my friend had the Tripe Pizza.  All of it was pure culinary genius.  You just know that the folks here love what they do and work hard to make the meals creative, delicious, and indulgent.  To top it off, the wine selection was broad and reasonable and the coffee and sweets perfect.  If you have but one night in Montreal, you should eat here and forget about the guilt until the morning."}
{"text":"Indulgence and excess of the highest order is how I'll remember my night at APDC. This was a meal to end all meals. We had reservations for 8:00 pm on a Wednesday and I almost wish we hadn't eaten anything the whole day. We knew we were in for a night of unrivaled gluttony the moment we walked in, smelled the food and noticed the huge portions sizes on some of the plates.  We wanted to start off with something kind of light (by APDC's standards) and got the blue cheese salad,  a sizable plate that came with endives and chunks of blue cheese.  I tried not to use too much cheese on the bread they had given us when we sat down but their fresh bread was addictive and helped balance out the strong cheese.  The second dish was one of the specials on the night - baked clam with cheese sauce. I have a hard time stopping myself from trying clams whenever it's on the menu, especially at a place like this when I knew they would prepare it in a way I've never had before. It didn't disappoint. As heavy as the sauce was, the flavors were well balanced and even though each bite was probably a hundred calories, I couldn't help myself from mopping up some of the sauce with more bread.  We were already getting full so when informed that our Pied de Cochon with foie gras was going to take a bit of time to come out, we were glad.  When it finally arrived, any delusions we had of trying the duck in a can afterwards quickly disappeared. It's as if French gastronomy took a look in the mirror, didn't like what it saw, and decided to get juiced. All I could do at first was look at the huge portion size of the dish and then feel intimidated by the size of the foie gras sitting on top of the pile of pig knuckles, chunks of pork and onions . Somehow after an hour of battling this dish, aided on by 3 shots of single malt Scotch, we emerged victorious. The only thing I lost in the process was my dignity.  APDC is not the place to come and hold back. This place is a weight watcher's worst nightmare... but sometimes it's good to be bad and if you are thinking of going all out,  there's every reason for you to come here."}
{"text":"Food was a 3.5 but I'm rounding up to 4 because of the nicest, friendliest, and entertaining bartender  I relied on Yelp to help me plan what to eat during my visit to Montreal. I saw that Au Pied de Cochon was the #1 restaurant on Yelp in Montreal. I figured well that's a must! First off, we tried to make reservations via phone for several days during various times (e.g., before 5pm, after 5pm, after 7pm, after 10pm) and we left voice messages. We still couldn't get in touch with them to make a reservation. We came in on a Saturday early evening around 5:30. Luckily, there were seats at the bar with no wait. Although the restaurant was empty, all the tables were reserved. They did fill up quickly as the night went on. I experienced such wonderful and fun service at the bar that I'm so happy we were never able to make reservations! The bartender offered us a drink, samples of his cocktails, samples of garnishes (i.e., ground cherry, toffee chips)! It was also fun to see him make his cocktails with his wide smile and sense of humor! Really made the whole experience a lot of fun!  Food: In my opinion, it was just OK. A bit salty. Nothing spectacular.  Poutine with foie gras: definitely my favorite dish; foie gras was delicious and the whole dish just went well together Melting pot pork dish: a mixture of different cuts of pork; pretty tasty; came with mashed potatoes as well A replacement duck dish for a sold out menu dish was too salty. I don't remember the name but it was duck wrapped in some kind of pasta/crepe covered with mushroom sauce. I wasn't a fan.  Beefsteak: pretty good, but nothing special. came with fries dipped in duck fat which didn't taste any different from regular fries.  I think my experience here wasn't as great as other yelpers because there were a lot of dishes that they no longer served or were out of. IDK...maybe we should have gotten the duck in a can???! Oh well.. at least the poutine was good.."}
{"text":"An experience you must have. First the selection of foods i was lost as i did not know what to have. The ambience is relaxed, dynamic and all about food. The open cuisine give you a peek of what to expect. I am a person that experience food visually first ,when that is satisfied the taste buds come in hand .  We were 3 persons , waited in line to get seated ( reservation is a must especially at night) , the waitress was very pleasant and professional helped us get our selection in order. We shared the bison temaki, the salad and bison tongue all tasty and very well presented. I took the foie gras burger, what a taste !! simply delicious but gigantic . One of my friends took the Duck in a Can ; definitely my pick for next visit. We shared different selection of deserts , my favourite was the tarte au sucre. Wine selection is good but prices are on the higher end;  with such a culinary experience a good wine or a beer will complement the dishes. One of my best places in Montreal.  Will definitely return and i highly recommend it."}
{"text":"After looking at all the great reviews. Decided to check this place out. We ordered the foie gras lobe that costed $120. It was either 500g or 600g of foie gras. It takes an hour to make this dish. It consisted of foie gras, ham, bread and berries. I did not like this dish. It was not to my liking. I did not expect this dish to come sweet and fruity. When the waiter said that there was a dessert that came with it. I didn't think that it was going to mixed inside with the foie gras. It was odd, different from the foie gras served at other restaurants.   They had delicious bread too. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.    Presentation wise. The food was not appeal.   On the good side, their service was great! The server came by really often to fill water.   I may consider coming back to try their other foie gras dishes as they have a wide selection. But the foie gras lobe is totally not worth it. It just didn't taste good to me."}
{"text":"Guys. Guys! Would like you to know that for me it lived up to the hype. How wrong can you really go with foie foie foie, but also there was perfectly cooked meats and lentils, rich yet balanced flavors and a high note with every dish. Can we talk about the lentils for a moment? Lentils are difficult. It's hard, for me at least, to get that just right consistency of not mushy, firm but not raw.   If you want the tl;dr version: This is one of the finest examples of traditional QuÃ©bÃ©cois food  Also, I'm including pictures of all of them!  Foie Gras Cromesquis Foie Gras Poutine Plogue a Champlain Salmon Rillettes Meatloaf Veal Loins Duck in a Can Pork Chop with Legumes  Foie Gras Cromesquis Fried foie gras with a liquid center. Different and interesting. It was good in the way anything foie is minimally good, but it wouldn't order it again. Good to try.   Foie Gras Poutine Um. Yeah. Chunks of poutine two types of gravy that tastes like you would not believe. If you like foie, it will put you in goose liver heaven  Plogue a Champlain I'm still not sure what all I ate. It was like they put Quebec in a plate and wrapped it in a buckwheat blanket and drowned in, obviously, gravy and maple. Some things that I think I ate: bacon, foie, cheese, egg and l'amour. And a heart attack. Worth it.   Salmon Rillettes Thank goodness for this dish. It was a wonderful palate cleanser as the lightest thing we ate. It would stand alone wonderfully and was probably my second favorite thing the whole meal. For the record: yes, I called it the lightest thing on the menu. Yes. Salmon mixed into an artery busting amount of butter and sour cream/creme fraiche was the lightest thing our entire meal. But this is the type of meal where considering the amount of cream and butter and fat is verboten.   Meatloaf Americans, this ain't your grandma's meatloaf (unless your grandma was from Quebec). It was sweet and soft with this almost curry-ish gravy and topped with butter beans.   Veal Loins Perfectly cooked. Excellent flavor. Not the best bite of the meal, but if you served it to me any random day I would be glad to eat it. Another sweet and savory dish.   Duck in a Can \"Inside (the can) we have half a duck magret. 100 g of foie gras. Cabbage, onions, bacon, thyme and garlic cooked in butter. And a reduction of balsamic vinegar. The magret is cooked sealed with everything else in boiling water for 27 minutes.\" Yup.   Pork Chop with Legumes How could we leave without any Cochon? This was a very good porkchop with those lentils, remember, that were cooked so perfectly? I wish I had more pictures of the color of the cooked meat. Just close your eyes and imagine perfect. Et voila!"}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon was recommended to me by a friend and who must really like me because this place was amazing.  Let me begin by saying that I've never heard of APdC before my trip to Montreal and I attempted to \"walk in\" on a Sunday night.  Don't do what I did, it was stupid.  Make a reservation.  The wait at 8:30 on a Sunday was 2 and a half hours, not knowing where else to eat, I put my name and number on the list and went for a drive.  The Hostess called a half hour later and said some seats opened up at the bar and I hurried back.    The restaurant has a glass windowed front dinning area, seats at the bar/kitchen in the middle and more seating in the back.  I'd suggest sitting at the bar if you can, that way you can watch the cooks at work.  The menu is in French but most, if not all, of the waitstaff can speak English and are very helpful.  The menu is broken down between apps, foie gras, entrees, and an assortment of meat dishes by category (poultry, pig, bison or deer).  Not knowing French, I opted for the dish named after the restaurant but we'll get back to that.  APdC is known for their foie gras as is the rest of Montreal but the thing to order is the Poutine au foie gras.  It's like an order of cheesy fries, but the cheese is foie gras.  It will blow your mind.  Also good, are the Cromesquis de foie gras which are fried balls of foie gras that you eat in one bite and explode in your mouth.  Back to the entree - I ordered au pied de cochon and it was delicious.  It tasted like the dark meat of a turkey but so moist and fatty and this review just got dirty.  The fact is, I had no idea that what i was eating was pig's feet and had I known what it was, I might not of but it was damn good and would recommend it.  It did come with mash potatoes as a side that were okay but the meat was the winner.  They finish the feet in the oven so the succulent meat is encased in crispy, fatty skin. YUM!  No room for dessert but I did have the namesake's beer which was a nice and light beer to accompany the meal.    This is a must go, if you are in Montreal for any period of time.  Parking is on the street and be sure to note the address.  I drove past the simple facade twice before I noticed the Pig above the entrance.  Note: APdC is not open on Mondays as I found out when wanting to go back for seconds.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oh! shall I count the ways I love thee Au PDC.  1. The Foie gras poutine - yes we had to try it, yes it was perfect, yes, no other poutine will ever compare now. 2. The duck fat fried fries - yummy... why not add carbs to a caloric overloaded meal. Why not harp on about dieting for 2 weeks before coming to Montreal just to come to PDC. I love thee pomme frittes. 3.  Pied De Cochon - of course we had to try the signature dish, or is that foe gras? Does it matter? The PDC had not only the pig foot but Foie gras as well. It was an experience and not bad at all.  4. The Duck in a Can - Ha!! We had to try it... the sauce was sublime, the duck tender and the Foie gras excellent. We overindulged, we sinned, and it was a beautiful thing. I wanted to walk back to the hotel many miles away, but could not.  I don't normally follow Bourdain, but I can empathize with him over Au pied de cochon. Chef Picard almost killed me, and it would have been the perfect way to go."}
{"text":"So I'll start off by saying that my boo and I are complete piggies.    Nearly everything we ate had foie gras or was fried in duck fat... or both. We got like 5 plates of food and gorged ourselves until our bellies were fully distended. Even our waiter was giving us looks of doubt as he delivered an entree of veal tartare with MORE duck fat fries. Needless to say, we walked halfway home just to get our metabolism back up to speed.   I probably looked like a happy pregnant woman. Just enjoy, without abandon. This is the best fried/maple glazed/meaty food you can get."}
{"text":"The end of an era. It's sad to say, but now this place has lost its charm.   I've been a big fan for the past 6 years. But this was the most disappointing experience i've ever had... and i organized a trip of 20 including friends from around the world.   Everything was wrong this year. The tables were sticky. The service was terrible - almost comparable to a self serve cafeteria. The flavours were strange - a little too out there to even work. Dishes with too many competing flavours. Seemed like the dishes were simply conceived to make an outrageous point rather than a cohesive dining experience. Dishes were also hard to eat. The slight deviation towards more international flavours didn't work either this year. The quality of produce wasn't there surprisingly. The menu itself seemed rather lessened compared to previous years - i.e less of everything and all the good stuff that APDC is known for.   I wanted to keep these thoughts to myself, for respect to Martin Piccard, but the entire group felt the same way... and especially for those of us that do this annually, we all noticed the differences. It's sad to even think of this - the truth is this isn't an off year in our opinion - when you look at it over the years - the increased number of services days and services within the days itself has now taken it's toll on the restaurant - there is less love and more factory output - and this is just a result of popularity and a busy chef. C'est la vie."}

{"text":"We visited here in Montreal.  It's not too far walk from a Metro stop, and easy to walk right by.     Pros:  the food.  I had the salad as a starter.  It has a wonderful light erasing with slivers of Apple and crumbles of Brie and blue cheese.  My husband had the foie gras pancake with maple syrup.  He though the savory and sweet flavors were wonderful.  For the main I had the pork chop (gluten free) and it was amazing with every bite.  My husband had the rabbit meatloaf, very rich.   For dessert the maple syrup cake.  Cons:  the atmosphere is not conducive to conversation.  Loud, loud, loud!  My ears were ringing when I came outside.  The tables are squeezed in tightly and not comfortable.  The kitchen area is directly behind the bar and it is loud and chaotic.  The waitstaff runs up and down the narrow aisle next to you.  The waitstaff was distracted.  We had five different staff members wait on us at any given time.  Confusing.  They are dressed very informally so you cannot tell if they are a guest or waitstaff."}
{"text":"A foodie's dream come true. What a memorable and delicious experience we had! If you love foie gras, pig, and rich filling food, this is the place to come. But DO come hungry! We started out with the Foie Gras Cromesquis which were croquettes filled with a lava explosion of liquid foie gras. Could have used a bit more seasoning and maybe some parsley to brighten the flavors. I don't think I would get it again next time around. For the main entree, I got the Stuffed Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras. This was THE star of the meal. It came out in this big baking dish that was fit for a king. The pied du cochon was cooked perfectly and tasted heavenly. There was a nice crispy crust on it and this pied was placed lovingly in a platter full of mushrooms and cream and lots of pieces of foie gras. Even though I barely finished half of this, I felt it was totally worth it and extremely glad I ordered it. I recommend sharing this platter if you're not famished. Last, but not least, since we were both full from our main course, me and my partner both shared the Maple Poudding ChÃ´meur. This was the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance! Simple dessert yet oh so mouth-wateringly delicious!   Besides the amazing food, the service from the staff was right on par. We got seated right by where the servers got the food from the cooks. The staff here work hard and I felt there was a nice team effort going on. They were all very attentive to our needs and made sure we had a pleasant experience.   Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant if you're ever in Montreal. I will definitely come here again next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I would probably not return here.  my duck in can was average; it was mushy and flavors were muddled.  My appetizer of flash fired zucchini flowers was excellent.  I love foie gras but there in only so much a person would want so i thought the variety of choices was too limited for me. it was an experience thou."}
{"text":"Thank you, Anthony Bourdain for introducing this wonderful place.  Thank you, hostess of this restaurant, who was not only very helpful, kind, and sweet, but she even satisfied my curiosity about that gentleman who looked very familiar to me, like he was in a couple of movies we all watched. At the end he was a Hollywood actor.  Thank you, Chef! We decided that we wanted to follow Maestro's suggestions. It was an unforgettable experience. I still remember all the flavors and the presentation.   Do go there and enjoy every bite of every dish you order, you will not regret it!  Bravo, Chef!  P.S. In this restaurant I truly experienced what good food means. It dissolves all borders and there is only one thing remains, language of a good, hearty, and tasty food. There were a lot of people from New York, local folks, and the family from Maine, we took an elevator together in the hotel we stayed,  they had a reservation in the same restaurant,  same evening that we had ours.  Good food speaks for itself!"}
{"text":"My oh my! Dinner at Au Pied de Cochon was one of the tastiest meals I've had in awhile. Their house dish, Pied de Cochon was spectacular! The skin of the roasted pork underneath that gravy... Superb! It was so delicious and the flavors really complex. French Onion soup is a must here as well as the Apple, Bleu cheese & Endive salad. The soup was well made - not overly salty and made from scratch (the way it should be). We added 100g foie gras which elevated the dish to another level of decadence!  Foie Poutine was the dish to catch my attention on Yelp. But unfortunately, it was the most forgettable dish of the night - What Poutine? Another dish that fell short from hitting the mark was Duck in a Can. My gosh, this dish was super salty! Aside from the saltiness, I just don't remember anything about the Duck in a Can.   There is a cocktail made with fresh squeezed orange juice - get it! This drink was the most amazing cocktail I've ever had.   Service here is great :) Very friendly staff that is attentive, talkative but not overbearing."}
{"text":"One of the best cuisines and friendly places in Montreal. Go with the signature dishes and prepare for culinary precision and great homely atmosphere! The staff are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Probably tried this place about 10 years too late, but I wanted to go and we had a pretty good meal here. The highlights of the meal were the Okonomiyaki and the Halibut special, with the Okonomiyaki really impressing us. The venison tartare hand roll, a less successful play on Japanese food, was just ok. We also tried the Ham on a Shack app. This was fun for the little one as they cut the ham in front of us, but despite that pure beauty of a leg of ham it was not cut properly and just didn't do it for us. But the little fried donuts that came with it were awesome. The only real dud for us was the Duck in a Can. Ironically, I loved everything but the duck. Everything in the can was nice and braised and the flavors were solid, but the duck was way under cooked compared to the rest of the dish. We basically left the whole breast there and I ate everything else in the can. Overall, was glad to have tried this place, but we didn't love it. Prolly should have had something that came directly from that gorgeous oven!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from New York City to try this restaurant because Anthony Boudain was here.. It is definitely worth the drive. The waitress was excellent, she was very thorough with the menu it's impressive that she remembered everything on it.  I love Foie Gras, so I was in heaven!!..every dish had Foie Gras... LOVE LOVE LOVE"}
{"text":"Amazing...  Loved the atmosphere; lively with out being too loud, solid service, unpretentious.  Food was excellent!  Amazingly fresh seafood with oysters prepared in ways I had never experienced before such as fresh cream sauce.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the foie gras poutine was decadent.  Novelty sure, but just the idea is exciting.  The equivalent to caviar nachos perhaps, but better pairing.  Finally, duck in a can.  More foie gras, in a reduced balsamic vinaigrette.  Once again, delightful.  The recommended wine pairing for the seafood was perfect; the red for the main course was a little too spicy for my taste with something as rich as foie gras.  Will definitely come back here again next time I am in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Over Labor Day weekend I was in Montreal visiting a friend who insisted if I wanted to taste the best the city has to offer we needed to eat at Au Pied de Cochon.   After making reservations nearly two months in advance, last Saturday night we went for dinner.  The restaurant is sparsely decorated with hardwood floors, plain tables, and an open kitchen.  It is clear that the main focus at Au Pied is not the decor, but the food.  For starters we enjoyed the Foie Gras Cromesquis.  These tasty fried cubes of liquefied foie gras explode in your mouth the instant they are bitten into releasing way more flavor than can be imagined.  Next my friend and I both chose the Bison Tartare as an appetizer.  Served in the bowl it was prepared in, the bison meat is mixed with onions and a minimal amount of spices and comes with half a quail egg for the dinner to mix into the meat.  The preparation is simple, but it really allows all the flavor to come out.  For an entree my friend insisted I try the Duck in a Can.  At first this sounded odd, but after our server explained the preparation I was sold.  The meal includes a large portion of foie gras, duck meat, as well as a good helping of duck fat.  Since the meal is stored in the can before it is served, all the flavors melt together into one incredibly rich dish.  For dessert, we shared a blueberry pie for two.  The crust was layered with an almond paste, fresh Canadian blueberries, and topped with a thin layer of crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.  With all these ingredients I assumed the dessert would be heavy, but it was surprisingly airy without losing any of the flavor.  One of the best parts of the experience was our server.  He answered any and all of our questions, and we could tell he was excited and passionate about the food.  Overall, I'd have to say that my meal at Au Pied de Cochon was one of the best meals I've had in a long while."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, I forget the name of the appetizer we had, but my duck fat fries and Duck Magret in Mushroom Sauce  was really yummy, The meat was tender and juicy, and the flavors really superb too. We finished the dinner off with french vanilla ice cream :) The ambiance and the service were great too. The place is definitely a must-try"}
{"text":"Our reservation was at 9:30pm, we were seated close to 9:30 and had to wait a little bit because the place was packed, plus there were line out the door.  Here's how the rest of the night goes:  Deep Fried Foie Gras Liquid (Explosion in your mouth): this was a nice teaser of what you're going to get. This little thing is the epitome of short sweet and meaningful.  Foie Gras de Champlain: this course was good. Can I say that it was really good? maybe not because if you try Liverpool house similar dish of foie w/ some sort of pancake/toasted english muffin, bacon infused maple syrup, bacon, fried egg. I think Liverpool's was much better. I would still recommend to try this one though.  PDC w/ Foie: by this time, I didn't even touch the foie gras that comes with the pig's feet. I think that the dish could serve three people. My wife and I could not even finish the whole damn thing. It was delicious, rich, fatty, gelatinous, crispy and rich. True epitome of gluttony!  You need to come with empty stomach, big appetite, and get ready for a night of gluttony @ PDC...  It was worth the wait and a must try restaurant when you're in Montreal, QC."}
{"text":"This place, guys. This place. Quite possibly the best food i've ever had, and none of it was things I would usually order. Don't pick for yourself, just ask your server. They KNOW what genius they are serving and will take good care of you. We asked, and ended up getting something that wasn't even on the menu and was prepared table-side; a foie gras and mushroom risotto prepared in a parmesean cheese wheel. It was rich and delicious and enough food for 4 people! (not that we'd have shared....)   We forgot to make our reservation before travelling to Montreal, so I was sure we wouldn't get in. They said they could fit us in at 11:30 pm. That's REALLY late for dinner, we thought, but when were we going to be in Montreal again? This and Joe Beef (which was closed for construction) were at the top of our list. So- we took the reservation. Just a warning- there are almost not bars on the street that this restaurant is on, so if you arrive early for your reservation planning on bar hopping, you'll be out of luck like we were. We ended up checking in an hour early, and they actually got us in by 10:45. The next hour was truly remarkable, and one of our best experiences in Montreal.   (My *only* complaint was that the creme brulee was a bit charred, and the top was not warm. It was definitely prepared ahead of time and whoever fired the top was in a hurry. Totally understandable, and a very minor complaint, but at this level of Fantastic it's worth mentioning.)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best poutine in all of Quebec.  My husband and I also ordered the pigs feet to share (we didn't come close to finishing it as the portion was huge!).  I recommend going here on a low-key night as you will leave feeling like you ate a thanksgiving feast. Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Make reservations! Either call/email or reserve online. It's a must. Also come hungry, because, they serve a lot of food.  This place gets super packed during the dinner rush. Even dining at the counter gets full.  I'd recommend the foie gras duo to get the best out of APC. If you're dining with friends, then I'm sure you can taste each other's food. But for a single diner like myself, the foie gras duo comes with Foie Gras burger and foie gras poutine fries. Huge portions for about $50. Very fatty, very rich, and very good.  I started off with the tuna tartare as an appetizer, but even though it is a small portion, I couldn't get through my foie gras duo because of the enormity of the portions. The tuna tartare was tarty and fresh.  And I still wanted dessert after and I chose the toffee maple milk shake. They made it right in front me...I guess because I was in the counter, but you can see all the fatty goodness when they make this. Not to sweet, but I had enough room to finish it. I would order this again.  Trying to find street parking might be hard for you during dinner time. And the metro station is several blocks away. You can probably try the bixi bikes if you have time to roam around this part of the Montreal neighborhood."}
{"text":"I book trips to Montreal solely on my ability to get a reservation at this place.   Being from Vancouver, living in LA, Chicago, near NYC you get exposed to a lot of great food. Au Pied de Cochon is easily my favorite restaurant in North America, if not the world. The dishes are just so inventive, and crazy, like mad-scientist-chef crazy. Who puts a lobster inside the mouth of a roasted pig head? Chef Picard! That's who!   This place is worth the hype. Everything I've gotten here is simply immensely flavorful and decadent. I was here by myself (the wifey is scared of this place) last weekend and the amount of food for the price is insane. A salmon head appetizer was only $5 CAD, and their poutine (even without the foie) might even be better than the venerable La Banquise.  Just come here. Fly, drive, get a hotel, AirBnb it, Uber it, Metro it. Just do it. Please."}
{"text":"I went back to Montreal in July with my wife, mostly just to eat here. I couldnt get reservations and was heart broken, we went out to Mont Royal and it was bit late and after a few drinks we were hungry and happened to be in the area and I asked the hostess and was lucky to score a table. The house beer was fantastic and the charcuterie plate that Martin cures out at the Cabine Sucre was as good as anything I had in Spain. Proscuitto, guanciole and lardo (sala) with garlic toast, gerkins and mustard was to die for.  I had the buffalo rib in a beer reduction with was fall off the bone tender served with dijon accented mashed potatoes a cousa squash pure served in the squash and also fresh baby carrots and snow peas from the marche jean talon. My wife had the gnocchis(lite and heavily)  with bacon and peas with was then tossed table side in a PARMESAN WHEEL !!!a technique I never saw outside of Italy. My wife said I looked like a kid in a candy store. I love this place and will back."}
{"text":"Heard so many great things about this place so I knew I had to try it when I was visiting Montreal for the long weekend. The restaurant atmosphere and service was fantastic. The food was good, really good.. although I admit I may have walked in with overly high expectations. To start, I ordered the Cromesquis de Foie Gras which came with two bite-sized pieces. The batter was perfectly crispy with the foie gras filling a smooth creamy texture. My initial thoughts were that the size was smaller than expected, however after eating the entire piece in one bite as per what the server suggested, I realized it was the perfect size. Anything larger and the filling to batter ratio would have been offset.   Then came our foie gras poutine. This dish was all sorts of goodness. There was definitely a generous serving of foie gras in this dish and it tasted really good but I feel that some acidity to cut the fat would have made the flavours more balanced. Each bite was super creamy and salty (not a bad thing at all) but after half the poutine I felt that I needed a week-long cleanse. Totally worth it though.   The last dish that we ordered was of course the Duck in a Can. I appreciate the innovation behind this dish as I have not heard nor seen a dish that is even remotely similar to this technique. The waiter explained that the ingredients are all cooked inside of the can for 40 minutes. Pretty cool. The contents of the can was then poured over a crispy crostini with carrot purÃ©e. I loved crostini as it added more texture to the dish. However I felt that was flavour of the broth/sauce in which the duck was cooked in quite one-dimensional. It reminded me of a stew with a bunch of different ingredients and soggy vegetables. This is not a bad thing, in fact the overall dish was quite yummy but I can't say it met my expectations especially after hearing so many people rave about this dish. I felt that the fat on the duck breast needed to be rendered down a lot more and I ended up just avoiding the skin all together. Portion wise, it was the perfect amount of food for a main course if shared with another person.   Overall I found that this restaurant was a good experience and would recommend it to those looking for innovative dishes and a unique dining experience. I am curious about what else they offer and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Somehow, we managed to squeeze ten people around a table that's probably meant for eight. They were super-nice about trying to get us all comfortably put at our table. We fit at the table a lot better before the meal than after the meal.  The menu is minimalist. It basically reads like \"duck, pig, duck, seafood\" without mention of sides or prep. Between the internet and accommodating servers, though, you can figure out what makes sense for you.  Ironically, I ordered no pork. With ten at the table, I figured I'd be able to snack on others' pork (which was true -- I had my fair share of feet). I got:  -- hen liver terrine: so smooth and rich, with nice sides of picked onion and fruity compote. -- duck carpaccio: came with paper thin slices of mushrooms and an egg yolk. perfectly balanced and creamy. I just slurped it up on the endless supply of slices of the hearty bread. -- foie gras poutine: i would've preferred more fries to balance out the amount of other richness. i almost ordered another side of fries to dump in, but realized that i might die of richness if i did so.  i also tried the duck with mushroom sauce and aforementioned pied, both of which were great. It took so long to get the bill that i was getting a little nauseous from fullness and the meaty smell that pervaded everything, but i made it out alive.  giant mirrors help you stalk the bathrooms (one on each side of the bar) so you can catch someone coming out and jump in. one bathroom has a tv mounted at eye level (i watched a bit of hockey) and the other has a giant trough sink. random.  so yeah - try it. bring a group so you can sample lots of stuff. don't be afraid to ask questions. wear stretchy pants."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant for all things foie gras.   We ordered poutine au foie gras, the ham dish on their specials, and the foie gras pasta of the day. The poutine with foie gras was probably my favorite. The crispiness of the potatoes and cheese curds were a great complement to the heavier foie gras and gravy. The ham dish, which featured thinly sliced iberian ham topped with a sweet maple syrup and accompanied by a side of beignets, was also a standout dish for its uniqueness and unexpected combination of flavors. The sweet and savory worked so well together.   I was a little bit disappointed with the foie gras pasta. It was very cool to see it being made table side within a giant cheese wheel, but the pasta came out kinda cold. The portion was also very small. The texture of the pasta was tad bit too al dente for my taste. However, the foie gras mixed into the sauce tasted amazing.   I think this restaurant is a great value (especially if you're coming from the US) for all the foie gras you get. A must try if you're visiting Montreal. Make rezzies ahead of time to avoid the wait!  Food: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5 Value: 4/5 Ambiance:4/5"}
{"text":"Just not our kind of place. Extremely loud. Staff was incredibly friendly. We just don't eat the amounts or types of food served here. Went because we were given gift certificates."}
{"text":"The foie gras was delicious, although on the salty side. Duck in a can was okay but the sauce was lacking. Lamb was easily forgettable. Tuna was fine, but the lobster roll was best. Creme brulee was extremely burnt and disappointing.  Come here with a party so you can do family style."}
{"text":"We went here because it was close and listed as being Canadian. Here at Yelp it is listed as French so I assume it is French with a Canadian accent. It is all impossibly delicious! I like how people I communicate with on Yelp from NY and NJ go to the same places I go in other cities and countries. We had all Duck entrees and apps. It is very filling and very rich! Anthony Bourdain recommends it so I knew it had to be good. Anthony Bourdain gained my respect only after he went to Hawaii. It was only  then that  I knew he knew food. (the Hawaii show of Anthony Bourdain is on the Travel Channel right now.)  Meats are roasted to the point of falling off the bone in the brick oven.  chef Martin Picard gets  creative with one menu item that is the most abundant menu item : foie gras. It comes in 10 combination's, including as a tart, with poutine, and in a quirky  creation called Duck in a Can which does come in a can  (see picture) , it comes to the table with a can opener. All of the food is rich and unique. If you are in Montreal you must eat here, period! 5 stars for being unique!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best meal I have ever eaten.  And I don't use that statement lightly.  With praise from far and wide, Au Pied de Cochon is one of those rare eateries that truly lives up to every expectation and accolade.  Everything was rich, savory, plentiful, and incredibly flavorful.  After being promptly seated at our reservation time and having our helpful waiter decipher the menu for us, we decided upon three classic dishes: the foie gras poutine, the duck in a can, and the PDC Melting Pot.  First, the foie gras poutine is life changing.  Everything: the sumptuous gravy, the fries, the slightly salty melty cheese, and the richly velvety foie gras, was cooked to perfection and melded together beautifully.  It was unlike any flavor combination I've ever had and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  The duck in a can was also terrific.  Part presentation, part flavor and food, this dish sung on so many levels: juicy duck, foie gras, vegetables, gravy, potatoes, everything.  It was so rich and savory, perfect for a cold winter night.  And the melting pot gave us a taste of all that PDC can do with pork: sausages, belly, and chop, served over mashed potatoes with two large pearl onions.  I couldn't have asked for a heartier, richer, more solidly delicious meal.  And lastly, when we wanted some of their maple toffee sprinkled over a bowl of plain ol' vanilla ice cream, they gladly obliged.  Bonus points for outstanding service!  This is not a meal for the faint of heart, your vegetarian friends, or those looking for a light supper.  This is meal that celebrates meat in all of its glorious forms.  It is a meal that you will remember and talk about for a long time.  In short, a definite must on any visit to Montreal, and well worth the coin."}
{"text":"I don't know how I'm just now rating this place but it's one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. My fiancÃ© and I came here on our last night in Montreal on vacation. Everything we ate was incredible but the star was the foie gras nigiri - an appetizer I would usually not order but it was incredible. The service was amazing, the bathroom is even cool... just go here."}
{"text":"A) You need reservations here B) You need to like Foie Gras C) Portions are big...you need less food then you think D) The Bison Ribs were tasty...but...not as tender as they should have been and ENORMOUSNESS"}
{"text":"For the foodie with fearless arteries and a fondness for foie gras in everything except -- thankfully -- the water. The open kitchen is better than anything on television. The night I went, a bilingual woman expertly ran the kitchen while dressing plate after plate of heavy comfort food. Bring a hungry crowd to attempt the whole pied de cochon and try to squeeze some foie gras poutine (the national dish of Canada, comprising cheese curds, fries/chips and gravy) into that full stomach. Bison tongue with tarragon is recommended."}
{"text":"Plan in advance and make your reservation early! The place is packed and there's no way you'd get seated without one. This was definitely one of the most memorable meals of our recent trip to Montreal. Even though we couldnt try everything on the menu, it was nice to see the dishes our neighboring tables ordered.   My husband and I ordered: - Pate de campagne: great to start off the meal. Fresh, definitely sparked my appetite for more. - Duck in a can: So yummy!!!! Everyone says it's worth getting- and IT IS! Just get it. It's not like anything you'll get anywhere else. Super juicy and the meat just falls off the bone. And oh yea, there's a big chunk of foie gras in there too. Weird to think something cooked in a tin can could be so special, but it is. - PDC Melting Pot: Very tasty and fun to get a sample of different meats, including blood sausage.   We also loved the relaxed atmosphere- no need to dress up because it's not one of those foofy stuck-up places. The store front is completely open, so it's almost like eating outdoors if you're seated by the front. The space is pretty tight- we kept joking that being skinny must be a requirement to be a waiter there. Service is kind of slow. We were there for over 2 hours, but we didn't mind because we were there to relax and enjoy our dinner. No one rushed us out the door despite it being so crowded. Our main waiter was really nice and friendly, however the people bringing our food to the table weren't the best. We found a hair in our pate and asked for a new one, and judging by the reaction, you'd think WE did something wrong! No apology- he just took it away and brought us a new one. Not a big deal, but you'd think for the amount you're spending, a little customer service would be nice when we find hair in our food.   Overall, a great experience and definitely worth a trip to. Keep in mind they are closed Sundays and Mondays when making your reservations....so plan around it! It's worth it."}
{"text":"Had the foie gras putin and the duck in a can. Everything was great. So good!!! Still think a chinese duck is more fluffier and tender with crispy skin. I know it's 2 different ways/styles of cooking but i Would like to try replacing the duck in a can with the chinese duck. With all the flavors going on in that can and the crispy skin and tender meat would blow my mind, I think."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been dreaming of coming here ever since we saw this restaurant on Anthony Bourdain's show. We ventured to Montreal at the end of November, ready to brave the cold because we knew this type of food would be best in cold weather. We made reservations for Thursday (American Thanksgiving) and we were super excited to finally experience a meal here. We arrived a little early, but they seated us right away. Then they brought us the delicious warm bread and butter. I was already happy, but my husband reminded me not to gorge myself until our food arrived.  We decided to order the fried goie gras appetizer. We also had to order the foie gras poutine. Then we had the melting pot (pork belly and sausages), as well as the stuffed pig foot with foie gras.   Everything was AMAZING so delicious. That gravy on the poutine was a revelation and then with those generous hunks of foie gras. Amazing. I though the melting pot was big but then the stuffed pig foot came out in a huge casserole dish (like the type of dish that would feed a family of 6). So much food. Our waiter kind of warned us it would be a lot of food but we were shocked by how much food it was. Everything was delicious. We also ordered a bottle of wine to wash it all down. I was pretty full after the poutine and only had a few bites of the pig food as well as some of the sausage. My husband rallied and kept eating. Then when our waiter asked if we'd like dessert, we both felt pretty full but when we saw the \"sugar pie for 2\" we figured that we'd come all this way, we better do it up right. That sugar pie was heavenly. It also came with some of the most delicious ice cream. I wish I had some of that pie right now. I think we were clearly stuffed and about to pass out from being so full, so our waiter brought over a bottle of calvados and made us do a shot with him so we wouldn't pass out. It was a very kind gesture and we appreciated it. Anyways, we had an amazing time and it was worth it. We felt too sad to leave our leftovers there, so we carried them all the way back to our hotel even though we didn't have a chance to eat them..."}
{"text":"Waited almost two weeks to get there. Well, it must be the type of food they serve. It is definitely not the most exquisite stuff you get in haute cuisine places, but rather very hearty down-to-earth kind of food. Very good, very tasty. So if you want some simple french cuisine, this is the place to go. It can get crowded so hurry up to make a reservation. One tip, I went there with my friends who live in Montreal and they were not that impressed at all. They even didn't know that it existed. Conclusion, for locals, it's a typical restaurant, Old Port seems to have better places. Anyway, solid, and must be touristy hence the hype, good for bucket list."}
{"text":"All I have to say is : Poutine au foie gras!!! AND don't come here if you are worried about calories. Leave the seats for people who want to eat. There are lines and I recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place for my birthday for awhile. I wanted to like it. It started badly. We were stuck in traffic and were half and hour late. I called them several times and they never answered but left a message. (Just reserving for this place is not easy. They never answer and they call you back to let you know if they have place a few days later) anyway, when we got to the restaurant they had given up our spot. After telling them it was birthday they managed to squeeze us in a spot after waiting another half an hour. The ambiance had a sugar shack feel. Including sitting very close to others. There is not much room in between tables. My husband had the foie gras poutine and I had the duck carpaccio. They were both great but he said his was very rich. I loved my plate as it was light. I also tried the bite sized foie which was wonderful. I then ordered a stew with porc and potatoe gratin on top. He has the \"meat plate\" to be honest both were too heavy. The food is prepared well but leaving here you almost fall into a food coma right away. In my opinion overhyped and pricey. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was superior in every way. The place was absolutely packed, but we were seated on time, at a table with a good view of the kitchen.   Let me say a word about the kitchen, because this one was fantastic. There were two sous chefs floating around, and a number of line cooks, and it was like watching a symphony. Everybody knew their jobs, there was little to no verbal communication, no wasted movements, no drama. It was a treat to watch real pros do their jobs. One of the sous chefs, Emily, especially  brought a real sense of joie de vivre to the kitchen.  The service here was very professional. Attentive, helpful, not at all snobby or elitist, and also not  irritatingly fawning.   The food was fantastic. I had the duck in a can, which was heavy but a very well done dish. My wife had their fish special, which was excellent.  I waited a few weeks before writing this review, because we pretty much ate our way across New England and Montreal, and were eating well every night, and I wanted to wait before writing some of these reviews to gain some perspective. My wife and I discussed it over dinner last night -- for me this was the top meal of the trip, for her, second best after Street and Co in Portland, ME."}
{"text":"Oh My Goodness!!!!  I have tasted heaven.  My wife and I spent a few days in Montreal recently.  Whenever we go anywhere, we dine at all the best recommendations made to us by the concierge.  Every restaurant we ate at was fantastic.  Europea, l'Epicier, Milo's, etc... but Au Pied de Cochon is in a league of it's own.  This is some of the best food I've ever had... anywwhere... Miami, NY, Paris, Tokyo... anywhere. Their specialty is Foie Gras.  I like foie gras, but with other options on the menu, I usually go for something else.  However, this is not your ordinary Foie Gras.  We had the Foie Gras Poutine, which included potatos, gravy and cheese.  Wonderful... but nothing comparted to the one the server recommended to us, which was a spectacular blend of Foie Gras with canadian bacon, sour cream and cheese on a pancake, topped with maple syrup.  Holy Jesus!!!!!  When you put that in your mouth, prepare to be blown away.  What a combination of flavors.    I didn't think anything could beat that, and maybe it didn't, but the rest of the food was also amazing.  And finally, the dessert.  Wow.  I'm not a big pastry dessert guy.  These people know how to make a pastry.  We had an upside down creme brulee tart with berries.  That was simply one of the best, if not, the best dessert I've ever had.  To top it off, the bill was very reasonable.  It was actually the least expensive restaurant we tried during our entire stay in Montreal.  5 stars.  I'd give it 6 if I could."}
{"text":"Good service, delicious food.  Expensive !  Definitely try the ployes layered with cheese, potato,and fois gras with a drizzle of maple syrup.  Fun place to go enjoy all aspects of the pig and a wide variety of fois gras (fg) dishes."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal and well worth the long wait to get a reservation.   Anyone who rates this restaurant under 5 stars does not understand the concept -- over-the-top French-Canadian fare for a ridiculously fare rate. They should watch Anthony Bourdain's \"No Reservations\" Quebec episode to get an idea of what Martin Picard likes to serve. We paid $160 CAD for 2 meals (~14 courses each), which if you compare to tasting menu prices anywhere else is an absolute steal. I would highly recommend trying to get a larger group together, as the experience seems far more jolly with more people.   I only wish that I had trained beforehand to eat more! We will definitely be back as soon as we possibly can!"}
{"text":"I came to APDC with an open mind and wallet. I wanted to experience an extremely decadent Quebecois meal. I didn't eat very much the day of. But, I did order fries as a starter. That's a terrible choice. The portions are massive, even from a usually undefeatable appetite as mine. It wasn't the size of the meal (though it was monstrous) as much as the density of the entree that made the mere thought of consuming it repulsive.  Foie Cromesquis- I was unimpressed. The exterior was similar to the fried brading on a mozzarella stick. No special flavors to speak of. The inside of this bite-sized app I was hoping would really capture the essence of foie. It did not. The filling tasted mainly like french onion soup with a faint taste of foie. The texture was not particularly rich or decadent at all.  Fries- Also unimpressed. I was expecting rich duck fatty deliciousness. Their fries are pretty standard style. Think boardwalk style: deep fried with the skins still on, just slightly thinner. They were OK, but the entire time I was thinking that I could and have made fries of better quality. Nothing special.   Stuffed Au Pied de Cochon with Foie Gras- A ridiculously dense gut bomb of pork fattyness served over mashed potatoes with a porky demi-glaze with notes of red wine maybe. The dish was way too much food for me. But I'm fine with that. No harm there.   This dish was offensive to my pallete. It literally had large pieces of pork fat and skin in it. The sauce was so dense I wanted to vomit. The flavor profile was so dominated by the taste of fat that I felt like I was spooning up an oil spill. I'd like to see some balance to this dish with acids.  The execution of the pork itself was also questionable. The mouthfeel was OK, but it wasn't falling off the bone and flaky like some of the better pork tenderloin, shoulder, and ribs I've enjoyed elsewhere.   The Foie Gras was fairly mediocre. Really did not have the same butteriness or depth of flavor that I experienced the night before from Chef Sakurai at Toroli.   The service at APDC was excellent and all the staff were friendly and attentive. It was a fun environment with hip music and smiling people.   I'll probably come back at some point to give a few of the other dishes of Au Pied a try. But I won't expect as much as I did this time."}
{"text":"We showed up without a reservation on a Friday night and they got us a table! We had the temaki crevettes as a starter and then the Demi canard for our entree! We finished it off with their crime brÃ»lÃ©e and two scoops of their ice cream! It was a one of a kind restaurant! Everything was delicious and at the end of it all the manager checked us out and personally asked us how our dinner was! Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food lives up to the hype.  The fois gras poutine was the highlight of the meal, though the namesake meal (the au pied de cochon) was very good as well, and everyone in my party enjoyed the food.  We waited over a half an hour in spite of having a reservation, which is completely unacceptable for a restaurant of this price, and it was extremely noisy, but the food is good enough to recommend swinging by."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a gluttonous meal, Au Pied de Cochon fits the bill.  I think that I knocked several years off my life here.  We were a group of 11 and they handled us well.  I think we went through 11 bottles of wine and this on the heels of drinking rather heavily before.  I would describe the meal if I could, but I sort of was in a meat/wine/beer coma throughout.  Everything we ate was rich.  The duck in a can was a freaking duck in a can.  The place is lively and you will be packed into a tight seat.  Deal with it."}
{"text":"Ok, let's get one thing straight... you don't go to Pied De Cochon for healthy food. Not even healthy-ish. So this is why I was never gonna go here knowing that yes it will be really good but it will probably kill me.... But the morning of Anthony Bourdain passing, reading the news got me thinking it'd be nice to pay homage so I made a reservation.  I love the unpretentious way of this place. It was very easy-going. The staff is friendly & helpful.   The menu is foie gras dominant. We took a Plogue de Champlain, a Tarte de Boudin & Foie Gras, butter & herbs snails and a roasted veggies dish (yes, to balance it out, it was necessary)   Everything was delicious. I don't really know what else to say because I cannot defend the fat side of things and I expected it. Sometimes u just gotta sit back and enjoy it for what it is. Like Anthony Bourdain said: \"Your body is not a temple, it's an amusement park. Enjoy the ride\"  I can't say that I would come back here again volunterily, for the sake of my artery. I would go again though, with others who want to taste this food. If you haven't been, I definitely recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Come here when you are hankering for a truly decadent meal.  Au Pied De Cochon is one of those places that lives up to all your expectations and then some.  Right off the bat you can tell that it is all about the food. The atmosphere is bustling, cozy and nice, but no frills.  It took a while to decide on which items we would get but eventually we decided on two special appetizers:   -A salad with a poached egg on top and the best bacon I've ever had -A soft shell crab maki roll with foie gras (O.M.G. one of the best things I've ever eaten though it sounds crazy weird)  And the rest of this to split: -PDC seafood platter $50 level? (SO worth it, highly recommended! So much work goes into their raw seafood platters, it's not just raw oysters and clams. In addition, it came with escargot in a black bean sauce, conch, mussels with a nice tomato broth, fancy mini melon balls in the raw oysters, sea jelly?!? in some fancy oysters, calamari with delicious aoli, a skewer of lightly fried white fish, some truly amazing scallops.) -Lamb Shank (perfectly cooked, wanted more and more- huge portion!) -Foie gras tart with blood sausage (SO SO GOOD. light puff pastry topped with caramelized onions, creamy melt in your mouth foie gras, with bites of sausage. big enough to share for two!)  The bill with beers ended up being way cheaper than I thought I was going to spend going in.  The portions were generous and the quality of the food was tremendous.  I encourage trying anything on the foie gras menu because you probably won't find better preparations then here.  No wonder this is one of Anthony Bourdain's favorite spots. This will definitely be a part of any future trips to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Yeah,  the cuisine  is really good  but  I sort of got disappointed  because  there is just too much  hype  about this place  so unless  you  are stepping in Montreal's  best  restaurant,  you are sort of  guaranteed  to be disappointed.  Same  happened  to me because  I was expecting  the best  there is but got simply  a good restaurant.  The staff  was great though."}
{"text":"The first law of restaurants is that you should serve food.  Second law is that if you take reservations you should honor them.  Both laws broken = zero stars."}
{"text":"Very rich food. If you like your food too creamy or too buttery, then this is your type of food. Everything was just very heavy and I couldn't seem to finish the dish. The FG is actually not bad as this was my first time tasting it. Definitely not something I would typically eat but at least I tried it!   Plogue Champlain $29 Pork filet $30 Fg hamburger $39 Squash risotto $24 Fg poutine $24 Eel tart $14  The place was jam packed and there's absolutely no room to move if you're sitting on the outside of the table. Service is slow because of how busy it is. Might take you 10min to get the attention of a waitress and another 10 for the bill.   Overall definitely a place to try but not something I would do again as its not really my type of food fare."}
{"text":"Serious food lovers only apply!!! Au Pied the Cochon has become one of Montreal's most stapled institutions even though you'll need a car and one hour of travel to drive to due to it's remote location in the boonies.  You'll quickly realize this is a very much \"in demand\" location to discover some amazing food with very specific days in the year you'll need to log to online and book your food adventure. The entire season (consisting of several months) will be booked within the hour! So best of luck to you as your availability could be a random day in the season like a Monday night at 9 PM! Lastly, they have 2 seasons, one for Sugar Shack season and the other for Apple Season.  We went for the Sugar Shack experience that came up to about $70 +tax + tip per person. (alcoholic drinks not included) and we were very excited to discover what Au Pied de Cochon is all about!  The one thing you'll learn is that they don't maintain the same menu from season to season and try out a new \"theme\". My dining experience was Moroccan themed. This means the pictures/experiences you'll read and see from prior years become quickly obsolete as the food items will no longer exist unless you experience the food within the same season.  The Moroccan menu consisted about a dozen plates and as it was my first experience with Au Pied de Cochon it was kind of a mixed bag. Some plates were simply AMAZING, and some others were completely forgettable. Knowing full well most people leave STUFFED to the 9s, I paced myself opting to take some items away in my doggie bin and politely pushing away items I didn't care for away leaving space for \"what was to come\" but didn't end up coming....   Since you \"share\" the table, your portion per plate can be limited and thus the items I REALLY liked became a scarce commodity you barely had a chance to enjoy and some plates with plates I was neutral or disliked had plenty of leftovers. Ultimately, I left still feeling hungry. Imagine my luck!  Some plates were amazing, I really enjoyed the fois gras cake (served too early to be honest) as well as the sweet pork and granita ice shaving that came with our maple taffy. The 2 tablespoons of pudding chomeur was good but hey.... CAN I HAVE A REAL PORTION??? The rest of the menu was a mixed bag for me.  As a first experience, I can totally understand the hype. You don't see this being offered elsewhere and if you want a gastronomic artisanal sugar shack experience and budget isn't an issue, this is the place to try out, at least once. However, this may not be for everyone and now I understand when I had people experience this place before telling me they weren't a huge fan...I believe comes from having absolutely no control on what is being served at all. In my case, Moroccan menu for a cabane a sucre was a miss but I'd love to see what other seasons could represent.  Anyways, that's my take."}
{"text":"This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal!  (Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)  Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god! This is probably one of the best places in Montreal.   I started with the Foei Gras poutine and it is absolutely delicious. The flavors are rich and savoury. It is a bit expensive, but the portions are quite generous.  The next dish I got was Pied de Cochon farci au Foei Gras, which is Pig's feet stuffed with duck liver. You cant go wrong stuffing things with duck liver! Similar to every other dish, it was so rich, juicy and flavorful.    Really great experience. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had 4 courses, 3 of which were foie, which is 10 stars in my book. Didn't love the duck in a can, and found it a little chewy. The true star were the Foie Gras Cromesquis which may have been the best bite of food to ever grace my tastebuds.   I definitely loved sitting at the bar and would choose that over a table any day."}
{"text":"I came to this place because of the Anthony Bourdain episode, Uber driver recommendation, and trip advisor forum post saying this place has this place has a decadent foie gras menu.  What I got was plate after plate of oil and grease with nothing to make the food edible. I even asked waiter if there were something light and he basically drew a blank.  Lightest thing they got was just a whole roast duck but meh.  Not what we came here for and that's not really light fare anyway.   Foie gras nigiri (sushi) was just a slice of foie gras on rice on spoons. They used some kind of sesame oil/paste instead of wasabi and served it with ponzu sauce.  Yes, it was as uninspired and greasy sweet as it sounds.  It's not awful if you happened to like the condiments but the subtle foie gras sweetness was all gone.  It just wasn't very tasty.  The carpaccio just had way too much oil. I thought it was just greasy and bland and my wife found it inedible until she put it on the bread. Even then she thought she might as well just dipped the bread in olive oil.  The bread was served hot and tasted okay, once you get rid of the crust that was just too thick.  The PDC with foie gras was just gross.  It's a big pig feet with a block of foie gras on top. It was blandly seasoned so the fat from the pig foot itself was just sickly, which was made only worse by the foie gras.  The crispy skin on the pig foot was so thick we couldn't cut it with a butcher carving knife.  It was basically carbonized and mostly inedible. It was basically a horrible rendition of Ecuadorian (or some other Latin America country) roast pork that was over roasted and under seasoned.  I almost rated the place 1 star but I usually reserve 1 star for restaurants with basically no redeeming value. The foie gras nigiri wasn't great but it was pleasant for me since I liked the condiments and foie gras to begin with. The bread was warm and tasted fine with butter, once you removed some of the crust.  The entire PDC pig foot did have small bits of good meat (like 10% of it). The service was friendly and prompt.  But still, the food was uninspired and poorly executed. If you travel, just don't come here. If you don't, well, maybe this is the only place this indulgent in all of Montreal."}
{"text":"Completely lived up to the reputation. Knowledgeable, warm and relaxed service and delicious, robust food. Go hungry, and eat and drink your face off.  Recommend the PDC salad, their version of a \"green salad\" with chicken livers, hearts etc. And the duck in a can, FG poutine of course.  This place is the absolute bollocks!"}
{"text":"Not sure what went wrong...maybe all these stellar reviews got my expectations too high. Came in on Tuesday night without reservations, but was able to get seated at the bar within minutes. The bartender was very friendly and patiently answered my questions. I ended up getting the PDC salad, which was various pork bits sprinkled on salad greens. It also came with a square of fried pork knuckles & marrow & other goodness with a smear of spicy mustard. While the salad was nice & fresh, I think the choice of greens was too soft to stand up to the heavy pork bits. The pork was nicely flavored and tender. Didn't really like the fried pork knuckles though. Since I wasn't too hungry I ordered a foie gras tart rather than one of the meat dishes. Maybe that was my downfall. The tart was basically puff pastry with garlic mashed potatoes and slices of foie gras. I found it too greasy for my liking and the foie gras had none of the rich complex flavors I was expecting. Sadly this was a disappointment for me. And if you go, don't wear anything you can't wash, because you'll come out smelling like fried pig fat (not necessarily an offensive smell, but something to keep in mind...)."}
{"text":"We had been hearing about Au pied de cochon all week as THE place for Montreal food.  It has a great atmosphere, although whenever I see tanks of lobster crawling all over each other I feel a bit sad (I'm a self-loathing omnivore).  Perhaps we were too full of rich food from the previous evenings to enjoy it but here's what I learned about myself at APC:  For me, there is such a thing as too much foie gras.  One serving of poutine a day is all I can take.  I don't like blood pudding.  Still, I would love to return to APC on a lighter stomach and try it again, including the seafood platters, which looked great.  The foie gras poutine at the next table looked delicious."}
{"text":"The epitome of French food.   This is a must must must must see.    I had the Fois Gras poutine. Very good balance. Dont expect a huge quebec style poutine. Expect a balance of fois gras and fries.   Then the most amazing Tagliatelle i've had. Rustic cut with Rabbit and Fois Gras. With shaved cheese on top. If you want delicious, if you want decedant.....just wow.   The only problem i had was that they have SO many specials for the night that were told orally by the waiter that it was hard to follow. The waiter was so nice. We were from Toronto and he was welcoming and very polite and patient.    OH and fresh baked bread!!"}
{"text":"Beyond tasty. Every bit of food you put into your mouth will be enjoyable. Seriously scrumptious but not a place for those watching their waistlines. Everything is decadent and rich, but in the right ways. Service is great and they always have interesting specials."}
{"text":"It is no surprise this is one of the best restaurants in town. I went with 4 other friends visiting and we had an outstanding experience. We shared all the food we ordered. We started with Plogue Ã¡ Champlain, it is a layer of foie gras on top of cheese, ham and potato with a maple syrup sauce. It is very rich with a mix of sweet and salty. We ordered the mussels for appetizers too and they were on point, cooked really well and the blue cheese sauce was perfect. A bit rich but not too over powering. For the main dishes, we had the pork chops from the cabane a sucre, lobster dumplings, calamari pasta and beef osso bucco with a side of pasta. My favorite was the beef osso bucco, the meat was so tender and flavorful, the side pasta was in this stew like sauce with sausage and ricotta cheese. The lobster dumplings were my second favorite. Make sure you make a reservation before going as it is always busy."}
{"text":"For people who doesnt want to read the whole thing: Service 10/10 Food: 10/10 Decoration: 8/10 Expect: 50 $ per person if you don't drink alcool. If you drink, 100-125$ per person. Reservation: Almost Mandatory Lot of classic and must-eat   One of the best table of Montreal. Lot of local Plateau's celebrity goes there. The ambiance is really good. Yes it is expensive but there is nothing that will compare the quality of the products you will enjoy there for the price you're paying. Been there 3 times and I try to go every 9-12 mths because it is indeed, really rich. The biggest and most important thing before going there is to HAVE A RESERVATION! No way you can get there and not wait at least 1-2 hours before you can get a place. Even with reservation it's still long. Last time I went, i waited 30-40 minutes and enjoyed a free drink, so no rush, enjoy the free drink and wait because it's worth it.   The service is impeccable. Relax and professional the staff is experienced and knows their stuff. The last time I went there, the waiter was kind enough to have an half portion in EntrÃ©es of Poutine au Foie Gras saving us money and letting us enjoying the plate.Also the wine we ordered was missing and the waited came back with 2 choices within the same price so no scam on trying to sell you the really expensive winne.  Also offer an improvised menu not on the menu; CÃ´te de Boeuf croustillant avec sauce aux fruit sauvages. English: Crispy Beef Ribs with a wild fruits sauce (which was actually a rÃ©duction of beef fond with some chicoutai and wild fruits. Really Good! One must as an EntrÃ©e is the PDC Crusty salade: Salade aux Croustillant PDC. One weird but excellent thing (as well as the cheapest on the menu main course) the Fish N Chip served the old fashioned way. Cooked in Duck fat (like everything there) the Â«crispynessÂ» of the fish N chip was amazingly good.   I'd suggest everyone with place to try a CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lÃ©e which is obsviously made with real vanilla and therefore really tasty. The Chocolat Mousse also!!   Be cautious on one thing: The EntrÃ©e (some of them at the very least) for someone with a small apetite can be considerate as large."}
{"text":"Decent food, almost unnecessarily decadent? We had the foie gras poutine, duck magret and side of vegetables. The table next to us had their duck magret with sauce on the side, I feel like we should have followed as the sauce was too sweet with the mountain of caramelized onion that overwhelmed the mushrooms in the sauce and the perfectly cooked duck. The vegetable was asparagus, charred and seasoned to perfection, but the cheese on top is total overkill and did nothing. Once the asparagus and the duck got cold (we sat by the window on a hot June evening), the cheese slide right off in a gross lump and the sweet of the duck sauce became unbearable. I have a strong feeling this food will be much more appreciated in the Arctic MontrÃ©al winter rather than a summer evening"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5 This place is located at Rue Saint-Denis and Rue Rachel E. Free street parking was available when we went there on Sunday night at approx. 9PM.   [SERVICE] - 5/5 Our server was very friendly and personable. She helped us out with the menu and recommended several of their signature items.   [DÃCOR] - 4/5  Traditional and iconic Montreal vibes. At one point, the place got very warm and smoky because of the oven(s).   [QUALITY] - 5/5 The food was the pinnacle of fine dining in Montreal with high-quality ingredients and complex flavours in each dish.   [ORDER] - 4/5 - Plogue a Champlain - $29.00: buckwheat pancake topped with cheese, potatoes, bacon, and fois grois. The dish was both sweet and savoury. Fois grois melted in my mouth. Portion was small so I had to savour each bite.    - Duck in a Can - $44.00: came with an actual can and is heated with boiling water. The duck was very fatty and tender, and accompanied with cabbage.   - Pig's Head - $120.00: the star of our meal! Our server informed us that this would take quite a while to prepare (approx. 45 mins) which is why she recommended we enjoyed other dishes in the meantime. Every single part of the head was edible (except the bones and teeth). The skin was crispy, and every bite of meat was a melt-in-my-mouth experience. The head was stuffed with the most tender octopus tentacles, bison meat, and came with a side of squid ink risotto and spinach.   [OVERALL] - 4/5  All the dishes were very rich, fatty, and delicious. This type of food is a great treat once in a while, but I wouldn't eat this every day because I felt like all the fat was going to clog my arteries! Overall, I was glad I dined at one of the best traditional restaurants in QuÃ©bec."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate our birthdays and between the four of us we had the trout, scallops and pithivier. It was out of this world and tasted amazing! I'm 33 years old and during my time here on earth I can honestly say I have never ate anything so beautiful and magnificent, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff was very friendly in assisting us with any questions we may have had.   I'll let the photos do the rest of the talking for me, if I could give more then 5 stars I would. The place is expensive as hell but it's worth it to visit a place like this at least once in your life, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I think most of these 5 star reviews were written before they actually went to the restaurant."}
{"text":"A Montreal landmark (or soon to be one) PDC is one of the best comfort food restaurants where I have dined.  We made reservations well in advance of our trip to Montreal but we saw folks who came in with a party of 4 and were seated an hour or so later.  It depends on the day of the week I suppose.   As for the food, it is not for those who shy away from pork.  These guys are big on swine.  During the summers they have great seafood dishes as well (all fresh from the boat) but when you go to a place called the Pigs Feet, what else are you going to try?   Their french fries in duck fat are addictive and the flavors of the tart with cheese, onions and mushrooms still linger on my taste buds."}
{"text":"My actual rating is 4.5.  I don't eat pork with a few natural exceptions such as bacon and proscuitto and I don't eat fois gras, no exceptions, so what the duck am I doing here at this restaurant?    Even though we had reservations at 9:30 pm, we still had a bit of a wait; it was just long enough to build anticipation but not long enough to piss us off.  And when we were seated, they actually very politely APOLOGIZED for keeping us waiting.  Take note, Toronto restaurants!     Despite my reservations about the menu, I quickly settled on a blue cheese, apple, and endive salad to start.  It was delicious.  For my main, I had the bison tartare.  It was served wrapped like two handrolls, nori and all.  It was the very last way I expected my food to look at this quaint Quebecois restaurant, but it was awesome.  I think it's fair to say that everyone at our table was completely impressed with their selections too.    Yes, I think this place IS worth the hype."}
{"text":"After a disappointing experience at the actual restaurant I was quite pleased when the food truck lived up to the hype associated with Martin Picard's food empire.  This particular food truck is split up into two parts, savoury goods and sweet goods. One of the star food items is the famous foie gras poutine.  Prices are in line with the other food trucks in the city.  Braving the crazy line-up at First Fridays I was lucky to get my hands on some of the last foie gras poutine they had.  Ever tasted something that felt so wrong yet so right all at once?  Wrong because it is so heart-attack inducing but right because it is just too delicious to pass up.  That sums up foie gras poutine.  The fries were very thick and crispy and there was just enough gravy so that they didn't get too soggy without sacrificing the taste.   There was also a good amount of cheese curds and the foie gras added a nice touch to the poutine.  The portion was a little small but maybe that's best for my arteries.  The line up was insane too compared to the other food trucks there that night.  My friend and I waited two hours and like I said before we got some of the last foie gras poutine.  Those behind us who had waited the same amount of time weren't going to be so lucky.  It might be best not to visit at First Fridays but the rest of the time when they're out and about."}
{"text":"I went here last night.  It was my first time and I was quite excited having heard so much about it, however it did not live up to the hype.  I started off with the Assiette Cochonailles and then had veal tartar.  All were quite tasty.  I especially liked the maple milkshake for dessert.  However the food as not the problem for me.  What left me so disappointed was the service.  Our reservation was for 7 yet we only got seated at 7:30.  It took forever for the waiter to take our order.  The starters came in a decent amount of time but then there was a significant wait for our main dishes.  When they did finally come they didn't bring the fries that came with my tartar so I had to flag down the waiter to ask for them.  My friend wanted to get her water refilled and had to ask twice before they finally did it.  Since this was my first time I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that maybe it was just a bad night for them."}
{"text":"Martin Picard is well known in Montreal's food scene so naturally his sugar shack is wildly popular and difficult to get into.   Many try to get a reservation here but only few succeed in doing so.  It's not a conventional sugar shack in that you don't eat traditional sugaring off food.  Instead you try restaurant dishes in a sugar shack setting.  Consider this a warning to watch how you eat the day you come here because I promise you that there will be no shortage of food.  The waiters bring tins to take home leftovers before you have even received food because they know that you simply can't finish it all off.  We were served fourteen different dishes and all of them were quite heavy.    On the particular night that I came the menu was Moroccan inspired though we started off the soiree with a foie gras cake.  Yes you heard right, foie gras cake.  It was very decadent.  From there there was what felt like an endless parade of dishes, and we ended up trying fourteen ones.  I was full long before the main courses came but I kept going because most of it was pretty darn delicious.  A few dishes fell flat but the meal as a whole was very enjoyable.  My favourite dish of the night was a beef tagine which had been cooked for 5 hours.  It was incredibly tender.  This epic feast cost about $70 (tax and tip not included) and it did seem like a fair price given the quantity and quality of the food.  Believe me there was lots of food.  Alcohol wasn't included in that and I must admit that drinks were a little over priced.  I ordered a cocktail (whose name I can't remember) and it was a little weak.  I'm happy that I got the chance to finally try the Pied du Cochon sugar shack but I must admit that the whole experience is slightly overrated.  The food was good but it was lacking that extra wow factor that I was expecting given the hype surrounding this place.  Alas, it's one of those experiences that you try once to say you did it."}

It tasted burnt I couldn't finish it, and I appreciate a good cappuccino. This place is excellent (just skip the espresso)."}
{"text":"I think if you order certain things and hit the restaurant on a good night, you can have quite the meal. But frankly, I didn't have that experience. I came as a walk-in and sat at the bar. The place has a raucous, fun vibe, but after a while it's a bit much. Food is maple shack-cuisine gone high-end. Foie gras is everywhere. Entree I was steered to was waaaay over the top -- with foie gras, maple syrup, potatoes, bacon, cheese and probably 12 other ingredients. (Basically, you lost the thread of what they were trying to do). Appetizer was...okay. A fussy terrine of sorts that wedded a pate de foie gras (at least that's what I think it was) with a boudin (black sausage) in a checkerboard pattern -- it looked and tasted alright, but was ridiculously overpriced at about 25 Canadian dollars. Dessert may have been the best thing -- a nice, decadent maple pudding. I saw some dishes coming out of the kitchen that looked better, but I went with what waitress suggested. Oh, and speaking of waitress, she was mostly non-existent -- food took forever to come out and it was hard to flag anyone down (a guy pouring water shrugged at me and said, \"I'm just a water boy.\") Again, that's fine if you're talking a greasy spoon, but it's pretty hard to get out of here for less than 75 Canadian dollars (with drinks) -- I spent over 100. Even more puzzling: Manager saw I was waiting on food and didn't do much to step in... though I think his pour of a free glass of Calvados was an attempt to rectify things a bit. Again, I suspect you can have a great meal here, though I'm still not sure the service will ever be right. No one seemed to be getting there food in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles hit your city? Forget it. PDC is all about Foie Gras and real deal maple syrup and some of the most inventive and creative cooking this side of Joe Beef. I have been blessed to have eaten in some of the finest restaurants on the planet over the years and can hold up my right hand and state while making eye contact, I had one of the top five best dishes ever st PDC. A special for that night of pasta made with pork blood instead of eggs. The rabbi came in and blessed the pig and then leached its essence into the house made pasta. Artisanal cheese topped it and nothing can top it. Wow, it was so perfect, I could have paired down to my after shave and done the dead man's float in a vat of it. Okay...I liked it... alot. The pate was chocked full of foie gras, and chunky piggy parts served with home baked baguette still too hot to touch from the oven. The duck stuffed with, let's say it together, foie gras, and some lovely things from the garden, was not as rich as it sounds as the ktichen deftly creates the unique menu with a balanced hand and perspective. The duck for two was partitioned in the kitchen and rested on a bed of creamed lentils with carrots and onions. I had absolutely no room for the maple pudding with a a bucket of killer vaniller ice cream but I would have eaten the ceramic bowl if they hadn't taken it away. Yeah baby, bring us the room key, we're stayin' here. Oh, and did I forget to mention that the bar cranks out the every best whiskey sours compared to anywhere? Well, they do. The wine list was small but carefully paired to the menu and it would ahve been difficult to make a mistake and if you're not sure? Go ahead, ask. The place has the charm of a Thomas Kinkaid painting and I mean that in a good way. Forget that Thomas Kindkaid made couch art, the cottage in the woods with the warm lights was a great idea, but PDC is a cottage on a small back street and once in the door you are at Grandma's house. The place is simply lovely. No annoying concert volume rock loop to compete with, and when you call the place, a human picks up the phone and talks to you. Take a lesson, A-list America. The staff was causal and relaxed and yet efficient and professonal, until we met Alex, our server. She was a super star. She knew the entire menu from gullet to gizzard and went over the laundry list of specials and described each one from ingredients to cooking method. She was bright and funny and made everyone feel at home in two languages with no effort. As you know sometimes a great server can elevate a meal from good to great as dining out is, or should be, a total experience. Here, Alex was the equal of the menu which resulted in a perfect evening of fabulous food with a great vibe. So, now I have a giant jones on to go back again as soon as possible. PDC should not be missed by rational adults."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dinner!! If you want foie gras, go to Pied au Cochon.   We ordered the foie gras nigiri (sushi).  A well sliced foie gras on top of sushi rice with a taste peanuts butter vinegar matching with sake soya sauce. What a perfect match.   Then we added foie gras burger and pork shoulder ribs.  The ribs are so tasty, with sauce sweet and spicy sauce.   Just by typing my mouth is watering already!!"}
{"text":"Guess I am just not hip enough. This place was loud, chaotic, inattentive and annoying. The duck in a can just came out....odd. I prefer my duck roasted or crispy. This was sort of semi boiled. The pig's foot looked huge but had hardly any edible meat in it. The fois gras poutine was good. Just not an enjoyable meal at $200 for 2 people. Sorry Anthony B!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what else I can possibly add to the 250 other raving reviews.  Au Pied de Cochon is crazy amazing and worth a trip to Montreal just to eat here.   We waited nearly 30 mins for our table (even though we booked in advance) but the hostess explained they do not like to kick customers from their tables and they had people lingering long over coffee. No big deal because they comped us with free appetizers.  The food here is all AMAZING, I'm still having dreams about the giant lambshank I polished off. My friends tried out the steak & frites and a crab pie (daily special). The cod fish fritters and zucchini fritter starters were both delicious too and only $6 per order.  Dinner plus a beer came to only $40 including tax and tip.   Must return to Montreal!"}
{"text":"I called 2 weeks in advance for a reservation, but when we arrived at the restaurant the hostess said my name wasn't there. Then she questioned if I called the wrong restaurant since there is a restaurant in France with the same name? I clearly said no, and showed her my phone record of calling. Then the hostess said \"Sometimes we take reservations and do not write it down\" ????? Not sure how that made any sense to me. Anyways, she then said there are available spots at the bar which was facing the kitchen and can actually see the chefs in action which I don't mind so we sat there. At least we got a spot, or else I would have been pretty pissed since I know this place fills up and you need to make reservations in advance. Regardless, sitting at the bar was an amazing experience seeing all the chefs cook. Reminded me of the movie Burnt.  Asparagus & Morel ($22) Boiled Asparagus, Cooked asparagus and morel (a type of fungus), and topped with a slice of Parmigiano cheese. I still can't describe the flavor of this dish, but it was definitely tasty. I've never had morel before, but it had a really spongey texture - quite interesting.   Foie Gras Poutine ($24) This poutine was hearty, but definitely amazing! Especially if you like foie gras. There were huge chunks of foie gras, and big chunks of cheese. Their cheese is actually made in house (I saw one of the chefs making cheese, although it could be for the Mozzarella dish, although I would assume they would use the same cheese). The fries were crispy and already flavorful on its own! With the foie gras, cheese, gravy, and a few fries all together in one bite - epic moment right there.  Duck in a Can ($44) This was very interesting and creative. Essentially the chefs cook the dish and stuff it into a can. Then, when they serve it, they open the can in front of you and all the deliciousness spills out, served on top of a toasted bread with a layer of squash spread. The squash spread was really good. The duck meat was cooked just right, border line well done. It was delicious, but I do feel the meat could have been slightly more tender - it wasn't as juicy as I'd expect it to be. I really liked the shredded cabbage that was drenched in the sauce, very flavorful.  Maple Syrup Creme Brule ($9) This Creme brule was really good, but SUPER sweet! Slightly too sweet for my liking but it tasted good. Really creamy and you can totally taste the maple syrup.  The service was good, except for our waitress. This was my disappointment. Everyone but our waitress was super friendly and helpful. Out waitress did not check on us during our meal at all, and not to mention she probably missed our dessert. It wasn't until we sat there with nothing for 20 mins, she then came by acting like nothing happened and said \"oh your dessert still didn't come yet?\". Then I saw her keying something in the computer. We waited a total 45 mins for the Creme Brule! Even though at the end the waitress took the item off our bill to apologize for our long wait, that $9 did not justify the 45 min wait.  Not sure if it was just my luck, but I wasn't pleased with the service experience. The food sure was amazing though. Definitely coming back the next time I visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"If you love pork and foie gras, this place is heaven. Recommend getting the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can. We also ordered the onion soup, duck carpaccio and the dumplings.  Onion soup - your standard cheesy onion soup done right. Super tasty.   Foie gras Poutine - must get!! Abundance of extra buttery and fatty foie gras with fries and gravy. This is a heavy dish so great for sharing and having a cold beer.   Duck carpaccio - the presentation of the dish was beautiful. Thinly slice duck with chives, raw mushrooms and a yolk.   Duck in a can - must get as well! The waiter brings over the can and opens it in front of the table. The content of the can contains the small duck, foie gras, cabbage which is all poured over the bread with carrot purÃ©e. The meat was tender and succulent.  The service was very good - our waiter was extremely nice and helpful in making suggestions. There are so many options to choose from so it's great if you come with a big group and share everything!"}
{"text":"Summary: Delicious food but overall experience left something to be desired. When making a reservation ask not to be seated next to the cellar if you get cold easily!  Food tip: PDC's Melting Pot is the best we tried on our table (vs. The fried chicken, oysters and pork chops that other members of our party ordered). The Melting Pot was literally a small pot with a bunch of different porks (pork flank, blood sausage and some others I don't recall) that seemed to be slow cooked and then laid on a bed of the most delicious mashed potatoes ever. This was a seriously good meal. The pork chops were a close second but I with someone on our table had tried the PDC's Cut because I suspect that would have been delicious.  Atmosphere: The interior is very nice despite the single bathroom that means there will be a consistent line of anxious people waiting to use the bathroom if you sit by the cellar in the back and it is busy. The seating up front by the window looked like a nicer place to be in the summer. It was also cold by the cellar because they kept leaving the door open very long when going in there.   Drinks: Lovely as well but not sure how the bartender did not know what either a French 75 or a Moscow Mule were despite having a full bar and no cocktail menu (i.e. you'd expect they know some classic drinks). I ended up having a simple Hendricks tonic with cucumber and it was perfect. I also like that they bring the tonic/soda water in a separate little beaker.  One negative: The declined to give us the wifi password because the owner \"does not like people being on their phones\". Except this was only a problem for tourists because most people were locals and we're using their phones in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Most indulgent meals you'll ever have in your life. You'll leave here kinda hating yourself but it's so worth it!! If I ever came back, I'd def go with a huge party so I can try everything without feeling guilty. Every dish is so rich so you definitely need to share! I'm so glad I got to try this place! It's definitely worth the hype! I'd skip out on the foie gras poutine unless you had a huge group to share because poutine is so rich already, you have foie gras on top of it so it's a bit overload. Tartare temaki is my favorite! It was horse tartare with sushi rice wrapped in seaweed shaped cone. Anyways, if you're in montreal, do yourself a favor and go here!!"}
{"text":"While dining at Au Pied, I asked the waiter if we had enough food. He said we had ordered too much. We hemmed and hawed, and finally decided to cut the zucchini blossoms. Tough decision, but probably necessary.  When the crab salad came out, it had two zucchini blossoms on it.  That's a really classy move. Made me love the place not only for its decadence, but also for great service. I'll tell anybody visiting Montreal to come here."}
{"text":"The first time I made a reservation here, my good friend was coming to Montreal for a visit.  I excitedly described to him how you have to book three weeks in advance, and named a few delicious things from the menu.  A few days later, I remembered that he had recently gone vegan.  Oops.  Last year,  I lived really close by, and we walked in on a Friday night without a reservation.  Somehow, there had just been a cancellation and we were immediately seated.  The food was okay, although it it might have been only okay because we ordered the wrong things."}
{"text":"Crispy PDC salad:  A third dish I suggested to my aunt, this one was not quite as successful as those prior largely due to the \"crispy;\" a gelatinous pork trotter fried to a golden brown and for my tastes a perfect balance to the bitter greens and bright vinaigrette.  Personally not a fan of mustard, particularly the pungent Dijon utilized here, what ended up happening was aunt enjoying the salad along with her soup while I de-Dijoned the crispy trotter and enjoyed it with a few leafs of green.   Plogue Ã  Champlain:  Admittedly possessing a substantial sweet tooth and a fondness for every ingredient present on the plate this composition of a buckwheat pancake topped with bacon, mashed potatoes, foie gras, Ile-aux-Grues cheddar, eggs, and thick maple syrup infused pork stock was #1 on my list of things to try order at APdC and without exaggeration I'll simply say it is one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  A bit breakfast, a bit dessert, and entirely over-the-top savory this is probably the truest representation of what one should expect at Au Pied de Cochon and while I can't say there is anything subtle about this plate it was much like the Monte Cristo in that everything present was noteworthy; an accomplishment that I personally consider validation of Picard's skill of balance in the face of something that could seem sloppy and contrived under other circumstances.  Fried Chicken:  Already realizing we had ordered too much even before our main courses arrived the fact was confirmed when two 18\" platters arrived, the first my mother's daily special of 'whole' fried chicken...and when the team at Au Pied de Cochon says whole they aren't fooling around.  Juicy and plump - apparently brined in a combination of buttermilk, maple syrup, and spices for the better part of the day - what was presented on this plate was a chicken coated head-to-toe  and fried crisp alongside house peppered pickles, maple slaw, and onion rings.  Again favoring gluttony (both in presentation and in flavor) over any semblance of restraint yet keeping an eye on balance what I particularly enjoyed about this dish was surprisingly the sweet versus savory interplay of the slaw and the pickles, both serving to as ample foil to the fried food, refreshing the palate and keeping things interesting with each bite.  Pied de Cochon:  ...and then there was this, APdC's signature dish featuring a whole pig's leg that was partially deboned and filled with foie gras imbued stuffing prior to being breaded and fried.  Individually tagged and plated atop creamy mashed potatoes with a gravy of foie, lard, butter, onions, broccolini, and mushrooms plus a thick slice of seared duck liver on top this was pure debauchery and although it was slow going each bite brought me back for more, a journey that ended when only approximately 25% of the potatoes, a few bones, and a bit of broccolini remained - a feat that led our waitress to fetch Chef Picard who'd apparently suggested there was \"no way were going to eat all that\" when he saw our order and earned me a smiling nod of approval.  The Winter Sundae:  With nearly 200 minutes of digestion while watching the Canadians and Lightning play an entertaining (if not meaningful) game we returned to the same table and the same server for a second round and after joking that I was going to order a second plogue as dessert I instead went with the old adage that there is always room for (maple) ice cream - plus maple cotton candy, maple toffee, house made salty caramel, a brownie, cranberry preserves, maple nougat crumble, and whipped cream.  Creamy and crunchy, sweet and salty, chocolate, maple, and without a doubt \"winter\" - delicious.  Pecan Pie for two and Sugar Pie for two:  At this point hardly paying attention to menu descriptions it didn't seem illogical to order items made \"for two\" and unable to decide between the pecan pie or the sugar pie we opted for both...not realizing that they would arrive with a goblet of ice cream...each.  House made like everything else at APdC and each warm, decadent, and irresistible I could see both the ladies eyes glazing over into food coma status with each progressive bite and despite the late hour an Americano became requisite - free refills on the house as we sat and chatted with the wait staff and a neighboring table while enjoying the flaky pastry and creamy brown sugar custards with the occasional bite of thick vanilla bean ice cream for good measure.  The Verdict:  While I can certainly understand some of the criticisms of both the restaurant and Picard's personal style I could not have been happier with my visit to Au Pied de Cochon - it is comfort food taken to an entirely different level and it was every bit as good as I'd hoped it would be - it was good enough that I went twice in the same night and good enough that my next trip to Quebec will be predicated by a visit to Picard's Cabane au Sucre followed shortly thereafter by another visit to APdC."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place through a friend who had invited me to his birthday dinner at this place.  I hadn't heard too much about it prior to this but when I saw how packed the place was even at 11pm at night, I knew that there had to be something special about this place.     Decor wise, there was nothing particularly fancy: modern rustic - it felt like you wanted to be there to eat-- and eat we did.  Starters:  -the table (of 8) shared an entire foiegras that was pan fried and then doused in some cheese sauce and served with a baguette.  Pretty amazing. - french onion soup Au Pied De Cochon (APDC) style. Hands down the best french onion soup I've ever had.  the reason: BACON/Pork Chunks. - foie gras poutine.  Sounds weird but it works.  For those uneducated in Quebecois cuisine, Poutine is a dish comprised of french fries, cheese curds and gravy.  APDC just added foie gras to the mix and BAM, heaven in your mouth and a punch to your arteries.  Main course: - I got the Duck in a Can which is their take on a Duck confit but of course, with Foie gras (do you see an underlying theme at this restaurant?) which they somehow cook and then stuff it in a can and then open it at your table on top of a dish of celery root puree.    Needless to say i did not make it to dessert but I was feeling more than satisfied with every bit of my meal.  I've been back since and always tend to over eat.  Their Foie Gras stuffed pig's foot is something to try too.   I'd probably share some dishes next time i go but DEfinitely go if you enjoy food.  It is not for the picky eater.  and if you are vegetarian, you shouldn't even be reading this review let alone have clicked on this link for the restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are not afraid of large quantities of heavy, hearty, ultra-rich food, this place is definitely for you.  On our minimoon in Montreal APDC was the first restaurant we specifically wanted to visit (we actually built our visit around this restaurant after watching the Tony Bourdain No Reservations episode...).  My husband and I are used to ordering tasting menus - or at least an appetizer, entrÃ©e and dessert each when we dine - to be able to get as diverse a sampling as possible, of different things on the menu.  This was our approach as we set to tackle the APDC menu for the first time, where one gets spare, one-line titles for the selections and virtually no other description.  However, we were saved from our folly by our kind server, who cautioned us that the dishes were very large, very filling, and we were not likely to make it through a dinner we had orignially contemplated.  He steered us instead towards ordering an appetizer to share, then a couple of \"medium-sized\" dishes:  Venison tartare - delicous, rare, tender, served with a raw egg and a few salad greens which were dressed with nice acid.  Foie Gras poutine - not as tasty as I'd hoped, but the slowly melting Foie on top of the hot poutine did impart an amazing layer of flavourand complexity to the dish.  Boudin and Foie Gras tart - as fantastic and rich as it sounds; it was all we could do to finish every last bit.  Fat liver on fat blood sausage on fattyrich tart pastry. Wonderful!  Absinthe to end -- perfect for cutting through all the richness...  We returned 2 days later and chose to dine at the counter. It was an amazingly warm day, and the large window-doors at the south end of therestaurant were flung wide open to take advantage of the all the spring splendour... we were deeply tempted to switch but decided that we wanted to watch the chef's preparations instead of basking in the light.   Onion soup - made with pork stock, perhaps 3 lbs of gruyere, and gobs of lardons in one very large soup bowl.  Definitely one of the best onion soups I'd ever tasted - complex and rich and oh so filling. I think I took 2 spoonfuls and desisted from eating more for fear of not being able to partake of our other 2 dishes.  Plogue a Champlain: small buckwheat pancake topped with potatoes, cheese, thick-cut chunks of bacon, maple syrup and of course, foie gras. It was the one of my favourite dishes of the trip - the foie perfectly seared and doused with maple syrup -- a wonderful pairing.  Duck in a Can - also very worthwhile for the fanfare with which it is presented.... basically a large and fatty duck magret is placed into a can with a lobe of foie, some buttered cabbage and lardons, a venison broth and balsamic vinegar glaze -- it's cooked and opened and served tableside atop toast and celeriac puree...while rich and tasty, this dish could have used a bit more acid, certainly...  Some things we wish we could have ordered: pied de cochon, the rest of the foie offerings, the offal selections, seafood platter, lobster (served with mashed potatoes and fiddlehead ferns).... we'll have to return for sure."}
{"text":"... back 2 years later and clearly not the same experience...  loud place, with gang of amateur college student waiters being sometimes noisier than clients... smaller portions and only lukewarm when brought to the table...  champlain foie gras reheated and only luke warm = bad... serve it fresh and well done or simply don't offer it...  cote levee de bison is just a joke but was recommended to me by the waiter (this or the pied de cochon, this time? what is the best?). A huge bone but nothing other then chewy fascias and gummy membranes on it (more expensive than the pied de cochon...)! Any bad cook would see that and try to stew and braise this much much longer and more to make it at least chewable, if not edible... sauce was OK because it visually masked the shininess of the piece of gummy \"meat\"... disrespectful!  won't return, won't recommended anymore.... at all...  PS: the bixi station around the corner has disappeared... I would have done the same..."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to experiencing all the hype about this place. We had reservations 3 days in advance and were seated immediately. The waiter took a little while to get to us but overall the service was pretty good. I give the appetizers here a 4.5 stars. The reason for the 2 stars is simply put the duck in a can was disgusting! The meat was tough and over cooke. The flavors in the can were not what I was expecting compared to the appetizers. Lesson learned! Take anything gourmet and shove it in a can you get canned shit! Sorry I just don't get the all the hype about the duck in the can. Everything else was top notch !"}
{"text":"Come here for all things foie gras and that really is end of the story. The restaurant is not fancy by any means, so you can definitely come casually. And don't over order because everything is so rich. For dinner for 2 girls, we shared 2 dishes that was more than enough.  FOIE GRAS POUTINE: Nice and crisp fries, very rich and delicious gravy, big chunks of foie gras. I'm not a huge fan of cheese curds, so we essentially didn't eat that part, but I'm sure it's good as well.   We were literally full on the poutine already...  DUCK IN A CAN: Another must order here. That day's version was cooked with sweet potatoe puree on the bottom. A thick slice of duck breast attached to a large piece of fat, with a very generous hunk of foie gras sandwiched in between. Umami bomb would be an accurate description. The duck was very tender and well rendered. We unfortunately couldn't finish the whole thing, but I made sure to polish off the foie though!  Everything was delicious. Really the only reason I didn't give full 5 stars was because it's a meal that doesn't make you feel good afterwards. We ingested probably 5000 calories. Beside a side salad on the menu, there wasn't anything to balance things out a little."}
{"text":"After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.  Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect.   We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.  With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience."}
{"text":"Another year, another feast at Cabane Ã  sucre du Pied de Cochon.  It's obscene, the portions are way too big, you feel like you won't be able to eat for a whole week when you leave the place, but MAN is it ever good.  The experience is different every year, but it's always super tasty.   The price/quality/portion ratio is simply unbeatable.  I don't have the words to say how much I enjoy my yearly trip to Cabane Ã  sucre pied de cochon.  Just go, it's 100% worth every penny."}
{"text":"My second time to Au Pied de Cochon and by far one  of my favourite restuarants in Montreal.  In fact, it might be one of my favourite restaurants of all time.  You have to make sure you make your reservations early.  I made mine a few months in advance.  In a nutshell there is amazing Fois Gras and amazing Cochon, which is pig by the way.  My partner and I started with the Fois Gras appetizer which was the special.  Essentially it was Fois with cheese, blueberries and Sugar Shack maple syrup.  Probably the best thing I've ever had to eat.  I'll let my pictures do the talking but I highly suggest you make a reservation here."}
{"text":"This place gets packed real quick, definitely get a reservation. I had no idea what to order so I just took recommendations; they were damn good. Sit at the bar if you want dinner with a show. A lot of the food is prepped right there."}
{"text":"similar hipster feel to my beloved Brooklyn Hood,  the food was no joke and the only thing beyond reminiscent to billyburg. The service was exemplary,  well deserving of the 30%tip.  Then there's the actual,  food,  no,  It deserves to be called cuisine.  The wild ... Worth the tracking and trappi g of this rustic yet exquisitely prepared meal. I'll be back for more than one dish next time."}
{"text":"Loud and jolly, Au Pied de Cochon is an excellent place to get your arteries clogged. Don't be surprised to find foie gras as the main highlight on the menu, they don't kid with that. Not for the faint of heart - you've been warned.   Our waiter was extremely helpful and hectic, in a good way. He always had a smile on. He actually forgot a coffee order from our table but made it complimentary.   The duck carpaccio was marvelous. There's something extremely satisfying about breaking the egg yolk and spreading all the yellow yumminess over the raw slices of duck. You're chewing on the delicate duck and then POP, a salty jolt runs through your mouth. The salt crystals were really a nice touch. With an adventurous mindset, I've also had the bison tongue. It's kind of hard not to think that you're actually French kissing a bison. With that aside, the tongue was tender and exceptional.   For my main, I had the famous duck in a can. The blob of food that came out of the can was very good. The gravy where the duck was bathing was rich and flavorful. The duck itself was a bit on the tougher side but it was enjoyable regardless.   Now, I highly recommend getting a reservation. I witnessed a couple beg the manager for a table. They even said that it was their last day in Montreal. Unfortunately they weren't given have the chance to try APdC."}
{"text":"The truck was parked at Place du Canada. I normally do not wait in lines as there are usually other comparable choices available, but I made an exception and it was definitely worth the wait. I ordered the foie gras poutine and the donut. The poutine was succulent and wish I had a bit more but the winner is definitely the donut. My only regret was that I didn't order it with cheese. Definitely worth the price and the line!  My experience at the truck was definitely better then the one at the restaurant, which I had high extremely expectations, which may not have been realistic."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to go there for a long time but you need a three week reservation minimum. I Went there just for the Foie Gras poutine. At first glance it doesn't look like much for 24$ as the portion looks small. However after eating it, I felt stuff to the brim and the food was epic!! Totally worth it. There was a generous amount of foie gras and the quality was exceptional!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said, this restaurant is a tribute to all things that are fat and delicious. We had the Au Pied de Cochon, which we did share on the recommendation of our waitress. We also started out with the Foie Gras Cromquis  and the bison tongue appetizer. Everything was delicious and the service was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"After going to their restaurant in Montreal 2 years ago, I knew I needed to go to their sugar shack. After getting my reservations (note that they are very hard to get and I was on a waitlist and got lucky), I planned my trip here. That's right, I only came to Montreal for this meal. And what a meal! I had read about the portions, but was still surprised at the amount of food. The waitstaff was great, and gave us a ton of take home containers. But the food, OMG the food!!! This theme is Italian based, based on Martin Picard's relationship with Elena Faita, his mentor. It was all amazing! So worth the trip, and reasonable considering the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Whether you're in Lima or Napoli, Southern European and Southern American cities have similarities, they still have bustling produce, fish and meat markets with restaurants that blend in with the chaos. Wooden tables without napkins. Sturdy cutlery. Pots, pans, dishes, and plates in all sorts of shapes and textures, just like the patrons. Layers of seafood on ice along the bar. And of course, the sizzling of onions and shallots (the aromatic of choice for French cuisine) filling the dining room. Patrons gossiping and boasting about their lives, all in all an orgy of noises and smells.  The problem is, we are not in Sao Paolo, but in Montreal, in the bowels of Le Plateau. This is chef Martin Picard's Au Pied de Cochon. The acclaimed Chef attaches his beginnings to Montreal going back to the early 1990's.  The raison d'etre of Au Pied de Cochon is to delight its customers, as much through its exquisite food as through its friendly atmosphere. When it is a question of pure pleasure, one would have a hard time convincing that the feeling of fresh vegetables cracking in your mouth, as good as it may be, is as pleasurable or as intense as a piece of meat, cooked perfectly, especially at the moment it releases its fat and its juices, filling the body with warmth an instantaneous feeling of well being.   One thus goes to Au pied de cochon for the comforting pleasures of a meat-plentiful and generous kitchen, terroire inspired. Martin Picard is a larger-than-life character, for whom eating well means eating a lot, and drinking well means drinking a lot.  Like the changing temperatures of the seasons, the kitchen at Au Pied de Cochon offers a variety of seasonal fare. Without giving up the pillars of the meat repertoire that characterizes the restaurant, Martin Picard's french bistro cuisine includes a large number of fish and seafood dishes. During the winter the menu goes through a dramatic transformation.  Most dishes have only four or five easily identifiable ingredients, in balanced proportions. Chef Martin Picard does get clever with one pervasive product: foie gras. It comes in nearly a dozen combinations, including stuffed into a ham hock, with poutine, and in an interesting creation called \"Duck in a Can\" which does, indeed, come to the table with a can opener. Somehow! this canned duck provided us with succulent meat without any of the chewy fat that is usually expected. After having magret de canards in Montreal in the past, none have come close to satisfying me like this dish.  A heap of mushrooms and onions covered the deep colored duck strips, which were teased to perfection by the chef.   The main courses are for carnivores and pescivores. We were tempted by but did not try any of the large plates of seafood on a bed of crushed ice. The zucchini flowers were delicately fried and sprinkled with fleur de sel, and the calamari was light and citrus filled accompanied by caviar.  When you feel like another bite will send you into a cholesterol-induced coma, maple syrup cake is the only fitting finish.  This is not an establishment for sensitive stomachs and underperforming livers!"}
{"text":"I was worried that this place would be hype only, but was so wrong. We got Duck in a Can, Foie gras poutine and their namesake, Au Pied de Cochon, and each one was excellent. Of course, I didn't anticipate just how large the portions were.  Seriously. They could feed a small country. Or at least,  a party of 5 and not 2.  Such deliciousness!! They were super generous with the fois gras, duck was tender, pork incredibly tender. Had to takeaway most of the Pied de Cochon but even cold.... Was amazeballs!!"}
{"text":"APDC is probably the most iconic restaurant in Montreal. It's a contemporary Quebecois restaurant, not French, but considered Quebecois or French-Canadian. The cuisine is extraordinary rich and heavy, perfect for carnivores, and fit as comfort food during cold weather. I couldn't have dined in at a more appropriate time, a day when it was snowing in Montreal during May.  A long time customer who I sat next to at the bar told me that the menu got condensed over the years. He said that the food is still solid and decadent though.  Sunday is probably the worst day to dine at APDC. It's the end of their week, so many items were sold out. The server named a few special items but was unable to translate it to English so I skipped them. Since the restaurant is known for cooking every single part of a pig, I ordered the \"Happy Pork Chop\". The next item on the menu \"PDC cut\" is basically a double portion for 2 people (over 1 pound of pork). I also ordered the signature cromesquis de foie gras as an appetizer.  The cromesquis was like a pork-based croquette molded into a cube. It looked harmless on the outside, but it's lethal inside. The interior, filled with foie gras in creamy and runny form, explodes once the crust penetrates, so be sure to consume it one bite!  The roasted pork chop was crispy on the outside but slightly on the dry side. The meat was tender and tasted great with the caramelized onion, button mushroom, and sweet bergundy mushroom gravy. The gravy was full bodied and the dish was very filling.  Since I didn't order any large appetizers, I was able to save room for a dessert. I had the pouding chomeur a l'erable, a very classical Quebecois sweet consisting of hot crusty bread pudding drowned with housemade maple syrup. The thick maple syrup was very sweet but served warm and extremely comforting to eat. It was the perfect way to end the meal on a cold night.  Being from California, I honestly don't think I would have a craving for the Quebecois food served at APDC. But since the mood and weather was a perfect fit during my visit, I had a terrific 4-star experience.  A few tips: 1. Make a reservation by email: reservations@restaurantaupieddecochon.ca The restaurant somehow lost my reservation and was about to turn me away, but fortunately I pulled up my reservation confirmed by email and they let me in.  2. Best seat is at the counter, not the bar, they're way different. The most you'll see at the bar is a server cleaning glasses.  3. The restaurant is loud and cozy. 50% local, 50% tourists during my time of visit."}

{"text":"My wife and I visited Montreal in August and wanted to have one really nice dinner while in town. The reviews we read for the restaurant were great so we decided to give it a try. It was one of those few times when our expectations were met and surpassed. We split and appetizer of Foie Gras Poutine - excellent. The gravy was wonderful and the foie gras added a great taste. We then split the Duck in a Can - again excellent. The atmosphere is awesome and the staff was wonderful.  Montreal is not inexpensive and neither is Au Pied de Cochan. If you don't mind paying some bucks, the meal is worth it."}
{"text":"My last visit (back in 2009) was so totally mental it was impossible for me to imagine the PDC Sugar Shack crew having any more tricks up their sleeves, but, lo and behold, version 2011 was bigger and better. Things started with a barrage of killer appetizers (foie gras-laced pea soup, smoked sturgeon with blini-like mini-ployes, PDC maki rolls, green salad with oreilles de crisse, etc.), followed through with three truly impressive mains (a whole smoked pork shoulder with maple syrup glaze, a whole roasted guinea hen with beer-maple gravy, and a baked lobster omelet), and climaxed with a veritable tabletop sugaring-off ceremony (tire d'Ã©rable, a maple glazed tarte tatin, and a chocolate-covered maple-peanut ice cream bombe). This is an 11-course (!) sugar shack experience that's definitely a little more bourgeois than bÃ»cheron, but, man, is it fantastic. Frankly, the only problem is managing to get a reservation.  My advice:  be persistent."}
{"text":"Order anything on the menu, it's all amazing.  Make a reservation a couple weeks ahead of time.  Showing up without one will likely mean you're walking away without eating, unless you show up right as they open."}
{"text":"I tried Pig feet and foie gras poutine with a friend. They are so fatty...but...they are soooooo delicious!!! The foie gras poutine is the best that I have ever tasted in Montreal!! And in the plat with pig feet, there was also mushroom and mush potatoes. The taste was soooo gooood!!!"}
{"text":"Quel plaisir de pouvoir enfin donner un avis sur le restaurant Au Pied de Cochon ! Depuis mon arrivÃ©e Ã  MontrÃ©al voilÃ  plusieurs annÃ©es, j'attendais de pouvoir enfin m'empiffrer comme il se doit dans l'antre du gras. Chose enfin faÃ®te !  Tout d'abord je conseille Ã  tout le monde de jeÃ»ner au moins 12 heures avant ;) C'est une attaque au gras autant qu'une attaque de saveurs, et mon seul regret est que je n'avais plus de place pour le dessert (mon dieu qu'ils avaient l'air bons !)  Le plateau de charcuterie Ã  l'apÃ©ro est dÃ©jÃ  excellent : saucisson au vieux cheddar, ketchup maison aux fruits, jambon braisÃ©... dÃ©licieux ! S'en est suivi la fameuse poutine au foie gras (foie gras poÃªlÃ©, un rÃ©gal) avec ses frites au gras de canard (ouch !) et le boudin maison sur purÃ©e de pomme de terres pour Monsieur. Le tout arrosÃ© d'un dÃ©licieux Chianti rouge et de pain tout chaud, idÃ©al pour saucer et n'en laisser aucune miette !  Il y a beaucoup de choix sur le menu, pour tous les goÃ»ts et les appÃ©tits. Aussi, je reviendrais pour essayer le carpaccio de canard et les desserts !  Un grand Bravo pour cet endroit, mÃ©lange de terroir et de contemporain qui met l'accent sur les saveurs du QuÃ©bec !"}
{"text":"The day of my dinner reservation at APDC was not unlike the day of your first date with the guy you have been crushing on for months: stomach full of butterflies, palms sweaty from anticipation, expectations rampant, near delirium from starving yourself all day...  I arrived fifteen minutes before my reservation and was seated at the bar - the only available seat in the house on a busy weekend night.  It was prime real estate directly across the open kitchen with all its glorious chaos - young, black-clad cooks darting from one end to the other, waving hot pans and plates, yelling orders in French.  It was such a great sight.   And then the food came and it was time to get serious.   First up was a crab and cucumber salad - a special for the day.  The presentation was simple but nice: a bed of shaved cucumber bathed in a creamy dressing (that looked a bit like Hollandaise sauce), topped with a generous layer of crab meat, topped with a green garnish of some sort.  The crunchiness of the cucumbers worked well with the tenderness of the crab meat, and as I bit into the salad, I was surprised to find fresh mint buried between the crab and cucumbers.  Great layers of textures and tastes in this one.    My second dish was the tart with cured foie gras.  This one was interesting.  A tart the size of a personal pizza, topped with a sharp cheese that had been toasted and left to harden a bit.  Beneath the hardened cheese oozed a drizzle of reduced balsamic vinaigrette.  And on top of it all, four slices of foie gras. Biting into the tart, there was the nice crunch from the flaky crust, the sharpness of the cheese, the tanginess of the balsamic vinaigrette, and the sweetness of the foie gras.  Again, a weird blend of flavors but somehow it worked!  This was delicious and really rich.  For my third dish (and this was me absolutely indulging), I went for the homemade boudin. This was actually my favorite: light, fluffy mashed potatoes topped with fat pieces of boudin, garnished with cooked apples and sauteed cabbage and onions.  The boudin melts in your mouth and there's some kind of magic that happens when you add the tender apples and the sweet cabbage and onions.  Amazing.    I would have liked to have gone for dessert, but I literally could not fit another bite of anything in my mouth.  I didn't even finish the boudin (I took it home of course).    This was a one-of-a-kind dining experience and an absolute must-do in Montreal.  The service was also excellent.  So yes, make a reservation and indulge!"}
{"text":"Oh yes, if you have some extra cash and looking for a five star dining experience, you know this is the place to come. You will have to make reservations in advance and apparently Sundays are not as crazy busy as Fridays or Saturdays. Their foie gras is to die for! Literally, I had a foodgasm when I took a bite of this delicious goodness. Next comes the service, just perfect. The restaurant staff are polite, friendly and attentive, when you need to make a hard choice they'll be there to make a suggestion. It was definitely a different kind of dining experience and yes, I will come back again, not just because of foie gras. By the way, if you looking for a place to impress your date, this could be it."}
{"text":"Interesting uses of foie gras. Probably the only place in the world where you can get it on poutine!  I went to this restaurant because it was hyped up by Anthony Bourdain, so my expectations were too high and I was just short of impressed.  The food is extremely rich, that is what they're known for. So, if you are planing on finishing a whole plate, do write off the night!  The wait staff is very professional and friendly. Call and reserve in advance.  If you're against foie gras, this is the last place you want to be."}
{"text":"It's def a place everyone should visit when visiting Canada. All dishes are taken from the most normal typical food from Quebec and it's prepared and presented in a very special way. Every detail on the food is very well thought. Great ambience and i will def go back.  Be ready for a heavy but delicious meal"}
{"text":"Duck, Duck, Duck... in a can! It was absolutely delicious. The foie gras / duck combination was very good. I was a little bit worried I was going to be sick of foie gras after the foie gras poutine (which is also definitely worth trying!), but it was still great. Our waiter was really cool too, he tried so hard to keep us happy, making jokes and making sure we enjoyed everything we ordered. He gave good menu suggestions and when we left he ran out after us to wave goodbye (and it's not like I left a huge tip!)  The family behind us ordered the tuna collar, which was HUGE. If I come again with a group (this time was just me and the girlfriend), I will definitely try it. This is by far my favorite restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"When I mentioned to all the locals that I was going to Au Pied De Cochon they gave me this really jealous look and demanded to know how I scored a reservation...The trick?  Have a friend call 8 weeks in advance.  It's so worth it.  Great food and fun atmosphere!  I went here with 4 friends and we had a feast!  The duck carpaccio really stole the spotlight, so make sure you order it.  The duck in a can is phenomenal, so is the pied de cochon, don't even think about skipping these two stars.   Leave the lamb alone, it's not their specialty.  Here it's all about the pig.  Two rounds of beer, a bottle of wine, 3 appetizers, 5 entrees, and creme brule cost us about 70 bucks each.  Can you get a better deal?"}
{"text":"Oh my God. This restaurant. I. I don't even know why I try to write about it because its my happy place and when I'm sad I want to be there, tasting perfection and floating on a big, soft, foie gras cloud of beauty and love. When I get upset and I'm close to a computer I go on their website and I cruise their menu, reliving my glory days and dreaming about more to come when I figure out when I can visit their Sugar Shack.   ::sigh::  I'll start at the beginning. Bear with me, this is indeed, one of the experiences of my life I will not forget and I won't skimp.   We called ahead to try to make reservations, but it was early, the message in fast French, and ended without options and just a hang-up. We decided to show up at 5 and try our luck.  We showed up too early and walked around the neighborhood. We observed small dive bars off the main boulevard, little parks and benches we smoked \"waiting\" cigarettes on. Bright painted houses and small plants on windowsills - It was your typical quaint Quebecois neighborhood. I loved it.  We walked into the restaurant when it was time: The phone was ringing off the hook, we were the 3rd party there and one party, of course, has a small child who was letting the world know he was very, very unhappy. We got the furthest table from that family, the waitress somehow read our minds.  I sat down and I was looking through the menu and I was so excited. Everything sounds so delicious. How could I choose?   I started off with what was easy. I got the house beer, which was very very light, bright golden ale and went down like water. Things felt better after that.  The bread was hearty, fresh, and very nutty -  a little bit of a sourdough thing going on and I liked it. Was not toasted, but the bread spoke for itself. So did the fresh butter in the tiny mason jar...oh homemade butter I love you so!   We started with the marinated smoked sausages, with pork and foie gras. It was that salty, smoky, meaty, somehow lemony taste that makes you think of good pepperoni without that much heat or oil. It was good, and a good portion of it too.   Next, was the foie gras cromesquis. The waiter had to stop me before I cut into, what looked like, a cubed, fried cheeseball. He said to just put it on my tongue, keep my mouth closed, and let the liquid inside fill your mouth (Hm, where have I heard these instructions before?? Sorry.)  Like a wave of an ocean, the liquid foie gras burst so tiny yet HUGE into my mouth, that gritty cube gave way to a sea of flavors and warm pulsing. It seemed to fill all your senses, you can't hear you were concentrating on the warmth, and your nose smells the cheese it was wrapped in, and the herbs mixed into it, and you were trying to chew and you had the urge to open your mouth to let it all out, its warm and gooey...but its too good to let go. Your reflexes force you swallow you try to control it, the urge to control your gulps and try to savor the moment....and it was gone. I said, \"Wow.\"  This is what food IS. And I'm still only on appetizers.  The boy got the \"duck in a can\" which just serving it to us is a time in itself. A huge can and ceremony of opening is takes to your table. The contents stack marvelously onto your plate in shape of the can, until you demolish it for that perfect bite of lettuce, and perfectly cooked duck. The duck is soft and marinated and cooked to dreamlike consistency. The lettuce is not mushy but not crunchy and the little bit of sweet accents the softness of the duck. Great portions and great flavor.  I got my foie gras hamburger. Mine, this was meant for me. Balanced on a bed of greens and a sweet, thick balsamic vinaigrette was a portion of foie gras and not too much boursin cheese. It is rich but not so much that you get a headache, instead you get that perfect balance of pleasure without the sin of a hangover that is heavy, fatty food...I kid you not that the only place I would ever want to be was right there, at that first bite of magic. To accompany were fries fried in duck fat with truffle sea salt. They were slightly crispy, and delicious.  Dessert tops it all off, and I ordered the chocolate molten cake. It was soft and thick liquid in the middle, a sauce I sucked off the back of my spoon. The perfect end to quite possibly the perfect meal.   I was content, I was satisfied, I ordered another beer and felt like I needed to have a cigarette as I've just had one of the most pleasurable experiences of my life.   The waitress, the entire time, was very attentive, polite, eager to answer our questions, and so gracious when we were leaving. She really helped make it an awesome experience. The prices were slightly high, but definitely not unreasonable for a nice restaurant ($100 or so for everything, not including tip).   This is a place I need to go every time I go to Montreal, even just passing by for an evening. We sent our highest compliments to the chef!!"}
{"text":"So my first review was horrible... I hated the place.   The mistake I made the last time I ate there was trying their popular foie gras dishes. Truth be told: I don't like foie gras! At all! Naturally... That made me dislike every dish I tried. I just find that fatty metal taste unbearable.  So I decided to give this place a second chance.   The waitress suggested pig intestines  and veal testicle as specials of the day. I am sorry but NO! I just can't wrap my head around why anyone would eat that, or beef tongue for that matter.  So I stuck with dishes that appealed to my simple self: cod fritters, lobster sundae and guinea hen. The fritters were good... But the  sundae and the hen were absolutely marvellous and perfect. Un vrai chef d'oeuvre!!  So I changed my mind... This restaurant deserves all the praises it receives as long as you order things that appeal to YOU and not necessarily the popular choices.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went on V-day and the place was packed. The food was fantastic!!! Duck in a can and foie gras (plogue a Champlain) are both unbelievablely amazing dishes.   I know the French have pretty hard baguettes but I think their could have been a tad less tough. Other than that and it being a bit on the pricey end everything was delicious and staff were very friendly/kind.   Tip: make reservations in advance especially for weekends"}
{"text":"Best service. Best quality of food. Worth the price tag for what you are getting. Only bummer is the meat pie we so wanted to try  is $72. Abit too much after we already spent lots. But Definitely coming back the next season."}
{"text":"Just go. The flavors are delicious and the kitchen staff really, really care. You can taste it in everything they make. Just delicious and a treat in every aspect.  Save room for dessert - they do an amazing job!"}
{"text":"The last day of my visit to Montreal, I decided to go out and have a fancy meal, and my first choice was clearly Au pied de cochon.  Unfortunately, I did not have the foresight to get a reservation, so I doubted I would be able to get a spot.  At 7 PM on Saturday, I make it over there, and ask if they have space for one.  They do!  I get to sit at the bar, overlooking the open kitchen.  After looking through the menu, I order the marinated smoked sausage, and the PDC melting pot.  They, the bread, and the atmosphere were amazing.  The space at the bar was a bit cramped, but that's too be expected, and the atmosphere was busy."}
{"text":"Drip Drip Drip  4 star for food and service but -0.5 star for all the water dripping from the vent on top of my head all through my dinner.  Drip Drip Dip   I know it was one of the hottest weekend in Montreal. It was end of July after all and I should be thankful for the nice cool interior of the restaurant with their AC on full blast. But with the water dripping on me the whole time (2 hour) while I was enjoying my dinner was not cool. The staff was all trying their best to stop the dripping from top of the AC vent which ran across the full depth of the restaurant by a squeegee sponge but it was not working....  Drip Drip Drip  Dinner was really good!! Excellent!  We shared   Tarragon Bison Tongue ($8.50) - I just love the Cornichon in that! And now I have a bottle in my fridge at home!  PÃ¢tÃ© de Campagne ($9) - So smooth and rich!  Duck Carpaccio ($14) - Well seasoned, my first time having duck carpaccio  Duck in a Can ($44) - So overhyped! The duck was dry and just not good! Foie Gras was so so. I don't believe I said that but I preferred mine seared...  Braised Pig Feet with Side Pasta ($50) Seasonal - Must Order!! It was so tender and flavoured!! And the pasta which was prepared table side was so good! Perfect al dente and with BACON...   Drip Drip Drip  I would have up my star to a 4 because the food was just amazing and the service was excellent. But the management really need to do something about their cooling system.   I definitely would be back!   PS The reservation system just got so much better as my reservation was confirmed by email and no need to play phone tag again!"}
{"text":"Our last night in Montreal (and our honeymoon in Canada!) I had to make sure ended with a memorable meal, and so I made reservations at Au Pied de Cochon. A Yelp search brought it up as the number one restaurant reviewed in Montreal, and a quick glance at their menu provided enough tantalizing dishes that I didn't question immediately picking up the phone.  We arrived for a slightly early reservation, but the restaurant was completely packed and stayed that way into the evening! We waited just a few minutes for our table, but the hostess was lovely and let me take a peek at the Sugar Shack cookbook while we waited. Our waiter was fantastic, super friendly and informative, and congratulated us when he found out that we had just gotten married. We started with drinks: the Pied de Cochon beer for him (smooth, very drinkable) and I had the Cidre du Minot hard cider (slightly sweet, crisp, delicious). Our foie gras comisques quickly came out from the kitchen (warning, wait a little bit before chowing down), and we each popped one into our mouths and delighted in the creamy, almost liquid, piece of deep fried foie gras. They may seem small, but they're the perfect size.  We then had to wait a little bit for the two entrees we ordered, so we admired the other dishes surrounding us (and wished we could've ordered more food). We shared the Duck in a Can and a special stew gratin they had that evening. I have to say, the presentation skills of the staff are fantastic, and they adeptly uncanned the duck into a lovely presentation that we quickly destroyed as we devoured the succulent and tender duck breast, foie gras, mashed cauliflower, and toasted bread (if there's more there, I don't remember/care). SCRUMPTIOUS. The special stew had housemade pork/veal sausage, cannellini beans, spinach and root veggies, and foie gras of course! It was perfect comfort food, warm and filling.  I had to have dessert, and my husband was willing to indulge me since we wouldn't have another chance to dine there, so we shared the sugar pie for two and the milkshake with PDC maple toffee pieces. The shake came out first, and was delicious vanilla bean ice cream blended with the maple toffee that added a teeny bit of crunch. The sugar pie apparently came with 3-4 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream, which we didn't expect but thoroughly enjoyed. The sugar pie is delicious, similar to having pecan pie without the pecans, with a buttery crust and warm, sweet, custard-y filling.   Our meal was so delicious, I'm coming back here, with or without anyone else because the food is just too good!"}
{"text":"Pissing in the Wind     A friend got a table for the 'apple sessions' at PDC, it was pretty darn awesome.  There are a few things that I disagree with, like the cavatelli dish, and a coupe of other things, here and there but bothering to point them out would really be nit-picking and are, for the most part, a matter of preference.        Suffice to stay that whilst dining here, you will be in the presence of greatness, as Martin Picard seems to roam the grounds and say hi to his guests. It is an experience.     Sure, i think confiting foie gras is retarded, but who cares what I think, it is Martin Picard. The man could drop a deuce, wrap it in tinfoil, bake it for an hour, call it 'terrine de picard' and it would sell like hot cakes.    And by the time you read this there will probably be a new menu anyway...so just go.  Waka Waka"}
{"text":"C'est avec une certaine impatience que je fantasmais sur ce restaurant... un peu trop peut-Ãªtre. Nous avons partagÃ© des \"croquettes\" au foie gras : vraiment rien d'extraordinaire. Ensuite, je me suis laissÃ©e tentÃ©e par la cote de cochon heureux: viande tendre et bien cuite, mais la sauce n'Ã©tait pas assez tasty Ã  mon gout. Mon ami a pris le magret de canard, pour le coup clairement dÃ©cevant. Tarte aux pacanes excellente, mais vient-on ici pour Ã§a?  Vraiment contente d'y Ãªtre allÃ©e, mais plusieurs restaurants dans la meme gamme de prix me rendent bien plus heureuse."}
{"text":"This place is popular. We made a reservation during the week for Saturday and 10:30 is the earliest time. They have indoor and outdoor seating. The service is really good there. Everyone is very friendly. We tried the following dishes. I have to say I've never had so much foie gras in my life.  - Tuna & foie gras: they have tuna special that day as they got fresh tuna in the morning. This one has tuna sashimi, raw egg yolk and foie grad with some sauce. They provided a spoon to eat it so that we can mix anything we want.  - lobster and foie gras Cheong fun: very interesting dish as Cheong fun is a typical dish in Chinese Dim Sum. I like this dish the second.  - foie gras poutine - Pork: I forgot the name but it's one of the special that day. It's pork in mushroom sauce with potatoes and some fresh mushrooms. I have to say this is probably my favorite here. Everything tastes good."}
{"text":"Clap hands for this amazing restaurant! We started with foie gras croquette (3.5 dollars a bite, which is so good. You can feel the melting) Cochonnailles Platter (9.5 bucks including various meat. As a meat lover, I was so happy to welcome a variety of tasty meat ) I can't express how happy I was when I tried the bucket of shrimps(10 bucks which is fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sweet and fresh My favorite here) Oh you can't miss the  PDC Melting pot (20.5 dollars full of meat and buttery mashed potatoes. So good but a little bit heavy for me. The portion is so big) Fries with duck fat is held in a sundae cup. A wonderful meal but don't forget to make a reservation!!!!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try everything on the menu but decided to go with the actual name of the restaurant so we had stuffed pig's foot with ham on top of butter mashed potatoes and sautÃ©ed mushrooms topped with a nice piece of foiegras  Over the top? Yes! Delicious? Oh Yes!  PS. The Bison Tamaki was to die for. Don't order the zucchini blossoms, they were just straight up greasy. I've had better."}
{"text":"Very good high end restaurant. A little pricey, but the foie gras is worth it. If you're looking for foie gras, this is the place. I got the duck in a can. Sounds odd, actually delicious. Make sure you have a reservation. It's a pretty small place and fills up fast."}
{"text":"On connaÃ®t tous la rÃ©putation du chef Martin Picard et sa cuisine excessive et gloutonne.....et bien sa \"Sugar Shack\" perpÃ©tue sa vision culinaire soit...plus, plus et encore plus de calories!!!!  Ma premiÃ¨re visite Ã  la cabane Ã  sucre PDC fut Ã©pique et sans pareil!!!! Oubliez tous vos souvenirs de cabanes traditionnelles.....ici on passe Ã  un autre niveau!!!!  Martin nous a concoctÃ© 10 plats du temps des sucres avec une inspiration marocaine (SURPRISE)!!!!! De saison en saison, le chef propose une bouffe diffÃ©rente en nous expliquant que ses derniÃ¨res creations s'inspirent d'un voyage/recherche au Maghreb...un clash culinaire audacieux!!!! Pour ma part, je revenais justement d'un voyage au Maroc oÃ¹ j'ai pu dÃ©couvrir leur cuisine donc mes attentes venaient de monter d'un cran!!!  Le rÃ©sultat est grandiose!!! Les saveurs de safran, clÃ©mentine, datte, menthe et autres sont mises Ã  l'honneur Ã  travers le foie gras, le porc, le jarret de boeuf, boulettes de saumon et bien sÃ»r notre fameux sirop d'Ã©rable! Que se soit sous forme de tagine, de bouchÃ©es farcies, de cake et autres, le mariage est rÃ©ussi! La cuisine fusion prend tout son sens!!!  Mon coup de coeur fut le jarret de boeuf cuit pendant 45 heures dans un pot de terre cuite en sauce datte/Ã©rable.....Wow....le pain berbÃ¨re qui l'accompagnait Ã©tait parfait pour finir le jus de cuisson!!!! Autres mentions.... la tagine de boulettes au saumon ainsi que la pastilla parmis les nombreux desserts!  Petit manque: Un petit thÃ© Ã  la menthe aurait bien fait descendre tout ce gras et sucre!!!! Aucune option de trou Normand... ce qui est surprenant vu l'ampleur du festin!!!  DiabÃ©tiques, cardiaques....oubliez Ã§a!!!!"}
{"text":"I gave 4 stars because I left this restaurant having had fun, good food and knowing I'll return sometime. The place is full all the time and all the dishes we had were definitely enough for more than 1 person! My only hesitation, but I knew it coming in, is that the food is so rich. There is fois gras on so many dishes and, if not fois gras, then something else equally rich. However, Au Pied de Cochon is a Montreal \"institution\" in a small but really enjoyable space."}
{"text":"Every morsel we tasted seemed just right.  We were only a table of 2 but we went in with an open mind and a goal to try as much as we could.  Having looked over the menu when we made the reservations over a month prior ( definitely need reservations here) we had an idea of what we wanted, but we were not expecting such an array of specials for the night to add to our wish list.  We decided to start off with the foie gras croquettes. Little cubes of sugar cube sized coated bite of foie gras.  The server warms you to eat it in one bite for good reason.  As you break through the coating the unxious liquified foie juice drips on to your tongue and WHAMO, yes you definitely ordered the right thing..  We then had the baccalau fritters which was our least fav thing.  Prob because they had a bit of kick and im not a huge chili fan.  Next we had the perfectly steamed dumplings and octopus which were served in a large Chinese steam basket.  the dumplings were a little clumsy to look at but the flavours were spot on.  The octopus was quite possibly perfection in a dish.  So juicy I actually had to stop and rethink all the times I had ever accepted that octopus has to be chewy, because this dish was perfectly tender and delicious.  We had 2 more dishes, the plague au Champlain which was incredibly decadent and  bit rich  then the mixed pot of pork that included our favourite thing all night, the boudin.  Next time, we would just order the boudin alone it was THAT good  I love that the chef's flavours are rich complex and he respects the simplicity of the ingredients and how they are presented.  Seems very unpretentious, its about the food, not about the perfect table cloths and stuck up servers.  This place is in a great location and has a great vibe.  if you have a chance to enjoy a meal there, just do it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I don't know enough superlatives for this place. You have to be a callous bastard of course because this place is all about foie Gras in every conceivable shape or form. I do feel moderately sorry for the various animals it comes from but a) they are not treated the way the activists would have you believe and b) after one mouthful , you really don't care. I can't begin to describe the whole menu except to say that between the foie gras dishes and the poutine , it was better than sex! Martin Picard is a true genius. A one off in every way plus he's a really nice guy and really knows his wine. If you're ever in Montreal,  DON'T  miss this opportunity for truly great and groundbreaking food. Take a fat wallet with you but it's really worth every penny. Great atmosphere, friendly wait staff, what more could you want. Cholesterol factor is out of sight so don't forget your lipitor. I don't know how I'm going to travel back to Syracuse tomorrow. I can't move my stomach around !!!,"}
{"text":"What can I say... When you're in the mood to treat yourself this is the best of the best. You need to come here hungry and be prepared to not eat for a day after tho ;) if you can try to get reservations to their cabane a sucre!"}
{"text":"You need to understand what you will get going to this restaurant. The atmosphere is equivalent to a typical sugar shack. If you like large quantities of food and are not picky about quality this is the place for you. If you go, go in a large group because everyone else will be. If you are two, sit at the bar. Over all we were expecting more for the price we paid and the hour drive. 0/5 for atmosphere  4/5 service  2/5 for food (we just didn't like the choices, other may disagree)"}
{"text":"A long awaited meal on my recent trip to Montreal. The previous night we had a disappointing meal at Liverpool House so I did not have my hopes very high for this meal. I was very surprised however.  Service was on point and the atmosphere was professional. Restaurant was also MUCH more spacious and more than adequately staffed. Everyone was very friendly and attentive throughout the whole dinner.   We had the foie gras, tartare temaki, and the house pasta. While our dinner tonight was smaller than the previous night, it was much better. The foie gras was served with toasted bread and a maple syrup sauce that was to die for. The tartare temaki was creative and so delicious. The pasta was very rich and filling. I wish I hadn't just had a charcuterie plate before coming here because I had no more room to eat!   All in all I would love to come back here!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and overall experience was pretty good!  So let's start with - for a weekend party - you'll need to make reservations at least a month or two in advance to get a decent hour.  We ended up with a 9:30 reservation which worked out for us pretty well.  We arrived and well the service was a little slow getting our table ready since we did have a reservation but was seated within 20 minutes, so with that said - i was thinking in my head...dinner will be at minimum 2 hours long.  And i started the clock.  We were in the doorway and the waitress was explaining some of the dishes to me as i was asking about the different foie gras dishes they have.  The one that stood out in all of our minds was the Garlic Foie Gras, Foie Gras Poutine and \"Duck in a Can\".    So we sat and chattered away the waiter came by gave us menus and asked if he could be any assistance, but honestly - we didn't have a clue what to order, and he didn't have clue how to direct our menu for the night.  But, he did explain all the specials they had including this amazing looking tuna they had.    We discussed and decided to order the 3 aforementioned Foie Gras dishes and everyone else ordered their own dish, including a Parmesian Risotto, Hot Chicken (which was a snap change in decision when the waiter said it was his favorite), and the Bison Rib.  Sadly they ran out of pork chops and were unable to have those, sooo we ended up not getting those.  The Garlic FG - amazing - they have a dish, with 3 slices of GF on there, some croutons and maybe something else, and this roasted head of garlic.  He picks up the garlic by the long stem, and with a pair of tongs, squeese out the garlic over the FG leaving the juices and the mashed garlic to fall on top of the FG and then he poured a garlic cream sauce over the whole dish.  That was gorgeous and delicious!    The Duck in a Can...everyone talked about it - bread and cheese curds on the plate...the can is opened up table side and poured over the bread and cheese curds and the heat melts the cheese, the juices are soaked up by the bread and the duck meat, gf and everything on that plate was delicious!  Poutine with FG - good...not amazing, but the FG on the dish was delicious!  The Parmesan risotto special had a ton of peas, roasted pork belly, and cream and was cooked perfectly and delicious.  The Hot Chicken - was an amazing mountain of food - seemingly 4 pieces of fried chicken, with bread and peas all covered in a thick buttery and savory gravy that was way too much and very very tasty!  The Bison Rib - was a roasted bison rib with a sweet and slighly spicy bbq rib.  The meat was very very tender and did require a little work to get at, but it was well worth it.  We ordered up Dessert - a decent sized Strawberry Rhubarb pie with ice cream.  The warm pie and ice cream already is a delicious combo.  The sweet and tart pie was perfectly complimented by the cold but soft ice cream.     If i'm going to go back to Montreal - I'd make  reservation to get a better time.  We ended dinner around midnight completely stuffed!  For the 5 of us it was about $60 cnd per person."}
{"text":"Montreal is definitely a foodie town.  Au Pied de Cochon is definitely the epitome of foodie.  As soon as my wife and I decided that we would be going to Montreal for a few days I was immediately on the phone securing a reservation here.  I was very fortunate to score a 7pm reservation for a Sunday night.  First off I want to note that all of our servers were extremely friendly and helpful.  Also, they work their butts off!  Now to the food....  We began with 2 cromesquis foie gras.  A mouthful of warm fried foie gras really set the tone for the entire meal.  At the same time we shared a charcuterie platter that was out of this world fantastic.    Next, I had ordered the tomato tarte (which I had read online about) and my wife ordered a daily special salad.  Unfortunately, she didn't quite hear the explanation of the salad by our French accented waiter.  The Salade Croustillant had some delicious pieces of pig along with a fried delicacy on top that was stuffed with various parts of the pig such as bone marrow.  We quickly did a switch and enjoyed both dishes immensely.  Our last savory courses were the infamous poutine foie gras and the PDC mixed plate which consisted of the best blood sausage that I have ever eaten along with another type of sausage, some pulled pork and a large amount of very buttery mashed potato.  Everything was phenomenal.  We somehow managed to share a slice of lemon meringue pie for dessert.  Despite the richness, and the cost, it is the type of place that I would have gladly returned to during our short visit.  Instead it will be a place to revisit."}
{"text":"Like any other food connoisseurs, I have exceptionally picky taste buds and I look for uniqueness that challenges my perception of how food should be prepared. APDC sets the bar up so high that I could hardly find any restaurants in Chicago that could get even close to it.   APDC is daring and unconventional - just don't expect to find your regular coq au vin or poulet roti grand mere *yawn*. Picard's cuisine is meant to shock. There are plenty of items in the menu that one would never thought of eating. How about some head cheese or bison tongue to start the meal? Entree? Well, duck cooked in a can or some heart-attack-inducing blood sausage and foie gras pie sound absolutely delish!   As gross as it may sound to other people, every single meal at APDC ends with a sense of fulfillment. Not just the appetite but the need for someone to prove me wrong for coming to dine with a preconception of what's gross and what's not. Well, folks, there's no need to worry about the dessert part of the meal. They are not going to sneak some trout into your ice cream like the Iron Chef. But they are to die for! Look no further because they have the best, freshly made, lemon meringue pie on the face of the earth - hands down.  The service is second to none. It feels like a friends/family gathering at APDC. The servers & captains are extremely disciplined and super hot. We ordered with the captain but the servers knew exactly what our orders were. The cutlery were perfectly set and the food arrived exactly where they were supposed to be. No questions asked. I dropped my fork and I got another one literally, in five seconds. The restaurant was packed and they were super busy. Yet, they care about details like these. Now, that's excellent service!  I have never been disappointed with APDC and I have got to say that this is the best restaurant I've ever been in my life. I don't give a lot of 5 stars but if I could give it a 10, I would. The only regret was I never got a chance to try their pot au feu because I always got the 10pm reservation and they have sold out by then. Well, this won't be my last visit, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"If you love the subtle, fatty taste of foie gras, you'll love this place. We took advantage of their seafood season and ordered their PDC seafood platter replacing our previous choice for an appetizer, and added on the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can.   The PDC seafood platter was impressive. There were around 25 pieces, and they weren't just shucked oysters and clams, razor clams and snails on ice. They were treated in their own unique way. We had chopped clams with a beautiful apple, walnut, oil mixture. We had the most tender snail meat ever. We had maybe 6 pieces of shucked seafood, but they were treated with jelly or had a vinaigrette for us to enjoy with them. It was worth every penny and was deeeeelicious. It was a bit rich though to start the meal.  The foie gras poutine was probably the most \"disappointing\" of the three dishes if you could even call it that. The gravy was delicious but it overpowered the foie gras unless you really tried to identify the taste of the fatty liver. It would have been just as delicious had we just ordered the regular poutine or tried all the other famous places for poutine in Montreal.  The duck in a can was DIVINE. Beware though, only order this if you're ready for a very fatty dish. The duck wasn't melt in your mouth but the texture was done in that way to pair well with everything else in the can (foie gras and cabbage) that was cooked to a melting texture and taste. It was so rich and so fatty and yet I couldn't stop eating it. The foie gras was succulent, soft, and paired incredibly well with the hearty duck. The cabbage was clearly greasy but it carried the flavor so well that you could very well overlook the richness of it and think it might be a healthy addition to the can's contents. Btw the cabbage seems to also have been previously sauteed or braised with big chunks of bacon. I would definitely order this dish again and come back to try all the other dishes too.  The service here is impeccable. Everyone is friendly, informative, and quick. If your waters are even 1/3 of the way down, they'll refill it. If you have dishes that are finished, they'll take them away within a few minutes if you look like you're ready to have them do so. You are seated reservations on the dot, rather than having to wait an additional 15 minutes after arrival. Everything here is a well-oiled machine.  Our only surprise is that our waitress told us that most shirts (I know, we're such tourists) were out of stock in Mediums, but the hostess nicely informed us that they had stock of everything. Might be a subtle way to let us know people wanted our seats? Or could have just been a mistake, doesn't matter, we loved the food so much I didn't dock the ratings for it.  Let's also say that for this quality and amount of food the prices are very reasonable. If you were put PDC in NY, these dishes would cost double, which makes me an even bigger lover of this restaurant! For special occasions, this place is a must. It's not the most romantic of places, since everything is bustling, it's somewhat noisy, so on. But it sure is a hell of a place to dine and watch them prepare foods if you're sitting at or alongside the bar. Luckily we were sitting next to the fire oven and the seafood station so we enjoyed watching all three of the chefs busily preparing their dishes all night! I could have sat there for hours on end without having eaten it was that interesting.  We went in knowing that this was a famous restaurant but not expecting that this was the best in the world. With those levels of expectations what restaurant will ever pull it off? But if you go in there thinking that the food is supposed to be really good you'll love it."}
{"text":"I'll let you in on a secret: I've been a fan of pork (most notably, its smoked offspring, bacon) long before \"bacon in everything!\" became a popular rallying cry.  Illustrative example: a lunchtime treat in middle school was a peanut butter and bacon sandwich.  No foolin'.  So, when I moved to Montreal and heard of a restaurant named in honour of the pig...I was in.  Even before I read all of the glowing reviews, heard buzz for its owner Martin Picard, and tasted the amazing food for myself.  And...amazing it is.  Au Pied de Cochon became my standard choice for \"parents in town\" dinners.  I've eaten my way through the menu from delicate fried zucchini blossoms to heavy foie gras-topped poutine (the restaurant not-so-subtly enforces a go big or go home approach).    For all of the heaviness (long braises, dark sauces, rich meats), however, Au Pied de Cochon is able to be delicate with its flavours and textures, too.  Perfectly fried ittle cubes (cromesquis) explode in your mouth, taste buds fist pumping with excitement.  Summertime brings the option of a seafood tower to the menu, with locally sourced options plated in an amazing vertical display.  Lemon, berries, fresh herbs and local vegetables: this restaurant's focus is not just a tribute to the pig, but to the bounty of Quebec.    The space is beautiful, the staff is amazing, the vibe is happy and bubbly and celebratory (as it should be: I challenge you to leave this place with anything but a smile on your face).  Two quick anecdotes:  Un: once, I stayed until after close, finishing some drinks.  At end of service I saw the staff congregate by the bar to take final \"we did it, gang!\" shots.  That comraderie was not only special to witness, but is truly evident in how the staff runs service.  It's not a formal vibe, but the front and the back of the house runs like a well-oiled machine.  Deux: a friend was having an engagement dinner at Au Pied de Cochon.  I was unfortunately unable to make it, so I called in advance to ask if they could do something special for the table in my absence.  Not only were they happy to get in on the surprise, but they presented all those arriving with champagne, charging me very fairly (and, by Toronto standards, far less than market price).    Yelp note: Go.  Here.  Hungry."}
{"text":"I know this restaurant does not need any further help from me but I have to show some love.  Not to sound snobbish, but I am definitely a foodie and have been to a lot of restaurants all over the world and if I had to pick one place for my final meal, this place would have to be it, even though I've only been able to eat here twice on my way to Tremblant.  My dream is to show up at the bar here and order the \"Bourdain Course.\"  This restaurant gets me.  Ever wonder why they don't make Poutines more fattening, in addition to the french fries, cheese and gravy.  Add some Foie Gras, that's the ticket.  Some other chefs would try to make poutines more healthy.  This place realized that what poutines was really missing was some extra-high cholesterol organ meat.  Pig's head anybody?  Steak tartare?  Check.  I have to believe if this chef wanted to open a location in Manhattan, it would be the hardest reservation in town.  Just to keep it real and so you know I am objective, I will have to say the Duck-in-a-Can was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"On our trip to Montreal, my boyfriend and I gave ourselves the pleasure of one nice fancyish night out, and this was our go to from all the amazing write ups we've read. We were not disappointed!  We made the reservation a week before, and the only times they had were either 5:30 or 10:30, we opted for the late night meal instead of the early bird special. This was a much better choice! The place was buzzing with happy customers and a delightful staff.   The food, alright, I can't even talk about it still because I can't find anything like this in New York yet that isn't unreasonably expensive and too uppity for my taste. But I will give it a go. The pickled beef tongue is still my favorite dish I've had in a really long time. I tried beef tongue for the first time a few weeks ago and now I'm hooked. It was so moist and the bread was the perfect crunch to the tenderness. We also had the beef tartare, whose presentation in itself was beautiful, and the zucchini flowers. Now the main course, we obviously had to try the Duck in a Can, and I was not mad about that. It was moist and delicious and I love a good presentation of food.  If I'm ever back in Montreal, which I hope to be, I will be back and I will eat all of your duck in a can and more."}
{"text":"Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.  Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.  Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.  The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.  We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?  There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.  We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.  We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.  Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.  Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore."}
{"text":"I haven't ever had such a soul warming meal than the one I had here. I can't believe it's taken me this long to review it - I kinda just assumed it'd be one of the first restaurants I reviewed on yelp. Anywhoo, Martin Picard knows how to stuff you with rich food. Duck, maple syrup, foie, pork, etc - it's all here, and it's all good.  The house beer is pretty good, and the open kitchen lends a pretty casual ambience to a casual eatery. Nothing casual about the food though - this is all top notch cooking. I've tried the foie poutine and really it's great, mostly for the foie - the fries and gravy are good too but the livery sweet foie takes the spotlight. The duck dishes are really amazing too. I remember the PCD melting pot including pork, two sausages, and an unnecessarily fluffy bed of wonderful mashed potatoes underneath. All covered with the rich jus from the meats, of course. The portions are not for the shy - thankfully too, because it's just all so delicious. The pied de cochon with foie most definitely can be split between at least 2, probably 3 people - but it's damn tasty.   You kind of want to roll over in your seat when you're done eating because it's just all so self-indulgent. But when you step out into the frigid Montreal snow, you really begin to appreciate it all and feel super happy and fuzzy from having a warm, filled stomach."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  This was definitely the best meal we had for the Montreal/Quebec trip.  We shared Tartare Temaki, PDC's Melting Pot, Clams with dry sausage and Fries in duck fat.  The veal tartare was amazing even I'm normally not a fan of raw meat (sashimi is a different story).  The texture was a bit crunchy and the veal melted in your mouth.  The melting pot was a mixture of 4 pig parts.  Great flavor though I wasn't keen on the pig blood sausage.  Clams with sausage was an interesting concept, but I personally prefer the mussels with bacon version (maybe because the bacon bites are a lot smaller yet still add flavor to the mussels instead of just having 2 ingredients cooking together..?)   The one downside was all the dishes except the tartare were too salty for our tasty hence 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Omg!! Where do I start? First, i was so happy I finally made it to au pied de cochon. I've been wanting to try this restaurant since I saw it on No Reservations. Second, it did not disappoint. The food was insane. We wanted to try everything but we only had enough room for the stuffed pig and even that was too much for us. It was the richest, most indulgent and tasty little pig foot I've ever tasted. The service was excellent and the atmosphere of the restaurant made the experience that much better. I'll be going back the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great upscale presentations of local comfort foods. Large portions and very friendly service. Sat at the \"bar\" overlooking the kitchen and watched a very well oiled cooking machine work wonders. Dont eat lunch if you are going for dinner. Make reservations well in adance. Its worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, Memorial Days 2012 and 2013, and it's definitely a place you don't need to go to more than once a year. They don't do balance here - just about everything on the menu is a celebration of richness, fat and decadence, so the key is to order strategically so you don't get overwhelmed.  Though you're probably going here for pork/duck/foie, I highly recommend the PDC raw bar platter, a fantastic spread of fresh oysters, clams, escargot, crab salad, etc, etc. This massive platter (the smallest of several offered!) could easily serve as appetizer for a table of 6-8 and is a relative bargain at $60. (I had it with a party of two others and was stuffed by the time the entrees came!) What's particularly great about it is the brininess of the seafood that serves to complement all the goose and pig fat you'll be eating later. For that reason, the endive salad is also a fine choice.  The namesake pied de cochon is a huge, delicious trotter smothered in a sauce flavored with mustard and vegetables. The meat itself is blanketed by a thick layer of skin and fat, which you can nibble on sparingly while going for the falling-apart flesh underneath.  Foie gras poutine smothered in the richest gravy and a generous number of lobes is delicious for two or three bites until it begins to overwhelm. Get one for the table, or make someone else order this and eat off their plate.  Also order the side of vegetable. On the night we came it was a delicious serving of spring asparagus and fiddleheads, simply prepared, that was instrumental in combating overrichness.  I was a tiny bit underwhelmed by both duck in a can and duck magret with mushroom sauce. Would probably stick to pig in future trips.  The decor is classic French bistro with subway tile, dark woods and a sizeable bar and impressive glass wine room you can admire from the dining room. No wines by the glass, so it's bottles or beers. Make reservations well in advance."}
{"text":"I was intrigued when I heard that Au Pied de Cochon was one of Anthony Bourdain's favorite restaurants. Given that the restaurant's name means \"At the Pig's Foot\", I'm not surprised as Mr. Bourdain is known for his infatuation of all things pork. However, the restaurant is about more than pork; it's about indulging in all things rich and comforting. The main menu is filled with a meaty assortment of pork, beef, and duck dishes (vegetarians need not enter). Foie gras even has its own section as a \"meat\" with over 10 menu items...a foie gras lover's dream!   The restaurant has a lively yet laid-back feel. It is non-descript (no sign outside) but full of warmth as sunlight from the large windows and skylights cast a glow on the honey-colored wood throughout the dining room. The staff also provided excellent service in an easygoing manner. It was good to be in such a comfortable environment as I let go and ate myself senseless...  Foie Gras Poutine - poutine is to Canada as what chili-cheese fries are to the South. Up here, the Canadians top french fries with gravy and cheese curds...and Chef Picard then takes it one step further by adding a velvety slab of foie gras on top of it all. The gravy on this poutine was ABSOLUTELY MINDBLOWING! I don't know if I can adequately describe it...imagine a gravy that's thick, buttery, warm, creamy, and oh-so-savory, then multiply that goodness by 1,000. I cant' get over how good it was! Needless to say, I did not leave a single drop of gravy on the plate.   Plogue Ã  Champlain - deliciously addictive! This dish consisted of a buckwheat pancake topped with cheese, potatoes, thick-cut bacon, and foie gras. And on top of that was Quebec maple syrup, chopped apples, and parsley. The contrasting sweet and savory flavors were in perfect harmony. It was like having dinner and dessert wrapped up in an exceptionally decadent bite! [I'm literally salivating as I write about this!]   Seafood Platter - the restaurant had a huge display of fresh/live seafood, so I thought it'd be a good idea to \"balance\" our heavy courses with a seafood platter...little did I know it'd be a gigantic mound of seafood! It was a heaping assortment of stuffed mussels, conch, razor clams, calamari, cherrystone clams, oysters, and even bowl of periwinkles sauteed in black bean sauce. Prepared with a number of different sauces and marinades, this was much more elaborate than the typical raw seafood platter. It's now clear why this dish wasn't served first. I did find all this seafood to be overwhelming though, and would have rather had the option to choose a few seafood items from the menu instead.   Dark Chocolate Pot de CrÃ¨me - Luckily, I always have an extra stomach for dessert so I didn't miss out on this luscious chocolatey goodness. It was so scrumptious with the graham cracker crumbles  The restaurant also served this terrific spearmint green tea by Kusmi. I liked it so much that I found it online and ordered some afterwards. Too bad I can't have that orgasmic poutine and plogue shipped to me as well. For now, I guess I'll have to longingly count the days until my next visit to Au Pied de Cochon.  **For pics of each course, go to my blog linked under my profile. Enjoy!**"}
{"text":"Delicious, fun and wonderful service. We had Duck in a Can and the Foie Gras Poutine, which were both delicious but probably too rich on their own to have together. Our fault for ordering too enthusiastically. The location is romantic and the ambiance of the restaurant was vibrant and inviting!"}
{"text":"I've been recommending this place even before I ate there myself. It's reputation precedes it for good reason. I finally was able to enjoy the food here in a weekend trip with my close friends. Highly recommend to make reservations beforehand. The place is always full.   Foie gras sashimi - I would drive ask the way back to Montreal for this single item on the menu  Duck in a can - this is what they're known for, you can't eat here without ordering this. How they cook their duck to perfection in that can is just wizardry in my eyes. This also takes FOREVER to make, so make sure you order other stuff too to hold you over.  Every single dish we ordered was fantastic. Our waiter was very patient with us because some of they had run out of some of the dishes we wanted. He suggested we share some items, but I was craving a burger (how do you share that?), so I got what I wanted and everyone share split pasta, meat loaf, lamb.   Our duck in a can took nearly an hour to come out, and our waiter appeased us by giving us shots on the house. Don't mind the wait after that!"}
{"text":"First time in 3 years since I moved away from the region. We ordered the daily special , roasted pig leg and a  cheese pasta as a side. The pig was right on, but the server forgot to pass us the sauce/ au juice not until midway through our meal. The pasta dish was real good. Overall it was a good meal. Good food, good company, the staffs were great. But I will stick with my normal dishes when I go back again."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I also found out about this place through Anthony Bourdain's book and travel show (see link below), then reading up about it on eGullet, finally went a few years ago and have been back many times since.  The sugar shack decor is a bit odd at first if you're expecting your typical fine dining restaurant, but with the food (and portions) they serve, it makes sense and really works - not just a gimmick.  The chef, Martin Picard - who with his various new enterprises, TV show, etc. doesn't work the line as much as he used to, focuses on two things on the menu - pork and foie gras - there's a lot of pork and a lot of foie gras.  This is not vegan country.  All the foie gras dishes work, if you plan on only going once, go for their now oft copied dish, foie gras poutine - a high end take on a traditional  quebecois (junk food) dish.  Pass on the foie gras burger.  Be warned, as you'll see in the video, the portions are huge.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD2HxJoCD54"}
{"text":"Visits: 1st Rating: 4* Service: excellent & informative Dishes: Stuffed Pied de Cochon; Fois Gras Cromesquis; Bison Tongue; Poutine Temaki; Sugar Pie  First off, make sure you come here with an appetite. The portions are a good size. The food is amazing. Flavor after flavor bomb. Good surprise taste after the next.  -Stuffed Pied de Cochon (5*), stuffed pigs feet. Basically they take the lower part of the pigs leg, cut a flap in it, remove the bone shank, stuff it with pork meat, close the skin flap back & then roast the leg. Amazing flavor bomb. Huge portion so if you're going to get this, maybe not order anything else unless you're feeling very hungry. The pork comes out like braised meat would, tender & flavorful. So good. -Fois Gras Cromesquis (4*), fois croquettes. Pretty good. If you love fois then you'll love this more than I did. It's crispy outside but very creamy & liquidity, flavorful inside. Be careful because if you bite in too soon (like right when they bring the dish out) the liquid will burn you. Good dish. -Bison Tongue (4.5*). If they didn't tell me it was tongue I wouldn't have known. It came out so tender, like braised beef. And the flavor was very similar to braised beef. Very good dish. -Poutine Tamaki (3.5*). Poutine is big in Canada & it's served differently in pretty much every restaurant. And wifey is a big poutine fan. So we always order it to try the different kinds. The basis is the same, fries or potatoes with gravy sauce & cheese curds. This one is good but we have had better. Maybe their sauce was a little too heavy, but then again this place isn't for light weights. -Sugar Pie (3*). Not sure what goes into making this. But it's good. A little on the sweet side but I'm sure there will be some that like it that way. For me, it's different. Hard to describe the flavors though & wished it was a little less sweet but it's still good."}
{"text":"A fun place to fatten yourself in a meal full of foie gras! There's a whole section in the menu dedicated to just foie gras dishes! Do try the foie gras poutine as a starter to share for $23 or better yet, get the \"foie gras duo\" for $51 which is a bison burger and foie gras and balsamic reduction and a half order of the foie gras poutine. Extremely decadent duo but great if you want some burger and fries and a whole lot of foie gras!  The duck in a can $43 is another must and yes, the dish comes out of a can that is opened in front of you. It comes with a duck breast with 100 grams foie gras, balsamic reduction, buttered cabbage, roasted garlic and thyme. Extremely rich but worth trying. The duck was extremely tender. The whole dish is very brown with more brown so it's hard to see what you're eating.   Service is extremely prompt and friendly with lots of knowledge on the food and wine.   Bathroom is located at the back and one behind the bar counter (weird spot). Not a fan of the soap they use....hate actual bar soap in public places as it feels pretty nasty especially this bar of soap as it was one of those natural soaps with lots of tree branches and such embedded in it. ew.   Nonetheless, fantastic over the top foie gras eatery that's a must try if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food, amazing experience. So decadent. We had beef marrow to start and beef tongue. I had the canard in a can which is the funkiest presentation I have ever had at a restaurant. They literally open a can and dump out a fully cooked to perfection meal on your plate. So soooooo good."}
{"text":"Counting both times I have been to this city, this was by far the most shocking disappointment in Montreal. The number of glowing reviews and the articles in trusted magazines should have lead to a positive and memorable experience at this restaurant. What happened was a disaster on a lot of levels.  What I can safely start off by saying is that this restaurant has, by far, the worst hostess of all time. I introduced myself and noted my reservation in French... then, in English because she gave me a blank, yet critical expression. Speaking English didn't help matters much. She looked down and then answered the phone. Now, there was no one behind us and no one walked in while she was on the phone, so we waited. And waited. And waited. Then, we waited some more after she (very rudely) told us that we would need to wait longer for our table. We went outside and then came back in, only to be dismissed again. Thirty-four minutes after our reservation started, we were seated.  We had a wobbly table that was immediately fixed by our the nearest food runner. Our table was next to the bright bar that overlooks the kitchen. It felt good-busy, not uncomfortable-busy.  After we ordered drinks, we got a deconstructed makers mark and coke (they had a lot of American liquids), which allows you to make your own consistency. Clever.  During this time of ordering and drinking, the water boy was the nicest person we interacted with. The hostess, our server, other people's servers seemed to be grumpy. I don't know if they just got yelled at or all had a collective agreement to be terrible, but the only thing that was clear was that they were terrible.   We ordered the codfish fritter, beet and goat cheese salad and duck in a can. Nothing stood out as being amazing.  It was fine is the nicest thing I can say about it and I am known to positively exaggerate about everything.   The thing about all of this is that it took fifty-three minutes to get our dinner, after our appetizer. The temperature in the restaurant increased dramatically as we waited. Just so, so hot. Sweating grossness. Ugh.  The maple ice cream was perfectly timed, but not for good reasons.   By the end, the servers were actively drinking and flirting, really not giving any attention to their tables. Our server was leaning into our table while we signed the bill. Just a disaster. I sincerely wish this went better. Les 400 Coups was approximately a million, billion times better than this dinner. I would never recommend that anyone come here for dinner."}
{"text":"top 5 meals of my life.  we got the duck in a can, stuffed pork shank, fish baked in a crust, maple pudding, and homemade ice cream. everything was immaculate."}
{"text":"Yeah, this is an experience in food, one you shouldn't pass up unless you're a vegetarian, can't eat pork or duck, or simply not into foie gras. This place though, has so many creative takes on good high end foie gras that results into one thing, good. Plain and simple. I like poutines, they're alright. But I thought I'd enjoy them best when I'm plastered at 3 in the morning. This place though, thank you so much Martin, took it to a different level, Foie Gras Poutine. Travesty? Nope, it was the best dish among the Beef Tartare, Duck in a Can, and Duck Magret in Mushroom Sauce we ordered. Not to say the other dishes weren't good. They were superb. But the flavors in the poutines went so well together I thought it was the best. Weird eh? Go try it out for yourself.  I'll definitely be back to try out the other dishes. One of my saving highlights in visiting Montreal in winter."}
{"text":"With the caveat that I will not order what I ordered again!(Huge caveat!) This place does it right, though. It is just the cuisine style that I was not up to.  Place is very cute, located on the petite rue Duluth, which is a nice little side street, with cobblestones, and trees. Today was sunny, and the front was open to the sidewalk, so it was quite lovely. As were the adorable waiter, did not mind them at all. The service was great, when I got in right before 6pm (my reservation was at 6, but the seated me a good 15 minutes early!) The service DID slow down, though, around 6:30 as the place filled up. But there were still plenty of servers to take care of everyone. The food was exceptional. I had a green salad, Au Pied's house beer, and the Foi Gras Poutine. Now, the Poutine, I will admit, was too much for me. Having never had foi gras, or poutine, it was a challenge that really took it out of me. That being said, the foi gras had a good crisp outer layer, the cheese curds were very large, the gravy well flavoured, and the fries were extremely good. I think these may be the best fries I have had. I would go back just for them, they have an excellent flavour, crisp texture, and a deep brown colour.  Even the green salad was good. The vinaigrette was very peppery, and had a good over all balance. The greens were varied, and included lots of yummy chutes, and stems as well as leaves. The bread was excellent, goo soft center and hard crust. I was impressed through and through. If you are not afraid to try honest Quebecois food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Wow this place was spectacular. The gf had the most incredibly moist and delicious muscles I've ever had the pleasure of inhaling. The foie poutine was just divine - I've never enjoyed chips and gravy so much in my life."}
{"text":"I can't really describe the experience adequitly. It was so much more (and better) than I expected. Get the foie poutine and split the pigs head for two.  And sit in Gregoires (sp?) section.  Dude is ill.  Go prepared to spend some money.  It. Is. Worth. Every. Penny."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot after hearing so much about this place, but it did not quite deliver. We had to wait even though we had a reservation, which was a bit annoying. But they gave us croquettes to make up for it. Everything was fatty and good, but nothing outstanding.  Note: There was one busser who had rashes and scabs all over her arms, that was disgusting and probably not safe for her to be around food!!!"}
{"text":"We had another wonderful experience at APDC! The service was excellent as usual. we ordered the pizza charcuterie and foie gras which for me was a highlight! We ordered all the specials for that evening, a girot de porc, Vietnamese style veal, tuna tartar, pÃ¢tÃ© de campagne. Fantastic meal as usual!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time at the cabane and it was my favourite menu yet! Attached are photos of the Harvest season menu 2016 for anyone that's curious! It's an awesome experience and you leave with leftovers for a week!"}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon did not disappointment I had made my reservations for myself and 3 friends about 2 weeks out for 10pm. It was our big stop for our large road trip. The emails and telephone calls, the staff were very professional and courteous.   When we arrived, it started to rain, so they had to move some tables inside, and we ended up sitting at the bar, which was no problem.   The food was incredible, even when it was super hyped up to me beforehand. Usually being hyped up about something ruins an experience, but not here.   We had the duck in the can, smoked meat, poutine, vegetable, carpaccio special, and one other dish that involved smoke ham and a sweet pastry. I wish we had ordered a bit less so that we would've had enough room for dessert!  Our server at the bar was also great and friendly, and very helpful and attentive. She was pretty excellent.   I feel bad because I had miscalculated the tip in my head, and gave a poor tip, this had only occurred to me much after we had left. Next time, I will make up for it."}
{"text":"You either love it or hate it :)  We love it...  If you're looking for fantastic French decadence in food, you've come to right place.   The Look and The Feel   Don't expect a quiet, subdued fine-dining experience. The ambiance is lively and jovial, especially on Saturday nights. Even though this restaurant is surprisingly small, it maintains its appeal by providing customers a warm cozy feel. The decor is mostly wooden with touches of an old cellar charm with wine bottles and recipe books lined up. On warm nights, like many restaurants in Montreal, the glass front door is stays open allowing customers a completely unobstructed view of the charming Avenue Deluth Est.   The Menu   The menu filled is filled with duck, pork, fois gras, duck, pork, and more fois gras :) But don't let the omnipresence of meat fool you. Yes, it is a carnivorous dream to be dining here, but they also offer a great selection of fresh Nova Scotia seafood. For those customers who are on a diet or complain of food being too rich tasting---stop reading now.....   Our Order  App: Foie Gras Cromesquis---It comes in two small balls filled with Bordeaux wine and fois gras, slightly fried and made to perfection. You just pop them in your mouth and they melt away leaving your tongue dancing for more.   App: Duck carppacio--who knew raw duck with some spices and chives would taste so delicious.  This dish is served with a raw egg yolk which adds a creamy richness flavors. The french bread went perfect with this.  App: Blue Cheese, Apple & Endive Salad- I told you this place is not just for carnivores. The salad was crisp, fresh, and truly memorable.   Main: We ordered the signature dish--Pig's feet--and the lobster. Both were cooked to perfection and simply delicious.  I personally recommend the lobster  not the signature dish and I'll tell you why later. The lobster was succulent and cooked to perfection. I loved the fact that there was huge pieces of lobster, no shells all meat!  The pork was simply good, nothing to write home about. From start to finish, my husband and I felt guilty eating food that was so tasty.   The Service  Service was friendly. The greeter was super friendly. Our waiter, on the other hand,  was mediocre. He explained to us that he used to be a master chef and seemed a little bitter to be a waiter, but overall he tried his best to be pleasant and he did a descent job at following up with us for drinks and to check on how the meal was going.   Lost a Point  So here's where Au Pied de Couchon loses points for me....The waiter recommended numerous dishes but did not mention the signature dish, so we asked if the signature dish is popular. He said yes, oh yes, it's popular. What he failed to mention to us is that the signature dish is big enough to feed at least four people. We were really disappointed that this ex-master chef/server did not mention the size of the dish. I wish he would have said something along the lines of \"Yes, this is our signature dish and it is very famous, but it's not very popular due to its size. There are other dishes on the menu I'm sure you would enjoy such as....\" I also wished that he mentioned that the flavours are not really unique. Although the meat was tender, to me it was just a great roasted diner, no unusual flavors or presentation. It was literally a log of meat on a bed of mash potatoes with gravy--  Overall Experience  Overall we were happy with the food and dining experience. The location was great. The ambiance was cozy. The food was unique and uniquely prepared. The service was pretty good. Overall, we had a great adventure indulging in French cuisine."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a foodie friend so it's been on my Montreal to-do list.  I would recommend making reservations at least two weeks in advanced if you'd like to have dinner at a reasonable time. Twice I've made the mistake of not making reservations ahead of time and was left with the choice of having dinner at 5pm or 11pm. You'd likely be hard pressed to find seating as a walk in, don't even try if you're more than 2 people. They do not do online reservations so my recommendation would be to see if your hotel or credit card concierge can make the reservation for you if you're visiting from the States. The place is incredibly lively and space is at a premium. Everyone, from staff to patrons, seemed to be having a great time.  The food did live up to the expectations, I'll admit, but with some rather significant missteps. The food is rich, hardy, and will likely lull you into a post-dinner stupor afterwards. We shared the fois gras poutine as an appetizer which was excellent. The duck magret in mushroom sauce was also perfectly done. Although, if I could do it again I likely would have chosen the Duck in a Can which seemed to be a favorite. The Happy Pork Chop looked amazing when I saw it being brought to a neighboring table so I decided I would order it. Unfortunately, mine was raw in the center and I had to send i back to the kitchen. For dessert we had the Milkshake XXX, which has maple liquer, and the Choco Pie. Both of which were great ways to cap off an already rich meal.   Sadly, our service was quite poor that evening. Our waiter was consistently disappearing to other tables despite the fact he would literally pass us whenever he went to the kitchen. We were left to piecemeal our service by flagging down other staff for help because he rarely would return to check up on us. Had to ask someone else for more sparkling water and had to ask another waiter just for bread. At the end of the meal we literally had to point out there was an available credit card machine because our waiter was ready to do another disappearing act as soon as he left the check at our table."}
{"text":"Prepare yourself for a ridiculous, over the top overindulgence, followed by a food coma. There are 4 appetizer, 2 main meals and 2 dessert dishes. Luckily, they give out doggy bags so you get to take your leftovers home. The menu changes every year and it's really genius! The combination of flavours puts such a modern twist on this cabane a sucre. It's quite pricey though, so you'll leave with an empty wallet, but a very very full belly!  Update to 2016: they make their own gin now. It's pretty darn good with some maple syrup and champagne."}
{"text":"What's up with the hype?! It's not that good! In montreal, I have been to other places that's way way better and way way way cheaper than this place!   For duck in a can, it costs 44$ and 1/3 of duck was fat!   Not going back,  really don't need to come back since montreal has much better place with better price."}
{"text":"unapologetically and obscenely decadent. this is a pilgrimage that every lover of foie gras and all things pork should make at least once in their lifetime. it is everything that you would expect: the experience of ingredients so dripping with awesome that even large, burly dudes suddenly begin to fear for the future state of their arteries. just like it sounds guys, dripping with awesome.  i don't remember anything of the fine wine which we drank on that day except that it was red, and it was good, and there was a lot of it. A shot of whiskey prior to the meal is encouraged, like an offering to the gods and an act of submission. and the laughter, amazement, and groans of pleasure with each course is a part of the pied de cochon experience, just about the best part of this restaurant, and the reason why it was worth every single solitary calorie. so onto the food. we began our journey with an order of the foie gras cromesquis: three cubes of the most delicious liquid foie you've ever known. piping hot when they arrive at the table, the waiter warned that we should wait two minutes prior to consumption and consume in one big bite. my bite was ecstasy- breaking into the outer fried crust gave way to straight up hot liquid pleasure. If you don't start out with this appetizer, you'll deeply regret it. other dishes following this bite were also wonderful, although the star of the other three we ordered was the guinea hen liver mousse. a creamy fuschia-toned concoction arrives at the table, neatly packed in a small jar, and sealed with a layer of fat. pickled onions and a sweet shot glass of jelly are meant to top your spread of liver on crisped baguette slices. it was a perfect little appetizer to share, right down to the last bite. the piglet roast, thin slices of loin topped with a luscious sauce of confit of tuna mixed into mayonnaise, was excellent, as were the slices of tangy, tender pickled tongue with spicy mustard.  and so after a couple bathroom breaks (note the strategically placed tv in the restroom: so thoughtful) and a little more wine, arrived the entrees. the best of the three we ordered? the duck in the can. i don't need to wax poetic on how a savory mess out of a can can be so remarkably delicious. the perfectly cooked, medium rare duck breast combined with a generous slice of foie, and an unsuspectingly delicious concoction of cooked shredded cabbage was memorable to say the least. its arrival at the table is an event, and that first bite of duck, foie, cabbage, and a bit of the toast and puree below is one of those euphoric events that is never forgotten, and sought after for the rest of your culinary expeditions. our other excellent entrees included the foie gras duo, and the boudin and foie gras tart. the foie gras duo includes both the foie gras poutine and the foie gras burger. the poutine was wonderful, comfort food elevated to ridiculousness. that creamy foie gras rich gravy is unforgettable. the burger is the obscene part. sloppy, difficult to consume, but you will try! oh how you will try! after consuming a quarter of the burger, i recall my dining companions desperately trying to pick at pieces of lettuce, desperate for vegetables after the onslaught of fatty tummy saturation...whatever that means. the boudin tart was also good, though i think it was the redheaded step child of the group of entrees. still great, but overshadowed by the other two, and maybe a little heavy on the mustard. but i do love anything with boudin... i'd put it on my ice cream if i didn't gross people out so much. keeling over from happiness, we felt obligated to order one dessert, and opted for their maple syrup hot pot cake. i honestly can't remember what the hell this was called. but i do know that it was sugary, warm, melt in your mouth wonderful. just ask for a dessert that would fit that description. i assure you that the wait staff, perhaps the most amiable i've ever encountered, will be happy to oblige. my goodness, i can't say enough. i, like you, have had a lot of bad meals in my life, lots of hype followed by some sunken-shoulder disappointment. this was not one of those meals. did it exceed my expectations? nope. i expected heaven, and i got it. to recap, make sure you order the foie gras comesquis, the guinea hen liver mousse, the duck in the can, and the maple syrup hot pot thing. ask lots of questions, and just enjoy yourself. and pass out afterwards with happy thoughts of ducks and pigs that died for a good cause. i love this restaurant."}
{"text":"A palace of meats. We were steered here by someone acquainted with the city who had declared it his favorite restaurant in the world. I came in excited for the bison ribs, only to see the last rack of the night carried away as we were seated. I ended up with a pork chop and cider, she went for the sea bass.   The quality, the service, and the price were all aligned. I would not come through Montreal without stopping here again. You'll need a reservation, and should probably skip the previous meal to prepare. Some items are prepared in advance and they will run out as the evening goes on."}
{"text":"You must book reservation in advance if want to eat here - it takes about 2 weeks to get table. Nevertheless, nice experience, unique recipes and cool staff. Really enjoyed everything, but I have to say that the poutine is overhyped - it is good, but don't go there just for that because you will be missing out on some really regal stuff.  If you are booking solo or with a friend try booking for the bar section that is right in front of the kitchen - so you get courtside seats to the show. When reserving just ask for \"Bar Centrale\"."}
{"text":"This year's Moroccan (Fall 2018) inspiration might leave many disgruntled by an enmity of spices and impetus use of saffron. Only the appetizers may gloat your taste buds, but as the meal goes on your palate might morosely fall to disappointment; even to some of the specially concocted cocktails. However, the presentation is regal on every aspect throughout. This season has fallen short to the hype."}
{"text":"You need to try everything once. The food was delicious, the presentation was exquisite, we had a great time. The portions were huge, the food is not healthy, and you need a line of credit to pay for dinner. However, it was worth the experience!"}
{"text":"It's possible that I visited on an off night, but what's definite is that I had perhaps the worst service I've ever experienced at Au Pied de Cochon on Thursday night. My table was seated about 15 minutes late for a 10:30 reservation, which is fine in and of itself, but in this particular case it meant just the first of several occasions on which my party would be asked to assume the position by the restaurant, its staff and management.   After being seated, we waited about 30 minutes before someone bothered to swing by and ask us if we'd like anything to drink besides water. It was maybe another 20 minutes before the waiter came by and told us about the specials and maybe another 10 before he came back to take our orders. I'd normally chalk this up to a busy night, but when another table in our group received their appetizers before we ordered (same waiter), I started to get aggravated.   They apologized for the wait and gave us a few glasses of RosÃ© to make up for it. I thought we were cool at that point, but then it got worse.  After taking down the wine, we received our entrees.  I got the happy pork chop, which apparently comes served with au jus. I found this out the hard way, when the server spilled it on me. Twice. Their response was to awkwardly offer me a t-shirt and free dry cleaning. When we explained that this was insufficient, the conversation eventually spiraled into a discussion of what we believed an appropriate response would be (comp at least part of the bill) and their opinion that this was excessive compensation for my soiled shirt and that we should go F ourselves. We didn't get out of there until about 1:15am and I couldn't have been more eager to leave.   Now, I go to a lot of restaurants. A lot. I generally feel like service is of secondary or tertiary importance, but that's probably because I've never had service so comically poor. The guys in the back of the house do a pretty good job, as I think everyone in our party had an acceptable meal. It's a shame those in the front of the house did everything in their power to overshadow this effort with their god awful performance.  I'm not going to tell anyone that they shouldn't go to this place because of my terrible experience, but I'd be remiss if all anyone ever saw were 4 and 5 star reviews. I definitely won't be returning, and my shirts thank me for it."}
{"text":"Insanely heartfully tasty!! Worth the long walk, it was just soooo good!! Anybody who is going to Montreal, this restaurant is a must go!!! I read all the reviews about this restaurant and noticed a lot of people rate them very high, so I had a very high expectation, nonetheless, I was not disappointed and I was very impressed by their service, food quality, taste, venue from head to toe!! I give them a 6 stars and 2 thumbs up!!  We order Terragon bison tongue and tomato tartlet for appertizer, bison tongue just soo tender and it almost melt in your mouth!! tomato tartlet is very good alone (but if it's being compared to the bison tongue, tonuge is better)  Yes, I agreed with many of the viewer, foie gras poutine is to died for!! rich taste!! Price is not bad for a big piece of foie gras, there's no where in Calgary you can eat something like this (sorry Calgary!!)   And the \"Duck in the Can\" was just in heaven!! I just can't use any words to describe how good it was, mouth watering taste fill with rich flavours, duck, foie gras, cabbage, garlic, thyme.... just so good..   I wish I have more room for other dishes (they are famous for pork!) and dessert, I guess next time, I would definitely go back here next time in Montreal!!  Again, if you are going to Montreal, check them out, be sure to make reservation! :D"}
{"text":"YUMMMMIEEEEEEE!!!! Make reservations early! This placed is packed everyday they are open. We managed to get reservations for 5:30 in the evening - it's a bit early for dinner but we were happy to get a table.   Foie Gras Poutine - OMG! This was so good. The gravy was delicious the cheese curds, beyond expectation, the foie gras was seared to perfection.   Crab Pie - Flaky and buttery pie crust filled with layers of scalloped potatoes, cream sauce, tons of stone crab meat, and topped with green salad. The combination was to DIE for. I wanted to finish everything but could not manage. The portion size astronomical.   Steak Frites - If you like Bison, you will enjoy this dish. Cooked rare with mushrooms and onions in a wine reduction. The main dish also comes with a tall cone of frites.   Butter Cake Pudding - This dessert was a bit too sweet and buttery for our taste. We may have enjoyed it more if we actually had room for dessert.   Over all I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for fantastic, no fuss french contemporary cuisine."}
{"text":"Solid and quality food. Absolutely adored! Service was second to none."}
{"text":"I visited Au Pied de Cochon with a group of friends and had a wonderful experience. I started with the Foie Gras Poutine. This was some of the best poutine I have ever tried. The French fries were soft with a little crispiness and topped with rich gravy, creamy cheese curds and a generous portion of melt in your mouth Foie Gras. For the entrÃ©e I had the Duck in a Can. The duck was tender and stuffed with a slab of creamy Foie Gras and braised in a flavorful rich sauce. Overall, Au Pied de Cochon is a great choice for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a business trip last week and was very pleased.    We started with the cromesquis de fois grau which included two that were a single bite each - considering this, the price seems a little steep however I can assure you they were the best single bite I think I've ever had in my life. Awesome!  We also had some tasty beers and the fish and chips with the duck fat frites - the fish was perfectly cooked and very tender and the fries were great as well.  I can't forget to mention that our server was exceptional and took great care of us also.  Overall a great experience - next time we will definitely have to try more fois!!!"}
{"text":"There was a poutine Ã  la foie gras and other meat products.  Being a vegetarian, I can only review the beverages.  The water but a bit overpriced, I would just to a fountain instead .... The water is the only thing I would want when I am on Mount Royal.  The camion au pied de Cochon  should take into consideration that it is mostly health conscious people that hang out at the mountain.  Mount Royal 3$ for water versus Central Park  1 $ ,water  me think not I will come again"}
{"text":"J'hÃ©sitait de venir Ã  cette restaurant. Ãtre musulmane qui n'a jamais mÃªme toucher le porc. (Seulement un fois quand j'ai travaillÃ© au Mcdo pour une Ã©tÃ© ) mais il y avait tellement des bon revues,  mÃªme des \"yelpers\" que  j'ai rencontrer Ã  New Jersey et New York m'ont parler de cette restaurant.  L'ambiance : C'est vraiment cool et trÃ¨s montrÃ©alais. La musique est tranquille. Pas trop de bruit, tout les serveurs sont charmants et souriants.   Le repas:  Tomate tatare : Flocon pÃ¢tisserie mixÃ©s avec in pizza, qui rappelait mon ami de la nourriture authentique de Liban . Le frais pain de la maison Ã©tait servie avec beaucoup de beurre fraÃ®che.  Le mets principale Ã  pris beaucoup de temps pour arriver. Au moins les servers Ã©taient trÃ¨s attentives avec le pain et l'eau. Un cas spÃ©ciale , on ne pouvait pas manger le porcs pour des raisons religieux.   Le poisson panneau avec salade et frites. Le repas mÃ©ritait l'attend.   La prÃ©sentation Ã©tait fabuleux! tout le corps de poisson includant la tÃªte Ã©tait servie. Ce qui est important pour dÃ©montrer le respect Ã  l'animal qu'on mange, j'Ã©tais pas capable de la manger (trop de pain) mais j'ai apprÃ©ciÃ© l'effort qui a Ã©tÃ© mis dans la prÃ©sentation du repas.  Je retournerai Ã  ici mais seulement pour manger une salade.    I heard so much about this restaurant from my fellow helpers in New Jersey and New York, I have to see this place for myself.  The atmosphere was cool and very MontrÃ©al like feel to it. It was kind of refreshing for myself because I usually eat at vegan restaurants in the plateau. It was a nice to be in a carnivorous setting. The staff was friendly. They were very attentive and always smiling.  The food was great. The tomato tartare was a mix between a pastry and a pizza, a bit flaky but not dry. Fish was pretty cool, I did not eat it because I ate too much bread, but the presentation was awesome. I really thought it was cool that the head of the fish was there because to me that shows respect to the animal. It's important when you eat meat to acknowledge that an animal was sacrificed so you could eat that meal.  I would definitely come again and recommend this place to all my meat eating friends."}
{"text":"4.2 Stars  Dishes Ordered: Cromesquis de Foie Gras, Pied de Chacon farci au Foie Gras, Carpaccio de Canard  Amazing: Cromesquis de Foie Gras: Little foie gras croquettes that pop in your mouth. It feels like a French take on Xiao Long Bao (Chinese Soup Dumplings). Dish is actually insane.  Standard: Pied de Chacon farci au Foie Gras: Really good pork leg served on a bed of Pommes Aligot (the cheese/mashed potato mixture) with a slice of foie on top. Interesting array of textures and flavors. Flavors are reminiscent of Chinese Red Braised Pork.  Bad: Carpaccio de Canard: Way too heavy. The flavors are there but it was drenched in Olive Oil."}
{"text":"Great foie gras experience, super tasty, but can get a little overwhelming. Foie gras is on everything! Known for the duck in a can foie gras topping, but I only found it okay. Liked foie gras by itself, pan seared with some sort of fig/fruit jam more. Come on an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"We came to Montreal to experience the cuisine, and this restaurant especially. We were not disappointed. The atmosphere is busy and lively and the service was fantastic. The food was beyond expectation. I ordered a special that was duck confit cannelloni with sliced duck. My girlfriend ordered the duck margarite with mushroom sauce. Both were absolutely fantastic"}
{"text":"On the opening day of the project, I had the chance to head to Victoria Square to try out Camion Au Pied de Cochon. Now I realize that this will be the 4th post I write about Au Pied de Cochon and its various off spring. The reason is quite simple... I love them that much!   The concept they are going for is salty and sweet. You order in the front and from there, you pick up your items from either the salty window and the sweet window. The menu is an blend of dishes from the Duluth restaurant, the Sugar Shack and some unique truck items.   I went for their big combo option with an added item. That item was a fried duck leg with maple syrup BBQ sauce. Anyone who went to the Sugar Shack this past spring got a taste of this particular item. Nice tangy BBQ on top of some great duck. Nice crispy exterior while still keeping some moistness inside. Great option for only 3$!  The combo box itself contained four times - a maple soda, a foie gras poutine, a \"beigne Cochon\" and a \"beigne sucrÃ©\". The maple soda was nice and refreshing with just the right amount of maple syrup flavor to make it sweet but not overbearingly so. This was one of the components of the Whiskey Soda I had up at the Sugar Shack.... Still the best one I have ever had.  Next up, the foie gras poutine - their old restaurant classic and signature dish. If you've had it there then you know what to expect. They succeeded in translating perfectly to the food truck. Crisp golden fries, cheese curds, a piece of foie gras and their foie gras gravy - perfect in the restaurant and perfect here.  Now for the new stuff. The \"beigne Cochon\" really stretches the definition of a doughnut. In reality, this is a smoked meat sandwich where a doughnut is the bun. Yeah.... You read that right... A doughnut bun. Picard and his team are just nuts man. Anyway, this sandwich was amazing. A very generous portion of pork smoked meat, white ham and pork tongue with some mustard sandwiched in between that doughnut. Great combination as the doughnut mimics a sort of brioche bread. Nice and golden with a good crust yet a soft interior. The perfect way to differentiate themselves in this food truck rush.  For the \"beigne sucrÃ©\", they take the exact same doughnut but then stuff it with a filling of your choice and then add powered sugar. In my case, I went for the rhubarb option. Stuffed to the gills with a cream and rhubarb filling, the doughnut, which had been perfect for a sandwich, became a wonderful sweet treat to cap off the meal.  A very strong entry to the food truck world by the Au Pied de Cochon crew. Keeps in line with their \"go big or go home\" style of food all while adding some new twists for the truck. Very generous portions at a reasonable deal overall I think. If this is indicative of what we can expect from this generation of Montreal food trucks, we will all be very lucky people.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"When one talks of Montreal culinary institutions, one quickly arrives at Au Pied de Cochon, chef Martin Picard's ode to all things rich and decadent. From his roughly 80 seat space on Duluth Street East, he has built up a following which had allowed him to develop a culinary empire from his Cabane Ã  Sucre and subsequent Tele-Quebec series to his now award-winning cookbook. His restaurant has, thanks to satisfied customers, food critics, fellow chefs and even some famous friends (Anthony Bourdain has sung his praises on many a TV show), become a don't miss experience for food enthusiasts worldwide who visit Montreal. Despite all of this and even being a local resident, I had never the chance to eat there.   The first thing you realize when you walk in is just how compact the restaurant actually is. Typical of the Plateau neighborhood, the space is deeper than wide and they use all the space they have to its maximal capacity. Even the wine cellar is a cramped side room with bottles stacked on both sides. The space is clean with wood used as the only real accents in the dining room.  Our 5 person party decided to take a \"tapas\" approach to the evening to allow us to enjoy as much of the food as possible. For starters, we got the Cromesquis de Foie Gras. What a start to our meal. Bite-sized fried balls of foie gras which simply explode in your mouth when you bit into them. Little bundles of gluttony.  Next up, Accras de morue with a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce. Pretty much the best morue croquettes I've ever had. Beautiful crispy crust and loads of delicious morue inside, these were perfect as a starter.  Duck Carpaccio. After the 2 fried items, this was a wonderfully light and fresh dish. A little olive oil, balsamic vinegar, some onions and a egg plus some beautiful quality duck meat. Great simple dish that I would eat again and again.  Chicken wings with a maple syrup BBQ sauce. The wings themselves were good but the clear star here is that sauce. Deep in flavor with the right balance of sweet and spicy, this sauce would perfectly coat the back of your spoon when you went in to scope up the leftover sauce once the wings were gone. That plate didn't have a spot of sauce left on it when it was removed from the table.  Homemade gnocchi with ricotta and pulled pork. Just a heck of a dish. Soft and rich gnocchi with the addition of some dynamite pulled pork. The ricotta added a nice creaminess as well to the dish.  And after all of that, we were only done with the appetizers! Next up were the main courses. First up, the restaurant's version of a Montecristo sandwich. Stacks of fatty pork shoulder with melted cheese between two pieces of bread that were fried in what I suspect was duck fat but I forgot to ask. Either way, this was a cardiologist's worse nightmare. For the rest of us, it was shear heaven. Every ingredient on its own was amazing but put together..... Sweet sweet music.  PlottÃ© of pork shoulder, loin and hearts. Delicious rich broth to soak bread into. Great pieces of pork to enjoy. A very old school and hearty dish to enjoy. Likely the perfect course for a cold evening.   Foie gras poutine. The classic dish of Au Pied de Cochon. Boy did it not disappoint. The plate lasted all of 5 minutes between the five of us. The first you notice is the color and thickness of the gravy. This is no ordinary gravy - anything with foie gras in it could never be characterized as ordinary. The foie gras sauce adds a whole other level of richness to an already rich and heavy dish in poutine. Officially now my favorite poutine ever. And that is saying a lot given my love for Chuck Hughes' lobster poutine.  A Parmentier. Think shepherd's pie without the corn but of course, there is more to it than that with Au Pied de Cochon. Pulled pork base covered with their version of mashed potatoes - potatoes, cream, butter, cheddar and foie gras incorporated in. The whole thing baked off. The potatoes are to die for... And just may I have destroyed any further mashed potatoes I have at any other restaurant from here on out.   And finally, the tarte de boudin avec foie gras au sel. Flaky pastry crust with potatoes, caramelized onions, boudin and foie gras. Perfect blend of textures and flavors. Flaky and soft. Salty and sweet. Very nice way to cap off the main courses.  This meal was everything I had expected and more. You know you've had an epic meal when your server comes up partway through the meal, sees the lack of leftovers and goes \"You guys are crazy\". It was that kind of night and given my experience at the Cabane Ã  Sucre PDC, I wouldn't have expected anything else. I officially have a new entry in my top 3 Montreal restaurants. And it was a long time coming.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Fall is sadly here (speaking as a true Summer baby here). The air getting crisper, the leaves are changing colours and it is getting a heck of a lot darker when we all wake up in the morning. However, there are a few positives... and Martin Picard &amp; company opening up their Cabane Ã  Sucre is definitely one of them. Earlier this year, I got to visit for the first time for sugar season. Following that experience, I made sure that I would be back for the fall apple season menu as well.  First up, there was a nice selection of special cocktails to try out. The options were an apple Martini, a raspberry Margarita, an apple cranberry &amp; spiced rum slush and lastly, an Irish car bomb variant with apple cider, apple brandy and creme de cassis.  And now onto the food. The first course brought forth a huge amount of dishes: an apple pie topped with cheddar cheese, foie gras and an optional chives cream; a seasonal vegetable soup with pork, chicken, shark and a housemade pesto sauce; sauteed apples with noix de grenoble; a squash risotto with sausage mixed in a cheese wheel and salad still in pots with the vinaigrette sprayed onto it. Not a single bad dish amongst the group. The apple pie was flaky and sweet. The foie gras was the proverbial icing on the cake. The vegetable soup was nice and hearty with a beautiful deep and flavourful broth. The presentation of the salad was quite original and good as well. The sauteed apples brought some nice sweetness to the mix and the risotto was perfectly executed - the mixing in the cheese wheel really helped to create that rich texture.     And then the main course came up - a meat plate that bordered on the absurb. A mountain of different meats with housemade sauerkraut that was left to ferment for 6 weeks. White ham, pork tongue, smoked meat, bacon, liver, dry sausages, apple and foie gras sausage, pork tenderloin and a pig's foot. Everything on this plate was delicious - great use of different types of meats and preparations. This may not be everybody's thing but I loved it.   Paired with the meat dish was a cheese plate. I don't remember the names of each cheese here but other than the blue cheese (which I don't mind in a dish but not by itself), I enjoyed all of them. Similar to the meat plate, there are a great mix of textures and flavours within the plate. Add to it fresh onion rolls, baguettes and crackers and you get a great side-dish to all those meats.  Last but not least, we get to dessert. Dark beer and squash soft serve ice cream, squash &amp; honey millefeuille and powdered doughnuts stuffed with homemade apple sauce. Now, I know that squash ice cream and a squash millefeuille seem weird but both were amazing. Both soft serves were simply perfect in terms of consistency and richness. The doughnuts were odes to their food truck and, like those you can get there, were delicious although it prefer a little less powdered sugar personally. The millefeuille was perfectly done as well.  Once again, as it was during the spring, the amount of food you get for the fixed price (50$ for the fall) is insane. Compared to the spring, I would say that this menu is more accessible given its relative lack of offal and other non-typical food items. Either way, I enjoyed this meal very much and rolled myself home - all while saying I'll be back next year. Pretty much exactly what expected from the Au Pied de Cochon crew.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Alert: Richness overload ahead  In the quest of finding the best poutine in Montreal, I stumbled on one of the most iconic places in Montreal (my friend and Food networks seem to swear by it..so here goes).   Foie gras on its own? yes! Poutine on its own? yes! Foie gras & poutine together? Why Not?   Brace yourself for what could possibly one of the richest flavored food ever! This rich, unctuous delicacy is only served at Au Pied du Cochon! I remembered fries swimming in gravy deliciousness (with the cheese curds) and a generous chunks of foie gras on it! The foie gras added an additional richness elements to an already rich dish..to some extent a bit redundant.  Bottom line/Final Verdict: instead of getting the best poutine ever, I got the richest poutine ever! But does it mean necessarily richest = the bestest? Not necessarily. But it's a pretty interesting take on poutine. A little too rich for my liking (I'm poutined up! Possibly because this dish is so rich that it just bump you to the limit of poutine quota), but still it does not take a way the fact that is a solid dish, and at CAD 24 plus tax this is the most luxurious poutine I ever had (more than I'd like to spend on poutine)  PS: This is only based on take out experience. Be sure to make reservation way ahead of time if you want to dine in here! It seems to be always packed and not sure they let you in without one!"}
{"text":"Ate at the PDC back in September and it was absolutely incredible. Had to make reservations a couple months ahead of time but definitely worth it. And I recommend that you make reservations as soon as you figure out when you're going to Montreal. Our reservations were at 7:30 and I over heard the waitress tell some walk-ins that they MIGHT be able to get them in for 10pm...at the bar. Portions are enormous. My boyfriend and I ordered two appetizers: Crispy PDC salad and Piglet Roast, one entree: PDC melting pot - this had mashed potatoes, blood sausage, homemade pork sausage, and porkloin, and a dessert: Creme brulee, and we were stuffed til the next day. You definitely do not need to get your own dish. Plus, sharing is caring!   As for the service; surprisingly super friendly and efficient especially for such a busy restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Quite unfortunate some people had a bad time here. This place has been consistently busy since they have opened, obviously they are doing something right."}
{"text":"AprÃ¨s 3 ans d'essais infructueux, nous avons enfin rÃ©ussi Ã  avoir nos places Ã  la cabane. Nous Ã©tions 14 et avons choisi la table du chef, situÃ©e directement dans la cuisine.  C'Ã©tait en fin d'hiver, il pleuvait, le stationnement (en terre) Ã©tait dÃ©gueulasse, plein de bosses, de trous remplis d'eau, bref, mes chaussures et mon pantalon Ã©taient bien sales avant mÃªme d'entrer dans la cabane.  Comme nous Ã©tions dans la cuisine, nous avons pu regarder l'Ã©quipe Ã  l'oeuvre, et il faut avouer qu'ils ont vraiment du plaisir Ã  faire leur travail. La moyenne d'Ã¢ge est basse, mais ils savent ce qu'ils font. Nous avons pu fournir un iPod avec une playlist (variÃ©e, mais du bon son).  Ensuite, l'orgie a commencÃ©. Orgie est vraiment le mot appropriÃ©, tant la quantitÃ© de bouffe Ã©tait simplement hallucinante. Je ne saurais honnÃªtement pas dire ce que nous avons mangÃ©, mais c'Ã©tait bon. TrÃ¨s bon. Mais impossible de tout finir. Je crois que nous sommes repartis avec 7 ou 8 doggy bags.  Les \"highlights\" de MA soirÃ©e (nous Ã©tions 14, je ne sais pas ce que chacun a prÃ©fÃ©rÃ©) : le foie gras entier gavÃ© au sirop d'Ã©rable, la tourtiÃ¨re, les croÃ»tons Ã  l'ail gÃ©ants, les pÃ¢tes Ã  l'encre de seiche.  Ãa nous a coÃ»tÃ© en moyenne 200$ par personne (cocktail, repas, cafÃ©s, alcool).  C'est \"raisonnable\" compte tenu de la renommÃ©e de la place, mais Ã§a reste cher pour de la bouffe de cabane Ã  sucre, mÃªme si c'est loin des habituels bacon/oeufs/saucisses.  Est-ce que j'y retournerais ? SÃ»rement car le menu change chaque annÃ©e. Est-ce que je reprendrais la table du chef ? Non, c'est trop de bouffe, trop cher.  J'ai aimÃ© ce que j'ai mangÃ©, mais je prÃ©fÃ¨re moins gras et plus gastronomique.  Cela dit, c'est une expÃ©rience Ã  essayer au moins une fois !"}
{"text":"Always hesitant to give a place five stars, but oh man, the food here is so good.  We had two of the specials: clams and cauliflower in cream sauce and bone marrow with caviar. Both were freakin delicious. The clams were fresh and perfectly cooked. The bone marrow was decadent. I wasn't sure I would like it with the caviar, but the flavors were perfect together.  Also had the foie gras (forgot which one, but it had maple syrup in it) and fries made with duck fat. Yum yum yum.  We figured that we should order the pied de cochon-- I mean, the restaurant is named for it, so it had to be good. It was. However, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, and by the time we got the pig, we were stuffed. Stuffed. We had to get it wrapped up to go, and we ate it for lunch the next day. It kept very well! (note: the mashed potatoes that accompanied it were amazing.)  The service was OK. Our server was really warm and welcoming, and he really knew his stuff (and he was super handsome). But it was a pretty busy Saturday night, so it was difficult to catch his attention at times.  A few final things. Make reservations weeks in advance. The floor is slippery. I will definitely be back if I ever find myself in Montreal again."}

{"text":"I have never given five stars to a restaurant I've been only once, but if any restaurant deserves it, it's Au Pied de Cochon. I was THAT impressed with the restaurant! Perfect from start to finish. One of the owners took our drink orders (not Martin Picard, unfortunately, but extremely nice) and the bread and butter was brought out shortly. Oh, that butter! Even their butter is amazing, obviously from a local, superior source, served with rustic bread. I can only think of one other restaurant (Eleven Madison Park in NYC) where bread and butter were so memorable. We ordered foie gras cromesquis and tomato tartlets for appetizer, both were amazing. Especially cromesquis, I'd never had anything like that in my life -- that feeling of warm, intense foie gras flavor exploding in your mouth! Had boudin and foie gras tart and the famous Duck in a Can for entree, again both were AMAZING. Both dishes had SO much foie gras in/on it! Every bite was simply heavenly. Sorry to use such cheesy language, but I have no better way to express it. That Duck in a Can had so many flavors melding together that it was dizzying! And that boudin and foie gras tart with BIG chunks of each strewn all over... it's enough to give me an orgasm now. Even the dessert was amazing (I know, if I say \"amazing\" one more time in this review...) We ordered pudding chomeur, which arrived boiling and smelling intensely of maple syrup! It was sheer torture waiting for it to cool down, but when it did... so simple yet so freakin' delicious. I am SO making that for dessert this Christmas. Even though I begged the owner to open a franchise in New York, I'm glad there's nothing like that around here. Otherwise I would go there weekly and weigh 400 pounds! Seriously, one of the most amazing meals in my life and all that amazing food for around $150 for two. This is officially one of my favorite restaurants in the WORLD and I canNOT wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went to Pied du Cochon just because, as a Montrealer, I thought I should give it a chance.  I was very disappointed and do not recommend to friends or tourists visiting, unless you want to spend a fortune only to leave feeling super heavy and disgusting.  All the meals are way too rich and heavy.  There are so many other wonderful restaurants in Montreal where the dishes are much more elegant and calorie intake isn't through the roof.  The ambience also lacks genuineness, feels like a tourist trap, service was lousy, and the chefs seem overworked/stressed.  Definitely would not go again."}
{"text":"At Au Pied de Cochon, you will most likely experience the heaviest meal of your life. From the foie gras dishes to the duck in a can, everything is over-the-top indulgent. We decided to get a tuna confit salad and a tuna steak (the special of the day) to balance out the meat, but even the tuna steak was really, really heavy.   If I had to pick my route to a heart attack though, I'd go with the foie gras poutine. It was godly... definitely a must-order at this restaurant.  Knocking off a star because of the horrendous wait time to get seated. We had an 8:30 reservation on a Saturday night but didn't end up getting seated until about 9:10. The hostess seemed like she didn't really know what she was doing, because all the reservations were backed up and there was a line going out the door. Lesson learned: don't come here at a peak time on a weekend."}
{"text":"WARNING - This place is not for: 1. Vegetarians (this is not up for debate - period) 2. Those watching their caloric intake. If you are on weight watchers you will spend a week's worth of points (I calculated about 80 (or more) for the meal that we ate). 3. Those who take a political stance against the use of Foie Gras in any form 4. Those for religious reasons will not eat pork (actually there are other options, but you will be in the minority) 5. Anyone who is on a budget I Ok, now down to business. I called the day before and got a reservation for the next night at 10:30PM.   We requested the bar and were seated directly in front of the open kitchen where the sauces were made and all dishes were finished before being set in the window to be expedited.  The atmosphere is animated and loud. The staff is attentive but not intrusive and we chatted with the chef's occasionally because there were a few things we could not identify, they were very accommodating.    First up (besides the yummy bread and butter):  Salad (yes, I admit we were pretending to have a balanced meal, this was a farce in itself).  A smattering of lettuce and tomato tossed with a vinaigrette and topped off with lovely chunks of pork/fat bits (bacon?) and this lovely fried square of cartilage etc (tasted like hogs head cheese).  Not salty at all and a good way to \"ease on down the road.\"  At this point we are not bowled over but happy with what we were eating.   Next, a server inquired...\"did you order the Foie Gras Cromesquis?\"  Qui! Our instructions: \"Please let this cool for 2 - 3 minutes and then put the whole cube in your mouth and bite but keep your mouth closed.\"  Ok, got it.  So out first comes the dish of Bone Marrow we ordered, cooked with a hint of maple and smeared with a luxurious dose of caviar.  This was declared better than sex by my dining companion (the chef laughed - I wasn't sure I was going to make that kind of a substitution).  I can tell you this was creamier than any marrow I have ever tasted with the perfect balance of sweet and salt from the syrup and caviar.  Can you tell I am dreaming of this marrow?  In any event as we were savoring this delicacy the fried foie gras cubes emerge on a tiny wooden plate.  We want to dive right in but know that we have to wait the 2 - 3 minutes...no problem...plenty of time to really get into that bone marrow.  If we weren't in public I would have grabbed that bone and licked it.  NOTE: Marrow is not for everyone.  It is almost like eating butter.  At this point we are ready for the foie gras cubes so we each popped one in our mouths.  It is completely liquid inside (I can just imagine how someone would be scalded who didn't wait the prescribed 2 - 3 minutes for these babies to cool down!). Buttery, smoky, with a crunchy outside this was so delicious what a shame that you only get two in an order!  Simply beautiful.  At this point we were both grinning (while keeping the mouth closed!) and trying to prevent that taste from disappearing from our taste buds too fast.  Next?  The famous Foie Gras Poutine.  I have had poutine elsewhere - it wasn't bad - basically a highfalutin disco fry.  Neither one of us thought this dish would be anything special, um WRONG.  The fries were the perfect amount of crisp (well they better be, fried in duck fat), the chunks of foie gras and cheese curds sprinkled on top with 2 of the most amazing gravies poured over the top.  FYI, the gravy takes about 3 days to make! I just didn't want this dish to end.  I also didn't want to part with that gravy.  It was so rich it would have gone well with biscuits (instead of country gravy) or grits, fried chicken just about anything southern that you can conjure up.  Needless to say, I will only each poutine if Chef Martin Picard has something to do with the recipe.  Next course was the Happy Pork Chop and the indubitable, Duck in a Can(Canard en Conserve).  The duck is quite flavorful but I mirror another person's account - I don't think it is their best item on the menu.  I think my Happy Pork Chop might be a contender though.  Looks like something out of the Flintstones with this huge rib bone sticking off the plate.  Perhaps this is a subliminal encouragement to just grab it with your hand and start gnawing away.  This ultra-tender chop was brimming over with mushrooms in a lovely burgundy gravy.  Both the duck and the pork have so many layers of flavor (and duck fat...) I was quite beside myself and ended up packing the remainder to take home.  We also ordered asparagus and mashed potatoes on the side.  The mashed potatoes were filled with cheesy goodness.  This should be on everyone's Christmas Dinner menu. We had just enough room for a light dessert of poached pear with vanilla ice cream.  The liquid from the pear was so delicious I wish I could have bottled it, added Prosecco and served it as a refreshing brunch drink.    Go Hungry.  Leave Happy!"}
{"text":"Got very lucky to tag along with a friend who had made a reservation one year ago to get in. Given that piece of information, I was expecting it to be good.  It exceeded expectations.  It's out in the sticks -- took us an hour to drive out from downtown Montreal. The setting is fantastic (it feels like a big converted farm house).  Then the food starts coming out.  This isn't just holy cow. This is holy barn yard animal. Absolutely epic. I've never had so much food of this high a quality just brought out... and then it just keeps coming out. More and more. It's all amazing. It's wholesome, extremely rich, and not complicated.  I ate so much, I didn't need breakfast. I'd do it again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We first went to Au Pied de Cochon over 6 years ago. I made the reservation in advance but we were lost and could not find the restaurant. I kept calling the restaurant and let them know that we were late. When we finally got there, almost 1.5 hour later, the restaurant was packed and there was a long line waiting. To our surprise, they kept our table! We were seated right away and the waiter was very patient to explain the menu. We both ordered an appetizer and an entrÃ©e with a glass of wine. The food was incredibly good and the price was reasonable. It becomes a must-go every time we visit Montreal.   Over the years, I have tried most of their foie gras dishes (except for the pork foot stuffed with foie gras, which is too large for one person and I don't have any one to share with), also the venison tartar; my husband has tried most their game dishes, and we have never been disappointed.   My recommendations: 1) Make a reservation or get there early. 2) Avoid the special or be prepared for a sticker shock (my husband ordered their special once; the dish was good but it was much more expensive than the items on the menu.) 3) Check out their wine cellar-- they have a very impressive wine cellar in the back. If you like foie gras, wild game, or a nice bottle of wine to go with your meal, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"We got the poutine foie gras and duck in a can - it was fantastic!!!! So good! I could see why Andrew Zimmern and Anthony Bourdain raved about this place. It's seriously super delicious and a great way to get a taste of the delicious culture here!"}
{"text":"I was taken here for my birthday on my 2nd visit to Montreal. The city overall has such amazing food and Au Pied de Cochon is one of the best of them. As you may have read from previous reviews, the floor is little slippery. It was raining out and I was a bit concerned I was about to doing a triple lux inside the restaurant and fall but just walk slowly. You are going to want to walk slowly anyway to take in all the smells. It is magical inside the restaurant.   We sat down and ordered appetizers and drinks. The Foie Gras Poutine was amazing. My girlfriend had the french onion soup. I had some of it and it was very tasty. After appetizers and rounds of drinks we did wait almost 45min to an hour for the entrees to come out. Honestly, that would really bother me any other time but after that first round of food I am not mad. I ordered the pied de cochon with stuffed with foie gras. Yeah just think about that for a minute. There really isnt anything to say. It was one of the most amazing dishes I have ever had. First of all the serving size was like 8 people. It was huge. Everything just melted together when you bit into the meat. It sat on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes. My girlfriends cousin had a bison beef rib. It literally looked like the rib they threw on Fred Flintstones car and made it tip over.  My girlfriend had Duck In A Can. I don't know how they put that idea together but it was the best duck I have ever tasted.   We didn't order any dessert after dinner but there were some interesting items on the dessert menu. A few minutes later the owner Martin Picard made an appearance. Said hello and shook his hand. Had a round of shots after that as well. Great guy.   This is a must visit restaurant in Montreal. I can't wait to come back and try Martin Picard's other food venue The Sugar Shack."}
{"text":"Rich, delicious, expensive, cozy. Au Pied De Cochon is all of these things.  This was our pick for the only fancy dinner  we'd have in Montreal, and I have no regrets there. The great thing about this restaurant is that it feels very casual and cozy. No snobbiness here.  Things we ordered:  * Duck in a Can: Seems to be a popular dish, and yes it really comes in a can. The result is a big bowl of richness. Make sure you order some bread or something else on the side to give your taste buds a break.  * Lamb Shank: Way better than Duck in a Can in my opinion. Again, another rich dish but there's all sorts of other things (like some awesome tomatoes) to have fun with.  For appetizers we had the foie gras (excellent) and some beef carpaccio (OK). I could have skipped out on the latter to make more space for the entrees. Which reminds me... The entrees are very big, so don't get crazy ordering a bunch of appetizers.  Also note, the difference between appetizers and the starters... starters are one bite each.  Great place for a memorable dinner, but be prepared to splurge."}
{"text":"If you're like me, you live in a culinary desert (aka Topeka, KS) and you sit and watch the Travel Channel or Anthony Bourdain visit exotic locations full of wonderful cuisine and you hope and you dream and you WAIT. And once in a while when you've saved your pennies you go on a journey (I like to call them quests) and you get to experience the best that artisans have to offer.  Last night was another of those times. I'll spare you the details of describing the fantastic Cromesquis de foie gras or table-side carved Jambon Canane. Suffice to say they were excellent, but not what I came for. My wife, who does not share my zeal for all things animal and fat and skin and connective tissue had the halibut. It was reportedly quite nice. But again, not what I drove 1400 miles for.   It was the namesake that I sought. A glorious and enormous piece of swine trotter. Baked in their brick oven, \"stuffed\" with foie gras and blanketed with an epic mushroom and herb gravy over mashed potatoes. I can count on one hand the meals I have enjoyed so immensely.   Tonight I am finishing the remains of what mere mortals could not consume in one sitting with a nice baguette and contemplating my return for an encore!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Ordered the bison tongue, eel with bone marrow, poutine with foie gras, and veal tartare. All of which were perfectly cooked. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I actually can't believe I only gave this place four stars last year. I think I reviewed it too quickly after going and was still flabbergasted by all of the uneaten food, but it's been over a week... and I'm already ready for next season.   Twelve(ish) divine courses, peppered with some delicious drinks, shots and glasses of wine with friends. Standouts this year were the hot and sour soup (complete with much meat and maple), the chef's meat pie, the pig's head with pancakes, the pineapple ice cream dessert, the good ol' maple on ice and absinth with maple sugar.   My motley crew traveled from near and far to join in these sugar shack festivities and we were not disappointed. We opted to take a stretch limo from Montreal where we were all staying to ensure optimum coolness and so that everyone could drink until their maple soaked heart was content. If you are someone that likes being super cool like me, I recommend you lean into the extravaganza that is a dinner at Cabane a Sucre Au Pied De Cochon and get a limo, too. Also, ask your server if you can saber a champagne bottle with a lumberjack ax, if you have two fellas as charismatic as Jon and Ruggy, she will let you.   A bientot!"}
{"text":"No better place to spend a cold winters evening/night than in Au Pied de Cochon. I'm pretty sure that you can't order a single thing from here that will disappoint but I can promise that if you do order the Duck carpaccio the foie gras poutine, foie gras hamburger or the duck in a can you'll leave having experienced one of the best meals you ever had and I'm pretty sure that goes for everything that Au Pied de Cochon has on their menu. Great experience and great service every time I have been and a place that I'll keep going back to every chance I get"}
{"text":"Wow.   Carnivores delight!!!   We tried so many wonderful dishes.  The Shepard Pie was good, as was the Lamb and the Ravioli was divine.  My fav was the Pate and the Foie Gras. Divine.    The desserts were equally as yummy."}

{"text":"I remember seeing a review where the guy said  \" Anyone who rate this place under 5 stars doesn't know what he is talking about\" I totally agree with him although .. every one is entitled to their opinion ... I think 65$ for this insane amount of food ... created by a well know chef .!!! Is a steal .!!! From my first visit in 2011 .. i have only missed 2 years ... and i intent to go every year .!!! I also happen to like foie gras ... and what better place for foie gras than at PDC?  So let me get back to the 65$ menu ... 14 dishes in total .. and what you can not finish ( who could? ) They encourage you to take left overs home ... they supply the dishes .!! 14 courses of insane amount of food.... am sure one day i will end up in a food coma.!!! I don't know what i prefer the most ... the maple sirup hommage cabane a sucre ... or the apples / apple cider.... season .... which they held from august to October. To any and every foodie out there ... is not a question of its for you or not ...IT'S A MUST .!!! Where else have you seen that the reservation is an event on it self? You need to plan your visit 4 to 5 months ahead .!!!  I too think this place doesn't deserve anything less than 5 stars ... Chef Martin Piccard ( when there ) is always very friendly and open to pictures .!!!! This place and a very few more deserve the total of 5 stars and nothing less !!!!"}
{"text":"Oh so good but oh so freaking heavy. Everything we sampled was amazing but my god the stuffed pigs' feet was easily the heaviest dish I've ever had. In life. This thing could've knocked out a small mammal.   I think it's worth a shot to check this place out but this is almost a bachelor party kind of meal and would be pretty ideal for 5-6 guys to just feast in."}
{"text":"This place has been a Montreal classic and I was excited to try it. But I guess I was being an ignorant American and thought I could come for dinner on a Thursday (around 6pm) without a reservation. I was greeted at the entrance by a hostess that was less than happy that I did not speak French then looked as if I insulted her when I apologized I did not have reservation. Eventually our party was seated at the bar but we were told we would have to leave within 1.5 hrs. Ok, that's fine. I was actually happy to get a table at the bar which was right in front of the kitchen so we got to see everything being made, that was the best part of this experience. Server was also very nice as well and was not at all rude like the hostess.   We ordered some foie gras dishes, boudin, and a pied de cochon, the first few bites were delicious but as you continued, it tasted all very one note. Everything tasted like onions and butter, nothing wrong with that just hard to eat an entire plate of it. Although we didn't order it, the pig's head for two looked amazing (an entire pig's head with two knives sticking out of it sitting on a bed of mashed potatoes) and could probably feed 4 people. Was glad I came since it is such an institution, but would not want to come back."}
{"text":"Un des meilleur repas et meilleure soirÃ©e dans un resto montrÃ©alais Ã  Vie. Le service a Ã©tÃ© hors paire et j'ai adorÃ© l'ambiance et la vibe de la place!!"}
{"text":"Overrated and greasy. Nothing special about this place- not sure what the media hype is all about. We sampled everything from  duck, pig leg etc. Their foi gras is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The pictures I took speak for themselves.  Where else can you get a whole pig head with cow tongue and heirloom carrots.  The (french) onion soup, tuna collar with grilled onions and corn and great wine selection make this restaurant a must stop when you're in Montreal.  The seating is cramped inside the restaurant and they have a small restroom for the size of this restaurant but not that big of a deal given all else."}
{"text":"This place is amazing; a meal to remember for sure. Bustling and very male dominated clientele. Had the pigs head with an accompanying lobster. Superb..! Came with two sauces, the best mashed potatoes I've had, along with asparagus and fiddleheads. We were told it takes an hour; was actually 45 min. Had a starter but not necessary as the crusty bread and butter is excellent and the potion size huge. At $80 for two it was s bargain. The crispy skin was perfectly done; the meat oh so tender. And the lobster was a good size.. Would have been a meal for one on its own.   We reserved well ahead ( Sat. Of Grand Prix) bit had to wait at the bar for a table. This place is busy for a reason.   Would definitely recommend and try the foie great next time."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I am usually highly dissapointed by these Bourdain-hyped restaurants.  Au pied de cochon is the rare exception that did not fail.  The beers, especially their namesake are awesome and very reasonably priced.  The ambiance is very casual but still nice enough to take the wife.  We started with the cromesquis which were two small balls of fried foie.  Totally awesome as an amuse bouche.  We then shared the foie gras poutine which was ungodly good and the best poutine we had our entire stay in Quebec.   However, I do wish there were more fries to go along with the large portions of foie, curds, and gravy.  We ended up dipping our bread in the foie/curds/gravy to finish it off.  We ordered the pied de cochon and PDC's melting pot.  The pied de cochon (pigs foot) was fantastic and was served with extremely rich and cheesy mashed potatoes.  The meat was crisp and covered in this oniony thick sauce which was a delight.  The PDC melting pot had blood sausage, regular sausage, pork chop, pork belly and was also quite nice.  Nothing to write home about, but the blood sausage and mashed potatoes were great in this dish.  I remain curious about the duck in a can, but after a horrible duck experience the day before at another restaurant, we were not willing to fork out $45 for something that could be a bust.  Will definitely be back to try to other menu items!"}
{"text":"Ouf! TrÃ¨s cher succulent.indigeste quasiment tellement que c'est gras. Resto bruyant et pas chic. J'y suis allÃ© par curiositÃ© il y a des annÃ©es."}
{"text":"Malade ! best experience ever. Service excellent, description des mets parfait, et la bouffe........just wow Excellent rapport qualitÃ© prix"}
{"text":"I couldn't leave Montreal without coming here, I wouldn't forgive myself. I was a broke student so I decided to come here with friend and order one main dish, one appetizer. Then the price wouldn't be so bad.  Ok let's see.... I really wanted the foie gras poutine but the waiter came over to tell me Pain De Veau was the daily special! Damn it I can't afford two mains!! Well whatever I guess I'll just have to return.  Pain de veau is a French dish and it's basically veal bread. Something I never heard of! At Au Pied de Cochon they made this with red wine, a lot of veal, some roquette leaves on top, AND FOIE GRAS. Of course FG. I'm not missing out.  It's VERY flavourful, in fact really strong. It's extremely good!   For the appetizer we ordered duck carpaccio $14, which is raw duck, mushrooms, cheese, egg yolk, dots of colours (sauces). And you mix all this together. It tasted more sour than duck which, to be honest, is usually what westerners do: cover up raw stuff with sour stuff. So you're tasting just the sauce. I would pass if this doesn't interest you. I personally would order something else next time.  I think in total it was just $34 + tax and tips.  SERVICE! Extremely good!!! I fell in love with the other waiter, not ours. Ours was amazing too. Please don't be jealous, hear me out. The other guy was just freaking nice and alive!!!! I think he works in the back (I sat near the door) and he brings food to the table. He doesn't take customer orders, he brings food from kitchen to table. But because the restaurant is ALWAYS so busy, he naturally helps out everything! Water. Changing tables. Checking up. Are we ok?? Napkins? Coming ASAP!!  The only awful staff is the coat lady who's at the front of the door and she takes in new customers. I guess it's good I mean, her face just tells people without reservations to get out.  Which reminds me. If you have no reservations, you'll be greeted by her and get kicked out. YOU NEED reservations."}
{"text":"Decadent, delicious and pricey. With exceptional food comes exceptional cost and if you're up for it this place is worth it. Tucked on a side street among other cool little shops and eateries, this restaurant has a great vibe from the moment you walk in. Staff is attentive and fun. Menu consists of just about everything to quench the taste buds of your inner carnivore. Fois Gras has its own place on the menu and is front and centre to the dining experience. We had a bunch of little apps and some bigger ones too and then gave in to the temptation of 90 day aged Wagyu steak. The sauces that accompany the dishes will have you using your finger as a spatula to get out every last bit. If you have room or even if you don't, order the sugar pie for dessert. Every bite at Au Pied du Cochon demands a moment of quiet reflection as your eyes roll back in your head."}
{"text":"Great place to get the foie gras. I think especially being from the States. It's incredibly cheap and good portions and so much variety. Just watch for the richness of that all, ordering a pork leg after appetizers and the foie gras is highly not advised . But they do have a great selection of beers and wine to cut the fat. The only disappointment was the dessert, way too sweet and fatty. After the rich meal like this all you want is something light and fresh. Oh and of course do makes reservation, it gets very busy"}
{"text":"You know, this may have been the biggest disappointments of my Montreal trip, not because it's terrible but because it simply did not live up to the hype. 4.5*? Not at all, in my experience.   The positives: The free bread was incredible, the portion sizes were beyond generous, and the prices were very reasonable.  The negatives: Everything was too rich (it's hard for me to frame this as a negative but when you start eating the food, you realize it's just too heavy). The $22 \"Pied de Cochon\" came with the richest mashed potatoes and fried thing on top and very hearty sauce underneath. The huge piece of meat would've been enough for dinner for a family. It felt like a chore to eat it because on the one hand, I didn't want to be wasteful but on the other hand, how could anyone eat something so heavy?  I'm clearly in the minority here but it just wasn't an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Too many times to count this is the classic place, only thing to add is try going there and sitting at the bar if you can, it will give you a very different feel for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great spot however most of the items we wanted to try were sold out. Such as the lasagna, which you should clearly try if possible because it seems like a bestseller. If you've never tried French expect to experience a lot of rich dishes."}
{"text":"Perfect if you are trying to commit suicide by food! Too much food, too much mixing too many things, wayyyy to heavy and greasy. It's like trying too hard to make cabane a sucre experience too fancy. Layering sugar and fat and salt. Overkill. You leave feeling lethargic. The ambiance is nice yes, and it's exciting at first because of how hiped up the place is, how long in advance you have to make a reservation to get a spot, and the wait.  After the second serving I was full and ready to leave. It's also quite a pricey sugar shack experience. My feelings were echoed by other friends that also went to the shack (at different occasions)."}
{"text":"I have been dying to go here for literally years and it was everything I had hyped it up to be and more. The service was extremely good and our waiter's recommendations were given heavy weight when it came down to order from this overwhelmingly awesome menu.  We started with the plogue a Champlain--an amazing sweet and salty blend of I still don't know what. Next up, one of the specials of the day, aged prosciutto which was particularly fatty and delicious. And for the main course, duck in a can with a side of duck fat fries. If my arteries clogged today (which they might), I will still die happy."}
{"text":"Better then anything u can get in NYC !!!  If your in Montreal its not to be missed.   The owner raises his own pigs and grows and taps his own maple syrup.  If you love Foie gras you will love it here.  Make reservations way in advance it gets really crowded.  Best seats in the house are at the bar in front of the chefs.  Im not going to gusha about it but is awesome on all counts.  Best food in North america."}
{"text":"Had the duck fries (meh) everything else was spectacular. Duck in a can was a must, unique and delicious. Lamb shank was tender yet lean. We also had the tuna tartare, which was ideal. Caught a quick glimpse of the owner, somewhat like seeing a famous ghost. Great meal and worth the money"}
