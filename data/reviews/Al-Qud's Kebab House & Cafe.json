{"text":"I LOVE Indian food - especially Indian buffets - and this is my new favourite. The buffet is $12.99 all day and the selection is exactly as previous reviewers outlined. Butter chicken isn't usually my go-to item, but I went back for three servings. The chicken was wonderful - not rubbery at all, unlike many other places I've tried. The chicken biryani was the best I've had. The rice pudding was also wonderful (incredibly sweet, but I like that). Both the biryani and rice pudding had full cardamom pods, which lend an incredible flavour burst when you bite into them. The service was basically nonexistent (our plates weren't removed until we left), but that's okay - it's a buffet. My partner didn't love the food as much as I did, so it's probably a matter of personal preference, but I thought everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"I was on the train Downtown with my friend, when he suggested this place.  We went in for their lunch buffet at $13.

Quite a good selection for their price: biryani rice, goat curry, tandoori chicken, Naan, beef kebab, butter chicken, veggie pakoras.  I didn't try their fruit salad or rice pudding but my friend said they were alright.

I ate two plates of food and liked the biryani rice, goat curry and tandoori chicken.

My friend enjoyed his meal too.

For the price, I give this place 4 stars.

The only thing I didn't like were the unsavory characters loitering around outside.

I think I'll take the train to this place after workout sessions where I don't feel like cooking after.  Stuff my belly up."}
{"text":"Fantastic indian buffet, and its Halaal!! you cant complain for all you can eat for 12.99 right?? try it out you wont regret it"}
{"text":"I saw this place while on ctrain, exterior was not so attractive but decide to give it a try...price was $ 12.99...I must say, they surprised me...food quality was great, a good range of items includes but not limited to chicken biriyani, butter nan, plain rice, beef kabab, chicken tikka, goat curry, butter chicken, daal, mixed vegetable etc. There were fruit custard in desert...

Food was delicious and service was excellent as well, a must try for food lovers who loves middle eastern and Indian style..."}
{"text":"So I'm not quite sure what to say about this place, as a sheltered Calgarian who grew up in the burbs. This \"restaurant\" or Cafe or whatever is by crackmacs on 8th st 7th ave, off of the C-train line. It's the kind of ghetto place I wouldn't dare walk past, much less step foot in. 

So it was a surprise to me when I decided on a whim to check out their Indian food buffet, which is $15 all day. 

In fact, the whole experience was a surprise - the place was mostly empty but the owner / host was very friendly and welcoming. the Buffet selection is average, but it's pretty good! They use real chicken breast for their butter chicken, and the Chicken Briyani was very good! 

For such a low price, it's really hard to complain. While I don't think I'll visit again in the near future, it's really not bad for food in a bind."}
{"text":"All the good Indian buffets downtown have disappeared. Shehnai is a distant memory. Glory of India was good, once upon a time. Green Chili has no buffet anymore. Neither does Moti Mahal.

Enter Al-Qud's. It's on the retail level of an apartment tower, where the old 8 LRT platform was, around the corner from the infamous Mac's at 8 and 8 SW. So it's not the most beautiful part of downtown. But I was lured in by the strong reviews and the promise of all-I-can-eat Indian for a measly (by Calgary standards) $13. 

Great decision. The buffet wasn't overflowing with selection but was there was good- really good. Chicken biryani was excellent. Naan is made in a tandoor and is all you can eat- great naan, lovely texture. The pakora kadhai was rich and very nice. But most surprising was that damn butter chicken. NOBODY makes it good anymore, nobody in or near downtown at least. Letdown after letdown, it always tastes of dry chicken and campbell's tomato soup. Not this one- the gravy isn't cloying sweet and it has some fire. It's fantastic with the naam. Thinking about my dinner there I wish I'd eaten more- there was goat curry and channa masala on offer too. Next time."}
{"text":"Great selection of buffet items for only $13! It's an all day buffet so go ahead and give it a try :)"}
