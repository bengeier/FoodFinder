{"text":"This is one of Calgary's gems. Hit it at noon and there's a good chance you'll be eating next to a City Councillor or two. Great service. Great prices. HOT bowls."}
{"text":"I work across the street, so I visit this resto often as there are not a lot of options in the area.  Food:  I love a stone bowl, and their's hits the spot, even though it's not the best I've had in Calgary. The Korean pancake is yummy, and when I asked nicely they made it for me for breakfast, even though it's a lunch dish. The spicy pork, chicken teriyaki, and miso are all ok, but not the best. The quality seems to go down when you get takeout vs. eating in, and it's best to go early as things seem to run out after 1 to 1:30 pm.  My friend orders breakfast and says it's good too.  Service:  Adequate and usually very friendly.  Atmosphere: A nice place to eat alone or with colleagues.   Question: Is it just me or is the quality slipping a bit recently?"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot in downtown Calgary with a nice mix of Korean and Canadian food. The bul go gi and the club sandwich are favourites of mine, but I've never had anything short of delicious. Food comes out quickly, and the staff are incomparably friendly and accommodative. Don't forget to try their free samples of the Korean pancakes."}
{"text":"When I want a quick lighter lunch I get a Korean pancake to go. Very good but only a vegetarian version I would like if maybe there was one that included a protein such as shrimp or spicy beef - that is just my preference and no reflection as to how good the pancakes are. Like the Korean subs too but I usually take my break after lunch rush and usually no buns left - that is how I camE to like thd pancakes. I need to try a stone bowl sometime but the servings look very filling. Decent value."}
{"text":"Food here was OK. My stone bowl came with a ton of beef, far more than I needed, but it was a little stringy. I'd rather go with a little less meat of higher quality."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean place! I wouldn't mind driving 45 minutes to eat here! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was there with my mate this afternoon for lunch. He had  The chicken teriyaki which look good because I sat there and watched him eat it all while I waited for my clubhouse sandwich. I watched everybody else getting served I really didn't think it took A half hour to make a sandwich. That I had to ask to take to go. By the time I got back to the office it was cold and soggy I will never go back to this place"}
{"text":"I went here with some of the work crew for lunch today and tried the spicy pork stone bowl. Very yum! We did arrive after the lunch hour so some of the items on the menu were unavailable/needing time to prepare. This made our decision a little easier, and was still fantastic!  I'll be back to try more items out, and maybe a little earlier to get a better selection!"}
{"text":"Terrible, really wanted to like this place but food inconsistent because everything is just rushed. Jap Chae now comes out barely warm and cashier not too bright. I don't actually complain in there but they know they messed up and constantly apologizes. I come back a week later and they just as incompetent. Any positive reviews must have been posted awhile ago but I just can't give them anymore chances. I really hope they have some competition and go out of business because staff just not trying to improve."}
{"text":"Nice owner. Enjoyed the food. I wanted to get an appetizer with meat to accompany my main dish but they had just opened that day so didn't have everything available so the owner offered some dumplings on the house. (Don't expect this every time haha) Very kind!"}
{"text":"This is a very belated review.  About a year ago (didn't I say \"belated\"?) I arrived in Calgary for a job interview.  Afterwards, I took a friend out for Korean food at Stone Bowl.  We arrived about 20-30 minutes before closing so the place was empty except for the guy at the front and his friend.  He took our orders and was very accommodating (I swapped out the meat for tofu in my bibimbap and omitted the egg).  My friend and I had a nice chat about our day, only to be surprised when the guy started locking up.  We had no idea that closing time was so soon.  But he told us to please stay, take our time, and eat.  Then he did something very sweet - he gave us some beers on the house and a box each of Pocky, also on the house.  And he wished us well in our efforts to get a job in Calgary.  The one thing he did that didn't jive well with me was when he kept trying to matchmake me with his friend.  That was awkward!  I haven't been back since I moved here because I'm able to cook similar things at home, but I might be interested in going again during a non-busy hour."}
{"text":"This is my first review for Yelp. The owner was moved into this location from one inside Rocky Mountain Plaza. He took the opportunity to revamp the menu and add many more Korean and ethnic dishes. Everything I have had is great and it's a good price too. Today I had a teriyaki chicken sub, Vietnamese style, there was a nice amount of spice and the ingredients were all fresh and plentiful.  Open on Saturdays I believe as well as during the week. So if you're near Olympic Plaza, the Central Library, or City Hall and feel like having a bite to eat, check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. My co-workers and I drop by here for lunch. Portions are much bigger if you eat in. In regards to soup option in the combos, I'd pick the spicy beef over the miso broth.   The stone bowl with egg, chicken teriyaki and lunch combos satisfy. The Korean pancake is delicious and makes for a great snack. Food is made with care. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Oh man is this place good. Totally reasonably priced. Fresh and yummy. It's a good bet to pay the little extra to get it in the hot stone bowl. It cooks the egg real nice and keeps everything warm and sizzling. They are so friendly. I wish the line ups didnt get so long at lunch hour but still. Worth It!"}
{"text":"2018.04.17. My friend and I went downtown Calgary. We found the Korean Restaurant right across the street from Calgary Public Library. The name of the restaurant is Stone Bowl Korean Cuisine. It was our first time having food at this place. It's a small Korean Restaurant, located at 615 Macleod Trail SE, Calgary. We arrived the restaurant around 12 pm which was right on their lunchtime. There are many people inside the restaurant. My friend and I have ordered different combos for lunch. I had spicy pork stone bowl with spicy beef soup. My friend ordered beef stone bowl with miso soup. After we ordered the food, we found a table to sit down. The soup came out the kitchen fast, but they were not hot. We waited for our stone bowls for while. They were well cooked and boiling hot. The stone bowls were very tasty and delicious. We enjoyed it. Highly Recommend this place for stone bowls. Do not order their soup. The soup was not hot and fresh"}
{"text":"I was in good spirits before I stepped foot into stone bowl.  Stone bowl used to be one of my favourite places to eat.  The croissant sandwich was my favourite, it was incredible.  Today when I arrived it was all new staff who informed me that I was not able to get the croissant sandwich because it was \"breakfast\" and they don't serve it after 11am.  I told them they must be new because I would come here quite frequently and order it, never before noon.  Whatever excuse they gave me about not wanting to plug in the machine which toasts the croissant is bullshit.  The inconvenient parking, the peanut gallery of homeless people harassing me on the short walk to the restaurant all do not at all seem worth going here anymore.  I am severely disappointed and I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"So I checked out Stone Bowl on a whim, as I had decided to catch up with an old friend for lunch that day and happened to be in the area. I'm definitely a fan of Korean food so I was happy to hear about a well rated Korean place I hadn't tried before.   As far as lunch goes, this place is fairly cheap - It's a sit-down restaurant in which you order and pay first and they deliver it to you. The d√©cor is simple and reasonable for a quick easy lunch, and the menu is short and to the point. I decided to go to for the bulgogi plate with soup, running $11.75. The Bulgogi plate was great for quantity - a good amount of bulgogi beef, seasoned flavoured rice, a salad, and glass noodles on the side. The soup I chose was spicy beef.   The soup was pretty good and hit the spot for sure, but was nothing more special than a simple broth with a bit of beef and veggies (spicy). The bulgogi plate also had some pretty solid flavours, but nothing really stood out. The beef and rice were served a bit lukewarm, which wasn't inspiring, and the salad had too little dressing and was otherwise bland. Same story with the glass noodles - average flavor.   However, one cannot expect a quick, simple, and cheap lunch place to blow your tastebuds away - and if we take into consideration the context as a quick, cheap, decent lunch, I 100% believe that this place stacks up better than many of your other options (think, food court, where you can easily spend $12). I'd definitely visit again for a work lunch or if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this on a weekend.   Service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Thought I would give this place a try since its nice and close to work. Ordered some take out teriyaki chicken (#3) it was delish!! Chicken was nice and tender and teriyaki flavour was good. I see they also have a breakfast menu.....Ill be back!"}
{"text":"I am amazed. I like this place. Definitely in a good location but not too central central downtown where it gets so busy during lunch time. I went on Yelp to look for Korean food and this place popped up. It was 10 mins from work. But I don't mind walking. Menu is quite limited. But I guess they only serve what they are good at.  I got the beef bi-bim-bap and I have to say\" Portion size was good Ingredients fresh Price very reasonable. Tasted very yummy.  The stone bowl had couple of meat options: Chicken, Beef, Vegetables only etc and spicy and non spicy.  The lunch combo came with soup if you decide to make it a combo for about two dollar more.  I like this place. Walked out full.   Good service even thought its like food court style."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT. There were open today (Canada Day) and I stopped in, preferring not to brave the 50-deep lineups for food trucks at Fort Calgary, and am thrilled that I did. I got the spicy chicken with rice, glass noodles with beef, one perfect, delectable mandu (fried dumpling) and a few delicious pieces of green onion pancake, and a side of the most addictive sweet spicy pickles, house made. It was stunningly delicious- rich, deep flavour with a bit of spice. Everything on my plate was fantastic- and it was the unbelievable price of $8.95. I'd have paid twice that. This goes right onto my list of favourites."}
{"text":"This place is located in my office building so I go to lunch here quite often.  Full disclosure: I lived in Seoul for two years so I base all reviews of Korean food on our time in Korea. Quite frankly, no Korean restaurant in Calgary will ever match the quality, cheap price and character of a real Korean restaurant. But this place fits the bill for a good quality Korean lunch. As the restaurant name suggests, the house specialty is \"Dolsot Bibimbap\" -- bibimbap cooked in a hot stone bowl that you can get with chicken, beef, pork or tofu. My favorite dish is the spicy pork, rich with flavor. The portions are so big I often share a meal with my wife. Mr. Kim the owner is a super friendly dude too, and all the staff are friendly and attentive. Great value for the amount and quality of food you get. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Really great food. The rice had so much flavor to it. The staff were amazing, attentive and friendly! I defiantly recommend this place to all. Reasonably priced for the food you get! Will defiantly go back"}
