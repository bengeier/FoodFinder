{"text":"I came there last week. The staff there is nice, and they start to offer new meals to the customer. I was surprised because the taste is really good. I pretty sure they have changed the chief. It is a good place to have a break, and enjoy the meal with friends. Price is okay if comparing with other sports bar, but higher than normal restaurants."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"no words to say?a really terrible restaurant?low quality food with high price ?terrible service?I really suggest you do some research before you go to a restaruant like this"}
{"text":"We were the only table at dinner time. Food is below average quality, way too salty. The chicken wings are too salty, couldn't finish. Potato slides are too thick. Smaller portion for the price. Waitress is busy chatting with her friend over the phone, didn't even bring water to the table till we asked for it. Won't come again"}
{"text":"Slow service. Their skewers are smaller than other restaurants', and the price is similar. Therefore you are actually paying the premium price. Food was just soso. I guess a big part of my bill goes to their yonge finch rent instead of the food."}
{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant! They're scammers, they should really be shut down. We went in as a group of 4. When it was time to pay, the total was surprisingly high. We thought it was strange, but we looked at the receipt and it added it up. So we paid and even added a 20% tip. Before leaving, I decided to take a second look at the menu, and realized they actually added $1 to each item from the menu prices, and that was the amount on the receipt. I went back to the waitress and asked her about it, and she said the menu prices were wrong and didn't even attempt to fix this! The menu was already over priced as it was, they had the audacity to add $1 to each item thinking we wouldn't notice! I left the restaurant because I didn't want to get into an argument, and told my mom who was waiting outside. My mom was furious, and went back in to get our money back, and this time around, they said their machine is faulty. They are clearly aware of this, and trying to scam their customers! Also the food was awful, most of the skewers weren't even cooked."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for about 6 years now. When I moved in, this was a Korean cold noodle shop. Later they closed and it became a Korean Fried chicken shop. And now it's a chinese BBQ spot. This place is pretty tough to do business because it's in a hidden spot. Is the food here good enough to break away from this location's unlucky trend?    Well...It's not something I would come back for frequently. I find the prices can be a little high for the portion. If you work out the math, it's around $1+ per skewer. Which doesn't sound too bad but I'd have to eat a lot to feel full. But then again this could be more of a drinking and social place. So if you want to get stuffed on CBBQ, I would try maybe NCE near Yonge and Steeles. They have more menu selection too and more traditional dishes. It'll take a lot of skewers to feel full. You need some carb and this store doesn't have much in terms of main dishes.  The food tastes alright. If you've tried CBBQ then you already know the taste. It's good but it's not something extraordinarily good."}
{"text":"Give it 2.5 stars rounding down to a 2.. meaning it was ok, but I prefer to come back..  Typical Chinese lamb skewer place.. they have 2 kinds of lamb skewers, regular ones and fatty ones.. the fatty ones didn't taste flavourful..  nothing really special.. so i look at it as a marketing gimmick..  The sausage skewers were fail.. when done right, they should be juicy, flavourful, and crispy skin.. wasn't juicy and wasn't crispy. Right away told to BBQ it more, still didn't do the trick.. probably because the sausage casing was man-made as opposed to real intestine casing.. basically hot dogs versus sausages..  Enoki mushrooms were great! Chives were great! Soft-bone chicken knees were great!  But in my opinion, for one of these places to deserve praise, the lamb skewers must be great.. which they were just meh..  One unique item on the menu was lamb brain!! Never seen this item on a menu in GTA before.. gave it a try.. when it first came, i picked one up with a spoon and chopsticks. It smelt like lamb meat.. and therefore felt promising.. tasted like under-cooked Pork liver.. it didn't have much flavour.. and was mushy.. don't know how this is supposed to taste when prepared superb, but this didn't taste good.. we didn't finish it.. I might consider ordering this item again at a different restaurant if I do ever see it again..  Bill was $135 plus tip for 3 players..  Also, for a drinking place on Yonge street near Yonge and Finch.. this place is not trendy at all.. interior wasn't new.. old refurbished restaurant.. no tvs.. no atmosphere.. can't see this being a long-time thriving 4 star establishment in the future.."}
{"text":"I really love the authentic flavours here. The ambiance is a family style run restaurant but the food says it all. You must try the lamb skewers. The spices are really intense and much better than all the night markets I have been to. If you are in the area, check them out!"}
