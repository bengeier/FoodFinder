{"text":"Just ordered takeout through a third party app. One of our orders was missing so we called to see what they could do. They said they would send one right away. 10 min later our order of fish came. They threw in an extra piece of fish too! 5 stars! Thanks for fixing the mistake the driver should have had to!"}
{"text":"My fave fish and chips. Everything very fresh, especially the chips. Chips are nicely salted and crispy. Interesting menu and also good drink selection. I like that they will give you plates if you're going to eat in the park. Very nice staff."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fish and chips ever! Right on Queen West, this place is definitely worth the trek to Trinity Bellwoods. I ordered the soft shell crab and chips for $13. They made it fresh to order so the crab was piping hot. The batter wasn't too overly done and the well-done fries weren't burnt or crunchy nor were they too soft. It's a small restaurant and can fit about 10 people comfortably with their benches. It's a great place to grab a bite to eat before you go to the park or even take it with you there. The service was quick and the chef was great - made sure your experience was great and accounted for. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this place not expecting it to be as great as my first experience was. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly - I feel bad because I took packages of salt and pepper and didn't need them at all! Definitely a hidden gem. I ordered the soft shell crab and curly fries and will definitely go back to try something else. I suggest grabbing it to go and eat it across the street at Trinity Bellwoods for a nice experience to eat really good fried seafood and people watch"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I ordered with foodora and it was still hot, crisp and fresh! Big portion too"}
{"text":"Awesome traditional fish and chips. They even have mushy peas with garlic and Vanilla Coke! Friendly service and nice location across from park."}
{"text":"has got to be my favourite fish & chips joint in toronto. everything is so fresh and well prepared. I've been here multiple times for fish tacos and each time, the tacos had been consistently fresh, and delicious! everything is made to order  their onion rings are crunchy and delicious. the ginger beer is one of a kind  the service is excellent! i ordered 3 fish tacos through Feedback (3rd party app) and was given 1 taco when i arrived. to fix their mistake, they made me another 2 immediately and had given me bigger fish taco pieces - something they didn't need to do but did anyway. other restaurants should take a lesson from them"}
{"text":"All three stars go to the \"chips\" portion of my meal. When I go to fish n chips I focus on the key components of fish n chips- fish, batter, coleslaw, chips, and tartar. I got the cod and it was clearly frozen in a past life. The breading on it was subpar-- often falling apart. The coleslaw (which costs extra) was okay.. not sour, not creamy, not really consisting of much taste. The tartar was more creamy then sour and could have used a bit more relish. The fries, however, were crispy, fresh, and fried to a T.  I came in during lunch time on a week day and it was empty. It is close to work but I don't think I'll be going out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Yummmmms!  I finally got to try this place and I really really really enjoyed it.  The chips for me was the best part.  I ordered the haddock and chips, it took about 10 minutes I think, however it was piping hot and so so good I had to sit down at the side bar area to have some before heading black to work.  The store itself has very few sitting area but Trinity Bellwoods is right across the street so if you had more time, that would be lovely.  When I walked in there was one person in front of me and two ladies who were currently waiting for their food sitting by the window.  During the weekday, not too busy but steady and weekends I have seen lines.  So, the fish--to me it was good, possibly because I prefer halibut over haddock, however the batter was really good--it was not overly breaded or 'doughy' but crispy and tasty.  The fresh hot fries were so so so good, I really love fries and thoroughly enjoyed this with tartare and ketchup .  Greasy spoon?  Ofcourse it is but so worth it!    They are also btz friendly, 1500 btz for haddock or shrimp and chips and 400 for just chips.  I had a hat with the owner and he was super nice!  I really hope he is able to source yummy  but I'll definitely check out the new desserts he's been working on and hopefully the kimchi fries...  4/5 stars because I think they just need some updating for more comfortable seating area"}
