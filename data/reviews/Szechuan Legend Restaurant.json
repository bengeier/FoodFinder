{"text":"The best Szechuan anywhere!  Authentic food from Chengdu China. Best bets are Fish with Chili Garlic Sauce, Dan - Dan Noodles, Deep-fried Crispy Chicken ...you will thank me for these recommendations. Say hello to Nancy, the chef's wife, who is an excellent host who will ensure your experience lives up to the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Its a small place, with a not too impressive appearance, but its a hidden gem IMHO. Its surrounded by other big name restaurants (like Asian Legend) and probably overshadowed by them, but if you give it a chance you will not be disappointed....provided you like spicy food; if not, go somewhere else, or at least order wisely."}
{"text":"Best spicy wontons!!!!! Must try this unassuming spot. Great lunch specials and also a great spot for dinner. Reasonably priced and quick service."}
{"text":"Szechuan Legend is located at Midland and Finch, and it is about as close to authentic as you can get outside of Szechuan province in China.  Apparently they do Dim Sum but who cares, go for the hot stuff.  A must order dish is the sliced beef appetizer.  I could not find a photo of it but look around the room, someone will be having it.  The beef is slow braised and then cooled.  Once it is cold it is thinly sliced and server with a mix of chili peppers, green onions, peanuts and sesame oil. Fantastic!  but not for the faint of heart.  In fact, if you don't like spicy food then stay away from this place.  Another \"must have\" dish is the spicy poached fish, which luckily you'll find pictures of it here on Yelp.  This dish is intimidating, delightful and coy all at the same time.  When you first see the spices floating on top you might think there is no way you can eat it, but the poached fish hiding under the chilies and oil is divine. Ask for an extra plate or bowl and scoop out the chillies if you're too intimidated.  The \"cool off\" dish we usually get is mung bean noodles with cucumber and sesame sauce.  It is the perfect Yin to the spicy Yang of everything else. Be sure to order the \"Gong Bao ji Ding\"  (spicy chicken with peanuts and chillies) and lots of \"pijo\" (beer). You will definitely want the beer.  One word of warning however is the staff is Chinese, in a Chinese restaurant, filled with Chinese customers, in a Chinese part of town.  Don't be too upset if you need to repeat yourself several times to get your order understood.  I usually go with native Mandarin speakers so it's no problem but I have seen others struggle."}
{"text":"Beef wontons were okay, the fact that their excess pastry skin had to be noted in review doesn't say much. Beef pancakes were excellent. We also had a beef spices wrap that was great, but the dough is cheap and unforgiving to really wrap around the beef medley. Obviously we have a love for beef. Would I come back again? Well, the price point makes it worthwhile. :)"}
{"text":"We've been in this plaza dozens of times but never noticed this place until some friends suggested we give it a try. We came for dinner and ordered the dan dan noodle, cold noodle with special sauce, sweet and sour pork, spicy pig's feet, fresh chilly spicy lamb, and fish fillet in chili sauce. The noodles were absolutely delicious, and probably among the best I've ever had in my life. The pork and fish were also excellent, while the pig feet were good and the lamb was OK. This place isn't usually too busy which is also a bonus. I highly recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"LOVED their dan dan noodles, beef wraps and fish noodle! A restaurant that I will definitely return to again and again."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING! The reason for this review is to advertise how awesome the quality of food truely is. It might not be the best looking atmosphere, but it's a small cozy dine in with great food and kind service for each visit.   Must try: Dan Dan Noodles and Zhongs Dumplings. These dumplings are in a spicy sweet chilli oil. To die for!"}
{"text":"Love the food, music and service of this restaurant. In fact, I'm getting a group of friends to eat dinner at this place again tomorrow night. The chefs at this restaurant know what they're doing! If you want a great authentic Szechuan cuisine experience, look no more and just come to this restaurant.  It is a little bit pricier, but it's well worth it, trust me!"}
{"text":"This is typically not the restaurant I would visit; however, it was a good friend's recommendation.  I love the atmosphere here, the decor was simple and clean.  The servers were quite responsive and quite nice.    I was craving the fish cooked in spicy oil, and it sure did not disappoint.  The fish was supple and tender with just the right amount of spiciness /numbing sensation.  My only concern was that the amount of fish was quite enough.  The spicy sweet and sour beef was really interesting with crunchy texture paired with the wonderfully concoted sauce.   The string beans were well cooked with slight crunchiness and a nice seasoning.  The highlight for me was the spicy pig ears, and the texture was elastic and crunchy.  It maybe not the cup of tea for everyone, but sure did excite my tastebuds.    It was a nice touch for the place to offer some profiteroles filled with cream to cool our tastebuds after various spicy dishes.  This is one of the best restaurant I have had so far this year at this medium price range."}
{"text":"This place is a great Hunan/ Szechuan option in Toronto.  Food is really tasty. We ordered a few dishes, including a few fish dishes, lamb and a few veggie ones. All were great. You can actually get minimal spice level, which surprisingly is still really good. Portion size is good too.   The restaurant itself is fairly big, and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Having recently come back from a trip in Szechuan, I was craving some traditional Szechuan dishes.  Let's just get this out of the way: Szechuan dishes are known for being spicy. If you can't handle/don't like spicy food, this is not the place for you.   Service was pretty average - nothing spectacular and nothing off-putting. I didn't have to wait for a table for 2. I did have some difficulty communicating with the waitress (she spoke Mandarin and I do not). This isn't an issue when it comes to ordering though; the menu numbers each dish, has the English translation and pictures for the more popular items. They give you a piece of paper where you can just write down the menu number for the dishes you want.  I ordered 3 items off the menu (taking translations off of the receipt, as I forgot to take down the translation in the menu).   Beef in hot pot: the beef is very soft and tender. This dish uses Szechuan peppers, which cause a numbing effect. Probably my favourite dish there so far.   Dan Dan noodle: yummy noodles in a peanut sauce with some minced meat. It didn't taste spicy to me, but that may be because my mouth was already numb from the previous dish.  Spicy sliced pork: My least favourite of the three, but it was still a decent dish.  When I have a craving for spicy food, this will definitely be one of my go-to places!"}
{"text":"Szechuan Legend Restaurant is \"legen... wait for it... dary!\" I found this restaurant on my Yelp app while I was looking for good eats near Richmond Hill, Ontario. While it only had 13 reviews at the time, the photos were convincing enough.  The husband and I were given a regular menu as well as one for lunch specials. We opted to order from the regular menu as it had more choices and we wanted to try many dishes. We decided to order: fish fillet in chili sauce, fried cumin lamb, and the spicy fried cabbage.   - Fish Fillet in Chili Sauce: This is basically a white fish simmered in bucketful of hot chili oil and it goes so damn well with white rice! As overwhelming as it looks with a gazillion red chili peppers, it really isn't that spicy. I love that they don't go crazy with the peppercorns so your tongue isn't numb and you can really taste this dish. This is one of the most classic Szechuan dishes you can order. I always order this whenever I go to any Szechuan restaurants. This is the best rendition of \"shui zhu yu\" I've ever had. - Fried Cumin Lamb: The flavor of this lamb was sooo good but then again I love cumin anything! I think it would've been even more perfect if the lamb had a little bit of a crisped char. Delish! - Spicy Fried Cabbage: Simplicity at its best. Clean eating (at least what feels like it!) and fresh, the cabbage had a nice sweetness to it with just the slightest kick from the peppers. Thumbs up!  There were PLENTY of leftovers. YAY FOR DELICIOUS LEFTOVERS! We ordered one bowl of rice and a can of soda on top of the three family style dishes - total paid after tax and tip was $50. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"First time in this restaurant. We order the dumpling, Ma Pi tofu rice and a lamb noodles. The food was actually very good. The downside is there English isn't very good. Service was quick."}
{"text":"This is my favorite szechuan restaurant. Their Dan Dan noodle and grandma style spicy noodle are must eat items, full of rich spice aromas and so so good! I honestly haven't had anything I don't like at this restaurant. Their cold appetizers like husband and wife beef strips and cucumber jelly fish are very refreshing. Remember to order soya milk or a can of the Chinese cold herbal tea as they will help control the spiciness and keep you feeling refreshed when you enjoy your spicy meal.Their service is excellent, and I like their music and ambiance. It's one of those Chinese restaurants that is actually courteous to their customers."}
{"text":"If you like spicy(like really spicy), try Szechuan Legend. We had chilly fish, and while this dish was tasty with complex seasoning and flavours, it was way too spicy for me to enjoy. Also had crispy duck with pancake, not spicy at all but good alternative for kids. My favourite was the spicy beef with tripe and peanuts. This was delicious with the right amount of heat(for spicy lovers)  and very unique because it's a cold dish. It goes so well with warm white rice as it offsets the spiciness. I need to go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"If you're coming to this area, be ready to spend some time finding parking if it is on the evening. I tell you hwhat (Hank Hill voice).  My second time coming to this restaurant and the taste is consistent. We ordered the spicy beef in chili oil, fish hot pot and something else I can't remember because it has been a while and I can't remember what I had for lunch just 2 days ago.  Anyways, the beef was perfect, especially with the crunchy peanuts. Fish was OK for me if I dreamed it of all oil and numbing peppercorns. For Chinese people I'm sure the fish is better than OK since they love numbing peppercorns.  It's been almost 5 years and I am still not a fan of peppercorns. The beef had peppercorns, but they were smashed and I couldn't see large pieces of it. My gf is Chinese so she enjoyed everything.  Prices are reasonable too. Definitely recommend if you are in the area and have time to look for parking. Hangry people maybe avoid unless you can go in and secure a table while the other person finds parking."}
{"text":"Mala in the HOUSE! If you're looking for that tongue numbing Sichuan spice here's your spot!  The service was so nice, in fact our server helped us compose a traditional Sichuan menu for two which was so helpful!  Shui Zhu Fish: plump buttery fish, water boiled to perfection with SPICE!  Dan-Dan Noodles: a good starter to whet the appetite  Zhong Dumplings: AMAZING! It's ALL about the sauce.  Kung Pao Chicken: We're not big meat eaters but this dish delivered on our spice needs.  Next time, I think I'll wash it all down with an ice-cold beer, which they also offer.  I give Szechuan Legend a TOPS on flavour, variety, tradition, and great service."}
{"text":"Very tasty szechuan food. We always order the Deep Fried Spicy Crispy Chicken - I could live on this, there's some spice inside (or maybe its a part of the type of chilli they use) that tastes like it's exploding flavour into your mouth when you eat it, its indescribably delicious! Also great (we order every time we go) is the DanDan noodle and Zhong's Dumplings. I live in Montreal now, but I can't wait to visit Markham with my boyfriend so he can taste the chilli chicken!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to come here on Sunday night, but seeing the positive reviews I decided to give it a try.  We ordered three different noodle dishes and Zhong's dumplings. The servers were very friendly and told us to stir the noodles first in order for it to taste good. My favourites were the dan dan noodles (the peanut flavour over the spiciness - it's so good!) and Zhong's dumplings which have a sweet, spicy garlic-y sauce. The other dishes were a tad too spicy and oily for me.   I was also pleasantly surprised when they gave us a complementary dessert (ice cream puffs!) which was satisfying and cooling after a spicy meal. The bill came up to around $30 with tip.   If you like spicy food, definitely try out this place. I'd come back again when I'm around the area to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"We got the fish in chili and garlic sauce, tofu with pea shoots, and the beef noodle soup.   The tofu with pea shoots did not contain pea shoots, which was unfortunate. The vegetables in the dish were also lacking in quality.  The fish was really good though. It tasted fresh, the sauce had a nice kick to it.  The beef noodle soup's meat was tender, but the noodles and soup were mediocore."}
{"text":"I have no intention to go and have lunch at Szechuan Legend Restaurant. . but when I walked by and saw the lunch specials for $5.99.. that just pulled me in!!   Szechuan Legend is a newly opened restaurant at Commerce Gate, the same plaza as Asian Legend.   Lunch Serves from 11 - 3 pm   Beef and Noodle Soup ($5.99) with choice of Hot and Sour Soup or Soy Milk drink  - The soup based is so spicy.. sour spiciness with a touch of peppercorn! My lips were burning and my tummy was so warm and I was sweating when I eating this!!  - The Beef is the brisket type. So they are tender and soft  - Noodle is quite standard... but is the more doughy northern type   I love the great selections of lunch items here!! And I think the level of spiciness is the way it should be...it is as authentic as how Szechuan food should be like!!   Prices wise, they are really reasonable! And they have Grand Opening 10% off even for the lunch prices!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Absolutely fantastic. Had the kung app chicken, cold beef dish, rice and a Tsing Tao beer. Came out to $42. Price is reasonable and food is as authentic as it gets. If you want to experience authentic Sichuan cuisine and you're in Toronto, do yourself a favor and go to Richmond Hill and experience the bliss. 5 stars all day, son!"}
