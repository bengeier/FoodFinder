{"text":"Fried pickles and pimiento cheese fries to start for the table.  May have been overkill but they were pretty good.  Burgers were the main entree and hit the spot.  Small parking lot, but service was good."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Atmosphere funky and artsy. Staff good. Creative entrees prepared with care. I am giving it 5 stars even though the bathroom was outdated and not the freshest. Great place for people who like a funky vibe. Probably not for the uber conservative."}
{"text":"Wow what a surprise!!! Great ambiance the music rocks the service was outstanding !!! We got there at noon and there was a line with more then 30 people waiting !!! We had the crab puppies yum highly recommended , the rest on the food was also good but crab puppies were the highlight of the meal!! The servers were super friendly and helpful , we will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Do not order the hot dog. Not sure what it is made from but you won't like it. Chicken Florentine soup was good"}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere and an above average beer selection. Salad seemed to be made fresh, wings were okay, but if you are looking for a wildly addictive appetizer...try the corndog shrimp, if it sounds good to you (and maybe even if not) just do it, seriously!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out when I was told Penguins was closed and this was the next best thing. Long story short, I've had better.  I wanted to get the whole experience in one order so I ordered chicken tenders, fries, fried pickles, and a burger.   Chicken was NOT seasoned well at all. They were little balls of some sort. The fries were ok. I rather have McDonalds. Fried pickels=delish. Burger=ok.  Have not been back since then, nor do I plan on going. Especially since I found out Penguin is open!  The decor and ambiance was nice, and the hostess was cool too. The food just wasn't up to par for me."}
{"text":"White trash burger is amazing!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. A little confused by they service. The food was good. My boyfriend and I got a burger and corn dog, fries, onion rings and my favorite the crab puppies!   The service was a little confusing, there were 5 people helping us, coming by the table every 30 seconds to check on us. Which is good for customer service but at some points we felt like we couldn't eat. There was one other couple in the place when we got there and shortly after another couple arrived. They waited at the front, and was ignored by the passing staff. At one point they just grabbed menus and sat themselves.   Over all the food was great, but the service was a little off. Would be much better if there was one server to one table. Too many people kept us from eating."}
{"text":"I like that it's cheap. I like that the food names are kind of cute in a hardcore rock way. I don't generally love the food, but what do you want--it's fun, and it's cheap. A good place to meet up with people and not spend a ton on the tab. Only downside is that now the place is packed--all the time. Westside is still coming around, and right now they've pretty much cornered the market. As the area continues growing, I think the crowds will even out."}
{"text":"I love this \"dive\" restaurant! Most everything is fried and southern and not the healthiest, but it's amazing! Highly recommend the fried bologne sandwich and fried squash! Their crab puppies are pretty unique and love eating a few of those. The drink menu is diverse and offers quite a few fun drinks. It's a small restaurant, so wait times can be long, but all of the waiters/waitresses work as a team, so service is pretty quick once you're seated!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Hip atmosphere.. It's definitely laid back. Parking can be a challenge at times."}
{"text":"Weird and tasty. That's the best way I know to describe Pinky's menu. Burgers with weird toppings, weird appetizers, weird names... but all quite tasty. And it's not just piles of greasy mashed together - there's some care put into the construction of the food. You actually get to appreciate the weirdness.   Parking can be annoyingly tricky, so just aim straight for the lot across Freedom and walk over.   My favorite meal here? The White Trash Burger, a side of Fried Pickles and a local draft brew. The menu is well priced, leaving you with some extra cash monies for the beer selection."}
{"text":"Slightly pricey for the money.  Sides extra.  Too early for a full review.  Willing to return for another try"}
{"text":"This quaint restaurant at the corner of Morehead and Freedom Drive appears to be a dive bar that caters to the \"non dive bar\" crowd.  Littered with bumper stickers on the ice cooler, kitchen door, and beverage cooler is home to an energy-filled staff dressed in Pinky's t-shirts but showing off their individual style south of the t-shirt.  The restaurant has posters and signs from local events covering every open space of wall real estate and the wooden furniture proves to be an inviting touch.  In here you can yell, laugh, and order filling portions of bar food designed to intrigue you enough so that you read every description on the menu (i.e White Trash burger, Pterodactyl burger, Camp Green House Salad).   Because I love seafood, I went with the Corn Dog Shrimp.  Although I usually don't have any expectations, I was surprised when my meal choice did not work out.  As I waited for my order to come to the table, I observed many plates of food passing me on middle school plastic cafeteria trays (another cool and funky style of Pinky's).  The burgers were huge, smelled sinful, and the hot dogs, corn dogs, soups, and salads I saw made me want to eat everything that passed me.    I munched down on my Shrimp Corn Dogs and realized the combination was a bad mix. The sweet corn dog batter wrapped around shrimp did not work.  I did not know if the honey mustard worked best or the tarter sauce, so I used both.  I ended up removing the bread from the shrimp and eating them separately with the condiments (shrimp and tater sauce, bread and honey mustard).  Needless to say, it left a harsh after taste in my mouth and the potato salad was not my friend.  It has a gritty look to it and an herbal taste.  If you are looking for something with crunch (red onions or celery) and herbs, try the potato salad.    Will I eat here again?  Yes, but I have to try their burgers and leave the cute, unconventional food parings listed on the menu to the more daring crowd.   BTW:  I will sit outside next time."}
{"text":"If I still had young kids wanting me to take them to McDonald's I probably would appreciate this Penguin-wannabe as an alternative.  But, I don't, and I don't.  The original Penguin fit its setting.  It was a rundown dive in a rundown neighborhood with a good vibe and good \"low brow\" food.  The effort to re-create this in an upscale Huntersville shopping center seems like something in a theme park.  It lacks any authenticity.  I was there on a Monday night, and it was full of families with young kids.  The bar has only three beers on tap.  I ordered a burger, a \"Maddy Patty Melt.\"  I cannot remember when I last saw a place that sold burgers without fries or some other side, and that is okay, but might the waitress not have tried a little simple upselling, like, would you like fries with that?  The burger comes out wrapped in paper, and that is the last I saw of my waitress.  The burger is supposed to be on Texas Toast, and I suppose that allows them to call whatever they want Texas Toast, but it sure looked and tasted like ordinary white bread to me.  To pay and end my meal I had to flag down the hostess/cashier.  The place, again, was full, and perhaps for families with young children, it is a good choice.  There are better burgers at the Five Guys in the same shopping center, and several other restaurants there better than this one."}
{"text":"First of all the location is awesome . You have to actually take your time and see all the artwork posted around the building . You can even buy some artwork ! Awesome ! Now to the good stuff , my burger called the JIVE TURKEY . It was a really well seasoned and juicy turkey patty  . I deff had to put the works called everything . Which included lettuce , tomato , pickles and onions . They don't have combination plates so your sides are sold separate . I had waffle fries and I bought a side of house made tartar sauce . I enjoyed the tartar sauce , definitely a score . Service was great , not to mention he was cute .  The menu was executed well with quirky funky names ."}
{"text":"Tried one of their burgers with the chili and it was amazing! It was happy hour so house margaritas were $3 . Went with a friend and got 4 drinks and appetizer and two burgers for 30! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Service was great, all of the staff assists you.  A community oriented service style.  Food is reasonably priced.  They have some unique items for those who like different( peanut butter on a burger).  Nothing fancy, plastic plates, kid friendly.  They have good mixed drinks.  I gave it a try, not sure if it's enough to bring me back though."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner! Fast service and very reasonable prices. I ordered the Uptown Tuna Melt with a side of Southern Slaw and it was delicious. Lunch crowd was medium and the place provides a different atmosphere than your typical chain restaurant. Friendly and affordable - definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The white trash burger is mouth wateringly delicious. One of my favorite burgers anywhere. Tasty with waffle fries. Great, friendly service."}
{"text":"The Penguin reincarnated....and possibly even better. Yummy turkey burgers and awesome falafel! And super cheap. Kinda small so it can get crowded quick. But well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Kinda Fried Turkey sandwich is amazing! Enough said.  In a city where you can find pimento cheese everywhere, theirs stands out because they melt it over super yummy waffle fries. Oh, and brown the top for texture and extra flavor.  Pickles were just OK and super greasy, so just go with the pimento cheese fries instead."}
{"text":"cough cough... too... much...oil.  When I read reviews that this place had good fried pickles and a great beer selection, I had to check it out.  I got the white trash burger and fried pickles.  I was not impressed with the food.  The fry batter was kind of wet and oily.  The beer selection wasn't too impressive.  I went with a local, 4 four friends queen city red (terrible).  However, our waiters and waitresses (all eight of them) were friendly."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. The place was almost as mismatched and out of place as Guy Fieri's look, I think the burgers even had frosted tips."}
{"text":"Wow, this place really caught me offguard. I didn't know what I was getting into when I first arrived. The food is simply delicious. The service is phenomenal and the atmosphere is casual and hip with a great variety of music. I will definitely go back again and again. The prices are great and the value for what you get in the caliber of the meal is off the charts. I was really impressed by the variety and the options on the menu, healthy nutritious and delicious. Fun and quirkynames for the extensive list of cocktails. A great variety of dipping sauces that come with a lot of their dishes and options for you no matter what type of diet you may or may not be on. The parking lot in front of pinkies is really small and likely to be full but don't panic they have a huge lot available for you to park in just a couple hundred feet down the road and it's free parking!"}
{"text":"I love a good, solid burger, and the Penguin was always at the top of my list for that.   Having said that?   When I come to Pinky's, I am seduced by the Ding Dong Chicken. SO. GOOD.   For starters - though I realise it's practically sacrilege to say so - I prefer the pimento chili fries over the fried pickles (too salty).   The tahini salad is promising, but the dressing still needs some zip.   After six visits, I feel pretty solid in giving it a four - good, all-around place, with a few misses (crab puppies have been hit or miss for me)."}
{"text":"A Charlotte gem...  Cant believe it took me so long to eat here a few weeks ago !  Cant wait to go back...  Order the hush puppies too !!"}
{"text":"These folks sell really bad stuff. The sort of \"bad stuff\" that makes any plan of sticking to your diet a distant memory.  Burgers, popcorn chicken and fish tacos. Heaven on a plate.  Oh yes, the staff are great and can even help out with directions when the roads are congested!"}
{"text":"One my favorite places to grub down! From the Pimpin Fries to the burgers, this place nails it every time!! Cannot go wrong with this one!!"}
{"text":"I went to Pinkys tonight to meet a friend. The hostess asked if a small 2 seater would do its all they had. I said sure but I was relieved to see a couple leaving a 4 seater beside me. I asked a waitress coming to wipe off the table if I could move. She said yes but she had to wipe the table off. Not even a second went by when the table on the other side asked for the table. She told me they were getting it because they had more people coming. I replied but I asked first. I guess Pinkys doesn't treat their customers by what's right but by size of crowd and the waitstaff doesn't have to honor their word. I will be eating at places where all customers are valuable from now on."}
{"text":"A. The service is ALWAYS  amazing, even if the place is packed  B. The natureboy (their veggie burger) is an awesome version of a bean burger, and you can get it any way you want it...which is a veg dream. No more boring black bean burgers or frozen veggie patties.  C. HELLO fountain Cheerwine.  I'm a pretty picky vegetarian, with a basket of food allergies, and i've never been disappointed with anything I have tried so far!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Skrimpz appetizer with tartar sauce and waffle fries. The shrimp were very nicely fried (not so much that the fried portion became a separate component), the fries were as expected (very good but not out of the ordinary), and the tartar sauce was AWESOME. The flavor was more substantial than than others, and still thick but not chunky. So delicious. Very good!!"}
{"text":"This review is for huntersville location.   My husband and I are trying to like this place. We have been twice now but I don't think we will go again. So here are the pros:  Nice atmosphere Friendly and accommodating staff Some of the food was good. Fish tacos were good. My husbands burger was over cooked and they didn't ask how he wanted it cooked. He had a good beer.  Cons: We never know who our waiter/waitress is. We have so many people who wait on our table.   The tiny little baskets that the food arrives in. I hate them. They give you absolutely no room to grub. The food a lot of the time is messy. My husbands sandwich was falling apart and there was no room in the paper basket to catch all the filling. I got fish tacos and had to ask for an additional basket to eat out of.   Plastic silverware. I can't believe it. I need a sturdy knife to cut my toddlers corn dog up and they bring me a plastic knife. Not even a well made plastic knife. And she has a little paper basket big enough to hold only a single corn dog. I asked for an additional plate to put her cut up corn dog on and they bring me a styrofoam mini plate that could fall to the floor if you blow on it.   Last time I went I got a salad. They delivered it to me and asked if there was anything else I needed it. I asked for salad dressing and a fork! Geez"}
{"text":"This is my Cheers. It's one of the few (good) places near work so I am here a lot. As such, I've had about everything on the menu and even sampled some of their innovative daily specials. There is something for everyone here. When you want to be good, they've got salads and black bean burgers. When you want to be bad, they've got burgers and fries. And the best fried pickles in town. It's no coincidence that my favorite burger has fried pickles on it, the white trash (turkey) burger: fried pickles, provolone cheese, and secret sauce. Paired with a side of sweet potato fries or waffle fries and washed down with a beer, it makes for a great lunch."}
{"text":"Today was the 2nd time we ate here. First time we had the Chili.....nothing exciting. We chose this place because it was close to Mom's. The 2nd time we decided to venture in with Mom was because we know she is limited to what she can eat and likes bland food. Pinky's lived up to the expectation once again. This place gets 2 stars because the wait staff is good."}
{"text":"I had heard rave reviews about Pinky's (most from the Morehead location). I was near Huntersville and stopped in with family. The server was great. We got a pitcher of House Margaritas. It was a different taste, but good. More sour than I thought it would be. Appetizers were buy one get one, so we got the Crab Puppies and the Waffle Fries with Pimento cheese. The fries were about room temperature, so the cheese got grainy. The Crab Puppies were amazing. I would definitely recommend those!   I had the Tilapia Tacos. They were fried so they had that deep fry taste, but I was impressed. The rest of my family thought their food was so-so. My aunt had the Popcorn Shrimp Salad and wasn't a fan. Overall it was an ok experience. I would rather try the original location."}
{"text":"Pinky's is a great neighborhood burger joint. The staff is great especially Sean. If your around the westside check it out it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Crazy food on the menu here, things that sound strange but indeed  are quite tasty. If you like a food coma, this place is it! They have a huge selection of beer too! The one in Charlotte is great after an airport run when people come in town to visit."}
{"text":"Why everyone doesn't give this place 5 stars is beyond me. I LOVE this place. Every time I have been to visit my dad in Charlotte, I think we have come here. You can get pimiento cheese on their burgers AND on their hot dogs. Who doesn't love that? They also have a hand dipped corn dog that is probably the best corn dog I have ever tried. Sides are on point and they have a nice beer selection to go along with it. If you like good food then this is your place!"}
{"text":"Pinky's is a very interesting place with a very diverse menu. There is plenty of neat art/graphic things too look at. They even have KISS pinball! All around there is a very comfortable dinner atmosphere.  My favorite thing about Pinky's is there drink menu. They have a good verity of beer and liquor. Not to mention, so far, they make the best Manhattan in town and it's relatively cheap. They all kinds of different and good drinks, along with specials every night of the week.  The food is good quality for a dinner. They even have a vegetarian menu with vegan items listed, which is always appreciated by me. My favorite item so far is the tahini salad, mostly because of the falafels, they are very good though a little greasy, but isn't that what dinner food is about?"}
{"text":"4 for the food, but I'm knocking off a star for our encounter with the SURLIEST hostess ever. We had a tables worth of people there already and were more than happy to sit down and start ordering drinks and snacks while waiting for the rest of our party to show since we were expecting to be spread out through a bunch of tables anyways but apparently that's totally not cool. And after everybody showed up and there were tables free where they could've fit all of us she separated us anyways. I don't even know what was going on there.  Now anyways, onwards to the food and drinks. I was very appreciative that they had delicious, delicious Blenheim available. The crab puppies were amazing, and I had to stop myself from eating more than was fair from my foursome's shared appetizer order. For my main I chose the corndog shrimp and they were made with huge and delicious shrimp, although I'm still not entirely convinced that slightly sweet corndog batter goes well with shrimp. Waffle fries and southern slaw were good. So overall I'd probably go again if I could make sure I'd never encounter that hostess again."}
{"text":"Best food and atmosphere in the area. The White Trash burger is a must, and the specials they have are almost always a must try. The fried pickles are done perfectly.  Be warned, the place is small and the parking is even smaller, but worth the effort and wait!"}
{"text":"It's pretty much what you expect. Most things are fried, the food is pretty good, the service is good. My favorite thing on the menu are the cheese fries. It's small, so it gets packed pretty quickly, but I think they are adding on a patio area for more seating."}
{"text":"The best word to describe Pinky's is eclectic....from the patrons, to the staff, to the food, to the music, to the decor, the place is just one big melting pot of awesome.  I'm pretty sure that I was waited on by every server working tonight, and each one was efficient and friendly.  The service was awesome.  My fitbit exploded as I finished my meal, since I picked probably the least healthy (but most delicious) options.  I had what was supposed to be a bakers dozen crab fritters, but there were 15 total.  I ate every one.  The crab was sweet, and the fritters a perfect golden color.  The tartar sauce they came with for dunking was more than mayo and relish...it had a vinegary bite that was an awesome compliment to the sweet.  Then I had ginormous corn bread shrimp.  The batter was thick, but not greasy.  Again, the bite of some cocktail sauce perfectly offset the sweet of the corn batter.  I don't like fries, and usually skip them, but the waffle fries that came with the shrimp were crispy, and had the right amount of salt.  The only reason I didn't eat them all was because I was stuffed.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"There was a wait of about 10-15 minutes to be seated which is what we expected anyways (it was around 7:30). Once seated we were sitting almost on top of the people to the left and right of us. The burger was ok, the fried pickles were also ok, but the tilapia fish tacos were very good! They also have a good non-alcoholic menu option for customers! Would go back for the tacos when visiting again."}
{"text":"Thank you Pinkys for offering veggie options.  The veggie corn dogs and hot dogs (with veggie chili) are my favorites.  I just try not to fill up on the hushpups and other apps that are also delicious."}
{"text":"Moved from Asheville when I was 15 to the westside of Charlotte. Very familiar with the auto shop and the VW on the roof.  34 years ago I moved to the next county over. That and the fact that I worked in food service was not a good incentive to go out of my way to dine. I am retired now and looking forward to trying all these good eats I have heard about over the years. Top of my list was Pinkey's which is located in the old auto shop and the VW is still on the roof.     I was not disappointed. My shrimp was lightly breaded and I loved, loved, loved the tartar sauce. The onions rings were like the beer battered ones I make at home, thin and lightly breaded. The chili on the waffle fries was like what my Dad made, just all meat good chili. A friend ordered the corn dog shrimp which he gobbled up. What I am telling you is everything tasted like someone cared.   Service was excellent. Stephanie the manager of the day was so friendly and very attentive. Everyone took the time to be gracious. Now that being said, this was on a Monday evening at 6:00.  I know things will get crazy when they are slammed. But the food and the atmosphere are worth it. And remember that it takes time to make food handmade. Don't be in a hurry for good food someone cared about before it got to you.  Food portions are huge. Three of us shared the Pimp'n Fries. And the eclectic mix of customers is amazing.  You could have a doctor at one table and a truck driver at the next. One thing they have in common. They know where the good food is."}
{"text":"Just moved here and this place is amazing  the food is so good and the people working their are super nice. Thank you"}
{"text":"Great drink options and specials. Service was great. Lots of food options to choose from."}
{"text":"Meh. A mediocre rating for a mediocre experience.   The food was OK - not great nor special.  The Shrimp Dogs (corn dog breaded shrimp) were uneventful, mostly breaded, and non seasoned below market shrimp.   Popcorn Chicken weren't crispy at all, basically just small grilled balls of small chicken pieces. It also costs an extra .75 to toss it in buffalo sauce that tasted like it came straight from a bottle of Frank's Red Hot (okayyyy make your money I guess).   Only plus side were the waffle fries. Not too crispy, not soggy, lightly salted.   Food presentation is paper plates, boats, and napkins which is fine being its kind of a divey place with cooky but fun decorations- and that fits the theme they're trying to achieve.   The service itself was nice, friendly, and prompt. Can't complain there.   I dunno for $30 with tip included, this place was over priced for the quality they serve. I probably won't be back and will let this one disappear into the back of my head, along with the other mediocre places to eat in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Very casual cool eclectic vibe. Great selection on the menu and all of it got 5 stars from our group of five. I had the white trash burger and was really impressed! All of their offerings are slightly unique with great flavors. This place is a must and then a must go back!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service from our waitress Jacy was amazing and extremely nice! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Parking a little bit of a problem, but the Mammoth burger and pimento cheese fries were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Loooooove the menu! Who'da thunk crunchy peanut butter would work on a burger!?"}
{"text":"lara's review!  my dad is in town this week, and we were able to go out for lunch together one day.  i told him about a new place called pinky's that i recently heard about.  it's totally up his alley (and mine) because we both love burger dives.  located at the corner of freedom and morehead, it's not in the best part of town, so i probably wouldn't go there after dark, but i felt totally fine going there for lunch.  we saw all sorts of characters - business people out for lunch, moms and their kids, and lots of funky tattooed folks who work there.  i love places that attract an eclectic bunch, so to me, this was a sign that the food would be good, and was it ever.  my dad got the ding dong style burger, and i got the maddy patty melt.  we shared a basket of fried pickles.  the ding dong style burger was crazy but delicious, according to my dad.  it's a burger with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce.  he loved the flavor explosion, and said he would order it again.  my maddy patty melt was equally good.  it's a five ounce burger with grilled onions, 1000 island dressing, swiss and american cheese hot pressed between two slices of texas toast.  it almost tasted like a burger covered in pimento cheese, with a little bit of a kick.  i would definitely order it again . . . although, i have to admit, the white trash burger caught my eye, and i don't think i'll be able to pass it up next time.  it's a five ounce burger with provolone, fried pickles, onion rings and spicy ranch sauce.  how good does that sound?  our basket of fried pickles was the best i've ever had.  they were thinly sliced and lightly fried (is that an oxymoron?), and the ranch dipping sauce was perfect - not too thick, so it didn't overwhelm the flavor of the pickles, but complimented them perfectly.  the portions were not huge, which usually annoys me, but, in this case, the portion was perfect for a lunchtime burger.  i didn't leave feeling stuffed, and i was pleasantly full.  our burgers were between $4-$5 each, and the pickles were about $4, so it's a total \"cheap eats\" place.  the service was great even though the place was packed - friendly, fast, and attentive.  i can't wait to go back.  i might have to convince my family to join me there this weekend because i can't stop thinking about that white trash burger.  it's calling my name."}
{"text":"I dont know that I can say much more than others have already said. My friend and I, based on recommendations from other yelpers, got the pimento fries with bacon. Excellent!! We were complete fatties that day. I got the White Trash burger and a side of potato salad while my friend got the green chile pork with a side of fried zucchini.  My burger was absolutely delicious and was not too huge that I could not fit it in my mouth. Also, I am generally pretty picky about my potato salad, but this was red potato salad with a slight kick to it. It had celery in it as well as another green herb of some sort. It tasted great, i took some home for later! My friend also very much enjoyed her sandwich - and who doesnt like fried zucchini - dipped in ranch they were even better?! I had asked our waiter, which btw the waitstaff was also great but more about that later, which was the most popular item. He then said that fried pickles were first, and the white trash burger was second. Well, lucky for me - fried pickles come on the white trash burger. Knocked out two birds with one stone! Saturday was also $4 any Absolute drink. I got a Madras which turned out to be really strong for only $4.  What i really liked about this place, was that all of the waiters helped eachother out. We didnt just have one waiter, we had 3. We werent harassed every two minutes but we also were not forgotten about. The service was excellent. The restaurant is kind of on the brim of a not so good area - but i would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"You may or may not get what you go for here.  If challenging parking is not your thing, move on.  I've honestly passed them by before because there was no where to park. Place up the street a little easier.  Thought I might navigate around peak times but still a 30 min wait.  Pass. Finally get there, get seated, get started.  The décor is busy and keeps your eyes wandering. The drink menu suggests it's a cool place to have a cocktail.  Shared server service not really blown away by this idea.  Felt uncertain whom to communicate, odd down here in the south.  Food all seemed interesting.  I'm swayed ( by the group) to try fried pickles again.  Bad idea.  Salt salt and more salt. Crisp but salty.  Generous portion but salty.  Wasabi dipping sauce helped a lot.  I had the Paddy Melt, well seasoned but not memorable.  I tried the hush puppy shrimp, interesting but I thought a little too much soft texture.  Oh wait, send in that wasabi sauce again.  Better.  I think you can bounce around the menu and find something that flips your hair back but even so, it's a great hangout spot.  Great place to sit, in or out and pass the time.  I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for lunch and had great expectations after reading all these awesome reviews. Honestly, I was a little disappointed. We ordered crab pups and fried pickles and liked it. Crab pups were a bit chewy, but the tartar sauce was amazing. The fried pickles were light and out of this world and the wasabi ranch that comes with it was great.   I ordered the green chili pork and my wife ordered the stray dog (veggie dog). Neither of us were impressed with our choices. At first bite the pork  and pineapple seemed to go well, but I was struggling to finish it. And my wife said she'd had better veggie dogs before, but she really liked the veggie chili on the dog. They seem to have a decent beer menu and some good craft brews (I had the Red Oak Amber Ale). Their cocktail list was exhaustive and I really enjoyed the $5 Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and thought hey let me give it a whirl will take the risk Man if honey boo-boo owned a restaurant it would be this place and the food it's okay not worth the calories   Also the other reviewers were right - you'll definitely have diarrhea when you get home."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the beer selection...the natureboy was delicious! The building is adorable with a old vw bettle on top! The servers are all nice,and we have enjoyed this place on datenight with good friends!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant! Ever since the Penguin closed a while back and Pinkys opened in its place I've always held this place close to my heart. The atmosphere is amazing, I love the music, the feel of the joint, the service is always spot on, and of course the food is THE BEST!!!  Their burgers, bacon pimento cheese fries, fried pickles, sweet potato fries, hell everything they have is perfect. Especially accompanied by a tall boy :P I recommend this place to everyone! It has heart and soul in every bite, definitely the place to be while hanging out with friends drinkin a cold beer an eating amazing food. I miss eating here so much, I can't wait to come here again and again when I move back in a few months!"}
{"text":"Solid burger selection with many topping choices including--get this--chunky peanut butter. Don't knock it til you give it a try. Servers are always upbeat and quick with a recommendation. And I have to agree with several others that the fried pickles are a must. Don't even think about it--just order them when you sit down.  Finally, I've always found their drink specials a great deal. Be sure to check out the handwritten specials menu posted behind the bar for the latest."}
{"text":"Friends, let's be completely honest about the ding dong chicken.  It was sub par to say the least!   Before even getting to the ultimate fail of the peanut butter, the chicken \"pattie\" and cafeteria-like white bun really deflated any chance of this being worth it's cost.  Both were clearly mass produced, frozen, thawed, warmed and slopped on a plate after being cooked in an admittedly decent array of spices.  The only reason I ordered this particular sando was to partake on a thai like peanut/spice journey and to take my first bite and arrive with a thick schtick of crunchy Jif on the roof of my mouth couldn't have pissed me off more.  This sandwich seriously had potential, but it's like someone gave up along the way and settled for \"this will do\". That being said, I'm willing to give the joint another shot for two reasons: 1.  The white bean hummus was tasty. 2.  They were giving away free beer in lieu of not having secured their ABC permit. I sincerely hope this place makes it b/c it's great for the neighborhood, but I feel there are some menu offerings that need to step it up a notch."}
{"text":"Great food - Even better price for what you get... The burgers are some of the best in the city  + the wings and blu cheese are cooked perfect & flavor fantastic - Go!!!"}
{"text":"Pinky's is the best! We love the Thursday night draft specials! The staff is so friendly and so are the other customers! Somehow, they've made an amazing neighborhood hang-out in a strip mall in the burbs. We LOVE Pinky's! Order the pimento cheese fries!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, yummy margaritas, funky atmosphere and friendly staff.  So happy this came highly recommend for our Charlotte trip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars here and I cannot think of one bad thing to say about this place! From the food to the beers to the staff nothing bad about this place."}
{"text":"Honestly there is nothing not to like.  First time here.  I ordered the white trash burger.  It was delicious.  Corn bread popcorn shrimp was also a winner."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Sunday. Was quite crowded but my friend and I were able to get a small table pretty quickly. Ordered the white trash burger (5.95; comes with fried onions and fried pickles) with a side of waffle fries (2.50 iirc). Meal took a bit longer to come out but that's totally understandable given the busyness of the time. Food was fantastic. Service was subpar but nothing crazy or anything. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I definitely appreciate you reaching out regarding the review I left. Most owners don't even take the time or are very defensive. We would love the chance to visit your establishment again and I would absolutely welcome any opportunity to be able to write a positive review!! Thank you Andy!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this.  Was familiar with the morehead location.  Food was average.  Good drink menu.  Our only gripe was the service.  I felt like the staff was trained to be quirkily rude and appear to not know the menus.  To an earlier posts comment...maybe downtown, but if pinkys wants to make it in the suburbs, they're going to have to balance the quirkiness with a desire to better serve the unsuspecting guest.  At least, explain that the service is part of the concept.  While I want to believe this,  the fact that one of our 4 servers (\"team service\") didnt know what the drink was that we ordered (from the drink menu) and the other when i asked what pinkys was famous for, she said \"our morehead location\".  So prob just a lack of training.  I would also recommend a more concerted effort to bring in the bar crowd.  One 30 inch tv over the bar was pretty lame.  Pinkys appears to be suffering from an identity crisis in their sophomore endeavor.  I'll give it one more chance in a couple months.  Good drinks though!  (Dark and stormies!)"}
{"text":"The first few times my family ate here it was pretty good. Better than average bar type food and good service. However, something seems to have changed in the past 6 months. The last few times we've been there, the quality of the food has gotten steadily worse. Before our last visit, my wife and I decided we wouldn't eat there anymore because everything was soaked in grease. My wife's fried fish was sitting in a pool of oil from the fryer as were the onion rings she ordered.  Our daughter came to visit from NY and wanted to eat at Pinky's so we reluctantly agreed to eat there again. Everything, I repeat, everything was soaked in grease. We could only stomach about half of our food. Is it too much trouble to let the fries, fried squash, and onion rings drain for a few seconds before serving them? We will never return again! There is a high quality burger joint in the same complex as well as a good sub shop so we will be spending our money at those places instead of Pinky's."}
{"text":"Best turkey burger in town!! Full bar, great beer selection, and very casual.  Consistently good service and food.  Don't leave without getting a homemade dessert! There is usually a wait, but the tables turn fairly quickly."}
{"text":"It wasn't  for my family.  They play very loud metal music, when asked to turn it down the waitress said the manager wont do it, but she would ask for us anyway.  They did turn down the music for us - I am glad they obliged.  NO KID'S MENU, so if you have a small child under 3 yrs., you may want to bring your own food.  The food we ordered a Nate veggie burger, corn dog and fish tacos.  All the meals contained a lot of fried battered ingredients (even the veggie burger)  so the meal was greasy and we did not find the tiny paper serving baskets and plastic dinnerware very helpful when trying to eat.  The dining room decor  is eclectic and fun. I am happy Huntersville is getting more dining choices, maybe this place is for the younger more hip crowd."}
{"text":"This eclectic dive-bar is one of my favorite places in the city. I have perfected my order over the years and always order the same thing: falafel in tacos, ding dong style with a side of fried squash and ranch. You should try it, in fact - they should name it after me. Be prepared that it is usually loud in the restaurant, but there are things all over the walls and plenty to look at while waiting for your food. You also don't have a set \"server\" they all kind of work every table - meaning you can grab any tattoo'ed or pierced person and ask for a beer. They have some awesome drink specials and a good variety of drinks/beer. I usually take my out of town friends here if they ever visit Charlotte for the first time, it never disappoints. Also.. the banana pudding.. YES."}
{"text":"Kitschy atmosphere with eclectic menu and great drinks. We had corn dog shrimp, maddy paddy melt, nature boy burger with sweet potato chips and wasabi ranch. Everything was wonderful the shrimp were exactly what you would expect, the paddy melt was juicy and the nature boy loaded with flavor. We topped of that awesome meal with possibly the best banana pudding we have ever had, a heaping bowl of summer time bliss with pudding infused vanilla wafers, delicious.  The wait staff rocked it, always there but never stalking.  Thanks for the experience, if I am ever back in Charlotte I know where I will be eating."}
{"text":"Wow! Why have we waited so long to check this place out??? Everything was delicious. We had the fried pickles, cheese fries, fish sand, chicken sandwich and chicken popper salad. We all loved our meals, the ranch dressing tastes homemade. Service was excellent also. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We found this through an app as it appeared on Diners, Drive in's and Dives. The atmosphere was loud but fun. The server work as a team so you get help from everyone. We ordered chili fries, chicken tacos and a patty melt. The patty melt was dry but the other food was delicious. I'd go back and would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Really nice place to go. I had the shrimp tacos and they were really good!! Great customer service as well. Food came on time and they are affordable as well. Definitely recommend this place especially for dinner."}
{"text":"The fried pickles are awesome and the thin slices of onion rings are so delicious. The owner is the same guy who came up with the Penguin menu. If you love the Penguin, you will LOVE PINKY'S!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"AH-AMAZING burgers and fries and cheap drink specials. Only downside is it is always SUPER busy with long waits and the parking lot is tiny-especially on weekends. Word of advice-call ahead!"}
{"text":"Native Charlotteans know any place that names a burger after Ric Flair (Woooo!) is going to be good. If getting into a figure four leg lock with The Nature Boy (Woooo!) isn't your top choice of culinary entertainment, consider taking your baby to a bar with the White Trash Burger. Either way, do it right and get any of the burgers \"Ding Dong Style\": topped with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce. Pure taste bud debauchery.  The nods to Charlotte icons continue with the Pterodactyl Burger, an homage to the now razed, but well-loved by Charlotte's underage citizens, alternative music nightclub which stood directly across from Pinky's Westside Grill on Freedom Drive in the late '80s and '90s.  Owners Greg Auten, Andy Cauble and Dave Rhames are former managing chefs at The Penguin, and they've brought the ever popular Greg's Pickles (nee Fried), Hushpuppies and Corn Dogs with them. They also fought to keep the Volkswagen Beetle on top of their building, which was formerly home to Triple \"G\" Automotive, as the remaining sign in the parking lot attests.  Choices from the menu are served up primarily by heavily inked, friendly, but way cooler than you staff. Selections from the jukebox, some of them local bands, accompany the consumption of Pimento Cheese Waffle Fries, daily specials and desserts like Cheerwine Pound Cake and specialty drinks. Framed photos of the Four Horsemen, one of whom is The Nature Boy himself (Woooo!), and NASCAR memorabilia watch over it all, reminding diners to remember their Charlotte roots.  Additional parking for Pinky's is located across the street from the location at 1600 West Morehead Street in Charlotte. (Woooo!)"}
{"text":"You need to be ok with fried food and dairy that's for sure. Great combinations on burgers."}
{"text":"Weird experience! I was excited to try Pinky's after seeing them on triple D. I went with a friend today and the experience was very strange! We were seated at an end booth, which dead-ended against a wall.  In other words, you could not walk past the table, you had to walk down and turn around to go back. After taking our order, our server disappeared. After that, a procession of people who worked there kept walking down to our table, looking at us, and then walking away. Some would stop and take things from the table, but most just looked. They came so often I finally asked one of them what time they closed as I felt they must want us out of there (it was 1:30 in the afternoon, but I thought perhaps they only serve breakfast and lunch). She said they closed at 11:00 p.m. A guy, one of the looky-loo's, asked if we were going to have anything else before I was even done with my burger. When we said no, he brought the check. Definitely felt like we were being rushed out of the place. I don't know why. There wasn't a wait and there were plenty of empty tables. The burger was o.k. I had the White Trash Burger. The fried pickles and onions rings on top were cold. The burger itself was juicy and tasty. Overall, it was just o.k. The constant stream of people walking down to our table was uncomfortable and ruined our lunch."}
{"text":"Great good, very good service. We frequent often, always good. Great service, good beer specials a few nights a week. Don't go often, but when we do it's always good"}
{"text":"The white trash burger was off the hook. First rate service and atmosphere with plenty of parking around the corner."}
{"text":"A week ago today I ventured into Pinky's with a co-worker and 2 of our customers for lunch. The place was packed! Instead of waiting for a table we were told the bar area is first come first serve. We glanced over and saw they had room for all of us to sit. We walked over to the bar and before we sat down, a female employee literally KICKED one of the bar chairs towards my co-worker and shouted at us you can SIT DOWN! she also threw her arms up like a umpire does in baseball when someone is safe. I was in shock she not only Yelled but Kicked a chair at us!  I was so embarrassed my customers had to witness this. What also makes me upset the fact I called in later that day around 7pm or so to voice my concern abut how Rude and Ugly your employee treated us. I gave my name and number and was told  this would be addressed/ made up to me. Still yet to receive that call.  Heads up if you go during lunch...you might get a chair kicked at you!"}
{"text":"Always excellent. The falafel balls are incredible!"}
{"text":"I hate to compare, but face it, this is supposed to be a bit like The Penguin. Unfortunately, it is the Penguin, minus Plaza Midwood, the history, and the people. Relying on super greasy, fried foods and a full bar, Pinkies is located in West Charlotte, which is frankly kind of a bad place to be considering that all there is in this area of West Charlotte is hamburger joints.  The only reason it gets 2 stars is the fried pickles. Those fried pickles just have a way of making things better. I had the chicken tenders and my mom had a hamburger (I guess I should've been a little more creative, but I thought it would be difficult to mess up chicken tenders...guess not). Her hamburger came with nothing but well...a greasy hamburger in a basket. My chicken tenders were a bit burned, but the fries were great. We had 3 different waitresses checking up on us, but getting the check took a long time. A group came in (we went on a Monday afternoon...a teacher workday) and wanted to be seated, and getting enough tables together took about 10 minutes and space was very crammed. I'd like to think that this was because it was at prime lunchtime, but how in the world do they handle Saturday night crowds, especially when the parking lot has about 6 spots? Guess I'll have to go back someday and see.  Overall, this is no Penguin, so don't go in looking for that. The food was eh, the service was eh, the location is eh, it just wasn't what I hoped it would be. I guess if I were old enough to drink I would've enjoyed it more..."}
{"text":"Love Pinky's. LOVE. This is where we take out of towners to convince them that we're cool.   But seriously. My husband and I have eaten here more times than I can count and have never been disappointed. He loves the White Trash burger. I love their corn dogs and fish tacos. Pinky's can do no wrong."}
{"text":"The best place to get a Vegan sandwich... the black bean burger and falafel is amazing."}
{"text":"Great diner. Fast service.  Atmosphere is cool.  Best in area . . . Just wish late night service was an option."}
{"text":"Amazing wings and awesome service. Waitress was wonderful and attentive, and they went far out of their way to fix my order when something was wrong with it. Cannot recommend this place enough.  Also they have a number of great options if you happen to be eating Keto/Low-carb."}
{"text":"The food was okay.  I left with a full stomach but I wasn't overly satisfied with my meal.  My boyfriend and I ordered a lot of menu items ranging from the hushpuppies with crab meat, Southern 500 hot dog, turkey burger, fries and onion rings.  While the crab puppies were tasty, nothing was memorable.  I probably won't return."}
{"text":"I'm an extremely picky person and I was prepared to be disappointed but everything I ordered was delicious. I ordered the chicken tacos and banana pudding. On the tacos all of the veggies were fresh and the chicken was seasoned well. It also came with flavorful black beans. The banana pudding was really good. Its as close to homemade as you'll get in a restaurant. My coworker ordered the Shrimp puppies and waffle fries. I didn't think I would like the shrimp puppies but they were really good. The house made tarter sauce and cocktail sauce were also really good. The customer service was excellent. I've already told about 10 people to try Pinky's. I would definitely recommend this spot and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Spectacular service and delicious food were waiting for us on a Monday night when everyone else was either only serving cocktails or chain fast food restaurant fare. The specialty burgers and hot dogs along with some perfectly prepared onion rings hit the spot, and the price was just right! I would highly recommend this Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives featured spot on your next trip to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I went three times in one week. It's just really good, casual food. The service is great, people are fun and Pinky's draws up the most diverse demography of people."}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos were fantastic. Great spice and flavor. Unique dish.   Popcorn chicken was moist and the fries were delicious dipped in their honey mustard.   Fun drinks and atmosphere.   Prices were a touch high but with that said, the quality was spot on."}
{"text":"This place definitely has its own unique vibe going on. I think a horror movie of some kind was playing at the bar. The food was mediocre at best. My husband order the pork tacos and liked them pretty well. I order a hamburger and it was very well done. Dry really. My margarita was also pretty bitter. I think the batch of limes was a little off because the wedge on my glass tasted pretty unusual. We both agreed the hush puppies were amazing though. All in all I would say this place is okay depending on what you order. It isn't all great."}
{"text":"Wow.  First time eating at a DDD restaurant and holy cow is it impressive.  Crab chowder was outstanding and packed with crab, Korean tacos were fantastic, and even the fried pickles were great.  The parking is a bit farther than I'd prefer and the music a little louder than I'm used to, but when the food is this good it just doesn't matter.  Will definitely come back here when we visit again!"}
{"text":"This was actually my third attempt to eat here. The last few times I came in a group, and we left because we didn't feel like waiting for a table where we could all sit together.  I came with a pretty good group from work, and as before we had to wait about 15 minutes to get a table. We ended up getting split into two groups, but whatever. We were sat at a table outside, which was perfect since it was a nice day.  Disclaimer: since I am apparently the only person in Charlotte who never hung out at the Penguin, across from Thomas Street Tavern, I went in without any baggage of nostalgia for the old days.   Once seated, service was prompt. Most of our table started by ordering beer. I have very specific taste in beer, and am not particularly drawn to craft brews, so I didn't really find anything for me. Ended up going with a coke. It was quite refreshing. I noticed that everything seemed fairly cheap. I ordered the \"white trash burger\" based on a recommendation from one of my friends. This was when I realized why the food seemed cheap: no sides are included. I took this as a sign and decided to skip the side today.  The food arrived fairly quickly, I assumed. I didn't really pay attention, really, but it got there before I got annoyed, so it couldn't have been long. Looking at the burger I was relieved I didn't go with a side. It was pretty greasy. Soggy greasy, to be perfectly honest. Also, I thought the bun looked a little sad. Pretty much looked like a cheapo supermarket hamburger bun. It did turn out to taste pretty good, if not a bit undistinguished. I think all the ingredients kind of blended together, so nothing really stood out. It was generally good but not particularly good.   I am sure I'll be back to Pinky's because it's close to work and has decent food. I'm not sure I would personally go out of my way to go there otherwise."}
{"text":"An informal place to get something to eat. Great view of the Charlotte skyline. A lot of options, but I was never too impressed with the food here."}
{"text":"Basically had everything on the menu and haven't had one thing I didn't enjoy.  The crab puppies are the best twist on the original hush puppies.  Good vibes all the way around."}
{"text":"Do you like food dripping in grease? Cool atmosphere? Limited parking? and a pretty good bar setup?  Well come on down to Pinky's!  I have tried some of this cities craziest fried foods...that being said, I know if something has been cooked properly. Would you eat a steak that was a chard nugget of flesh? Well of course not! You would ask for your money back.  I was with a group of about 9 people. Each one ordered a different type of fried item from the menu. So it is fair to say we sampled everything available.  I'm not sure who was in the kitchen that day, but I'm sure they had to have never seen a how to cook anything in oil.  At the bottom of each of our baskets there was a pool of burned old oil. Literally a pool! Not just a couple drips, but tablespoons of it.  Each item had a funky taste due to the use of the old oil.  One of the most basic things a greasy spoon style establishment should have on hand is fresh cooking oil. If you can't get that right, who is to say the tap lines for the beer aren't cleaned properly?  Save your money here and head back to The Penguin or The Diamond."}
{"text":"Well not impressed,  probably should be a 2 but new location so I'm being kind.  First off ,NO KIDS MENU?  That might be OK at your Moorehead location but this is Huntersville AKA suburbia.  Was seated right away but wasn't greeted for 10 minutes.  I had a patty melt and onion rings,  they should call them onion straws because all I got was a bunch of 1\" pieces of onions(horrible and greasy).  My patty melt was OK but it was served on regular white bread and not Texas toast like it should have been.  The kids pieced together a a meal by ordering an adult entree and getting an extra side.  They were not blown away.  My wife had a falafel salad and said it was very good she just wished it didn't come in a cardboard basket.  Gets a little soggy with dressing.  We waited over 10 minutes to get our check and finally got it by flagging down another server.   This place is still pretty new so I will wait 30 days and give it another shot.  If its the same I would take it off our list as a viable option.  Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Great food, love the pimp n fries however they cook burgers well done and won't accommodate medium so I find the meat a little drying.  Other than that, everything is very tasty"}
{"text":"If you like to jam out  to cool music and explore your adventurous side or let your hair down and be yourself - try Pinky's.  The menu is impressively more than just burgers and fries.  The food has a real flair and so does the staff working there.  Take a walk on your wild side and check it out  The only bad thing is there is limited parking and sometimes you have to park across the street."}
{"text":"Their burgers will be the end of me. They taste as delicious as they look. They're pretty reasonably priced for the most part. The staff however tries to hurry you along when your trying to make up your mind. I understand they're busy but still. I haven't gotten the chance to try too many other things yet but that will be put on hold for now."}
{"text":"I want to try the \"unicorn tears\" mixed concoction  next time!  It sounded awesome. Friendly staff, they even gave us free hush puppies because they thought our wait was too long but it wasn't. Love the decor, it's hip. There are some Warhol type pics on the wall.  They have a cool Hobbit pinball machine.  They have falafels which I love.  Got them in NY all the time.  I can't figure out if it's a healthy place  to eat or not, seems like a mix which I like"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal!!!  If you like burgers they're great. If you like tater tots they're great. If you like the pimento  cheese on your burger they're great. Top five burger joint in Charlotte North Carolina.  If you're driving through the city this place is worth the stop!!!!!!!  Two minutes off I 77 north and southbound"}
{"text":"Pinky's is our guilty pleasure! We have family in the Huntersville area who first introduced us to the Pinky's in Charlotte. Each visit from Baltimore, we made a trip south to that location. Imagine our delight when Pinky's opened a spot so much closer. The atmosphere is casual, the service attentive and pleasant. The staff always makes us feel welcome. The food is flavorful, fresh and oh so yummy. My favorites include: the hot dogs, the fish tacos, hushpuppies, pimiento cheese, and the Ding Dong-style sandwiches (trust me on that one, ok?). We can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid spot if you're looking for a yummy, greasy burger. The location is a bit of a struggle.  Nobody really relaxes on a patio with a view of traffic. Service is always about the same. No worse than most places. I think they do service by committee, which usually does an okay job."}
{"text":"OUT OF STATE GUESTS BEWARE!!!   The service was horrible. We ran into a situation where one of our group members, my girlfriend, was denied an alcoholic beverage because she has a SC driver's license. The driver's license was valid and she was over the age of 21. The guy who was wrongfully given the title of \"manager\" was completely  rude and unprofessional. The reasons behind the denial were not explained and left us wondering why they denied her alcohol. If the restaurant has the choice to serve alcohol or not to out of state guests, that was not mentioned at all. The chain will never get our service again just because of this event. A different restaurant welcomed our presence and money and we were all able to enjoy our alcohol and food in peace."}
{"text":"Went here for the second time and this time I was sober enough to review it.  It's a good eclectic style diner. It has a hipster feel with a biker twist. Luckily, more of the first. They have a great mixed drink selection and beer selection. I had the Tahini Salad and quite literally bottom less coffee since I had about 4 by the end of the meal.  The meal was quite filling and the falafel was great!! My family also was very impressed with their meals. I am definitely looking forward to the next time I go in. My only complaint about Pinky's and this could be the hippy in me. Yet, I really would rather have my food served on real plates not paper/plastic and some real silverware would be great too.  It's really hard for me to review a place that serves PBR tallboys and has a good vegan//vegetarian selection in the South."}
{"text":"Pinky's is not somewhere you go for healthy eating. I felt like my cholesterol shot up a zillion points after eating here, but after a night of drinking, I needed it.   We ordered the fried pickles and crab hush puppies. The fried pickles were good, but the crab hush puppies were awesome. I do not eat hush puppies often, as I live in the Northeast, so to have such things with the addition of crab was just fantastic.   Wanting to do the South right, I ordered the grilled bologna sandwich \"westside,\" with chili, slaw, mustard, onion, and then some pimento cheese. My cousins ordered the white trash burger (provolone, fried pickles, ranch) and a patty melt, respectively. Both of them had nothing but good things to say about their sandwiches.   I wasn't thrilled with the bologna sandwich, but I ate it anyway. The roll was a little too soft, which made things very sloppy - although that was probably to be part of the experience. The bologna didn't have much taste; I think I was expecting something more like Taylor ham. But it was prepared well, because my Southern cousins approved when I let them try it. As a result, I can't criticize the kitchen; it just wasn't to my personal taste. You win some, you lose some... unless we're talking about weight, which I'm sure I wouldn't lose if I lived near Pinky's.  The service was great and the prices were fair. I would like to come back and try some of their fun mixed drinks one night, as well as the Cheerwine and Sun Drop pound cake."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere drinks and wings! Its has a punk rock kinda feel with friendly servers. Its on the small side but worth a wait if there is one.  Cool little spot!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Charlotte. They get busy, so I would suggest going on an 'off' time, but the prices are very reasonable and the food is always consistent."}
{"text":"Decisions, decisions! You will want to comeback to this grill several times just to try all the tempting items on the menu. My favorite is the White Trash burger which is a 5 oz. burger served with provolone cheese, onion rings, pickles and spicy ranch sauce on it. I'm not a pickle guy so I leave those off and it is still delicious. The Big John is also tasty. Popcorn chicken salad is wonderful. I also recommend the Mammoth burger. I like mine with cheddar cheese and hot sirracha sauce with a side of honey cilantro slaw. The best appetizer is the crab puppies (sweet crab meat folded into golden hush puppies). Each time I walk into Pinky's I tell myself to try a different app but I always get the crab pups. Next time I visit I plan to try the Buffalo shrimp tacos. The young woman seated next to me got these and they looked good! She said if you like blue cheese this is for you. The staff is very attentive and friendly and the ambiance is unique and fun in a pulp fiction sort of way. Pinky's also has a full compliment of beers on tap and liquor. The only thing I'm not fond of is the way the serve your food in these cheap looking paper boxes. It's not very appealing to the eyes. Parking is limited but there are designated spaces available across the street at Duncan D.  This is a great place to take a date, friends, family or dine alone at the bar."}
{"text":"PInky's is one of the best things to happen on the West side of Charlotte. Great service, great food, great bar. Try the White Trash Burger!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered takeout over the weekend and we weren't really impressed with the food. We ordered a falafel wrap, a hot dog, a pimento grilled cheese, a side of sweet potato fries and a side of onion rings. The falafel was very bland. It didn't taste like much and they really missed the mark on making what should be such a flavorful dish. Although I didn't eat much of the wrap, I will say that the pickles were a nice twist! The hot dog was fine and the pimento grilled cheese was probably my favorite. (You can't go wrong with lots of tasty cheese!) The sweet potato fries didn't have much flavor either and the onion rings were unbelievably OILY! Our takeout bag was soaked in oil that had spilled from the box that the onion rings were in and there was still a pool of oil sitting in the bottom of the box. They were very soggy and unappetizing! I would be willing to try something else from Pinky's again. Hopefully we'll have better luck next time!"}
{"text":"Had the Big John with chipotle mayo and substituted the swiss cheese with pimiento.  AMAZING trust me this is the best way to have Big John!!!!  Best chicken sandwich ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs and drinks. Scene more for the biker crowd. Lunch crowd is rather large for get there early."}
{"text":"Wow all I can say is that I will Drive to there other location. It is worth the drive. The server was very nice but that was about it food came out and the pimp and fries and it tasted like old grease and maddie paddy well that was just as bad. I brought the fries to the waiter attention so I have to wonder if that why my burger came out like it did."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options, the falafel salad and vegetarian chili are amazing. To the point that I seriously thought this is freaking regular chili, they totally didn't hear me say veggie. Try it, great place."}
{"text":"Cool vibe. Waffle fries with housemade pimento cheese and a ton of bacon are amazing. Good local beer."}
{"text":"Been there several times.  Very good fast casual food at very good prices.  $3.50 for a fresh hamburger.  Sweet Potato fries fresh and delish.  Had a Greek Pita sandwich that was full of appealing new tastes.  The portions are single human size, to match the good prices.  Staff very friendly.  All-Hard surfaces and loud juke box make it noisy inside, so no intimate conversations possible. but the terrace, though by a busy intersection isn't bad.    The wait staff is terrific, friendly and attentive--- and entertaining with their abundant face furniture and colorful hair and tatoos.  A refreshing dash of panache in an otherwise rather sterile suburban setting."}
{"text":"Unique menu selections. The food came out fresh, hot and good! Great customer service, everyone stops to check on you. That was very refreshing. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ok,  From Orlando, lived in Charlotte in 2000 and 2001, when the Penquin opened, grew to love the Penquin and the trio! Miss you guys, and good luck with Pinky's, still need to find out WTF, but that'll come, Until next time! Rev IT!"}
{"text":"A must place to eat at. The fried pickles are out of this world. Corn dogs - so fresh!!! The white trash burger is the bomb. And who would have thought peanut butter on a chicken sandwich would be good?  Just a great place to eat  - atmosphere is awesome and service very good!!!"}
{"text":"it sucks food is nasty I will not be going back"}
{"text":"Pinky's is the perfect spot for when you're craving a burger & beer. As a vegetarian, this still rings true because they're super veg friendly & can customize most orders!"}
{"text":"If you ever wanted proof that 95% of the people who post reviews on Yelp are impossible to please dickheads who whine about everything and are never happy....this is it. This place is 5 stars all day long.....anyone giving it a low rating is an idiot. Best bar food in Charlotte without anyone else being close. Great wings, great sandwiches, lots of options.  Just go and find out for yourself."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. ..workers working hard. Parking sucks. Burgers are just ok...fun place to visit I would go there if you are hungry"}
{"text":"I love the crab puppies, I love the Ding Dong Chicken sandwich, they serve Cheerwine- that could very possibly be my last meal. I can't tell you much else about the menu because I can't bring myself to order anything else. My kids seem to love the hotdogs, the fried squash was good but had to compete with the rest of the food and lost. Sorry, squash.  I love the juke box, Galaga, and photo booth offerings. I do not love the long waits (but can deal with it) or the lack of parking- the lot across the street scares me at night."}
{"text":"This place has a super cool atmosphere and the food is good but know that it is super super greasy!!!!  That is why this place isnt one of my personal favorites but its always packed!!!  The staff is ok also, not overly attentive but they get the job done.  I think there are much better places in Charlotte to eat."}
{"text":"Fried pickles amazing!!! Ding dong chicken sandwich and white trash burger so good too! Service was fast and super friendly!"}
{"text":"I went for greasy bar food and usually it does the trick but this time however the shrimp corn dogs were way too much batter not enough shrimp and the same could be said about the crab hush puppies. I think my stomach won't forgive me. But the beer special was great $3 craft beer roulette everyone is a winner!"}
{"text":"First time reviewer. Pinky's food is very good.  I am LONG time \"waddling bird\" customer and I have to say, Pinky's food is even better.  Now, I did NOT get a burger here.  Instead I got the fried pickles, white bean humus and a chicken/spinach salad (my creation) and they all 3 were very good.  I AM impressed.  Good job y'all!"}
{"text":"Corn dog Shrimp is the best thing on earth! We are looking forward to one opening in Huntersville soon. We are looking forward to trying more things on the menu. The staff is great too."}
{"text":"Man at Costco: Hey Dion! How do you like Charlotte?   Me: Love it...lots to do, friendly people, the weather...great places to eat.   Man at Costco: have you been to Pinky's? Aww man, imma telling you, if y haven't, just go to Pinky's!   (This guy proceeded to tell me how fabulous the restaurant is for a good 5 minutes. Damn. I better go...I didn't want to let him down!)  Pinky's is like a traditional diner...but so much more! Loud, eclectic music, tattoos friendly servers, nice retro tiki infused decor, lots of drinks and cheap, delicious grub.   The crab hush puppies are just what everyone says they are. Deliciously soft and tender on the inside, with plenty of crab bits, nicely crisp exterior. The batter and crab is slightly sweet, and the tartar has a nice creamy tang. Big portion for the price.   Veggie chili dog: dios mio! The soy dog is dee-lonk-u-lous. I'm a meat eater, but didn't feel like the heaviness of a meat dog. The soy is slightly smoky, the chili flavorful and the slaw sweet and crunch. I like their buns, steamed and sort and perfectly squishy.   Squash Chips: my only criticism is I'd like the slices to be a bit thicker for squash taste...but other than that, also delicious. Not too much batter to weigh things down. Comes with a cool ranch.   Falafel sandwich: can run with the best of em. Flavorful, lots of depth from hummus and pickled veggies.   Banana Pudding: this is the super creamy kind-- not too yellow, lots of banana slices and vanilla wafers. The bananas were a bit too brown in some spots...but that's what bananas do when exposed to air. Delicious and rich.   The servers are efficient and friendly, will make suggestions if asked. Liked the plastic disposable plates, which made things easy and super casual.  The bathroom is super clean and surprisingly upscale.   Our bill was less than $26 including a sweet tea. We left stuffed and happy and planning our next visit and what to order!"}
{"text":"For a quick style hamburger joint, this place is excellent. The service is amazing and the food is delicious. Try the ding-dong style burger, unique and yummy."}
{"text":"Best place in Charlotte I'very found for burgers & I've looked all over.  A lot of the other highly rated burger places have decent burgers but are more of a hangout spot & thus highly rated. Pinky's is a quaint little spot where you go for the food & drinks, not because you know all your friends will be there on a saturday night.  All the components on the burger are excellent, fresh jalapeños,  leaf lettuce, ripe tomato,  soft bun, tender good quality beef, nice size patty & excellent value!!!  This is one of those places that a keen eye can discern that a lot of work went into every ingredient that goes into their menu items.  I don't believe it gets the credit it deserves due to the fact that the burgers are only $4-5!  Great waffle fries & lots of other great options for meat eaters & vegetarians alike.  Atmosphere & service have always been very good as well.  FYI....I wrote this review after going there about 10 times & always enjoying the food but the last time I went I felt inclined to write a review (which I never do) because I got the white trash burger with everything on it, simply put, the best burger I've ever had in Charlotte.  One more thing....to the person below that claims to have gotten sick from Pinky's, maybe check your medications because getting food poisoning twice from the same place is extremely unlikely especially if your visits aren't close together & I've been here about 10 times without any issues & my team goes there every week after our game without issues so I'm to assume it's you & not the establishment."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, good beer and a great atmosphere.  Look for the Volkswagon Beetle on the roof.  Rumor has it that this place is run by the people that ran The Penguin (a Charlotte institution) for decades.  They've split with ownership and opened Pinky's.  It has the same vibe and great food at inexpensive prices.  I haven't confirmed all of this, but it's generally accepted as fact in Charlotte...maybe its just an urban legend.  I had the Ding Dong chicken sandwich, which is slaw, sirachi, and crunchy peanut butter. I was suspicious of this combo at first, but am now a believer.  I didn't expect it (maybe I'm just slow), but the combination tasted Thai inspired, almost like pad thai.  I also had the sweet potato fries, also good.    Definitely will be going back to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome staff and solid food. Definitely one of my favorite stops in Huntersville. The food and drink prices are also super reasonable.  The turkey burgers and black bean/veggie burgers are towards the top of my list for options. The buffalo shrimp salad is also fantastic."}
{"text":"Finally tried Pinky's for the first time last weekend.  We sat on their patio and enjoyed the beautiful sunny day.  The menu consists of your typical 'junk food' type food....chili dogs, burgers, corn dogs, fries, etc.  After spending the morning hiking in the heat this was exactly the type of food we were craving.  We ordered a cheese burger, corn dog, french fries and sweet potato fries.  Everything tasted great and the prices were pretty damn cheap too.  We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Go early so you don't have to wait. Fried pickles are delicious.... well, everything was!  We tried the roulette beer ( waitress goes in fridge and grab you a random  beer) but unfortunately I didn't like mine. It was a porter. Fun restaurant for kids too."}
{"text":"Location, location, location!  West Side!  Just kidding...but no...really...West Side!  Pinky's is so convenient and easy to get to.  Just a small hop off of the freeway and BAM...burger's in your mouth!  I love how Pinky's has their shat together.  It gets busy for lunch during the week, and they'll still get you in and out without the hassle.    Lunch isn't exactly the best time for Pinky's though.  This place is about atmosphere, ambiance, and a bit of grit.  Come here to relax and tip a couple of cold ones.  Some people like to get concert t-shirts and autographs...I just want to stain my old PBR shirt with fried pickle juice and pimento cheese grease.    The food here is atypical bar fare mingled with some traditional grub.  I personally love the buffalo shrimp tacos.  The fried pickles are also a must...and they'll be sure to let you know that if you used to go to that \"other\" unscrupulous joint, that those pickles are now residing at Pinky's.  You know what I'm saying (winky face).  Sorry...couldn't picture myself typing a semi-colon and a parentheses to make a winky face.    Try this place...then come back!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on Friday and they had their fried flounder for a special! Yay! Crispy, flavorful and light with just the right amount of seasoning. Loved the slaw, tartar sauce and fries (waffle style). I would have loved to have had a beer, but we had to go back to work! It's no problem to park across the street for this delicious food!"}
{"text":"It is ridiculous they no longer allow dogs on the patio. Service sucks also. Will not be back to this location.  Dog hating hippies."}
{"text":"The BEST banana pudding I've had from a restaurant! I go to Pinkys just to order the banana pudding"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant!   The food is good and with enough of a twist to be unique to the area.    It's always busy and the service is great!    The only problem is with parking, since the restaurant is in a business strip mall, the parking lot fills up fast."}
{"text":"Was just kicked out of Pinky's.  Had the nerve to show up at 10:30 with a party of six and was told to leave and that they did not want to serve any more people.  Sad.  Updated 8/4 - based on very constructive direct feedback From the owner I am updating my review."}
{"text":"Amazing experience, good vibes with the food. Always a really good place to go and bring friends from out of town. And do you and Greg really know how to do it!"}
{"text":"In Charlotte for work and found this place online. Great place. This is the kind of joint you'd have to come to everyday for a month because you want to try everything on the menu. Started with the crab hush puppies. Great taste and a very generous portion for the price. Moved on to the burgers. Go with a double as the single leaves you wanting more and the triple is a beast. Also tried the Corn Dog Shrimp and it was incredible. The cornmeal coating was out of this world. And you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"This is my first night here. The food is great the drinks are on point. I also meet dutches and cease from black ink group   Great!!!"}
{"text":"Pinkys has some of the best service around. It's always a good experience. The staff tag teams each table which makes for great customer service. You are never left waiting for a refill or condiments etc. Food is great too!"}
{"text":"Clutch spot. Staff was so helpful & nice. Chicken tacos, fried pickles & burgers were awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! Ordered the corn dog shrimp because it was on DDD! It was amazing!!!!! Also the fried pickles were wonderful! Try the wasabi ranch!!  Friendly staff that checked on us every couple of minutes!   Just couldn't have asked for better service or food!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of classmates, tried the crab puppies and inspite of the rave reviews they were not good. Heavily breaded, and not much crab really not what I expected.  Mixed reviews from the others that were a part of the group as well. Maybe I will give them another try at a later time. Servers were nice, and attentive."}
{"text":"The parking's always full but all the places across the streets seemed to have spaces so it wasn't any trouble at all. It's my boyfriend and I's first time there and we were seated immediately during the lunch rush. The waitresses and staff were accommodating and prompt, our glasses were never less then half full! The waitress recommended the Kickin' Chicken tacos and oh my goodness, they were amazing! Best tacos I've had, and trust me, I've had a lot of tacos in this lifetime.  I totally recommend this place! The music's great, the staff was friendly, and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"I've visited Pinky's a number of times in the past and always have left full and happy.  The owner and employees seem to be very down to earth and enjoy being there.  That attitude carries over making this quaint little burger joint a fun place to be.  The menu items may sound odd, but give them a try.  The burgers are great but there are many other options as well.  My kids devour the corn dogs and the fried pickles disappear about as quickly as they hit the table.  I had the chance to try out the edamame hummus; it was fantastic and I do not even like hummus.  Only downsides include the location and lack of specific gluten free items.  With regards to the location, if you are not familiar with the area it could be difficult to find in the shopping center.  You either have to turn in at a light well before the center or go past and come back.  Don't give up as their burgers are better than the chain location in the shopping center.  As for the gluten free options, be sure to ask what is available.  They have a number of items on their menu that are gluten free by default, they just are not advertised as such."}
{"text":"Between its role in Penguingate, the similarities of the menu and, y'know, Greg Auten, the chef who made the Penguin what it was, it's hard not to compare Pinky's to The Bird. But Pinky's stands up to the comparison and... dare I say it... may even be better.  Penguin regulars will see many old friends on Pinky's menu, which includes fried pickles and \"Pinky's Westside,\" aka a small block southern style. Tastewise, they hold their own. But Pinky's is striking out on its own, too. There are waffle fries on the menu, which are always welcome, and there are even--GASP!--some healthy options. The \"kinda fried turkey\" sandwich is delicious, with flavorful, perfectly poached turkey and bacon. The Nature Boy, Pinky's version of a veggie burger, is clearly housemade, a nice alternative to the Boca burger afterthoughts most restaurants throw at the vegetarians in the room. There's something for everyone on the menu without feeling like they threw everything on there.  I'll always have a soft spot for the Penguin, but with more options, air conditioning and *almost* enough room for the hungry customers, I think it's safe to say Pinky's will do just fine on its own."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Pinky's. It's definitely one of my go-to lunch/low-key dinner places.   The fried pickles are absolutely a must. I'd rather get them on the side of my burger than fries - they're that good. They're exactly the right ratio of salty pickle to crisp breading.   You also have to try at least one thing \"Ding Dong Style.\" I would never have thought of putting peanut butter and saracha on a sandwich, but as a combo, it can't be beat! The Ding Dong Chicken is one of my favorites.  The wait staff is always fast, friendly and helpful, too, so it's a pleasure to grab a bite here."}
{"text":"Really good place to eat anytime. The burgers, dogs, and fries are very delicious."}
{"text":"Whenever I feel the need to punish my cardiovascular system, Pinky's is the one place I'll go to. What's surprising and pleasant about Pinky's is that for all of the heart-attacks-on-a-bun they offer, there's quite a few healthier options to choose from. I always enjoy the Green Chile Pork sandwich, marinated pork grilled with pineapple slices, melted swiss cheese, arugula and jamaican mayonnaise on a seeded bun. Delicious! And I chase that burger down with some chili fries and a PBR. I did say \"healthy,\" right? Oh, screw it. My personal trainer can get pissed off at me all she wants.   Pinky's satisfies my craving for greasy delights, ever since the demise of the original Penguin - I still miss that joint. In fact, some of the staff from the former Penguin have made their way to Pinky's, so it's nice to see them there.   So whenever I feel the need to tell my body to go get bent, and load myself up on dripping grease and stupidly hot fried pickles, we make a bee line for Pinky's, and gladly wait for a table. It does stay crowded - seriously, I waited 30 minutes for a table at 3PM! - so get there early. Pinky's will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Fun little joint to grab a bite and an adult beverage! I think every staff person waited on me! Definately not Lacking in customer service!!"}
{"text":"Not likely going back.  The food looked promising but was just not our style.  The staff was very good."}
{"text":"The bacon is unlimited! I had a salad and a burger which were both delicious! Casual vibe and quick service!"}
{"text":"I think everyone knows about Pinky's by now. The burgers are simple, inexpensive and very good. Actually, everything on the menu is good. Definitely try the crab puppies."}
{"text":"I love, love, love the food here. The parking lot is HORRIBLE. If you're closer to Huntersville, go to that location - ample parking. I get that this ambiance is loud and trendy.. but there should be levels of acceptable noise."}
{"text":"I love Pinky's. I haven't found too many local restaurants that have a vibe or prices like Pinky's. The burgers are great and inventive. The fries and crabpuppies are great. It's easy to order too much food here, because the prices are so awesome. The drink menu is very fun and very reasonable. I have never had to wait to eat here, but I've seen it busy even though it's a bit out of the way. Crane machine and photo booth are in the lobby area, which is always fun. I haven't had their desserts, but they always have fun cakes as options. Go, but don't go too much so I can keep getting sat quickly."}
{"text":"Came here because didn't wanna do a lot this year with the house hopping around. Sat down enjoyed myself. I recommend the Triple G. Guaranteed once you see it you'll be amazed."}
{"text":"Love this place, great local hangout and good food"}
{"text":"Finally tried out Pinky's for dinner and loved it!  The menu consists of basic American grill food with a few twists.  I had some delicious fried fish tacos that lulled me close to food narcolepsy.  Atmosphere is casual and personable, with good service - I felt like I was in a neighborhood hangout (though this little section of town is more of a crossroads than a neighborhood).  The bar area is great, with some nice selections on tap.  Pricing is affordable as well - on both the food and drinks.  I was amused that the food was served with plastic utensils and disposable trays and would have liked to see something more solid - but I guess it adds to the atmosphere and savings on a dishwasher?  Brilliant place for casual dining and relaxing."}
{"text":"Hands down this hole in the wall is now my favorite place in Charlotte to go. They're chicken salad is a fried dish that was heaven sent. The staff is extremely attentive and answered any question we had. They have many interesting things to look at while you are there. Word of warning, parking and seating is limited so get there early and make sure your party is in the building. They won't seat you until everyone is there. Keep up the awesome food! I will definitely be coming back after vacation."}
{"text":"Appetized with white bean hummus which also had marinated artichokes and olives on the side. Total win. Followed this with a white trash burger which was also spectacular. Prices are cheap and great service."}
{"text":"Saw it on tv and decided to stop in on our road trip. Had an expected 20 minute wait. There's really no where to wait because the place is pretty small but they hustled to get us seated. For starters, the interior of the place is awesome! The walls are covered with random pop art and throw back items. Totally loved it. Great beer selection too I cannot stress enough how good the corn dog shrimp were. The combo of the shrimp in corn dog batter is genius. I had the white trash burger and it was amazing. I didn't put it down. My only complaint is the 'medium well' patty. It was still very good and juicy but I prefer medium to medium rare and it erks me when a place doesn't allow for preference. Needless to say the wife had the patty melt and daughter got the chicken Sammy with peanut butter. I get it now. The Thai food flavors. Wasn't a fan of the Cole slaw and the shoe string onion rings aren't my cup of tea either. I thought I was getting real onion rings.  Those negatives are so minor though. I loved stopping here for lunch. The food was awesome and the best for last, the service was outstanding. Very friendly staff. Btw, that ghost busters pinball machine is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back. A bit of a wait but it was delicious. I didn't go too adventurous with my chicken philly main meal but it was still really good. The fries with chili and pimento cheese were out of this world and oh so healthy as well as the shrimp in corn dog batter which was unique and we're ate up fast. Everything that I saw looked and smelled great."}
{"text":"I liked place a lot...till i came back home. I GOT FOOD POISONING! All I ate that my husband and son didnt eat was a Big John chicken sandwich. My stomach still hurts a lot! And I hope i didnt get salmonella poisoning!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Charlotte (or Huntersville). The food is always amazing and the staff are awesome.  They are always on the mark and keep your glass full and your needs met.  The daily specials are amazing and always a great addition to the regular menus.  Best fried pickles and the crab puppies are the bomb.  What's in that house made tarter sauce that makes me want to eat it with a spoon??"}
{"text":"I had their black bean burger and it was delicious! Can't wait to go back and check out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"White trash burger. Check. Fried pickles. Check. Plenty of local and regional brewskis. Check. If only this place had an old VW bug on the roof, it would be complete...hmm."}
{"text":"Best burger in town at the price! Diamond is a close 2nd, but this joint is the best! Rest of the menu is strong, great beer specials, and always inviting staff!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte.  Everything here is amazing. The hot dogs, corn dogs, burgers, crab puppies, desserts... everything!"}
{"text":"Great, reasonably priced food with a nice bohemian local vibe"}
{"text":"Pinky's is a fun little place that has a wide, varied menu that tries to be different and pretty much succeeds.  I've eaten there about 6 times in the last year, most recently last Saturday and although they are almost always busy they do a great job of getting you a table quickly, usualy end up waiting 5-10 minutes or sit at the bar.  Started with the Pimpn Fries, I recommend adding the bacon...everything is better with bacon.  Had the fish tacos and they were lightly battered and perfectly crispy.    Overall it's a fun place for a quick out of the ordinary lunch.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried here is DELICIOUS. The Pimp'N Fries are a must. Lots of creative choices on the menu. The staff is friendly and super-efficient. Large cocktail menu in addition to beer and wine."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Nice atmosphere, went during the lunch time and it was packed. Order the \"white trash burger\" thought it was pretty good (love fried pickles) waffle fries were good. Really everything on the menu look good. A lot of drink specials, definitely would come back and recommend this place for a good time with friends"}
{"text":"Pinky's is our usual eatery when we're nearby, and it never fails to come through. From the fried pickles to the wonderful hamburgers, I've never had a bad experience here. My favorite is the White Trash Burger, which is loaded with fried pickles, provolone cheese and spicy ranch dressing. That's Fat Boy Heaven right there. The onion rings are awesome as well. Sliced thin and fried crisp, then piled high. Yum.  Finish off the meal with some banana pudding. It's the best I ever ate in a restaurant, and ALMOST as good as my wife's homemade dessert.  Give Pinky's a try, I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Still trying to figure out what the rave is about. Everything is either fried or not really that good. We live fairly close so we keep trying new things. Great bar..."}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere, food and drink selection!! We went on a Friday evening and there a short wait but it well worth it!! Great price for what you get as well. Looking forward to going back and trying more of their delicious menu options!!"}
{"text":"Went here today with a few friends. The food here is pretty cheap and the portions were good. The service here was quick and friendly, we always had staff check up on our table with little disturbance to us. The music selection here is excellent, plus you can pick music from the jukebox up front! So onto the food, we shared three appetizers:  Greg's Pickles (Fried dill pickle chips) - served with ranch dip, nothing spectacular but it was pretty good.  Pimp'n Fries - melted cheese over waffle fries, if you get this ADD THE BACON, but again it wasn't spectacular or one of the best fries I've had.  CRAB PUPPIES - NOW THIS WAS AMAZING, basically these are hushpuppies with crabmeat served with a dipping sauce (I could not remember what the dipping sauce was but it was awesome). They were crispy, sweet, and deeeelicious! I'd go back to Pinky's just for these!  Then, I had their Pterodactyl burger with everything on it and cheese added. It wasn't anything special, just felt like another burger to me, plus the meat was a little on the dry side which was a little bit offputting to me, but it was a decent burger.  I want to give Pinky's 4 stars for the atmosphere and great service, but the food wasn't super amazing to me, I'd be willing to go back to Pinky's to try other items on the menu though. I'd give Pinky's 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about Pinky's.  I've been twice and the menu reads great and both times I got excited, but in the end found the food didn't live up to the description.  I hate it when that happens!   We tried different dishes each time and while they were all fine, none of them delivered the punch we expected.  We've had great service both times and the place itself is clean and fun/inviting.  Maybe I just haven't ordered the right thing yet?"}
{"text":"Consistently good. Great menu. Very diverse. Something for everyone. My wife's a vegetarian and loves the meat substitution options."}
{"text":"The burgers and wings are pretty tasty, if you ever get them. The service leads a lot to be desired. We've given this location 3 tries and haven't had luck yet.  We wait and wait to give our drink orders and then wait longer to order food. And it takes a while to get what you order. This most recent visit we waited 5 minutes for someone to come take our drink orders. 5 minutes later she brought the drinks and then she disappeared. So after 10 more minutes we had to track someone down to get food ordered.  20 minutes later and we had food. I know it's a table service restaurant but we're talking about burgers and wings, not a hand carved steak at Mortons. Don't get me wrong, everyone is very nice, I'm just not sure if they have a sense of urgency when it comes to waiting on their customers.   One other frustrating thing. If you get a cheeseburger, be aware it's served in a paper lined basket so plan on spending a decent amount of time peeling paper off your cheese during diner."}
{"text":"THIS IS A BAR.  THIS IS A PLACE TO GO SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SEE KIDS.  I HAVE KIDS TO I TAKE THEM TO APPLEBEES.  This is a neighborhood bar that happens to have food.  Nine dollar pitchers, 2.50 pints and very good wings.  Guys-  go there with 5 other guys and have fun.  Gals -  Do the same.   This is a bar not a five star restaurant.  Go to Capital Grille, BUT IT COSTS MONEY.  This is not a KID PLACE ... NEITHER IS LAS VEGAS... The bartenders in here are Excellent."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to a place that appeared on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives, to Pinky's Westside Grill in Charlotte.  Dora here. Don't be alarmed not to find a spot directly in front of the diner. Just at the end of the strip, you'll find ample parking, a plus for any business near downtown. The inside was jammed for a Sunday lunch.  For my lunch, I ordered the White Trash Burger, which includes provolone, fried pickles, and onion rings with a spicy ranch sauce and a side of onion rings (straws). For some reason, the burger that arrived had raw pickles and onions with mayonnaise. The burger was OK, a little over cooked for my taste, but served on a soft bun. Maybe if it would have been served as advertised on the menu, I would have been more impressed. The onion rings were good, but a little greasy.  Dora here. Check out the popcorn chicken, little nuggets of breaded and fried white meat, served atop waffle fries with a side of slaw. I'm a huge fan of chicken, fried or grilled, so when I saw this on the menu, I couldn't convince myself to go with something more adventuresome. Like Pimp'n Fries (waffle fries topped with chili and melted pimento) or the Asian-inspired Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich, marinated chicken slathered with peanut butter, hot sauce and slaw. I probably should've worked up the courage because the chicken could've used less time in the fryer; the outside was a bit dry and brittle. Awesome waffle fries, though, light on the seasoning and not too-potatoey as some tend to be.  Still Dora. Pinky's tag-team friendly servers ensure that your cup never runs dry. And if the crowd hanging around outside on a Sunday afternoon and the awesome reviews are any indication, we might've caught them on an off day.   We rate this restaurant 3 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving good food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"From my one visit recently, I say 5 for the vibe, 5 for the Pimpin' Fries (great!), 3 for the chicken sandwich (no turkey burger available when I was there), 2 for parking, and 2 for the staff member who first refused to seat our party. We were there abt 6:00, so the place was virtually empty before dinner. Only two of our party of three had arrived. My guest was from out of state, and we just wanted to sit at a table with a beer and talk while we waited 5 minutes for the 3rd person. The staff member ultimately did seat just the two of us, after a bit of discussion."}
{"text":"This is a must place to come to on the West Side of town! I have been here several times, and the service has always been the best! You can't go wrong with any thing on the menu.  That Triple G! WOW and the Corndog Shrimp!  When you top it off with HOME MADE DESSERTS! Just be ready to eat some amazing food...."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! It's so different and unique which goes with the theme of the restaurant. All the staff are super friendly. This is one of my favorite places to eat. I highly recommend trying the ding dong chicken. But I'm giving this 4 stars, because it took so long to get seated and even longer to get our food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Funky cool staff, atmosphere and menu! Great value and delicious! Nice Charlotte skyline view while you devour your juicy burger? Why not?! Definitely try it out a lot!"}
{"text":"Dear God, please help subdue my cravings for Pinky's vegetarian corn dog. They really have gotten in the way of my daily thinking routine and basic problem solving skills.   I've been back here at least 4 times for the said \"one and only\" and it's on point perfect every single time!  Recently, I have re-tried the Pimpin' Fries (waffle fries smothered in pimento cheese) and I loved them.  My boyfriend and I ordered the White Bean & Rosemary Hummus appetizer last week. This app is a steal for $6.75! The basket they bring it in is chocked full of fresh goodies. An ample scoop of the creamy, yummy hummus; nestled by artichokes, tomatoes, chopped calamata olives, red onion, and plenty of fresh pita.  Boyfriend ordered the Uptown Tuna Melt, which he liked, but said it paled in comparison to the hummus and my veggie corn dog, ha!   Also, I give Da PImp grilled pimento cheese 4 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place! Unique dishes and everything I've ever eaten there tastes great! Waiters/waitresses are always friendly. Fun environment good music. Only reason not 5 star is I wished they stayed open later."}
{"text":"Checked out this place for the first time after living in Charlotte for the last few months. I often passed by Pinky's during lunch and was always impressed by the crowd. I finally caved in after seeing some of the reviews here and just had to check it out.  Me and some others decided to head over for lunch on a Monday and with the weather being so fantastic were lucky enough to enjoy some of the semi-outdoor  seating (covered but with large garage doors opening up to the outside).  Our order looked something like this...  Hush Puppies to start.....  The food was awesome if you are in a burger, hot dog and fried food type of mood. I cant say enough about the service. Out waitress was really laid back but attentive and personable.  I'll give 4/5 because of the pricing. Although I wouldn't call this place expensive by any sense of the word the pricing did seem a bit off. For example, some things felt over-priced in comparison to other items on the menu.  On the other hand, you couldn't beat the pitcher price of $9 for Shock Top. That was a deal we couldn't pass up.  All in all, a great experience for awesome food, incredible service and a fantastic little outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"I love burgers and Pinky's does burgers well! Make sure you try it Ding Dong Style if you're feeling adventurous! The staff is very attentive...you don't have one specific server so everyone is making an effort to ensure your satisfaction"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place out after reading great reviews.  However after trying it out, we will probably not be returning.  I had the ding dong chicken ( dont care for the name) it was pretty bad. I was expecting some awesome tasty chicken sandwich but it just tasted like a peanut butter sandwich with chicken in it. blah. I can make this at home.   My husband had the white trash burger and he also thought his was whatever. Considering that there are so many burger joints around Charlotte, we will probably not be returning."}
{"text":"It was ok, did not live up to the hype! I expected better food by the hype and the packed restaurant and parking lot."}
{"text":"Placed an online order through uber eats and they cancelled it. I called and while they sounded apologetic, they said they cancelled because they're too busy. What kind of business cancels a $58 order they don't have to worry about delivering themselves?"}
{"text":"Our first time visiting and we will be back! My chicken sandwich was delicious. Started with the fried pickles...the best I've had. The coating was light and crispy. My husband had the turkey salad and it was very filling."}
{"text":"Love the location since we live right in Wesley  Heights.  Awesome decor with lots of low brow interesting photos and stickers on the walls. Great beer selection and the staff is really friendly. The food, delicious and creative. Now for the tactical part of my review.  Every time we eat there I get sick, like someone in the kitchen needs to wash their  hands kind of sick. It makes me so sad because it's such a cool place and I have a pretty strong constitution so I'm not sure what is going on there."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to check this place out.  The food was really good. It was hot and I liked the dipping sauces. Perfect for a Saturday summer lunch. It's heavy food though so it's not a health spot folks. Loved the corn dog shrimp. Yes that's right Corn Dog Shrimp."}
{"text":"I have been longing for the Penguin's fried pickles since they closed.  I tried The Burger Co, no dice, weird breading.  So when we stopped into Pinky's for lunch I HAD to try the pickles.    Don't tell anyone, but I think their fried pickles are better than Penguin's!  The ranch has some oomph to it that Penguin lacked.    I got the Matty Patty Melt.  it was fantastic.  The burgers are on the small side, but you can double any burger.  I can't wait to come back and try the corn dogs, especially the veggie corn dog and check out the beer list (drinking at noon on a Monday, kind of frowned upon)  I love how varied the menu is, there is literally something for everyone.  You can't beat being able to satisfy even the most die hard greasy burger fan and a picky vegetarian at the same time.    my only complaint was with the waffle fries, they were pretty boring, but i'm sure smothered in pimento they'd be better."}
{"text":"Really excellent burger and a 5 star corn dog.  Really outstanding corn dog!  I'm saying it twice because I would not have expected it to be so dang good based on corn dogs sampled at other restaurants.  Did not have the french fries, so no comment on them.  Onion rings while ok, were not in the same league as the burger or cd.  I think a thicker ring would have worked much better.  I should have had a 2nd corn dog instead of the rings.  Burger was a single because of the addition of the corn dog.  The doubles and triples looked outstanding and I would expect just that much more delish-i-ness (?) by adding more patties and cheese.  Hats off to the cooks!  Bartenders are attentive and I was never thirsty.  Muchas gracias!  I may have been the only non-tattooed person in the place, but no issue with that whatsoever.  Everyone seems like really nice peeps.  Great music.  Too many IPA's for my taste and would have liked a nice micro-brewed lager, but ended up drinking PBR's which were just fine with the excellent burgers and cd's.  Only 4 stars due to the onion rings, but y'all are doing great things..."}
{"text":"Service is always super friendly and the food is fast and fresh.  You really can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches and the fried pickles are a must.  It's crowded and loud but I eat there anyway.  If parking and seating didn't suck this would be 5 star review."}
{"text":"Not the healthiest food but great service, great atmosphere and great prices. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Yumm!!!  Was on a road trip from Virginia to Georgia when we stopped and ate at this place. It was so good that I wanna go back to Charlotte just to eat here!!!  The cheese pimiento fries were really really good omg. I never had the American cheese pimiento before and they were really good on fries. I was in heaven  I got corn dogs shrimps or something and those were really good too. It was way too much food! My boyfriend got the buffalo shrimp tacos and his dad got a salad since he was on a diet... I felt bad for him watching us eat all this delicious fried food. He definitely had willpower. But he said that his salad was really really good.   I love this place and want to go back! I don't know why the bill came out to a lot even though everything seemed really cheap. It was just three main things and an appetizer but I don't care, the food is so good I'll go back somehow!!! Cheese pimiento fries pls~  pros food is yummy!  cons somehow bill is more than u expect not the healthiest option but i dont care bout dat"}
{"text":"Out of towner and my buddy took me here straight from the airport. Absolutely straight comfort food (aka not healthy per se) and absolutely tasty. I had the white trash burger...thats the actual name, not inciting any trouble, and we had some crab tots, wings , and sweet potato fries. Like I said comfort food but all well done, its no wonder that there was a line to get seated. If its your first time in charlotte or the south you must try the sweet tea but be warned it is an acquired taste. FYI there is a burger/sandwich on the menu that has crunchy peanut butter on it so if your bold....."}
{"text":"Our 1st time here after hearing of it on triple d!! I had the Triple G and loved it. I don't even like slaw. I might could've eaten another. My girlfriend had the hot dog with chili and loved hers as well! We cannot wait to go back! Parking is a bit of a challenge, but who cares with food this good!"}
{"text":"Pinky's Westside Grill. This place is super divey looking from the outside. There is not much parking at the actual restaurant itself, but just around the corner is a large dirt parking lot. Walking up this place just reminds me of something from the beach, back from many years ago. Super colorful and a smell of food floating through the air says come in and eat now! The menu is 1 large page on 2 sides. There are a lot of things on this menu, so be sure to check it close, you dont want to miss anything. Service was fast and friendly with help on the menu and recommendations. Nice beer list and mixed drinks too. The burgers are a thing of beauty. Huge, well crafted. The single is enough for most people. The double is certain to put you in a food coma, and the triple may put you in a real coma!! The waffle fries as an app with pimento cheese and bacon are amazing. I got the double burger, it was fresh tasting, cooked perfectly and tasted down right awesome. The slaw and chili are good southern classics. Fried squash on the side was cooked up just right, not too greasy and definitely delicious. Cool artwork on every corner. Nice outdoor seating. Nothing to dislike here. 5 stars all the way around. Vibrant."}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for a business trip and decided to stop into Pinky's based on the strong recommendations printed in various Charlotte-area promotional magazines. Well that was a big mistake. The first thing you'll notice when you step inside the building is a plethora of bigoted, hate-filled Democrat Party propaganda stuck all over the walls of the establishment. My (least) favorite of these items was an absolutely disgusting sticker containing a photo of the former NC governor with a drawn-on Hitler mustache containing the words \"Rat McCrory.\" Lovely... call everyone you disagree with politically \"Hitler,\" as if there is any kind of equivalency between the HB2 law and the slaughter of 6 million innocent people. There was similar hateful material strewn across their walls that ruined my appetite while I waited for my meal.  I got a double burger with fries. While they did give me a lot of fries, there was nothing exciting about this meal. The burger was dry, really dry, and not too big either. The bread was not particularly soft and felt stale. The waffle fries lacked flavor and needed a heavy dose of salt and pepper.    I guess the reason why they're promoted so heavily in Charlotte magazines has more to do with their politics aligning with the editors of those publications, rather than their food, because the food was not good. Stay away.  UPDATE 2/19/18: The business owner had the audacity to respond to my review with the ridiculous notion that equating Republicans with a German dictator who murdered 6 million Jews is \"LOVE.\" I don't know whether to laugh at a ghastly attempt at black humor, or to cry that our world would consider an act of pure HATRED for other human beings advertised on the wall of this business as an act of LOVE."}
{"text":"We love the food, the burgers are great, hush puppies are good, and generally the wait staff are extra friendly.  This past visit, I thought the host was a bit abrupt, but maybe he was having a bad day!"}
{"text":"The food is unbelievable... my favorite is the White Trash Burger & The Big John.  The staff is great and our waitress was full of spirit and I absolutely loved her... her name was Halie.  I will be back.  If you decide to go. Ask for Halie. She is wonderful and is there for all your food needs."}
{"text":"Health freaks beware. This is not for you but it is damn good. I came here the other day with some friends and was shocked I waited so long to try this place that is not even a mile away! We walked in and were sat immediately with nice staff and met by our server instantly. We ordered the fried pickles and shrimp puppies. The shrimp puppies dipped in tartar sauce was so tasty and good I could eat five orders and be fine with that. The fried pickles were good as well. For our entrees we ordered the fish tacos, white trash burger and the popcorn chicken salad. I had no idea the small five ounce burger with a fried green tomato would be so filling and tasty. The popcorn chicken salad must have weighed five pounds! It was delicious. The fried tilapia fish tacos were also a winner. We had onion rings and fries which you cant go wrong with anywhere. The service here was great. I think the servers must split tips because everyone comes and checks on you to make sure you are happy at all times. I love the rock style atmosphere they have as well. You don't go to places and here some good old metal or rock anymore. For the price and quality service and food you cannot beat this place."}
{"text":"One of those places that seems to do everything with a nice flair of personality - from the slightly punk decor to the haircuts and spunk of the bartenders to the food. The special of the day (chicken/apple/white cheddar/arugula sandwich on a pretzel bun) was so yummy. The hush puppies were fried perfect, a little oniony, not too oily, steaming hot. It seemed like each detail was executed with \"that much\" more thought to it - unique but nothing to throw you off, and delightful in the details."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere that's loud and fun. Hot dogs are tasty and creative. Buns are sub par. Ours on this trip were dry and nasty. Great beer selection. Great selection for vegetarians too. Family friendly during the day although loud. Definitely be back and hope the bums are fresher and better quality."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times.  It is my girlfriend and I's go to spot.  It's very affordable and it's good food.  Now it's fried food but there are some healthy options, although I would suggest the corn dog shrimp and popcorn chicken buffalo style.  The music's a little loud and the wait staff are hipsters.  I wouldn't take my parents here because I feel they would be annoyed by the loudness.  But, if you don't mind loud music and want a good affordable meal this is the place.  A PBR pitcher is like $5 which is awesome!  Good selection of North Carolina brews.  They have wine and liquor drinks as well as daily drink specials.  So, if you haven't been, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Really great food - I would highly recommend the crab puppies and the white trash burger, but I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Pinkys is AMAZING. It's our go to! Everyone is incredibly friendly. We love the Westside Randy and the Popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"Fun go to spot for drinks and food! Lots of good \"finger\" food and appetizers to go with drinks.  Drinks are very well priced by the pitcher and they come STRONG!  The bar tender that night said \"I make em how I like to drink em\" which is strong and a great win! Corn dogs are second to none!"}
{"text":"Pretty much no parking. Literally 7 spots.  Good food but the wait can be really long during prime time."}
{"text":"okay okay okay, now I do not spend a lot of time in Charlotte but when I do come I spend it with my friend Jose, and he is literally the ambassador of all things amazing to eat in charlotte.   So we come to Pinkys, I originally ordered the like patty melt burger, and her got the Crispy Big John Chicken sandwich......I took him sandwich...I literally don't know WHAT sort of drugs they sprinkle on that sandwich but I insist that ANYONE who comes to charlotte better have the Big John.  It literally is the best chicken sandwich I have ever had I cant stress how good it is....."}
{"text":"If you want good old American food, this is the place. Don't come here if you're on a diet. The drinks are awesome and the food is great, heavy, but super yummy. It's also a great value for what you get"}
{"text":"This restaurant was on a list of places to try in Charlotte.  What a great place to get a burger.  I got the single patty (with fried pickles on the burger- yum!). My Husband did the three patties (whoa) which he had to finish with knife and fork.  The servers were in teams, so three cool servers were constantly coming to the table to check on us.  The decor was full of zombies, vampires, and the miscellaneous macabre. The toddler in our party scored some spider rings to play with while waiting on her hot dog.  Parking was tricky...small lot upfront was tight, but in pulling out to recalibrate where to pull in, we found the parking lot a block behind the place was for Pinky's. All and all, burgers and appetizers and $3 margaritas made for a good dinner in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I thought I wrote a review for Pinky's already? WTF. Again, this is a Friday or Saturday I've been working out all week and I've been meeting my fitness goals and I'm  going to eat something FUN to treat myself so I don't go nazi crazy kind of place. Maybe it's me, yes it's me, I go early to avoid crowds. It is a funky kind of place. Flounder is my fav. Get the flounder on Friday. No I'm not Catholic. I've been to Pinky's 5 times and I usually go with this pretty young girl I like but she is way too young for me but she doesn't mind because I pay for her meal, I like to watch her eat. And she has the best eyes. She is very funky too and she fits right in. The waitresses are always winking at her. Is he your Dad they ask? She always says maybe."}
{"text":"Do not order the Corn dogs!  Yuck.  Was placed in a styrofoam container as a to-go order.  The fact that it melted the container all to heck did not help the taste.  The dog was wrapped in a super crunchy coating that tasted like it was prepared by a grade school cafeteria clerk, and didn't give a crap because it was their last day trying to make everyone suffer with their terrible tasting corn-dogs.  Next.  Waffle fries!  You can't mess them up right?  Womp womp! They're barely cooked, and like a mountain of flimsy tasteless sadness there they go...into the garbage where they belong after one bit.  That being said it was my first visit, and all my friends say the burgers are great!  But for me...I will just skip lunch if this is my only option.  P.S.  I climbed on the  the Triceratops! P.s.s. For Legal Purposes I did not actually climb on the Triceratops."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in Charlotte! The White Trash burger and fried pickles are the best thing I've had there."}
{"text":"Burgers are outstanding.   Pimpin Fries are a must.   But my favorite thing about Pinkys is how kind the servers are to my family. Such a blessing to a guy with a large family."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to do a review of Pinky's but I've procrastinated, but one lazy Saturday night/Sunday morning, here I am.  Let me say this clear- the parking is crap. That's the negative of Pinky's barnone.  And even with that, Pinky's is, without a doubt, fan-freaking-five-star-tastic. Easily the best burger in Charlotte, one of my top-five burger joints across the East Coast, and just plain good, it has everything a fattie could live for.  The best thing you can do is get the White Trash burger, which, I've more than once, called the Redneck burger. .But try anything else. Falafel is great, the chicken variations (Ding Dong chicken, peanut butter and chicken? Say what!?) are brilliant, and the fried pickles, augh.   I think everyone else has covered what I would otherwise say. This place is a must-have, no matter what you like. It has everything, and it's a gem of Charlotte that's a must-go for anyone. Barnone."}
{"text":"It truly is difficult to pinpoint a single style or cuisine when visiting Pinky's as they are a delicious blend of dishes that will satisfy even the harshest critic of them all! Some have labeled them as the best hot dog joint in NC, others will praise it for it's generous selection of vegetarian and vegan options while the rest will refer it to the classic burger joint you've always dreamed of. This grill does everything fresh and hot off the burners, nothing is a miss as far as I'm concerned. When it comes to what to get, let's not forget about the Deep Fried Pickles, the Ding Dong Burgers, Waffle Fries that are through the roof in flavor and crunch, Corn Dog Battered Jumbo Shrimp, Banana Pudding, Southern 500 Dog, Da Pimp, White Trash Burger, Pimento Cheese Fries and more! just sit back and enjoy the fun and cool atmosphere when you get here and enjoy some great classic food, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Go this place for the ambience, service and fine cocktails. Pub style/diner food too. My hubby thought the food overly greasy but I enjoyed the buffalo shrimp tacos. Waitress recommended the nature boy burger and I would try that next time. I had an excellent absolut cocktail - ginger hibiscus. It was the most interesting cocktail I've had, in a good way! Hubby disappointed with white trash burger and ditto daughter with veggie hot dog, but we all agreed the fried pickles and fried squash were excellent. Wonderful batter. Go!"}
{"text":"Awesome eclectic atmosphere, bomb.com burger and good drink specials. We went for lunch and got a table right away. I will def be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Had I been a visitor to Charlotte for the first time and had this meal, I would have rated Pinky's 1 star, never to return.  It was the service and vibe that pushes me to an otherwise generous second star.  The meal was just that freakin' bad.  I know, shame on me for not sending it back immediately.  I was hungry, in a hurry, and had places to be.  My bad!   There were probably four other choices I could have made to let this be a strong 4 star rating.  I had to pick, at my waiters assurance, the Fish Tacos (three $10.25).  The Gorton's Fisherman has served me better \"beer battered tilapia\"!    The menu described it as having honey-cilantro slaw, spicy ranch, and served with a side of black beans.  Apparently they were out of honey, cilantro, and spicy ranch.  At least none of those flavors found their way to my plate.  Had I gone to a supermarket, found the cheapest can of black beans, and heated them up in a microwave adding nothing else for flavoring, they would have been better tasting than the black beans that were part of my meal.  I really wanted to love this place!  Maybe another time I will...."}
{"text":"Our party of six came in here on a cold, rainy Sunday evening.  The place was busy and we were told about a 15-20 minute wait, which turned into 50 minutes.  Meanwhile, smaller parties of 4 were being seated immediately.  The host kept apologizing but that didn't get us seated any sooner.  I saw two tables empty and they could have been pushed together for six people but it didn't happen.  They were given to people who came in after us.  Eventually, we were seated and the waitress did immediately come to take our drink order.  During our wait to be given a table, we had already memorized the menu and decided what we wanted, so she took our food order also.    I ordered the popcorn chicken and husband wanted the corn dog shrimp. I ordered the mixed drink called Unicorn's tears.  Everyone's drinks came but mine.  I had to ask about it and there was another wait because the waitress forgot to put the drink order in.  She apologized and eventually, our food and my drink arrived.  The food was good and husband was pleased with his shrimp.  I didn't like the Southern slaw, but my chicken and waffle fries were fine.  Others in our group were happy with their food also.    I think I would have enjoyed the evening more if it had gone smoother with the seating issue.  I was ready to go somewhere else after the 20 minute mark had passed and seeing others be given a table ahead of us.  I liked the atmosphere, loud music, eclectic people...but it will be awhile before I return."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight. I had the fish tacos and he ordered the buffalo wings and crab cakes and I honestly don't see what all the hype is about. The fish could've been seasoned better, all I could taste was the batter. Over all, everything was just OK."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best!            Music: Metallic Rock, not appealing.  Order: WAFFLE FRIES - Bland  CORN DOG- Yum, actually good  ONION RINGS- taste was ok, but tinny shreds and very oily  HUSH PUPPIES-dry and had onion flavor"}
{"text":"Was visiting Charlotte and was told this place was a must go to. Food was amazing and service was top notch. We ordered the popcorn chicken buffalo style, white trash burger and the bacon cheese fries. Very tasty food!"}
{"text":"So here's the deal. Food (burgers, dogs, sandwiches) is pretty good, cooked well, tasted fine. That is why I gave it a 3. The bad news, service is kind of spotty. The idea of team service is great but only if you don't get forgotten by all the servers. We were left sitting needing a refill on our drinks for quite a while. All the food (including salads) are served in paper containers which kind of cheapens the entire experience, especially when the prices are $8 and up for a meal with a side.  I hate not to give places another shot but nothing made me want to return...it was just so so. And with Killington's right around the corner, why take a chance?"}
{"text":"I like hitting up Pinky's when I'm in a certain mood. It has a chill vibe that always calms me down.  The food is greasy and unhealthy, but not in an overpowering kind of way.  I always get the fried pickles to start, and then usually the garbage burger which is good.  Not huge, but filling.  My only gripe is that they serve everything on little paper plates that don't hold up well under the greasy onslaught of the food, but who cares, it's worth it."}
{"text":"The Olson family enjoyed a most awesome lunch at Pinky's Westside Grill in Charlotte this afternoon. Appetizers included fried sliced pickles, crab cake hush puppies, and waffle fries covered with pimento cheese.  I enjoyed a Black and Bleu Burger which included bleu cheese, BBQ, bacon, and onion rings. Other members had similar artery clogging meals. For the record, I did have a Diet Coke as my beverage.  The staff was personable and attentive to our needs.  You know what comes next:  The diet starts Monday (date to be determined)."}
{"text":"$20 pitchers of mojitos and a menu filled with eclectic options? I'm in. Came here on a Sunday morning for an impromptu brunch with a handful of very hungry friends, and we were not disappointed! We were seated right away, which was impressive for a group our size in a crowded restaurant. We split the pimento cheese fries (definitely add bacon!) and the fried pickles, both of which were delish and exactly what we all wanted after a night out.   The staff was friendly, attentive, and super fun. Would definitely recommend it as a weekend day drinking spot with good, quick food."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger  from here and it was pretty good. I love super beetles so I was in love with them from the start. It's located in a cute little area. We found this place on diners drive ins and dives I believe and we were pleased. We went as we were traveling back home and we stopped by early so the place was empty and we really got to enjoy having it almost all to ourselves.   Can't say I have any complaints from this place."}
{"text":"For some reason, I liked this location better than the Freedom/Moorehead location near Uptown.  There's more room and the service is not so chaotic.  The food seems exactly the same.  This time I had the VEGGIE DOG with VEGGIE CHILI and PIMENTO CHEESE.  Tasty.  But the waffle fries with chili and pimento cheese were even better.  I love that there are so many vegetarian options here.  However, we only go here when we're not trying to eat healthy.   The servers were very kind regarding my toddler running around.  For that reason alone I would return."}
{"text":"Fried, greasy, comfort food at it's best.  Vegetarian friendly!  The service is great, because the servers will all help any table.  The atmosphere is fun - divey.  Even when there is a wait, I've never waited more than 10-15 minutes.   The VEGETARIAN CHILI is a bit sweet for my taste, so I'm not a huge fan of eating a bowl of it, but it's great on a hot dog, burger or fries.    Speaking of hot dogs and burgers, they have vegetarian versions of both, so you don't have to miss out on any of the fun burger combos or corn dogs.  Vegetarian corn dogs!  The breading on the CORN DOG is sweet and corn bread-ish, but lighter and fried.     I had the VEGGIE DOG with CHILI and PIMENTO CHEESE.  Everything about it worked for me.  The dog itself probably isn't that great, but smothered in chili and cheese, it's delicious.    The FRIED PICKLES have a basic flour breading (which I prefer over cornmeal, but not as good as tempura batter).  They were crispy and served with a thick creamy ranch dipping sauce.    My sister enjoyed the SWEET POTATO FRIES.  I'm never a fan, so I'm not a good judge, but I found them to be sweet and limp, not at all what I want from a fry.    The DING DONG STYLE BURGER is weird but everyone at my table enjoyed it (to varying degrees).  The peanut butter flavor was a bit too strong, so we countered with loads of sriracha.  But the honey slaw on top was a nice touch.    NOT QUITE FRIED TURKEY SANDWICH is not at all fried, for those who are wondering.  It's a baked turkey that has been sliced and layered on a bun with bacon, fresh basil, tomato, mayo and cheese.  Husband found it to be an acceptable healthier alternative to what the rest of us ordered (minus the cheese and mayo).    The baked PIMENTO CHEESE WAFFLE FRIES with BACON = the piece de resistance for us.  They are careful to layer the pimento cheese inside the fries so it's not just on top.  The bacon is perfectly crispy, and while this might have been the most decadent dish, it's definitely the most delicious.  Add sriracha for more amazing-ness.    I did not get the bill, so I have no idea how much the BANANA PUDDING cost, but it was too much for 4 of us to split (so whatever the cost, probably worth it).  It's messy looking, slopped into a bowl with a couple of spoons stuck into the top, and it's nothing gourmet or interesting.  But it nicely satisfied all of our sweet cravings at the end of a gluttonous meal.    Only come here if you don't care about fat or calories.  It's a cheat meal, for sure."}
{"text":"Best burger in town!!! These guys nailed it again!  When things happened and The Boys moved I was sure that we would be losing some of the best food in town. Man, was I surprised! How do you improve on The Best .... Well they did and how!   I have taken two people back to the West side to enjoy The Best Burger In Charlotte!  The other menu selections are fantastic as well.... All three of us will be back for more!"}
{"text":"All I know how to say is YUMMMM! This is one of my favorite places to go! Love their crab puppies and live for their hotdogs! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe of the place.  Great food and value.........But,    I have been here about 10 times and sat at the bar.  They have yet to say hello, ask my name, ask how I'm doing etc.   and yes, I tip 20-25%.  Wish staff had more welcoming attitude.  It ain't THAT hard!"}
{"text":"Diner food delicious eats!  We tasted the crabcake hush puppies and they were amazing, salty, savory, crunchy and delicious. There were several large crab hush puppies in the order, maybe 12-15.  I ate the ding dong chicken sandwich and it has peanut sauce and slaw. The flavors are like thai-asian chicken seasoning. The portion is generous and the seasoning tasted a little spicy but tasty.   We didn't have drinks but they had good beers listed. Parking is easier down the road in the dirt lot. We got there at 11:45 a.m. for lunch and there was no wait time."}
{"text":"This place is a must try!...We went to a Panthers game and after wanted to catch a bite...Yelp to the rescue! I had a mammoth burger that was big but not overly \"mammoth\" meat was tasty although I wasn't given the option of ordering a temp...which would have made this burger one of my faves. Wife got the pattie melt which was actually better than mine...but the Fries stole the show!. We ordered the \"pimp'n fries\" because the burger don't bring any...waffle fries with pimento cheese...ridiculous!!  We'll be back to try some more! Average prices ok service...but food makes up for the shortcomings!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was very trendy and cool. We got seated right away. We were asked if we had any questions and was sure to take our order as soon as it was ready. The food came out quick and hot! There are many different options. The coolest part Guy Fieri has been here on his show. Try it out!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I don't love it, but I do like it a lot. It's a Charlotte institution, and the food is very good. The only thing that threw me off is that the onion rings are very soft... not thick as expected. Still good."}
{"text":"I love that they are so transparent about the ingredients they use, making it easy to alter the vegetarian options into vegan ones. I had the reuben dogs which tasted great. Though I tend to make these same options at home, this is a super convenient place to be able to go to as a vegan with non-vegan friends."}
{"text":"Most folks know the Pinky's back story, so I'll let it be and concentrate on the food. Food is solid IMO. Don't expect to be wowed with inventive food that comes from the farm. Pinky's hits the nail on the head with good, cheap food!   I've had the fried pickles, regular burger, crab hush puppies (no need to get the bland regular ones) and the veggie corn dog. That's right, a veggie corn dog...and it's GOOD!   Can't wait for the return visits! Oh yeah, most definitely a PBR joint!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 4 because I like it so much: the vibe, the staff, the overall ambiance...I just wish I liked the food a little more.  The menu is basically bar food but I feel like with a little more flavor it could be so much better.  For example, the Korean BBQ tacos...just toss the meat in the BBQ sauce before putting it in the tortilla and it would make a world of difference.  I find the burgers, hot dogs, chicken sandwiches to be fairly unremarkable, so maybe with a little kick they could all be taken up a notch.  I hafta say though that the sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had.  I will continue to frequent pinky's and just hope for the best!"}
{"text":"I tried to visit this place yesterday (Sat).  Drove from Monroe to find out that Woodland Road was under construction so we drove around a few blocks.  We finally made it to the Restaurant (so we thought) coming from the other direction on Woodland.  If you are coming from Woodland and you are trying to find a parking space you maybe surprise to find out that there is about 7 parking spaces in front of Pinky's and by that time it is a little too late to make any turns because you are now facing Freedom Dr and you can only make a right, taking you away from the restaurant.  This is one of those place without a parking lot so you have to park in places nearby so make sure you look up the address in Google Maps..... location...location...location..."}
{"text":"We finally had a chance this past Sunday evening to give Pinky's a try.  Luckily, we got there before the crowd, got one of the eight parking spaces in front, and were seated immediately.    The decor inside is playful and fun.  It's a very casual place, but not in a bad way.  We were a little confused by the service because we had no less than five servers visit our table, but I guess everyone just pitches in with every table and shares the tips at the end of the night?  You've gotta really like your co-workers for that, otherwise there's bound to be some hostility if someone's not pulling their weight.  Pinky's has a large drink menu (with great regular prices), as well as more non-alcoholic choices that restaurants typically offer.    The prices are also excellent on their food menu.  Items are a la carte, but they're so affordable that you don't feel ripped off ordering them that way.  We split the Pimp'n Fries (pimento cheese melted over waffle fries) appetizer (big enough for two) for $5.95 and then each ordered a sandwich for an additional $5.  The appetizer was AMAZING.  I probably could have used more cheese, though, for the naked fries at the bottom of the pile.    I ordered the Green Chile Pork sandwich.  Having been to Santa Fe recently, I was imagining those types of spicy flavors, since Green Chile is a big thing there.  The sandwich ended up being more Hawaiian to me, though, with the pineapple on top and other sweet flavors.  No spiciness here.  It still tasted delicious, though, and was just the right size.    Everyone was super-friendly and we enjoyed the meal.  The only problem was that because everyone just pitches in, it's kind of like \"the left hand not knowing what the right is doing.\"  It took awhile for us to get our fries appetizer and then when one of the servers picked up the empty basket, she asked, \"Are you waiting on anything else?\"  Uh yeah...our actual meal.  We waited quite awhile longer (and three drink refills) before our sandwiches were finally prepared and brought to us.  Then awhile after that for our check.  Luckily, we were still able to make our movie showtime, having budgeted some additional time.    All in all, we had a great time, and would return.  It's a great casual place to hang with friends, bring the family, or even out-of-town visitors."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Pinky's from a friend.  I had the Ding Dong Style Burger. I had not had a burger with peanut butter on it before and was nervous to try. But this Thai style burger was Excellent. We also shared an order of crab puppies. They were wonderful. Don't overlook this restaurant. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a bit of a wait, but the food was really good. Service was good too. Really glad we stopped here as we passed through town."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the Pimp\"n\"Fries. Seriously I have to have a weekly fix. The hamburgers are great, hot dogs even better and to top it off... Killer banana pudding. Love playing the pinball games and always great waiters and service. You are missing out if you haven't had those fries, seriously. Pimento cheese over waffle fries hot... can't get enough."}
{"text":"With high expectations we ventured to Pinky's to satisfy a craving for burgers and fried food.  1) No one got sick  2) Service was good  3) Order was correct, no mistakes  4) Ambiance - fun!  5) Parking in a bail bonds parking lot. Thumbs up!   However, the burgers were \"meh.\" If this is a top burger in Charlotte, then I feel bad for the people of Charlotte. The burgers are a tad overcooked, but maybe that's the law.  Fried pickles - high expecations - and they were juicy, but the batter didn't add to the dish. Meh.  Crab hugh puppies - well, oddly addictive, but its like a cheap crab fried cake balls.  Waffle fries - we thought these were the best thing about our meal."}
{"text":"First time customer and will be a returning customer lol. I got the White Trash Burger and the Veggie Chilli and being a full on carnivore I didn't miss the lack of meat. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The place isn't in the best area, and has a very different menu. I thought my boyfriend was crazy for wanting to try this place. However, the food was delicious. I really like the idea that everything is a la carte. We got the pimento cheese fries for an app then had our burgers. I wish I would've gotten the chili on the fries too. Nice selection of beers as well!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They always have really good drink specials no matter what day I come in. The food is always amazing! I loooooove the chicken tacos! Sooooo good!! You must try it and the banana pudding but really you can't go wrong with anything you order. I love it and will always come back!"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and I love the atmosphere you can dine outside which is a plus I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Charlotte area or just visiting!"}
{"text":"I leave this review with a heavy heart as I know pinky's is a big deal in Charlotte. However, I have been four times hoping for a different outcome, but leaving with food poisoning every single time.   I always enjoy the food when I am there but hours later, not so much. I love burgers and I love fries and the menu looks so great and I want pinky's to be good so badly. I hear people talk and I dream about having a delicious burger but every single time, without fail, I have gotten sick. What from? I am not sure. The last time our entire table got sick so I can't be going crazy.   The restaurants appeal and staff are great so If you head that way, maybe just ask for a well cooked burger. Let me know how it goes."}
{"text":"Awesome! Sat at the bar Jeska was fabulous.  Service was fast, drinks were wet and tasty.  Order pimp-n-fries very good. Slight kick which was great most places are scared to add it. Todays special Salmon tacos YUM couldn't finish them they were a huge portion. Side of black beans wow great taste nobody does it better.  Custom margaritas...watermelon and then Malibu red so good!  WILL come back"}
{"text":"Ok so I was excited about this place opening before the whole #penguingate thing happened. However, since that did happen my first trip to Pinky's was to compare the offerings.   I got what I usually get, a burger (Pterodactyl Burger west side style in this case), half order of fried pickles, and banana pudding at the end.   Everything is just as good as I remember, all of it made even better by the free Yuengling, though I hope they get their ABC license soon just so I can have a variety to choose from. First test passed.  My second trip I wanted to try something new so I tried the fish taco. Not the best I`ve had in Charlotte but, pretty darn good. Personally I think I will stick with just ordering burgers in future, but it's always good to have choices. Second test passed, but with a slightly lower grade.  On top of the good food this place is alot closer to where I live now! I like the location, just the parking is horrible. I am not a fan of crossing freedom drive.   Overall, I like Pinky's and I will be going back for years to come."}
{"text":"Great little burger place. Relaxed atmosphere, neat decor, wonderful staff. On this particular visit we had three (not just our own) waitresses keep up with our drinks, it was pretty nice. We never went thirsty and the sweet tea was perfect. I ordered the popcorn chicken basket, and while the fries were outstanding if I'm being honest the chicken was underseasoned. I've been here a couple of times and can recommend both the burgers and the hand dipped corn dogs, the chicken just didn't do it for me. Overall I would say its definitely worth a visit to Pinky's."}
{"text":"To start this place had the best ginger Margarita i ever had. The atmosphere is fun and the servers are very nice. I liked the crab hush puppies but the food we ordered otherwise was not very good. The burger didn't have any flavor and the corn dog shrimp was a fun novelty but not a very good dinner. I'll be back for the Margarita but I'll just have an appetizer with it."}
{"text":"I Like not LOVE!!!  I came in last week and I will say this place is sooo much bigger and shinier!! They sat us right away and we entered the second dining room with the garage doors! Very cool, and yet a little too cold inside maybe the heat wasn't working all that well but still I can see the appeal to sitting here on a nice day/night out!!   We started with the Waffle fries with Pimento- Soo Good!! The fries were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of cheese on top!! I then moved on and had the Pterodactyl Burger with Cheese and Bacon- Meh it was good but the one at the Penquin was better (could've been the grease from all the years)!! I also had the Hotdog with just Sauerkraut-Good!  My Man Friend had the Buffalo Shrimp Tacos- Also Good!   The service was just like it was at the Penguin and Im glad! It wasn't like some restaurants you go to and your server really hasn't a clue as to whats going on, so I was happy that everyone felt at ease with this new place just as much as I did. I will be back soon and look forward to trying other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Skipped school many times to eat lunch here. Worth the risk and you have to try the White Trash burger!"}
{"text":"Mediocre.. some good deals, and the service completely ruins in.   Yes, let me wait while the wait staff chats... don't even think about paying your check so you can leave, because the wait staff is eating. Nobody ever checked on refilling our waters, and we had to flag someone down to get any order in. I will say that the young girl we flagged down was really friendly.  May have just been an off day, and still disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't expect much here. I've tried different things here and it's a 50/50 shot if it will be any good. Today was ok except for the moldable coleslaw"}
{"text":"Had the White Trash Burger (burger, onion rings, fried pickles & sauce) with a side of sweet potatoe fries and tall glass of sweet tea! DELICIOUS! Kinda small and could pose difficulties parking if it was a full house but the decor was chill (used to be an old mechanics shop) and beer selection seems just fine. There's a good assortment of meat-lover's and veggie-lover's grub. Sandwiches are served al a carte but really is enough even when you're super hungry. None-the-less I got some perfectly cooked sweet potatoe fries. From what I saw of the place, I wouldn't recommend it for large groups so have no more than 4 ppl in the group. Just a suggestion. Otherwise, friendly people, good food and good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"While visiting friends we were told that Pinky's was on 'Diners Drive Ins and Dives' so we decided we better try it out.  The place is pretty brightly decorated with a mix of booths and tables and a small bar.  We were quickly seated on a Sunday afternoon.  The place was pretty packed.    We ordered drinks and the pimento cheese loaded fries while looking over the menu.  There is definitely a trend on the menu.... fried everything.  I asked if several items may be grilled and was told no, turned me off a little, but I ordered a burger instead.    I'll admit the burger was one of the best burgers that I have had.  Not the 'huge' gourmet burger like would be at the trendy burger places that you see popping up everywhere but the diner/drive in style.  I had chili and slaw... it was exactly what I was hoping for!  The servers all appeared to work together, but I'm not sure this was working for this restaurant.  We waiting several times for things we had asked for and as soon as one server would come and take off to get what we needed, others would all come by?  It was odd.  We asked for the checks to be split with the other couple we were with and they were completely wrong.  We just paid and left."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant with a menu of sandwich and salads that look great for lunch or dinner.  Tried the Pasty melt and the black bean burger with sweet potato fries and onion rings. Delicious! Lots of hot dog specials listed too. Will be back to try some of those. It's worth the trip to Huntersville."}
{"text":"This funky place is not just great diner food, it's a whole experience! There is so much to look at! It's creative, offbeat and has really delicious food! The servers are so cool, lots of tatoos and personality. We've been a few times, taking friends with us, and we all had a ball! If you have an out of town friend, take them here for the funky, fun vibe."}
{"text":"Great food and great price. Service was very fast. If I had to complain about something it would be the how they serve there food.  Their serving sizes overshadow The tiny plates or baskets. Never the less good food"}
{"text":"I have waited to post a review of Pinky's to give it a fair shake.  I'm a Westside townie, so I wanted to let them work out some kinks and try some stuff before I posted.   I'm glad I did because the first couple things I ordered were not as good as expected but I persevered and found some stuff that is crave-worthy. My hubs loves the Green Chile Pork sandwich and Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich with slaw, PB and Sriracha (and the burgers).  I like the fish tacos and the shrimp tacos a lot, though I can't get the honey cilantro slaw because I'm allergic. Usually they will cut up some cabbage and throw it in for me plain, which is nice.  The fish is fried perfectly and rivals (gasp!) Cabo Fish Taco. Way better prepared than Cantina.  The Pterodactyl burger is good and juicy and definitely outdoes neighbor Burger Co's plain burger, but inversely, Pinky's turkey burger falls short and is a bit bland. There are lots of unique ways to order your burgers/dogs so I think you'll have happy taste buds.  Greg's Pickles are exactly what you'd expect.  Lots of people LOVE the crab puppies (hushpuppies with a tiny bit of crab) but we were underwhelmed. Stick w/ the pickles or other apps.  I would suggest steering clear of the falafel. The flavor was off for me- perhaps too much coriander or similar spice? I couldn't finish it.    Service is usually friendly, but food delivery is almost always slow. Don't go here if you have a tight lunch break because they are almost always slammed. Don't assume you'll get a table right away, but it's easier if it's party of 2.  Luckily I can walk, so I don't have to deal with tough parking. Within the last couple months they opened their outdoor patio, so there's even more seating under a shade sail. I think you'll find it's worth it though with some unique menu items."}
{"text":"I had high hopes after hearing that one of the former owners of the Penguin ran this restaurant, but my trip there on Sunday, 1/29/12, was incredibly disgusting and disappointing.  Our table ordered a variety of appetizers to share, included the felafel balls, Pimp'n Fries, and hushpuppies.  The felafel was tasteless and overcooked, the fries were soft and greasy, and the hushpuppies were just ok.  Nothing to brag about, but certainly the better order.   My lunch order was a Pterodactyl burger with everything.  Not a bad price, but having to pay extra for a side of fries made the price misleading.  I opted to share fries with someone else.  The burger was greasy, literally dripping with grease, and completely covered in mayonnaise.  I scraped the majority of the mayo off, but after that I couldn't get over the amount of grease.    I also had a few fried pickles, but at glancing the bottom of the container which was holding a standing level of grease, I was disgusted.  Of all the fried items, we reached a consensus that either the oil is old or was not hot enough.  Everything was soaked in oil and overcooked.  I can appreciate a good burger joint, but this was beyond terrible.  It's possible to have fried food that doesn't drip with oil.  Even the sweet potato fries were soaked in it.  I will never return.    I also had a horrible bout of food poisoning that night.  I won't be so quick to blame this particular restaurant, but it was the only thing I ate out of the ordinary that day, so make your own judgment."}
{"text":"New to Charlotte.  Came here after work one Friday for much needed drinks!  Initially, I thought the bar staff had too much attitude for my taste, but we were blessed with a super friendly server who made up for my initial reaction.  Being dairy and gluten-free, it's sometimes hard to find things to eat on the menu, but I was super excited to find potato-crusted tilapia to satisfy the fried fish craving I had been having all day.  Along with waffle fries, it felt great to participate in a booze and fried food fest.  I'm totally in love with the drink menu.  I had a delicious spicy hot ginger spiced rum concoction, and have begun a quest to try every drink on the menu.  Service was quick, and to be fair my group was pretty rowdy, and though we may have been slightly disruptive to other patrons, (sorry, people), it was never an issue.  Hoping to make this a habit :)"}
{"text":"I wish I had a better review for Pinky's. My friends love this place and will probably persecute me for down playing its appeal.  Though a fine place for a PBR in \"the scene,\" I've never left Pinky's feeling good about myself.  If you are down for a deep fried appeltizer, followed by a deep fried entree, and topping it off with a deep fried dessert, you have found your home. Make sure to get a side of butter and mayo and let the coma commense."}
{"text":"I ordered the Patty Melt and it had absolutely zero flavor. I couldn't taste it at all and I was really hungry. Usually when you're that hungry everything tastes good but not this. It didn't taste bad but it didn't taste at all! And all the wait staff have gross piercings and weird hair. The host had a huge nose ring that made him look like a cow or some other farm animal. The waffle fries were okay, and they only have waffle shaped fries, no other options. The seating inside is really cramped. You're basically shoulder to shoulder with the table next to you.  If you do go just don't get the patty melt. The banana pudding is pretty good though."}
{"text":"I travel a lot . This place was recommended to me from The bar tender at Blue Blaze Brewery. She said to get the white trash  burger .. I did .. it was great!i really don't know how they cook it so fast .. but it was fast and hot and good!"}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch with the kiddos and hubby while passing through the Charlotte area. I didn't have any expectations but was pleasantly surprised by this quirky little place.   We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken. Saw fried pickles on the menu and quickly put in an order for those bad boys. Served with homemade ranch dressing, they were very tasty. The 4 year old got the pterodactyl burger. He thought it was made of actual Dino meat and scarfed it down. Score! 2 year old got a corn dog and ate almost half which in toddler land is a win. The hubs and I both got the pinky dog. It's a hot dog smothered in homemade pimento cheese and chili. It was pretty darn tasty. For sides we had the waffle fries (standard) and the southern slaw (meh). Being 7 months preggo I did not have a chance to enjoy a cocktail though I did read longingly through the menu which featured many delish sounding drinks with fun names. Unicorn tears anyone?!?  All in all a good place with a fun and funky atmosphere.  The prices aren't too bad either."}
{"text":"Not the easiest place to find, but above average bar food with some great drink specials.  It has the feel of the other Pinky's but you don't have to drive all the way to Charlotte.  Its just nice to have a pinball machine so close to home.  Lots of good fried options.  Awesome burgers, great edamame hummus, and what has to be the best fried pickles near the lake.  All served by friendly staff.  That said, I've been cutting back on the calories recently, or at least trying to.  This place wasn't for me in that fashion.  But honestly, what bar is.  That isn't the point of this establishment.  Bottom line is, I'll be back.  Just let me shed some of my beer belly first.  Oh yeah.  Heads up, it is a bar, but they close at 10pm on week nights.  So, this isn't your late night spot."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly. Great hotdogs (Southern 500). Good music. Get the black bean side."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Pinky's and they didn't disappoint!   I ordered the veggie burger - white trash style. This is one good handmade veggie patty! Just keep in mind it's going to be a messy sandwich, but it's worth it for all that goodness.  I also sampled the waffle fries, sweet potato fries and crab puppies. They were all yummy! Especially the crab puppies! If you're on the fence about what to try...get these! I also really enjoy all the sauces that came with the food. I can't remember them all but I know they were yummy!   I see why it's a local favorite and constantly stays busy!   See ya soon Pinky's!"}
{"text":"Burgers and Waffle Fries are fantastic! We had a great waiter who was pleasant and kept our drinks full. I am so glad I finally can here! It's hard to miss with that patriotic VW beetle on the top. There is parking past it on on the right side of the road (gravel lot). You can tell the place is well loved because they were pretty busy. I can imagine most nights there is a wait to be seated, especially for larger groups."}
{"text":"I always get the white trash burger and it's awesome. The hush puppies are also great. The food service is quick but the waitresses are a little slow when bringing the check."}
{"text":"Great day drinking on a Saturday- Bartender did a wonderful strawberry lemonade margarita, fabulous! Chicken tacos were pretty fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"Y'all, Pinky's is great.   I feel it's a place that you can bring a group of folks with various tastes and everyone will leave happy! It's a place where I can get a salad and my dining companions can get a White Trash Burger.   Let's discuss this salad. I have super high salad standards and I was pleasantly surprised by what I was served. I always get the Tahini Salad. It's basically a greek salad with falafel and a tasty tahini dressing.  It is consistently good and I find myself trying to talk people into going to a diner so that I can order a salad!"}
{"text":"Cheap and tasty.   They offer a build your own burger if you don't like the preset burger choices. Pinky dog which was overflowing with chili and pimento cheese.  The sweet potato chips and fries were good.  The burgers, hot dogs, and tacos are all good."}
{"text":"Fried pickles are the best I've ever had! Love the funky menu items! Atmosphere is great"}
{"text":"It's been quite sometime since we went. I believe they may have more than 1 location?  Anyway we went to the original. Small place but lots of character. Kind of like an adult club house unique artwork. Love the adult milkshakes. Big hamburgers. A neat retro type would recommend for lunch or when you have the munchies for indulgent food."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in town, it's low key, funky and the food is delicious. It allows options for vegetarians and vegans and is kid friendly. Only thing I will point out is it is not dog friendly, as yelp has it down. They do have a patio but don't allow dogs. That is the only negative as there aren't enough dog friendly spots in the town."}
{"text":"A bottle of Maalox will greatly enhance your experience here at Pinky's.  There are better places, but this is a Charlotte staple and I would never discourage someone from going here."}
{"text":"We had a girls night out all of our first time here and atmosphere was great! The food on the other hand for instance my turkey burger was dry - both our sweet potatoe fries were cold and didn't taste good at all (no flavor). My girlfriend got a burnt corndog and our fried pickles had some type of liquid on the bottom :-0 ummm so needless to say we didn't eat them.  The banana pudding was really good tho lol Oh and no parking.   6/9/2017 UPDATE:  We went back to Pinkys this past Friday (thanks to Andy) and had a good time. Chicken Philly was good - service was fast and I do love the atmosphere sitting outside. Didn't have any dessert this time...the waffle fries were yum with wasabi ranch dipping sauce :)"}
{"text":"Cool place, the food is amazing....I love, love, love the 'ding dong chicken sandwich', the white trash burger and the pimento cheese fries. They are seriously the best fries in Charlotte. Some stuff is hit or miss, my kids got some over-fried food once, but they ate it anyway. I definitely am a fan. Can't eat here regularly or else I'd be 400 pounds, but it's good for a splurge!"}
{"text":"I'm just going to reiterate what those who have been fortunate enough to experience Pinky's have said in their reviews here:  White Trash Burger: Yes, you should get it at least once but be prepared for a gut bomb for real. (I haven't had the Ding Dong burger but have heard it's pretty dang good as well. I might be adventurous enough to try that someday... Maybe.)  Cheese fries: Yes, get those also. But again, gut bomb.  Corn dogs of any sort: Hell yeah. Get those too.  Atmosphere: Super laid back, hipster, casual and diner-ish. I went there today after not showering for 2 days and no one seemed to care. (Let the judging commence...)  Pricing: Average, affordable diner food pricing. ($22 for 2 meals and 2 soft drinks)  Service: Spot on! Did not have to ask for anything at all as our server was seriously on top of everything. Also, on our way out the door today after lunch, we were told \"Have a good one!\" and \"Thanks again!\" by several of the employees. That really goes a long way for me.  And lastly... Why are the \"Shrimp Corn Dogs\" not called \"Shrimp Puppies\"??!! It is just beyond me. It would be such a cute little name for those delicious morsels of fried battered shrimpness. It just makes sense. (Yeah, go ahead and get those too.)    **Oh! Almost forgot... park behind the building in the gravel lot or else you won't be parking anywhere."}
{"text":"Good food, interesting menu and very reasonable. Surprisingly good falafel."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Pinky's after seeing the restaurant on Diners Drive In and Dives. The Crab Balls, Fried Pickles and the Ding Dong Shrimp were very good. The table service was very good.   The turn off was the table next to us where the people had a dog sitting on their table drinking from a water glass. Not appetizing at all. And, when we were leaving we wanted to purchase a couple t-shirts. The hostess has just one party of 2 waiting for a table   She was less than helpful when it came to assisting with the purchase. Needless to say, no purchase was made.   I travel to Charlotte quite frequently, just not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Been hitting this place for a few weeks now and finally getting around to write a review. The burgers are delicious and priced well, great drink specials and selection of drinks, and sides are a la cart which I appreciate because I'd rather share a side with someone that have to stuff too much food down in one sitting."}
{"text":"Decent food for great value. Service is quick, food is good and fresh (not frozen) and all made in house and atmosphere is fun and quirky. They have a fun cocktail menu which I'll have to take advantage of after pregnancy. Love this place for a quick reliable meal. The burgers are what they are known for. But don't miss the pimento cheese waffle fries, they are so so good. Won't last long. This time we got fish tacos and the Mediterranean pita. Pita was just okay, the homemade rosemary white bean hummus was the highlight. We liked the slaw on top of the fish tacos, a fun little twist. Great and friendly service too!"}
{"text":"holy moly.   im from new orleans, the food mecca and nothing tops what i just ate. my brother chose it after seeing the 6 varieties of corndogs and i was not excited however after getting there and seeing the awesome decor and VERY extensive menu (for both food and drinks) i got very excited. i got the chicken tacos and pimp'n fries. one word. amazing.   the lime was a very strong flavor and there was a lot of lettuce but it was so juicy and refreshing!! the fries were just incredible and im a french fry connoisseur so coming from me that's a big compliment.   the chili dog and corndog shrimp were also very good.   our server was wonderful and so was the entire experience. sad to be leaving charlotte behind purely for pinky's."}
{"text":"There's something to be said for the lost art of great service. I say I found my brush at Pinkey's.  I give 3 stars for the food, 4 for service. Had the white trash burger, good. But soggy bun that couldn't hold up the ingredients. The hummus appetizer was great, soft pillowy pita bread. My grandson had the banana pudding. It was made w/cool whip & tasty. We'll be back as the oldest granddaughter lives here w/her Mother. Oh & she's my daughter, too!"}
{"text":"First time here and loved it.  So many things I want to try on the menu,  we will definitely be back. But the fish tacos and mojitos were spot on!!!"}
{"text":"When I want to grub some good old American fare (and when I get a hankering for a hot dog) this is where I go. White trash style is the only style. Drinks are good and fried pickles can't be stopped from going in my belly. Good service. Their falafel is pretty delish as well."}
{"text":"It's such a local establishment; I had high hopes. But I just wasn't impressed with my food. It was diner-style food. That's about it."}
{"text":"Came here with the fiance for the first time in many years.  Our waitress came by and took our shortly after we were seated.  While taking our order, I began to request that we get fried pickles instead of onion rings as one of our side.  Before I could finish explaining I wanted a substitution the waitress just walked off.  Shortly after, my fiance finished her drink.  We waited for our waitress, but did not see her at all inside the restaurant for close to ten minutes, another waitress (of the table next to us) noticed her empty cup and filled it up.  Later, another waitress dropped off our food, and as I expected, we received two sides of onion rings and fried pickles rather than just one order of onion rings and fried pickles since our waitress didn't let me finish placing my order.  My burger did not have any cheese on it, so I decided to wait and ask our waitress for a slice of cheese from the kitchen. She never came by, I had to wave down another waitress, who ended up being nice and helpful.  The fried pickles were indeed still good, however, both my fiance and I agreed that the burgers were not good.  They had the texture and look of burgers that had been kept in a steam warmer or container of beef brother, there was not any searing from griddle or chargrilling. It was not what I remembered of Pinky's years ago (or the Penguin for that matter).  Neither of us could finish our burgers due to the odd texture or lack of apparent grilling / cooking so we decided to get the bill.  Again we could not find our waitress, so I asked the other waitress that helped us out earlier for the bill. Then for the first time since we were seated, our waitress came by and snagged the bill with my credit card.  Overall, the service was bad and the burgers were no good, don't see us coming back again."}
{"text":"After growing up going to the penguin with me and my dad when I was little  , I was so sad when the guys left. But so happy they opened Pinkys . Even though I now live in Oregon. Every time I come to town, It's the place we go. Their fried pickles and the pimiento chili dog is the best! Always going to be my favorite ."}
{"text":"Husband took me here for the first time yesterday. He had eaten here numerous times and was excited to take me there. It was a Sunday afternoon.not terribly busy. Our food took a long time to come out. When it did two of the three things we ordered were ice cold. We had to go look for someone to get to fix this because no one ever came back to check on us. They did remake our food which was then good. When wr were done again no server. We wound up having to go walk up to the bar to pay our bill. Ridiculous. Service was horrible."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger joint in Charlotte.  I used to hit up the Penguin practically every week before it closed (and then reopened under new mgmt).  The guy who use to run the kitchen at Penguin when it was on 'Diners, Drive Ins & Dives' owns this place, so there are some similarities.  The menu is much more diverse though.  They DO have healthier options.  My girlfriend and I were turned on to the Kinda Fried Turkey sandwich by the bartender one night.  We never really considered it because I just never felt compelled to order a turkey sandwich at a place known for burgers.  Boy, did my opinion change quickly.  That sandwich is amazing.  The meat is so juicy, it's pure bliss.  She usually orders that and I always get the burger, westside style (chili, coleslaw, mustard) and add pimiento cheese and bacon.  BEST BURGER EVER.  The chili, cheddar, and pimiento cheese waffle fries are also one of our favorites.  Pair all of this up with a tall boy of Genesee cream ale and you're set.  We can usually get out of Pinky's with a meal and drinks for 2 around $30.  In other words, a steal."}
{"text":"Noisy, lively, rambunctious, divey, eclectic atmosphere. From the servers, to the crowd--you never know what you're gunna get.   I live and work about a mile a way and frequent Pinky's. Very diverse menu from salads, to dogs, to tacos, and burgers. You can be as healthy or unhealthy as you want and trust it will be a good meal. Decent prices, but they are one of those places that charge you for everything...Fries? That'll be extra. Toppings? That'll be extra. You get the point.  Parking is kind of a pain, but there are lots across the street and adjacent. This place gets busy during peak hours so expect a wait. They also have great food and drink specials daily.  Ding dong sandwich is sort of a \"pad thai\" take on a chicken sandwich, different and pretty good...I'd recommend it if that;s your kind of thing. The turkey burgers are impressive for this type of joint. Fish tacos, fresh and delicious.  The downside... service is a little odd. It's an \"everyone is your server\" type of place which makes it confusing and a bit awkward."}
{"text":"The white trash burger and waffle fries were pretty good. They didn't have blue moon but the bartender made a great recommendation for something similar. The food took a while to come out but it was goood! And it costs 5.50 for a burger and 2.50 for waffle fries. That's not bad at all!!! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Just sat down place is eclectic. .I like the Vibe...parking sucks but I live close enough to walk ( being lazy)..Food looks amazing...scrumptious burgers passing by trying to order but everything looks good....wings just pass by smells good..10min to bring our food....I got the white trash and da pimp....burger smaller than I thought but still a great value...the da pimp was da bomb....I'll be back here fa sho!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and plenty of options to choose from whether you're looking for that classic dive meal or something more quirky. I have been many, many times and never been disappointed. Heads up on take-out orders, though. There have been a few times where items were missing...so just make sure to check your bag."}
{"text":"All hype and no substance. From the people that brought you the Penguin - another overrated establishment -comes another pseudo- east village hangout for biker wanna be's. Food is uneventful. Here' it's all about saying you were there. Has a seating capacity of about 4 in the entire place.Good luck trying to find a seat at lunchtime or weekends. The Neighborhood is what they call Wesley Heights. I call it the seedy edge of uptown. Save your money and check out Dish in Plaza Midwood,"}
{"text":"They push themselves as a place with vegan options, yet anything marked with a \"V\" on the menu is vegetarian and not vegan-friendly. Please make a clear indication as to which dishes are vegan-friendly or create more vegan options. My visit was extremely stressful because of this and I've been apprehensive about returning."}
{"text":"Last night I went here for the first time and was not disappointed. The menu is great if you want cheap eats. It was very affordable  yummy bar food. There are also great vegetarian options. It is a very fun environment with a lot of decor to Look at. The pimpn fries were great and so were the burgers. Also had a good pita with cheese spinach basil etc forget the name but it was great. Drink specials as well. I want to get the white trash burger and fried pickles next time as I've heard great things. Highly recommend! Especially if you're on a budget but are tired of fast food. Good food at fast food prices"}

{"text":"My husband went here last year with some coworkers because he saw it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives, and made me go with him this time. It definitely lives up to its hype! We started with the Pimpin Fries, waffle fries much like Chick Fila's with homemade pimento cheese melted on top. My hubby doesn't even like pimento cheese and was raving about them. He got a Mammoth burger (double) and couldn't finish it all, it was huge! I had the Ding Dong Chicken sandwich at the suggestion of our server who said nothing on the menu was as good as it. Chicken breast, some yummy sweet cole slaw, siracha, and crunchy peanut butter made for a delicious sandwich. Whoever thought of putting peanut butter on a chicken sandwich is genius! My daughter had the basic chicken sandwich ad said it was good. We all topped the stay off with a single bowl of banana pudding, which was excellent and fed all three of us. I will definitely make this a regular in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This place gets packed for lunch! Good food with even better prices. They have a variety of salad's for all you 'healthy' types. Myself ... I prefer their white-trash burger. With a name like that ... you know it's going to be glorious, and that it is. Service is pretty quick.  Also a good place to come with friends late night to hang out with a beer/cocktail if you don't want to go to a loud/overcrowded bar."}
{"text":"So I asked my fiancé to pick me up my fav salad, (Popcorn Chicken Salad), from Pinky's. As I was eating it,I noticed that it didn't taste the same and wasn't as good. The last time couple of times  I had it they used, fresh Romaine lettuce and had fresh onions and fresh chicken. This time they used a soggy Spring mix lettuce (which I hate) and it only had one piece of onion that wasn't fresh. Being that I was hungry, I decided to keep eating it, only to chew on something that scratched my tongue. I spit it out and it was a piece of friggin plastic. I'm so livid right now. Although Pinky's has been one of my favs, I don't think I will be able to go back because of this. Not sure if they have new cooks and or staff but that is totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have a Pinky's open in Huntersville!  This one lives up to my high expectations - just like the one on the westside. This is an eclectic burger joint. Expect to see tattoos, piercings and funky hair!  That's what makes Pinky's Pinky's! I love how they put twists on the normal bar food. If I had to narrow down my favorites I would pick the Ding Dong Chicken, Pimpin Fries (add bacon!!) and the sweet potato chips with wasabi ranch are amazing! I honestly haven't had anything I didn't like!"}
{"text":"We love Pinkys!  Variety of items on their menu.  Great taste, friendly staff, always very helpful too.  Try the kicker chicken tacos.  You will not be disappointed!  Dont forget to try the banana pudding.  1 serving is enough for the entire table!!  Great cold beverages too!  Lots of vegetarian options too.  Hummus and pita toast.  Pimpin' fries, ding dog style a burger too."}
{"text":"The fish sandwich, shrimp corn dogs and hamburgers along with sweet potato fries are delicious. The staff is very friendly.  Great atmosphere were lots of seating available."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the Jive Turkey ( Turkey burger) We come here pretty regularly and thought the tasteless Turkey burgers on last visit was a fluke. Wrong!  We tried them again and they had not a lick of salt/ seasoning on them.What happened???? Boo on Pinky' s. Please tell the cook (s) that poultry lacks much fat and NEEDS  seasoning. Really enjoy crab puppies, beef burgers, cocktails and salads...but need them to get that bird right!"}
{"text":"Our go to spot! Friendly, efficient staff. Food is always cooked to order. The almost fried turkey sandwich and ding dong sand which are a must try!  My only complaint would be to receive the check a bit quicker."}
{"text":"Came for my birthday today! (3/17/17) the wait wasn't long, food is great!!!! Service is the best!! I will be a regular!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but service could be a little better. I had about 3 different servers during my meal there, it was weird."}
{"text":"I've been to Pinkys several times in the last few months. Honestly, it's been due to the recent PenguinGate of Charlotte. However, I will write this review not as a comparison but as an honest review. First, the service is very quick and the food delivers. The fried pickles are very delicious as are the burgers. The fried Chicken sandwich is also very good. I really like the fact that they have waffle fries but they do come with a little Cajun seasoning that I feel isn't enough. I wouldn't have even noticed it was there until I actually saw it. Their jukebox needs some work as it contains mostly mid to late 90's music. It's a great place to stop in for a good greasy meal but the decor is a bit flashy for me and lacks that certain down home dive restaurant feel that makes you want to linger ( I'm sure the music also plays a part).  I say that if you find that you are lacking a good burger and fried pickles then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I went in on the Memorial Day Weekend after seeing this restaurant on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.   I was torn between the White Trash burger and the Corn Dog shrimp, but ended up getting the burger with a side of fries. Honestly, I thought the burger was average, but it was tasty. Next time, I'll try the shrimp.   What I did thought was exceptional was the attentive service I received from the entire staff.   Also, they have great drink specials. On Saturday's, any cocktail that has Absolut vodka in it is only $5. I settled on the Wedding Punch and it was delicious.  I would recommend parking in the back, just keep driving past the entrance and you'll see the lot for parking.  I saw a yelper complaining about the walk, but it's nothing to worry about.   Overall, it's a fun place with a funky vibe. I'll be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, great burger and sides, very friendly service, uplifting atmosphere, Nothing bad to say about this Charlotte gem. Recommended for any occasion, lunch, weekend out with the friends or family. The food is excellent, definitely a must try for anyone."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Really neat atmosphere, and they have a diverse menu to please the pickiest of eaters. I got the tahini salad; everything in the salad was fresh and they give you a good portion of food. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Pinky's is usually full and usually a little loud. For me, these are signs of a place worth visiting as it indicates people having a good time.   The food is good, lots of options for many types of eaters  (vegetarian included). I have enjoyed multiple meals here both indoors and outdoors and at differing times of day/night - the food has always been consistently good and the service adequate or better.  It's worth checking out for sure, and there's easy to locate extra parking on both sides of the building  in gravel lots if their front lot is full (trust me, it will be)."}
{"text":"So I went to PWG with high hopes due to the average 4 star rating out of 5. While the experience was good, it unfortunately didn't merit the enthusiasm I felt going in.   What I liked:  - Prices. The majority of the entrees are at a $7-9 range and they are generous with portion sizes. - Atmosphere. It is laid back and comfortable. They play rock music in the background and the vibe is completely unpretentious.  - Indoor & Outdoor seating is available. If my friend didn't have such bad allergies I would've asked for a patio table.   What I didn't like:  - The waitress was very unknowledgeable about veganism. I mean they are one of the few Charlotte restaurants that actually offer a decent vegetarian and vegan selection so for her not to answer basic vegan questions on the food was a bit poor reflection on the restaurant.  - The quality of the food was mediocre. I asked for the white bean & rosemary hummus for an appetizer and it was just alright. My entree was the nature boy burger and it was on the bland side. It could be salvaged with different condiments though, it just lacked some kick.  - They messed up on a bill for two. We asked for the check to be split and specified twice to our waitress on who to bill what. She came back in minutes and gave us incorrect checks. Fortunately a manager was close by and fixed it for us very quickly.   Overall, I would go back here and give it another try. My friend had the falafel wrap sandwich and said it was really good. He also liked his basked of waffle fries. From the looks of his wrap, it did look pretty tasty. I think PWG has some pretty loyal locals so I doubt my review will make a dent in their business but thought I would share my two cents anyway."}
{"text":"Average spot.   This place is very cool, they did a great job creating a look and feel. As for the food, it is average. If you lived close, it would definitely be in the rotation, because it is a nice place.   Warning! If you are visiting and you have limited meals to try great food, this is not the place. Do not waste a meal here. The burger is nothing special, the taste of the actual patty is blend. The Chili Chese Fries are good, but nothing to write home about. Again, this place is not great, I would not recommend for an out of towner."}
{"text":"Improving every time I come! I think Pinky's found its vibe in Huntersville. Even the food is tasting better these days! Kids eat free on Mondays. Solid beer selection. Good music (though perhaps a little loud) and a few TVs sprinkled throughout airing all kinds of good things, from NASCAR to Food Network. Prices are fair for what you're getting. Parking is always easy!"}
{"text":"I have been back a couple of times since my first review, and I can say so far I have been very pleased with my food. The falafel is great, the ding dong chicken is tasty, the West Side Randy with Grilled Chicken is really delish!!  I have also now tried the onion rings and the crab hush puppies.   Honestly, all of my entrees have been outstanding, but the sides were not quite at the same level.  The onion rings were freshly made, but not the most delicious onion rings I have ever had. (A little too skinny & stringy for my preference.)   The crab puppies were just a tiny bit disappointing - I had really high hopes for them, but on my visit, they were just a bit on the bland side and didn't have much crab in them. (I might give them another try on another visit in case it was just an off day.)  On my last couple of visits, I had really good service and was overall very pleased with Pinky's. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"If you like greasy food.  This is your place.   We came around lunch and had to wait some for a table."}
{"text":"An awesome place and would highly recommend anyone to stop in and grab some grub and a cold one"}
{"text":"Went to pinky's with the family after reading some great reviews and reading what they had in the menu.   My family made it to the restaurant first and already was seated when we arrived. We came in sat down and just a short time later we were greeted and had our drink orders were taken.   We initially ordered the crab puppies and Greg's fried pickles. Those came out and the pickles were just ok but the crab puppies were awesome!!! For our main meal I ordered the mammoth burger with everything. A short time later it arrived and it was truly mammoth! See attached picture.   Beer selection was good. I would have liked to see some more IPA's but what they had was ok.   Overall I gave Pinky's 5 stars for the overall atmosphere, food, and drinks. Parking is ok just have to walk around the front, which was needed after eating all that food.  We will definitely go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"No flavor at all! I should have gotten sharp cheddar instead of going along with the provolone on the white trash burger. The meat was dry as well. I liked the waffle fries with pimento cheese but my girlfriend didn't. Oh yeah, the \"crab\" puppies (hush puppies with crab) had a minimalist amount of crab in them. It was basically all dough. Servers were friendly & attentive but we seemed to have 4 of them & they kept asking us if we were ok. All in all, we probably aren't coming back. Not enough flavor, sorry."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The little twist like the corn dog shrimp, and White Trash burger are my favorites"}
{"text":"I didn't even know Charlotte had a Westside. YeAH, WESTSIDE!! in my best gangsta voice. Pinky's is heading for success, it already has a comfortable feel, I can't believe they have only been open for a week, already feels established.   I sat at the bar waiting for friends and this nice guy beside me shared his pimento cheese, seasoned waffle fries. He has a friend for life now. Sharing is caring. Guess what?  They passed my french fry barometer. Need I say more?  My hot dog was delish, I tried a bite of a corndog- soooooooo good. The outer heavenly shell was sweet, light and a little bit of crunch. Corndogs are sent from heaven. Pinky's had a nice mix of customers, single fun drinkers, the child slingers and nice men who sit at bars and share their food with the ladies. P.S. I told him to start Yelping.  Our check average was $13 without tip -food and adult beverage. I think that is flippin' fantastic.  I can see we are heading for a beautiful relationship.  Crush factor: Orange"}
{"text":"I have to say that this was a great stop in an area I was about to give up on. The food was excellent! The portions were more than enough but watch out for desert, they've got grams outback making her famous pudding. Not kidding it tasted just like I remember from my childhood and the portion was out of this world. I could have fed a table of 4 on my portion alone.   Most importantly the waitstaff was off the chart. The place was packed yet every time I looked up from the table there was a friendly smile just checking up on how things were. Not in the overbearing way when you know they're pushing a table to get the next group in but actually caring about you. Five stars is a first for me. I will return here."}
{"text":"Great little place, and if you haven't been there, you have to go.  Eclectic staff, fun and friendly.  The food is very good, well priced and fast.  Our waitress was very engaging, made recommendations and definitely wanted us to have a good time.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Pinky's gets 4 stars from me because the food is decent, I love the atmosphere, and they have some pretty good vegan options. I don't believe they have the vegan options designated on the regular menu, but make sure to ask for the secret vegan menu. I had been to Pinky's several times before and then finally on one occasion my waiter realized I was ordering all vegan food so he brought this magical vegan menu from the kitchen that included tofu meals that aren't on the regular menu. The tofu concoction I had that day was delicious. Their chili is also amazing (and vegan) and has a good kick to it. This place gets packed right at noon so be prepared to wait in line. They have some good beers to choose from and I love their outdoor/indoor patio. Overall a solid place to hang out and grab a bite."}
{"text":"Live the atmosphere. The food was great. Jeff had the Pinky dog and needed a knife and fork to eat it. I had the Pasty burger and it was delicious! We also shared the fried pickles and they were excellent. Service was exceptional. My drink never got half empty. Really like this place. We be returning!"}
{"text":"The vegan corn dog + hot sauce is pretty good - I couldn't finish the entire dog it was quite large! The falafels are not bad either but would've rather had tried some banana pudding which was highly recommended! I took this to go but the ambience of the restaurant seemed pretty cool - next time I'll go enjoy the environment! Service was kind and quick which I liked."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Pink. This is my local neighborhood haunt... but it also has great food, great drinks, and the prices are extremely reasonable. Also, their food is prepared fresh daily ... a little known fact but very evident in the food. Where else can you go and get a great burger and a beer for $7?"}
{"text":"I had a near perfect experience at Pinky's. The service was exceptional, and all of the waiters and waitresses worked great together. Also, the food was some of the best food I've ever had in my life, and the prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This rating was based off of one persons customer service. After being seated and given my water the waitress didn't come back for over 10 mins. She was a white girl with black hair and a bunch of tattoos. Once you go to this place and see how small it is you would fill my pain and it was on a Tuesday night so it wasn't that busy. After seeing the look on my face that I was getting pissed one of the other waitresses came and took my order and it was all good after that. I would've gave them a better rating if it wasn't for the first girl. I had the corn dog shrimp with waffle fries and it was bangin. I didn't like the Cole slaw and I had got tap water to drink but that didn't taste good either so I will get bottled water or juice the next time."}
{"text":"What a strange place!  Great service. Strange menu. Great decor. Laid back atmosphere. The white trash burger is Excellent!  Definitely coming back soon"}
{"text":"Love this place! Hummus is excellent and burgers and dogs are yummy! Cool, eclectic staff. Parking all around, but maybe a block walk at worst. Drinks are made in house and are really good."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about this place, we stopped there for lunch. My hubby and son liked it, I was not impressed. Nothing wowed me about this place!"}
{"text":"Had the WhiteTrash Burger with Tots. Order of Wings Barbalo Style.  Great food and will certainly be going back to try a lot more.   Will update with new dishes."}
{"text":"Like Jules, I'm glad I waited to give a review for Pinky's.  My boyfriend & I had gotten take out, I'd say early last year & I got some kind of burger and the slaw.  I was not happy at all. I ended up feeling sick on my stomach afterwards.    Fast forward to yesterday, when I was in an extreme rush, hurrying from one appointment to another.  It was after 1 PM & the lunch rush had died down, thank goodness. I needed the order to go & was immediately helped by a friendly waitress. Like Dion alluded to, the decor inside is fun & hip, & they had some jamming music playing.  Everything looked clean.  I got the Pterodactyl burger with \"everything\" - mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion, & pickles, along with the (waffle) french fries & a sprite. Luckily, my food came out in about five minutes & I was on my way.  I nommed away on my fries along Morehead and onto South Blvd. They were tasty! They were lightly salted & light - they weren't heavy like Chic-Fil-a's waffle fries.  Once I got to my second appointment, I dove into my hamburger. OH M GEE, it was delicious! It didn't seem heavy either! The toppings were fresh & thankfully, the onion wasn't too overpowering. The burger was juicy & cooked to perfection.  The cons: parking is limited on site. You're probably going to end up parking across the street where the tattoo parlor is - & even there, parking isn't great.  The restaurant  itself isn't too big either, so seating could be an issue. Ha! I have to agree with Jimmy - this IS NOT the place for the health concious!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe. Gets busy for lunch. The food is good. I would eat here more if they had healthier items."}
{"text":"Great food awesome service ask for daisy she's a gem"}
{"text":"Was in the area and wanted to try something new and different, and heard that triple D had come to this place and so had to give them a try out. One thing that was really confusing was the amount of different waitresses coming up to our table taking our drink order to food. Was told that they work as a team, yet when it came time to where we where ready to leave not one came up to the table.  The food was really good the crab hush puppies where out of this world, and so where the corndog shrimp."}
{"text":"Can't believe it took me this long to make it into Pinky's! The crown jewel of biker bar/dive bars on the west side of Charlotte. Packed full of personalities, tattoos, the beer flows like wine, and tons of cardiac inducing treasures to be had.   The small parking lot directly in front of the restaurant can be a bit wonky. Especially if traffic is bad. There is additional parking across the street, so keep that in mind.   I'm a huge proponent of a great greasy burger, baskets o' fries, and an ice cold PBR. Pinky's delivered on multiple fronts and the 5 stars goes to show for a slew of positives.   Vegetarian options. Holy crap, this place has it all. Veggie chili, veggie burgers, dogs....They know how to make it on the map with Charlotte's veggie pride. I was blown away by Ding Dong style. Peanut butter (crunchy), sriracha and honey-cilantro slaw? Might as well be a bulls eye. The textures and flavors make it into a faux Indian/Thai wonderland of flavor. Each bite was better than the last.   Pimp'n Fries. Whoa. You can customize these in so many ways. The ubiquitous pimento cheese reigns supreme on these bad boys. Pimpin my taste buds like it's their job.   White Trash Burger. Duuuuude. Onion rings on a burger? Sign me up. Messy, greasy, piping hot and perfect rep for the dive bar world. I'm going for the double next time.   Tons of goofy stuff on the walls, awesome booths for two, plenty of space and a vast menu of dive-y greatness. What more could a hipster ask for?"}
{"text":"Very good, greasy, totally only eat once a month food!!!  Everything is fried!  Highly recommend the white trash burger (fried pickle, fried onions, cheese, burger) and their sweet potato fries which are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Their white trash burger is to die for. I went because a friend suggested it and i am truly happy i gave it a chance."}
{"text":"Having lived in Charlotte for a little over a year now, this was a place my husband and I had been wanting to visit. We are amateur burger connoisseurs, and we have heard great things about Pinky's, so, needless to say, we were pretty pumped for some Pinky's! We went on a Saturday night, so it was kind of busy. This does not bode well for customers because their parking lot holds approximately 8 cars (give or take a few). We lucked out and got a spot, but it was a hot mess when we were trying to leave! Next, the ambiance. The staff is very friendly, and the establishment itself is fun. It had that diner feel (I think it is a converted garage??), but while some diners can be antiquated and kind of dirty, this one was trendy and almost \"hipsterish\".   I am an avid hot-dog fan (trashy, I know), and the Pinky Dog looked MIGHTY yummy, but I was feeling a burger this evening. I ordered the White Trash Burger (burger patty with fried onion rings, fried pickles, and spicy ranch) because it is so highly regarded by fellow yelpers, and my husband got a mammoth burger \"Ding-Dong Style\" (includes crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro coleslaw, and Siracha hot sauce). We also split the Pimp Fries (waffle fries smothered with homemade pimento cheese and bacon). They looked like they had some really good cocktails, but we weren't there for drinks, so perhaps another time (and I will get that hot dog!).  The verdict: it was OKAY. My burger itself was not very good and a little over cooked (we were not given a cook-to-order option). The fried pickles and onion rings were good (how can you go wrong with fried food?), but there could have definitely been a little more spicy ranch on it; I couldn't really taste it at all. My husband's burger was about the same. The burger itself did not impress, but the toppings were unique and pretty good. He also felt that they skimped a bit on the Siracha. The fries, however, were the star of the meal. Their homemade pimento cheese is pretty delicious. I could probably have just eaten that with a spoon and been satisfied (remember what I said about being trashy?).  Thus, there are way better burgers in Charlotte, so I will not be going back for those, but there were some redeeming things that might have me paying them another visit in the future."}
{"text":"The veggie chili is not as good as it used to be and the parking is scary but that's only worth a one star dock.  Where this place REALLY makes up for it is the service, fantastic staff and the banana pudding.  Do NOT leave this place w/o ordering the banana pudding.  Also the menu is pretty unique overall    I didn't realize a coupon I had was for the Huntersville location but they had no problems honoring it! :)"}
{"text":"Pinky's has far and away redeemed themselves for any early inconsistency issues. Over the last several trips I have gotten a delicious, quality burger every time. The crab puppies are still absolutely amazing and the draft beer selection is above par. I returned on a Saturday again and either their crowds have died down or their super quick service has managed them since there was no longer a 2 hour wair, we were seated right away. They have come away a clear winner and a fixture on my rotating cravings list."}
{"text":"My tuna melt was no \"melt.\" It didn't exactly get served cold,  but it for sure was not warm.  A tuna melt should be served steamy and melted!  My husband didn't have any complaints about his fish tacos and I thought they were okay.  This is not a restaurant that I'll seek out to feed a craving. I didn't find it anything to write home about."}
{"text":"I reviewed the other location when it was younger than this location is now.  And of course I LOVED it.    I was nervous-ish about the other reviews on this site, until I realized where they were coming from...people in Huntersville kind of aren't ready for a restaurant like this.  If you want a place to bring your screaming children after soccer practice, and also want your food served on china, this isn't the place for you.  It says right on the menu, 'low brow food and drinks'!  Pinky's Huntersville, PLEASE don't change your 'paper basket' serving style.  It's what gives the place its charm.    The food was perfect.  I got the pterodactyl burger with cheese.  I modified it by putting fried pickles on.  Normally I put my burger down between bites to have some of my side, but I could NOT put this one down.  The quality of food definitely doesn't vary between locations, which is a huge plus.  For my side, I skipped the fries and got the fried squash.  Heavenly.  Hea-ven-ly.  Crisp but still soft on the inside, just like fried squash should be.  Fried pickles were on point, of course.  (Don't forget to try them with honey mustard!!)  The 'team service' was what I was mostly worried about, but I needn't have worried.  A girl came by to take our drink and appetizer orders.  A perfect amount of time later, a girl came by to take our food orders.  Another girl brought our food, took our to-go order of fries and pickles (for my parents at home), and our check and food came out promptly after that.  Maybe service has been bad on other days, but our waters were filled and our tummies happy.  I had no complaints on that score, or any score.  (Except that the weather was terrible but that's someone else's fault entirely.)  Also, $30 for 2 orders of pickles, two sides, and two entrees?  It's a steal for food this delicious, that you don't have to drive all the way to downtown Charlotte to get.    Even the music was awesome!    It was pretty full when we went, which is good.  I hope this location lasts and isn't edged out by its location in suburbia and people not understanding the point.  As for the person calling the food 'Penguin wannabe'.....well....do your research.    Eat at Pinky's!"}
{"text":"We went here 2 weeks ago because we heard it was run by the same guys that Penguin kicked out... and we were super disappointed. Lets start with the \"must have\" crab hushpuppies... they were pretty burned and not all the great (even though the tarter sauce served with it was pretty great it couldn't save them) but at this point i didn't say anything.   My husband and I got our burgers and as I went to take my first bite noticed a huge nasty hair on my burger... GROSS!! our never present waitress couldn't be found (again) so the bartender saw me looking for someone and screamed across the bar @ me \"what's up\"? not wanting to scream back the problem she finally came over and saw why i wasn't happy. She said she would get me another burger immediately and left. so as i sit i go to snack on our fries... and they were hard as bricks... not crispy or slightly done my oil soaked old fries. gross again. by this time i was pretty ticked but still being nice. 20 minutes later another server flings a burger on the table at me and walks away... except it wasn't what i ordered!!! my husband said his burger was pretty dry and not that great too. by the time someone comes by again i tell them its not what i wanted, the girl picks up my burger goes to the bartender and they ensue on arguing about how i didn't know what I was talking about and what i did/ did not order in front of the whole bar, why they just didn't check the ticket was beyond me.  i ordered a simple burger!  By the time the girl came back over i told her to forget about it and we just wanted our check. she took off the hush puppies because of everything (which i totally appreciated) and boxed up the \"replacement\" burger and we left asap. Not impressed especially for all the raves!! we drove in from out of town and would have rather gone across the street to the other burger joint. Def won't go back. burgers were half ass and not worth the time."}
{"text":"It is close to our area so we decided to check it out. We're not picky and we've had plenty of bar food experiences. Their drink menu had a couple of ginger-flavored options which sounded delicious. I was sick at the time so I wasn't able to try one but they did sound appealing. Ambience and theme was good, nothing special. Never knew who our server was though. Just seemed like a bunch of young girls running around who didn't know what to do. Food was awful. Practically everything is fried, fried, and fried. Not a tasty fried either. The ''breading'' crumbled off everything we ordered. Flavor was disgusting. We were definitely disappointed. We were hoping to find a place closeby with some good grub and service but Pinky's definitely didn't offer  that. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I like to go to Pinky's when I'm craving quality bar food. Very cool, funky atmosphere and fast-paced good services. Check out the drink specials too. As a vegetarian, I can find good food to eat here. The hush puppies are awesome!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have been to several places now that have been featured on some sort of TV show and Pinky's is one of the few that did not disappoint. Most featured eateries I have been to are lack luster. Pinky's is fun, colorful, and so so yummy. If you're calorie conscious, give that up for one night, it will be worth it. Pinky's not only has a variety of delicious burgers, but they have amazing drinks. Their drinks have fun clever names, like Unicorn Tears. I have had their veggie burger and their meat options, and I wish I had a second stomach so I could eat more. They also have scrumptious sides and an addicting was ranch to dip things in. I always say I am going to order their banana pudding for dessert, but I stuff myself on the other yummies beforehand and fill myself up. One day, it will happen. I don't just recommend Pinky's, I say it is a MUST try."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and affordable even Guy from food network has been. You will definitely love the fun names of their burgers and try pimento cheese on everything lol and the banana pudding is huge. Great place. Great food!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. I do feel that the hamburgers could use a little more taste of flavor to them but all in all I like them. The waffle fries are good and I think more places should serve them with their burgers."}
{"text":"Awesome place for vegans too! I got the falafel wrap and it was delicious. Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Love the decor.  The awesome color-changing specials board behind the bar is fun to look at, and my friend and I were seated immediately at the bar in the middle of the afternoon, past people who were also there in 2's but who apparently had something against immediate gratification.  Oh well, all the better for us!    Since I love anything with crab in it, we ordered the crab hush puppies.  They came piping hot, with tasty, tangy remoulade sauce accompanying.  After my friend and I had each tried one, our food came immediately...pretty much turning them into another side.  The waitress did apologize, saying that sometimes they came out early and sometimes it all came out at the same time.  Well, ok.  That's not really how the appetizer/entree system works, but they're in early days and CRAB HUSH PUPPIES HOW COULD I EVER BE MAD???  They were delicious, decadent and rich.    I also had the embarrassingly named 'Da Pimp' sandwich, which was my first ever time eating pimento cheese (I'm a terrible southerner, sorry guys!) and it was alright.  I guess I'm just not crazy about pimento cheese.  But, but, but, BUT!  As my side I ordered the beer battered fried squash, and, you guys.  They were.  So good.  Not totally smothered in batter, just a light, yet crispy coating, which allowed the squash flavor to shine along with the delicious crispiness.    It was only my first visit but I'll definitely be back.  I have to see how the burgers are and of course the fried pickles.  As far as the whole this vs. the Penguin thing, I intentionally didn't order anything that was the same from both menus, and what I had was delish.  So I suggest going there with no preconceived notions in your head and just enjoy good food and good beer.  (p.s. park across the street by the head shop...it is decidedly very penguin-esque in it's parking situation...)"}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte less then two weeks ago, and Pinky's is just down the road from my new office so I figured I had to try it. LOVE IT! Very good and fun dishes with very fast and friendly service. I will def be going back here!"}
{"text":"Food was great but the service was a little non existent.  After we ordered our waitress disappeared, we had to flag down other servers for drink refills and for our check. She brought the check and didn't say anything just walked away. Hopefully an off day."}
{"text":"My child loves going here because of the games and she can be bought with a decent hot dog, but I have yet to order the right thing. Fun environment, friendly service, good music, but I have yet to be wowed by anything I've ordered. I do love a good patio which Pinky's does offer."}
{"text":"I love this place and the team work all the servers do to help one another can't  wait to eat here again"}
{"text":"When I first wrote my review it was Pinky's opening week, and I mentioned that in time I thought they'd earn a fifth star. A year & a half and many visits later, they've certainly earned it.  My favorite items are the kinda fried turkey or tahini salads, and of course the Pterodactyl Burger Ding Dong Style with a side of waffle fries.   Ask Sara the bartender to make you Unicorn Tears. It's delicious, it's surprisingly girly looking but make sure you have the time to sleep it off the next day because you won't order only one."}
{"text":"Headache from the loud music.  Don't go there unless you expect to get a buzz on. White trash burger so-so, in my opinion. Service was great, but I prefer more traditional food."}
{"text":"I'm in a different state every few days for work and stumbled upon this spot. Absolutely delicious food, quick service, and exceptional hospitality. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Their fries and crab puppies are the best. Love the koolaid sour. We always stop by when we're in town."}
{"text":"Greg's Fried Pickles. Pimpin Fries. Westside Burger.  Yummmm.  Next time will be the schrimpz.  Love this place as it reminds me of college days parking in the gravel lot and going across the street to the Pterodactyl.  Which is another great burger on the menu. Love the cheap prices including the drink specials. Can't beat $1.50 PBR on Monday or half price craft beers on Tuesday.  And don't the banana pudding is so big it comes with a to go container. It's that big.  The staff rocks and the music made me want to stay longer."}
{"text":"Started with a OMG Captain Jack Pilsner and a Crab HushPuppies. Beer is good but the puppies are fantastic! A crispy cornmeal batter surrounding creamy crab. A order of 12 deep fried Buffalo Wings( are favorite kind) , the Corndog Shrimp and a White Trash Burger. Order was partially taken by 3 different girls as they work in a \"team\" Now I'm waiting here for ANYBODY to bring the check now that we've been done for 15 minutes. Wings were not what we thought. Cooked the same way everyone else cooks them. Skin was not crispy at all. The corndog shrimp was pretty good. Nice big shrimp in a corndog crust but the batter wasn't too heavy. Burger was cooked medium well( no other option) I like mine medium rare but it was delicious with a nice grilled over charcoal taste."}
{"text":"This place is awesome food people everything is 5 stars you want leave hungry or disappointed"}
{"text":"Heard about Pinkys thru a good friend, who saw this on t.v from Food Network with Guy.  Not a lot of parking in the front of the building, so we had to park in the back (very muddy, and in need of repairs).  The wait was 45 mins...and was every bit of 45 minutes.  The hostess was really friendly, but the rest of the staff was OK.  I understand it was Friday around 8ish or 9ish and they were slammed.  Loved the set up of this little spot.  Got the crab puppies and they were Fantastic.  The white trash burger was okay, just need some season on the patty.  Overall it was good.  Not from Charlotte, but will come back for those crabpuppies."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit Pinkys for the first time since everyone was crazy about this place. First, you have a kind of cute view of uptown, the place is cute and full of things to make your eyes wander.  The food was not as good as everyone made it seem, the burgers were tasteless, they had no seasoning what's so ever. The fried pickles were extremely greasy, the \"White Trash Burger\" was over hyped, and I would rather pay 4$ for a Triple cheeseburger at Steak n Shake."}
{"text":"A very nice pre-birthday lunch...Definitely a must try is the Hummus as an appetizer with the artichoke, olives, red onion and tomato it is stupendously delicious!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for lunch  and  we stopped  in to see what  Pinky s  was all about. From the  parking lot,  I thought it was just some arcade  with some lite fare.  We entered an to my surprise there is a restaurant and full bar a few steps past the arcade. We were promptly  seated and got our drinks quickly. The wife  had the Greek pita with bacon. She said it was amazing and flavorful. I had the Hangover  burger and onion  straws. The burger  was really good and filling.  It was also  refreshing  to have a quick  lunch  under 22.00 dollars. Also, the bathrooms were clean. We will be back."}
{"text":"White trash hamburger is great the Crab Puppies are not as delicious as it sounds Staff is great"}
{"text":"I love bringing the kids here - It's a great place to go on a whim when you need a quick but quality meal."}
{"text":"Not enough time or vocabulary to talk about what makes this place great. I will say \"my favorite Charlotte restaurant\". Food is fresh made in house. Service raises the bar on how other places operate. Atmosphere is fun. Good drink menu. And a great place to learn more about Westside trends back in the 70's & 80's.  So far I've tried: Fried Pickles;  this is Charlotte's original recipe. Stray Dog; a veggie dog w/ veggie chili perfect for someone like me that wants a dog but doesn't eat beef. I'm addicted to these. Da Pimp; grilled pimento cheese. I didn't like PC but love theirs. Banana Pudding; Oh! So! Good! Ding Dong Chicken;  fried chicken breast w/ crunchy peanut butter & siracha. Crazy good! Be sure when you visit to get a pic w/the Pinkymobile."}
{"text":"I have eaten at pinkeys a handful of times. It has always been pretty good but tonight was a different story me and my wife both had the grilled chicken sandwich like some other people have said just no seasoning blan as could be very disappointing. I was born and raised in the south so i love my sweet tea but tonight it was so sweet you couldnt swallow it. Trying to be nice we ask the waiter to bring us 1 glass of unsweet so we could mix in with our glasses he acted like he was bothered kinda had an attitude the whole time with us uhhhhh. Then to top if off sat behind a group of yuppies who thought it was cool to cuss every other word and talk as loud as possible. Some people actually do bring there children in there to eat but not pinkeys fault just the kind of people they attract sometimes. Hopefully just an off night love places like this I will give them another shot"}
{"text":"Pinky's had a good atmosphere and great food. It had elevated bar food- good but not knock your socks off good. We got the crab hush puppies which were delicious. The corn dog shrimp and Korean BBQ pork tacos were also great."}
{"text":"Cheap, great burgers and waffle fries. Need anyone say more?"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! I've heard a lot about it around town and decided to give it a try. The service and food was the best I have experienced in a long time! They sat me and my friend down and maybe a minute later we had our drinks then maybe 5 minutes later we had our food hot and fresh out of the kitchen! Our drinks stayed full they always ask if everything was ok. All I can say is that overall the experience was amazing and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Where else can you get mac n' cheese with bacon on a burger?  This place is awesome. The food is great, the vibe is totally casual, and the people are all really friendly."}
{"text":"So glad I listened to Yelp!  This place was a delight!  The food is great - we had the hush pups to start which were the best I've ever had.  I had the cheeseburger and waffle fries - wonderful.  My friends had the fried pickles, corn dog, more waffle fries and the shrimp salad thingy - all very much enjoyed.  The ambiance was great.  If I lived in Charlotte, I would be going there every week."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Pinkys and decided it was finally time to try it out. We arrived and we're seated immediately. I appreciated the very quick and collective service that Pinkys provides, in which  all servers take care of all tables. The only issue I had with this is at one point I wasn't quite sure which person to track down to receive a fork for my food.   We ordered the crab puppies for an appetizer and man oh man oh man we're they good. I think I ate half of them instead of my meal. The tartar sauce that came with them was very rich and sour creamy which was a different but delicious offering. For dinner, I got the pinky dog which was very good but heavy and kind of hard to eat with it being topped so heavily with chili and cheese. My boyfriend had the Korean pork tacos which were really good and we shared a side of waffle fries that were cooked perfectly. Everything was really good but I still left a little disappointed. Maybe everyone has just talked it up way too much.   I did really really enjoy the atmosphere and decor in the restaurant and would recommend their very quick service! I would come back but try something new (except for the crab puppies, I will need those again)"}
{"text":"Fresh of the plane at CLT, I just HAD to eat before I made the drive back to WNC.  Yelp suggested a cool little spot called Pinky's.  I immediately dug the atmosphere and the funky vibe.  Grabbed a seat at the bar in a small(er) booth built for two (sort of).  Booth could have used a bit more elbow room but I didn't get knocked into, so I guess it was alright.  I wanted to grab a quick bite and head out, so instead of scouring the large menu, I opted for the Mammoth burger (two 5oz patties) with cheese and bacon (can never pass up bacon!) on a gluten-free bun (rejoice!).  At first, I was second-guessing the 5oz patty size, but when you want more than 8oz and less than 16oz (standard \"big burger\" size nowadays), 10oz is a pretty good compromise.  I chucked on a size of sweet potato fries for good measure.  Food came very quick, and I was off to the races.  Fries were tasty, with just the right amount of crisp vs bend. I enjoyed them with a touch of salt.  The burger looked stout thanks to the smaller and taller patties, but the crowning (no pun intended) glory was that bun.  I haven't ran into a non-plain, non-sucky gluten free bun yet - but this was interesting.  Poppy and sesame seed buns encased this burger, and I was very intrigued.  The burger was cooked well with a good amount of season, but could have used a bit more pizzaz.  I guess with all the options, the plain burgers are plain.  The bun broke apart like a GF bun should so I definitely don't fault them for that - but it was tasty.  I really thought Pinky's shined i the service department.  It felt as if I had the whole staff waiting on me, and was helped by no less than 5 or 6 of the waitstaff.  Great teamwork, and I never had to wait for anything (even though I didn't need much).   Price was very reasonable for the food offered.  Would definitely return to again when in the CLT area.  Only downside, seems as if the parking lot was a bit small, and there seemed to be some remodeling going on - not sure if that cut the spaces down or not, but hey, new improvements are awesome!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Pinky's and I must say I'm super impressed. The pimp'n fries are amazing and the burgers were also excellent. Portions are large and prices are very reasonable... we will be back. Pro tip: order the Swedish mule to drink!"}
{"text":"I'm in Atlanta and my son lives in Charlotte which leaves me frequently visiting food places there!  This time I called in my order and got Coby whom was quite a pleasure to talk to. He took my to go order of Wings and Fries easy and offered other menu items which I bought also.  My son went to pick it up and it was ready and so good within 10mins!"}
{"text":"The fried pickles with ranch are to die for! I love there food and the different types of burgers not like any other place. This is one of our favorite places to have date night"}
{"text":"My husband took me here and I really enjoyed the White trash burger. The fried pickles were thin, crisp and served with a homemade ranch that was great! We sat in the garage and they had the door open with a nice view of the city and a light breeze. Service was friendly and food came out quick. Definitely going again if I'm over that way."}
{"text":"I love Pinky's. The food is great & unique. Kris (bartender) is awesome and the art culture fits my style"}
{"text":"This place was super busy, and now I know why!! I had the potato soup (which was AMAZING), a Rueben hot dog (too much sauerkraut it was like a sauerkraut sandwich that happen to have a hot dog in it). My boyfriend had the mammoth burger. He was amazed with how big it was. He said it was amazing. Will definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Much different feel from the original pinkys. Very tall ceilings and spacious. Same great food. $15 pitcher of margaritas that gave us about 8 small glasses full. They make their own mix and it was excellent and such a great deal. Food is a la carte. We had crab poppers, fried zucchini, shrimp tacos and a burger. We loved all of it! Great service and the owner even came by to check on us."}
{"text":"Pinky's has delicious food and a quirky/funky atmosphere.  Do whatever you want for your meal, but save room for some banana pudding!"}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot about this place prior to visiting. I can only speak to what I had, which was a hot dog and sweet potato fries, but neither were that great. My fries weren't cooked well and the small hotdog was saturated with chili and slaw.  Those with burgers said they were good."}
{"text":"My husband found this place and happy we visited.  I had the hamburger which was ok, would not recommend.  I have found over the years that I am just bad at ordering food.  My husband had the shrimp salad which was tasty and my son had the chicken basket, real chicken.  We also had an order of homemade potato chips.  I would go back, but not for a hamburger."}
{"text":"Great service and food, this was my first time, prices so cheap and flavors uniques.  Green chile pork is amazing with gluten free bun.  And the baked wings are my favorites!"}
{"text":"This place was kinda wild. Funky is a pretty good way to describe it,  and I can see why it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives! Wild = good in my books, by the way!  My husband really wanted to try the crab hush puppies and I am glad he ordered them - they are super good! He ordered a white trash burger which he liked a lot, there is something about the meat that makes their burgers very tasty. Even the non-meat  (aka vegetarian) nature boy was seriously very good, though!  My order was right up my alley, a ding-dong style burger. This creation includes slaw, crunchy peanut butter and sriracha..and it really works. I did add some extra sriracha to cut thru the sweetness of the pb a bit, but I also really love spicy things.   I knew the pb/spice combo would work and be delicious because it's super similar to my staple breakfast; a toasted English muffin with pb, chili paste and cucumber.  Try it if you like this burger!"}
{"text":"Great food, unique names on the menu, great options,have been here a handful of times."}
{"text":"What can you say=Pinky's is very good.Greg makes sure \"everybody\", is taken care of.I have tried quite a few, of the menu item's.All were excellent.I also have to say-the desert's are the bomb!I had this chocolate-caramel cake that was so good!I go here and the one in Huntersville too-I also take out of town visitor's here-and when they return-they want to go back to Pinky's."}
{"text":"To the server with the red hair and bow tie tattoos: you're the worst server I have ever met in my life and I hope you quit your job and go work something else, because you're not going to cut it in the food industry. The fact that You took my order and my appetizer came out but my BOTTLED COORS LIGHT never came out really bothers me. It took me 38 minutes of sitting there just to finally get up and say something to a manager about how terrible you are. The bartender decided to walk over and tell me how she ran out of paper and never got the ticket. Lies. The manager told me the reason my food still hadn't come out was because you were down a cook. More lies. The final straw was when I informed the manager that you haven't been to my table since you took the order 38 minutes ago and she said \"Well we all work as a team here so it's everyone responsibility.\" Guess what! I'm a server! Guess what else! I work in a tip share restaurant where we ALSO TAKE CARE OF EVERYONES TABLES.  If I ever took someone's order and didn't check on them in 38 minutes, I would have been lit up by every other server on the floor + the manager. Wait wait wait, cook didn't show up and/or you ran out of printer paper? Don't give bs excuses to someone that has heard them all. It wasn't until after I said something to the manager about waiting for 38 minutes for a single beer and a burger that my stuff finally came out. Guess what! No cheese on my girlfriends \"cheeseburger\", no 3rd party on my \"Triple g\", And my waffle fries came out as an app and not my entree. Oh, and to top it all off: MY SERVER NEVER CAME BACK TO THE TABLE SINCE SHE TOOK MY ORDER AND I WAS THERE OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF! Terrible service, and terrible excuses by terrible managers for a restaurant that I went to solely based off of Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"This place is cool!  The decor is awesome!  Service is great!  They don't specify a person to your table just whoever is walking by will take care of you.  They definitely have a system and it works.  Food is eclectic and good.   I had buffalo shrimp tacos with black beans.  It was incredible.   Crab hush puppies were interesting and good.   The best thing though was banana pudding.  Huge serving for very little cost.  Really delicious.   Go at off times though.  You will wait."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since we randomly stumbled across it while exploring a side of the city we had never been to. I have since heard many good things and checked out the menu online. I knew this was my chance to try a burger with peanut butter on it and I reserved that experience for Pinky's.  First things first, the parking lot is kind of a mess. We were lucky enough to find a spot on a busy night, but trying to get out was more difficult. There were a lot of people waiting, but having only two in our party, we sat immediately. (I wouldn't recommend for large groups on busy nights.) I got a burger Ding Dong Style and my wife got the White Trash Burger - we also split the \"Pimp'n Fries\" (pimento cheese, bacon waffle fries). The Ding Dong Burger had honey cole slaw, crunchy peanut butter, and siracha hot sauce. It was ok, I could have used a touch more hot sauce. The wife felt the same about hers. I like my burgers medium - we weren't asked and both came out well-done. The star was the fries. The pimento cheese is delicious. There are a few things that I might go back for, but the location (far from my apartment) means it probably won't be for a while."}
{"text":"I've eaten here more times than I can count, and have yet to have a negative experience. The food is great, and the staff is extremely friendly. My favorite menu items include: crab puppies, white bean hummus plate, ding dong chicken sandwich, and buffalo shrimp tacos. Their cocktail menu is definitely work checking out, too -- lots of fun drinks to try."}
{"text":"I had the veggie burger because i felt like being different.  It was amazing.  I was waited on by a few people during my visit, but I don't really mind that as long as they keep my drink full and they did."}
{"text":"Berry Dark n Stormy features King of Pop popsicle was AWESOME! Corn dog shrimp are a crowd favorite. We had excellent customer service. Various staff checked on us and accommodated our needs. I will and am always a returning customer. Make sure you try the Sundrop poundcake for dessert."}
{"text":"After looking at restaurants to take my sister to after landing in Charlotte, we decided upon Pinky's. My sister specifically stated wanting yummy greasy food to feel like she was back home in the states so this restaurant seemed like a great option. Upon entering, we loved the punk vibe of the restaurant and the awesome music playlist. The hostess was very sweet and got us seated quickly. We then had a friendly waitress quickly take our order. We ordered drinks which were all really good and fairly priced.   The low ratings are for the actual meal. I don't know if I came here on a bad day or if I just have superior taste buds but the food here was terrible. I ordered a white trash burger and it tasted like a middle school cafeteria burger. The beef was low quality, dry and lacked any flavor. I only took 3 bites and was over it. My sister had the chili dog and that too had a terrible quality of meat and lacked any great flavor. The pimento cheese fries were good but didn't have enough cheese so many of the fries were dry. The fish taco also was mediocre. The wings were like any standard wings, nothing special.  Overall, if you want a cool vibe with good drinks and friendly service, give this place a try. If you're actually trying to eat some decent food, find another restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!!!! Ordered a sandwich I wasn't a fan of and they were more than happy to exchange it for something else. The sandwich was not terrible, but it was misleading and I thought it was going to be pork and not chicken. I also happen to be the only person on earth who doesn't like chicken, but they made me feel fine about it. One of the servers even told me \"you got something you didn't like and we don't want that we want you to enjoy and have something you love. We're happy to do it\" They were amazing all around. Love them!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte and went on Yelp to find somewhere to eat. Found this place. It was delicious. I had a cheeseburger with fried pickles, onion rings, and provolone cheese. Amazing. Service was great and they were very friendly. Would definitely eat here again if I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere but very hipster. If you aren't into that then this isn't the place for you"}
{"text":"Amazing salmon salad that they had special. $6.95 for a 6 ounce salmon filet over greens with a delicious citrus dressing. Of course their burgers are amazing, but it was nice to go healthy and still get great food!"}
{"text":"Don't miss the westside Randy (?) with bacon, and the white trash burger.  I've had both and can't wait for another drive though Charlotte to try something else. This isn't necessarily a place to take Grandmaw! It's loud and proud, and don't take crap. roving servers are a little weird at first but makes for superior service to go with the kick ass chow. I could easily say 5 stars but  I am sober tonight."}
{"text":"Chicken philly was awesome.  Wings were really good and the pulled pork tacos were the best."}
{"text":"We decided to try Pinky's for lunch today since we were in Huntersville.  Anyplace that has a section called \"Wiener Wonderland\" on their menu is going to attract my hubby like a tick to a dog!  He chose the Southern 500 dog and opted for a side of chips.  I decided on the white trash burger with a side of fried squash.  I'm not a big fan of fried pickles so I pulled those off but otherwise it was a decent burger.  We both enjoyed our choices but agreed that, while good, it's not a place we would make a special trip to go to.   The service was excellent to be sure.  If we go back I'd probably try something different (like fish or chicken tacos).  They do offer a 10% veteran's discount which was a nice surprise for Hubby and much appreciated."}
{"text":"8 absolutely love this place.  The White Trash Burger is out of this world.  Great food and awesome place."}
{"text":"I went here last night for the 4th or so time. So good. I picked up some burgers and a patty melt and some appetizers that were still hot when I got home (I live 15 min away). The guy that checked me out was super nice. The burgers, always great. The ranch sauce for the pickles is awesome, we saved the rest!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I came here instead of eating at the hotel or company has us staying at.  The food was amazing. I had the white trash burger and a side of fried pickles. Everything was so good and the customer service was wonderful.  If I was in town again, id definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is good. Fried pickles were really good. Burgers were good. Wish I could choose that the doneness but it was still good. They brought up the idea of banana pudding and it was really good. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a loud, funky place to eat! I was really happy I came for dinner. The burgers are fantastic! Even liked the fried pickles!! I'd skip the sweet potato fries in favor of the onion rings next time. Overall lots of fun and good food in a very relaxed atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Fun place.... Courteous waitstaff.... I ordered a fried appetizer that tasted like the oil needed to be changed."}
{"text":"I have been to Pinky's a couple of times and it does not disappoint.  A plus for Pinky's is that they have a lot of vegetarian options.  I decided to go with Big John, which is a 6 oz chicken breast, fried or grilled topped with swiss cheese, bacon, honey mustard, lettuce & tomato on a seeded bun.  I got the Big John minus the bacon with waffle fries.  The sandwich is really good but nothing unique about it.  The waffle fries are really good.  I would also recommend the veggie chili and falafel.  You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu and the service is really good as well."}
{"text":"If you are in Charlotte, you have to go to Pinky's! It's got great atmosphere and the food is not only different, it's damn good! I had the Nature Boy burger Ding dong style. I would never think I'd  say chunky peanut butter is good on a veggie burger, but it really is. We ate there at 4pm on a Saturday and they were pretty busy.  And don't forget to get a banana pudding to go.  It's huge and it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Burgers are stacked high, music is rocking and the Corn Dog Shrimp is next level. Easily one of the best burgers I have had. Parking is a little crazy but just use the adjacent lot. Place has some wait time but it's definitely worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch and have not had a bad meal. Prices are reasonable and the service staff is great. The place is a landmark and it's worth the wait. Because you will wait!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had wanted to try this place since it was featured on Triple D. Pinky's did not disappoint! The food was outstanding and the menu was quirky and creative! The staff was friendly and delivered excellent service."}
{"text":"Great burger! I had the mammoth white trash burger... Massive size and massive flavor! I want to lick the paper it came on but there weren't any juices to slobber up..."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect at this joint but let me tell you I was very pleased that we decided to stop here. The fried pickles were very yummy and a small was more than enough for two.  Overall the food was generously portioned, hot, and delicious. The wait staff were pretty fantastic too.  We might just have to make this a regular stop when we're passing through."}
{"text":"Always good. Service is always spectacular. Keep in mind the servers share tables so you probably won't see the same one twice, but they have a system for it and it works. Get the pimento cheese fries with bacon added. Drink specials are always on point. Oh and the blue cheese here is like crack, I can't tell you why."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times. I don't know what the hype is because I have never gotten anything that I would order again. Nothing super terrible but nothing very good either."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars. Let me repeat... I RARELY give 5 stars. But this place was on point! I had the White Trash Burger and added bacon (bacon elevates everything... it's a known fact) and switched out the cheese for pepper jack. I had sweet potato fries and they were fresh and AWESOMMMEEE!!! Even my Arnold Palmer was GOOD! It had pink lemonade in it. Check the photo!   My burger was juicy. I loved the crunchy pickles on it. The burger was perfect for my hands... it's like... it was made to fit in my hands... and in my mouth.   The waitress was mad attentive. I require the bare minimum, but she kept checking on us, asking how everything was. Even another lady came through to see how everything was going. Now if I get the bare minimum, I usually leave a 20% tip; but I think I left like 30something%   Bravo Pinky's... Bravo!"}
{"text":"Westside hangout that's funky,  busy,  and on top of their game.   Large selection of food (bar sandwiches, etc) which will require a few more trips to absorb it all.   I think I can manage!   Love the music,  too."}
{"text":"My friends and i go here atleast twice a month. I always get the same thing white trash burger, but the last time 2 times ive went i got the speicals which was fried green tomato on texas toast and the pulled pork cuban. The fried green tomato sandwich was one of the best sandwhichs I've had. It was so great so if you see it on the menu order it if you like to try new things. I love the staff always nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"Cool and Quirky place with some very interesting items on the menu. Tried several items and all were great!"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Charlotte!! We eat here almost once a week! The most perfect drunk food, even if you aren't drunk. Do NOT miss the Pimpin Fries!"}
{"text":"I usually go to THE DIAMOND for my american food cravings, but pinky's menu is more diverse and let's face it... their burgers just taste better.  And they have sweet potato fries.  No brainer in my book.  This is the #1 place for american food that will clog your arteries, but make your stomach happy."}
{"text":"Compelled to share a brief review after two visits - very accommodating to our family and in particular to children (which prompted our second visit, and surely future ones). Staff had a great attitude! Good food and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Ate here today for lunch for the first time. I want to give it 5 stars but here's what stops me. The service. Cold service. What I mean by that is , they could care les if you were here or not. They have their famous endorsements and all, but lack the sincere warm spirit you hope to expect.  Food was great!  Burger was awesome and fresh. Corn dog shrimp was amazing. Waffle fries were made from frozen of course and just warm, but overall the food is what will make me possibly come back. Maybe next time they might try engaging with customers with a warm smile and genuine how are you, before they bark, \"Whatcha wanna drink?\""}
{"text":"If you come here, absolutely get the crab hush puppies, totally worth it. Great music, service is solid and a fun patio, although it's right by the road so traffic is a little noisy. Had a mammoth burger which was the perfect amount of food with the crab puppies shared with someone. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Went for the second time with some friends yesterday and again, it was a great experience. Service is super quick each time I've been despite it being packed both occasions. Prices are great and the drink specials, on select nights, are excellent. Let's talk about the food...   Their waffle fries are awesome. I can't tell the difference between theirs and Chick-fil-a's (that's a good thing). If you like patty melts, definitely try the Maddy Paddy Melt. It's standard, but it's done extremely well. My buddy got the corn dog shrimp, which is basically a hushpuppy/corn dog bite with a shrimp in the middle. There is a reason this place was featured on Diner's Drive's and Dive's, go check it out yourself. You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"We love visiting Triple D places, but this one disappointed us.  First so nosiy and loud we couldn't talk to each other. Second, the fried items were soaked in grease- the fries, hush puppies, shrimp.  When you touched them the grease oozed out.  And they were so dark, the grease may be old, heaven forbid they double dipped them... The buffalo shrimp tacos had too much blue cheese crumbles that it over powered the buffalo sauce, had I to scrape some of them off. The black beans that accompanied the tacos were just ok.  My date had the white trash burger. It's a mess, so be sure to have plenty of napkins if you get it with double patties."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Charlotte. Hands down. Burgers are incredible, fried pickles are the bomb, french fries are delicious. Fun atmosphere!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, great atmosphere, great beer. Some of my favorites are the corndog shrimp and the white trash burger. I tried this place because it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives from the Food Network and I was not disappointed.  This is a great local diner. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there's no convenient parking, it can get too crowded and loud, and I feel like while they have some great craft beer, there could be more variety to it, especially better supporting the local breweries. With that said, I'll be eating here over and over again."}
{"text":"Love this place. You just cant go wrong. Been here many times and never a complaint. Quality food, great service, fun atmosphere- what more could you want!?"}
{"text":"Meh - I was totally not impressed. I've been driving past this plae for 3 years so maybe I had hyped it up, but my burger was truely mediocre."}
{"text":"This place was a lot better than I thought it would be but still just decent. The environment is very casual, staff is super friendly, and very inexpensive. I ordered the crab puppies and the nature boy(veggie burger). My friends ordered the chicken patsy melt and the jive turkey. My food was good but I've had better, however my friends did not enjoy the food at all especially the chicken patsy (she said the chicken was extremely dry). Personally, I would still try this place again especially for the crab puppies alone!!(they were that good)"}
{"text":"We've tried Pinky's 3 different times. The atmosphere is really fun with the decor, but for some reason the service lacks a bit of luster and could be more friendly. The menu has great great potential and some high points. I adore the garlic parsley dipping sauce and my husband loved the corndog shrimp. Good...but still hoping for the greatness factor to increase!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. I ordered the Falafel Salad and I was not disappointed! My husband ordered the Greek pots (added chicken) with sweet potatoes fries. Looked amazing too! Their honey mustard for the fries was soooo good!! Will be back when we are visiting for sure!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte, for both the food and the decor. I've been here several times, and almost everything off of the menu I've tried has been fantastic. The appetizers are my favorite part! The pimp'n fries are perfectly cooked waffle fries topped with gobs of melty pimento cheese - amazing. The crab puppies are perfectly fried hushpuppies with just the right hint of crab. You also can't go wrong with the sweet potato chips and wasabi ranch dressing dipping sauce. After appetizers like this, it takes true dedication to power through to the entree portion of the meal! My favorite is the corn dog shrimp - jumbo shrimp deep fried in wads of delicious corn dog batter?! Genius. I've also enjoyed the salads before, which are fresh and flavorful. All of the food comes in paper baskets, which can make ordering a salad interesting, but no big deal. My boyfriend loves the burgers, although he prefers \"everything\" style rather than \"westside\" style (the chili/slaw topped option). I've also enjoyed the grilled Greek pita sandwich. And while I felt I had to try the Ding Dong Chicken sandwich (chicken breast topped with crunchy peanut butter, sriracha, and slaw), I felt it was worth trying once but not my thing. I have yet to try one of their hot dogs (and they offer veggie dogs too!). Their cocktail menu is also pretty extensive and appealing. I took my dad here and he loved the colorful Andy Warhol-ish paintings of celebs on the wall, as well as all of the Frankenstein memorabilia - we're big fans of classic horror movies. The prices here are also fantastic! You can walk away completely satisfied (albeit full of fried goodness and alcohol) for pretty darn cheap. A Charlotte gem!"}
{"text":"Green chile pork and fish tacos are delicious. Cool place, good prices."}
{"text":"Well, Pinky's can add another good review to their ever-growing list.  My only gripe with this place is that it is no longer right next to my residence in Midwood in its former incarnation as the Penguin.  That said, I'm thrilled that this little corner of Morehead St. is getting some love with new restaurants and yoga studios, and since it's so close to Uptown, it's not too out of the way to visit.  I actually like this venue much better than the Penguin. As others have noted, the space at Pinky's is not just larger but nicer (the lighting, maybe?)  It has a really great ambiance and excellent jukebox.  We went on a weekend night, and they had great pitcher specials and very friendly service for our somewhat large group.  And, of course, the fried pickles were amazing--best in Charlotte, in my opinion.  I only had a veggie corndog, sans sides, which seemed a little skimpy to me given the price, but I'm going to expand my menu horizons at a later date and report back accordingly.   In sum and in conclusion, I think this is a great place for a quick bite or to visit after work to unwind with a beer and a snack."}
{"text":"Bought 26 crab puppies to go, received hush puppies instead. Thanks for the Hr drive to dive."}
{"text":"How can a place be an awesome biker bar and kid-friendly at the same time?   Here's a list of reasons, in no particular order, why this place f'ing rules: **Vintage KISS pinball machine **The crab puppies were so good that even Dylan D., the pickiest f'ing eater in the world, loved them **Having a sleeve of tattoos seems to be a requisite for employment **Photo booth **Excellent, filling salads (I loved my Buffalo Shrimp) **Good selection of beers on tap **Good wine list"}
{"text":"It was seriously just OK. My rule of thumb is this, if I can make it just as good, why am I here? I want to be dazzled, just a little. The burger was average. Not very flavorful. The waffle fries were chewy. Definitely either not fresh or frozen. Again, I could've made it much better. The staff was nice except some profanity with customers at the bar. I would've cringed if my family was with me for sure. I'm thinking they need to step it up a bit. I might be back, but with all the other choices popping up, probably not."}
{"text":"I love this place.   It is a total hole in the wall but the prices and great and the food is better. Service is always quick and efficient. A lot of times I get a cocktail and on Friday they have craft beer roulette which is fun.  Unicorn Tears cocktail = delicious. As for food, I've liked everything that I've gotten. I tend to get the Westside Randy pita with chicken on it and a side of delicious fried goodness onion rings.  We go all the time. Never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! I have been here to many times I've lost count! I normally come here during the weekends but this time 2 friends and I decided to come for lunch on a Friday. It does not matter the day or the time, Pinky's is always packed. However, the waiting time is not bad since they have many tables.  The parking at the restaurant is pretty small however they have a parking lot a few steps from the restaurants that fits a lot of cars.  Everything they serve is good, but I always go with the shrimp corn dog and the waffle fries. They are my favorite and I can't go there without having them! One one my friends had a chicken sandwich that she said was good and the other one had the white trash burger with some fried squash that she really enjoyed. My meal as always was really good!  The servers are nice and attentive. Since they are always busy the food can take a little while to get ready so if you are in a rush this is definitely not the place for you.  The decoration is cool and different and their prices are great! I didn't know they had banana pudding but reading the reviews on Yelp I found that they served some pretty good one. I had to find out myself and was really surprised! It costed a little bit over 3$ and was so much banana pudding that I had to take home to share with my husband! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The staff are so laid back in personality, but in service they're 100%. I love this place. I'm not hip to the music but this place has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I recently read an article that this is 1 of the 50 places to eat in CLT before I die. I did. I had the White Trash Burger and homemade potato chips. All in all, it was a good experience. I wouldn't say it is a MUST. I'm glad I tried it. Don't see me dying to go back, though."}
{"text":"If I could give Pinky's more than 5 Stars, I would. Super friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable staff, quick service, and DELICIOUS food that are the perfect portion sizes. I highly recommend the hot dog and waffle fries (I think the only kind of fries they serve). Also, ALL Absolut Vodka drinks are $5 on Saturdays. Family friendly and wheelchair accessible."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was really nice.  I had the philly cheese steak sandwich. I forgot tip question what comes on it bc it wasn't a menu item. I wish the waitress would've thought to inform me anyway since it's not a everyday menu item. It was filled with onions they were sliced big and mushrooms. I also ordered a basket of loaded fries(cheese, chilli & bacon bits). They were the BOMB.COM!! The drink Unicorn Tears was a pretty good drink(girly drink). Overall I still liked Pinky's."}
{"text":"Ohh pinky's my favorite local place.  Not only is everything great. This weekend you decided to make a fried oyster po boy.  That by far, was the best thing I have ever had down here.  It made me feel like I was New Orleans it was that friggin good.  As always the crab hush puppies were on par, but dang, make the fried oyster Po Boy part of your menu!"}
{"text":"My coworkers & I went here for lunch today.  We were not satisfied.  The special soup was potato overload, yet there was no potato's in the soup.  I ordered the vegetarian chilli & it was not hot.  It also taste pretty bad.  The service was good, but unfortunately that didn't make up for the lack of bad food."}
{"text":"Want a relaxed experience and a yummilicious meal?   Try pinky's west side grill.   Only drawback was the loud traffic but the outdoor dining was great otherwise.  Best today:   Crab puppies!  Woah Nellie!   I'll make it back soon to this DD&D joint."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to try this place while we were visiting Charlotte. I gotta say, im a fan! I had the Ancho BBQ wings and the White Trash Burger, both were excellent. I also loved the beer deals they had going on Friday night. The Craft Beer Roulette is a fun way to try new beers for 3$ that they normally charge 5$ for!"}
{"text":"Loved the crab puppies and drinks were great. My wife and I Like this place so far just might become one of our weekday spots."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this Charlotte institution. The crab hush puppies came w/a hard crunchy fried shell.  It wasn't greasy just very little flavor.  The double burger I'm not sure that it was a hamburger there was no flavor whatsoever.  It was like the burgers that you'd get in the school caf as a kid.  The Greek Pita sandwich tasted primarily of feta & I was able to see that there were tomatoes & olives I couldn't taste them.  Waffle fries were limp - not crisp.  It was overly loud & warning don't look up at the ceiling, the black highlights the dust that reflects that the place hasn't seen a good deep clean in quite some time."}
{"text":"Best veggie burgers in town! Service is a little slow, mainly because the place is packed all the tine. The restaurant itself has a lot of character. I haven't tried the veggie dog, but that's my next choice."}
{"text":"Had a bbq burger with sweet potato fries...great burger with great atmosphere. Had a lot of fun, the parking lot is small...I didn't get to eat the fries but I'm liking forward to it"}
{"text":"We decided to venture out to Pinky's tonight and it did not disappoint! It's smaller than I expected and there was a 20 minute wait but as soon as we sat down we were greeted and had our drinks quickly. We didn't have one server, instead whoever was nearby came over to ask us if we needed anything. The service was excellent! We got the popcorn chicken salad, regular burger, and waffle fries. The popcorn chicken is really good and their honey mustard is homemade and one of the best I've ever had! My fiancé really enjoyed his burger as well. We decided to have the banana pudding for dessert and it definitely stole the show. The serving was ENORMOUS!! Definitely enough for 4 people. It was soooooo good! It's a must try if you visit!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent but I will say that the service was spectacular!  I would drive thru here just to have these folks serve me this great food!  BTW watched the Masters here too!"}
{"text":"Pinkys is first class! From the fish tacos to the white trash burger  you cannot go wrong. Great atmosphere with a punk rock attitude. I also recommend the fried pickles.  Also a location on Freedom Drive in Charlotte. Good eats. Great peeps!"}
{"text":"UPDATE - So I get a message in my inbox from the owner (Andy C.) and he sends me a link (https://youtu.be/kRRK4loO6xQ) to a Anthony Bourdain interview where they mention the word Yelp and he says \"F em\". Nothing worse than an elite Yelper? Pardon me, but is this the way a manager should respond to a customer's problem? I think not. The message was very passive-aggressive and I expected more from the top of the company. Really liked your establishment. Seriously. Ruined it for me,man. Integrity shot. Didn't deserve this treatment.  Terrible manager - Ran into manager on duty who was terrible at customer service. Came to hang a poster for a show and get a bite to eat. While this might have been the first time I did not have tape on me to hang the poster, usually I do have it. I asked a server on hand if they might have some tape. The server tells the manager who comes out and tells me \"Sorry you can't hang your poster. We don't sell supplies we sell burgers\". Thing is I always come here so I'm well aware of what they sell there. Let her know it's not ever cool to talk to a customer the way she did and she tells me she thought what she said was funny. No remorse and no apology. Gotta do better on the front,Pinky's."}
{"text":"I love Pinkys! They have quite a variety on the menu, burger is definitely what they are known for though. They offer a build your own burger if you don't like the preset burger choices. It's always super packed at lunch because it's so close to uptown. The only negative I can say is that the burgers aren't cooked to order because they are the super think burger patties. I think this place would be my favorite burger joint if they cooked to order!   ProTip: try the Pimp Fries that are covered in Pimento Cheese :)"}
{"text":"Was down in NC for work training and happened upon this place on yelp. Lookin' for a nice casual spot to have lunch before heading back to the airport. We sat outside, which was really nice. Service was quick and efficient, no frills. Food came quickly, the fried pickles were deliciously awesome. Wish I could've tried more menu items! Pretty good beer list and cocktails too! Main reason why we headed on over. Would recommend for a nice casual lunch/dinner. Try the outdoor seating if the day is nice! :)"}
{"text":"This really is my favorite place in all Charlotte. I love the ambiance, the staff and the food. Oh yeah, their cocktails are creative and tasty. My favorite: the Malibu Red Margarita."}
{"text":"Was in town for business. This was close to the office. Didn't expect much. Was pleasantly surprised. Coldest beer I had on my trip. Got the White Trash Burger with some sort of battered veggie. Delicious. Best burger I had on my trip. Service excellent. Will back when come into town."}
{"text":"Upon walking in you feel like you just stepped onto the set of Rock Band. Just like their Charlotte location they have non-themed funky decor and music blasting. Service is great. All American bar food with a few exotic flavors here and there. They do offer several vegetarian options which is a plus. Everything is reasonable priced and something for everyone, even kids with the lack of a \"kids menu\". Be careful with their fish sammy. Depending on the delivery and day it can be off and taste really fishy. It's a hit or miss. I dig their falafel wrap. It's not NYC street vendor quality but  decent non-greasy-healthier version. I've been here a few times hoping it's just as great as their Charlotte location but sadly, it's just not the same."}
{"text":"Good if you're craving greasy, relatively cheap food! Every time I eat here, I leave feeling like trash because everything is DROWNING in grease (but sometimes you just eat a craving for that kind of stuff). Their veggie burger is good (again--deep fried so not really healthy). Fried pickles and crab hush puppies are really good. You can get your burger \"white trash style\" to get fried pickles and spicy sauce on top-- pretty good option if you ask me"}
{"text":"When we travel, we like visiting local dives, so when my husband and I were in Charlotte for the Thunder Road Marathon, we hit Pinky's for some pre-race grub. I asked a bunch of friends where to eat locally, and whoever suggested Pinky's had the right idea. We usually don't go for big chains, etc.   Plus, it was convenient to downtown and had a parking lot- plus very little wait. Score!   I had the Nature Boy, which was a veggie burger. The burger was topped with cheese and roasted red peppers (interesting burger topping), and I got them to add spinach as well instead of iceberg lettuce. It was served on a sesame seed bun and pretty delicious- very large burger and filling, but I didn't leave overly stuffed.   There is an entirely vegetarian and vegan menu, you may need to ask for it, but it's *huge*. Anyone from a vegan to a carnivore can find something to eat at Pinky's and enjoy it.   Hubs had some wings and the \"white trash burger\" and seemed to enjoy it. Make sure to try the sirarcha ranch sauce- it's great. Also the prices here are incredibly cheap. It's really a steal, both of us ate for just over $20 and that almost never happens. The entrees do not come with sides but you can easily order and split some.   My only gripe was that everything was disposable, not the best for the environment. I'm sort of a hippie, but I really wish I had my burger on a plate rather than in a disposable basket. The cups/bar glasses were the only non-disposable things.   Pinky's decor is pretty amazing too- a fun VW bug outside and one on the roof, plus neat stickers and signs inside. All your senses get fed here, not just your tastebuds. Definitely check it out if you're in Downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Pinky's redeemed themselves.  With a group of 7 people (some of whom were drunk) coming in 15 minutes before closing, they were genuinely happy to serves us.  Two servers took our orders and got everything correct.  Food was good this time around.  I was one of the DD's so I know the food didn't taste good just because I was drunk."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and found this place very easily. The parking lot was full: always a good sign! Not a whole lot of seating in the \"lobby\" if you have to wait long, but luckily they got us seated pretty quickly. Had to check out the pickle chips as I'm a fan, and they didn't disappoint. Good balance of seasoning and crispiness for the breading; although, we had to ask for the ranch dressing that's supposed to come with it. This did lead to some confusion because by this time we had seen three different servers, and I wasn't quite sure who to ask: the one who took our beverage, the one who brought it, or the one who took our food order, or the one who brought our appetizer. I see someone else commented on this, and I gather by connecting the dots that the restaurant does not have servers assigned to sections. This does make it a little confusing for the customer when you are trying to figure out who to ask for things or for that matter who you are tipping. The burgers were juicy and tasty, albeit they were lacking in the presentation. The food baskets they come in are so small that you really can't get a good look at them. Oh well, just pick them up and bite in! Ordered the White Trash and a Cheeseburger Ding Dong Style. Have to say I favored the latter. The White Trash was a little bland and really couldn't taste the sauce, but the flavor of the Ding Dong is banging: peanut butter and honey-cilantro slaw. Who would have thought!?!  We ordered onion rings as a side, and I would certainly suggest to pass on those. They're not really onion rings, more like onion straws, and even that is a stretch. The breading was falling off of them, and they were difficult to pick up. There were very few \"rings\" in the basket, too. Wish they had a description on the menu because if I knew I was not ordering onion rings we certainly would have ordered something different. One last thing to be aware of...no kids menu. I realize it's not a family joint per se, but we weren't the only ones with kids in the joint. Certainly able to find something they would enjoy, but the portion size and price for kids was a bit much."}
{"text":"This place is what I like to call FUNKY FRESH!  A true gem of Charlotte, with people from all walks of life and menu items that are more eccentric than the customers.  Just to give you a little taste - menu items include everything from sriracha to crunchy peanut butter to wieners... what more could you ask for?!  We went for lunch today and the service was quick and helpful.  Prices are reasonable and the selection is large.  There are some healthy options, but why waste your time when you know you want to dive into some fried pickles or sweet potato fries.  I will say there were a lot of vegan/vegetarian options - which was a nice surprise.  Overall I give this place 5 stars because it's not trying to be anything other than what it is.  Plus they have triceratops toys placed inconspicuously all over the entire restaurant.  Bonus points!"}
{"text":"I was let down by the onion rings. Other than that everything yummy! Onion rings were just on bland side. Loved the crab puppies, and we couldnt even finish then. Nothing comes with sideS. Would certainly eat again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great environment ND atmosphere. I can see this as a fun place for all ages and diversity of people. The southern dogs and fries were good. Got the Buffalo wings as an appetizer, okay, not like Buffalo NY wings but they were meh. Servers were great, sociable and on the spot. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"When here for the first time An the service was fast an accurate as well as the food it is worth your money .... for you go please try the Unicorn Tears best drink on menu"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time three weeks ago, after seeing them on Diners, Drive-in and Dives. Since then, I have been back 3 times. My favorite is the Mammoth with cheese, Westside style. YUM! I've had the Pimp'n Fries and their cookieful Banana Pudding. OMG, Soooo good!. Nice atmosphere and great staff! Helpful and friendly. At times I thought I had 3 waitresses. I don't know what the others are saying, but I know this is the joint for a good old southern pack on a pound burger!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to get into a long diatribe about this place that hasn't already been said before, so I'll keep it short and sweet...  That's some of the best food I've ever had at a transmission shop!"}
{"text":"You can't find a better place for waffle fries and the vegan selection is awesome!!! If you get a break or get it white trash style.  You can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars for the chicken philly and the spicy shrimp tacos!!! Place is always busy. Friendly staff. Sides are sold separately"}
{"text":"I was searching for cheap eats on yelp, and Pinky's came up.  I went down with a friend to try it out.  This is kind of a hole in the wall.  Had to park in an open lot around back.  Inside is a bar, and booths, and tables.  The décor provides  a Noda feel.  The music was a variety of rock / alternative, from Metallica, to the Ramones.   We ordered sweet potato chip with wasabi ranch dressing as an appetizer, and they were great!   I ordered fish tacos, my friend ordered the Ding Dong Chicken sandwich.  The fish tacos were delicious, and the Chicken was even better!  Oh, and the service couldn't be better.   All of the staff checked in on us throughout our stay.  Between the music, and the patrons, the environment is a tad loud, but the atmosphere is upbeat, and happy.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It was OK, nothing to brag about. We don't drink, so maybe that was why we didn't love it. The food was good, but nothing to brag about. We liked the décor, and I used the parking at Dunkin Donuts like I read about on Yelp.  I guess since I can't remember anything to say about the food, says it all. Just average."}
{"text":"Yummmm! So good.  Cheap food, great specials and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"rad vegetarian selection, rad staff, rad drink specials. i can't get enough of this place. the jive turkey is my fave!"}
{"text":"Pinky's is everything I could hope for in a diner. Cheap beer, awesome burgers, and enough for leftovers. I've ate here several times, got something different each time and I've always left euphoric. I usually start with their crab hushpuppies; crunchy, slightly sweet, and perfectly complemented by spicy ranch sauce. Their burgers are good quality and very flavorful too. I tried the ding dong style, and the eclectic mix of sweet peanut butter and spicy sriracha do wonders. I was skeptical beforehand but they've made a believer out of me.   Great value, excellent food, and relatively close to BoA Stadium have made Pinky's one of my new favorite burger joints. Well worth the five minute drive from uptown."}
{"text":"Amazing wings and great service! Love the environment and music as always! Love the fact it is kid friendly as well"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this funky little place. Stopped in on a whim when looking for something different. Come to find out it was featured on an episode of diners drive ins and dives! Menu is diverse with a little something for everyone and They have some interesting little food combos that you think wouldn't go together but do, which makes for a fun food adventure. They also have beer and liquor and run different specials almost every night. If you are in the area and looking for something different, definitely give this place a stop!"}
{"text":"Made the visit based on the Yelp reviews. The burgers were good, and my husband had a hot dog as well and he said it was fantastic. Went during busy lunch rush but service was still fast and prompt and we didn't wait long at all for our food. What more can you ask for, great service, good food at a reasonable price and served fairly quickly. We will be back next time we visit or are passing through Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great place to eat!! The service and food were outstanding!!! I would highly recommend eating here. Our large group was catered to like we own the place. Great music and atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time trying out Pinky's and it was a successful visit! We got there at 7pm on a Friday and got seated right away. Our waitress was really friendly and prompt to get our drink and appetizer order. They have a good beer selection and a really good fun mixed drink selection.  Now for the food.....we order the hush pups for an appetizer. You get 12, fairly large sized hush pups with a side of tartar sauce. The hush pups were really good! It was just my husband and I and we had some to take home! For dinner I order the White Trash burger. It was a very tasty, juicy burger! Cannot go wrong with fried onion strings and fried pickles on a burger! It did not come with a side so I ordered waffle fries, also good! My husband ordered the popcorn chicken tossed in buffalo sauce. He thought they were really good and had a nice spice. It clearly showed since ate them rather quickly! Something fun to mention, the food and silverware is all picnic style in that it's all disposable. Kinda fun! The whole staff walks around to make sure you have what you need throughout your meal so you are never sitting there waiting for your waitress! The atmosphere was cool and funky! Very lively decor and fun music and TVs to watch the NCAA tournament that was on. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location and the one in Huntersville and they NEVER DISAPPOINT! Fast friendly staff and the food is phenomenal! I highly recommend their Pimpin' Fries with bacon added and Ranch! Also try their White Trash Burger! Very eclectic bunch but great atmosphere for anyone!"}
{"text":"Brace yourself... I'm about to blow.your.mind... Ding dong chicken TACOS... boom. Wait... whattt? Yup. Just ask your server for the Ding dong chicken sandwich as tacos.   Get yo butt into Pinky's today... Feel free to send a compliment to thank me later :)"}
{"text":"The food was OK. That's it. The burger was not seasoned enough and the toppings were put on very sloppy. My mate had a fish sandwich and send the same. Bland food. The wings were ok as well. Prices are fair and you do get enough food to fill you up. But nothing comes with the burgers or sandwiches so you have to order fries separate. Downer. The overall appearance of the place was cool. Hard seats but cool decorations. Very laid back music. Nice bar area. The bartender looks like Jesus. Might not come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations and loved it. The food was great and the service was awesome. Fun atmosphere and perfect for a fun date or lunch with friends."}
{"text":"I really expected more from all the hype I'd heard surrounding this place. It's near my work and I'd heard their food was amazing. After visiting them 4 different times for business lunches and a birthday party, aside from some decent Fried pickles, you'll find nothing more than below average bar food and sandwiches. I would steer clear and ignore this overrated sentimental bar and grill."}
{"text":"Delicious hush puppies and yummy food. The fried chicken was good and the waffles fries were enjoyable, although could be a bit crunchier. The coleslaw was nice but nothing special. Definitely worth trying out with a lovely atmosphere. A view of the Charlotte skyline if you sit outside too!"}
{"text":"MMMMMMMMMMMMM.... Do I really need to say more?!  Seriously, this is the place to go if you are craving something usual with a twist.   Fried pickles are great, and any of the burger options are very good.  I personally love the Ding Dong Burger... it simply gives an amazing asian flair to an already good burger.   Also, if you are a corn-dog lover, then this is the place for you.  These aren't your standard, buy them frozen and in bulk, and we can can stick them in the deep fryer and hope they taste good, corn dogs.  These are GREAT corn dogs, with flavor in every bite, and blanketed in a great cornbread covering.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Well I had the \"Mammoth\" burger (2 patties) , \"West side style \" (Onions, chili, mustard and slaw).  I substituted sauerkraut for slaw. I also added pepper jack cheese.  The butger was good but I didn't like the chili so thats the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I had the Chili Cheese waffle fries. This is a meal in itself. I love the eclectic atmosphere and the service was top notch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Pinky's because of their feature on Triple D. The food was delicious as expected. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. We recommend the popcorn shrimp!"}
{"text":"Went to Pinky's for the first one off of Freedom/Morehead in 2013.  Was the best burger in Charlotte - possibly the best I've ever eaten. I traveled all around this area with old and new hotspots and while some came pretty close, Pinky's has a bar this just too high out of reach. I am so glad they have a location in Huntersville as the parking can be a challenge with the Freedom/Morehead location.   Pinky's has a fantastic variety of delicious food with a friendly staff in a fun atmosphere. This place is Charlotte at it's best - food, history and people all crammed into one place delivering above and beyond on quality and service on every single visit. Their awesome burgers, flavorful wings, appetizers, hushpuppies (crabpuppies) waffle fries(with or without being smothered with pimento cheese), you must try their sweet potato chips and wasabi ranch - so good :D. Oh and I just love the creativity in the names of their dishes and burger sizes. I've only lifted here for 15 years but get most of the references.  I've had about half of the items off their menu over the eyes and all have been fantastic but here is a picture of my usual - white trash burger."}
{"text":"I am so beyond glad that I finally made it to Pinky's to eat. I will be going back for sure. It's definitely bar type food, things like burgers and wings and fries. No complaints from me though.  I was surprised by the number of vegetarian options they had on the menu, not only do they have a veggie burger but also veggie hotdogs and corndogs! I had the corndog and was super happy with it. My husband had the veggie dog with vegetarian chili and was over the moon. We started off with the fried pickles for the table as well and they are chips which I always enjoy. All in all I can't wait for my next visit, I feel that they will be satisfying a lot of my cravings here!"}
{"text":"After walking around in the heat all day at the Renaissance Festival, my boyfriend and I were looking for a nice place to have a cold beer, delicious food, and someplace that wouldn't break the bank. We most definitely found it at Pinky's Westside Grill. I was slightly apprehensive based on the other reviews given, but decided to give it a chance since all of the surrounding restaurant entrees started around $15.   The food was undeniably delightful and the waitstaff was so helpful and kind. They serve their meals in paper trays and plastic ware is used. It didn't bother me one bit, because the taste of the food made you forget about what it was being served on. I had the Green Chile Pork sandwich and my boyfriend had the Fish Sandwich, both of which were incredible! Everything comes a la carte, but the prices are beyond reasonable.   I will definitely visit again when I'm in the area. No complaints here!!"}
{"text":"I loved it , will be back for more ! Great food , fast service , good prices , interesting menu !!!"}
{"text":"Living in Huntersville for 18 months and pass by this place everyday. We never went in, I guess because of the appearance. From the outside we saw video machines and pretty terrible decor. The menu is quite different and refreshing. There is a variety of apps, sandwiches, burgers and drinks I've never seen before.  The service was actually 5 Star- all the servers were very pleasant and efficient. My wife ordered pork tacos and loved them. She commented numerous times it was to much and commenced to eat them all. I had a Patsy Melt(patty melt) and waffle fries. They were prepared well but not hot. I didn't want to complain and ate them. That's on me! When we do go again I will send anything back that's cold. The servers were all attentive, all asked if all was ok, even if they weren't ours.  It's hard for me to give this place 4 stars because the food is kinda basic (meaning not gourmet dishes) and the food was served in baskets with plastic utensils. Good place for a cheap different meal."}
{"text":"Fried pickles......   I debated only writing that because any place that serves this delicious dish always has my heart.... so naturally I'm going to tell you to order fried pickles...but wait there's more!!!  Pinky's is an awesome little burger joint and you can't go wrong with any thing you order. The white trash burger is golden and of course it has fried pickles on it!!!!!!!   If you're trying to be healthier go for the tahini salad. It's delicious and the falafel is cooked perfect.   Also this is a great little late night place to avoid the uptown rush- cocktails are $5-7 and they're huge. Most of them are served in a mason jar. You can also upgrade to a double for a few bucks extra. Ps. The Squirrely temple is great!!!!"}
{"text":"Slipping a bit.  I've eaten here four or five times now and in general, it's pretty good. Very creative menu, good service, nice atmosphere and in general, the food has always been good.  Until today that is.  My wife and I were out shopping and ended up at Pinky's in Huntersville. She ordered the Ding Dong Chicken which is a Thai inspired Chicken Sandwich with Peanut Butter and Sriracha Sauce without the Sriracha Sauce and Sweet Potato Fries on the side.  She really enjoyed her meal.  Normally I'll go with the White Trash Burger or the Fish Taco's but today went for the Popcorn Chicken Basket and a side of Waffle Fries.  Chicken was grossly overcooked with no moisture at all and the Waffle Fries were undercooked with the consistency and taste of cardboard.  Service was still outstanding but did not make up for a very lackluster meal.  We will be back because of past experiences here and because every place has an occassional off day. Next time, I'll stick with the Burgers or Fish Taco's."}
{"text":"It's a diner.  You get diner food.  When my friend suggested it, I was hesitant.  Diners don't tend to be vegetarian friendly.  (Especially in the South?)   This one is.  When I checked the menu, I was delighted to find that it is vast and full of vegetarian choices. No veggie ghetto, here.  Everything was tasty and portions were substantial. Servers were friendly and attentive without hovering.    I look forward to going again."}
{"text":"This is our first time at Pinky's and we're already planning to go back!  Definitely a unique restaurant.  I want to try pretty much everything on the menu but since we're only in town for 3 more days so it's sad to say that I won't get to try everything.  As for today, I got 2 buffalo shrimp tacos recommended by our server.  The overall experience was great.  I love the food and the service.  There was no complain at all."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger in the area! Food is awesome and the service is great! They often have great specials you wouldn't expect from a burger place! It's worth the visit!"}
{"text":"It's like diner meets bar food with a dash of pink. Other than having to park across the street I really have nothing bad to say about Pinky's. I got the falafel with fresh jalopenos which was wrapped in a big pita and pretty tastey. I tried my friends buffalo shrimp tacos, now I'm a taco lover, but these didn't quite do it for me, I think it was the blue cheese that turned me off. Moderately priced food and drinks, fairly good service, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everyone's your waiter here.  The portions are fairly big for the price that you're paying, but watch out, pretty much everything is À la carte.  The nila wafer nana pudding is THE BEST."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place for lunch because I'd good things about it, especially about the crab hush puppies! Finding a parking spot was much harder than expected during the lunch rush. Even with the parking lot across the street there are not enough spots for everyone to park, along with trying to run across the street once you finally get a spot.  Walked inside and even though it was really busy, I got a seat at the bar pretty fast. Looking at the menu this is definitely not the place to go for the health conscious! Of course that's never deterred me before so I proceeded to order the crab puppies and a veggie dog. The hush puppies are amazing! Moist inside with big chunks of crab and a hot crisp layer of fried goodness on the outside that soaks up the wonderful tartar sauce. I could not get enough of these things! The veggie dog was also much better than I expected, it came with vegetarian chili and slaw and tasted almost like the real thing.  The crowd here is very friendly as well drawing in a nice variety of people from business men to bikers and families. The waiters and host were very nice and accommodating, one even opened the door for me when I was walking in. Sitting at the bar I had a fun conversation with an eclectic gentleman about how he thought we were too connected to each other these days with our fancy cell phones and gadgets.  You'll probably get a heart attack if you eat here too often, but you'll be happy doing it! As for me I'll have to plan visits here around trips to the gym so I can have some guilt free crab hush puppies."}
{"text":"Food is good. The customer service is exceptionally good. The staff works as a team to satisfy you. They are attentive to your drink refill, clearing your table of things you are no longer eating, etc.... It is rare to see it at the level that they do it. Only downside is parking. It is very tight and skimpy.   And not really a downside, I'm just into heavy metal music. It was constant and loud the whole time we were there. It was difficult to hold a conversation with the people you are enjoying your meal with."}
{"text":"For this review its actually 4.5 stars.  Service was great!  This place had a great vibe. At 3pm on a Saturday afternoon there was a wait but we were lucky and found two great spots at the bar.  I ordered the strawberry basil lemonade made with gin and my husband got a beer. My drink 5/5 perfect for the hot humid day.  We preceded with the burger featured on diners drive ins and dives...forget the name but Asian pork burger with Asian sweet sauce and cole slaw. I gave it a 4/5 but my husband gave it 3/5. It had a unique flavor and definitely wasn't traditional. Fried pickles 5/5 yummy!!!!!! Pimp'n fries with added bacon 4/5 I wish they had more cheese. As stated before service was great! We actually saw the owner present recognized him from the TV show diners drive ins and dives. All staff seem to actually enjoy their jobs which in my opinion sets the tone for the dining experience.  Wish we had something like this in Las Vegas!  Recommend this place to others for sure!"}
{"text":"I live really close by and initially became a patron due to the proximity but since then I've become a regular because of the great food, super staff and the cool decor.  The restaurant is in an oddball location with some goofy parking options but when you get inside you're seated fairly fast and the food comes in fast as well since they don't use fancy plates or cups.   Always some drink specials, cheap beer options available. And the food comes in ballpark style paper containers. The pimento cheese fries, the nature boy white trash style and the shrimp tacos as my favorite!   Go check it out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere! So happy they had the vegan Beyond Burger on the menu. My parents and boyfriend were able to enjoy some true grill food and I still got to enjoy a burger as well. We also got the fries with vegan chili on it - they were a hit all around."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The staff are the best staff I've ever encountered. I got my food to go but picking up my order was the best part. I ordered the Pimp'n fries with chili, cheese & bacon, Viking corn dog, & Spaugh buffalo wings. Everything was delicious. I did ask for my wings to be extra crispy in which they weren't but they were still good. I highly recommend this place if you're driving through or in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"We came here cause of DDD. My husband got the white trash burger and I got burger ding dong style. At first I was skeptical because it had Coke slaw, peanut butter and sriracha sauce in it but it was actually really good.  The prices are very reasonable for the food.  We also got the chili fries and they were amazing. We both would definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone looking for a good burger."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Greg has done an amazing job! The service is always great! Super friendly, attentive, and the food comes out in a timely manner. It's an awesome vibe and we love to visit often."}
{"text":"I don't watch Triple D. I barely know anything about Guy Fieri other than the fact that he looks like a pro-wrestling 2000's raver. That being said, Pinky's just seems like the type of place that he would go to flavortown at. It's cheap, gimmicky, and an extremely popular place to dine whether you're a tourist or a local.   There's a bunch of fun menu items like Crab Puppies and Corn Dog Shrimp while the White Trash burger and the Toney Baloney are a pretty accurate representation of what the sandwich menu looks like. I had the Kickin' Chicken tacos and they were definitely pretty tasty although they were on of the more boring things I could have ordered.   They do something here called Ding Dong Style which is the combination of crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw, and hot sriracha sauce to top a burger or tacos. It wasn't exactly my thing, but I gotta applaud a place that's willing to take a chance on an unlikely combo.   Considering the dirt cheap price tag and the entertaining environment I'd definitely give Pinky's another go if I'm in this part of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came here (Huntersville) for my husband's birthday.  Delicious food, wonderful service.  They have a team approach to serving so whomever walks by your table, checks in to make sure you don't need anything.  Burgers taste like they were made in my house in my kitchen.  AND he got free dessert because it was his birthday."}
{"text":"Enjoy the margarita pitchers and the fried pickles! The corn dog shrimp is good as well"}
{"text":"What a amazing place to sit and have a cocktail or some tasty food. Amazing service along with great atmosphere. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Wow - pimento cheese burger, pimento cheese fries, $6 pitchers of beer. GO HERE NOW, don't walk, but run, fast! I am going back to try the peanut butter burger, my friend had it and he said it was awesome!!!  Kid friendly and fun decor!"}
{"text":"This place is the best for some fast/casual dining. The staff is very attentive and friendly. They won't seat you until your whole party is there because they turn tables very quickly. All the burgers are great go-tos for me but definitely try the tacos too because they are delicious. On warm days they have an excellent patio where you can have one of their amazing signature cocktails."}
{"text":"Falafel salad was very bland and seemed old.  Not the greatest place to take a group with several kids and elderly people.  Very busy lunch rush.  Heard somebody in the kitchen verbally yell at waiter for taking wrong order to table.  Very embarrassing.  Will return alone and try burger."}
{"text":"Down and dirty (my term, this place is not dirty folks). place but with a great service team.   Same uniqueness as charlotte location but made for the suburbs.  $5 margaritas are good and beer specials are great.  Onions rings are tasty mugs.    I think the wait staff combined might set a world record for the most tattoos on a wait staff, sorry folks...just not into that stuff, so I knocked the star rating down for this reason.  The tattooed staff is wonderful folks, there humans too!"}
{"text":"If I could give a 3.5, I would, but since I'm an optimist, I gave 4 stars. :)  Pros: Great atmosphere, interesting menu of items, and really good as far as price goes.   Cons: Nothing too negative - food was alright.   We had the White Trash Burger, which was alright, but I was expecting something a little more \"wow\" worthy from the reviews. The pimp'n fries were a treat especially with some ranch, and I do want to come back to try the Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich! It sounds delicious!  I'll give it another shot, but I have plenty more places I want to check out in Charlotte before I make my way back."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Pinky's last night and we really enjoyed the atmosphere. My only complaint about the restaurant itself is that the music is really loud, and given the theme and the \"feel\" of the place, it's understandable. But we were sitting at a table for 2, not very far apart from each other, and we were practically yelling. The other small issue I had was....who was our server? We had 4 different people come to our table refilling our drinks, taking our orders, and giving us the bill. I appreciate not having to wait, but when it came time for them to take my card, no one was around. So I ended up leaving cash and we left. But the food was delicious. I ordered the buffalo shrimp tacos w/ arugula & Gorgonzola and a salad instead of black beans. The salad was a huge portion (not a problem) and reasonably priced, as were the (2) tacos I got. There was also the option of getting (3) tacos for a small up-charge. My friend got the (2) fish tacos and they were huge! So overall, we were very impressed with everything and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, awesome customer service. Marney (sp?) was our waitress. If you can get put in her area, you won't be disappointed with your experience. The manager even came out to check on our experience as first timers. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"It's an ok place to go, especially if you want to have vegetarian options.  Food has sometimes been a 4, sometimes a 2.  Same for the service.  Portions are large though, which is nice."}
{"text":"the estimated wait time was half of actual and other than coming to take our order and deliver food the servers did not even once come by the table to check on us or refill drinks or ask how the food was. In fact when the food was delivered we asked if the fries could be done a little crispier which is how we ordered them but the guy basically said no, clearly not looking to please.  I had to get up and find someone if we wanted anything and also when it was time to pay the bill. The food was ok but nothing special, if they had actually made it as we ordered it or attempted to fix it I think that would have earned this place in overall 2 stars but given the horrible service there is no way this place is better than two stars."}
{"text":"I brought my mom here for lunch and we were less than impressed. The staff was NOT pleasant and made us feel like we were a nuisance. The restaurant had a dirty, greasy feeling (so appetizing ). Our table was not clean and our hostess did not offer to come back and wipe down the table or seats.   My mom and I proceeded to order and we have both had better. Their burgers and overly battered and fried toppings were unimpressive. I would rather have Wendy's. It may be a good place for 2 am munchies, but I recommend saving your money and grabbing a burger elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had some friends in town this weekend , which resulted in us all being hungover on Sunday needing something greasy that we could pickup. Pinkys happens to be right down the street from my new house so we decided to give it a shot. Like how bad can something be if Guy Fieri's into it , right?   I pulled up to pinkys which is actually decorated pretty cool both inside and out. Was kinda bummed we got it to go as it seemed like a cool spot to grab a burger and a beer. Decor , fun environment , and seemed to be pretty good happy hour options is where a lot of my allocated stars are going.   The food however left something to be desired. I ordered the garlic lime chicken tacos , and upon taking my first bite noticed I had in fact received buffalo shrimp tacos. Being the lazy host who picked the closest place to my house for pickup , I decided not to say anything. Im just going to eat these shrimp tacos , but I couldn't t. There was entirely too much buffalo sauce , the shrimp were undercooked very chewy , and cold inside. I thought it was in my best interest to throw them out. I  wasn't furious because I also ordered the crab hushpuppies , which were actually pretty solid , and I would recommend. One of my guest got the mammoth burger , which didn't have any of the condiments or  toppings he requested but he did say it was a pretty good burger.  He ordered a side onion rings to share , which were kind of like shoe string onion rings. I feel like they would have been pretty good if they weren't so cold and soggy. One guest ordered the fish tacos , which he said tasted like captain ds. I have never been to Captain Ds so I'm still uncertain if this was a good or bad thing , I didn't ask him to elaborate because I didn't wanna look like a nerd for never getting captain ds. We also got the corn dog shrimp to share , which were by far the best corn dog shrimp I've ever had but also the only.   I apologize for the monster previous paragraph , if anybody's still here I would recommend If you're getting it to go , I would at least checking your food before you leave. Lets face it , to go food is never as good as dine in food (excludes Chinese). I will probably give Pinkys another shot because its a mile from my house and some of the stuff was good , but I will be dining in."}
{"text":"Only redeeming quality is the price.  ordered a chili dog, corndog, fried pickles, hushpuppies, and the shrimp corndog things and 2 drinks. total came out to about $42 with tip.  overall everything was pretty \"meh\", with my wifes corndog shrimp being partially uncooked. I would say that anything on this menu could easily be cooked by anyone with any small amount of skill in the kitchen and taste at least the same if not only slightly worse. corn dog, was.. a corn dog. hot dog had a very low quality, bleh, chili. Hushpuppies were very grainy   and bland, probably would have held up better with a bbq sauce dip or something like that. fried pickles were good.  wouldnt come back here or advise anyone to visit unless theyre a fan of subpar american food."}
{"text":"Pinky's rocks. Definitely recommend the Nature Boy (veganized = no cheese, no mayo, on pita). But i also recommend the veggie chili (vegan) and red potato salad (also vegan). The falafel ain't too shabby either.   Might as well come on a Tuesday night because all of their drafts are $2.50 and I believe they were all local Charlotte drafts to boot. Had a Lennyboy Burn Down Brown and Birdsong Higher Ground for $2.50 each. A steal. On Friday night, they do craft beer roulette. For $3, they bring you whatever craft bottle they want which is kind of fun.   With Wesley Heights being my future hood, Pinky's will likely be seeing me much more frequently."}
{"text":"Why start a diet on Friday?  Especially since I have never been to Pinky's and Pinky's has so much that I like:  Fried Pickles,  Hot Chip's (not the dancers) made to order (these are the thinnest and Best Potato Chips I have ever eaten), Onion Rings (sliced very thin and very lightly battered), Hot Dogs made to order (he wrote it down and they executed it perfectly - no slaw, light on the chili, super light on the mustard, 100% Beef frank, heavy on the ONION), Fried Squash, Cheerwine Cake, Sunkist Cake.  Team oriented staff took very good care of me (yeah  was alone and ate it all - if you think I'm a pig consider this...  Before arriving at Pinky's I ate a full lunch at 1:00pm and I got here at 2:00pm so uuuhhhh - I'm not a pig I'm a wild Boar.  Sweet Tarts for dinner!    What would I recommend?  Bring at least three people with you so you can have a taste of everything or just invite me and you'll be able to maintain your diet because I will eat it all!  I haven't finished with their menu yet!  When I go back I will get the sweet potato fries, repeat the onion rings and chips and check out something else.  The Cheerwine Cake I do recommend the Sunkist cake was good though not my preference.  Would definitely repeat the hot dog, maybe the fried pickles, though not the fried squash.  If you are a fan of Grease (not the movie) you may find Pinky's slightly on the light side.  Though plenty greasy for me it was not as greasy as I imagined!  If I say \"the diet starts Monday\" will you read my reviews for Monday, cause I'm going out and I doubt there will be any restraint!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite dive bar.  The bartenders are AWESOME, especially JesKa.  The banana pudding is delicious.  I love how great the food is at such a low cost.  It is within walking distance of my home.  I love the new patio for summer time alfresco dining."}
{"text":"Prepare yourself for a food coma. Trust me, it's going to happen.  During our weekend trip to Charlotte, we decided to try Pinky's after seeing all the pictures of the pimpin' cheese fries on yelp. It also didn't hurt that this restaurant was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. We arrived around 12PM on a Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table. But the place was pretty full.  All the food we had was really good. I was dying to try the pimpin' fries and the crab puppies more than anything else. And since we knew those 2 appetizers were going to be a lot of food already, we opted to getting just one of the Pinky's dogs and sharing the 3 dishes between the 2 of us. We added the bacon to the pimpin' fries and these were sooooo delicious. You get your money's worth with the bacon and surprisingly, the waffle fries never got soggy despite the amount of cheese and bacon on them. The crab puppies were also amazing and came out really fresh. These will fill you up super fast though and we couldn't finish all of them. The Pinky Dog was good, but honestly I couldn't taste much of the pimento cheese since the chili overpowered it a bit. But it is still a really good dog!   As for the service, they were amazing! We had a handful of different people serving us. They all made sure our water was refilled before it even got halfway empty. And the food also came out really fast. It seems like this would be a good place to come have a few drinks and just nosh on some killer appetizers. They have a pretty cool bar and the décor gives it a great  vibe. I will definitely come back, because I want to try the corn dog battered shrimp that was featured on DDD!  Tip: Parking is behind/to the side of the restaurant. So don't freak out if you don't see an empty spot right in front."}
{"text":"The burgers and cocktails here are truly great! I highly recommend checking this place out, especially considering the very reasonable pricing. The menu has a wide variety of burgers, salads, etc. It has a nice neighborhood feel to it and comfortable vibe. The environment was a little loud for my taste but the food and drinks were amazing!"}
{"text":"A fun diner with great atmosphere. Food was good, but not quite the \"Triple D\" experience I was thinking it would be. None the less I can't wait to get back with the grandkids. They'll love the dinosaur out front and the VW on the roof."}
{"text":"The real reason we finally made it to Pinkys.... Pimpin fries, aka pimento cheese waffle fries! We added veggie chili per a recommendation and we're glad we did. They were everything we hoped they would be and will be back when the craving strikes.   This place was much smaller than expected but had a very fun relaxed decor. Prices were very reasonable and consistent with the plastic plates and cutlery. I had the vegetarian burger and it was alright, kind of lacking in flavor. My fiancé had the kinda fried turkey sandwich and really enjoyed it. We also had the honey cilantro slaw which was delicious. Next time I might just have to get an order of fries and slaw all to my self and call it a meal!"}
{"text":"I have only had the opportunity to eat here a couple times but it is on the top of the list for places to go back to.  Last time I went I had the Pimp'n Fries which is their homemade pimento cheese melted over crispy seasoned waffle fries and of course had to add bacon with a side a ranch. When you go here these are a must order. I also had a corndog that was the bomb and a couple bites of the Da Pimp which is a pimento grilled cheese, fantastic.  I can't wait to get back here with a bigger appetite so I can get one of their burgers that all sounded so delicious."}
{"text":"I can't believe I used to work just a couple miles from this place and never tried it.  I finally gave it a shot yesterday.  I will definitely be back!  The atmosphere was noisy and lively, but not so much so that we couldn't have a conversation.  I enjoyed they wide variety of music playing (I heard everything from Michael Jackson to Iron Maiden to Jay-Z).  There was a pretty good Friday beer special called the \"Craft Beer Roulette\" where you get a randomly selected craft bottle for $3.  I paired that up with a pterodactyl burger.  I got it ding dong style, which includes slaw and crunchy peanut butter.  I was intrigued by the idea of a burger with peanut butter on it, and was not let down.  It was awesome!  The only reason I couldn't give this place 5 stars was the service.  We had no fewer than 4 of the wait staff stop by at various times during the meal so it was really unclear who was our primary server, and there were a few instances where we needed things and couldn't get the attention of any of them.  But the shaky service one this one occasion is not enough to keep me from going back.  All in all, it was a great experience and I absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, greasy, delicious burger."}
{"text":"It's Pinky's. It's fun, quirky and kind of bad for you but that's what makes it good. You can't go wrong here. It's all yum!"}
{"text":"Pickys with our grill is always a pleasure. The staff are friendly professional and outgoing. I've been going for a couple years and have never been disappointed. They always work as a team each taking the time to stop by the tables ask if there's anything else needed. My glasses is never empty and I always have someone taking great care of me."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday for lunch around 12:30.  Short wait for a table. Place was hopping. Hip decor, great menu. Had the uptown tuna melt and sweet potato fries. I could not eat the fries fast enough. They were awesome. Sandwich too really. Topped it off with banana pudding. Nice meal."}
{"text":"Pinkys is always awesome. Our go to for the most comfortable comfort food. Yum to the pimento cheese fries and the white trash burger we devoured. The constant stopping by various servers is confusing as they all work together but we dealt with it as two of the guys were easy on the eyes. Stop at our table anytime boys but bring by some fried pickles and a mimosa when you come!"}
{"text":"Don't shoot the reviewer but I wasn't that impressed with Pinky's.  It wasn't a bad experience but it wasn't fantastic.  First, I can see why Pinky's had to place a car on their roof, there is just nowhere to park your damn car!  Thankfully, we noticed a sign that pointed to a lot across the street for Pinky's patrons.  Once we got in, it was slammed; however, duly noted is its small size, so slammed is relative. In any case, we got a small bar top table just big enough for 2 people.  The weird thing is that we literally had about 4 different servers.  I think it was technically a \"pick-up\" table (for those of you who serve) but a waitress came over, and then a bartender, and then another bartender, and then a different waitress.  I really have no idea what was going on. The plus is that we never needed to ask for refills!  The menu, in theory, looked amazing.  I love the cool titles and the unique items offered.  Who can't laugh at a \"Weiner Wonderland\" section?  I just found my food to be mediocre.  Everything seemed very fried.  It was almost an artery overload that made me feel a bit nauseous.  I have mixed feelings about returning but will be open to reading future reviews that may change my mind!"}
{"text":"We shared Green Chile Pork sandwich and Ding Dong Chicken sandwich. Strongly recommended. It is such a creative combination of ingredients, the pork sandwich completely blew my mind. Will definitely go back, and will try cocktails next time."}
{"text":"Home of Charlotte's one and only veggie corn dog!  And, it's a really good veggie corn dog to boot.  I'm not a vegetarian but definitely prefer veggie hot dogs to real hot dogs (for nutrition reasons, not taste).  I have ordered their veggie hot dog with veggie chili as well and often crave it.  So, needless to say yesterday when I visited, it was a tough decision between the new corn dog or the chili hot dog.  I wasn't disappointed.  I also had their homemade slaw (delicious!) and their appetizer order of hush puppies (a HUGE order for under $3 and they were mouthwatering with the tarter sauce).  Mmmm!  Next time I want to try the waffle fries with chili and cheese (duh, of course).    The location is the only real downside to this joint.  It borders a not-so-great part of town so I will probably only visit this place for lunch.  There's plenty of parking across the street so don't be fooled by the small lot.  The inside is funky and fun and the staff is cool.  All in all, it's a fun place to eat and it helps that the food is good."}
{"text":"Pinky's is one of those places that I have been to so many times and just never got around to reviewing. I think that part of the reason for that is that there is no way to do it justice. This is probably my favorite burger spot in Charlotte. It used to be the Penguin, but that is no longer the case (a different story entirely).   Pinky's serves up a great burger at a great price. It also has a funky/eclectic atmosphere that keeps things interesting. I've tried just about every combination of the burger here and they all have their merits. My normal go to is the \"White Trash Burger\" which comes with fried pickles, onion rings, and spicy ranch. Another good option is getting a burger \"ding dong\" style. This style consists of crunchy peanut butter, honey cilantro slaw and sriracha. I know this sounds odd, but this combination of flavors just works. I could go on and on about the burger, but I don't want to write a book here.   The appetizers/sides are just as good as the burgers. I would highly recommend the fried pickles, which are lightly breaded dill pickles that come with ranch. They come out hot and their is a big pile of them for just a couple of dollars. I would also recommend the Pimpin' Fries which are waffle fries smothered in pimento cheese. You can also add chili which just makes them all the more delicious. I know all of these things sound greasy and they are, but they are delicious. If you are looking for a healthier option, I've heard from many that their veggie dogs are some of the best.   The service at Pinky's is always friendly and efficient. I've never had too much of a problem with slow service, but they do tend to get very crowded. That being said, there is a good amount of seating, especially during the summer when the outside space can be utilized.   Pinky's is a great price and they run some good specials throughout the week. One that comes to mind is their craft beer special on Tuesdays that offer all drafts for $2.50. They have a pretty good beer selection, and they always have some local Charlotte brews on tap.   Parking is nearly impossible in their main lot, but there is overflow parking available across the street at the Dunkin' Donuts.   Pinky's is a funky local place that is great for residents and a great place to bring visitors to the area. The food is delicious, interesting, and cheap. It is a great place to grab lunch or a beer after work. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cold beer, great music, fun staff and good food. It's bar food, nothing too gastronomic, but it tastes great. I had the fish tacos. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Just ok...was expecting more from reviews and articles awarding it one of the top burger places in the area but wasn't impressed. Food was overly greasy and just ok. The inside of the place is interesting, definitely different. What I disliked the most was the style of service. Servers were great and nice but aren't assigned tables so you have 5 people trying to take your order and you get asked the same questions 5 times. It's good to be attentive but gets annoying when you're trying to enjoy your meal or talk with your table."}
{"text":"the service isn't all that great but the food is ANAZING except the fish...it has no flavor :/  but I recommend the naughty boy burger and pimento fries and sweet tea"}
{"text":"Penguin was good but this place takes it up a notch on every level. The seating is more comfortable. It is a bit quieter but still energetic. The pickles are better than the penguin and I used to eat there three times a week. The chili pork sandwich was great. I thought it was going to be pulled pork but it was like a pork chop on a bun. I got it with Saracha for a kick.  If you miss the penguin you will love this place!"}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING. The white trash burger was so fantastic and just the right amount of food for just the right price. Our particular server had a bad attitude, hence only the 4 stars, but another girl picked up our table and was ridiculously sweet and an all in all fantastic server. The servers' clothes are a little skimpy and it is partly a bar, so I wouldn't take small children here."}
{"text":"The crab puppies are the best hush puppies we've ever had.  You can't go to Pinky's without getting the Pimpin Fries and make sure you add chili....perfection!!!!  I had the white trash burger and it was good but not the best burger I've ever had.  My husband had the buffalo shrimp tacos and said they were good but not the best either.  So my advice...get all the appetizers because that's where their \"A\" game rests ;)"}
{"text":"Neat little location and pretty good atmosphere. It's definitely worth a try if you haven't been. They have a menu that's fairly traditional but, put their own spin on it. The price is about average for a burger joint. The fried pickles are excellent (I'm biased to places with fried pickles - even if you don't like pickles much - I still recommend trying them)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. Don't be scared away by the exterior or the neighborhood. The food and drinks are awesome. The burgers are amazing and so are most of the fried items. Get one of the uniquely named mixed drinks as you wait. Definitely worth checking out. Not the best place for healthy eaters and/or vegans/vegetarians."}
{"text":"This is the best place ever! The service, food and drinks (great daily specials, too) are delicious and in a casual, fun spot! I want to eat here every day. I wish they would grind their own beef, so I could have a burger cooked medium, but that's my only complaint. I also saw they are opening a new one off Gilead street, so they are spreading the love."}
{"text":"Great locations, extra parking is located behind the restaurant. This old garage body shop was converted to an restaurant, serving hot dogs like the viking corn dog, pinky and stray dog. The burgers ranged from the poor white trash to the jive turkey. Everyone raved about the PWT burger, and it lived up to every expectation. This burger is one of the BEST, I has fried pickles and onions. If you are smart don't share this burger. Also we ordered appetizers, the fried pickles and crab hush puppies. Both were GOOD, but that burger is and was the star of the show."}
{"text":"All the same great food of the West Morehead Pinky's location without as much charm. I love Pinky's and I am glad that they have a location close to where my wife and I have moved! Two of my favorite parts about Pinky's are the \"Ding-Dong Style\" (sriracha slaw w/ crunchy peanut butter) which you can add to any sandwich or hot dog, and the $3 roulette beer where the bartender just grabs a random beer out of the cooler. Always exciting, for better or for worse."}
{"text":"Pinky's is your prototypical dive bar/restaurant with fantastic food, great drinks, and grungy feel. They have all sorts of art, pictures, and random trinkets and such which adorn the walls, a pinball machine and claw grab game up front, and a great porch seating area which was just recently extended!  For food I will usually stick to something like a hot dog or burger, but you absolutely MUST get it \"ding-dong style\". Ding-dong style is adding crunchy peanut butter and a sriracha slaw. **MIND BLOWN**. They also have vegetarian options, if that's your thing. The Pimp'n fries are a good appetizer (waffle fries covered in pimento cheese) and they have killer sides from waffle fries and sweet potato fries to onion rings and cilantro-honey slaw.  As far as drinks so, I usually stick with the beer specials (I want to say $2 16oz-PBRs every day), but my wife and all my friends swear by the ginger margarita.  A definite must if you're looking for a place that pretty uniquely Charlotte."}
{"text":"Pinky's west side grill is the spot to go when you want to gorge yourself with classic American food (or have a cheat day). If you haven't tried the banana pudding you need to!"}
{"text":"This was one of the first places I tried when I moved to CLT. I honestly don't get the hype. I've been here several times trying to give it another chance. Maybe I'm not trying to right food, but everything I've had here has been greasy. I got the buffalo chicken salad the last time I was there and it was even greasy. My biggest gripe is with the tables though...the tables are SO STICKY, it's distracting. Every time I've been here I keep trying to wipe off the tables to avoid that sticky feeling all over my hands."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and awesome food. The staff are always friendly and helpful when I'm not sure what to order. The white trash burger and corndog shrimp are my favorite!    As far as parking, I always park in the lot across the street. There's only a handful of spaces in the actual parking lot of the restaurant and it's usually full when I arrive.   Overall, a great place to try if you haven't!"}
{"text":"I feel like this place is a bit overrated. There are so many great places in Charlotte to get a burger and other than the hype and to say you did, I can't figure out a reason why you'd want to eat here. It just want for me. Food is extra greasy, wait is typically long, and service is mediocre."}
{"text":"Pinky's is one of the places I can always depend on to delight my greasy food cravings.  Of course they do offer more healthy options like salads, and vegetarian sandwiches, but let's not kid ourselves, you go here for the YUMMY food... the not so good for you food.  My first trip I ordered the fried pickles, and the Tony Baloney.  I ordered it westside with chili, slaw, onions, and mustard.  It was decadent. I enjoyed every bite. The bologna is thick and meaty an the chili is made just right.  Of course, I had to eat it with a fork and knife becasue it was so messy.  The fried pickles, to me, were better than The Penguins. And, their ranch-- SO GOOD!!!  Our next trip we ordered the crab puppies- think moist, sweet hushpuppies wtih a slight crab taste. They were also cooked very well and delicious.  I ordered a hot dog all the way and a corn dog.  The hot dog was good, but the CORN DOG-- OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! It's not your typical pull out of the freezer corn dog. Its' hand breaded, and fried so that the hot dog and the breading are juicy and cooked perfectly golden.    We took a few friends, and they loved it so much, that they returned 3 days later with their whole office for a lunch.  If you haven't been, you must go! It's a crowd pleaser for sure."}
{"text":"We love this place. It was the first restaurant we visited when we moved to the area. We have never had a bad trip. The food always is awesome, service amazing, environment is funky. My daughter loves the Pinky Dog and the Unicorn drink. I love their Pimpin Fries and  White Trash Nature Boy. Totally recommend. It can get a little loud and sometimes you are sitting next to another table a little to close but if you time it right it's not to bad"}
{"text":"Back at it again! Last time I was here, it was definitely a couple of years ago... So this place definitely needs an update. When I came here this time. It was packed!! Friday, lunch time, ya know.   Anyways last time I went with some pimpin fries, and as an anniversary since the last time I was here I got it again with my parents. But the new thing I got instead of the mammoth burger was suggested by my fellow friend and yelper Mike. The Kinda Fried Turkey.  Ohhhhh Mike were you right!! That sandwich hit the spot. What the twist and makes this sandwich different was that basil. I think that's what made this sandwich for me. That fresh taste of that leaf mixed with the cheese and tomatoes, oh man! Good suggestion sir, good suggestion indeed.  The Pimpin Fries. It was a little different from the last time I had it. And boy was it better! It's now waffle fries as before it wasn't. Load that baby up with some chili and some bacon and you've got yourself a nice little artery blocking, but an amazing party in your mouth.   I'm definitely coming back to this place and trying some other menu items. But, definitely my default is going to be that Kinda Fried Turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"\"If it's funky, I'll find it\", says Guy Fieri. Well this place is funky and triple D found it.   Definitely one of the most unique restaurants in the Charlotte area. You'll definitely find originality here whether it be from the eclectic decor, oddly creative menu, or highly attentive staff.   Can't go wrong with anything on the menu, whether you chose a burger, app, or something as odd as corn dog shrimp? Trust me, it works. And the service here is always great. Gotta love an establishment that puts customers first!"}
{"text":"I can't express the joy I felt when I found out there's a restaurant in Charlotte at which I can actually BUY a vegetarian chili dog and corn dog. I love it! The food is predominantly fried and greasy, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I wouldn't go here if I were on a diet, or super often, but once in a while I need to get my greasy junk food on and my god do I love a good corndog.  Also, the coconut sake is SO YUM!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite burger joint in Charlotte... Maybe even better than the Penguin!!  What?? Did I say that out loud?  Just a GREAT place to chillax and enjoy!!  LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Pinky's specializes in bar food and burgers prepared with a twist from the standard presentation. If it's burgers or fried food you want this is the place. The menu at this location is identical to the original location and the fried pickles are still some of the best I've had.   The huntersville location is just getting on its feet but the food quality seems to be on par with the first location which means it's good solid food. That said, the service at a full lunch seating was spotty at best. It appears they are using a team service approach where anyone serves everyone.  The result on my first visit was more like everyone serves some of the tables but not all of the tables.   We were seated in the middle of the serving area which seemed to leave us at a disadvantage for follow up from a server. That said, I like Pinky's & I'll be back to  update the review. Hopefully they'll have their service links worked out soon."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5- It is worth mentioning that this place DOES offer vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options. I'm always on the lookout for these kinds of establishments due personal health issues so it's great that they offer a variety here.    So I've had the veggie burger twice before and the sauce the last time was a bit much for my taste but I also never eat spicy food at all. Other than that, I ate a perfect veggie burger with a gluten-free bun. As far as the bun goes, if you can live with eating gluten, eat a normal bun. If you have much experience with trying to find good gluten-free bread, you'll know what I mean when I say these buns are udi's shelf brand; aka dry as all get out. I will applaud the effort to make them less dry though because they put some butter (or something like that) and heated it up so it's not too terrible.    I guess I shouldn't complain much about this but I ordered a house margarita and it's pretty bad; it didn't have enough ice, it was really bitter (even more so than margaritas at a mexican restaurant), and I tried to put the salt around the rim in to make it better and that was a horrible idea, it got worse.  Venue: 3/5- Small, good for groups of 1-4. Pretty cool, punk rock atmosphere. The only issue I have is that the seats aren't super cozy to sit on and don't wear open-toed shoes; as soon as I tried to sit down I had a painful encounter with the metal, pointy table-stand.     *dress for the temperature outside as they don't have a ton of a/c (or heat for winter, if I'm remembering correctly).  Service: 5/5- I have never been unhappy when coming here. This is my third time in the restaurant and the waitors/waitresses are always just so nice, so friendly, and quite helpful."}
{"text":"This was the first time we ate at this restaurant.  My fries were cold and did not have salt.  They did have a gluten free bun for my wife.  I will give it another chance."}
{"text":"Didnt like at all. I ordered whats called the big john basically chicken breast sandwich. What came out was this thin flaky fish looking thing. I ask my server if that was right answering back like i was stupid he said yea. I tasted it nothing like chicken either, ive never seen a paper thin chicken breast. My wife and daughter both had some sort of burger they said it was just ok. Big shocker was when we got the bill almost 40 dollars, for 3 sandwiches and 3 teas thats just upsetting. I hope this place closes the more i think about it the madder i get. Just not good at all"}
{"text":"Always have great experience! I always sit at the bar, but the bartender is always amazing. The food and drinks are cheap, yet amazing!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Every waiter and waitress will serve you. Great stop for a great burger whether beef or turkey.   The fried squash is delicious.   Don't take my word for it. Go now!"}
{"text":"Service was garbage. I ordered some chicken sandwich with peanut butter and it was supposed to be Thai inspired. I love Thai it's one of my favorite kinds of food! However the peanut butter was absolute overkill and my sandwich was disgustingly sloppy. I'm not a fan of thrown together sandwiches that you need a knife and fork to eat. AND THE FRIES!!!! They were fried too hard to enjoy! Don't believe the hype! It's not that great! I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Friendly note: if you've never been here before, there is plenty of parking in the back. I would not even attempt parking in front (there are only a handful of spaces).  SERVICE: I have noticed that a lot of local places, especially the ones that have enjoyed some fame from being on a Food Network show, coast on their reputation and do not pay much attention to service. Pinky's is not like that. The server was friendly, the food came out quickly, my glass was refilled promptly, and it really seemed like the people working here enjoy it.  PRICE: I would say the prices here are about average. Don't expect to pay McDonald's prices (don't expect McDonald's food either), but you also won't be asked to spend an arm and a leg. Burgers and fries will set you back around $10.  FOOD: The menu is fairly diverse, while not being so large that newcomers have no idea what to order. There are plenty of burger options, plenty of side options, and plenty of other menu items for those not wanting a burger or wanting to change it up. I would highly suggest ordering an appetizer of fried pickles- they really are like nothing you've had before. The only menu item that I've had that I do not care for are the onion rings. They are very thin (\"horseshoe\" onion rings), which I do not care for. Everything else is great.  Pinky's is one of my go-to places for late night food in Charlotte. It's a Charlotte staple, and I would recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Simply awesome... We were only in town for one night (we've never been to Charlotte) and relied on yelp to guide us to some good eats! We could not have made a better choice in restaurants. Friendly and helpful staff, fun atmosphere and AMAZING food! Everything on the menu sounded sooo good! My husband, our two children and I all ordered the \"White Trash Burger\" and we all shared an order of pimento cheese fries. DELICIOUS! We will be back if we ever find ourselves in Charlotte, NC again."}
{"text":"5 Star service and atmosphere.  Just not for me.... Ding Dong Chicken tasted like Peanut Butter Chicken, absolutely no hint of Thai.  Just plain and boring......All meals served are served in a tiny tray that is awkward to eat out of.    The deal breaker and why I will not be back, everything is a la carte, making this bar food joint expensive, .50 for this 1.00 for that, it adds up.  Plus, no meals are served with fries or a side.  $2.50 for a small tray of waffle fries is a crime.  To be fair, my wife loved her fish sandwich.  She rated it a 8 out of 10 --- she eats fish sandwiches everywhere, she knows her sandwich."}
{"text":"My roommate and I went to Pinky's on a Sunday night at his suggestion. It wasn't too crowded, so we were seated and tended to immediately. The atmosphere is very welcoming and a little more intimate than a general sports bar, though it retains many of those qualities. We first split a large basket of fried pickles, which were excellent, but unless you're really into that sort of thing, the portion might be a little too large. We ended up boxing the leftovers. My roommate got a White Trash burger, which looked pretty great, and I got a double-pattied West Side burger, which had chili and mustard. We also each got waffle fries on the side, which were great. The burger's patties were slightly on the dry side, but the chili more than made up for that. Not having salt and pepper at the outdoor table was a bit of a challenge, but that too was easily fixed. All told, it was a great meal for a solid price, especially given the portions. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Ok. So I am giving this place 5 mainly because of one item. 2 words - PIMP'n FRIES! We (2 adults and 1 preteen boy) ordered these as an appetizer with pimento cheese and chili and we all loved them! My husband got the Pinky Dog and our son got popcorn chicken tossed in buffalo sauce. I got the Patti Melt and it was really good but our son's popcorn chicken was so good that I was a little envious. I got black beans as my side and they were SO good!"}
{"text":"I have dined there twice and the experience was awesome.  The food is great so was the service.  I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great prices, cool atmosphere, would definitely go back. Need to update merchandise for out-of-town customers that are looking for something cool."}
{"text":"Took the family to Pinkys around 5 on Saturday and we LOVED it! Service was friendly, inviting and very attentive to all customers. The atmosphere was inviting with music and good conversation with other customers and employees. The food was quick to the table and so good. We shared the waffle cut chilli & pimento cheese fries. The fries were crisp, the chilli was just the right consistency with a light spice & kiss of sweet which complements the creamy sharp cheddar bite of the pimento cheese. My wife had the patty melt; it was cooked perfectly with a good crisp crust from the flat top and gooey melting cheese. For her side she had the black beans and I must say these are a must have. Fresh, tender and sweet with a light spice, so good. My son had the popcorn chicken tossed in Buffalo sauce. The chicken was served in a very generous portion, big plump , juicy white meat with a light breading. He had enough for lunch after church the next day. I had the \"pinky dog\" which is an all beef dog served on a toasted bun with chilli and pimento cheese (refer to earlier in this post for details in chilli & cheese). With fountain drinks and tip we spent just under $50 so not bad. Was a great experience and excellent food, we definitely recommend it and will go back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Pinkys. I love the White Trash Burger and the Ding Dong sandwich. When I first had the ding dong, I was skeptical. Peanut butter combined with sriracha and cilantro? These three items were never meant to be said in the same sentence, yet somehow, they come together to create a sandwich that leaves you confused but satisfied at the same time. I would also recommend the fried pickles. One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Deliciousness in every way! The cocktails were creative and freshly house made and the servers were super attentive. My family(hubby and 3 kiddos under 12 years old) were fighting to devour the pimpin fries, after 30 minutes of arguing about not being hungry and ready to eat an early lunch, 11:00am en route from Rio.  We all took the servers' suggestions and ordered the ding dong chicken, white trash burgers and corn dogs for the two younger kids.  Wow! So glad we decided to eat an earlier lunch and the fuss was about the awesomeness of Pink's food and ambiance!"}
{"text":"I went here to pick up food as wife was sick  I ordered a double cheese burger and fries. She had just a cheese burger.  For desert we ordered the banana pudding. I picked up the order and first thing I noticed the banana pudding was not in the bag. The hamburgers are ok. The French fries were cold and they were just pieces of fries mostly crumbed pieces. They forgot catsup on my burger and hers was missing tomatoes.  I doubt very seriously I would go back."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant that was converted from a old auto garage & featured on DDD -- there is a lot more parking down Morehead (past Pinky's into a gravel area) but watch out for those potholes!  I got a Shirley Temple and the Corn Dog Shrimp basket -- there is a plentiful amount of salty waffle fries in the basket, and it's topped with amazing corn dog battered shrimp. Try the wasabi ranch -- it was pretty light and gave the fries and the shrimp a good spicy kick. The Shirley Temple was a good complement to the food -- sweet with a good pineapple taste.  The service was quick and easy and the food was amazing! I'm definitely putting this place on my rotation."}
{"text":"Our friends introduced us to Pinky's yesterday. We had seen it featured on drivers, diners, and dives, but had never visited. We arrived around 1 pm and of course it was packed. We waited maybe 10 minutes and were then seated outside. Beautiful day demanded an outdoor setting.   The menu has lots to offer, from unique burger and dig combinations, to substantial vegetarian substitutes. Usually I go for burgers, but this time I did the natures boy, a delicious, homemade veggie patty. I got it Westside, one of several topping combinations. We also ordered hush puppies and vegetarian cheddar chili fries. It was all awesome. The hush puppies are about twice the size of golf balls, the chili was well seasoned, and a perfect amount of cheese. The \"burger\" was perfectly prepared.   Given how busy they were, our service was excellent as was the food delivery time.   Overall, a great experience. Highly recommended if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We were really excited to finally eat at Pinky's.... unfortunately it never happened. We arrived with our dogs in tow thinking we would grab dinner and then head to Lucky Dog. Well that didn't go as planned. They don't allow dogs on their patio. I definitely understand this rule and I don't have a problem with it but I do have a problem with them not stating it on their site or Facebook. The majority of restaurants in Charlotte allow dogs and I was really surprised they didn't and didn't even have a sign posted on the door saying so. I'm giving two stars for lack of communication. I will update this review when we are able to come back without the pups."}
{"text":"Oh eM Gee what can I say. I fell in love, my 6 year old fell in love! Visiting Pinkys was the best decision of our spontaneous road trip to Charlotte, NC.  Recently, becoming a vegetarian in the past year (May 2017) it has been so annoying trying to eat out without eating the same stuff over and over and over again. There are not many restaurants that go out of there way to get creative and serve awesome and delicious food like Pinkys. They sure know how to make a carnivore and a vegetarian/ vegan happy while eating out together. My vegan chili dog was amazing its been three weeks and I still can taste it! It taste just like any other chili dog! I promise, I know this. The hush puppies are so good and they serve a ton! The beer selection was very good too! Very disappointed I was too stuffed to try dessert. But, when in Charlotte I will make sure to always stop at Pinkys.   Awesome decor and music selection by the way! Hey, would you consider opening a location in Atlanta, GA? ( Very big smile)"}
{"text":"Ive been going to pinkys since day one but tonight....I was blown away the staff was friendly the service was awesome, the food was good im at a loss of words! Thank you Stephanie, Carly and Ben"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food!  Definitely not your ordinary restaurant. Great combinations and excellent appetizers!  Try the crab puppies. My table ordered the pimpin fries and fried pickles. Extremely good!  We tried the white trash burger, redneck parm, and Pinky dog. All of them were excellent!"}
{"text":"We ended up at Pinky's since our inital restaurant/bar choice was crowded, but we weren't disappointed!  The food was tasty for diner style food. The menu was easy to read and featured different food offerings (Burgers in 3 sizes, Hot Dogs -Corn Dog or Rueben styled, Chicken or Burger Sandwiches with crunchy peanut butter topping)!   The three of us had 2 \"The Jive Turkey Burgers, a White Trash Burger and a Reuben Hot Dog (minus 1000 Island dressing & swiss cheese) and Sweet Potato Fries. It was $5 ABSOLUTE Night, so we had a few alcohol drinks too. The food was good tasting and we were pleased, but the best was saved for last....the dessert. We chosed the Banana Pudding over the \"Cherry Lemon Sundrop, Almond Confettie or Chocolate Swirl Cupcakes\" and we were DELIGHTED!!! The pudding was great and had a very homemade cold pudding taste (made with whopped cream) served in a stryfoam bowl.  Oh, I forgot to mention that all the plates, utensils or cups were either paper, stryfoam or plastic. No diswasher needed at this place, well at least not for the food unless it for the pots and pans!! Lol  I would come back, if only for the \"Banana Pudding\"!!! Smh/lol"}
{"text":"Today we visited Pinky's for lunch as we occasionally  do on the Sunday's that my husband works. It is one of the few areas on the Westside for us to enjoy a family meal while he is working. We arrived a little after Pinky's opened.  When we were greeted, we told the hostess that we had four in our group. She asked if everyone was here. I told her that my husband was on his way and would be arriving shortly. She said we would have to wait. I try to never use his job as an excuse or reason for anything. But as the place was filling up as it always does because it is a great restaurant; I let her know he was a police officer and was on a call and had limited time to eat. She again stated she couldn't seat us. I then said well then there are three of us and we were seated. We ordered our food and ordered for him so his food would be ready when he arrived. While waiting, our 10 year old noticed that there were several large tables being sat that only two or three in the party were preset.  I approached the hostess and asked her why this was. She got defensive and pointed to a sign stating the rule is the party isn't seated until everyone is preset. I asked why the large parties were different. She stated they were there when the restaurant opened. I let her know we were as well. When I asked her why she was dismissive to law enforcement, she ignored me and asked did I want to speak to a manager. I declined and let her know we would let the law enforcement and emergency services community be aware of this.  I know rules are rules and I want to follow those but how is this restaurant being consistent about their own policy. I would never have said anything.had they not broken their own policy. If you are going to have a rule, be consistent."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place considering there was a relation to my favorite place to get a burger (Penguin) but what I found was sub par food and long waiting times (For a Saturday night) My family and I waited for about 40 minutes in a cramped area to get seated. Because we had a child and needed to seat her at the end of the booth due to limited seating, we were seated in the back area near the old garage doors, where there was a draft. We all kept our puffy winter coats on as we ate our dinner.  We ordered fried pickles and burgers. The staff was attentive and kind, very on top of things so at the very least they deserve props for that, howeverThe food was not that good, way too greasy (It messed my stomach up and thats hard to do) the burgers tasted a bit off and the fried pickels were insanly greasy. The places wasn't really enjoyable enough for me to return.  The one other positve thing I can say is that they had a great beer selection, something for everyone."}
{"text":"Family was in town so we decided to try this place. Food was decent, had a monsterous burger, it was good, but nothing to write home about. Kids liked the corndog's and the wife liked her patsy melt.  2 star review is due to the terrible service. We placed our order and never saw our waitress again...No one came to check on if our food was good (which it wasn't) or see if we needed more water. Brother-in -law's sandwich was wrong, ordered drinks that just never came, multiple people sat with an empty water, even tho we asked for a refill when our food came.  The waitress that we were able to flag down was nice enough to take all the wrong or items we didn't receive off our bill, and bring us our corrected check. Mix the terrible service with the ok/ warmish food and add that the bill still came out to almost $100, I won't be returning. It's a disappointment that is for sure, really wanted to like this place seeing it is in our new neighborhood."}
{"text":"With lots of chain restaurants around this is definitely a link off for a good reason!  The options were unique but enough of them to fit the requests of the whole family. Service was great!  Restaurant ambiance has lots to talk about and a great vibe.   As travelers we'd definitely go again and if we lived closer we'd be regulars."}
{"text":"I have been craving a burger for a few weeks but not fast food or one of the chains. I've driven by Pinky's on the way to several appointments for work and finally had the opportunity to stop in. I ordered the Mammoth Ding Dong Style and sweet potato chips with wasabi ranch. It was delicious! I can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Was paying off a bet so I decided to take my friend here for lunch.   For those that haven't been, Pinky's occupies a restored car repair garage - has kind of a retro-Americana vibe but is also quite bright due to the lage windows. Seating is a bit tight, but overall it's a fun place.   The back story of Pinky's is the old chef from the Penguin (Greg) moved across town and opened Pinky's. As a result, some of the menu is a carryover from the beloved Penguin while other items are net new (especially the salads!). For example, the out-of-this-world friend pickles are here, as are the tasty burgers.   However, what sets Pinky's apart are the new food options - the funky burger combo's, the excellent hot dogs, and the cool vegan options (Falafel and Veggie Chili). On this visit I had a double Ding Dong burger - two 5 oz patties topped with chunky peanut butter, cole slaw and Sriracha sauce. Yes, it sounds like a weird combo, but is exceptionally tasty (think Pad Thai sauce on a burger).   My buddy had the Southern Chicken sandwich and gave it a thumbs up. Service was good, not fast but also not as inconsistent as others have found.   Overall this is a good option for those looking for a good burger, great sides and some solid items for the non-burger lover."}
{"text":"Had the Corn Dog Shrimp w/ Wasabi Mayo - SO SO SO GOOD! Too much food. Couldn't eat all the shrimp, had about 2 fries and 2 bites of the cole slaw. Also had Greg's pickles - loved these. Recommend the small for parties of 4 or less. Will go back again when in town!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best fried pickles in Charlotte. Everything on the menu is A+. The hand dipped corn dog is also a must try."}
{"text":"Fried pickles. White trash burger.  Perfection.  Pinky's has a really cool, fun vibe to it. There's a dinosaur on the front lawn, and friendly, tattooed staff inside.  I brought my mom here on her visit to Charlotte, as I had never tried it before.   Let's talk about fried pickles. I don't like pickles. But if you slice them like chips, and fry them, somehow I've found love.  These were perfectly done and crispy. And they came with a side of ranch.  The small is plenty for 2 people, trust me.  I got the pterodactyl burger with pimento cheese and my mom got the white trash burger.  Everything was fresh, quick and delicious. I'll definitely come back here. Probably sooner than my waistline would like."}
{"text":"Don't let the poorly written negative reviews stop you from giving this place a try! The service is awesome. Our server told us right off the bat that every server serves everyone.  No problem there.  No one was pushy. Our food came out quick despite the place being full. The Pinky Dog was fantastic as were the fried squash and black eyed pea salad. My boyfriend got the Mammoth Burger and potato salad and loved it.  The fried items are greasy but go to Five Guys and tell me the fries don't soak through the wax paper and bag!!! The prices are very reasonable.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Pinky's always has a friendly atmosphere and drinks that are even better. The food is great. The Charlotte themed menu items always make me smile. Spaugh wings win every time."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Pinky's Westside Grill you don't know what your missing! When I arrived I was warmly greeted and seated promptly! I ordered the nature boy burger ding song style without cheese and mayo with some hummus mixed in and I was blown away ! I also ordered the pinto bean salad that  was fantastic this place has a retro feel and is priced reasonably ! Check it out you won't be disappointed ! P.S. This place has ton of vegetarian options and almost anything can be made vegan by removing cheese or certain sauces!!"}
{"text":"I've gotta crush on Pinky's. The place is fun, colorful, loud, and provides delicious food! I checked this place thanks to a group co-worker lunch. Once we arrived (party of four), we were seated immediately and had our drink orders placed. Amidst our group, two had previously been to Pinky's and had plenty raves about the white trash burgers.   I decided to go with the Korean BBQ tacos served with black beans. I'm not sure why they include Korean in the description of the BBQ sauce? There was nothing specifically Korean-tasting about those tacos or sauce, however, they were delicious. The pork was tender and juicy and the sauce was sweet with a little tang. The portion of black beans is quite small but I found it to be just right as an accompaniment to the tacos.   My other coworker who had also never been to Pinky's ordered the corndog crusted shrimp and really enjoyed them! She said they were \"out of this world\" but found the fries to be lackluster.   Throughout our meal, we had a rotating list of servers who came to check in our meals, refresh our drinks and provide other odds & ends.  For my second visit to Pinky's, I called ahead for a to-go order. I decided on the popcorn chicken salad. Unfortunately, this time I was a little underwhelmed with my meal. I am not a fan of mixed greens in a salad and that was the base for this. I like more crunch in my lettuce and there was none to be found. However, the chicken was very yummy!   My overall opinion is to avoid the salads and go all the way with the burgers, tacos, and basket options. Pinky's is a fun spot for the family and/or friends!"}
{"text":"I was warned, so I can't really be mad at anyone but myself..... The hamburgers are served well done. And they mean it. So, I got exactly what I asked for, but I didn't finish it.  Everyone else in our group loved their orders... fried pickles, sweet potato fries, popcorn chicken, chicken sandwich, and hamburgers. If you like them well done, folks really like them. You have been warned. Yes, I will be back. There are many other items on the menu that are great!"}
{"text":"Great portions and burgers that can be customized. Normally seating is fast. They also have good drink specials through out the week."}
{"text":"This is a nice place. I want to love it but its just missing a few things. The gravel and dirt parking lot for starters. And then when you walk in you'll see its pretty small and cramped. The pictures and stuff hanging on the wall also make it feel more cramped. Its not a dinner place, so don't look for fancy decor and  stuff. The food is good. Nothing spectacular, but it's still really good. I suggest that you go there and see for yourself. It really depends on what king of person you are. I recommend sitting outside, but not if you're allergic to/ scared of bees. I think there might be a beehive somewhere in the plants or on the building. They may have gotten that resolved but it wasn't much of a problem. It wasn't a bad problem. About 4 bees, just annoying. The area is nice though and its still a pretty cool place to get lunch."}
{"text":"The price is reasonable, as for the food can't say the same. The white trash burger was over cooked and over rated. The corn dog shrimps is way over battered and the crab puppies was ok (they should call it hush puppies with a hint of crab meat). The service was slow for the little amount of people that were in there eating. Let's just say this was my 1st and last trip."}
{"text":"Yuck! Never been impressed! The burger was greasy.  The service was lacking. The atmosphere was a turn off too."}
{"text":"The food has been decent but nothing worth writing home about. The atmosphere is okay. The drunks at the bar that wandered around made it so the place was more of a dive bar with so-so food."}
{"text":"Staff was great, but the food was average. A place that doesn't ask how I want my burger cooked can't achieve four stars."}
{"text":"The only bad thing I can say about this place is the funky parking situation. However, once inside, the service is good and the food is great. You must try the crabpuppies. Everything I've had on the menu I have enjoyed. They usually have some good beer specials and featured cocktails that my wife enjoys as well."}
{"text":"Today's special was a Philly cheese steak. Being from Philly, I was skeptical. But it rivaled ones from up north. The staff is super friendly and everyone, including the chef, checked to make sure everything was perfect. It was!! Hope they keep it in the menu. Love their waffle fries too."}
{"text":"Pinky's is a hidden gem if you ask me! As many times as I've seen the building I didn't realize it was a restaurant haha. The car on the building is sweet. I got the chicken platter with the buffalo sauce?? Excellent stuff indeed. I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Intended to go to the original but it was packed so we end to the huntersville location and it did not disappoint. We were not able to sit on their patio due to a recent incident with dogs but they were willing to bring out our food to a table in front of another establishment. Awesome food"}
{"text":"Came here after a bad experience at another restaurant. The environment is very clean and I loved the decor. Our waitress was engaging and very nice. I had a White Trash Burger and it was mediocre. The waffle fries and hush puppies are really good."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service!! Tuna Melt delicious! Cilantro Honey Slaw also very good!  Hubby had the Mammoth Burgee and loved it!"}
{"text":"Wow!! What an experience! This place was great! Lives up to the Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives hype. I got the fried pickles (amazing) and the white trash burger (also amazing). Definitely recommend!!!!! What a cool place!"}
{"text":"Pros: Food is good! BUT our waitress oversold us on the \"tofurkey\" dog and it tasted like a regular plain Oscar Mayer dog. She called the soy dog a tofurkey dog.   Cons: Very poor customer service here. Waitress forgot to bring my drink order completely and never said anything, but instead, left without saying goodbye and had someone else take over her shift. Food server wasn't friendly at all. Don't get the \"tofurkey\" aka the soy dog!"}
{"text":"Check it out! Funky crazy delicious! Fish Tacos and Crab Puppies were excellent. Wait staff is friendly. Parking is tight. This is one of those places that has such a personality and it is so worth going!"}
{"text":"Nice memorabilia to take a walk down memory lane. Great food at a good price. Best of all, the service is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Love this place and really have no complaints. The service is good at both locations, and you are rarely left waiting on a refill. I like the corn dog shrimp the best and my mother and husband really love the crab balls. I haven't had anything here I didn't like. Definitely a place to check out if you are visiting Charlotte and like hip bar food and a good selection of beer."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I've since moved to NYC but I constantly think and miss this place (and that should say a lot because there are tons of places in New York!) Equal parts bar and restaurant, Pinkys has so many dope cocktails and eats. I always get a ridiculously annoying order: nature boy burger with veggie chilli, pimento cheese, onion rings and chipotle ranch and it is KILLER. Before I started eating meat again, all my carnivore friends were jealous of my burger bs theirs. Pinkys has plenty of vegetarian friendly options, too. Servers are always nice and the quality of food fits the bill."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Great burger fantastic corn dog.  Super service and wonderful prices.  Be back"}
{"text":"Amazing all way around. The white trash burger was unbelievable.  The bartenders are very friendly and its a wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was a great place!! We are so happy we came here. The food was GREAT but the service was really phenomenal. We were checked on by several different people-all very friendly, never low on our drinks, seated quickly, barely any wait time on food. Just a really great place. We are definitely adding it to our list of \"must go again\"."}
{"text":"I really like this spot. Its very small and most of the time packed. The white trash burger and fried pickles are very good. The wings are ok. The spicy ranch sauce that can come with it is awesome. The staff that works there is always friendly and full of good suggestions. I live around the corner so I will be trying different options."}
{"text":"This is what I call \"Good Grease\"!!! I absolutely love this place. It's located on a busy 4 way stop corner there is very little parking in the front, but a massive gravel/dirt lot in the back of the restaurant. When you walk in you immediately notice the slightly grungy look. I personally love it - it has a lot of character. The restaurant used to be a car repair shop and the old bones are visible from the outdoor space that has the original garage doors. The outdoor patio area is my favorite place to sit when it is busy. My husband likes to order the pterodactyl which is a burger ding dong style - which is a fresh burger patty with crunchy peanut butter , honey cilantro and siracha - sounds strange, but he says it's delicious! I love the falafel sandwich and I order it with homemade chips on the side and it comes with the most amazing homemade ranch dressing.  The food is inexpensive, delicious, and the whole restaurant is an experience worth checking out!"}
{"text":"You gotta love a restaurant with character and a story!  Remember the battle to save the beetle that went to city hall and was funded by neighbors who wanted to save the west side icon?  Painted red, white, and blue, the 1960's-era Volkswagen Beetle sits on the roof of a former car repair shop at the intersection of Morehead Street and Freedom Drive and is now home to Pinky's Westside Grill!  When we arrived there was a small wait. Since we prefer to sit at the bar we walked right in (HINT HINT).  Up at the bar there are a couple of TV's for game days.  No alcohol yet but they are apparently in works to have it soon.  We took the bartender's suggestions on our food order.  1) Ding Dong Chicken:  Thai inspired grilled marinated chicken breast served on a bun with crunchy peanut butter, sriracha sauce, and honey cilantro slaw.  Sounds odd and had he not recommended it we would have never ordered it.  Different but really good!  I recommend you trying it too.  2)  Fish Tacos:  Two beer battered tilapia tacos on flour tortillas with cilantro-honey slaw and spicy ranch, served with a side of black beans.  Fun place to experience!  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"They could be friendlier.  I got here right when they were opening on a weekday.  I had to get there early because of a doctor's appointment nearby.  When I went to the door, it was locked, and they had a chair wedged underneath it.  I pulled on the door and waited for them to open it.  When they did, I went in, they didn't greet me, smile, nothing.  They just turned their back to me and went about their business.  I walked past them and stood where a person normally would if they were waiting to be seated.  I turned to look back at the same staff that were annoyed that I was their first customer of the day, and said \"Can I just sit anywhere\"?  The beardy one mumbled \"yeah\", and I went to sit down at a 4 top table.  I was the only one in the restaurant.  Five seconds later, he ran over to say \"This place fills up fast, do you wanna sit at one of the smaller tables\"?  Ugh.  Not really, I don't want you to cram a party of four in beside me.  That's what I thought you meant by SIT ANYWHERE.  I got a Tyrannosaurus burger and fries.  Both were delicious, but the burger was smaller than I expected.  I got banana pudding for dessert to finish, and it was delicious and definitely homemade.  I had 4 or 5 different people visit my table to refill my drink, while I ate, so I never knew who my actual server was, and how to base my tip.  The beardy one that first greeted me helped the most, but he never smiled, nor said have a nice day.  Basic niceties, that's what this place is devoid of.  I will go back, because the food made up for the service, but if I am treated the same way, that'll be the last time.  I don't care if you're trying to be hipster, you come off like an a** in the process."}
{"text":"A friend of mine came in town and she wanted to eat some where that was fairly close to her accommodations.  We decided to go to Pinky's.  I am glad I did.  I ordered the \"White trash burger\" and she ordered the \"Veggie\" burger.  We were pleased.  I highly recommend this place.  The food is good and budget friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome food! But the staff were extremely rude. First the host wouldn't sit us because only 5 out of 6 of our party was here. I understand wanting the entire party to be present but felt he was extremely rude about the whole situation. So we decided to sit at the bar so we could start having drinks while we waited. The bar tender was even worse! She had a complete attitude to us the entire time for no good reason. We are paying customers and did not deserve to be treated so rudely. She slammed our condiments on the bar, seemed annoyed the entire time by our presence and was in general completely unpleasant. Her bad attitude completely ruined the mood and how good the food was. Pinkys should consider training their staff on customer service. That is a huge downfall of this potentially great restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are looking to fat boy it up- this is the spot to go!  Great atmosphere, burgers, fried food and a surprising (in a good way) amount of vegetarian options (veggie hot dog w/veggie chili is good even to meat lovers).  Everything is served al la carte and the prices encourage you to order a lot!  I def recommend the crab puppies (hushpuppies with crab) and the shrimp dog basket (jumbo shrimp fried like a corn dog).  If you are looking to go on the lighter side- the Ginger Tuna Salad has a fun Asian twist.  Added bonus- the drinks are dirt cheap.  Easy to see how this became a Charlotte staple!"}
{"text":"The first time we dined in at Pinkys, service and burgers were off the chain. We went right before 5 o'clock traffic hit, so it wasn't really packed. We got seated promptly on the patio, which had lots of fans! Made good for having a local canned beer, at half price! I got the mammoth w/ pepper jack & American, my other half got a triple w/ everything.. our burgers were a little ridiculous, but the best ridiculous way. However I will say, their onion rings are not onion rings. They're onion straws!   The other night I ordered through take out. Again, got the mammoth for the smoldering cheese but they put 2 kinds of the wrong cheese on my burger. I was pretty sad about it, but I will definitely be back for another dine in experience."}
{"text":"So I went here awhile back ago for the first time as a recommendation of my good friend Mike...after my first visit I wondered as to why I never had went to this place before. I drive past it all the time when I leave Uptown from work! Well I must say that I am glad that I have been there. The atmosphere is very unique. Its got an awesme raw kinda egde to it I think. The employees were very cool, and very helpful on the menu. I've had many things on there menu, but the best things I've had was the white trash burger! Nothing beats a juicey burger with provalone, fried pickles (YES FRIED PICKLES), crispy onion straws and spicey ranch! It was one of the tastiest burgers I've had. And I switched it up the last time that I was there...I got a white trash hot dog!!! Which was great too. Try it out....you'll love it! -SK"}
{"text":"Cool burger joint w a very nice staff with a rocker vibe. I've had the fries pickles, the ding-dong style chicken sandwich and the white trash burger all recompense by the staff and they were all great! Had some really good brews on tap for a cherry on top!"}
{"text":"This Pinky's is a lot bigger and nicer then the original, not that anything is wrong with the original in fact it's one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. The menu is the same and the staff is super friendly and attentive. They have daily specials and I'm yet to find anything on the menu I don't like. The ding dong chicken sandwich is my favorite and it's always fun explaining that one to a new comer! Only thing I'd like to see added is more beer on tap, I'm a porter/stout fan and they have none here but other then that this is a great addition to huntersville!"}
{"text":"One of my local favorites! The veggie chili is a must try whether your a vegetarian or not, I guarantee you'll enjoy it! They have a great selection for gluten free allergies, vegetarians and meat lovers! They always have delicious daily drink specials."}
{"text":"Pinky's on a Thursday afternoon for lunch always means a short wait but why not? It means $2.50 craft pints!   Today it was the Ding Dong Chicken, a thai inspired grilled, marinated chicken breast served on a bun with crunchy peanut butter, sriracha hot sauce and honey-cilantro slaw. Pimp'n Fries with homemade pimento cheese melted over crispy, seasoned waffle fries with chili ladled on top. Lightly battered and fried onion straws. Grilled Greek Pita with provolone & feta, tomatoes, black olives and oregano. House made Sweet Potato Chips served with fresh wasabi - ranch dressing.  And over a year later Pinky's is still...yes I said STILL... bad-ass-want-to-go-back delicious!"}
{"text":"We love Pinky's! Great vegetarian options. The gourmet veg hotdogs are amazing as is the veg chili. Cool atmosphere, great drink specials, and overall very reasonable pricing. This is our new favorite spot in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"If you were to do a \"gut bomb\" search on Google for Charlotte, Pinky's would not show up (I know, I checked). But it should. And I mean that as endearingly as possible.  Sparing you from the whole drama that was Pinky's, Penguin, Diamond, the menu has somewhat the same feel as The Penguin did with burgers, hotdogs, fried pickles and a few other things.  I ordered a burger with two patties and did not get a side since we were getting an appetizer (more on that in a bit). The burger was delicious!! I actually could not finish it because it was one of those really good greasy one that you know spoiled your workout on the first bite but is so good you don't care. I may have been a little weighed down already from our appetizers.  I normally don't do appetizers but my friends and I decided to split some fried pickles and the waitress convinced us to try some Pimp'n Fries. It seems like everyone in Charlotte does fried pickles these days but these were towards the top end as far as how good they were. HOWEVER, the Pimp'n Fries were unreal! They are waffle fries piled high with pimento cheese and chili. I have never been a huge pimento cheese fan but these were among the best appetizers I have ever had in my life. If I were you (and what I will do again), is go ahead and order a burger (maybe one patty for me next time) or sandwich or whatever, skip the side all together and then spilt the Pimp'n Fries with your table. Five grown men were able to be satisfied. I started off saying this place was a gut bomb. And it is. But it is worth every bite."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, very unique! Food was meh, not bad but not great. I would definitely try it again! Staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"What a gem! My boyfriend took me here for the first time the other day and I'm wondering how I've gone all these years and never made it in there! It has the feel of a restaurant/bar you would see in a movie but also makes you feel at home right away too. It has fun decor and the service was prompt even though they were really busy. Parking is limited so it seems a lot of people walk to get there. The white trash burger was delicious and so was my boyfriends jive turkey sandwich. They have a veggie burger option which is next on my list for sure. They also have great weekly drink specials and patio seating although I'm not sure if it was dog friendly or not. Great experience would definitely recommend it and will be back soon myself!"}
{"text":"Ahh, Pinky's.   Upon moving to the Charlotte area for the summer, my roommates and I set out to find a one-of-a-kind restaurant in the area to try out. After doing a little searching online, we settled on Pinky's and headed over to try it out.  Before I delve any deeper into this review, I have a bone to pick. There are those of you who claim that the food here is \"too fried\" or leaves you feeling sick after. This is not a healthy restaurant. You don't come to Pinky's to get a little foo-foo salad with your foo-foo strawberry balsalmic dressing and a side of foo-foo fruit. And Pinky's doesn't try to sell themselves as that kind of restaurant. With that being said, here we go.  Pinky's is terrific. You would be hard pressed to find a restaurant in Charlotte that has the kind of character and atmosphere as Pinky's. My favorite time to visit is later in the night during the summer, when it's cool enough to sit outside. It's the perfect place to sit down and enjoy a few beers and laughs with friends.  Every time I come, we always start out with an order of the pimento cheese fries to share. Yes, you heard me correctly. These are greasy, pipin' hot french fries smothered in that scrumptious pimento cheese Southerners die for. Now, I have some health conscious friends, but let me tell you that everytime we order these, it's a full-out brawl as people fight to get the last few bites. These are a must-try appetizer, and if you're feeling extra ambitious, you can add bacon and chilli.   After gorging myself with the pimento fries, I ordered the White Trash Burger. Loaded with fried pickles, onion rings, and provolone cheese, and topped off with spicy ranch, this burger isn't for the faint of heart. Just a warning...your waiter might try to persuade you into adding another patty to your burger. One patty is MORE than enough, and unless you want to induce a heart attack on  your drive home, I would advise you to steer clear of this. My roommate ordered the Tahini Salad, which far exceeded her expectations. Who knew Pinky's could also make a mean falafel? The other roommate ordered a corndog and stated that it was \"the best corndog she's ever had.\"   The servers here are great; always making sure that your glass is filled up, and never hesitate to offer their recommendations on what to get. Prices are great, and portion sizes are huge.  Pinky's is definitely worth a visit at least once during your time in Charlotte, and I think you'll find you'll be happy you came...although I'm not sure your scale will be as appreciative."}
{"text":"After a scary run for your life through the dinosaur filled parking lot (rar), head into the semi-sturdy structure with a VW bug on the roof and find...food? Yes!  Success in the oddest place.  Now forget about the clunk of German ingenuity on the roof, put on a nascar hat, oil stained jeans, and fit into a little something called the \"white trash burger.\"  The bun is soft and not overbearing, the meat has good flavor, an overall great burger.  It would be nice if it was a little larger, but hey, we're just happy to be outta' the trailer.  The chips are nice and crispy, but quite bland; perhaps this explains the pissed off cretaceous period in the parking lot.   The fries are good as are the fried pickles.  A nice burger joint with a few Land of the Lost hipsters to boot.  Roll credits."}
{"text":"I love it here ! Good food good atmosphere! I highly recommend the unicorn tears drink or the squirrely temple."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for burgers and fries so my friend suggested we go to Pinky's (so he could get a vegan chili hotdog). Great suggestion especially since this is another spot that has been featured on one of my favorite food show Diners Drive Inn and Dives.  The place is a great dive bar with a really cool patio! There are all types of cool artifacts on the walls. Are bartender also was really great and made sure my friends and I got our orders in before the kitchen closed!  I got the 5 ounce PTERODACTYL burger with everything on it. All burgers are cooked medium well and my burger was juicy something I look for when eating a good burger. Unfortunately the burgers don't come with fries so I had to order them as a side. They give you a good amount of waffle fries which was a good thing because u shared them with my friend.  I had my burger prepared with everything on it just one of the various ways you can get. They also have other menu items including crab puppies (hush puppies with crab in them) and corn dog shrimp! Can't wait to go back and try both of them on my next visit. They have a great drink menu and even a section for those who don't drink alcohol. Make sure you check the pinks painted Volkswagen bug!"}
{"text":"What an amazing lunch! First of all it was Wednesday $3 well drinks...we had absolutely the best margaritas in town made by Geri an unbelievably nice and sweet bartender. Old school bartender not a drink server. We had the Kinda Fried Turkey Sandwich.  It was one of the best sandwiches we've ever had. Every person we spoke to was so friendly. I cannot wait to go back! What a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great white trash burger and pickle chips, bad service. We saw our waitress two times, once for our order the second for our bill. However, it wasn't her fault, she was too busy with too big of a section. Will definitely come again but next time maybe not a weekend night."}
{"text":"This is the best priced food you'll find in charlotte without contest. Comes in big portions and tastes great. The service is fast and it is a cool little atmosphere too. The only downside is it is pretty loud inside."}
{"text":"Great music, servers have awesome shirts. Really laid back type vibe"}
{"text":"We love pinkys!!!  We have become a regular for the kids eat free Monday!!  It is so close to our swim night that it just makes sense!!  Everyone there is friendly and the food is consistently good!  I LOVE the falafel salad with the garlic parsley dressing YUMMMM"}
{"text":"Had to visit a few times before I wrote my review, and I couldn't stay away from this place!  I work down the street (walking distance) and couldn't be happier to  have Pinky's in the neighborhood. It was much needed.  All the food I have tried so far was outstanding, burgers are great, huge hush puppies! Love the waffle fries! They have a large selection of \"more healthy\" eats for those who don't want a burger and waffle fries. Lots of great salads. The food here is very close to the Penguins, but dare I say it, I like the menu a lot better. Way more options, and I can't think of anything thats missing.   The service is always top notch, and casually friendly. Really nice bar, with a decent beer selection too!   Now that I wrote this, I think I know what i'm having for lunch! Thanks Pinky's!!"}
{"text":"I like Pinky's variety of food. They offer a lot of vegetarian options which is great for the days you want to go meatless, but they have standard burgers, etc. if you're looking for good American fair.   The only problem they have is consistency. Sometimes the food is on point and sometimes it's lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"Personality is all it takes sometimes. And this place has it in droves. Friendly staff complete the vibe while great quality and unique entires like the Buffalo Shrimp Salad make this place a lock.  And don't you dare order an entree without getting some sweet potato chips first!  I Pinky's 4 swims, and I'm only taking away half a star here because I wish there was a tinge more variety in the entrees. They have some better than great staples, but everything is a derivative off of those. I usually stop by here at least twice a month, and it'd be more if I could choose from a wider breadth of foodstuffs.  MOAR FOODSTUFFS!  Or maybe they should just stick to what they're great at. Either way, I love this place."}
{"text":"So many great vegetarian options! Corn dogs, veggie chili, black bean burgers... Love this place. Funky little dive bar."}
{"text":"Interesting place, in an unexpected location. I agree with the other reviews, so let me summarize...  Pros: Great atmosphere, good choice of drinks (drafts and cocktails), and some good food options (Greg's Fried Pickles, Pimp'n Fries, Corn Dog Shrimp).  Cons: Parking, some food options are a bit tired (White Trash Burger, Spaugh Buffalo Wings)."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is great!   My first visit was with a group of coworkers after doing an Escape Room adventure.  There were five of us at noon so the wait was long.  But it was well worth it.  I had the grilled pita which was arguably the best peta I've ever had.  Only minor complaint: I ordered fries and the waitress forgot but she later gave them to me to go and didn't charge. So Win Win!    My second visit was the next day because I forgot my credit card and had to go back to get it.  It was around noon again so very crowded but I got a seat at the bar and had the mammoth burger and fried squash.  The burger WAS mammoth and delicious.  Not greasy but very moist.  Excellent burger and I consider myself a burger aficionado so when I say it's excellent we're talking top 10 burger here.    But the best thing was the fried squash.    Each one was like a little piece of southern culinary heaven.  Golden fried and crisp with a slightly sweet salty taste.  And there were so many that try as I might (and believe me did) I could not finish them all.    If you have never been to Pinky's get yourself there.  I envy you your first taste of Pinky's deliciousness."}
{"text":"Probably closer to a 2.5, thought everything was way too greasy and I like greasy."}
{"text":"Before trying Pinky's I'd heard nothing but great things about this place. It is a fun environment with great inexpensive food!"}
{"text":"This place is a blast!  It's the kind of joint that makes you wonder why there aren't more like it.  They're not reinventing the wheel.  The menu is low priced and fun.  Very fun.  Check out the names and ingredients.  These are people who don't take themselves too seriously and it shows.  The bar is cool with quality people behind it.  I love that they have microbrew roulette which for $3 they blindly pick a random bottle of craft beer and that's what you get.  So simple but so much fun!  Parking sucks but most urban joints I've been to coast to coast have that problem.  The burgers are very, very good and I got what has to be the best $3.50 item I've ever bought in a dive.  It's a chili dog with pimento cheese spread under the chili.....Why didn't I think of that?!  If I get a little scratch and can open a place in my adopted hometown of Sanford, FL I will blatantly steal some of the great ideas this place exhibits.  If one can voice any complaint it's that nothing on this menu begins to approach healthy and after a bout with many beers, liquor and a mother load of calories one can feel like a tick.  So very stuffed and bloated that not even a nap can help.  Well my visits were on a three day vacation weekend so moderation wasn't on the menu.  Great little joint!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat and relax. The service was fast and friendly. I highly recommend Pinky's and will definitely eat there again"}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by saying I will be returning to Pinky's to try different food next time.  Not a ton of parking available but I was able to snag a spot around 5:30 in a Friday afternoon.  It wasn't crowded when I arrived but packed when I left an hour and a half later. I was quickly seated at a booth near the front.  It was $3 craft beer roulette.  So they \"randomly\" select a craft beer for you and bring it to the table for $3.  Sadly both of mine were IPAs which are not my favorite but it was a good way to try different beers.  I started with the pimento cheese fries, side order portion, which were delicious.  I added a little bit of ranch but they didn't really need it.  Tastes like homemade pimento cheese and came out melted in layers on the waffle fries. You can also add bacon or chili but I think they are amazing with just the cheese.  The waitress recommended trying the flounder sandwich special, so I did. It  was nothing special which is why I'm giving Pinky's 3 stars for today's visit.  The bun was hard and cold.  The flounder was coated in dill seasoning.  It just wasn't very good. You can see how un appetizing it looks in the photos.  I've heard good things about their Korean tacos and will probably give them a try next time.   The service was great though. Water was always full and the wait staff was very attentive. I will be back to try it out again!"}
{"text":"The white trash burger - Mmm!  Very cool atmosphere too.  I'm glad this place opened up in Wesley Heights."}
{"text":"This place serves a really good burger. It can be made to order. You can choose fried pickle chips, onion rings, lettuce, beef steak tomotoes, name it, it is included. I could not have enjoyed it more.    I ordered the waffle fries, they came to the table cold and dry. I had to send them back. They still were a not so great when I got a new order.  I should have tried the cheese fries. They looked really good. The onion rings were delicious. Greasy goodness.   The waitresses were very friendly and helpful with menu selections honestly. There are so many drink specials it was hard for me to choose. The parking situation is clumsy.  Very little parking by the grill. There is parking around the corner with ominous warnings to take all of your belongings and no guarantee of safety at all. Park at your own risk.   I had patio dining on a wonderful day. A breeze came along and knocked the umbrella on my head. I was stunned and a bit dazed. This was an easily preventable accident.   The base of the umbrella was not weighted. The umbrella had a flimsy zip cord keeping it attached to the railing. It was not safe. It was mere inches from my eyes l was lucky my head took most of the brunt and less of my face. I had some swelling on the right side of my face and headache that night. I was sorry to see managment was not extremely concerned by this error.  My bill was deducted by a few dollars. The price of my mediocre tasting waffle fries. In an accident of this nature it would have been better to not bill my party at all. A more litigious patron would have called their lawyer from the table. I would have loved to give more stars, however getting hit in the head  while eating dry waffle fries was a serious offense that was taken much too lightly by management."}
{"text":"Good food for a great price. We ordered the crab puppies, white trash burger with sweet potato chips and the Greek pita with grilled shrimp. We had a solid meal, no complaints and an unbeatable price. The same burger would have been double the price anywhere else."}
{"text":"Got the Jiving Turkey Burger Westside style and it was delicious! So many drinks to choose from it was difficult to decide and they all had a different twist. I'll be back next week, lol"}
{"text":"I had corn dog shrimp with a crab puppy appetizer. Everything was delicious. The hubmachine had 2 pinky dogs and they were also really good. Gotta love homemade pimento cheese. We also had banana pudding and it was out of this world. We will definitely be back as often as possible."}
{"text":"There are not enough yummy words for how great this place is...I had the crab puppies as a starter, they were delectable! For my entree I ordered the pterodactyl burger dressed traditional with a side of the Pimpin' fries....YUMMERS!"}
{"text":"We were meeting up with some friends at Pinky's Westside Grill before the Panthers first preseason game.  We expected it to be a bit busy, so we showed up 3 hrs before kickoff.  The short of it is that the food was really good, but we still missed kickoff, and both first series.    We were seated promptly, and drink orders were taken.  10 minutes later, our beers showed up.  Pinky's advertises 16 oz Miller Lite got $3.  I ordered this, and received a 12 oz.  When bringing this to the waitresses attention, she said thats not what I ordered, and walked away.  We ordered appetizers, fried pickles and crab hushpuppies.  These were very good, but when we got to the bottom of the pickles, there was a pool of fryer grease in the bottom of the tray, thus making the last few inedible.    For the main course, I ordered the white trash burger and this was awesome.  My wife ordered some type of chicken sandwich with peanut butter and siracha sauces, and a basket of fries for us to split.  The sandwich didn't come with the siracha as stated, and we didn't get our fries until we asked for them several more times.  One of our friends didn't get his food until everyone else was done eating their meal.  Overall everyone loved the food (5 Stars), but the service was absolutely horrible (Negative 5 Stars)!!!  Maybe we'll try it again in a few years, but we're in no hurry to go back here to be treated like crap.  There are places closer to home I can go for that..."}
{"text":"Yum.   Warning: Expect a wait; but the wait is well worth it!   My order: Fried pickles and the Kinda Fried Turkey sandwich (herb coated turkey breast on a big bun, topped with melted provolone, bacon, basil, tomato & garlic-parmesan spread). Highly recommend the kinda fried turkey sammy. Pinky's deep-fries a full turkey that is completely herb coated then slices the turkey for the sandwiches. The turkey was moist, falls apart in your mouth and is extremely flavorful (probably the best tasting turkey I've ever had). The garlic parmesan spread was a perfect compliment to the turkey. The sandwich was so delicious that when I go back, I will definitely want to order this sandwich again due to fear that I might be semi-disappointed with a different dish (which I'm sure is unlikely).   In regards to the fried pickles, they were also delightful - but I've noticed it's nearly impossible to screw up fried pickles.   Also, they have diet cheerwine on \"tap.\" Doesn't get much better than that.   My bf had the Big John (6 oz chicken breast, fried or grilled topped with swiss cheese, bacon, honey mustard, lettuce & tomato on a seeded bun) with the vegetarian chili. He really enjoyed his meal as well - unfortunately, I can't comment any further as I didn't taste test them myself.   Our server was attentive but not overbearing and the prices are affordable.   If you haven't eaten at Pinky's yet you must add it to your \"restaurant I want to eat at list\" - or go there right now!"}
{"text":"Such amazing vegan and vegetarian food. The staff is super awesome and the banana pudding is to die for. I almost always go with the stray dog veggie dog!! Such good vibes and great service."}
{"text":"Patty melt burger was great, beer was cold and the service was excellent.  Avoid the onion rings, they're a pathetic basket full of salad toppings, waffle fries are super good."}
{"text":"Love coming here with friends. Food is fast and good. My friend lives around the corner and we can walk. Good beer selection and good staff."}
{"text":"Amazing.  My husband took me there for lunch during the week.  Fast service and the staff was friendly.  The food was amazing and also had vegetarian option."}
{"text":"It's always a coin flip whenever I'm in Charlotte looking for a burger, and fried pickles between Pinky's and Diamond since the whole Penguin fiasco happened.   The things I like about Pinky's is that it is easy to get to. Simple exit off of I-77 onto Morehead St. and look for the Volkswagen bug on the roof.  It is conveniently located near Bank of America Stadium, and a short drive to Time Warner Cable Arena.  The crab puppies here are a must if you're not in the mood for fried pickles, or onion rings. The sauce works perfectly with the flavor of the puppies. It is a taste that'll have you coming back. The fried pickles are just as delicious as ever, crisp and the breading doesn't fall over everywhere. The burgers come in different sizes and combinations of toppings. (I prefer the mammoth with bacon, cheese, and mayo)  If you're not in the mood for burgers, the hot dogs are a hit too, so my wife says and she's hard to please! I haven't had many drinks, only one actually and it was a bloody mary and it was really garlicy. Not complaining, I love garlic. The wait staff in all the times I have been have been nice, and kept my drink full. Can't complain. Usual meal for myself is around $12-$15 tip included.  What keeps Pinky's from a 5 star is one thing. Parking, not enough parking. I don't like having to park across the street which is sometimes full as well during lunch rush. Besides that the place is a must visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I were on our way to see \"The Toxic Avenger\" at the new location of Actor's Theatre of Charlotte and we needed a quick bite and cocktail before the show. I did a search on Yelp and came across Pinky's Westside Grill. What a great find! We found a parking spot in the small front lot and although there were people waiting for a table, the hostess told us the bar was first come, first serve. We grabbed two stools and checked out the menu. I ordered a pterodactyl burger \"ding dong style\" (peanut butter, slaw and sriracha sauce, which I had on the side). My husband ordered the pterodactyl burger \"westside style\" which had chili and coleslaw. Both were delicious and the side of sweet potato fries with honey mustard sauce were tasty as well. The burgers are all cooked to medium-well, which is not how we usually order but they were not dry and had a lot of flavor. The drink special for Thursday was any flavored Absolute vodka drink for $5. My favorite was the unicorn tears and my husband's was the Swedish Mule. Our bartenders were friendly and helpful, and the guy who brought out our order was professional and pleasant. We loved the funky atmosphere and the low prices on the menu were great. So great that we ordered two slices of lemon cake to go. Pinky's is a fun, tasty \"dive\" that we will be bringing our teenage daughters to!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian corndogs, it's good to meet you, but I might stick with your less clothed relative, jumbo soy dog. No offense, but I like 'em with less covering, I'm not a player, I just crush a lot.   And I'm crushing on these crab hush puppies. Oh crab-y, you know you fine with those big chunks of crab fried all golden brown. mmMM, damn good with that (tartar) sauce.   Fried pickles, girl, you might want to sop up some of that oil, there are many pools I'd like to jump into, but your oil pool is not one of them. Clean yo self up and we can talk then.  Cheap beer, you are my weakness. I keep telling myself I won't succumb to my desires for you, but your price point and promise of a good time keep pulling me back.   Pinky's, I know I'm all gross and sweaty from ultimate when I come in, but you couldn't care less. You still treat me right each and every time. I always visit on off times, so haven't felt the wrath of your crowds, which is good for me, because I don't think I could handle my jealousy.   I'll be back soon boo."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the most fun places in the QC. Great service and food with an even more entertaining music selection. They have a decently diverse beer selection as well. Try the White Trash burger if you're feeling adventurous and hungry."}
{"text":"What a fun place to have lunch and drinks!! The menu offers many types of burgers as well as chicken sandwiches among many other choices. The menu had a large selection of choices likely to please most pallets. Serving sizes were generous to say the least. I'm not a huge burger fan, that said I had their smaller burger which to me was huge as well as fantastic. They offer several sides including regular fries as well as yummy sweet potato fries. Pinky's offer a full service bar as well as numerous drafts including from many local breweries. Parking is in a side lot a short distance past the resturant. There are several seating areas both at the actual bar as well as inside a small patio/outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Good bar food, pretty good drinks. Their hours don't match their ambiance. They should be open later"}
{"text":"Visited NC from Boston, ended up coming here 3-4 times. The atmosphere alone is just fantastic, not to mention the food!!"}
{"text":"good food, and odd but interesting environment. The Hush puppies and Crab puppies are phenomenal. they are made to order so they take some time but come out piping hot. as an entree the Big john chicken sandwich is great. finally for dessert get the delicious banana pudding."}
{"text":"We love Pinky's and their \"all hands on deck\" philosophy. Their food is good, they have a great beer selection and the service is fantastic. There is always a staff member stopping by your table to make sure everything is ok and they are always filling your water or asking if we need anything else."}
{"text":"I am subtracting two stars here based on an experience I had this week.  Was here for drinks on a Tuesday night, the place wasnt packed so my friend and I sat at the bar.  There were two bartenders but obviously their friends were at the bar and they had zero interest in serving anyone else.  It took 15 minutes to get the menu, the bartenders could not have been ruder!!!  When i asked for a beer they didnt have she threw the beer list at me and didnt come back for another 15 minutes.  It was probably some of the worst service I have seen in Charlotte!  Take some midol beotch!!!"}
{"text":"I know I am in the minority on this one, but I would be lying to myself if I didn't say that this has to be one of the worst restaurants I have been to in a very long time. It really is unfortunate because I was really looking forward to eating here.   It all started with the service. We put our name down and the hostess asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. We asked if the outside was shaded etc. she told us that they had a gorgeous patio with fans shade umbrellas etc. so we said outside would be fine. After 15 mins she took us to a patio with no fans, no shade and a bunch of smokers. We told her that would not work and she accommodated us elsewhere. (After another 15 minute wait.)   The food was beyond subpar. It was downright nasty. I ordered their chicken sandwich. (Supposed to be one of their most popular with peanut butter, slaw, siracha and so on.) When I got my sandwich the grilled chicken was chewy and tasted like what you would get at the school cafeteria. My bun was most likely made by wonder bread. My fries were undercooked and soggy.   To top off the bad food we didn't have good table side service. It was like they wanted to flip our table so fast we had a different waitress asking us every 30 seconds what we wanted to eat before we ordered. JUST GIVE ME A SECOND TO LOOK AT THE MENU!    To top that off I went home feeling sick and got mild food poisoning. I will not be back and will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had a work celebration at Pinky's this afternoon and offered to bring me home dinner because I've been wanting to try it since Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives a few weeks ago. (He's sweet like that.) I looked through the menu online and had a tough time narrowing it down because so many things looked good or fairly interesting and unique. I ended up requesting the Kinda Fried Turkey Sandwich because I remember it being featured on the DD&D episode. Something about the turkey breast being enclosed in some wrapping and then deep-fried in oil... like poached, but in grease at a high heat. Needless to say, I was intrigued.  I must say this sandwich did not disappoint! And I ate it after it had been brought home to sit in our fridge for several hours, keep in mind. It held up beautifully! Sturdy, tasty bun. The turkey really was wonderfully moist and flavorful. Slathered with some kind of garlic sauce with hearty basil leaves topped on. And provolone with a nice bite, toasted to perfection. I am so impressed with this sandwich that I seriously cannot wait to visit Pinky's in person and try something fresh outta the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Very good burgers. A great menu and a very hip staff. If you want an off the wall yet delicious burger, this place is for you."}
{"text":"super cool place. my burger was delicious, good beer, the fried pickles were ok (i'm critical of fried pickles. i demand the best and only the best), the staff and patrons were fun."}
{"text":"One of my fav things about pinky's is...they play good music! Good food for on the lower end prices compared to most burger places around Charlotte. Got a good funky vibe going on there; but it's welcoming and cool. And you can't beat their drink prices! That's my second fav thing about pinky's! ;)  I had a strawberry lemonade marg for ($6) but it was Sunday where they have 1/2price so $2.50 a glass.   Their sweet potato fries with honey mustard=my fav side.   Their burgers are good!"}
{"text":"We discovered this place, but I was afraid to try it. We finally tried it and the food is yummy! Service is pretty good! We eat here at least twice a month now!"}
{"text":"I am surprised it has taken this long for me to get into Pinky's, better late than never?   Went after work Monday around six, parked and as I opened my car door I heard the beautiful music of Megadeth coming from the restaurant BIG PLUS. Was with a group and we ordered a few appetizers: Fried pickles, sweet potato fried, onion strings and fried green tomatoes. Which were all great, my favorite being the fried green tomatoes they came with an awesome horseradish dipping sauce. Knowing that one of the guys from the original Penguin opened Pinky's I had to get a burger, so I went with the White Trash burger...the name grabbed me. At 4.50 it may have been the best burger for its price I have had, it had fried pickles, fried onion strings, provolone cheese and I believe there was some bacon in there too. The flavor punched me in the mouth and I loved it.   The food was flavorful and affordable. The restaurant is very hip and the music played here is GREAT. Which means a lot to me, being able to enjoy a meal to Public Image Limited opposed to Katy Perry is such a relief."}
{"text":"I'm going to jump on the bandwagon here! I recently experienced the Charlotte institution that is Pinky's and it did not dissapoint! The White Trash Burger is a home run and their waffle fries smothered in cheese and bacon are legit. Be prepared to take a nap after.   The service is good, you don't get an individual server but it you get good attention from everyone. It's all hands on deck."}
{"text":"I have always heard great things about Pinky's so my family and I went on a Friday evening. I will definitely return in the future.  +Vegetarian/Vegan friendly- Thanks Pinky's! I am a newbie vegan and I ordered a vegan burger with vegan mayo. Also they offer salads, appetizers and a falafel wrap. My burger was very good except they put too much mayo. + Customer service- Although it was extremely busy all the staff were very friendly and made sure to check on us, refill cups, and quickly remove finished dishes +Location- I am so glad Pinky's is on the Westside of Charlotte.   -Wait Time- we probably waited over 25 mins for a table for four. The waiting area is small. -Dining area- It is very tight in the dining area which also includes a bar. You get to know your neighbor."}
{"text":"Yummy! We went for lunch today, and have never been before. We didn't know what to expect, but the place is so cute inside. The employees were very friendly, and all the servers help wherever they saw a need so our glasses were never empty. My husband had the mammoth burger and potato salad. He said it was the best burger he's ever had in a restaurant. I tasted it, and agreed. In fact, I was jealous when he got his that I had not ordered it! I got the corn dog shrimp. Those were quite tasty as were the fries especially dipped in the spicy ranch sauce. A very pleasant experience, and one I'll look forward to repeating (except I'm getting on of those burgers!)"}
{"text":"Had the bestttttttt vegan chili cheese fries and the beyond meat burger everrrrrr!!! My fiancé is not vegan and was hesitant but when he tried it, he was impressed how much it tasted just like regular chili fries and burgers. Yummmmmy now I want more !!!"}
{"text":"Food and service are good. It's a little noisy for my taste and the parking situation could be greatly improved. Recommend going during off peak times."}
{"text":"Anyone who doesn't order the fried dill pickles is doing themselve a disservice.  A small order of Greg's {DEE-LICIOUS} Pickles is large enough to easily feed three people, and they are reasonably priced to boot.   The green chili pork sandwich with pineapple slices is fantastic. This is my go to sandwich at Pinky's, even over their White Trash Burger.    Service is outstanding, but one has to exercise patience since Pinky's is usually very busy during lunch and dinner.  The music is loud, and the vibe is eclectic.    Parking is extremely limited, but there is plenty of parking across the street and behind the building.   The decor is just plain funky , there's no other word for it.  Greg, the man himself, came around and asked me if everything was good. I had my mouth full, so I smiled and gave him a thumbs up - message received. LOL.   I love Pinky's and I've always had a great time here.   Forget the Penguin, Pinky's is the real deal."}
{"text":"I used to go a lot when I was a teacher nearby and got out of work early on Fridays. Most of the food is fried/unhealthy, and not actually good enough to warrant eating total crap, so I'm not a huge fan. The burgers are pretty good, but that's it. Definitely not worth the fuss or the wait that you always see."}
{"text":"The portions are big, so get ready to share!!  I had the fried pickles, the burger melt, and the crab balls. They were all amazing."}
{"text":"Love the vibe and food. Drinks are STRONG. Service is a hoot, sometimes slow but you are so happy to be there you don't really notice."}
{"text":"I stopped in to grab a quick bite.  I have eaten at the location downtown and they both were ok.   I had the chicken sandwich and again it was ok.   Not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots, I can't believe I have not yelped about Pinky's before today!  Met my baby girl and her boo for lunch. Arrived around 12:30 and did not have to wait, which was suprising,because the place is usually packed.  I dig the decor,and the inked up wait staff who are always friendly, attentive and quick with the refills.The fried pickles were spot on on today.  I had the white trash burger, which was as always delish!  The service is fast, the food hot, plentiful and consistent.  The drink menu is very imaginative, although I always go for lunch, so I haven't had the pleasure of trying anything on it.  I'll have go for dinner to give something a try.  Parking is usually a bit of a challenge, as the parking lot is very tiny (there's additional parking directly across the street and to the right of the building, but this inconvenience is worth it for the treat that you will get inside."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome. Burger was great hush puppies incredible and just love the I don't care atmosphere. Diner drive ins and dives was very smart to come here."}
{"text":"The food here is decent depending on the day. The service is awful is there is more than five tables. The servers can't figure out how to assist everyone waiting. Today I waded 10 min before I had to take my check to the bar and pay so I could get back to work on time."}
{"text":"Man, did I want to love this place. It has a cool atmosphere, friendly service, good beer selection, and a menu that had me wanting way more than I could eat. This is just a fun place to be.  As an appetizer, we had Jalapinkies, which were quite delicious and imaginative. Jalapeños stuffed with pimento cheese, dipped in corn dog batter and fried. They were huge, but I managed to eat more than one because they good. The crab hush puppies and fried pickles we ordered were popular too.  So this seems like a fairly glowing review so far, why did I only give it 3 stars? The burger. I'm a burger fanatic and I'm always looking for new and fun burger flavors. I'm not picky, I'm not a snob, but I do have some standards.  I ordered a Triple G burger Ding Dong style. That's a 3 patty burger with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce. It sounded amazing, but there's a snag, they only cook the burger patties to a particular doneness. OVERdone.   The dry burger patties overpowered the toppings on the burger that originally made it sound so appealing in the first place. I decided to remove a patty to see if I had less meat, would the other flavors come thru? Nope. Maybe one patty. Not much better.  I did have a bite of the bun and found the combination of runchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce to be a great idea. It's too bad the overcooked meat was the most dominant flavor. I was disappointed.  If this place fixes how it cooks it's burgers, it would definitely be a must stop whenever I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love love this place. It's fun and funky. I don't even like pimentos to cheese but I love the pimento frys! Had a white trash burger, I have to admit I was little worried but it was great. My husbands patty melt was great too. My Shirley Temple was excellent. I recommend this place to everyone. Go try you'll love it."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now, And yes, I'm a fan. Good food and great service."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way to the airport.  They had a large variety of beers. And some interesting memue items. Pinky dog was awesome"}
{"text":"Love this place! Its very busy and parking isn't great but man the food is good. I have been here many times. Will always return. I am NOT a fan of the Pinkys in Huntersville as it is a totally different experience and service was not great. Try the chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Thank you Pinky's for remembering your audience that don't eat land meat. I appreciate and love that I can come here and still enjoy an American all time favorite dish, chili cheese dog aka a \"Pinky's\" dog, in vegetarian form.   Whenever my husband and I are crazing hotdogs we love to grab a famous dog packed with so much flavor. The vegan chili dog with pimento cheese and chili is always hit."}
{"text":"This is easily our most favorite place to hit up.  Banging food, great atmosphere and a terrific staff.  We recommend it to all of our out of town friends!"}
{"text":"If the band GWAR opened a restaurant, it would be Pinky's!  This was my third time, including a rockin' event with Sierra Nevada and Sailor Jerry!  What goes better after a Brewery Tour than a nice cold Birdsong Higher Ground IPA? Unicorn Tears you say? Ding, ding!! Unicorn Tears are pretty much the best thing ever invented (forget about cars, toothbrushes and sliced bread)!! She cries rainbows I tell you!!  Love the team waitress concept! What man doesn't want attention from at least three pretty girls all at once!! And they bring me things I ask for!!  Rock'N'Roll diner food plus a cool a$$ bar! And Oderus Urungus definitely decorated this joint!  White Trash Burger is my fave, followed by the Mammoth! Sure the presentation might look underwhelming, but the flavor is \"on like Donkey Kong!\""}
{"text":"Landmark - yes, Pinky's is a Charlotte landmark in my book. You can't miss that VW Beetle on the roof!  It's definitely a unique place with a unique feel - definitely outside of the box from your typical burger joint. The White Trash burger is a staple for me and Unicorn Tears are my jam. On Thursdays $5 Unicorn Tears are my Discount Jam! Daily Drink Specials! Good selection of local beers!  Hot Dogs, Burgers, Vegetarian options - the Nature Boy (black bean burger) is pretty good. Solid appetizers too like fried pickles and Crab Puppies (kinda like hush puppies with crabmeat in the batter).  If you drive by and think it's too crowded, it may not be. The front lot is small! There's always room to park in Pinky's rear...hehe ... yeah, I said it...  Good place to bring out of towners for a little local flavor.  Pinky's makes me happy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The best Patty Melt around! Make sure to get the house made chips- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the white trash burger with everything on it and the Triple C Brewing' Golden boy blonde ale. The beer complemented the burgers comprehensive flavor. The service was great quick and easy. They also knew their beers. They have a huge selection of craft beers brewed locally. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"The staff was amazing !!!!!!! Get the white trash burger it was fantastic. Coming for Las Vegas I can say we have nothing like this !!!!!"}
{"text":"In Charlotte for work and found this restaurant on yelp. Hoping vibe in here. It is 1 o'clock in the afternoon I am here for lunch but several people are at the bar drinking"}
{"text":"Not the original location, haven't eaten there yet, but this delivered! The appetizer waffle fries with melted pimento cheese (homemade) on top is one of the best appetizers I've ever had, anywhere. The turkey burger was good too but I would honestly just go back for the waffle cheese fries."}
{"text":"One of my favorites! I've tried everything. My faves are the crab puppies, buffalo shrimp salad, short rib and fish tacos, and the banana pudding.  I love their signature cocktails as well... My favorite is the ginger margarita!  The staff is primo! Love you, Pinkies!"}
{"text":"Rating a 2 for the customer because that's all this place had going on. I didn't tip because we literally had like 5 different people checking on us, bringing food, taking our trash, refilling our drinks... so I didn't know who to tip! Very good waiters & waitresses!!! Now the food... the burgers with everything on them were pretty bland. I couldn't believe that DDD raved about this place. Definitely lacking something. The shrimp appetizers was pretty good & the sweet tea wasn't weak.  I don't think I really have a reason to go back..."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I intend to visit again and amend my review thusly.  I dropped into Pinky's for the first time today around 3:45pm with my wife. I ordered the Southern 500 and she ordered The Stray Dog with the slaw on the side and cheddar cheese added. We also got an order of waffle fries and onion rings.  Ok. They were SLAMMED. It was truly unbelievable. Totally understandable to expect slower service, but even still we were waiting for food until 4:36pm. To me, it seemed there was a shift change which perhaps contributed to the delay. The kitchen guys were busting their humps and the hard-working wait staff seemed unable to keep up completely. Not their fault, really, it just seems like they could have used several more hands.  The food: My wife's soy dog was the most revolting \"hotdog\" either of us have ever tasted. I mean honestly. Barfaroni. Her slaw was forgotten and the cheddar they added was laughable. Not enough to justify asking.  The waffle fries and onion rings are awesome. Waffle fries could come in a larger portion for cost, but the same cannot be said of the onion rings. Plenty of them and deliciously fried.  My dog was awesome. Truly delicious from start to finish. The slaw is reminiscent of tartar sauce, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but definitely not what I expected.  The place has an amazing ambience. Powered by a jukebox, we were treated to lots of Slayer, Jay-Z and The Cure to name a few. Oh, and Kiss pinball. It's pretty loud inside which doesn't bother me, but you will want to speak loud and clear to be sure your unsweet tea doesn't get mixed up with sweet as mine did.  Again, I'll be back. Lots of menu items to check out. With a congenial staff and great atmosphere, it's most definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Each year I take my mother anywhere she wants to go eat for her birthday.  She's from a small town and loves to try new places in Charlotte. This year she chose Pinky's and was very excited. We chose to sit outside and I immediately loved the atmosphere. 80's music and the menu offered a great variety including several vegetarian options for my daughter to choose from. The crab puppies and fried pickles were really good. We will be back."}
{"text":"I get to do the 500th review of Pinky's?!  Not sure if there is much to add that the other 499 reviews haven't covered.   The fried pickles are amazing. The burgers are decent considering they're cooked well done.  You're not stopping here on your health food pilgrimage, but for some classic american greasy spoon cooking you can't do much better in Charlotte."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Charlotte and their fries are delicious. Cool laid back atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Sooooo normally this place is phenomal. However had to go glutten free and per the website they say it's accomidating we came. Got the gluten free mammoth burger in a lettuce wrap. Wrap being the noticeable word. When it came out it was a burger on a piece (burger sized ) of lettuce. Not wrapped not where I could eat it with my hands. I did manage to get a fork and a knife however because I was stuck eating a burger without the bun it started eating through the little paper thing in the boat. Had to flag down another waiter (ours actually hasn't returned for a while) who when asked if everything was okay said she'd go get the manager.  Eventually the manager did come out although I didn't ever get her name and took care of the \"lettuce wrap\" prepare yourself if you order that."}
{"text":"Had my first visit here just the other week and it was finally a dream come true.  I had heard such good things I just couldn't wait to give this place a shot.  I came away feeling that this place deserved the hype it's given.  I love the menu, cute play on names that describe each dish and the outdoor seating is nice b/c of how you can feel the outside elements yet be protected from the weather at the same time given the fact it's actually still inside.  I had the Tony Bologna (Boloney) and loved it.  It's rare to be able to get a true redneck style dish around here anymore but alas this place has it!    My only suggestion would be better drink specials, everything else seemed quite perfect in my opinion."}
{"text":"Me and my husband wanted to try a new place so I yelped Pinkys.  So glad I did. I went to pickup my order and the customer service was amazing. They made sure I was taken care of. I ordered the buffalo shrimp tacos and they were awesome. I also got the Shirley Temple in which they have pineapple in the drink...I highly recommend. Parking is hard but once you get inside it's a nice place to drink and get a great bite to eat."}
{"text":"Pinky's Westside Grill was great. I had the White Trash Burger and my husband had a patty melt with a turkey burger. It was great! Service was great! I've never had a burger with fried pickles and fried onion rings. It was oh so beautifully fatty and good. Yummmm now I want to go back! :)"}
{"text":"I heard really great things about Pinky's and decided to try it out with three of my friends. I was not disappointed! The service was great! Our waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered a pitcher of the house margaritas ( which were not watered down so that's a plus ), crab hushpuppies - absolutely delicious, and the corn dog shrimp - I was skeptical about trying but Pinky's surely delivered and I enjoyed every bite. Our food came out in a timely manner and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"My personal favorite burger place in Charlotte. My order always seems to be the same when I go or I order take out. Always go for the white trash burger, add sour kraut and it's perfectly delicious! The chili cheese waffle fries, fried pickles, crab puppies and veggie burgers are a must try too! My fav time to visit is on Friday's for craft beer roulette. Bring a few friends so you guys can swap out beers if you get one you don't like ;)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a quick lunch date. He has never been here before and he was not disappointed! We had a great time here, the service was amazing all the waiters were excellent! Everyone was very personable, they made us feel welcome, they even helped me out with which taco I should order. I already tried the shrimp and fish tacos, so I decided on the Kick'n Chicken Tacos with the help of the waiter; who raved about how delicious they were! And honestly, I was very pleased they were awesome!   My boyfriend enjoyed everything as well, he ordered the Skrimpz as an appetizer and boy am I glad he did!! I think I ate more of them then he did :/ I am not a fan of tarter sauce but just by looking at it I knew it wasn't your average tarter sauce , so I had to give it a try! OMG the best tarter sauce on the planet! Pinky's will never disappoint! This is a fun place, with great food and very inexpensive! I will be back before the week is over:) And I will try something new, heck the whole menu is worth a try I must say!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites!!! You can not go wrong with anything here everything is delicious and they have fun names to match the food! The staff is always super cool! The staff has tattoos and piercing which just gives to the ambiance of the restaurant; cool and laid back!  Everyone here is very accommodating, with great customer service!   You could literally order the whole menu because everything is so cheap! But trust me you will get lots of food so don't do it! I love their tacos, burgers and the appetizers. You can pick anything and will not get disappointed!!   This place is a cool place to go to at night as well. It's pretty busy on the weekends so get there early so you can get a good seat at the bar or so you won't have to wait long for a table!"}
{"text":"Pinkys rocks. Always solid food. Always fast. Sometimes the wait is long but it's worth it! The pimpin fries are a must try. The menu is great from salads to loaded over the top burgers. They've got a few vegetarian items that are tasty as well."}
{"text":"I truly love Pinkys! Everytime I go, wheat her it's with friends, solo or for take out the service is great, food is amazing and the atmosphere is trendy. I truly love Pinky's"}
{"text":"Great wings! Staff is very attentive && friendly. Fairly priced drinks. Kids eat free on Mondays."}
{"text":"So I dropped in here for lunch this week with the wife to see what all the fuss was about.  Having followed all the drama in the paper about what this place to become and how it almost became the \"new\" Penguin, I figured it was time for a taste test of my own.  First of all, the parking is an afterthought that should have been a first thought as the location is not \"neighborhood friendly.\"  The corner of Freedom and Morehead is not exactly the place you want to be darting across the street.  With only 6 real parking spots in front of Pinky's, the logistics of parking is something to keep in mind.  I found parking in a grassy lot off Morehead, just past the restaurant.  This space seemed like a go to for others as well.  I have no idea if this is 'legal' parking space, but my car was still there when I got back and there were no nasty-grams on the windshield, so...  Moving on to the actual space, I quite liked the interior decor.  It was a mix between a bar, a man-cave and a tiki hut, all stuffed into a garage-type space with a juke box thrown in for good measure.  Where you sit will actually determine which theme you get.  My favorite were the two-seater booths adjacent to the bar, small and compact, but just enough space for a cozy lunch with non-stranger.  I was glad to see a hostess station at the front door, something needed at more of the popular dives in town.  We were seated right away, being only a party of two.  I'd be leary of going here with a much larger party, not only did they have to wait, but pushing tables together here would be a little like one of those puzzle mazes- move the pieces around until the picture is formed.  Service is attentive but very casual, most of the servers wear their body and facial piercings proudly along with their black t-shrts with Pinky's logo.  Just part of the local color as far as I am concerned.  I am very glad to see servers use the team approach- as in the person who took your drink order may not take your food order and also may not be the person who brings the food to the table.  This always makes me feel very \"taken care of\" and ensures drinks are refilled and food is served as soon as it comes from the kitchen.  The menu is broken down into sections- apps, salads, burgers, dogs, and other sandwiches.  There is no consistent theme to the menu- from fresh falafel to a thai-style melange of toppings for your burger or dog.  This is not to say it's bad, just know that the options are plentiful and different.    I had the Falafel wrap and it was a little wimpy for me.  Falafel patties were a bit too mushy and the wrap was too big for the contents of the sandwich.  Slathering in too much tahini sauce did not help fill the void either- it just overpowered the other tastes.  I did not finish mine.    Now my wife had a burger and it was quite good.  Cooked nicely and the bun was a perfect mix of soft and chewy without being a total mess.  Did not try the Ding-Dong style , so I have no comments for this.  Something about peanut butter on a beef burger just didn't do it for me.    Sandwiches do not come with a side- you need to order separately.  Waffle fries were nice and crispy.  Note that a single order is enough for two to share- and they should be at a price of about $4.  Another tempting option was sweet potato fries- they will have to wait for another trip.  Do not skip appetizers, though.  Seriously good friend pickles with a proper ranch sauce should be a must for most.  Thin-sliced pickle chips in a crispy friend batter, they way the should be.  No pickle spears, no wimpy breading.  This is a highlight for Pinky's.  I might just agree with others: these are an improvement over The Penguin's version (sacrilege, I know).    The bar has quite the selection of beers, including PBR tall boys.  Many micro draft selections abound too.  Had it not been a business day lunch, I'd have definitely had a beer with the pickles.  However, I do give Pinky's props for serving the huge glasses of tea or soda.  No frequent refills needed.  So yeah, there are some issues here.  But I also found quite a bit to like.  Now as you might can piece together from our meal selections, this is not a place to be calorie-conscious- though you might could make it work with their salad selections (but then you'd miss all the really good stuff).  But sometimes you just have to follow the flavor, and Pinky's definitely has the start of something good there."}
{"text":"Food and service was awesome. I ordered the popcorn chicken salad with ranch dressing. Yummy! I pulled some of the fried onions off to the side to eat as an appetizer. Service was good! Will definitely return! Sorry no pic was so hungry I ate it all up"}
{"text":"As I've shifted to avoiding terrestrial vertebrate meat unless I know its provenance, I wanted to update my recommendations:  I now am loving the veggie burger \"ding dong\" style, which means with shredded cabbage, chunky peanut butter, and sriracha sauce.  The burger itself is bean based, but gets a great crunchy outside that goes well with the smooth interior.  I will still usually pair it with the tuna melt for that amazing ginger kick."}
{"text":"I love food with good flavor and I can promise you Pinky's does not disappoint. It's worth the effort in trip to visit this place. Customer service is amazing and the food is top-notch. This is a must-visit restaurant."}
{"text":"We love this eclectic restaurant. Great sweet potato chips, great off beat tacos and more. The wait staff are always friendly and quick. Food is great, typically comes in baskets like old fashion drive-ins.   It's a very creative menu with lots of vegetarian options. The buffalo shrimp tacos and salad are both favorites of ours."}
{"text":"This story ends with me on my couch at 1 am, swearing I was only going to eat one of my leftover crab puppies and, of course, eating them all. And they're just as good cold as they are hot- maybe better. That is one delicious ball of yum.   Let's back up and say that I've been here before, but it's been awhile. I can't get the White Trash Burger out of my head though. That, plus the beer list and the atmosphere and you've got a winner. I still haven't tried the corn dogs but they're on my to-do list.  I know others have mentioned the parking, but it really is a big sore spot to this otherwise excellent restaurant. I had to turn around twice to be able to even get into the lot across the street (with the tattoo parlor) and then almost hit a Pinky's-bound pedestrian while I was turning in. I hate to be all Complainy Complainerson, but it really is a pain in the ass to get to."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Pinky's?? Everything is amazing and the decor is super artsy, super funky, it honestly just makes my heart happy! I haven't had a bad meal and I don't think I could pick out my favorite, so I'll tell you a couple of yummy things you should try. Appetizers: The homemade veggie chili is really good (I could use a bowl right now, it's so cold outside). Pimp'N fries, no you read that right, fresh waffle fries topped with melted pimento cheesey goodness. Greg's pickles, deep fried pickles with ranch. The portions are huge. AND my favorite, the crab puppies, they look just like a hush puppy but have crab inside, they're served with tarter sauce. I'm not a huge fan of tarter sauce but I'm a fan of this awesome combination! Burgers: my husband loves the white trash burger (burger with provolone,fried pickles, and onion rings and spicy ranch sauce) If I order a burger, I usually just get the Pterodactyl with cheese and pick my own toppings! I've tried the ding dong chicken sandwich once, the crunchy peanut butter, sriracha hot sauce and honey cilantro sounds like a weird combo and it was but it was also a weird/delicious combination. When I want to feel healthy, I get the Falafel with hummus or the grilled Pita. Even the Uptown Tuna Melt is really good. They literally have anything for everyone! As for drinks, they have a great selection of beer and my two favorite cocktails are the Unicorn tears and the Poinsetta which is like a mimosa except with cranberry juice! Okay, I've literally written a book but this restaurant has been my go-to since moving to Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burger & tasty waffle fries. The spicy ranch dipping sauce paired well with the fries. The service was astonishingly quick! Loved it! The servers were all polite & always smiling. The burger \"ding-dong\" style was amazing. A flavor blast of peanut butter & siracha is weirdly delicious. Banana bread dessert was huge (in a good way). Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best burgers in Charlotte (Mammoth / Everything).  Shoestring Onion Rings were also amazing.  Definitely a great place to try."}
{"text":"Gotta hand it to someone who takes a old service station and turn it into a burger gold mine! These are the things you've gotta love about cities like Charlotte! Hardly any parking, but if you determine to get inside somehow, you're gonna love it! We started with the waffle fries that comes with pimento cheese and added bacon to that for a scrumptious result! The fries were crispy, the pimento cheese was excellent, and the bacon was real! Next, I got the White Trash Burger that was simply amazing! A nicely cooked burger with cheese, fried pickles, fried onion strings, and a spicy ranch mayo! Seems as though they have a very creative drink menu with specials every day! What kept me from giving them a five star rating was simply, the service! The servers all seemed disinterested. We struggled to get refills, waited nearly 10 minutes for a glass of wine, and the ticket was just kinda tossed on the table! This southern gentleman will certainly be back, at least for the food."}
{"text":"The food at pinkies is limited for those of us allergic to gluten. They offered fries in clean oil but I cannot bring myself to believe that the cleaned fryer is really not contaminated. On the other hand the burgers and the not quite fried turkey sandwiches are excellent if a little large.  The limeade/ginger drink is a tall cup of wellness that can heal what ails you. Not sure why I feel better when I have it but I do. The place is noisy but the food is worth it. I'd give more stars if there were more gluten free options especially dessert."}
{"text":"I've been on a Pinky's kick lately, and it's become one of my favorite spots.   Everything I've ordered here has been exceptional. The food is killer, and the prices are more than reasonable. Check out my previous review for specific recommendations.   I love that Pinky's has kind of a grungy vibe, sometimes coupled with death metal churning away on the patio, and a bevy of tattooed and tough-looking waitstaff, yet I still receive excellent service and share the restaurant with every kind of person that calls Charlotte home. And it's a fantastic spot to bring out-of-towners!  Pinky's is more than legit. They've got a loyal fan in me."}
{"text":"Delicious menu, well trained allergy-friendly staff & good service are why I'm in love with Pinky's.  I went to Pinky's pretty early on, and have been a fan all along. Everything I had there was tasty from my burgers to the crazy good hummus appetizer that was more of a meal.  Then, in September '10, I was diagnosed with crazy allergies.   Which meant giving up restaurants for a while. Then, in December, after moving into the neighborhood I tried Pinky's again in the hope they could accommodate me.   Andy, one of the owners, came and talked to me about the menu and helped me pick out a meal I could safely eat, which essentially meant custom creating a salad and salad dressing for me. They were happy to do it, took extra precautions in the kitchen, have remained helpful and cautious about my meals since. Finding a restaurant, especially of the diner variety, willing to accommodate like this is always a treat - especially when it's just down the street.  If you have allergies, be prepared (as always when eating out) to have a chat with the owner/manager on duty, the servers sometimes say \"I'm not sure we can do this.\" They can - just be patient and ask. It's worth it for tasty yums!   I take all my out of town friends and family here, in part so I don't have to cook dinner one night, and partly to get everyone to try fried pickles (how I miss thee!) and to get the brave to try a sandwich Ding-Dong style.   Service can be tight, so I recommend going on off hours, especially if you have allergies - your food is more likely to get special, focused attention then. The place is *packed* Thurs/Friday/Saturday lunch and dinners, so I never go then, but love it on Tuesdays when I don't feel like cooking. Parking is limited out front, so if you don't have a handicap tag, be prepared to park across the street."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while now. And honestly, after today, NEVER AGAIN!!! The food is what's to be expected and I've ALWAYS had great service and customer relations with the staff. However, today, right as shift change happened, this bobbed headed young lady with fake blond hear was the new bartender and when I made a statement as to how good the Brussel sprouts that I had there a week earlier were and how I thought they would be a great addition to the menu. Her response was so SHITTY that I'll never go back! She can SUCK IT!!!!  Learn the word HOSPITALITY!!!! This isn't EAT AT ED'S!!! Sorry U!!!"}
{"text":"As far a dive bar & grills go, Pinky's was pretty good.  I would go back.  The burger was a little dry but had a good flavor.  The corndog shrimp have an excellent flavor.  I think next time I would prefer in on a corn dog but it surprisingly works on the shrimp too.  Fried pickles were good.  The house chips were a bit over cooked for my taste.  I appreciate that when you ask for a side of ranch, you get a SIDE of ranch, not a tiny 1/2 oz mini shot.  The Margaritas were good and the $15 special pitcher was well worth the price.  Overall, a good time.  Parking was minimal, but a dirt lot (caution very muddy) was only a couple block away."}
{"text":"If you want a great burger, this is the place.  Plan on waiting for seating and once you are seated, don't plan to be comfortable as it is mediocre. Parking is across the street or down the street but sadly you have the lazy fools who would rather hold up traffic in the rare chance they get to park in front of the place. I think there are 5 spaces + 2 Handicap spots in front.   The staff is attentive and rarely cause you to wait for a refill or to place your order."}
{"text":"Came here with my lady and we really enjoyed this place. I had the double cheeseburger and she had the nature veggie burger. Both were great! The buns are a little on the bigger size, but good. Then we saw a server take a bowl of what looked to be banana pudding! Had to order one of those.... Glad we did. It was a huge bowl that was more than enough for the two of us to share and it was excellent! We will be back for sure! Beers, burgers and banana pudding came to $33.00 I found the price to be inexpensive.  Oh, and the atmosphere and music is awesome! The Smiths were on when we walked in, and while we were there, we heard Devo, Blondie and the Ramones among others... so, cool music!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Loved everything. Best burger that I have ever eaten. Keep up the great work. Nice place to escape when your escaping from a hurricane."}
{"text":"First time.  Not sure if place is new but when I lived here a couple of years ago, didn't blip on my radar at all.  Really cool place and atmosphere.  Lots of things to look at, decor wise.  My waitress is nice and says thank you.  The fact she's attractive has nothing to do with my comment.  She mentioned a peach cider and I got it.  It is delicious!  I'll update when my food gets here. Excellent veggie burger!  I'd come back and her name is Kelsie"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this restaurant but I will will never eat there again and I will encourage everyone I know to avoid this place. The service is terrible and the management is completely rude."}
{"text":"Where else can you get fried pickles and a white trash burger. Tattooed waitress and black sabbath  In my ear  What else could you want Upscale - burgers hotdogs etc Fish tacos looked good Cold cold beer"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Clean, food is out of this world and  waiting times are slim to none. The staff very friendly , which makes that experience even better. I love it!!!  Prices are very affordable!!"}
{"text":"The thing I love most about Pinky's is that the menu is much different than you'd expect. It's not just burgers and fries like most places - they have unique menu items from gyro's to crab puppies to tacos. And it's not just throwing a bunch of stuff together, either - each item is carefully made to perfection. The joint is kind of divey and fun, and each of the waiters and waitresses help each other, which I find very sweet and awesome. They just remodeled the patio area and it's got a stellar view of Uptown. This place also has awesome drink specials and an entire cocktail menu under $5. It's seriously got it all! It's even a Pokémon gym, lol! I recommend the shrimp tacos, as they're my favorite, but I assure you that anything you try will be amazing. This is a Charlotte landmark and somewhere I always take people that are visiting from out of town. Don't just take my word, it's also Guy Fieri's favorite Charlotte dive!"}
{"text":"The menu is a perfect sized menu. Have a couple things and do those couple things right. They clicked on all cylinders. They need to update the size of the TV's but the staff was great, the food was great and you cant beat a KISS pinball machine."}
{"text":"Cool little burger joint. Great onion rings and some wacky sandwiches. Better than most other burgers in the area."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here. Customer service was great, just freaking awesome!! Everyone was nice and answered all of my questions.  I had a burger and it was soooo good!! The waffle fries are great too! I ordered a cherry limeade to wash it all down with. It was awesome! I'll definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a late night dinner our food was fresh and good. He chowed down on the Big John sandwich and house made chips which he thoroughly enjoyed and I had a special order of black bean tacos , topped with Arugula and Pico de gallo, along with a side of onion rings which were light and crispy. Chased with some of the best sweet tea I've had. It was surprisingly delicious. The meal and atmosphere were pleasant although you can easily overlook it as it does not have strong curb appeal,  we ate outdoors on the patio, a nice option. The prices are very reasonable and there are a surprising number of options.   The primary reason I am writing the review is because of the outstanding service we received from our server Lacey aka Livvy ( there are 2 Lacey's) . She was friendly and did an amazing job taking answering all of my many questions and taking my special order, our refills flowed , and any requests were met in a timely manner. Lacy/ Livy checked on us to ensure we were satisfied as well as other staff members.   It was appreciated . I felt valued as a customer , the service was on pointe. I would recommend and return."}
{"text":"I am a little biased given that Pinky's is walkable from my house, but this is one of my favorite go-tos for cocktails and a bite to eat. There is something for everyone from a good old fashion burger to the more unique ding dong chicken (grilled chicken with PB, slaw, and sriracha -- trust me, it works); all types of salads, sandwiches, and apps in between.   I've tried almost everything on the menu but my standard meal here always starts with crab puppies -- hush puppies with crab meat. Good drink specials and a fun cocktail menu top it all off. Oh, and friendly service to boot!  Parking isn't so great. There is hardly any in the front but they have a full dirt lot in back. No big deal, other than it's a few extra steps but that never hurt anyone. I would also give a word of caution to parents taking their kids here: they play all kinds of music, some with non-kid-friendly language. I personally don't give a BLEEEEEP because that's part of what makes the place so charming for me. But I know others might be turned off by it.   Otherwise, definitely check the place out, I think almost anyone can enjoy it!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Pinkys from different locals and seeing it on triple d, we were in the mood for some thick juicy burgers and we're headed to another spot but we finally decided to give Pinkys a try.  We were not disappointed at all, there's very limited parking in the front so we had to park in the overflow lot just up the street. It was really loud and crowded but in a good way. The one major thing I liked is how cool the hostess, the waiters and waitresses are. It's funny because one server gave us the menu, another server took our order and a completely different server bought our food, whilst a different server refilled our drinks. The same with the cleanup, To me that just showed teamwork.. Now the food, ordered the Crabmeat hushpuppies since they came highly recommended, those are by far the absolute best hushppies I've eaten. Sweet, crunchy and golden with hints of crabmeat throughout each one. I really only wanted a simple burger with globs of onion (yeah I know), so that's what I opted for, with provolone cheese. Needless to say the burger was darn near perfect. They do have several different burger choices though. My son had the patty melt he says it was extremely good and for him to say that, it had to be good.  Overall I'd give this place a 10 and would recommend coming with your girls or a cute and wild lil date night for something different. This is not the spot if you're trying to be romantic and go home and listen to some Luther Vandross or Marvin Gay....sorry Again, I'd give it a 10 and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Those pimento cheese fries just got upped... BY PIMENTO CHEESE FRIES WITH VEGETARIAN CHILI! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhmazing. Seriously. These things are the nectar of the Gods.  Tried the pork sandwich last night and my mouth threw a party - delicious sliced pork, pineapple, spring mixed greens and some delicious, light sour-cream based sauce lightly on the bun. So pleased with this choice, I debated buying another one to-go for lunch!  Only gripe: no Olde Mecklenburg on tap!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere and food. I like to take the kids here because it's fairly loud and I don't have to worry as much about the disturbing other customers. Great service, fast and nice little patio outside."}
{"text":"when craving a burger, you can never go wrong with the white trash burger. thanks, guy fieri, i appreciate you for this sweet find"}
{"text":"Burger and in-house made chips were decent, but not as awesome as I had hoped. The music and overall atmosphere is pretty loud. The service was excellent, though. Friendly servers and on top of everything. The food just feels a bit less than 'hot off the grill.'"}
{"text":"Just like the other location my found was on time and TASTY! I love the popcorn chicken salad! Great prices, timely take out and the food is consistently good!"}
{"text":"Awesome and affordable food with phenomenal service! Definitely recommending Pinky's to all my friends and family! If you haven't been, GO! You won't regret it! It's a little loud but the service here is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"MAN OH MAN!!  So irritated with this place and probably will NEVER go back. First off we get there and are party was four and three of us were there..  the place was dead and not exactly busy  and not like it was a friday night. this was a Weds. The crappy deshevled hostess told us she couldnt sit us until our fourth person got here i was PISSED.  Secondly, get soem REAL PLATES AND SILVERWARE!!  They served a salad on a Styrofoam  plate with plastic silverware REALLY???  It was pathetic and ridiculous.  I ordered the Popcorn chicken which honestly was decent but my chicken was brunt and overcooked..  it came iwth Waffle fries which honestly you could get at  Chik Fil A.  Also they asked what kind of dipping sauces we wanted for our chicken I stated ranch and BBQ we only get one any other sauce its a 75 cents charge!!  If your so desperate to charge for every little thing then why open a restraunt??  The service was bad the food was ok and to be honest"}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here. She said she LOVED the food. Well, I wasn't impressed with my lunch but being that it was only my first time I'm going to try them again another time. I can't remember what I ordered because it's been a few weeks but it was some type of vegetarian salad.  I didn't like it, it didn't have any flavor. Next time I'm going to order something different. The employees were awesome however. Very friendly. Very attentive, so I'm going to give them another chance."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Food is always amazing! They have the BEST grilled chicken sandwich in Charlotte. My boyfriend has tried all of their tacos and says they are all great. Philly cheese steak is also a good option. Their fries and homemade chips are delicious. Honestly there is not one bad thing I can I say about this place. Food, atmosphere, and staff are excellent."}
{"text":"We just saw this placed featured in Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and was in Charlotte for the day. The food was reasonably priced and the burgers were great. We had the corn dog shrimp which were featured on the show. Lots of breading, but good size shrimp in it too. The Asian pork burger, which was featured on the show was no longer on the menu. So I was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"At Pinky's Westside I had what some might call it \"winner winner burger dinner.\"  I got the White Trash burger, which was spruced up with ranch dressing, fried pickles (of Penguin drive-in legend), and onion rings. A side of crispy waffle fries and a Shirley Temple for the first time. Oh my goodness! I can eat that every.single.day.  Daily Specials: EVERYDAY: $5 Mimosa and Bloody Mary AND $15 Margarita Pitchers. Mon:  $1.5 Draft beers Tue: 1/2 price Tallboys & local bottles and cans. Wed: $3 well drinks & margarita + $6 long island iced tea + $1.5 beers. Thur: $2.50 All drafts + $5 unicorn tears. Fri: $3 craft beer roulette. Sat: $5 absolute anarchy (all absolute flavors). Sun: 1/2 price glasses of wine.  A meal at Pinky's Westside is definitely unforgettable! Four and Three Quarters Yelps."}
{"text":"Let me just say as a good ole Southern boy from South Carolina...this place absolutely knocked it out of the park!  I was a bit skeptical at first as it took a few minutes to even be greeted on a busy Sunday night but once in our seats the service was excellent and food was even better. Started out with the pimp'n fries which are waffle fries topped with pimento cheese. They were spectacular.  For the entree I got the pinky dog which was a hot dog topped with their house made chili and pimento cheese. It was incredible. I'm not sure what was in the chili but I wish I had the recipe. 100 percent this place deserves 5 stars. My girlfriend got the white trash burger and loved it as well.  Again if you're looking for a down home spot with great food and good vibes this is your place!"}
{"text":"i went to pinkys bcuz i spent 14 hours traveling and just made it back to Charlotte. it was 5 minutes away from home and seemed like it had good ratings. i DID NOT LIKE PINKYS. i got fried pickles- average, cheese fries- average. My sister loved her pineapple pork sandwich thing. and the crab hush puppies. they smelled fishy but i didnt taste any seafood in them. i will say the beverage was good. but unfortunately for them it was a fountain drink so i dont think they can take credit. lol"}
{"text":"Outstanding burger joint with an eclectic vibe. I loved everything about it!   The drinks are made STRONG (which isn't a complaint) try the Katrina hurricane... It will knock your socks off!! (I guess I should have taken the 2 limit as a warning)   I had the white trash burger and the pimento cheese waffle fries with chili and bacon... I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Pinky's is GREAT! I come here for lunch about once a week and I haven't had anything up until this point that I wouldn't order a second time.   This place is super unique - décor is funky and fun - the outside patio is perfect for a tasty meal on an nice day.  The service is fantastic.They wait on you as a group so you always have someone the to constantly check in. You'll never have to ask for a refill - the fill you up before you can even realize what's going on.  The \"Westside\" burger is delicious - mustard, chili, slaw & onion!? \"I put that sh** on everything\"  The Grilled Greek Pita w/ chicken is my go to sandwich. I almost wish there was more chicken put into it, with it being so good.  Nonetheless, the food is very good, the atmosphere is fun and it is always completely packed during lunch hours (always a good sign).  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Order the crab puppies! They were Delightful. The atmosphere is nice, staff friendly, and an overall great place to eat."}
{"text":"We love on the other side of town, so we don't get the chance to get over to Pinky's much, but we love it!  Such a cool and funky dive bar kinda place, with great quirky comfort food dishes.  I love the Pimpin Fries (pimento cheese over waffle fries + chili/bacon) that they recently added to their menu, it's the perfect greasy yet delicious way to start your meal ;)  My husband is obsessed with the peanut butter/sriricha/cole slaw burger, and I love the Tony Bologna and the Green Chili pork sandwich.... You really can't go wrong with anything. Everything that we have ever ordered here is solid."}
{"text":"This is your local bar. Come bring your dog and kids and get one of Pinky's great white trash burgers and fries. Service was great and so friendly. This is my local bar even without food"}
{"text":"Awesome food. The place is filled with funky decor and a juke box that has great music. Friendly and great service."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I was hesitant to go to the location because it isnt in the best part of town but the area is improving as new restraurants open.  Pinky's is a greasy burger joint with decent prices. The hummus is good and the fried pickles are excellent."}
{"text":"Pinky's is such a wonderfully funky place, inside and out. Follow the Beetle Beacon to this former auto repair shop and you'll rub elbows with bikers and businessmen who unite under the same banner--that of deliciousness and fun! There's plenty to check out on the walls while you wait for your grub, though you never have to wait long...the service team is a well-oiled machine!   I've eaten my way through most of the menu and I have never had a meal that disappointed me. Burgers are great--Mom loves the White Trash burger and I like mine Ding Dong style. Don't be afraid of it-- sounds gross, yet tastes amazing!! Order some Pimp'n fries or Crab Puppies to start and you won't need sides with your entree, though the sweet potato fries and black eyes pea salad are both great as well.  Also, daily specials are on the chalkboard behind the hostess stand--look for salmon tacos, which should be on the menu permanently because they're that yummy. You really can't go wrong, folks!  Good beer selection, and mixed drinks are plentiful and generously poured. Seating is available at the bar, booths, and inside and outside (lovely when they roll up the garage doors and open up the back dining room!). Only possible issue is parking. If you're not lucky enough to get one of the six or so spots in front, circle around on Morehead (heading away from uptown) and park in the gravel lot past the garage. A bit sketchy when muddy, but otherwise worth the trip (and the short walk).   Hands down, my favorite place to eat in this part of the Queen City. Consider it if you would like a delicious and deliciously affordable place to hang that's minutes from  uptown, hit up Pinky's and thank me later when you wake from your food coma!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at how good my lunch was today at Pinky's. I had the Big John chicken sandwich and homemade potato chips...yum, yum!! The sandwich was quite large with plenty of cheese and bacon on it. The chips had some sort of seasoning on them and weren't greasy in the least. Some people have commented that the music was too loud but I didn't think it was overbearing. You could have a conversation at your table, no problem. Service was good and fairly fast. I look forward to trying more things here based on this visit."}
{"text":"2 words: Pimpin fries. Home fries smothered in hot, delicious pimento cheese. You can never go wrong. The white trash burger, which comes with fried pickle, is also tdf. Coupled with regular beer specials and an awesome jukebox (wu-tang clan, anyone?), you just can't go wrong at Pinky's."}
{"text":"I love this west side staple! The Kinda Fried Turkey salad or sandwich is a fav of mine!   If you're having a drink, go for one of the hurricanes! They limit you to two, but you wouldn't need more than that.   The team wait staff makes it such that your needs are always met because you've got everyone looking at your cup to ensure it stays full!"}
{"text":"Great lunch locations with a hip vibe! The burgers and Tater tots are my favorite, more specifically the White Trash Burger. Service is ok - definitely not the best since your waiter seems to switch so you never know who is responsible for your table. The location is a little tight but still comfortable for a small groups of no more than 5. Parking is limited in front of the restaurant. You must park in the lot right before the restaurant."}
{"text":"We wanted a place to go watch the Hornets game and have dinner. The bartender was watching something else and had no problem changing the channel for us. We sat at the bar and shared crab puppies as an appetizer. They were so tasty and definitely a new favorite of mkne.  I ordered their soup of the day, minestrone. It was more of a southwest chili soup and I'm thinking they got the bowls mixed up. That doesn't take away from how good it was, but no way that was minestrone soup. For my entre, I ordered a shrimp salad with a side of honey mustard. Pinky's had a fun and hip environment, with lots of signs, art, and old-school games around. They have healthy food and fried food all in one."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my Thai-peanut chicken sandwich and service at the bar was great.  This area is known for good food.  If you're traveling through sprawling, nomadic-transient-populated Charlotte, and must be on 77, skip all the homogenized, suburban chains and head towards Lake Norman for good service and better food, in towns like Cornelius and Huntersville with their own identity and culture."}
{"text":"We had such great service today! Our waitress set up a table for 9 within ten minutes of us getting there and made my niece's birthday really special with a fancy coke, and a birthday cupcake. Awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome hush puppies great service wife loved it and I will go back!  The place is kinda a neat environment and the staff is all tatted up which adds to the cool factor."}
{"text":"If you're not used to team style service it might be off-putting at first but once you are accustomed to the concept you'll appreciate it.  Food is good, service is consistent.  Very kid friendly.  Reasonably priced and fun."}
{"text":"Where do I start? This place is delicious at an affordable price point! The service was immaculate. Not only was my assigned serve attentive, but the entire staff was aware of the entire restaurant, knowing when to take the check and moving in unbelievable unity. Thankyou for the experience. Also, for my fellow vegetarians, there were so many optiosn and ones that did not break the bank!"}
{"text":"Loved the \"vibe\" of this restaurant!!!  The food was good, service was good, clean bathrooms, good music playing...  pretty much everything was good!!  I had the chicken nuggets with cheese waffle fries and it was awesome!!  2 different managers came by to see how we were enjoying our meal. I could tell that everyone working there really took pride in it.  We were seated immediately and served quickly! Would definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in the area!!"}
{"text":"We walked in to a nearly full indoor and half full outdoor seating area.  We were seated immediately in the section we preferred and had drinks quickly.  I saw 4 or 5 things in every section of the menu I wanted to eat immediately.  My wife ordered pimento cheese fries for an app and a chicken philly for lunch.  I got two buffalo shrimp tacos and my mother in law got a chicken sandwich.  The fries came up fast and were just great. Sandwiches were out promptly and all of the food was top notch.  Your bill is about the same as Applebee's, but the food is thrice as good and the atmosphere makes for the kinda place you want to have extra beers at.  Great music, friendly staff, real rock music.  F#*% that's delicious."}
{"text":"Very close to home which is a bonus. Good drinks! Outside patio for seating. Lots of finger foods, nothing wowed me!"}
{"text":"I had the Nature Boy black bean burger...  OMG!!! Absolutely delicious!  Great seasoning and and sauce."}
{"text":"My hubby wanted to try this place out because of Triple D on the Food Network and I've eaten at both locations before, so I was pretty excited to dine here again.  The menu consists of a wide variety of choices from vegan dishes (salads, hot dogs, chili, burgers, etc) to seafood (crab puppies, corn dog shrimp, etc), variety of tacos (chicken, fish, shrimp, korean bbq), and other dishes (chicken philly, chicken sandwiches, corn dogs, hot dogs, salads, etc) and of course the burgers!  Oh yeah and the fried pickles among other appetizers (wings, hummus, shrimp, etc).   So... I give it 3 stars due to the service as we waited quite awhile after our drinks were delivered and couldn't locate our waitress to place an order for an appetizer.  She finally came back and asked were we ready to order and I stated we would like to order an appetizer first, please.  Luckily our appetizer (fried pickles) came out pretty quickly and it was quite tasty, so it sufficed. Another waitress came to take our order for our entrees and she seemed much more pleasant and a little more enthused than our previous waitress.  My husband ordered the Mammoth burger and I ordered the White Trash burger with waffle fries.  Again, our food was cooked and delivered to our table much sooner than expected, so things started to look better from there.  After awhile, finally someone came to check on us and refilled our drinks and it became consistent after that.  My only wish is that the service we received near the end of our visit was the same at the beginning of our visit.  It takes alot for my husband to be turned off from a place, but he stated the service did it for him.  I guess we'll dine at the Morehead location from now on."}
{"text":"Friday Night = Calories Don't Count Night. Pinky's is awesome, plain and simple. Grab a local beer (we went super local with Blue Blaze's  Pink Blaze) and definitely get the crab puppies - so good. So many burger options paired with a super chill, laid back atmosphere makes for an awesome dinner out."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, waiters were amazing, absolutely no complaints. No doubt 5 star place."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the atmosphere.  It's loud and fun, plenty of people that are tatted up.  Great burgers, great onion rings and great fried pickles. If your looking for good food and a place with personality this is it."}
{"text":"Normally Yelp leads me to places I really like while I'm traveling for work, but unfortunately, I wasn't all that impressed by Pinky's.   The ambiance was neat - this diner-ish place is housed in a converted gas station. Loved the music that was playing and the smorgasbord of options on the menu. But my food was just meh.   Started out with veggie chili. It was ok, but nothing special. Split the falafel balls and the friend pickles with a coworker. The falafel balls seemed pretty flavorless to me and in contrast, the fried pickles were way too salty. (and this is coming from a girl who drinks pickle juice, so that tells you how salty they were)   I had a very unmemorable veggie sandwich on pita bread. I may be spoiled because where I live, fresh pita is served just about everywhere, but their pita tasted like the wonder bread of pita.   My coworker had the fish tacos. We'd been to a place the night before with really amazing tacos (hello, Krazy Fish) so he wasn't all that impressed wither.   I was also a little put off by all of the plastic/styrofoam dinnerware. I understand that they're going for the divey kind of atmosphere, but...I thought I was going to puncture my plate at one point.   Overall, this was a sub par experience. I think this would be the kind of place I'd like to drink at...but I don't think I'd ever go back for food. But at least the drive to Pinky's allowed me to see a lot of the city!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is always on point. Try the pimento chili cheese fries, you won't regret it. We eat here every time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Extremely cheap and tons of amazing options  My favorite items:   Korean tacos - just amazing.  Best taco in CLT and this is from a guy who loves Cabo Fish Taco Pimping fries - forget the bacon just stick to the pimento cheese - these are to die for Falafel sandwich - can be a bit dry for some, needs hot sauce, but it's really good with that The burgers are awesome.  The garbage burger is a personal favorite. The crab cake hushpuppies are perfect. The banana pudding is top notch as well.  The only thing I have ever had there I didn't like was the corn dog shrimp."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim - new to Charlotte and trying new places.  Saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives!  DAMN!!!!! Must get the (homemade) pimento cheese and (homemade) chili waffle fries- I can assure you, you will not be disappointed. I got the kickin-chicken tacos and I can honestly say I have never had anything better!  I ordered 2 and could only eat one! There is some kind of bean mixture served on the side that will make you want to take a gallon home! Hubs got the hot dog with chili and pimento cheese- guess the fries weren't enough! ;) Food is top notch but they don't stop there! The service is like none other- you don't have just one server- you have the whole service team! Extreme attentiveness without being obnoxious! Atmosphere is laid back and upbeat! We will DEFINITELY be back!!"}
{"text":"Hello Friday! It's lunch hour. My CoWorkers and I decided to check this place out.   My first time visiting!   Let's start with parking. Non existent. Your subjected to parking behind the building then walking up. Trust me you'll need the exercise after eating here. The inside is relatively small, we had a party of 8, decided to split up into 2 groups.   I wouldn't advise coming here during the busy lunch traffic. The wait time is between 15-25mins which is expected.   After being seated, we quickly ordered. I had the White Trash Burger and the Crab Hushpuppies. The White Trash burger lacked flavor. I added sriracha thinking this would help.... Nope! Felt like I was eating Wonder Bread with sriracha....But hell I was hungry so I ate it. Now the Crab Hushpuppies were AMAZING! I saw heaven with every bite! I spent about $12 on my meal.  Not bad!  Yes, I'm willing to try this place again. The grill grilled cheese is next on my list! Until next time ..."}
{"text":"PINKYS!!!!!!! OMG I cannot get enough. This place is probably one of my favorites in Charlotte! Everything from the funky decor, to the funky foods, to the fun/excited employees keep me coming back. I have yet to have a bad meal here or experience. The food is soooo good. I got the white trash burger and it was like heaven in my mouth! I am a big burger person and this definitely hit the spot. We also got the hush puppies and cheese fries with pimento cheese for sides/appetizers which also did not disappoint. I love that the menu has so many options, so really whatever you are in the mood for you can get at Pinky's, including vegetarian options! The cocktails are fantastic as well, I got a mojito and it was refreshing and strong! This is definitely my go to place and definitely a must for when you have guests in town and want to show them some really great Charlotte restaurants!"}
{"text":"It's good to see that Pinky's has finally got it together.  This is reviewing the take out at Pinky's.  After having two take-out orders previously, we (3 of us from work) were very disappointed in the quality of food vs the price.   This time was a welcome change as the food was hot, fresh, correct, and very tasty.  Since we use to make the trek to the penguin, one would expect a few changes and breaking in period before the same level of quality would be reached here at Pinky's......well, let me tell you, the food is good!  My secret to having takeout is to place the order between 11:00 - 11:20am , that way you are one of the first ones to be in the restaurant when the other folks are just getting ready to head to lunch.  No lines, no looking for parking spaces, but let me assure you, eating at that early time slot takes some getting use to unless you are still in high school where lunch starts around 10:45am.  So I had the mammoth burger, 2-5 oz patties, with provolone cheese and bacon.  My Grease-O-Meter was running hot, and there is just nothing like having a big huge piece of hot meat in your mouth with a little cheese and bacon, oozing out of the corner of your mouth......OMG that sounded kinda gross when you read that didn't it.  (SORRY) we are talking about the burger!  My co-worker had the buffalo bites, I stole one from his plate while I was bringing the food back to work, and I must say that was delicious! Ssshhh don't say anything, but I had to ask him how they were, so he offered (another) chicken bite so that I may taste it. Just like the first one, it was excellent! I would consider the buffalo chicken bites next time as it did come with fries, unlike the burgers.    I give these guys a fighting chance.....after all you have to be tough to have a name like Pinky's on the West Side of Charlotte.  Overall, this location has greatly improved. I am only speaking of the takeout as I just do not have enough time at lunch to dine in and review the service of a full meal.  If you like the Penguin, you'll get a the same type of feeling here, good food, small space, no parking, long lines, and yes, some pricey food.    Located (For us cool kids ....across the street from \"The Pterodactyl Club\")  (Now bulldozed and no longer a part of the scenery - RIP)  Located for the newbies to Charlotte, at the corner of Morehead St and the intersection of Freedom Dr.  NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"Who doesn't LOVE Pinky's??? Yeah, I can't think of anyone either! The food here is so good.  Love both locations.  (My go to is the salads.. Their ranch is to die for!!!) Staff is awesome and you definitely get fairly quick service here."}
{"text":"Three words: Ding Dong Burger. One of the best things about Pinky's is the opportunity to order a 5 oz burger a la carte for under $5. The Ding Dong Burger is by far the best of the lot: slathered with peanut butter, honey cilantro slaw, and Sriracha, it is a wonderful expression of Asian-inspired flavor.   You may ask yourself, \"That title, though... am I eating a racist burger?\" The answer, as it turns out, is no: http://www.thai-language.com/forums/t/translation/basic/t7168  Anyway, Pinky's is a gem of a place. Divey, cheap, fun, and delicious. The beer and drink specials will treat your wallet with kid gloves while the food, most of it heavily fried, will make your waistline expand. But, the flavors are worth it, goddammit. They have these awesome crab hush puppies of which you can't just eat one. They serve delicious local dishes, like fried squash and fried pickles. They have some awesome all-beef hot dogs. They feature a variety of local beers for next to no money.   AND! They're open till 11 pm on a Sunday! Perfect for late eaters like me."}
{"text":"Pimpn fries were awesome, servers and staff were friendly, however I decided I wanted to try the Reuben veggie dog (I don't eat meat and have been missing hot dogs!) and when I ended up not liking it I told the server who went and got a woman who I'm guessing was the manager. She came to the table and said \"was something wrong with the veggie dog?\" And I said I'm sorry I just didn't care for it. She gave me a disapproving look and then said \"well have you ever had a veggie dog?\" I said no I wanted to try it though. She said \"oh... ok...\" I am a server and would never make anyone feel bad for wanting to try something new and not liking it. Will probably not be back."}
{"text":"All we had here was the banana pudding. It was delish. But must get it to share. The helping is huge!!! Just pure insanity. It was very tasty though. I would've willing to go back and try real food so my rating is based solely on the pudding.  I will have to add to this review if I go back and try anything off the real menu."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!  I've never been here - this was a Sunday afternoon where-do-we-eat-and-avoid-the-after-church-lunch-crowd idea.  And now it's my new favorite!  Our dishes were great! White trash burger. Awesome - fried pickles and onion rings were battered well and not at all greasy - the beef was perfectly seasoned. The spicy ranch was delish!  The fish tacos were equally terrific with tasty, fresh ingredients.  Service was spot on.  The servers all worked every table as a team, which definitely contributed to the fantastic vibe.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.   The outdoor eating area was perfect and the overall decor was truly unique and fun.    Cool, quirky and definitely a treasure, I can't wait to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"If you have ever seen Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives, then you probably will recognize this little joint. Pinky's Westside Grill is located in Charlotte and Huntersville. We ended up stopping at an off time so we could make sure we got a table. When we walked in, the atmosphere was so fun and casual. They have so many cool things on the walls that you could probably go 100 times and find a new thing every time.  It was so hard to choose because everything looked so amazing, most of the items on the menu were very interesting because its hard to imagine what a corndog shrimp looks like. We ended up ordering a bunch of things; we got the Pinky Dog, Pimp'N Fries, and the White Trash Burger. If you couldn't tell we got a little excited about Chili. The White Trash Burger was probably my favorite because I loved the fried pickles on top. The drink I had was the Wedding punch, it had Absolut Citron, Amaretto, Melon Liquor, House Made Sour & Pineapple Juice. It was a very light refreshing drink to go with all that heavy Chili. I recommend if you are ever in the area to try out Pinky's. It will definitely be a place I will go again!"}
{"text":"Had a great time with my family. Loved the food and drinks. We ordered the popcorn chicken salad which was enough for 2 people. The chicken patsy melt was delicious and White trash burger was yummy. The tacos were little messy but it was good. We were seated in the patio outside and the environment was refreshing. They offer good selection of local beers as well."}
{"text":"The place has a biker type vibe to it to me. All the female waiters are tatted up (some from the legs up)! They made the guys appear soft. Lol. The service was nice. Not much of a smile but good. Guy Fieri from the Food Network must have been here quite a bit and have autograph pictures and other items displayed in the place. I had The White Trash burger! Yeah the name of the burger made it sound like I got it from a trailer park BBQ right... Lol. It was juicy and fresh but not as flavorful as I would like it. The fries were, well FRIES! Nothing special about them. The food came out fast. Obviously the place is a local favorite because it filled up very fast. All in all I might try it again."}
{"text":"The pimpin fries are good. They have pretty good burgers too! You really can't mess up fried pickles so those were also good. The banana pudding it's also pretty good. But I when there one night or some pimpin fries and I was waiting 20 minutes and I was like what's taking so long.. I go and check on it and it was just sitting there. And the person didn't even apologize or the long wait. But I'm not going to let that one experience make me not go back though."}
{"text":"Waitress was super friendly and accomodating. We highly recommend the chili and slaw hot dog!"}
{"text":"As much as I love Pinky's in Charlotte... this Pinky's is definitely a great option should you find yourself in Huntersville or the surrounding areas.  The first difference you will notice between this location and Charlotte is the abundance of parking spaces.  When you turn off of Gilead Road and into the shopping center, there is a nice sized lot for the stores that the Huntersville Pinky's shares its digs with.  When you walk in, there is a nice reception area and we were warmly greeted by the nice staff.  We got there around noon so it was peak lunch time and there were people already seated in booths and in the tables outside on their patio area.  Great space overall... high ceilings and wide aisles.  Of course the menu is the same as the Charlotte menu so you can get your favorite burgers, dogs, sandwiches AND sides here.  For this first luncheon here, I had the Jive Turkey Burger... and fried squash.  Yes, I know... trying to be \"healthy\" but I think the fried squash pretty much offset any sort of \"healthy\" I was achieving.  We also ordered waffle fries with the pimento cheese and bacon (which are heavenly delicious... and also may make you see heaven sooner than later, but well worth it - In my opinion).  Any time fries have forks inserted into them, you know you are going to have a good time and Pinky's is super serious about their fries.  Definitely will need to make this a regular lunch option for myself.  Great for families too.. there's a kid's arcade and the servers are super accommodating with the little ones.  My one comment would be to add a kids section to the menu since all the servings usually a ton of food."}
{"text":"Great place!  Been wanting to make my way here for the longest time, but actually went last Saturday when I happened to be in the neighborhood.  First thing that you get hit with before you even set foot in Pinky's is the character the place offers.  I think a couple of years back, people were trying to save the location since it had become an \"eyesore.\"  Pinky's has a trademark volkswagon on it's roof (lookin' sharp with a new paint job) and I am really happy to see that they kept the original volkswagon service sign out front.  Other outdoor items to note are the large garage doors that can be opened during good weather... makes for a really cool eating place and indoor/outdoor space.  My other personal favorite is the triceratops statue sitting out in front of the building.  I was a sucker for triceratops as a little kid and apparently I am still a little kid since I am a sucker for it now.  The food:  We were immediately greeted and seated and beers magically appeared on the table.  I decided to try the popcorn chicken basket since I was feeling hungry and craving some waffle fries.  The food came out quickly and was devoured quickly... hitting all the right spots.  I was a little less adventurous my first trip, but I plan to make a triumphant return and try the more exotic/unique menu items!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times.. And everything is delicious. But today we had the hushpups with tarter sauce ( yeah i thought the same thing, tarter sauce??...) But they were the best hushpups i have had in charlotte.  We also had the fish and shrimp tacos and they were AMAZING!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, I like the funky vibe the place gives kinda surfer/skateboard ish. I had a turkey burger it was unbelievably good."}
{"text":"I know everyone loves Pinky's but my experiences here have just been ok.  The food is decent.  I've had the fried pickles, the Corn dog shrimp, the Westside randy and a few other things. The Westside randy was the best of the bunch.    The beer list was completely off on my most recent visit.  Why have a laminated beer list if you're out of everything on the list?  Seems like a waste of money to me when just a regular paper list would be easier to reprint and cheaper. But oh well.    Service is ok here. Nothing exceptional. They take your order, tell you they are out of the first 3 beers you selected, and they bring your food out.    At the lack of parking doesn't make this place somewhere I want to visit often.  I actually preferred the Huntersville location which I also visited recently."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. The food is always a hit. My go-to orders are the: Kinda Fried Turkey sandwich, Pimpin' Fries or the Fish Tacos. I never get tired of it. Their specials are good too. I usually end up at Pinky's once a week or every other week and it never disappoints. The waitstaff is tremendous, the atmosphere is cool, and they have a pretty cool beer and cocktails selection. And the prices are very reasonable too. A+"}
{"text":"So good!! The burgers are out of this world. Hotdogs are also delicious and the margaritas were great. They have great drink specials daily as well!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Fun, quirky atmosphere, friendly and great service, and absolutely delicious food. Tip: parking lot can be tough, so (after 10am) you can park across the street in the Dunkin Donuts parking lot."}
{"text":"Pinky's is a good spot to head when you're hungover on New Year's Day.  There was about a 20 minute wait since I guess everyone else had the same idea, but the tantalizing smells made it all worth it.  We were both hungry so we ordered a large basket of fried pickles.  Because it was so busy, we were seated next to another couple at a table that could hold a 4-top.  However, they ordered a small basket of fried pickles, and our orders were delivered to one another.  Luckily, the small basket wasn't small at all, so we were fine with it.  Any more would have been too many fried pickles, anyway.  They were perfectly fried, the batter was nice and crispy, and the pickles were juicy and salty.  I had requested a side of spicy ranch, which worked perfectly with them, but they otherwise came unadorned.  I think they should at least be served with some kind of dipping sauce.  For my meal, I got a Mammoth burger (two patties) with everything (mayo, LTO, pickles), cheddar cheese, and some fresh jalapenos.  The menu states that all burgers are cooked to medium well, a shade above the medium I normally like my burgers, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  They absolutely nailed it - this was the best burger I'd had in years.  The patties were perfectly seasoned, and they must use a lot of fat in their grind because even cooked to medium well, they were very very juicy.  The jalapenos lightened the burger and added some welcome kick.  I would eat one of these burgers every day if it wouldn't give me heart disease.  For my side I got onion rings, which the server warned were \"cut really thin\", which I was fine with.  The problem here is that they weren't onion rings...they were onion straws.  No rings to be found.  The onions were cut so thinly that it was mostly batter, and after sitting in the container for a few minutes while I enjoyed my burger, they kind of steamed to a soft consistency and weren't terribly enjoyable so I only ate about half of them.  I'd recommend either renaming them onion straws on the menu to avoid misleading the clientele, or adjusting the recipe so they're actually rings of onion.  Remember how our pickles order got messed up with the other couple at our table?  The same exact thing happened with our entrees as well.  Luckily we easily resolved it, but it was still a slight misstep.  Overall, this was a very encouraging first trip and I will definitely be back.  Aside from a couple bumps in the road for the service, and the underwhelming onion straws, the burger was so amazingly good that it was enough to earn them four stars.  Iron out the other issues and I'd gladly award all five."}
{"text":"My girls loved their meals. One had a patty melt and loved it!  My other daughter got the popcorn chicken meal and loved it as well.  My husband got the chicken tacos and said it was OK. I think we would try the Korean BBQ tacos next time.  The service was great!"}
{"text":"Great place with a variety in the menu   Doesn't disappoint.  Kids eats FREE Monday so can't beat that.  Can't go wrong trying this place.  So much good food."}
{"text":"Pinky's has awesome food, great prices and unprofessional, unpleasant service. Ive been embarrassed to bring my friends and family here because the service  is some of the worst I've ever experienced. And it's consistent. I'll get to the positive first. The food is fantastic, it's simple and humble but everything I've had is delicious. Especially as a vegetarian, Pinky's has tons of options that you can't usually find at other restaurants. Their veggie burger is great but my go to is the Stray Dog, a sweet potato hot dog with vegetarian chili, onions and slaw. It is SO good, it's been a long time since I've had a real hot dog but I'm pretty sure the Stray Dog tastes just like the real thing. Also for sides, their red potato salad is great, so are their potato chips. The entire menu is really affordable as well, with a meal with sides usually coming to around $10. But all is not well. I've been coming to Pinky's to eat for a couple years now, ignoring the subpar and unfriendly service that I just deemed to be expected from Pinky's. The food and atmosphere made up for it. But I just can't do it anymore. I'm sure I'll eat Pinkys again in the future but it will have to be To-go. The servers are so consistently rude and inefficient that I just don't want to leave another lunch or dinner feeling worse than when I came in. It's as if it's an employment requirement that you must appear disinterested and annoyed at all times. Servers have a permanent scowl and they make the dining experience uncomfortable for me and my party time and time again. Just today I was having lunch with my sister when a larger, older, red haired female server brought our fried pickles out. We had just ordered and finished another order of fried pickles previously but ordered a second. When she put it down I asked if we could please get another two ranches for the pickles. She LITERALLY rolled her eyes and cut me off to say \"they're .75\" i politely explained to her that I never received any ranch to go with my second order and she walked off while I was talking I was slightly stunned because she was so abrasively rude when I was just making a simple request. I have been a server myself for years and the way the majority of the servers here are is laughable. Lastly, I dropped my debit card on the ground and my sister put it on the table for me. a waiter walked by and interrupted my conversation to say \"is that you prompting me to take my payment??\" And pointed at my card. I was SO shocked and embarrassed that he would be so confrontational to me. I said \"no, I just dropped it on the floor and picked it up but I'm ready for the check now if it's convenient\" and he walked away with out saying anything. As a server if my table had a card out on their table i would simply ask \"are you ready for your check?\" He was so nasty and unfriendly for NO reason. It's maddening the way that no care is paid to service here at pinky's, napkins and sauces are often forgotten as well and drinks are left to go empty. I wish I could just not be a patron of theirs at all but the food is just too good."}
{"text":"What a treasure this place is.  If you've tried fried pickles, maybe at a county fair or similar cultural event, this is the best place in Charlotte I've found thus far for them.  And it's not just those - sweet potato fries, waffle fries, huge glistening chicken breast filets on a sandwich bun...  It's comfort food in all its greasy fried goodness, open late, with great - I mean great - wait staff.  Managing lots of tables with ease, refilling your drinks on or ahead of time, and not making a peep when you come in 15 minutes before the official closing time.    Prices are very affordable, some even surprising.  It's got a definite vibe to it, with tattoos aplenty, oddball music choices, college kids tossed in, and food names and descriptions that hold nothing back.  It's an experience, and a good one.  They even offer vegetarian choices, and quite a few of them - odd for the greasy menu, but still a welcomed attribute.    It does leave you wanting a bit less grease - you might feel sick if you consume more than half of a large fried pickle, for instance - but you know it's worth it.  Could use a few more 'normal' menu options, but I can't complain - they do what they do, and they do it very well.    Find it, stop in, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.. would definitely come back.. had the Korean taco and the burger very good... we had a few Mojito perfect"}
{"text":"Funky Spunky Food with some southern charm! Love this joint because it's always full of characters and the food is flav-o-matic!   Owners are from the infamous Penguin which ruled Charlotte tastebuds for a decade. Make sure to try the fried pickles, donkey style burgers, and don't be afraid to try something new. We love this divey food mecca and will always make a special trip for Pinky's!"}
{"text":"I came here while visiting Charlotte on the suggestion of my sister, who went to school in the area. Pinky's was one of her favorite go-to spots to eat. She always raves about the food here! So when I was planning my trip here, she insisted on me making Pinky's one of my stops.  The food was pretty good. I love any place that actually serves good fried pickles. I ordered the buffalo chicken salad as my meal, though I'm not quite sure why as I'm not a big fan of spicy food at all. But aside from that, the food was really good. I would have wished I ordered something else just because it was very spicy.  It's a small restaurant, and you're in very close proximity with your table neighbors. You can hear a lot of conversations outside of your own this way."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place, I go by this place often when visiting family.  I wanted to go in one day but wasn't too sure about the people.  But today I gave them a chance and I went in well I ordered my phone to go because I was told how awesome it was.  Well it didn't disappoint me at all, the fried pickles were amazing reminded me of the pickles at penguins.  The hot dog I had was a true southern hot dog, just amazing.  The staff were very nice very nice people, it was crowded but worth me going in to experience the food even if it was to go.  Great job, love it."}
{"text":"Quite the place.  Went for the Asian Pork burger.  Unfortunately that is only a special item.  Went with the Triple D instead.  Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Pinky's serves what I would consider comfort, delicious bar food all for a very affordable price. It is amazing how little you spend here to get a massive amount of food. If you need to cure a hangover or are out late at night and need quick bite, Pinky's is a must try. We ordered the pimpin' fries as one of the appetizers, and it was awesome. Don't think twice and order these perfectly seasoned, crispy waffle fries covered in melty pimento cheese and huge, crunchy pieces of bacon. The waffle fries were crispy down to the last bite even though they were covered in cheese and bacon. We also had the crab hush puppies, and it comes with thirteen big hush puppy balls with good lumps of crab meat cooked throughout. They were very filling and were delicious with the tarter sauce to dip.  For my entree, I ordered the Pinky Dog, which was a hot dog with pimento cheese and chili. The hot dog was a decent size and along with two appetizers, was plenty of food for me. The chili was meaty and hot, really giving the hot dog some great flavor. The pimento cheese wasn't as prominent in flavor because of the chili, but you did get some melty gooieness underneath from it. Overall, I had a great lunch at Pinky's and really enjoyed there awesome food all for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a Saturday lunch here. Went for the The Nature Boy burger and The Patsy Melt .. they were really good. their home made chips with ranch dip are also good.. the ambience and staff were very welcoming"}
{"text":"Fair Priced, great, amazing food.  Not sure why I cant do 5 stars but i think it has to do with the lack of \"plating\", I get the concept but theres so much good food and no where to put it."}
{"text":"What a funky little spot! The menu has so many great and different combinations. They out items together that you would never expect and they are amazing. I always order the corn dog shrimp! Who would've thought of that!? I'm glad they did!  I'm a huge fan of the white trash burger - pimento cheese, fried pickles & onion rings. Messy and delicious.  They also make the best sauces. The last time we went I tried the spicy ranch and the wasabi ranch. Both were great choices. I dipped everything in them.  The service is always great. The place is always busy but the service never slips. Everyone is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"So this was my first time here and it was awesome! We sat outside and the vibe was so beachy and California like! Food was amazing and service friendly and helpful. I had the pterodactyl with sweet potato fries (which come with honey mustard--a combination I never thought of but was so delicious!) and my fiancé had the mammoth. We will definitely be visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"Nothing but love for Pinky's. I've been back many times since having the gross shrimp and everything I've had has been delicious. This place will always be a top 5."}
{"text":"OMG! Son.. Have you been here yet? No???!!! What's wrong with you? Didn't you see the front page picture of that sandwich? It doesn't lie and neither does the food sinking happily into your stomach. I can see where this place may not be for everyone. Namely the parking.. but.. wow. I'm not sure where to start. Perhaps with the White Trash Burger? LOL Take your calories and leave them outside. It's like diner food on the back of a Harley Davidson filled with jet fuel. Pretty cool right? I know!  This is a bar and a restuarant. There is seating outside if the weather is nice. I've even seen some hipsters bring their kids in. It's not the quietest of places so be aware of that prior to coming in."}
{"text":"Why have I waited this long to try this place!?!  I stopped here today with a colleague and I was beyond impressed with the quality of food, ambiance, and attentiveness of the wait staff.  We ordered the Fried Pickles and the Pimento Cheese Fries as appetizers, both of which were full of flavor and cooked just right.  There were so many things on the menu that I wanted to try but figured I had to go with a burger on my first trip.  I ended up deciding on the Mammoth Westside Burger that had mustard, chili, slaw, and onions.  For some reason 5 oz. sounded really small so i ordered the Mammoth which had two 5 oz. patties.  Anyone else wondering the same thing, one patty would have been plenty!  Don't get me wrong the Mammoth was really, really good, but it was definitely a lot of meat.  I'm a huge fan of a restaurant that can get away with playing heavy metal music and not have it take away from the total experience.  From the artwork hanging on the wall to the slug bug on the roof, this place is definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.  I've read some reviews about people getting sick (my wife was one of them!) but it's been about 10 hours now since eating there and I've had no issue.  I guess check back in a few days to see if I've updated my review :)"}
{"text":"The food here is consistently great.  The menu has a few quirky options and of course the staples any diner style place would have.  It's quick and easy and a great option if you don't have a lot of time."}
{"text":"Five stars. Yeah I know, right? Five stars for solid food. Good, cheap, delicious food. Five stars for atmosphere. Average service, but I won't let that detract.  FOOD: Kinda Fried Turkey Sandwich is amazing, flavorful, delicious,  and huge. Also, the sweet potato fries are great, and you get a laaaarge amount. They really do have an extensive menu, and there were so many things I wanted to try, and vow to try in the future.  ATMOSPHERE: Hipster and awesome, but still comfortable enough for a bunch of business men to get drunk on their lunch break (gotta love those close-knit tables). Only downside? Shittah parking.  SERVICE: As attentive as she could be, considering the place was packed to the gills. Had to flag her down a few times, but that was to be expected. The ladies I was with did not appreciate her holding their bowls of soup by the lip, but that's not something I particularly care about in general.  PRICE: Very decent. I am appreciative.  Overall: NOMNOMNOOOOOOOM!"}
{"text":"This place has tasty and fresh food, neat decor and wonderful staff. They worked with our group of 7 during a lunch rush by taking our order before we were sat and ringing up separate checks right away! Try the waffle fries or a burger!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot! Recommend the fried pickles and tuna melt... Amazing! Service could be a bit more professional in front of customers, but overall efficient."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars because it's A-Ok!  I had a burger and fried pickles here the other night.  My friend had a pita of sorts, but I cant remember which one.  I just recall that it was very bland and Thousand Island dressing was needed to give it a little kick.  My burger was pretty good  but not out of this world great.  The fried pickles were average as well; not awesome but good!"}
{"text":"Love Pinky's! Always fun, always super yummy, good service and consistent! Consistency matters, especially when you're doing this kind of food and Pinky's does it right. The staff is great. Even if there is a wait to be seated we love getting the excuse to play some pinball or take some pictures in their photo booth.  Service is always friendly and I've been going here since they opened. I've literally never had anything but a really great time. The food is made with love. Pinky's does a great job of balancing their menu to make everyone happy. They have really good burgers (my boyfriend's favorite in the city) and equally yummy vegetarian options.   Good cocktails, big portions, quality ingredients and delicious food in a fun atmosphere. So glad we have Pinky's!"}
{"text":"This review is going to be short because we ordered our food to go.  On the night I arrived, there were a bunch of bikers and \"progressively\" dressed gals.  The parking lot was blocked off but motorcycles can squeeze around the barriers.  The food was reasonably priced and was prepared pretty quickly (10-15 minutes at most).    My wife had the popcorn chicken and it was pretty mediocre to be honest.  You really had to douse it in ketchup and ranch to give it the moisture/flavor it needed.  It was dry, light on the breading, and light on the crunch.  It also came with waffle-fries and those were of less seasoned and crunchy than the ones I've had at Carl's Jr.    I had the Falafel Wrap with Hummus for about $7.  It was pretty yummy, and was definitely better than the popcorn chicken, but it wasn't impressively yummy.  I regret not going with the White Trash burger like everybody else.  I'll definitely be back here to try some more of their food because it seems like a popular, and affordable place but for now, I'd only be able to give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Right after our big honeymoon trip (more on that soon) and after a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner the day before, Calvin, my dad and I decided to check out Pinky's Westside Grill in Charlotte on West Morehead Avenue. This neighborhood is undergoing a pretty significant awakening and I'm excited to try some of the other newbies in the neighborhood also.  Pinky's serves a good burger and offers several eclectic twists, both on their burgers and other menu items that make it stand out as a causal dining joint. In addition to the tasty beef burgers, Pinky's serves hot dogs, falafel, veggie/turkey burgers and various baskets, salads and sandwiches as well. I look forward to returning to try the corn dog shrimp, the falafel and the \"kinda fried turkey\" sandwich.  We all tried the basic burger (the Pterodactyl), which is only available one temperature (per NC law a burger cannot be prepared rare anyway). At $3.75 (without a side but including generous toppings) it is a good value. We each tried a different topping style. Topping styles include Everything (mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion & dill pickle), Westside (mustard, chili, slaw and onion) and Ding-Dong Style (crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce). I tried the Ding-Dong Style and loved it! Of course, having come from Thailand it was rather ironic that the waiter described it as their \"Thai style\" burger. We also shared some crab puppies as an appetizer - sweet crabmeat folded into large hush puppies and side orders of southern slaw, onion rings (more like straws) and fried squash. The sides didn't really stand out - the onion rings and squash were sliced too thin for my taste but maybe others like them this way. I preferred the cilantro-honey slaw on the burger to the southern style slaw. The only other negative is that the place is rather loud, although not as bad as some. I look forward to dining here again on the patio when the weather warms up in the spring!"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough. We had the vegan chili, the onion Strings as appetizers. The BBQ sauce is amazing & the chili was sweet with a spicy kick at the end.  We then had the kickin' chicken tacos which were delicious. Chicken was juicy and the pico de gallo was so flavorful.  We also had the pterodactyl Burger with everything on it including the housemade pimento cheese. The burger was juicy & flavorful. Highly recommend this fun place with a super cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pinky's is a favorite! I was introduced to Pinky's when I asked around for different restaurants in the Charlotte area. I went once or twice and enjoyed it. My fiancé loves this place so when we began dating it became a regular for us. A good selection of burgers with different taste from simple to pimento cheese and fried pickles to peanut butter (it's good trust me!). Get the fried pickles if that's your thing...really good. Word of advice though they will not seat you until your whole party is there. That's never really an issue as I think the longest I've waited on a Friday Saturday or Sunday night was 15-20 minutes but if you have a large party it's just something to consider. Really love this place and consider it a must visit for friends and family when they come to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Not a place for picky eaters! Not much on the menus here that normal people like. Everything seems weird. Service needs some help...smile would be nice...not friendly and takes forever for someone to even take your drink order. Avoid this place if you only have an hour for lunch."}
{"text":"Dear Reader,   I'm going to tell you a magical love story. It doesn't involve unicorns making love to heart shaped clouds, or cupid shooting arrows at Cleopatra, but  something similarly fantastic. It wasn't  When Harry met Sally but  rather when Corndog met Shrimpy. Something incredible happened that day, It was kismet I tell you.   A plump sweet corn-dog coating on top of succulent shrimp with an array of dipping sauces for your consumptive pleasure. All of this nestled in bed with crisp waffle fries galore ...they were just begging for it (malt vinegar that is). Wash it all down with a refreshing Crispin cider on tap...and you have one banging meal. That's right, I said it...this meal is not for Pinky's virgins!   But alas I was until this day, and rest assured I'll be back...because you never forget your first!  Yours Truly,  One Satisfied Yelper!"}
{"text":"While the food is SERIOUSLY greasy, it isn't half bad.  I like the sweet potato fries the best.  But the food is seriously, seriously greasy.  Best eaten with beer.  I'm only giving this 2 stars because the service is awful and the booth seating is cramped.  I ended up switching to take out because my waitress was so rude to me when she finally came over to take my order. I don't plan on ever coming back, but I give the owner credit.  He is totally professional, and runs an overall good business, but I don't know where he hired his wait staff from.  I wouldn't recommend coming here at night to hang out unless you're into the whole biker, tattoo thing.  That's the crowd I always see drinking there and it can get a little ghetto on the weekend nights.  Even the waitresses look like that.  Just not my crowd, but it could be your thing."}
{"text":"Real vegan dogs along with several other choices. Has an older divey appearance with a long wait."}
{"text":"Amazing burger joint! Here are some of the highlights:  -You don't have one server. All servers circulate throughout the restaurant helping patrons. They share the tips. -The Ding Dong Way is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. If you're going to add cheese, I'd recommend going with a more mild cheese like provolone.  -$2.50 drafts on Thursday.  -Pimento cheese fries with the option of adding chili or bacon. Make sure to get a side of their ranch for dipping!  -Parking is behind the building/right around the corner."}
{"text":"So I was sitting in traffic wondering why Charlatans can't figure out \"merge\" so pretty good when I got a call saying \"Flight's delayed!?!\" Yea for me! Ten minute detour and I arrived at the great northern Pinky's for snacks and silver ball (except that there was a young feller playing it...(Lord of the Rings)) It was a nice day so I elected to sit and dine on the umbrella bedecked veranda. I asked for coffee and water and fish tacos and beans as I sat back to watch people come and go down the walk. The boy and his father were having way too much fun playing pinball so I sat outside with my coffee which never quite got empty or cold (thanks kids!!) My food arrived at about the time the guys left the pinball so I kinda missed out there. Three soft tortillas each topped with a nice crispy battered stick of fishy goodness and multi-colored slaw and some random hot sauce accompanied by seasoned and herbed and scallioned black beans. No desert that day, still had to go fetch my lovely smoochy-face bride from the airport and that's all the sweet I'll ever need :-) Yea servers! who were pleasant and present with beverage, or napkins, or check, or whatever I needed. Have to stop back in for a go at the pinball and maybe a sandwich."}
{"text":"So I'm picking my wife up at the airport and remember she's been planing around for 6 hours and will probably be way hungry and I don't know where to get good food near here. so I ask the lady at hourly parking: Pinky's she says, 10 minutes away she says, does great burgers she says... so I get there and ask what's the two most popular burgers they sell. \"White Trash burger\" and \"Patsy Melt\" - 'Oy! cute names,' I think and prepare to be underwhelmed, but the place smells good, and there's pin ball, and I'm already here, so one of each plus onion things. Got back to CLT on time to meet my wife at baggage claim and we thoroughly enjoyed the simple goodness of onion strings and fried pickles on a cheese burger plus more onion strings... Had that P-melt cold for breakfast with a coke- oh yeah!!"}
{"text":"Lemme tell y'all about somethin' called the \"Kinda Fried Turkey\". It is not at all what it seems. When us southerners hear \"fried\" we think breaded, first of all. But I'm happy to report that it is in fact not breaded. It's simply slices of what I assume to be a deep-fried, Thanksgiving-style turkey. Man that sandwich kills it! I love it. When I came back a second time I couldn't help but get the same thing. They're sweet 'tater fries are also pretty good. They come with a honey mustard sauce which I ended up putting on...well everything.  My friends swear by the crab hushpuppies but I don't care for crab myself so I sat that one out. I got to try a bite or two of the cornbread-battered shrimp. THOSE were GOOD! Again, dipped 'em in that honey mustard. I read that those are what brought Pinky's to TV fame.  Food aside, this place kicks ass inside. Sorry for the profanity kids, but I can think of no better descriptive word that really does it justice. Signs and stickers galore line the walls, doors, frames, appliances...basically anywhere with a surface. Seriously cool looks back into the history of Charlotte. And really, when you take in the location of Pinky's it's a wonder that it has lasted. It's sort of like a beacon in the middle of not-a-whole-lot. Sure there's some stuff that's sprung up around it. It's just hard to put in words but the place feels like it belongs and always has belonged. It's a moniker you only earn over time.  The staff here has been usually very helpful and friendly, especially for a perpetual noob like myself with a billion questions and a penchant for pointless conversation. They have banana pudding on the dessert menu. It's a great way to honor southern cooking and charm in one. And of course an even better way to round out a delicious, and affordable, meal."}
{"text":"Food was great. Had the White Trash Burger, Hush Puppies and Corn Dog Shrimp. Also tried the Squirrelly Temple. I was NOT disappointed. The atmosphere is totally relaxed. Staff was awesome, as was the music. When I go back to NC, I'm definitely coming back to Pinky's!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't thought to write a review on Pinky's until now. Well, this place is hip, clean, and has great food. Went here today and had the hummus appetizer, which was surprisingly indulgent. It has some very tasty hummus, an artichoke salad, black olives (that tasted like green olives), chopped tomato and sliced red onions. This appetizer could easily be a full meal in itself. I ordered my usual falafel wrap, which was awesome as always. In the past, I have also had the vegetarian hot dog, which is also pretty delicious.   Two downsides to this place: the music selection is not to my liking (mostly pop/hip hop) and the parking is so limited, you must park across the street or way in back. For now, we are lucky that many other places nearby are out of business, so we can park in their old lots.   My sister was with me today and asked why I had kept this place a secret. It's no secret, I just don't get enough opportunities to go to Pinky's as much as I would like.  Go to Pinky's. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"There is certainly nothing fancy about this place and I appreciate that. Its exactly the type of place Guy Fieri would hang out-- and in fact, he had. You're going to be served on a paper plate and eating with a plastic fork. The decor is very eclectic.   Went between lunch and dinner on a Saturday afternoon and it was still slammed. We sat at the bar, and I didn't expect them to have such a good drink/beer selection.   Started with the pimpin fries-- a must order. Waffle fries covered in pimento cheese. What more could you ever want in life.   I ordered the Big John Chicken Sandwich and it was very good. Boyfriend got a burger that was almost too huge to eat. We shared a side of the homemade chips. Next time I am definitely getting the Reuben Dog. Really want to try their homemade veggie burger as well!   You really get a lot for the money here. Great spot for when you are looking for something casual or are *cough* hungover *cough*.   Park in the Pinkys spaces at Dunkin Donuts across the street!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed everything I ate,  burger,  wings,  and chips.   All fresh and good quality.   Service was great.    Have some really unique menu items.   High class bar food would be how I'd describe it.  I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Wanting to feel like we were some of the cool kids, we stopped at Pinky's on a Saturday afternoon.  Good choice - they were almost empty, yet you still have to park across the street and it is like a live-action game of Frogger to make it to your food.  I do not even want to imagine what this place is like when they are busy.  Is it too much to ask that places get ample parking rather than having to look for it elsewhere?  Once inside, the surroundings are nice.  For those looking to find the cramped-yet-homey feel of the old Penguin, look elsewhere.  This is more of a redone, upscale garage.  It works.  Even though there were not many customers, the service was on the slow side.  Friendly enough, just not all that motivated if you know what I mean.  When it comes to the food is when things really shine.  In fact, the menu is so awesome that the actual food has trouble keeping up.  That is not to say that the food is bad - just that the descriptions on the menu get your taste buds in overdrive, and the service takes a touch longer than it should, so that by the time the food arrives, it could be perceived as a bit of a let down.  All of the components are good, but they do not fit together just right.  Not yet, anyway.  Give it a try, give them a while to work out the kinks, and over time, I think you will be likely to see some improvement here.  Right now they still have some growing pains."}
{"text":"I used to live in Wesley Village across from Pinky's... Needless to say, I went there quite often when I was craving some greasy food. Their ding dong style anything is amazing -- crunchy peanut butter, sriracha, and cilantro slaw.   They actually have some decent salads too. I like the falafel salad."}
{"text":"My first visit to Pinky's did not disappoint. The food was fantastic; I had the White Trash burger, hush pups, waffle fries, and fried pickles, along with a vanilla Sparkle Pony. Although it was extremely busy, the food came fairly quick, and the staff was super friendly. The inside of the place was super cool and unique, too, and I couldn't help but snap a bunch of photos while I was there. If I lived closer to Charlotte, there's no doubt I would be eating here ALL the time, but until then, I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Words can't express how I love this restaurant! Atmosphere is fun and friendly. Staff is ALWAYS nice. Parking can be tough to find but we always get lucky and happen to find parking in their actual lot. You can also park across the street where Dunkin Donuts is. I have tried their double chili cheeseburger and it was so good and juicy. I got it with a side of potato salad and it was good. I also tried their waffle fries and they were crispy. Tried the wings too and they were delicious. Boyfriend said they were one of the best he's ever had. Ranch dressing is so good with it. My favorite item on the menu is their chili dog with pimento cheese and I add onions to it. The chili is sooo good but the pimento cheese on it really gives the flavor a kick. Food is so good here but their prices are even better."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've been to Pinky's,  despite living within walking distance. The last time wasn't all that great, but we decided to give it another go tonight. This visit was much better. The service was friendly and efficient, the food came super fast, and with one exception everything was good. We both got burgers (a pterodactyl w/ gorganzola and a white trash), she got fried pickles and I got waffle fries. That last item was the only flop; the fries were hot but really, really tough, like they'd been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time. I appreciate that the food came fast but I'd have been willing to wait a couple extra minutes for freshly cooked fries. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"We definitely enjoyed this place.  The service was incredibly fast and reasonably friendly.  The food was good.  Nothing spectacular, but exactly what we were looking for.  I had a basic burger and fries and my wife got the white trash burger w/ the fried pickles on it.  Great sweet tea.  I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a good quick burger fix."}
{"text":"Casual place, friendly staff and great food!  The Big John is a fantastic chicken sandwich, and the sweet potato fries are delicious.  Never had a bad meal, or bad service.  It's my first \"go to\" place for a great casual meal."}
{"text":"Food was okay - greasy, fast foody, heavy. Service was good - always attended to, but by four or five different servers. VERY loud, especially in the outdoor seating area. I have been to the one in South Charlotte, and I find that this one was made to be trendier. I don't know if I would return."}
{"text":"Oh Pinky's so many reviews already I don't really need to say much more than I forking love your Nature Burger and your swanky drink menu. Sit at the bar if you go, I've never had more attentive barkeeps at a restaurant. Super awesome place for the veggies and meatheads."}
{"text":"We have been several times to pinky's and enjoyed the food and service, but today they made my bad list. Came there just after they open on a Sunday at about 11:15. There are maybe 5 people in the whole place, two tables in use on their huge new patio. We like to take our dog with us to places that have outdoor seating so we didn't think it would be an issue. My husband goes inside to ask for an outside table and he is told they don't allow dogs on their patio. This really annoyed me. Like I said large new patio, Sunday morning with only two tables in use, but I'm not allowed to have a member of my family out there when she is a very well behaved dog. Sadly this will greatly affect my desire to return here even to come for lunch or dinner in the future, which is annoying since this is one of the few restaurants on west end."}
{"text":"I urge you NOT to eat here. Somehow the crabpuppies were either prepared incorrectly or cross contaminated, and resulted in an immediate stomachache followed by stomach pain all night, and this went for everyone in our party who had them (those who didn't were fine afterwards).  Service was not the best, and one server we had was very impatient and uncomfortable, making our experience the same.   Overall, food was cheap but not great for the very cheap price, the Matty patty melt was very dry and after a few bites I couldn't force myself to finish it. Absolutely one of the WORST dining experiences I've had in Charlotte, and I hope this was just a bad experience and not a typical one."}
{"text":"Good ambience, good casual food, service is good and just a fun place to eat."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. My first visit wasn't so great only because they were packed and there literally wasn't anywhere to sit for like an hour. But that just meant to me that it needed to be tried again on a slow day so I did just that. Had the buffalo tacos and fried pickles which were both awesome! The staff were cool and down to earth. Tatted up like myself. Lol. My kid also ate all her food so I was happy about that too. I hate their parking situation tho!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at this location. The staff was extremely helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. The food was great as per usual. I think I like the pace of this location as opposed to the Charlotte one. We usually have to wait at least 15-30 minutes. At this location we were sat immediately. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night. There was about a 15 minute wait. The host was great and so was my server. They have great house drinks. I got the pimpin fries and they were excellent. For dinner I got the white trash burger and a side of onion rings. I didn't care for the onion rings because they're the straw type and I prefer the regular kind. My food came fast and I can tell the servers there work as a team to get things done. I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"Wish I wasn't trying to eat healthy that day I went to pinkys, didn't help much since I ordered a popcorn chicken salad but I told myself it's the healthiest thing on the menu. Wah...was.  This place is great! Friendly servers, cool ambience with neat decor, no frills place. My salad was huge in portion, popcorn chicken was crispy, and they added fried onions to the salad. A friend of mine ordered a white trash burger and was satisfied with the meal."}
{"text":"Pinky's is kind of-sort of a local legend in Charlotte.  First of all, how many restaurants have an old school Volkswagon bug on the roof? When I was a kid, the building used to be an auto shop. My brother and I had our little fists ready whenever we drove by (remember \"punch bug, no punch back!\").  Second, Pinky's is kind of the successor to The (original) Penguin. The Penguin is a restaurant located not far away and is famous. No, really. I'm talking Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives famous. The owner of Pinky's was a co-owner of the Penguin and a chef there. The Penguin changed hands in 2010 (not really sure exactly what happened, but loyal patrons of The Penguin were LIVID) and judging by the fact that Pinky's is ALWAYS packed, they all came along with the owner & some of their menu items.  Despite the same ownership, the similarities end there. The Penguin was a hole in the wall burger joint. Pinky's is much more diverse. The menu includes fried pickles, hummus, some fabulous salads, a variety of burgers & hot dogs, tacos, corn dog shrimp (my absolute FAVORITE), and so on. Everything I've had there has been amazing, and this visit did not disappoint.  I strayed from my usual (and absolute favorite corn dog shrimp) and had one of their specials. It was a spicy chicken burrito with Caesar dressing, tomatoes, crisp romaine lettuce & loads of Parmesan cheese. It came with a side of their delicious black beans and tortilla chips. I wasn't in the mood for chips, so I ordered a side of waffle fries as well.  The wrap was delicious, but not as spicy as I would have liked. The chunks of chicken were huge & delicious. The dressing was delicious and the flavors came together well. This thing was HUGE though. I ate half at that moment and ate the other half for dinner and it was still just as good.  Graham had one of the other specials, the flounder plate. He gave me one of his hush puppies, and a bite of his fish. Everything was so good! The fish was perfectly cooked, the hush puppies were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. His portion was just as generous as mine and just as good.  Pinky's is one of the places we stop at every time we make a trip home. The food is always good, and the service is always excellent. I LOVE that I see the exact same faces every time I'm there.   Stop by and try a white trash burger, or a Spaugh burger (named after a nearby middle school) or their famous fried pickles, You absolutely will not regret it."}
{"text":"Just.What.This.Area.Needed.  Yep, Pinky's fills the quick, tasty, cheap food void in the Wesley Heights area with a stacked menu, cool place and really, really great staff. A bunch of yelp peeps dropped by Pinky's for a grand old time and I got to taste a smattering of stuffs. Some of my faves from the menu...  Crab Hush Puppies: ZOMG. If a little crab made love to a hush puppy, this is its delicious baby. But it's also a big puppy. And served with a delicious tartar sauce. Oh, and there are 13 per order for $4.95. If that's not love, I don't know what is.  Pimento Cheese Fries: A heart attack in a basket, and delicious. I don't know if I could (or ever should) eat an entire basket by my lonesome, but these were magnificent.   Pterodactyl burger: A seemingly basic burger, but nicely seasoned and well cooked. Oh, and it's a steal at $4.25.   Veggie Corn Dog: The only reason I tried this is simply because I didn't believe my buds that a veggie corn dog could be delicious. Oh, but it is. Veg heads celebrate!  Fried Pickles: Perfectly fried with the light, crispy breading we all know and love. With the saucy sauce.   Oh I'm a fan of you Pinky's and I'll be back soon..."}
{"text":"What a fun place. Quirky and cute. Really inexpensive. College kids could fill up here  not fine dining but good dogs and burgers. Salads for the healthy eaters"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have been to both locations, but the Huntersville location is 5 mins down the road. The food is amazing (try the pimpin waffle fries w/ with chili), staff is friendly and funny, drinks are good and strong try the Katrina.. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pinkys has the best bar food and the service is the best. I don't know how they make it work, but it is like everyone is synchronized. The food comes out quickly and the servers are great.   Everything I have tried has been delicious. My favorite are the shrimp tacos with the sweet potato fries. Oreo and coconut cakes are the best"}
{"text":"Crazy good food, fresh and well-priced!  The waitstaff must work as a team instead of by sections.  We had the best service and EVERYONE took care of us.  Great experience and funky atmosphere.  This will be on our list of regular spots!"}
{"text":"Pinky's is a fun spot to eat with a group or with your kids. Something on the menu for every eater and good food at that. I love their Buffalo Shrimp Tacos and the White Trash Burger (provolone, fried pickles, onion rings and spicy ranch sauce) is another yummy option. Pinky's has a great menu, fun atmosphere and good servers. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Pinky's lived up to and went beyond the hype! Food was really phenomenal - you must order a burger ding dong style. Service was very speedy and the price can't be beat. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When I moved here a couple of months ago, I was told to try The Penguin. I went and had a horrible experience, and the reason is that many of those people who'd made the Penguin what it was are no longer there, but at this awesome place instead.   As we drove up to street and heard our GPS yelling at us, \"location is on the left!\" we started looking around because we didn't know what to expect. I can honestly tell you, I loved it as soon as I saw it. There is an old VW Beetle parked, on the roof. Naturally, and a concrete Triceratops waiting to greet you as you park.   I gave it cool points as soon as we got parked and I could see all the small little rubber dinosaurs standing on or under Mr.Concrete Dino in the grass. Yeah I'm like a short big kid, so what??? At least I admit it. :P  We walk in to the place and it's broken into two sections. The main section is a bunch of booths and the bar, and the other side is like a tiki room of sorts with a large garage door that opens to the outside. I bet that's awesome on a nice cool day. I ordered the Herb Roasted Turkey sandwich, and I cannot remember the real name of it now dangit!! But OMG was it DELICIOUS!!!  Our waitress was very prompt, and the staff were all running around helping each other out. The food came out in no time flat, and when they brought it over my eyes had to be the size of saucers. That turkey sandwich was GIGANTIC!!! Maybe that's why the dinosaur is outside. It represents the size of the portions?   When I took that first bite I was in L-O-V-E. So, now I can't even say I like Pinky's. I have to say LOVE because anything less would be lying. I also got a Shirley Temple...short big kid, I told ya... and it too was amazing. They put a spin on it, and make it look all pretty. It's got the standard sprite and grenadine but they add in pineapple juice! YUMMO!!!  My only complaint is the parking. We got lucky and were able to grab a spot in the lot, but if we weren't that fortunate I think there is extra parking across the street? I want to go back again very soon. Or right now.. I could probably run out of work unnoticed temporarily to go there.... hmmmm....  ;P"}
{"text":"Just wanted to follow-up here. Still one of my favorite places...the husband, kiddo and I usually hit it up sometime on Sunday (we call it \"the Holy Church of Pinky's\", since we usually make it here instead of church - ha!).   We've had some rough experiences lately though...bringing a toddler out anywhere is super stressful at times and the wait staff can make or break it. The wait staff has been in transition lately and we had stopped going in lieu of a chain restaurant with an extensive kids menu and wait staff that liked our kid.   When the little man first started eating solid foods, the wait staff gave their recommendations on how to order stuff to get the best deal on a smaller portion, because he's two and two year old's just don't eat all that much.  But, then, that staff left and the newbies didn't know what we were talking about when we asked for a \"side of fried chicken\" or a \"kids burger\". They'd let us wait just a little too long for food/drinks, or not bring little man's food in a timely manner (gotta expedite the kids meals), plus weren't friendly...it was too much and we stopped going.  Decided to give our favorite place another try this last week and had a GREAT experience. Still got our least favorite waitress, but she has really picked up the pace and gave us a much, much better level of service than we had come to expect from her.  The service makes such a big difference.  Looking forward to an even better experience next week!"}
{"text":"Service was phenomenal food was excellent. Need I say more... but I will! I'm a manager at a popular busy restaurant, been in the industry for 27 years I loved it! Well done guys."}
{"text":"We stopped by in our way to up town charolette and the pictures on yelp don't do it justice... it's a really nice place. So much to see in the restaurant! Forest art work and friendly staff. The spicy garlic tuna salad was on point!!! So good! The fish tacos were oK, my friend had a tummy ache afterwards tho :/."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and great food. The.pickles and sweet potato chips are out of this world and the buffalo shrimp tacos are awesome!! Will def return! !"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!  I got the white trash burger (provolone cheese, fried pickles, onion rings, ranch dressing) and it was SO good!  My boyfriend got the mammoth burger and loved it too.  Fried pickles and crab puppies appetizers were tasty as were accompanying sauces.  Cool place with lots of different options and a big mixed drink menu too.  Guy Fieri praised it on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives, and now we know why.   We will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place more than the new Penguin.  New to area so never went to the old Penguin.  Maybe they are still working on the bumps and hiccups but one time everything was undercooked or wrong and the next time everything fried was WAY overdone.  It was like pickle jerky.    The redeamer is the Crab Hush Puppies.  Both times these are the belle of the ball.  May do these and a beer next time.  Will go again but may be a while."}
{"text":"Very good...everything. Including friendly service that did not rush us through. Terrific burger, lived up to the billing. Nicely done."}
{"text":"I am disappointed to write this review bc I've eaten here before and the food was really good, but tonight they were racist. I asked for a table and they told me to wait which was fine, but a couple walked in after me and they were sat immediately, I overlooked that but it happened again so I walked out."}
{"text":"Great local spot. I get the white trash burger every single time...love it. Guys fiery been here and you call tell why. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"You do have to dig deep and find local institutions to dine at while visiting another city. Stay away from those chains!  Pinky's was recommended to us by a nice guy who was working at the Manifest Records. So, yes, listen to the locals. Then, while looking through the local paper, Pinky's made the top 5 for best dinners in Charlotte! And yes, it made more than an appearance in Guy Fieri's \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\".   So, we kept the best for the last and stopped at Pinky's on the way to the airport, hoping for the best. The outside decor, a cute VW bug on top of the building didn't disappoint. Same with the cool, funky decor. If you're into music, movies, comics, this place is a little paradise decor wise. You'll keep looking around while listening to their fun tunes they're playing. Not a boring minute in there.  As you can imagine, this joint doesn't specialize in health food, although they have decent salads, wraps, a few Middle-Eastern dishes. Otherwise it's American diner food, with a Southern influence, pushed to it its limits.  We started with a basked of fried pickles, my first ever, and they were good. Greasy with goodness.  My husband tried their Korean Pork BBQ tacos and they were very tasty, with a nice slaw, the Tahini Salad was decent, fresh,  so was the White Trash burger (reading the menu in this place was a hoot).We got waffle fries for the table.   I saw their burger of the month while checking their menu on line (in November they had a Greek burger), the photo made me drool and that's all I kept thinking about. We went there in December, during the X-mas holidays, so the burger of the month was different, but the Greek one turned into a personal obsession for me (I love burgers and Greek food, so this was a perfect heavenly combination in my book). I usually don't go divaesque on anyone, but since the servers were super nice, I asked about the Greek burger and they offered to ask the chef to make one for me, with pita bread instead of buns and they did, and they made this girl super happy. The Greek burger didn't disappoint, it came with fresh tomatoes, feta cheese, Kalamata olives. Opa! Thanks for indulging me! It melted in my mouth, full of goodness.  What else can you drink with this type of food? We got a pitcher of local beer (the pitcher was our server's idea, it made it for a better deal, $15), tried the Lenny Boy de la Witt, a bit amber, I wish it was a bit stronger, but decent overall.  And no, we didn't stop here. We went big, so we ordered the desserts, the biggest banana pudding we've ever seen and the Cheerwine pound cake, nice, moist and fun.  Decent prices, good service, free parking to the right, once you pass the restaurant, cool, funky decor.  Once again, you don't go to Pinky's for health food, you indulge, dive in, experience a cool, fun, local institution."}
{"text":"The quality of food was as advertised.  I was extremely impressed with the alcoholic drinks.   They were surprising good. I will return again when I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm recently vegan... and this burger place is very vegetarian friendly and vegan if you make a few changes. The Nature Boy is a black bean sweet potato burger that's vegan. I got it on a whole wheat bun (all their buns are vegan), with roasted red peppers, artichokes and their white bean hummus (which is very good). It was great! The burger is deep fried and fell apart easily but tasted great. This is a one fryer type of joint so it's not really vegan.... :("}
{"text":"Why did I eat here again?? Epic fail. The owners didn't do very good in Huntersville trying to replicate the uptown Charlotte Pinkys.. Officially my last chance at trying them. Food is just cold, not done.. Unless you get Pimento cheese fries- they WILL be burnt. Never had a problem at the uptown location."}
{"text":"Usually have a solid experience here and the food is typically great, but I do have to say that today I had a really bad encounter with our server. They served us stale fries, I told them about it, and they charged us for a second order. Did not offer to just bring a fresh basket out."}
{"text":"Pinkys is an all around great place if you dont care about your health. Pimento cheese waffle fries topped with fresh hot bacon. Say no more fam. Recommend the white trash burger, but if you're looking out for your figure the Turkey burger is also a fantastic choice. Groovy vibe. Check it out."}
{"text":"Date: 04/30/2017 Time: 6:30 PM  I freakin' love this place! We were brought here by my Aunt and Uncle from Charlotte and I am so so glad!!! It was divine!!!!   We were greeted with such friendliness, the hostess that was working was GREAT! She graciously made sure we sat where we were comfortable with a big smile on her face! The environment was very laid back and there was PLENTY of parking in front of the restaurant.   The food was incredible! I ordered a Patsy melt (their version of a patty melt with thousand island on it) and housemade chips with delicious homemade ranch. Everyone in my party loved their meals!!! I didn't have any because I don't like food that crawls out of the ocean (or swims in it), but everyone else said the crab puppies were great!   The food is very modestly priced. I got out of there with what I ordered and a drink for about ten bucks plus tip.   I definitely recommend stopping in! They have tons of great vegetarian options, too!!!"}
{"text":"Great food for a great price! Love how they have multiple waiters and share the tips. Very relaxed setting."}
{"text":"Experts in their craft! You don't have to be white trash to enjoy the white trash burger and a PBR or Natty Boh... I eat here way too much and it's actually not enough!"}
{"text":"Where else on this green earth else can you find delicious waffle fries, King of all other varieties of fries? I don't eat at Chick-Fil-A anymore and have missed waffle fries for so long.  But it's not just all fries folks, the vegan options are also bar none. I get either the Nature Boy or the One and Only and am never disappointed. It's not one of those crispy veggie burgers though, so be ready for a bit of delicious mushiness.  Atmosphere is always a weird hodgepodge of pop culture and rockabilly. I generally dig the tunes they play.  If you're going to the huntersville location bring a jacket, they keep this place on ice."}
{"text":"Great dive bar feel with exceptional food. Good beer selection and great burgers and hot dogs."}
{"text":"The Triple G Burger was to die for! The crab puppies were my favorite app, and the banana pudding was the best banana pudding I've had in a long long time. The service and atmosphere were really nice too. Pinky's is a must go-to spot when your in Charlotte. Straight"}
{"text":"I came by myself and got seated in 15-20 minutes. My server was sweet and I ordered the sweet potato fries with honey mustard first. The fries were average, but the honey mustard was amazing! It is apparently house made, so I highly recommend getting it with whatever you order.   She didn't come back to see what else I wanted, but someone else did. I ordered the chicken tacos and waited for about 30-45 minutes. The second server  checked on me several times, so she was very attentive and I appreciated that. When the food finally came, she said she would give me a 50% employee discount due to the wait and I was thrilled! I wasn't in a rush to be anywhere so I didn't mind the wait and didn't ask for a discount, but this was really wonderful customer service! (Especially because my most recent dining experience was the complete opposite.. see my review for hillside farmacy in Austin tx if you're curious).   Overall, this is a pretty solid 4/5 star review because the food wasn't extraordinary, but the customer service made up for it. I wouldn't mind coming back if I'm in town to try something else."}
{"text":"Pinky's is a great, family friendly restaurant with cheap food that is unique and delicious. The burgers are the stars of the show here, especially the Ding Dong Burger which is a 5oz patty topped with peanut butter, sriracha and honey cilantro slaw. They quite possibly could have the best fried pickles in the Queen City. The atmosphere is eclectic and fun and the service was fast.  Definitely a must for any Foodie visiting Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Solid! My son J and I ate here for lunch today, after sending my wife to NY for a business trip.   As we walked in, I noticed this place has the ambience of a great American burger bar, with a Frankenstein poster on one wall, some Nascar remnants and a top of a beer making vat on the wall, and JBL speakers blasting some fine music at just the right level. A couple of muted monitors over the bar ran ESPN2 and some sports equipment infomercials.  Sitting down, we noticed the menu is varied enough to satisfy anyone. The beer list is great, the mixed drink list is intriguing, and I'd love to come here with a group of adults in search of a good time.   The smiling, artfully tattooed and nose-ringed waitress brought me a fresh cup of really fine coffee. My son had a Dr. Brown's Root Beer.   We shared a small order of fried dill pickles before our sandwiches arrived. They were piping hot, lightly breaded, and served with a cool ranch dip. I ate so many I had a stomach ache later. They were better than I remembered them from the old Penguin.  I had the Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich, a Thai-inspired concoction of grilled chicken, peanuts, lettuce, tomato, mayo, Sriracha, and other goodies on a sandwich bun. It was hot, tasty, and satisfying.   J. had a Kinda Fried Turkey Sandwich. He was stuffed and happy, having washed it down with his root beer.  The restaurant is a remodeled service station that was obviously around for a long, long, time, but it has been tastefully rebuilt, attractively furnished, and turned into a really cool, if small bar/restaurant. It was packed at noon this Sunday, with a mix of tattooed biker types, preppies, fashionable couples, and family types like us.   We'll be back with the rest of the family to sample other things on the menu. I noticed enough vegetarian-friendly food on the menu to satisfy my daughter, a very picky eater with high expectations."}
{"text":"i like pinkys, i sit down and order food and it gets to me. eventually. well, sort of. one time i ordered a grilled cheese and soup and they brought me a turkey burger. im extremely patient so for some people this might be a deal breaker, but it was okay. then it took a while for me to get that grilled cheese sandwich. in fact, it seemed like it was really hard for them to understand that on that day, with my tomato soup, i wanted a grilled cheese sandwich.   in the end they only charged me for the soup and my glass of water. i never asked them to do that, so it was pretty surprising to see it on my bill.   other than that, pinkys is alright. you get some food and you eat it and if you're there with a few people just make sure to have a lot of conversation topics because you'll be there for a while. seriously."}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte for the ACC Championship game, and my husband who does business a good bit in Charlotte, insisted on taking our group to Pinky's.  First off, the decor, the people, everything is just FUN!  The second we walked in and saw the artwork, the pinball machine, and the music blasting, I realized this was going to be awesome.  The burgers and hotdogs were very good, although smaller than what most people are probably used to.  The Fries with pimento cheese on them were a big hit with our table.     I had the white trash burger and the sweet potato fries, both were delish, although the fries could be split, they were large for a side.   Everyone at our table enjoyed their burgers and dogs.  I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for years and they never skip a beat. Took my boyfriend here to get a sense of the southern punk/hipster scenery in Charlotte. The staff is all very upbeat and friendly! Which is one of my favorite things about this place. I got the chicken philly and it was so so delicious! My boyfriend got the tuna melt and it was TO DIE FOR! their menu is big enough and elaborate as to what each menu item is for those who wouldn't know."}
{"text":"I wasn't crazy about Pinky's north. Liked the idea maybe it was an off day. Got kind of sick off greasy food. Maybe I'll try the one on Morehead."}
{"text":"This food is delicious, the atmosphere is. Awesome, both have their own personality and are so unique I highly recommend going there"}
{"text":"Came her after kickball - I understand it's a busy time because they sponsor our league and the servers are all very nice - but I'm not overly impressed with the menu, everything is fried and isn't very appetizing while reading the menu. Not sure I'd come back if it wasn't for kickball."}
{"text":"This is a good little spot to come to after kickball games, not my usual type of restaurant but definitely fun to come to with a group, I believe they have corn hole too."}
{"text":"Deliciousness. Super fresh food in a eclectic, divey indoor/outdoor joint. Parking is awful, especially during peak lunch or dinner hours. The service is great, but the food is even better. A must see when you are around the area."}
{"text":"Housed in what was formerly an auto repair shop, Pinky's Westside Grill is a heck of a great find. Not a dive by any means, but a funky diner with a light hearted way of serving up some seriously delicious food.  I had the burger w/pimento cheese which was outstanding!!! I am eager to try some of the other offerings, notably their corn dog and bologna sandwich. Service was exceptional!!! Attentive, friendly and helpful.  Charlotte is just a LONG way from Sweet Home Alabama..."}
{"text":"I like this place. Met some friends after work for drinks.  The staff was very attentive, the drinks were inexpensive. We didn't eat but everything I saw looked great so I'll be back. I rated four stars based on this experience alone.  It was Monday, and they were out of lots of beers and some drink making products. I guess it's better to run out than hold inventory? (I'm sure there are theories to support either strategy) As I hadn't been there before, I assumed the dirt lot with no signage behind the building was fair fame for parking but was a little concerned about being towed.  A sign reading it's okay to park there would be welcome to newcomers.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"What a gem!! Don't let the rough exterior fool you, this place serves top-notch food. Must get the corn dog shrimp and the crab puppies. Refills on drinks occurred quickly and always with a smile. A real surprise?? The cole-slaw!! It was fresh, crispy, and lightly dressed. So often you get cole-slaw that is heavy on the dressing and overly wet. This was yummy! One tip -- parking is slightly down the street, so don't bother trying to park in the teeny tiny lot in front of the location."}
{"text":"My daughter decided to have a  birthday celebration dinner here with her friends and what a great idea. Great atmosphere, food, and excellent service provided by Brianna and Tony, and generally anyone who stopped by to ask if we needed anything.  No clean up for me.. thank u very much!"}
{"text":"It was ok shrimp tacos just not as good as I had hoped but all is well took family Edith had quesadilla it was again just ok kids had burger probably need to step up their game to get us back seems a very long wait for food!"}
{"text":"Passing thru town and found this gem. Turns out Guy Ferri did a dives and drives here. I got the corndog shrimp. Absoutely delish. Corn bread coating around the shrimp. Nice a think. Great flavor. Eat every bite. I would go back with out a doubt. I also got a side of potato salad. TOOO die for. Yummy. Red potato, mustard base, creamy. Loved."}
{"text":"Recently, I did the unthinkable... I gave up meat, seafood and dairy.  Well, mostly.  As a someone who is new to plant-based living, I still struggle at a lot of restaurants.  I do tend to cheat every now and then when I go out with buddies.  Having been to Pinky's before and loved the burgers that I had, I was a little bummed to go back today... expecting their only vegan option to be a pretty bland salad.  I quickly noted very many vegetarian options and thought that I would have to settle for the vegetarian burger until I saw a note that said \"ask server about vegan options.\"  I was impressed to hear that they provide Beyond Burgers on any of their dishes and they recently began providing a vegan pimento cheese.  I was stoked that #1 the waitress took the time to explain the options and #2 that I could enjoy more of the fun meals I enjoyed without having to make too many exceptions.  Even though I prefer to avoid fake meats since they don't usually taste good and the idea behind going plant-based is to avoid most processed foods... this burger was delish.  I ended up with the White Trash Burger without cheese or mayo and added the vegan pimento.  I was in heaven.  I don't really care if a patty tastes like \"the real thing\" or not because I don't think vegetables should be expected to taste like meat.  BUT... for those who do care, the Beyond Burger patty is the closest thing to meat that I have eaten in plant-based burger form. Texture. Flavor. Color. Amen.  And the pimento cheese was just an added bonus thrown on top of this delicious burger.  I can't fault any restaurant for not having too many vegan options.  After all, this was my personal choice and vegan supplies are ex-pen-sive.  However, it was a great treat to go out to lunch with buds and indulge this afternoon."}
{"text":"Chill spot! Everyone was relaxed and not caught up in corporate bullshit!! Best burger I have had since moving here from California and MY GOD THE RED POTATO SALAD IS A GOFT FROM GOD!! And my bill was only $11! GOD BLESS PINKYS AND NO PLACE ELSE!"}
{"text":"Very good food for the price and friendly staff this place gets better every time I stop bye to grab a bite."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday had a double cheese burger it was fresh and juicy. Banana putting off the chain.And nice looking girls work there."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food!!!! I love the Pinky Dog! Comes with homemade pimento cheese and homemade chili! Phenomenal doesn't even cut it! The cheese fries are outstanding, and my boyfriend loves the Triple G! And as always the staff is very helpful and on top of things! I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Would LOVE to write a review on the food but I cannot.  Why?  Well, after parking in a very muddy, rut-filled gravel/mud parking lot, we walked in and stood at the hostess stand...  After five minutes of being ignored, seeing the hostess walk by us three times, ignoring us to help others, we left!   Pinky's - you've gotten too big for your britches.  Sheesh.  You lost out on some really hungry folks - oh well.   And to the people who we heard were waiting an hour to eat at Pinky's...wow.  There are other places to eat, folks."}
{"text":"I got a pimento cheeseburger with bacon chili and grilled onions. It was hands down the best pimento cheese I've ever had and I wish I had the appetite to have gotten cheese fries too. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"This place was fun. I ordered a sandwich called the Green Chile Pork and it was interestingly good. Felt like a luau on a bun - despite the classic DDD setting rock n roll themed decor. It was packed and people seemed to also be having a blast. Since it was a DDD location - in typical fashion - I ordered the fried pickles, of which Guy had on the show. Another interesting item was the corn dog battered shrimp. I think anything battered like a corn dog can get a thumbs-up."}
{"text":"For a burger joint we love this place.  The service is great.  You have multiple wait staff checking on you.  The pimento cheese waffle fries are a must have if you are into that.  The white trash burger is my favorite.  We get chicken wings as take out at least 2 times a month.  We have been going here for over 8 years.  If we have friends from out of town we more often then not end up here.  Price is super reasonable and will shock you.  Leave room for the banana pudding!"}
{"text":"Pinky's Westside Grill is a great addition to Huntersville. With their quirky interior design, unique cocktails, and deliciously fun \"bar food\" menu it is a welcome relief from all the sameness of other eateries in Huntersville.  The staff here is mega friendly and enjoy working as a team to make sure no customer need goes unmet. The menu has something for everyone in the family, and the fact that it doesn't have an obligatory \"Kids Menu\", allowed the youngsters in our party to choose from \"The Big People's\" menu and they loved it.  Pinky's should be on everyone's go to list for an eclectic and fun dining experience!"}
{"text":"First time.visitor to this location.  I used to frequent this area of Charlotte on a daily basis as part of my job.32 years ago this lot was actually a parking lot  shared with a car body shop. This was a quick seating at 5:30 on a Saturday afternoon.  The wait service was attentive and timely. The food came out really quickly and was very good.  The fare is mostly burgers and crafted sandwiches.All good and I ll definitely return."}
{"text":"Not only is Pinky's located on a hilariously named street, it is serving up fantastic burgers.  It may not be the healthiest place, but it is definitely the heartiest.  They've discovered a critical secret of burgers/food - pimento cheese makes things better.  I ordered the Pterodactyl topped with pimento cheese and was pleasantly surprised with how tasty it was.  The size is big but not massive, perfect for not feeling like a worthless sloth afterwards.  I paired it with waffle fries which were perfect for collecting up pimento cheese that had squirted out of the burger.  As far as burgers go in the area, it's difficult to beat out Pinky's Westside.    The location is in an airy space with quirky decorations, but more importantly, they had a great beer list of craft brews.  So now, you're pairing great burgers with high ABV craft beers?  That's a recipe for success if you ask me.  I'm eager to return to sample the \"Weiner Wonderland\" menu of unique hot dogs, as well as gorge myself on a burger ding dong style (because like pimento cheese and bacon, sriracha makes everything better)."}
{"text":"Friday night and this place is busy. Parking is in a small lot but if that's full you can park across the street or down the block behind this old auto shop bldg. No better time to visit this great diner. I brought friends who had never been to Pinky's before. I don't think they had even heard of it even thought they have lived in the area for 15 years.  We ordered the sweet potato chips with wasabi dip, pimpin' cheese fries with chili and fried pickles. Light and delicious breading on the pickles was so nicely seasoned and the crispy of the sweet potato chips was not greasy at all. Sweet tea was delicious.  Then on to our dinner. We ordered pterodactyl burgers, one DING DONG STYLE and the other WESTSIDE STYLE. cooked to perfection made of ultra fresh beef. Toppings were amazing and in the right proportions to the huge burgers. My other dinner companion ordered the pork burger with arugula and pineapples. It had the most amazing flavor explosion on my tongue when I begged a bite.  We were too full for dessert but took home a piece of pound cake lemon drop style. (Yes like the soda.) They also have cheerwine flavored cake. Just like homemade.  As you can see I really don't like this place!  Totally kidding. I adore it and I'll be back.  As for the staff, they work together like a clock. Everyone there is wiling to fill your glass or answer you needs from the hostess to the cook. That's what makes this place the total package."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, fast service.  Only issue is every waiter takes care every table so topping can be confusing."}
{"text":"Such a fun place! Converted gas station, eclectic decor, great outdoor seating too. Serve beer, burgers and a funky menu with lots of innovative add-on's.   I'm gluten-free and the bun they served was fresh and home baked. I also had the potato salad which was plentiful but a little on the peppery side for my taste.   My husband had the triple cheese burger with grilled onions and it was delish. We both also had the unlimited ice-tea.   Very casual dress and parking in the front is limited so use the huge empty lot right on the side."}
{"text":"I'll make it short and sweet: if you don't like Pinky's you don't like food. It's a great burger bar with tons of passionate creations that will satisfy all your weird and wild cravings that you didn't know you had. Have to try it!"}
{"text":"Just as good as the Charlotte counterpart, if not better! The parking is definitely better here and the restaurant is more spacious. Same great food and wait staff though!!! The cilantro honey coleslaw is to die for!! I usually get the Westside Randy but all of the vegetarian options are amazing!! This restaurant is definitely worth the drive! You never have to wait long to be seated or served. The food is so inexpensive for the quality and quantity you get. I wouldn't dare say cheap because it is far from that!!! Only quality, fresh ingredients are used! I LOVE PINKYS!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Charlotte!!! Not only do I love the fact that everything comes on disposable plates with disposable silverware, but the vegetarian options are sooo delicious!!! I love the Westside Randy :) The wait staff share all the tables which makes for good service....no matter what! The cilantro honey coleslaw is a must!! They have awesome drink specials and the prices are very inexpensive for the great quality of food. If you haven't been, you are missing out!!"}
{"text":"Oh, the joy of fried food!  Pinky's delivers taste in a big way in a cool and funky package.  We decided to try them one Saturday evening.  About parking...don't even try to park in the small lot in front of the restaurant.  Head across the street to the larger lot available for Pinky's customers.   The decor in this place is funky and cool.  Similar to Bad Daddy's, Pinky's plays awesome music and has neat stuff all over the walls.  Even at only 6pm, this place was in full swing.  We (luckily) got a small booth near the bar and proceeded to salivate over the menu, trying to pick the best options.  Since we had heard so many good things about the crab pups, it was no question we had to try them as our appetizer.  For our entrees, my hubby got the mammoth burger - basically a double cheeseburger - with waffle fries on the side.  I got the pinky dog, topped with melty pimento cheese and chili, and homemade chips on the side.  As everyone else has stated, the pups are the BOMB.  Crispy on the outside, with a soft, crabby puppy center.  I'm not usually a fan of tartar sauce, but theirs is worth a try.  While we were initially disappointed they only cook burgers well done, my hubby's burger was pretty darned good.  Juicy, plenty of cheese, and just the right amount of toppings.  Yum!  The waffle fries could have been cooked a tad longer for added crispiness, and they needed a little salt.  My hot dog packed a punch.  It was so tasty!  And I honestly think their dogs are better than Bad Daddy's, even though they are smaller.  The homemade chips were good, but I would have liked them a little crispier, too.  The ranch dip they serve with them is divine though!  Service was really quick, even though they were slammed.  I liked that multiple servers assisted with our table, like they all pitch in to help each other filling drinks, clearing empty plates, etc.    Their prices are really reasonable, too.  We can afford to come back often!  In a nutshell, there's a lot to love about Pinky's, and we will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Pinky's Westside Grill opened a little over a year ago just outside of Uptown Charlotte.  This is a fun and casual bar and grill that occupies the former space of a Volkswagen garage on the corner of Freedom and Morehead.  The old \"Triple 'G' Automotive\" sign remains outside and the owners left an old school VW Beetle on the roof of the building.  The Beetle has been painted over with a design of the American flag.  Pinky's serves bar food (hamburgers, hot dogs, salads, sandwiches, etc.) with a creative flair.  For example, you can order a burger \"Ding Dong Style\" with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw, and spicy Sriracha sauce.  They've also got \"Crab Puppies\" (like hush puppies, except made out of crab) and a falafel wrap, so there's some variety.  Prices are very reasonable here with most entrees under $8 each.  I tried one of Pinky's most popular burgers, the White Trash Burger ($4.50).  It comes with a 5 oz. patty topped with provolone cheese, fried pickles, onion rings, and spicy ranch.  While the burger is not ginormous, it is pretty satisfying.  I noticed the server didn't ask me how I'd like my burger cooked, just like my experience at Kickstand earlier this year.  I guess it's a Charlotte thing.  Regardless, the beef is good.  The bun is flat and small.  The waffle fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries are Pinky's most popular sides.  I tried an order of their onion rings plus an order of their honey-cilantro slaw.  The rings and slaw are served in BBQ take-out-style paper trays.  The onion rings are long and stringy.  The batter is a little inconsistent throughout (both crisp and soggy).  When you get to the end of the tray, it's mostly large crumbs of batter.  The honey-cilantro slaw is very good.  While there isn't as much cilantro as I like (I *love* cilantro), the slaw is fresh and crisp.  The lettuce, onion, etc. are cut shredded into several long strands and the honey-mayo (or whatever sauce they use) is applied in just the right amount so the side isn't too strong.  I'd like to try this with a hot dog next time.  While I haven't had them, my friends really like the crab puppies, falafel wrap, and \"Stray Dog\" (vegetarian hot dog), so those are other dishes that have a seal of approval.  Inside the restaurant, many tall windows give you a nice view of the Uptown skyline.  The decor is an entertaining mishmash of all sorts of things including a Ms. Pac-Man arcade cabinet.  The servers are cool, the food comes out fast, and service is great.  When the check comes, they have no problems separating the bill between couples and singles.  There is limited parking available in front of the restaurant.  Your best bet is to park in the free lot across Morehead St."}
{"text":"Usually, I would give the restaurant 4 or 5 stars for great food and atmosphere. However, while attempting to get a seat today, the 5 of us waited for over an hour after being told it would be a short wait. Forty-five minutes into the wait we settled for a shaded outdoor table, but once the sixty minute mark hit we decided to leave, especially since several others had been seated before us."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Will go over from Charlotte just for this place. Andy, one of the owners, was a great guy. Made sure I had gotten my beer multuple times and everyone made sure no one in out group was doing okay. My wife and friends liked the place as well.  Oh, how's the food? I'd be conolaining first thing here if it were bad. Just go over!"}
{"text":"ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESTAURANTS IN CLT!   So many vegetarian options, price is on point, and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Location: great spot in Huntersville but the parking lot is so small for the number of restaurants in the center. Walking in there is an arcade foyer which distracts the kids. Botha and tables abound, very casual.  The food was really good bar food. Wife enjoyed the Pinky Dog, the pimento cheese was delicious according to my southern belle. I had popcorn chicken and their waffle fries are really good.   Banana Pudding: INCREDIBLE, and huge, bring friends.  We would only remove a star of sub par service, not bad, just not attentive."}
{"text":"Such a funky place with very affordable food! I got the pterodactyl burger (all the fixings) with fries and I was really impressed with how quickly we got our food and that it tasted so good! Their menu is pretty big which is surprising so I will definitely be back to try more! They also have a surprising amount of cocktails so seems to be a fun place to go with friends on a Friday night but be prepared to wait!   Also, the sweet tea was so good I felt my blood sugar rising when I took my first sip which is just how I like it!"}

{"text":"A friend and I met at Pinky's for lunch. It was a Thursday and the special was the Philly Cheese Steak. I must admit that it will become a Thursday must! It was tender and so delicious! We shared a order of waffle fries and I'm glad we did. I took half my sandwich home and ate it for lunch the best day and I had a happy mouth! I like the teamwork and loved they suggested the Philly."}
{"text":"A favorite ... Coming here always feels like home. Real comfort food and amazing hospitality. The very first time we walked in we felt welcomed.  Try the crab puppies .. Regular hushpuppies will never be good enough again."}
{"text":"As a lifelong resident of the Queen City, all 53 years spent proudly on the West side, I am glad to see that there is some measure of revitalization along, at least, parts of Freedom Drive. I was very happy when Pinky's moved in. Previous rave reviews by others aside, I am not totally wowed by this restaurant. They do some things right, and to be fair, I have not tried everything on the menu. My wife and I started with the crab puppies. They were pretty good. I am an avowed hush puppy lover and these were good. Think the inside breading part of those cheap deviled crabs rolled into a ball and deep fried. The dipping sauce was good too with a slightly spicy, old bay kind of hint to it. The waffle fries were not great. I felt like they had been sitting around for a little while. They were warm, but not piping hot, and a little tough, but not greasy in the least but not crispy either. The regular burger, westside style ( Mustard, chili, slaw, & onions) was OK. the toppings and the bun were great but the patty just so-so. a tad dry without a lot of flavor, nobody comes here to lose weight, so maybe more fat in the mix would up the flavor quotient. . I know that the Great state of NC handicaps restaurants by dictating that they cook burgers well done, so I will not put all the blame on Pinky. My wife had the same criticism for the white trash burger. toppings were slightly better than the patty and the spicy sauce was the only thing that gave it any interest, the rest was just flavorless texture. The one brightly shining star from this visit was the Viking Corn Dog. Even a Harding Ram like myself can't help loving this masterpiece. Piping hot. crisp and golden brown, the dog was high quality and salty and savory, while the coating was slightly sweet, and the perfect thickness to compliment the dog. We loved the atmosphere, service was very good,  and parking was not a problem, but we were there at 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon during the Panther's game, I understand they can get pretty crowded at other times. Keep up the good work on the things you do right. If you could give half stars, Pinky's would get 2 1/2 from me"}
{"text":"Delicious little dive right outside of Uptown Charlotte! Their crab cake hush puppies are to die for and the sauces are phenomenal too. I had their korean bbq tacos and was not disappointed in the slightest! They were perfectly seasoned and I really enjoyed them. We also ordered a burger with pimento cheese and the cheese was melting off of the bun. It was so good. I had never been here and was extremely happy with the food, service and the unique atmosphere! They have a huge patio as well and I am really looking forward to going out there and enjoying the food and beautiful charlotte weather once it cools down!"}
{"text":"Love Pinkys! Glad there's one up here but it's not the same as the original one. Get the white trash burger!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. There is so much spunk at this location- down to earth, quirky decor, and the best music. Pretty sure they have 100 Pandora stations on shuffle.  Now the most important part: the food. Their burgers are amazing. After all, this is a burger joint. Greasy food. All delicious.  I haven't ordered anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun and the food is great.  The quality is good for the price, but it's the selection that is pretty amazing.  There are so many cool options for sides and mixing things up...it's a laid back, eclectic vibe that is easy to enjoy.  We will be back, the kids loved it!"}
{"text":"The Reuben Dog, the Crab hush puppies and the burgers are great! I like this location better than the original simply because the parking is better. It's family friendly too."}
{"text":"Definitely a must when in Charlotte. This place has great atmosphere and the food is even better. My favorite is the Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich which is a grilled chicken breast topped with crunchy peanut butter, slaw, and siracha. If that's too weird for your pallet then try the White Trash burger or Falafel."}
{"text":"My wife's idea to check this place out today after she saw it on an episode of Diner's, Drive-ins, and Dives and she had been there before during work but not in a long time.  The food was really good pub grub style food but the main reason for the 5 stars is the service, it was outstanding!  Wasn't just one server, it was like everyone who worked in the restaurant worked together, if someone came by and saw your drink low they got you a refill.  If they saw and empty food tray they took it.  I think we had at least 4 different people work our table at one time or another.  Also highly recommend the Pimp'N Fries appetizer."}
{"text":"I loved it!! The atmosphere was relaxed and chill. The food was sooo good and filling for cheap prices! Got the white trash burger and the fried squash! The waiters and waitresses were friendly, make great suggestions and were on top of it!"}
{"text":"I got a quick carry-out for lunch.  I think I saw they had one lunch special on the board.  I think it would be a great idea to have SEVERAL lunch options during certain times.  Wouldn't that be lovely?  I for one would enjoy it.  I am rarely up this way for work, but when I come, I'd be much more likely to come if they had some options...with maybe a side and/or drink?  I don't know, just my opinion.    The girl who took my order was nice and it came out in less than 10 minutes.  I got the veggie burger, white trash style.  It was good, a little sloppy, but ok.  There was no silverware included in my bag, and my job does not offer it, so I couldn't cut my burger.  Overall and ok experience.  I just think that a lot more people would go tot places that offer lunch options."}
{"text":"This place always makes me happy.  The decor and environment is great, fun and welcoming.  The service is always good.  I like the white trash burger, one of my favorites! The food is inexpensive and the drink special are inexpensive also. Everything always tastes terrific!!"}
{"text":"Nice choice for a diner style burger joint. Not the healthiest however fits the mold of comfort food. Always good drinks and they have a heavy pour."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. My burger was really good and the fries were great. It's very small, but I'll say it's a cool place to take visitors. If it wasn't so small I'd probably go there more often, but for that reason I keep my distance lol."}
{"text":"Family consensus: Lives up to the hype. The atmosphere is so fun! All of the staff was amazing and the food!! So good. I had the Tuna ginger salad, kiddo had the corn dog shrimp hubs got the pterodactyl burger with provolone. He wishes the bun had been as amazing as the rest of the burger but it wasn't bad--fried pickles I had never had before but we all loved them. hush puppies for a win because the dipping sauces are fantastic. (kiddo loves the kick in the BBQ sauce) e"}
{"text":"I can't get the pimento cheese chili fries out of my head.   Seriously, and I ate lunch an hour ago. They're floating around my food brain, winking and smiling at me. Come get us, they're saying. Quick, before we get soggy.  So, what is it that makes the place so good? Consistency. It isn't the quality of food - which at Pinky's is obviously artery-clogging. It isn't anything cutting edge or challenging, introducing you to new, wondrous flava combos. It's the fact that every time, every time I order those damn fries, they're a teetering, steaming mound of volcanic-hot waffles covered with perfectly browned cheese, a precisely-measured dollop of chili almost-omg-almost spilling past the wax paper keeping it all contained for the walk from the window to the table. 5 times now. A piece of food sculpture, almost. I stare at them for just a sec, enjoying them as an object, before diving in, forks flying. Recent discovery - yellow mustard is killer as a dip.  They set a high bar, only to be approached by the corn dog and pickles. Falafel's getting better, but is still eh. Burger, pasty, good. Salads are totally edible, if you must, but not impressive. But the pickles, those gonna-be-the-huge-gut-of-me fries, and the corndog, at least one of the three has to head down my esophagus weekly or this happens - craving to the point of distraction.  You win, Pinky's. You win."}
{"text":"*just found out today they are no longer dog-friendly but love this restaurant, great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Food is always good here. As a vegan I really appreciate that they have a separate menu that has all of their vegan option. They also are never annoyed if you ask about those options either.  I recommend the veggie dog and onion straws as my favs. The veggie dog cones with yummy chill that had a nice,flavorful kick too it.  This is a casual, fun place with great food and a great staff. Been to both locations and have never had anything less than good food and great service."}
{"text":"This forsure is my ultimate go to spot. Especially after a night of drinking lol. They have heathy options, fatty fried options / cheesy things and decent prices ! The atmosphere is super dope and they have good customer service. And the bartenders are cool"}
{"text":"super cool spot! love the decor and fun vibe. Delicious burger! pimento cheese fries... what???   Why doesn't Pittsburgh have pimento cheese?  check it yo!"}
{"text":"Never have I ever has bad service or bad food at this place. You can't go wrong with getting anything on this menu!   I've had all of the tacos on the menu and my favorite is the Korean BBQ. They also have Pimento cheese fries that make my heart stop with happiness/fatty things blocking my arteries.   10/10 recommend at all times. I may even name my first born child Pinky."}
{"text":"Great food! Prices are awesome. Staff is very friendly. It is a bit loud inside, but worth it for the Pinkys experience."}
{"text":"I love Pinky's! The environment is laid back and unique. Burgers are fantastic, not huge so if your are starving, order accordingly. Great fries and salads too!"}
{"text":"Pros: Fast service Lots of menu choices Quite a bit of parking   Cons: It's very popular and can get pretty busy, so you may have to wait a bit.    This is a lunch spot staple for me. There are so many options and the food is great and consistent. It's great for a quick and casual lunch. No frills."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I went into Pinky's to grab some takeout before watching Wrestlemania 30 and it was a great decision. First off, the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant completely suit my personality, so I was in heaven the moment I walked in the door. I placed my order and it was ready in no more than 10 minutes. The Turkey sandwich was out of this world and the hush puppies were fried to golden perfection. I finished the meal off with some banana pudding that reminded me of how my grandma used to make it. All in all, I can't recommend this place enough and I'll certainly be dropping by a few more times before I leave."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic there creations with food is great I love the atmosphere and service 9/10"}
{"text":"The issue with Pinky's the parking if you didn't know you would think the parking in front of the restaurant which sits on the curb is the only parking when in fact there's more in the back but its not paved. If it rains it can be muddy. It has a great skyline view and the resturant itself has been expanded to a  larger outside and inside. The pimento cheese waffle fries are so good. I also love the crab hush puppies and hotdogs. They have drink specials and drinks are really good as well."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Pinky's Westside grill and it won't be my last. We arrived just before the lunch time rush, so we were seated fairly quickly. The service was wonderful. We had several of the waitstaff who came and checked on us throughout our visit. My wife ordered the patty melt and i had the mammoth burger with cheese. We did not have to wait very long before our food was brought out. My burger was cooked to perfection; not over done and had a delicious flavor. My wife enjoyed her patty melt, as well. If you're ever on the west side, don't miss the opportunity to check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is really cool. It's kinda funky and weird but very good. The food was really good and the service was really good too. Very good for vegetarians as well."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for dinner while visiting town.  With great Yelp reviews and a stop on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives I felt I was in good hands.  To top it off my uber driver raved about it so I went in feeling pretty confident.    To start, they had Firefly vodka, one of my favorites!  You don't find many places where I'm from serving it.  So I got one of the $5 cocktails with it, yum tasted like summer!    Also, pimento cheese isn't super prominent where I live so I took every chance I could to have it on just about anything while I was in town.  I zeroed in on the Pimp'n Fries and there was no turning back, melted pimento cheese over waffle fries, just the comfort food I needed!  Since it was just me and I was towards the end of my stay I knew getting one of their raved about burgers would be a waste since I was pretty content with my Firefly and Pimento Cheese fries for dinner.  BUT in the effort of being a little bit of a responsible adult I ordered the chicken tacos.  I was actually pleasantly surprised, the meat was very tender and the toppings were all really fresh, a nice compliment to the very decadent fries I was inhaling.   Atmosphere is fun and funky (true of most Triple D stops) and the service was great.  Everyone was super friendly and very accommodating.  A great way to round out my stay!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently good. They have a great drink list (although I often opt for the classic shirley temple). We normally share the pimento cheese fries, which are delicious and totally worth the lactose induced stomachache that follows for me. My go to here is the veggie burger, white trash style. It is so delicious and eventhough I eat meat, this is my favorite item here and I would venture to say that it is my favorite veggie burger. My boyfriend has tried the fish, the burgers, the hotdogs, etc. and has yet to have anything he doesn't like. Overall, this is a great local spot."}
{"text":"The only thing keeping me from giving this place 5 stars is the parking... even though I know I will not find a spot up front and have to walk up from the back dirt lot, I still drive through and get my hopes up! Aside from that, everything else is amazing. The staff takes care of everyone - it's definitely a team effort and it works well. The crab puppies are delicious and so are the burgers and the buffalo chicken. On Saturdays, the liquor is 1/2 off and the wedding punch and white gummy bear drinks are dangerously good. Oh and they have a cement triceratops out front."}
{"text":"grabbed a late breakfast/brunch when visiting charlotte ordered the crab hush puppies, pimento cheese waffle fries, and the white trash burger  the pimento cheese waffle fries were AMAZING.. at first. then they got kind of sickening:/ and then along with the hush puppies and the burger (which has fried onion rings in it) .. it was just too much fried greasiness for me  friend tried the burger thai style(?) and liked it.. i definitely recommend NOT order ALL fried greasy food and balancing out the meal"}
{"text":"Great spot to eat!!! Lived everyting I've ever ordered. And mg drink was the bomb too!!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for an eclectic restaurant ? A place that stimulates both your vision and taste buds? Pinky's Westside Grill is your place! Located in a the corner of a busy intersection, they only have 3 parking spots in the parking lot in front of the restaurant. You will have to park in a dirt lot located behind the business. Not an issue unless its raining.   I ordered the Pimpin' french fries with chili as an appetizer and they were delicious! Order a side a ranch, just to make it a tad healthier ;) Loved the waffle cut fries they use for this dish because it allows for more surface for the cheese and chili! Maybe I would add jalapenos next time too! I ordered a White Trash Cheese burger and I will never order a cheese burger another way!! This cheese burger came with pickles and fried onion strips.. YUMMM... I added some mustard and maybe would have added some jalapenos as well.. .but that might just be my pregnancy craving at the moment. HAHA.  Service was great, food came out fast and outdoor seating is also available. 5 stars! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Pinky's is one of my go-to spots to eat in Charlotte. We usually hit this place after blowing quarters on House of the Dead and pinball at Abari. The food and service is just always very good, and we've been there three times.  I would say the best thing to get is their wings; get them extra hot if you dare! I recently tried a double cheeseburger, \"ding dong style\". The flavor was definitely unique, but for a more filling stomach, I would recommend you get the wings and waffle fries -- they have good flavor and aren't very pricey.  It can be ultra crowded at times, but Pinky's is a really fun place to eat while in the Queen City, especially for the wings alone."}
{"text":"The first time we came to Pinkies was almost an accident. We had planed to be at Food Truck Friday but were rained out.   So, group of 16 people, Friday night, and no reservations anywhere. Crap!  Somehow we ended up at Pinkies. If you've ever passed this place then you know it's impossible to miss. The giant VW Beetle painted with Stars and Stripes on the roof is hard to ignore.   We shuffled in and luckily we are all friends because the waiting area it kitchy and fun, but also small! Thankfully none of us had B.O. and impressively we were all seated in less that 15 minutes!  Now the menu! Pinkies is like no place I've been before. There are some \"normal\" choices but most of the menu is a hodge podge of odd combinations most with interesting names.   Things like Wasabi Ranch Dressing are available and leave you in a strange place of excitement to try something unusual and fear of having no idea what anything will taste like because its all so different!  I can't remember what I got but I ordered the strangest thing I could find on the menu and it was amazing!   I've been back three times and ordered different items and found them all somewhere on the scale of decent-to-great. Nothing has bombed yet!  The food is interesting and they do a great job of combining odd things and making them work. The prices are fantastic, especially for the adventurous menu, which is further encouragement to try new things!  Service is hit or miss like many places. It really depends on the night and the server but if you come with a group of friends and share a beer or two, you'll probably not even notice.   Overall, Pinkies is a great place for \"Foodies\" and budget minded people alike."}
{"text":"Always great food and fast service. Tried the specials a couple of weeks ago - Asian pork burger with honey cilantro slaw and Korean BBQ as well as the squash bisque. Both were absolutely delicious.  I usually get the kinda fried turkey with a pimpin fries opener. I don't even love turkey most of the time but this is great!"}
{"text":"After hearing of what a glorious place penguin is and that this is dome how affiliated I had high expectations. After reading the menu... Even higher.   Wow was I let down.  Pinky's is on the corner of Morehead and Freedom Drive.  Across from The Burger Company and a Tattoo Parlor.  The exterior is actually pretty cool looking.  There is an old VW bug on the roof, a triceratops statue outside, and the building looks like an old garage converted to a restaurant.  Inside has some interesting decor, seems they're trying to be a little unique and they are.  Parking... wow.  There are about 6 parking spots, don't even bother pulling in.  Just park across the street and walk.  Seriously, traffic can be bad and the one way in one way out can be a pain when there are 6 cars in the lot.  I hate to give a bad review and I will come back, but my experience wasn't the greatest.  Walking in you'll have a small waiting area with a hostess stand with a hostess present most of the time.  To your right you'll have the dining area and bar.  The night I went there were two servers, and a bartender.  To place an order you go to the bar which is typical, but be careful waiting in the waiting area.  You'll have to check on your order.  There were two men in Pinky's uniform in addition to the women working the floor and bar.  I asked one for some help or if he could check on my order and was told \"I'm not working I'm just making sure things go ok here.\"  Yea well 20 minutes after being told 10 minutes and I still dont have my order, things aren't ok.  Turns out it was just sitting behind the bar.  I guess I should have asked more often.  I ordered the Ding Dong Chick and crab puppies.  I'm not sure where they get Thai style  with the chicken, tasted exactly like it sounds.  Is that even possible? For sound to taste?  Anyways you know what I mean.  Ding Dong Chicken:  Grilled chicken breast, crunchy peanut butter, cole slaw.  Just didn't do my palette justice.  But hey they say not to try it first so its hard to knock it.  I just expected a little more spice or flavor in the chicken.  The Crab puppies... think hush puppies with crab meat in them.  Thats what the description says, what they lack is actual crab meat.  They were big deep fried hush puppy balls, I tore every one up and had others try them.  No taste of crab what so ever nor site of any meat.  Pourina tried them too and his elite taste buds could not sense any crab either.  Needless to say, sounds like growing pains.  I will try again but my lord if your going to offer crab puppies put some damn crab meat in them!!!"}
{"text":"Another Triple D joint and you won't be disappointed!! A super cool funky interior offers a warm and friendly vibe with intriguing decor.  The burger was delicious!  We got the mammoth with everything and added pimento cheese.  The pimento cheese was oozey and melted perfectly while the beef patties offered tons of flavor without being overly salty.  It made it into Damon's top 10 burgers off all time which is extremely tough! When in Charlotte Pinky's is a must!"}
{"text":"Holy shit, the food is freaking awesome!  First time here, everything looks so good when looking at other table's food. My burger was great, waffle fries were perfect. Coming back to try it all."}
{"text":"The one time I went here I was not impressed. Not only was none of their salad dressing tolerable, but they don't give you much food for the price. The worst part was how rude our waitress was. Every time we asked for something, she would throw it on the table on her way by. I know everyone loves it,  but we personally had a bad experience that I would not go back for."}
{"text":"I always like to try anything that has been on Diners Drive ins and Dives.  I had the Reuben hot dog.  I will try the Korean BBQ tacos next time.  I had a bite of my son's and it was delicious. Everything we ordered was delicious. Service was great and also a great place to take children.    We had a bonus dessert of banana pudding that was amazing for my birthday.    We would highly recommend this place for great food, atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"My wife and I checked this place out Saturday for lunch.  We ordered their crab hushpuppies for an appetizer and they were amazing!  My wife ordered their turkey sandwich and I ordered the white trash burger.  We were both very happy with our order.  She got sweet potatoe fries and I got onion rings.  We will definitely be going back to Pinkys!  The price was very reasonable and the service was exceptional!  The atmosphere was lovely also.  Yummy, definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"After seeing this restaurant on Dinners Drive in and Dives, I tried it and was disappointed with the food.  The service was great,but the food items were not the best.  I would give it 2 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"I went here after a canceled flight and a first \"date\". Great atmosphere and fast, efficient, and friendly service. The food was not the greatest but the atmosphere and the newness of it all was enough that I want to go back there eventually.  I assume that I should probably try out a few more items on the menu to get a completely unbiased opinion. Otherwise I still feel that the portions are large and the service and amazing vibe made up for it."}
{"text":"I've been to Pinky's before and always had solid food with good service, but never gotten around to writing a review... I checked out a tip from a fellow Yelper the other day and decided to swing by for lunch pick up since options are pretty scarce around my office...   I was able to place a to-go order over the phone fairly easily without a long hold time at all... Upon arriving, I had to park across the street which I kind of expected... If you haven't been, the parking lot is probably about 10 spaces, if that... Across the street, there are marked spaces in the Dunkin Donuts parking lot... Make sure to use those... I don't know if they tow, but who wants to find out?  I arrived about 10 minutes after placing my order and my food was all ready to go... Definite plus... When you're working with limited time, not having to stand around waiting for food you called in is absolutely awesome... As usual, the servers were quick and very friendly...   I ordered the Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich as tacos and it was amazing... I don't typically like crunchy peanut butter, but I barely even noticed those peanuts...  Between the honey-cilantro slaw and the yum yum sriracha, it had a great Thai-like flavor... I decided to be healthy and ordered the fried squash as well... The breading was light and crispy... A great crunch without completely taking over the flavor or overpowering the veggie...   One of the most important parts for a to-go order is food temperature and Pinky's really held up in that aspect... By the time I got back to my office, the food was still piping hot and delish...  I finally have another lunch place! Yes!"}
{"text":"We like the other Pinky's, but I was meeting someone at lake so ate at Pinky's Huntersville Sunday for the first time. Very pleasant restaurant. Similar decor to Uptown, but much roomier and the music was not too loud (thanks! we could hear each other). Food was same as uptown. We had the crab puppies, Greek pitas, and a hot dog. I noticed children eat free on Mondays. They had outdoor seating. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"Corn dog shrimp basket....heaven. But what I'm really mad about is that I completely missed the drink menu so I have to go back just for that. The rest of the menu looked completely appetizing but I couldn't order everything.  plus they have turkey burgers and vegetarian food options"}
{"text":"A great little spot for a good burger and a drink. We always share one a la carte side. I get the smallest burger and my boyfriend always goes for one side up and never finishes his, because the small is still a generous size. It can be loud because they are always busy and the wait can be uncomfortable as they don't have a large area for that. One of our favorite  burger spots for sure."}
{"text":"First the food is not bad and the staff is friendly enough. But 2 negative experiences leave a me with no intention of returning. 1st time in I went and sat at a table in the bar area alone. I waited 10 minutes and no one acknowledged me... So I went to sit at the bar instead. She was busy so I was fine, it happens. Then today I ordered an item a specific way to go. When I got home it was wrong. So I called to have them remake it correctly for me to come back for. I guess the girl taking my order thought I said it was written up incorrectly as opposed to being made wrong because t was made incorrectly again. At this point I'm done. But the girl started to ever slightly blame me for the miscommunication before back stepping and accepting her misunderstanding of what I said. Which I ordered it twice now and I know i didn't say it incorrectly. So I told them I didn't want it anymore and I wanted a refund. Hopefully in a couple days I'll have my money back on the card.   Let me reiterate that the staff was pleasant enough the entire time and quick to try and correct issues. So the staff and the food, when made correctly, is worth maybe 4 stars. But with 2 negative experiences and I've only been twice I can't find a reason to award more than 2 stars. I do not plan to return here again. But if for some reason I do and I have no issues then maybe I'll feel compelled to return and revise this review for the better."}
{"text":"We had the fish tacos, a 500 dog,  a side of homemade chips,  and the crab puppies. Everything was excellent,  service was great,  and extremely quick.  We went at lunch,  not sure how dinner will compare but can't wait to try them again!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. These people made the penguin what it became and then got screwed hard on making a deal with the property owner. Ironically the penguin just closed for good and this place is rocking everyday.  Line out the door during prime times."}
{"text":"Yet another on my quest to try the \"Best\" burger places in Charlotte.  I had lunch at Pinky's on a Saturday afternoon.  In a common trend now-a-days, Pinky's is in a repurposed gas station.  The weather was nice and they had the garage doors open.  I got there about 15-20 minutes after they opened so it wasn't too busy yet.  I ordered the mammoth burger, which is  two 5 oz patties.  I opted for everything, which is mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion & dill pickles.  I also ordered a side of waffle fries and a side of onion rings.  My food came out very quickly, I don't think I even had time to read the front page of my paper yet.  All the food looked delicious.  The burger was juicy, but didn't have as much flavor as I wanted.  Still it was very good, cooked to just being legal.  The waffle fries were hot and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, cooked perfectly.  The onion ring, well what can I say about those rings.  If I had to pick one word it would be nirvana.  They were some of the best onion rings I have ever had.  They were sliced thin, with the breading barely clinging to them.  The onions were sweet tasting and the breading had a nice flavor.  They did have quite a bit of grease though.  The service was fantastic.  It might have been because it was still slow, but most of the staff that passed by asked how everything was and if I needed anything, not just my server, but all the wait staff and even the hostess.  Not quite the best burger I've had in Charlotte, but it is close to the top."}
{"text":"Love this location drinks are good food is good quick sevice ! Thanks need to allow dogs on patio since you are  next to running trail/walking trail.pet friendly it's 2017"}
{"text":"Came to Pinky's with friends while on my Keto diet . The menu looks so appetizing, different combinations that I would have loved to try. I had a simple 5oz pterodactyl burger with bacon, cheese, and mushrooms, pickles (no bun). It was very delicious! Everyone at the table enjoyed their choices. Surprisingly my friend got the soup special-crab bisque & she said it was tasty; it had chunks of crab & potato. Can't wait to try some of the other options post-keto."}
{"text":"White Trash Burger. Get it . Amazing. I am in town fit business and was glad to stumble upon  this location since I have been to and loved the location downtown. The prices are great too. The service and wait staff if friendly and was very informative. Check this place out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A great diner style restaurant. The food is cheap and tasty. I got the pinky dog which was overflowing with chili and pimento cheese. The sweet potato chips were also very good. It's hard to go wrong with an order here. The burgers, hotdogs, and tacos are all good. I've never been there with someone that didn't like what they ordered."}
{"text":"Love Pinkys. Their pimento cheese anything is so good, especially the Pinky Dog. Would eat here all the time if it wouldn't take years off my life :)"}
{"text":"White Trash Burger, ALWAYS. so delicious!"}
{"text":"Best rated burger joint with price and quality hands-down. It may not look like a whole lot from the outside, but you should be able to tell my the locals mixed with visitors it's a hot-spot.  - Friendly servers and atmosphere - Quality food - Can be a bit messy, careful! - Reasonably priced - Parking can be tricky - Check the photos!  You can easily get lunch for two under $20 with drinks and starter.  I finished up a Spartan Race and headed over to Pinky's to recoup. I needed a massive amount of protein and some potassium for my aching body.  I ordered up some some fried pickles because they usually hit the spot when your starving and don't take long to get to your table. Greg's pickles ($3.95 small) were tasty but not my favorite part of the meal, just too greasy.  I love the whole concept of ordering burgers here, basically you pick 1-3 5oz patties and choose from three styles and can add any additions. EVERYTHING includes mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion & dill pickles. I ordered the WESTSIDE which comes with mustard, chili, slaw & onion. You can also pick DING DONG STYLE with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce. Whatever floats your boat!  The Mammoth westside style ($5.75) was such a beast. It wasn't very wide but was quite the skyscraper. Can you say jaw fatigue? It really hit the spot.   My wife picked up the Green Chile Pork ($6.25) and we both loved it. You can't go wrong with marinated pork grilled with pineapple slices, melted swiss cheese, arugula and jamaican mayonnaise on a seeded bun. The sauce had so much flavor and pineapple added such a boost.  I loved this place, although I could have went without the pickles. This will be a place I stop at often when in the area!"}
{"text":"Pinky's has never disappointed me in the 40+ times that I've been there. It's roadside burgers and fries food but done creatively and consistently. It's well priced too. I usually get the pimpin fries with the vegetarian chili and a burger. It's always delicious. Even the martinis aren't bad if you're feeling a mix of trashy/fancy like me. Patio is great too."}
{"text":"Could be 5 and will be back again. Fantastic funky decor, friendly staff and constant soda refills were great. Burger and roll were just slightly uninspired. Tried \"white trash\", good but slightly overlooked, wanted more spice. Service 10 Atmosphere 10 Burger 8 Salad 9"}
{"text":"I enjoy a chill place to eat at with friends to have a good time.  Pinky's is exactly the place.  The place is fairly new, and just has a nice vibe to in when you walk in.  I like how they have a video game machine to play if you're waiting for a table.  I'm lucky that I always have some change while waiting.  I also love their photobooth snuggled in the corner.  I've definitely used that before.  Now their food is amazing!  Yes, a lot of friend unhealthy stuff, but the tasty goodness in your mouth is worth not counting those calories.  I always order the crab puppies, everyone should at least try it out!  Their fried squash is also amazing.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I first ordered it, but I'm glad that I did because I kept wanting more.  The only burger that I order there is the White Trash Burger that has provolone, fried pickles and onion rings, and a spicy ranch sauce.  Sounds delish right?  Go and get this burger now!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I visited this place. They'll surely be seeing more of me. Great food and exactly the beer selection I want. The staff was awesome yet kind. I am vegetarian and I haven't seen such a variety that also tastes good. These folks are rad!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were fortunate enough to attend an event here last week (sorry for the late review)... This is, as I understand it, a newer and second location following their location in Charlotte. The owner was kind enough to host the event to showcase the great offerings & atmosphere at this Huntersville location.  It is near the hospital off of Exit 23. It's on the corner of a stip-mall of sorts next to a few other restaurants and establishments. The decor was a bit mixed with these bright red (Asian-like) paper lanterns throughout. There are several TVs and plenty of seating. If I had to describe it, I'd describe the decor as DIY American Bar with a modern and interesting flair. You're immediately greeted by a friendly hostess, seating is straight ahead (booths & tables) before the bar. The bathrooms are in the very back to the left of the bar and were both clean and easy to locate.   So, for the food... and forgive me, I'm stealing my overview of the food from my review of the event. However, I figure that's OK because I want to share my thoughts with prospective customers who probably wouldn't see the event page...  At our event, we were presented with a table covered with different foods to try (mostly fried bar-food). There was this stuff that looked like light green wasabi  (turned out to be artichoke hummus I think - pretty good actually), and some seemingly homemade pita chips. Those were both fantastic. Just the right amount of crisp to the chips, and the dip was seasoned perfectly. They also brought out some sliders - oh my! They were quite good - juicy, well seasoned, flavorful with these awesome crispy onions on them. I believe they're called \"white trash burgers.\" Well heck, call me white trash - these were good! I would definitely get sliders again on my next visit.   What else... oh yeah, there was fried tofu, which, sadly was not good at all. As a former vegetarian, I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to tofu and I know they can be prepared in a number of ways. Well, they were lightly/flash fried (perfect texture really) but had absolutely zero flavor or sauce. They had potential, but it's almost as though they skipped the final step - sauce of some kind.  There were a few different kinds of dips, and fresh veggies which were refreshing to see with the fried-food-focus here. They also had these fried poppers (jalapenos) that we all ran to grab when they first came out... Well, one table-mate was a bit disappointed to find his had no spice at all. So, being the spice-wimp I am, I took a big bite. My particular one was pretty spicy! So while they seemed to be a mixed bag, they really were not tasty. The filling was bland and the outside tasted like cornmeal (which wasn't a bad thing). But when I get a dish like this, I want mild heat and an abundance of flavor inside, which was lacking.  Overall, I would say the food is traditional American/bar fare and it was good. The location seems to be easy to access and in a well populated area of Huntersville. The owner was on site and he was very warm, welcoming and enthusiastic. You can tell he is passionate about this place. Would I go back the next time I wanted some beer and good American food, yes - I would. Give it a try, there are plenty of tasty options to choose from."}
{"text":"This place is cheap and yummy!   You can sit inside or outside, but if you go at dinner time, you may have to wait a little bit.   Wait staff is on top of it.   You will never have to wait long!   Burgers are great, as are the fish tacos!    The fried pickles are amazing as well!    It is definitely casual, but a trendy, good spot for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Came here late on a Friday night thinking there wouldn't be a wait. Naive new Charlotteans, we are. Luckily there was space at the bar. The place is fun, quirky, and cozy. No-nonsense dive. Exactly how I like it.  We ordered the White Trash Burger and the Maddy Paddy Melt. Both reasonably priced at less than $6 each. No sides included though. We shared a basket of loaded fries.  My boyfriend simply said, \"That's a damn good burger.\" We'll be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here!  The burger I had was good & sweet potato fries were delicious! The staff was excellent and so fast. They have great drink specials and an awesome environment. I felt like home with all the amazing rock decor. Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Visited last evening, crowded as expected for Friday night, but we were seated quickly. Music was good but a little loud for conversation.  Had the Pterodactyl Burger with Pepper Jack and it was very good! Definitely not a frozen patty thrown on a grill! Our party had onion rings, waffle fries, sweet potato fries and hush puppies, agreed these were all okay but nothing special. Staff was nice. Would visit again"}
{"text":"Great prices!  Large, eclectic menu and super fast and friendly service.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the tiki bar type setting.  So many unusual decorative items they are a conversation piece in themselves. Fun drink coasters with brain teasers.  No fun details were overlooked.    The waitstaff tag teams all the tables so patrons have everything they need and there is a fantastic team environment.    I had the white trash turkey burger with onion rings.  The next time I will order something different.  I couldn't taste the provolone cheese, and the turkey burger tasted just like beef.  So much so, I needed to double check!  The onion rings are a huge portion...  Don't even attempt to eat it alone.  The entire family can eat here without breaking the budget.  Parking is way on the other side of the restaurant. On Friday there is an evening rush that starts around seven.  Make sure you get there before then.  An umbrella fell on my sisters head and they deducted $3.75  from our check, which is the reason this place didn't earn four stars."}
{"text":"I had yet another great experience with Pinkys today! Went in for a quick beer and lunch and left a happy man! I had the Mammoth burger with everything and pimiento cheese, mammoth is right, this burger was huge! The toppings were fresh and delicious and the pimiento cheese was some of the best I've ever had. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Went back this time know the policy of having all guest there before getting a table. Which the host didn't tell us about until we were there for 20 min, but I digress. I went back to try the food at this location. The service was okay a little bit of an attitude from the employees but nothing horrible. The food wasn't as good as the huntersville location. The food was subpar at this location."}
{"text":"I love this place. Whenever I'm in the area, I look forward to a meal here. It's really cute inside and the staff is always cheerful and helpful, but the really impressive thing is the FOOD. This place knows their pub grub and knows it well. I have never had better fried pickles. Their burgers are awesome. They have a good selection of beer, and their servers are well versed in the beer selections. They have a number of vegetarian options. My fella is vegetarian and he really enjoys the Nature Boy veggie burger served white trash style, and meat eater that I am, I have to say I am tempted to try it someday, it looks really good. If you are in the area, you really owe it to yourself to try this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was such a cool little spot ! The setting is  casual and has a fun vibe . I ordered the White Trash Burger ( fun names always a plus ) it was so delicious . It had fried pickles , onion rings and a beef patty super good . The bun was simple which really made the burger .   I also tried the hot wings . Excellent , asked for them extra crispy and they were    I will return and definitely a place to try out ."}
{"text":"Love the veg options. They make sure they get you what you want. A little mod here and there and it's good!! Great stuff. Definitely can visit once or twice a week."}
{"text":"Heading to Pinky's right now!!  Dreaming of peanut butter on my burger and a big bowl of puddin'. This place is the best go to place to hit before a show in Charlotte.  The service is fast and consistent. Guaranteed good time every time!!"}
{"text":"The Pimp 'n Fries were amazing.  I wanted to go back the next day and get them again! We had the Pimp'n Fries with pimento cheese melted over crispy, seasoned waffle fries and buffalo chicken bites on top.  I gave a 4 instead of 5 because they forgot part of our to go order. We didn't realize it until we were all the way back at the house."}
{"text":"My favorites include the pimento grilled cheese sandwich and the Pinky dog (also with Pimento cheese!) I always order the fries smothered with pimento cheese and I'm always disappointed, though. The cheese is always overcooked, as if it was fried in the microwave too long. Note to self: stop ordering that!  In news other than pimento cheese, the corn dog shrimp are delicious. It's basically what you'd think: Corn dog batter wrapped around jumbo shrimp. I order it with blue cheese and buffalo dips. Speaking of dips, they are amazing, and so is the ranch. Very nicely done.   NOT good for large groups, as they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived. As I tend to hang with people that simply cannot show up on time, it makes for a tough venue. But with 2-3 people, it's a great experience and I always love enjoying my cheat meal here!"}
{"text":"Good food! Great friendly people! Crabby puppies were great! Loved the sauce. We would go back! White trash burger great! Patsy melt great. Big John great! Little noisy but fun atmosphere. Staff was awesome!"}
{"text":"Pinkys was great. Had the recommended ding dong sandwich and my wife had the big John and both were cooked too perfection. Fries were good too."}
{"text":"I ate way too much fried food.   We ordered the pickle chips and crab hushpuppies for starters. Both were really good though I didn't taste a lot of crab in the hushpuppies, they seemed to be more bread. For dinner, I ordered the Corn Dog Shrimp basket. That's jumbo shrimp fried in corn dog batter which is just as tasty as it sounds. It came with waffle fries and a cup of slaw. The slaw was pretty good but it was a little sharper in taste than I would have preferred.   The restaurant decor is really fun and funky. Lots of tiki and retro horror kitsch stuff. They have an extensive menu of cocktails and over $2.50 drafts on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Great little burger joint I love the names of the hamburgers. I had the white trash burger very good tasting the atmosphere was pretty cool it was pretty crowded also I would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Saw Pinky's construction and was excited to have a new eatery right across the street from where I live.  Came in on New Years Day and saw they were open, so that's perfect. Atmosphere:  I like it.  Very artsy, decently loud music playing, cute female staff with tattoos (love artsy chicks!)  Vintage pinball machine in entrance.  I know of the other restaurant's location versus this one, and the tough thing about putting a restaurant like this in an area that's basically suburbia, you kinda have to alter your business a little bit to accommodate the locals.  What may work in an atmosphere of a walk in eatery in some areas may not work as well in an area where most people are going to go to sit-down type restaurants.    Had the grilled chicken salad.  Great portion, tender chicken.   The rest of my party's food was served in those little checkered trays you'd get fries in back in the 70's and 80's... and are honestly way too small to accommodate a burger, let alone something with sides.  My recommendations to the restaurant owner:  Upgrade what you are serving food on.  Heck, even some Chinet would be an improvement.  You don't have to go all fancy, but please upgrade to something that is a)easier for your staff to handle, and b) holds more. Also, MAKE A KIDS MENU!  Look at your area:  You have 3 daycare centers within a half mile of you,  with a 4th being build right behind Earth Fare, multiple housing developments within a 2 mile radius, an apartment community directly across the street... what does that equal?  A LOT of people with kids.  Know your clientele.  This isn't a downtown area-- you are in Leave it to Beaver land, and I can guarantee Ward and June don't feel like cooking when Eddie Haskel is stopping by.  It's still a new restaurant, so i will give them time to adapt and get rid of those french fry trays they are serving food in.  Plus, I like the cute tattoo girls, so I will be back just for that :-)"}
{"text":"Once you take the first bite, you'll want to try everything on the menu. Not kidding!!"}
{"text":"New Year's Day lunch since we did New Year's Eve at home.  Got the last remaining parking spot and stepped inside.  Noticed that the interior featured the macabre.....skulls, skeletons and the like, which I love!   Seating is close together in this small, but charming spot.  Good wine specials,  but my husband was a bit dismayed to see a half inch head on his first draft beer (second one was better).  I was thrilled to see vegan and vegetarian options on the menu.  I ordered the tahini salad, which featured falafel on greens with feta, tomato, cucumber and onion.  Plus, a tahini dressing that wasn't bad.  Salad for days, so I shared with the husband.  He got the turkey burger and also ended up ordering fried pickles, which were delightfully crispy and served with plentiful Ranch dressing. I didn't like that everything came in paper, except for the drinks.  I am sure it saves them on dish washing, but I like eating from real plates and bowls, especially salad. The host and all of the servers were extra sweet.  That is a plus in this age of rude and abrupt. Bottom line:  I wanna go again!"}
{"text":"First time visit here knowing that this restaurant was on Diners, Drive-ins, and dives. Pinky's is a fun burger joint and it's good for lunch. The atmosphere is relax and good to hang out with friends. I went with my friends and we started with the crab puppies for our appetizer. They were decent for how much they cost (13 of them for $5.50)   My friend had the Mammoth, which came with 5 oz. patties plus cheese. You can choose any kind of cheese you want for a dollar a piece. The burger was pretty bland and bad. We were super disappointed. We were warned before they cook burger well done here, but never thought it would be so dry and no flavors at all like this.   Everything they serve to you is on plastic or paper like other people said. Be aware of that.  We were really disappointed at their service as well. The service was horrible and their staffs weren't attentive at all. We came for lunch at 11.30 and got seated after 20 of waiting. Then, another 20-30 minutes of asking what would you like to drink. Another 30 minutes of food coming out. We were done at that point.  I'm sorry Pinky's but this is not for us. Not sure if I wanted to go back."}
{"text":"We loved everything about this place. The atmosphere, customer service, and food were all excellent. The prices were reasonable as well. I tried the ding dong chicken and am glad I took the chance to try something so out of my comfort zone. I will be going back when I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place has a fun atmosphere with delicious food! The waitstaff was great with everyone kind of tag-teaming all the tables to make sure everyone had what they needed. We had the Pimpnfries, corn dog shrimp, and a cheeseburger, it was all very good. There are also vegetarian and healthier options which is great! Highly recommend this fun and yummy spot!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Food is not the best and the service was terrible the two times I have visited."}
{"text":"cheap, good food.  I'm partial to the pterodactyl w/everything and the fried pickles (and maybe some crab pups), but Pinky's never lets me down when I graze to other parts of the menu. I've never ordered something new and been disappointed, so that wins points in my book.  My only problem is that every time I want to try the taco special they're already out of it, but then again I don't always eat my meals at a respectable hour.   Service is usually great- but sometimes just good, mixed drinks have never seemed weak, and you can't complain about the music or the nightly specials. I can take my parents there when they're in town or I can have a less respectable evening throwing back a few with friends, but best of all I could close my eyes and point to anything on the menu and be pretty satisfied with whatever it was, and the price attached to it."}
{"text":"This should be your new favorite lunch spot. I love both locations but THIS ONE has so much more space. The servers are so cool s and attentive. The food is exciting and I've tried nothing that I didn't like. My favorite is any of the tacos!"}
{"text":"I definitely prefer the location off Freedom/W. Morehead based off service. Maybe since that location is smaller, they want to get people moving quicker... I'm not really sure.   Parking is a breeze due to this Pinky's being connected to many other shops. They are definitely in a prime area right of Gilead. Ambiance is real chill and laid back. Huge dining area with clean bathrooms.  Service was barely decent. You ever have that feeling that a server just doesn't want to be there. That was the feeling that me and may family felt the entire time. And it was my birthday lunch so everyone was in a good happy mood until the moment we got seated.   Food is good and never heavy. I've never had any complaints. I typically order burgers when I come here because they have quite a few interesting choices. I get the white trash burger or either the turkey burger. Everything is a la carte so you must add on sides.   Overall, expect good food when you come here. Expect reasonable prices. Don't expect anything from service."}
{"text":"Good food, great price. I came here fur lunch with a coworker and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was.   Service was quick and efficient.   I ordered a turkey burger and fries and my coworker ordered a salad. The food was spot on and was delicious.  Prices were reasonable and service was quick. Nothing about here specifically stood out but I can tell this is the place to go if you want a quick sit down meal.   Parking SUCKS but the service and food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Ive never had a bad experience at Pinkys.  Food is nothing crazy extravagant, however they do it right everytime.  The White Trash Burger is bomb, fried pickles are bomb, and my personal favorite is the corn dog shrimp.  Good vibes all around from the staff, and all the beers on tap are priced great."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Large portions. Great service, super fast. I went for lunch but it would be cool place to hang out after work."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere for a few drinks but the food doesn't seem as good as the original one Uptown."}
{"text":"I went to the Uptown location about 2 years ago and was blown away.  Surprised I haven't been back.  Hit the North Charlotte location for lunch and got the Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich.  It was surprisingly average.  It didn't help that I hit a couple of pieces of \"grizzle\"... that will ruin any eating experience.  The pimento fries were awesome.  One of the cooks or managers stopped by our table - nice touch - suggested we get bacon on them next time.    Maybe they were having an off day but I will definitely try again.  I should check online to confirm but it seemed like the menu was quite limited to what I remember from the uptown location.  Maybe lunch vs dinner menu?"}
{"text":"I am so glad we finally checked this place out.  We went late (for us) on a Friday - around 9PM.  Got very lucky with a spot in the lot right by door.  Had that not been available, I don't know where we would have parked.  Our wait for a table was only 20 minutes or so.  They do a \"shared\" wait staff approach.  Its awesome as you have someone checking on you regularly but not annoying.  Great beer selection.  Seating was comfortable... no cramming 5 people into a space for 3.  :-)  The burgers were out of this world!  All the food was fantastic.  My 19 y/o and I had the Triple G.  I took it down!  Wifey had the Maddy Patty Melt my other teenager had the Ding Dong Chicken and my younger son had chicken tenders.  The dies were awesome too."}
{"text":"Our first  visit to this location was a friday night right after they opened so we were anticipating a wait but fortunately for us they had two spots at the bar! We started with the fried pickles as an appetizer, which are always perfectly crispy.  We are both huge craft beer connoisseur's, so you can't go wrong with the \"beer roulette\"....what was even more awesome about this is the bartender asked what types you like first so they have an idea of what to surprise you with! For our meal's we both had the \"white trash burger\", ALWAYS one of my top choices, and a shared basket of waffle fries. Both locations have delicious, consistently good & greasy food however, I do prefer the \"artsy/eclectic\" atmosphere at the Morehead location more. Huntersville Pinky's seems to be more of a family friendly restaurant. For the convenience of this location I know we will be back especially when we want a \"cheat day\" meal!"}
{"text":"So allegedly after talking to a few Charlotte locals, I was told that the guy who established Penguins Drive-in ( a fav grease spoon of mine) left and opened up this arrangement of total yumminess in your mouth.    Well I tried the Veg hot dog and to my surprise is satisfied me in many ways. The crab puppies are to die for and the food was served fast and amazingly hot!   A great eatery and the prices are very very decent and it was nice to see the menu has expanded and offers some new creations but keeps it very american with a twist of fun."}
{"text":"What a great spot for good burgers and dog. We enjoyed both & they were served quickly and cheap prices. We also ordered a side of sweet potato fries, hot & cooked to perfection. I am a ketchup girl, but they served them with a creamy mustard dipping sauce that was a great second option."}
{"text":"Calling all vegetarians. The perfect vegetarian/ carnivore restaurant. The veggie chili I promise you won't miss the meat. I was so impressed with the vegetarian selection. I can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Love the food. Best place to get a Corndog when the fair isn't in town! The service kinda sucks though and the waiting staff makes you feel like talking to them is a burden. But the food is amazing ! Props to the cooking staff!"}
{"text":"Had a good lunch. Michaela was a great host and waitress.  She added humor but maintained the enlightened atmosphere. We had the vegaterian meals.  They really put an effort to what is your desire.  We also had the fried pickles.  A must have they were amazing. The service was continuous and friendly. Look forward to another adventure and different meal next time.."}
{"text":"Pinky's in Huntersville is definitely worth a try.    I've ordered take out a few times but have also visited the restaurant and eaten in.   Here's my latest experience.  The food:  Wonderful.    I ordered a Nature Boy - which is their vegetarian burger.   I believe it's a mixture of beans and sweet potatoes, but whatever it is... it's even more delicious than their regular beef burgers.   Although I'm not a vegetarian, this is my go to burger that they offer.   The fried pickles and fried squash are also my favorite.   They come out pretty crispy and both taste really good with a little bit of ranch dressing.    Atmosphere is loud - but tolerable.   Lots of music and interesting things to look at on the walls.   We had three different people helping us.  One person took our appetizer order and another took our meal order.   You can tell they try really hard to make sure you're taken care of quickly.   All servers and hosts had really good attitudes and were professional.  Price are reasonable also!   Only thing that I'm not a huge fan of are all of the paper products and plastic they use.   My burger came in a really small paper basket(?) and it was hard to manage.    Overall - very good.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was as good as always. Very good food - pretty much what you expect: huge, juicy burgers, awesome French fries, fun, lively, funky decor and friendly staff. Only complaint is that the fried squash is too thin cut and tasted mostly of the breading. Not bad but far from the best. I love going there and enjoying the atmosphere more than anything. Wasn't crowded for a Monday lunch and would've stayed there all day if I could've."}
{"text":"Great food. I just happened to stop at Pinky's for a quick lunch break  and was pleasantly surprised with the food and service. The place was busy with a nice crowd would go back again."}
{"text":"I would have to say the service was okay. But the food was not what I was expecting. After watching triple D I wanted to try this place out. I got the shrimp taco, it taste just like cheddar cheese and I just couldn't get that weird taste out of my mouth. Moving on to the fried pickles, it was greasy, and seems like the pickle doesn't want to stick to the batter. This isn't a place that I would go back to"}
{"text":"Went here and tried a bunch of menu items. Was pleasantly surprised with the ding dong chicken which is a grilled chicken sandwich with peanut sauce. Also good was the pimento cheese fries and the crab puppies"}
{"text":"I love Pinky's. The atmosphere is laid back and fun, and the music on the jukebox is usually awesome. The bar drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are great - ginger or cherry limeade is a must in the summer! They are the most vegetarian friendly restaurant I've ever encountered (that's not strictly a veggie restaurant) in the Charlotte area, and will make just about any substitution you ask for. Patio seating is really nice. One of my favorite Saturday lunch spots and Earth Faire is right across the street so it's easy to run over after and pick something up for dinner."}
{"text":"I guess it's time to update my review. I know everyone and their mothers LOVE Pinky's, but honestly I never feel that excited to be here. One reason... service is always spotty. You may have a good experience once, but chances are don't hold your breath.   I was here for lunch yesterday. I had to use the lady's room right away (that's what I got for drinking water like I should) and when the waiter stopped by I simply wasn't ready to order. I asked for a minute, and 15 minutes later the guy still hasn't stopped back by. Look, it's lunch, and I was in my work attires, meaning I don't have all day. And I kept staring at the waiter hoping to get some eye contact. He never once looked around or looked up. Everytime I thought he was heading our way, he would get stopped by something or someone, and turned around without once paying attention to our table. That's just annoying! I literally became that b!tch, and raised my arm waving like a maniac in hope to get some service.   When he finally stopped by, instead of offering an apology, he told us that he's not the only one who could have helped us.  REALLY? Well, since you didn't inform us that your restaurant has an open table/grab whoever you like policy, I thought you're MY waiter!   The only saving grace was the manager (I'm assuming she's the manager) stopped by and offered an explanation (something got mixed up at another table, which caused every waitstaff to stop whatever they're doing to un-mix the situation) and an apology. And she even offered up a banana pudding to go (which I gave to my coworkers because I don't really eat banana pudding - thus no comment can be made). 1 star for effort to make it right.  Food: I never know what to eat here. Typically I go with the burger (southern style), but they are very greasy. And for $5 you get a single burger (with cheese) and no side... a little steep. Yesterday I branched out and ordered the Green Chile Pork sandwich ($6.75). It was different, and I liked it (too bad I had to wolf in down in record time, which caused some serious discomfort immediately after). The pork wasn't overcooked but could be more seasoned. I like the use of arugula instead of lettuce. And the pineapple is refreshing (can be grilled a little more).  Overall food was a solid 3 star.   To sum it up: People who adore this place are still going to come here. For those who haven't visited, visit once to decide for yourself. I'm not the biggest fan, but it's a-ok.   P.S. Parking is still a pain. Now if you drive pass the place on the right there's an empty lot (instead of across the street which is now occupied by a new Dunkin' Donuts)  P.S. Tuesday is $2.50 draft beer special"}
{"text":"I am a little confused about the continued rave of this place.  While I remember visiting Pinky's quite a while ago and getting a good burger, my recent visits have been pretty boring.  The service is slow, and while people will try to explain that \"it's worth the wait!\"  I have not found that to be true.    Waiting 20 minutes to sit down at a table at 1pm seemed crazy when I saw open tables inside and out.  My last waitress seemed too busy for us, and just hurried to get our order.  Our burgers looked like they came from Five Guys - they were fine, just nothing to write home about, nor were they worth the wait.  It was a medium sized patty, plenty greasy, and a cheap bun.  The price is OK - total cost was only a few dollars lower than getting a cheeseburger from Firebirds though - and took just as long without the flavor and ability to order it Medium versus Pinky's standard Medium-well ONLY.    I won't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Comfort food in a trendy, eclectic diverse environment. The food is absolutely delicious, all ingredients fresh and were prepared to perfection. I had the monstrous burger white trash style with potato chips and deep fried pickles as an appetizer. Nothing frozen, every ingredient prepared daily.   My burger was a deconstructed and reconstructed cheese burger. All the ingredients you would see in a regular cheeseburger redone on a higher level. Onion straws and deep fried picked accompanied two fresh ground beef patties. The best burger I've had in a restaurant in years.   This will be my spot when I return to Huntersville."}
{"text":"Best greasy spoon in town. It has the right amount dirty and hipster. Ain't no hippie there. Not eco-friendly. We had the fried squash, pickles, onion rings and waffle fries as sides. Great place for vegheads. I loved the Stray dog (veggie friendly). They have vegan options too which is unheard of around these here parts. :) highly recommend the crab hush puppies. Son loved his white trash burger. Hub said the chicken sandwich was the best he ever had. We also had cherry limeade and ginger limeade. Bill was $38. Carried half our food out with us. Looking forward to reheating and beer later."}
{"text":"They have an awesome selection of food here for a cheap price. Peanut Butter and Sriracha chicken sandwich is my favorite. Would defiantly recommend."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and great food! I luv coming here...I order something different every time and its always good. Prices r good 2"}
{"text":"Service was great! Multiple servers checked on us and service was quick! We had the fried pickle chips for an appetizer and  White Trash burger and waffle fries. Good, not spectacular, but definitely didn't leave hungry. I had the Cheerwine 21 cocktail as well that was good. Will definitely come back if in the area."}
{"text":"Overall I liked this place.  The food was good, the servers were attentive and the atmosphere was chill.    The servers had a team game plan so someone was always asking if we needed anything but it wasn't over whelming.  We had the ancho chile wings and they were really good, a little heat but not too much and the wings themselves were well cooked.  We also had the crab pups which are hush puppies made out of crab cake type stuff and they were ok buT I'm not a huge fan of fried stuff.  We also got the Greek pita with chicken, Maybe the highlight of the meal.  All of the food was better than your typical bar food and very reasonably priced.  The only flaw I had was their beer selection was a little ho hum.  A few craft beers but nothing stood out.  I would had given five stars but they needed a bigger variety.    We would go back for sure to try a burger."}
{"text":"Again here is another Charlotte institutions that it took me to long to get to. I actually watched the episode of Triple D before going and was curious by cornbread battered shrimp which was amazing!  I was super surprised by the large amount of vegetarian options on the menu including veggie chili, veggie dogs, and even better the Veggie Corn dog!!!   The prices are really what makes this place stand out, everything is very reasonable and matches the low key paper trays that all the food comes out on.  They also have a solid beer selection along with a full bar. If the weather is nice you should sit outside on their porch. Parking can be a bit dicey due to the corner it is on, so keep an eye open as you get close."}
{"text":"Met my friends here for our Cheeseburger Friday gathering. You'll want to arrive closer to 11:30 because it starts to get super busy after then and you'll be waiting outside. It is a very small place with a very tiny parking lot (more space down the road) and they will want you to go when you've finished enjoying your burger.  I opted for the double burger with cheddar plus fries. It didn't take too long to arrive. Two large 5 ounce patties with all the toppings on a nice bun. The meat was hot and drippy and delicious. Waffle fries were fresh and hot, soaking up ketchup very nicely.  I chose the $3 beer special, which is a random can or bottle of whatever they want to move quickly. It was a tasty milk stout that I enjoyed.  Our waitress was nice about wanting us to move along - there were at least forty people waiting to get in."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and loved the decorations. I enjoyed the outrageous items on the menu such as the Ding Dong Chicken  (chicken sandwich with slaw, peanut butter and hot sauce). Some of the other items were not as tasty (Patty's melt and popcorn chicken)."}
{"text":"Not a place for the health conscious meal, but very good for comfort food.  menu has a variety of unique items.  Moderately priced and the atmosphere and service was  fine."}
{"text":"Man what!?  Git you life, if you do not fool with Pinky's,,, I get a mammoth waffle fries and maybe a jam session and call it a wrap.  For real tho I haven't tried anything else.     O yeah service is always great.      Thanks,  C."}
{"text":"This place! They have an amazing black bean burger called the Nature Boy that is definitely worth trying and it goes nicely with their waffle fries!"}
{"text":"There is no place to park in their small lot, but other than that I had a great experience. I got an order to go. Vegan: The Nature Boy (no pepper jack cheese, no chipotle mayo, on a gluten-free bun) with a side of Black Eye Pea Salad. Everything was delicious, prepared as requested, ready when I arrived at the specified time, and was a good price."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices!  Lots of interesting flavor combinations and a fun atmosphere with REALLY friendly staff."}
{"text":"Always glad to have another option for dining out in the Huntersville area.  Pinky's did not disappoint.  The shrimp tacos were not as spicy was I expected and really didn't look as filling as I wanted them to.  However, every time I took a bite, it tasted better and better so I cannot complain.  My daughter had the Big John and she was quite pleased with that big sandwich.  She only ate half and she NEVER does that!  The restaurant has a pretty extensive drink menu served at the full bar so I expect it to be busy on weekends and I will have to stay away with the kids.  Service was excellent and we were checked on more than frequently; I could complain about that too but I shall not!  I am giving them 4/5 stars overall because I expected more food for what I paid but it was enough ... go figure. (smh)"}
{"text":"The double cheddar burger with sriracha  sauce was amazing. Very juicy burger. Also had the Pinky Dog. Very tasty chili dog with pimento cheese. Very good flavor!  They have 10 craft beers on tap too."}
{"text":"Pinky's... YUM. What a cool atmosphere - very funky. They are known for their burgers, but I've tried a variety of things there. First, I highly recommend the ginger margarita. If you like ginger, this margar is for you! Cool and refreshing like a margar should be with the perfect hint of ginger. I need one now... but it's snowing.  ANYWAY, they do have really good burgers with unique toppings (ahem, ding dong style). I've ordered the chicken tacos before, which were great. I also love their Camp Green House Salad. They serve high quality greens and offer a variety of house-made, unique dressings.   During my most recent visit, the service was excellent. We had full glasses and everything we needed.   I'm really looking forward to their new porch and I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I recommend anything ding dong style (burger or chicken) and pimpin fries. There's usually a wait so put your name on the list and grab a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"This place is eclectic and fabulous. Orders were veggie burger white trash style (bun doesn't hold up, but that never surprises me), Fish fry, Crab cakes, falafel salad, cheerwine pound cake, banana pudding. few others, but all things ordered got rave reviews. The tahini dressing for the falafel salad was amazing, though the falafel themselves were a little over done. The tartar sauce was incredibly well spiced (reports, I'm allergic to shell fish so after the crab cakes I was out). The banana pudding was the best I've ever tasted. The honey version of cole slaw was incredible and I could not stop stealing someones red potato salad. So much garlic that I didn't know red potato salad needed. I so wanted to get the veggie hot dogs with stuff all over them."}
{"text":"Well, I heard this place was good, but I honestly hated it, so disappointed   The service was great, but felt like they were rushing us to hurry up, you didn't have one waiter, they all were helping all tables, which I thought was a little weird, but anyways. I got a cheeseburger, with fries, got a side of fried pickles. The hamburger wasn't even hot, had no flavor, the bun was falling apart stale, the fries weren't cooked raw. Pickles were good, but greasy ! I'll never go back! I after I left there, I had severe stomach pain, something made me sick?"}
{"text":"My whole family really loved this funky spot (even my parents!) it was featured on Diners, Drive-In's, and Dives TV show!  The decor is funky & divey with fun rock and ska music playing. There's a Giant Triceratops dinosaur out front and a VW bug on top of the building. It was an awesome day so we got to sit outside and enjoy the shaded patio spot.   The wait staff was helpful but all had a stand off-ish rock n roll vibe. Good at they job but not bubbly. I think it kinda fit the atmosphere and they all work together to help your table.   The food was GREAT. There tons of different options - tacos, burgers, hot dogs, salads and we all had a hard time choosing. I love the large number of vegetarian options- even veggie dogs!   My parents loved the hot dog and I loved the buffalo shrimp tacos. The tacos had arugula and Gorgonzola and were so fresh, not too spicy. The sweet potato fries and waffle fries were nice n crispy with great dipping sauces - get BOTH Wasabi Ranch and Honey Mustard!! The famous shrimp corn dogs were tasty - battered whole shrimps with dipping sauce and slaw. Also the black beans side dish BLEW US AWAY. I was not excited about them but the flavor was so dang good we fought over them.   The drink menu is fun and huge- the cocktails all looked strong and tasty. We kept saying we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Pinky's is this little festive dinner on the corner of. The only downside to this place is parking, the lot is tiny. Luckily we came here right after work today and found a spot. Pinky's has its own random quirk which is apparent when you walk in the door, there are so many things to stare at.   My boyfriend and I have been dying to come here so we already knew what we wanted to attack. What really surprised me here, were the prices!! My god it was such a cheap meal and needless to say guilty satisfying too! We ordered the pimp'n fries with vegetarian chili to start...SO GOOD. The pimento cheese really made this app, the chili though is not as flavorful as the Chili Man's vegan chili (hollaaa!) I couldn't get enough and they were huge...I was basically full before even ordering the entree.   I got the corn dog jumbo shrimp while my bf ordered the white trash style chicken sandwich. I wish I would have replaced the fries my entree came with for something else like the black eyed pea salad..I can't believe I'm saying this, but I was all fryed out...ME..fryed out. Pinky's accomplished that. The corn dog shrimp themselves were AMAZING..the corn dog batter was almost sweet and cooked to a perfect crunch. The shrimp was huge and juicy. The buckets also come with amazing and flavorful  dipping sauces, they are huge. I got the spicy ranch, nomz, creamy deliciousness. The coleslaw that came with the chicken sandwich was really good too, I'm not a fan of coleslaw normally. Had minimal mayonnaise and I could feel the texture and taste the cabbage and other veggies. We waddled out of there  Our servers were great! Very nice and attentive. Banana pudding, we are coming back for you. And basically everything else. They have great drink specials too, Tuesdays are $2.50 drafts. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Pimpin' fries with veggie chili. (Thanks, Tonya P. for the recommendation. Total game changer.)  Fried pickles.  Vegetarian hot dogs.  Nature boy, ding dong style.  Tall, cool, cheap cans of PBR.  There's not a better place for you to enjoy heartburn-inducing food. Despite the lack of parking spaces and the not-so-enthusiastic service, it's a go-to for me. I would eat here once a week if my jeans didn't protest so loudly.  Great place for kids, or just grabbing dinner and beer with friends."}
{"text":"I've been here with my family a handful of times. We don't typically wait long for a table. The food is usually pretty good. Prices are decent too. We don't usually have that great of an experience with the service though. A bar drink is ordered and it never arrives. Something that was ordered gets a bit messed up or it takes awhile to get the food. We still enjoy the meal, it's just not crazy awesome or anything."}
{"text":"So I'm a burger-head...They're great at Pinky's.  Never had any issues with the wait-staff (uniformly friendly and efficient)...Grew up in Westside Charlotte, so this is like going back home--with dishes named after my old junior high school (Herbert Spaugh) and my old street (Camp Greene)...How can one beat that?  Very respectable beer selection and relaxed, old-style diner decor...One caveat (certainly not a problem for me!)...If one feels uncomfortable around lots of very creative tattoos--don't go Westside!  (Like I said:  feels like home to me!)"}
{"text":"Try to make it here at least once a month.  If you are new to, or have friends coming to Charlotte for the first time you have to stop!  I haven't been disappointed with a single meal here.  The best grease gourmet in charlotte"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with pimento cheese fries and a nice cold local brew? Everything I've glad here have been excellent!"}
{"text":"So I've been here twice since my move to NC. I originally tastes and enjoyed the 'old\" Penguin and heard of the transformations... So Pinky's I headed... And not to mention my father gave me the nickname Pinky since I was born.   The first visit I was starving and seeking grease to satisfy my belly. I was visiting from San Diego making my mind up whether or not to move the QC. San Diego doesn't have fried pickles and other greasy yummy morsels.   So I ordered the hush puppies, pimento cheese burger, regular coleslaw and fries... yes it was a major pig out... but I knew I'd have left overs to share later.   I really, really enjoyed that first meal...I mean really. I also had a beer and it all only come to $17 and then plus tip.   Okay... so then I return with my folks about two weeks later... and was really let down. The hamburger meat wasn't seasoned, the fries tasted like they had been double fried... the hush puppies... meh. And I know it's not a place to take my mom back to when she starts to 'play\" with her food... Moms (who we call Snoopy) is an incredible, if not outstanding cook... I mean absolutely amazing -- I won't even cook for her because I never want to see her \"playing\" with the food I made. So that is a sign too.... inconsistency seems to be a problem plagued with so many restaurants.    Not sure if I will go back... but who knows. When my sister comes down from NYC I'm sure we will go-- she's the one that originally turned us on to Penguin YEARS ago... She loves them fried pickles - me not so much as I find them salty... but that's just me. And she loves the vegetarian items...."}
{"text":"I stopped here for the first time from a friend's recommendation. The ambiance is very laid back. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I had a fried bologna sandwich which was amazing! I will definitely be back. Don't be discouraged by the front parking lot. There is more parking in the rear."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a corn dog, (based on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives) was in a rush to get to the airport.  Next time I am in the area I hope to enjoy a full meal.  Corn dog was good.  [Update 7/17/2017] My third time here.  This time, I had to try \"Ding Dong Style\" - it did not disappoint!  A wild combo but it really works on the burger, which was cooked to perfection.  I also tried the fried pickle chips, I was not overly impressed as they were very salty.  They were good, but I wouldn't order them again.  The picture is the \"small\" on the menu - which is huge, but just too much for me to enjoy/eat.  Overall, this place hasn't disappointed in the three times I've been here."}
{"text":"This is a Charlotte staple. If you haven't been--GO! The food is super good and unbelievably underpriced for the quality, there are always cheap drink specials on the full bar and the service is fantastic.  Do expect a wait during the busier times, they will not seat you until your full party is there. Trust me, the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Went here on a business trip with my husband, after we saw that Guy liked it we had to try it out :).  I had the special Blackened Chicken Tacos and he had the Tetradactyl Burger and a homemade corn dog! Everything tasted great!! My husband said the burger could have been less cooked but it still tasted good! After we had to sample the banana pudding! It was so good! Couldn't finish cause I was stuffed.  Their unsweetened tea tasted fresh too! We will come again someday, we travel a lot!"}
{"text":"This place has been on our radar for about a year now. Finally we stopped in before heading to the airport to catch a flight. Immediately I wish that I had come here in a cab as they offered a variety of delicious sounding alcoholic beverages. My girlfriend and I were in and out of this place in about a half hour, which was a plus seeing that we had to catch a flight. The service was great and the food was pretty good for the type of grub they were serving.  It is hard to give an accurate review of this place on the first try seeing that we only tried their wraps and hush puppies (very good...but of course who can screw up hush puppies?). There was nothing really memorable about this place, but we will definitely be back to check-out the drinks and other food items.  Lastly, I'm not quite sure if this place knows exactly what type of establishment they are. I would love to see them in the south end side of town and open until 2:00a.m. I would also recommend this place have one side as the eating joint and the other side a bar, since it does seem to be a bit confused what kind of crowd they are looking for. Overall a \"B\" grade for PINKY'S!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, and it did not disappoint. My wife had the short rib tacos, delicious. I had the Reuben hot dog, aw,esoteric. The best item was the huspuppies stuffed with crab meat. Prices great along with the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very cool funky style atmosphere! Delicious food, full bar and televisions. A great family style place - I saw one kid with a corn dog, no joke - bigger that his head - over a foot long!!  Everything comes in paper trays; big menu list; they have a HUGE margarita and shots list; they offer outdoor seating too!  Best Tip about this place: their menu is vegetarian friendly"}
{"text":"Great burgers. Relaxed atmosphere & good prices. The staff was really nice , it's pretty kid friendly.  A lot of interesting drink choices and I really liked the music & the decorations made it different from other burger places. I would like to go back . :-D"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to be the Debbie Downer here, but Pinky's was just very overwhelming in atmosphere and underwhelming in food. It was not only recommended by Yelpers but a good friend who is a Charlotte native.   Starting with the parking lot, the experience was frustrating at times. The lot is TINY and cramped and if you aren't a local and don't know all the good side streets, you can feel a little lost trying to park. The bright spot was walking in: there's a super fun photo booth that is a cheap and interesting way to pass some time while waiting for food. The eclectic beer list should please pretty much anyone. The service was a little lacking for me. I understand I came with a pretty straight-laced party with kids, but the young hipster that served us seemed pretty unnecessarily annoyed by having to serve us. He wasn't rude or slow, just seemed to have a permanent scowl and seemed \"above it all\". I started looking around for signs that the restaurant's \"schtick\" was overly-bored staff. It was also SUPER loud...not a great atmosphere for a family meal or book club, or even people that want to hear themselves talk. Great for a party of loud rambunctious people, though.  The food was really the disappointing part to me. After seeing the DDD episode I was excited for innovative food and tried the veggie burger. Um...there was SO MUCH GREASE that my bun was pretty much useless. Between the fried appetizer and \"veggie\" burger, I used so many napkins that I was probably the reason our server was annoyed. My parents seemed pretty lackluster about their burgers, too. I expect that from my dad, who hates restaurants, but my mom is usually pretty easy going and she didn't have much to say about her food. Or if she did, I couldn't hear it. My hubs liked whatever he got, I'm pretty sure it was a sandwich with a rare tuna steak. So there's a food bright spot.  All in all, we don't visit Charlotte very often but there will definitely be other places I want to try rather than returning to Pinky's."}
{"text":"Dope food. Unreal value. Low prices for sure. Burger was on. Crab hush puppies were awesome. Will def hit it up next time in town."}
{"text":"Before going I gave them a call and got my name on the list. They had a table ready (even though there was a crowd) when we arrived. The pimiento cheese fries were incredible. They alone are worth the trip here. Equally good are the Crab puppies, sweet potato fries and burgers. I think it may even be better than the Penguin!"}
{"text":"Want a unhealthy amazing meal?! This is it!! We love it fries are great. Burgers are great and so is fried chicken. I love going there and looked forward to another amazing meal"}
{"text":"We ordered the Crab Puppies as an appetizer, they were a little odd, but the tarter sauce they were served with was amazing. The burger was very good. Our service was somewhat slow. It was hard to know who was our actual server as they all kind of tagged teamed the outside tables. I wasn't a real fan of that."}
{"text":"Really cool vibe that's fun to be around. You'll never leave hungry as most options are full of flavor and generally pretty heavy. The fried pickles, pimento cheese fries are great appetizers. The white trash burger is also a solid go to"}
{"text":"Best burger (The Mammoth) I have had since I moved to North Carolina! I'll be back for the crab/cornbread hush puppies and the $5 cocktails. I want to try the vegetarian and vegan options on my next trip! I brought my girlfriends here after we left a CIAA event this weekend. I recently moved to Gastonia and I try to hit a new local place every week or so. Found Pinky's on Yelp and it was a great recommendation! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food. Highly recommend the white trash burger. Well priced and nice outdoor patio area. Def will be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food. For those that love pimento cheese like I do, you definitely need to go!"}
{"text":"Great things were said about this small quirky moms and pops style diner. I have bypassed this place for years and never thought not even once to step foot in.Yesterday myself and some friends wen't here for a quick bite to eat for lunch. The menu itself was very interesting catchy and funny style names of the burgers and meals,as well everything was super cheap. I was going to be extra and order the nature boy just because im a fan of the great Rick Flair. But instead i ordered the ding dong chicken which i was a little skeptical of ordering when i noticed a crunchy peanut butter spread present on the sandwich, but then i said to myself what the hay YOLO (you only live once) and decided i was going to take a chance if i die i die! To my surprise the burger was tasty and not at all what i was expecting and it was a nice touch with the honey cilantro slaw. My friends ordered the white trash burger, fried squash, and the highly recommended corn dog shrimp with waffle fries. Of coarse i had to taste test their food since this was  my first time and they both been before. Everything was definitely very consistent and up to par in my opinion. If you just want a cheat day and just want something out of control good with everything you can imagine,well Pinky's is the place to be.Oh how can i forget that banana pudding all i going to say is its sinful you don't want to visit and not get any point,blank,period."}
{"text":"Bah humbug, here comes the Grinch. I hate to always rain on the parade, but Public Enemy said it best; \"Don't believe the hype\"! I wasn't caught up in the allure of what happened with the whole \"Happy Feet\" fiasco. So I'm judging it for what it is; unadulterated and raw.  Pinky's is a fine example of what happens with a clone or franchise. It's never as good as the original. I live across the street, but Pinky's is not the neighborhood locale. I love the decor, appreciate how they restored the original building, love the ambiance, hip crowd, pin up, rockabilly style that the employees rock but that's about as far as it goes.   Good beer selection with great prices don't get me wrong, but as far as food, just your average run of the mill bar. The best item I had was the pimp'n pimento fries. The chicken wings were nothing special, a little soggy actually. While they were very meaty, they weren't the least bit crispy. The fish tacos were even worse, a little too fishy tasting.   In a nutshell, Pinky's is a really cool spot to hang out at though. A good place to grab a drink, but not necessarily a prime spot to grab some grub. I guess that might be why it's classified as a diner on Yelp. Definitely worth checking out though. They really do have some unique menu items that will appeal to almost everyone."}
{"text":"A good hang out place with a character. The portions are great and for good price. The food was great. I had loaded chili fries and it was yummy. Staff was very friend, really felt like a good tean"}
{"text":"This place could have 5 star rating from me, the only reason it doesn't its because of some disgruntle employees that unfortunately still work there. Anyways, the food its great, and if you don't get to order the fried pickles or the sweet potatoes chips or the pimp'n fries you are not  fully enjoying the place.   On a side note, they have 2 locations. Their location in Uptown(Downtown) its usually crowded and maybe that is why some of the staff is less friendly. But good news!, their second location with the same food and better service, plus is less crowded. Is just a bit off north (i77 exit 23). Go there and enjoy it."}
{"text":"I am definitely a pinky's loyalist to the original location. But this one is by far the better of the two. More space, the servers are extremely attentive and the food comes out so quickly. I ordered the Shirley temple for the first time and it was to die for! It's a great location to go to if you have children they give the kids chalk to draw outside. I'm really glad we tried this place!"}
{"text":"Great burgers...never leave disappointed. Went the other night had a great burger and the fries pickles were awesome.....I love the fact that you never see the same server twice during your meal....it's like server roulette.....always my go to place for a good burger."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I would eat at Pinkys any day over any meal. Hands Down, our favorite Bar in Charlotte. We have been visiting for a few years now. Our favorite is the White trash burger with Pimpin fries with the chili and cheese. Ohhh my goshh, I send people to Pinkys all the time! Thank you guys at Pinkys for your awesome service as well!! If you go to Pinkys West Side Grill, don't forget to order the Bannana pudding. ((:"}
{"text":"I used to go there for lunch all the time and get the Tahini Salad! Recently I visited after a long hiatus and relieved my taste buds as it always had!! Would love to try other items on the menu, but would hate to be steered away from the lovely tastes of my go to!! Customer service is great too, I've never had a problem there."}
{"text":"Great relaxed place to have a drink and a quick meal. I split a plate of fries with a friend and had a very well made vodka soda. We also tried the Girl Scout cookie cake which was to die for! It tasted exactly like a Samoa! The bartenders were all very nice and made is some Girl Scout themed shots which were tasty. I'll definitely be back to try their food, everything looked so good. Can't beat the prices either."}
{"text":"My friends just got a job at Panthers stadium and suggested we grab a quick bite. The diner had great character. It wasn't too big or too small. We both got the buffalo chicken fingers and as much dipping sauce as we wanted. My meal wasn't the most interesting thing on the menu, but it hit the spot!. The service was one of the best parts! I think we had three different waiters follow up with us throughout the meal. Next time I'm going to be a little bit more adventurous and get fried pickles!"}
{"text":"Awesome is an understatement! Loved this place! I took my family of 8 and they all enjoyed it. Great appetizers as well as entrees."}
{"text":"White trash burger was awesome, got take out and it was super quick! Can't wait to order from there again"}
{"text":"Great spot, great food. Tried this local spot while visiting Charlotte and I would definitely come here regularly if I lived in the area. The food is served HOT & fast. The entire staff serves you instead just waiting on one server. The atmosphere, music etc. is cool & chill."}
{"text":"Pinky's is a neat burger joint (they also have salads, hot dogs, and sandwiches for those of you that don't want a burger).   I went with my roommate and we started with the crab puppies appetizer which is basically a hush puppy with crab meat in them. The serving was pretty big - probably about 15 puppies and they were delicious. The dip they serve them with is great.   We both got the white trash burger which is a cheeseburger topped with fried pickles, onion straws, and a spicy ranch - 3 of my favorite things. It did not disappoint! My only critique is that they serve it on a regular old bun like you would buy at the grocery store. When I get a burger at a restaurant I would rather have it be on a really delicious bun - not one of the 8pack buns for a dollar.   We also order an order of the onion rings and waffle fries to split. The waffle fries were good. The onion rings were TERRIBLE. They are more like onion strings that weren't crispy and were greasy. I would not recommend anyone to order the onion rings.   They have a decent drink/cocktail menu and the prices are cheap! Great place to grab a drink.   Everything they serve to you is on plastic or paper (except drinks). We didn't even get any silverware. We didn't really need it, but it was strange not to have any silverware when you're dining at a restaurant.   They have a little mini arcade type area by the host/hostess stand great for kids. The decor is neat with an eclectic mix of different types of memorabilia."}
{"text":"Yummy food, not necessarily healthy, but great tasting!  Fried pickles are on point!"}
{"text":"This is a place that knows what it is and does it the right way.  I've been here a few times, and every visit has been true to the following principles.  1) Food cooked to perfection. 2) Quick and attentive staff, from host to server to bartender, nobody leaves you hanging. 3) Clean location, quality, and a genuinely friendly staff.  If you find yourself in the uptown area, this is a no-brainer for a great lunch/dinner whatever.  My recommendations: White Trash Burger, Pickle Chips, Da Pimp, or if you are feeling extra southern - a double westside style (Chili, slaw, mustard, add cheese, boom goes the dynamite).  I'll be back time and time again."}
{"text":"It's just a pretty awesome place. Really cool vibe, waitstaff is awesome, food was really good to. Nice to go to a restaurant that has vegetarian stuff too ! Good portion size on everything Yeah I'm a big fan I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"What a fun place with good ol fashion \"junk\" food, but the taste was fantastic.   We got some fantastic deep fried crab puppies.  They were full of crab and they came with some fantastic tartar sauce.  Another appetizer we got, which was the best thing we got was the Pimp'n Fries.  One of the best things I have ever have.  Waffle fries drenched in a pimento cheese mix.  Just fantastic.  Worth the calories and guilt when they are gone.  Get them!!!  We had burgers, chili dogs and a salad.  They were above average.  Not the best ever but good.  This place is legit because of all the comfort food options and the price is so cheap.  What a reasonable price for great food and beer.  The happy hour specials which are always going are fantastic.  This place will become a regular for me. Go and indulge !"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a semi-grungy (but in a cool dive-y way, not dirty) place to eat on the Westside of Charlotte, Pinky's Westside Grill is the way to go. Owned by one of the former owners of The Penguin during that restaurant's renaissance, what was supposed to become The Penguin 2 ended up changing it's name to Pinky's but still featuring the same great burgers, chili, sandwiches and other great items. Little portions on big plates does not happen here. Here, you get more than you can eat at a very fair price, whether it's burgers, sandwiches or anything else they serve. For your health's sake, you may want to make it a treat instead of a staple, but it's still some of the best food in Charlotte and possibly some of the best burgers in the area!"}
{"text":"Yay for fried pickles, the veggie burgers and beer selection. Cool setting"}
{"text":"Had a great burger, chips and peach margherita there yesterday! Would highly recommend for lunch."}
{"text":"Slam Dunk!! It's our version of Hodads(a San Diego CA Historic eatery) in the South. The service was up to par. The price point did not cause sticker shock. I had the Triple G my boss had the Jive turkey. We also the banana pudding. This place earned a 5 Star ya, man from us. We will be back to haunt this place. The ONLY bummer is parking, but it is what it is...."}
{"text":"So I lived in Charlotte for about 5 years during my years of undergrad and never ate at Pinky's - biggest mistake EVER! This place is amazing! When walking in, it's eclectic and a little wild but clean and cute. The restaurant isn't that big and fills up fast so you might need to call ahead or get there before the dinner rush. The prices are extremely reasonable and the flavors that come with the food with knock your tastebuds out of this world! The crab puppies are a must !!!!! The crab puppies will make you feel like your are sitting on the Maryland Harbor living it up! It is filled, i mean really really filled, with sweet crab meat that they don't hold back on. The puppies are big and just amazing! And the homemade tartar sauce is out of this world. Finally- the grilled chicken salad with crispy onions is MORE THAN AMAZING it is more than OUT OF THIS WORLD, it is heaven sent!!!!!! Although there is more chicken and onions than salad it's just too good to care! I would recommend, unless you really truly honestly love onions to leave the red onions out because the fried onions do a great job. Oh and the HOMEMADE RANCHHH! A true Southern just has a special place in their heart for well done homemade ranch and this one takes the cake. Overall, this is place you must stop and try and take extra socks because the food here will knock them off! Easily! Quickly! Truly and Honestly!"}
{"text":"This is always going to be my late-night go to spot. The food always arrives fast and whenever I get in a mood for a corndog... I can order as many as I want without judgement!   AND the Banana Pudding will have you checking the kitchen for your grandma/auntie!! Lol"}
{"text":"Decent food and very, very inexpensive.  What's not to like about that combo?  My wife got a Reuben Dog and I had a grilled chicken sandwich.  It's hard to mess up a hot dog and the toppings on this one were good so, on to the chicken.  A not all that thick boneless breast that had a nice sear and was still moist.  It was served on a soft sesame seed bun with fresh lettuce, swiss cheese, a good amount of bacon and some honey mustard sauce.  It was good and, again, it was cheap.  The service was friendly and my only complaint would be the tiny little paper baskets the food gets served in.  Sometimes hard to get in there and pick the sandwich up.  Oh yeah, I loved the Southern Slaw!   Overall, a nice addition to the LKN area."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend's new favorite spot. He can't stop. And he wouldn't if he didn't have some adult supervision. (he almost ordered delivery through foodie call aka he was willing to eat the $20 delivery cost, as we live in university nowhere near either location.) The fried pickles are some of the best we've ever had. The ranch dip is exceptional, and usually ranch makes me gag.  Burger meat is soooo juicy, so delicious, so so good.  Waffle fries are basically Chick fil a's. I could live on them.  Sweet potato fries are satisfying.  Don't order the onion rings, unless you're interested in eating a pound of those weird crunchy onion straw things that go on top of green bean cassarole (not saying I've never done that) Corn dogs. What an underappreciated piece of heaven on a stick. My favorite.  We love the Craft beer roulet. They basically stick their hand in an ice bucket and for $3, you get whatever beer they pull out. Great way to venture out of your comfort zone.  Just come check it out."}
{"text":"Can't say I was all that impressed with the food. Based on the reviews, I was expecting something completely different. We started with the fried pickles. I don't think I've ever had a fried pickle I didn't like, until today. They had a smoky flavor...not sure if it was the batter but it was probably the worst I've had. I got the white trash burger and it lived up to the name. Just a mediocre burger. Not a whole lot of flavor. The waffle fries were decent but better at Chick-Fil-A. For the price, what you get is okay but I would rather spend more money and get something delicious. I really wanted to like this place but at the end of the day, I just don't. We won't be recommending Pinky's or returning."}
{"text":"It was a nice place in the middle of almost no where. Freedom dr doesn't have many places to sit and eat. The music was loud and the place itself was different. Not in a bad way at all. The food was good too. Very different and yummy. The serves could of been better. But I did go on a Saturday night when it was super busy. Their parking sucks. Very limited. You have to park across the street or behind the place itself. I would go again. Probably if I was in the area. I wouldn't make it a point to just drive there tho."}
