{"text":"A nice view of the lake and music at times.  Remember why you are going there and in particular why you are sitting at an outside table.  The atmosphere is great any time of the day or night.  The food, as you would expect, is fair to good and, as always, service is optional."}
{"text":"When they day 9pm, they mean 9pm. Pizza was a 2 stars - nothing special. Wings were too salty. Beer was the only part that made it worthwhile - dark IPA."}
{"text":"nice outdoor seating.  tasty sangria.  nice service although the bartender decided to have a discussion with someone when we were ready to settle up and move to a table.  Had the chicken alfredo.  Sauce was very nice but the chicken was so so.  The wife had spagetti and meatballs which was good too.  Worth the visit.  Your kids can play on the grass or playground while you wait for food etc."}
{"text":"We decided to stop for breakfast there this morning as we had just taken a run around the fountain. The breakfast menu was nothing to exciting and reminded me of something you'd get at a diner. So after waiting more then a half hour (more like 45 mins although the waitress said it was only 30 mins), and being told numerous times our food was coming out, it was then delivered incorrectly and they needed to start it all over again. We paid for our coffee and OJ and left. Definitely will not be going back!"}
{"text":"The pizza without sauce was fantastic. I believe it was the margarita but I honestly don't remember the name. The ingredients were very fresh. We also shared a tortellini salad. I was very surprised that it was a pasta salad and not a veggie salad. It has a poppy seed dressing and is served cold. I would personally add prosciutto or more cheese in the salad, but overall I was impressed. Very creative, and I will try it again. Oh and it has an amazing view of the fountain, but the service was slow and not attentive."}
{"text":"An eatery that deserves more praise than there is room or words for.   The atmosphere was quiet even on a busy weekend evening.  The wait staff was attentive and timely.      The food was outstanding.  I personnally had the Seafood Spendour, and it was definitely the best dining experience I have had in quite a while.  The freshly baked rolls were right from the oven and put those from the corporate chain restruants to shame.    Pricing was definitely reasonable.  Will definitely be dining here again."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I'd go here constantly if I could afford to. The calzones taste delicious, as does the pizza. The garlic knots are also delicious - basically anything that has bread involved! From what I understand, all the bread is made in house, and it definitely tastes that way. The marinara sauce is also good, and pairs well with any bread you want to dip in it! The owner is also a really great woman. I recommend Euro whole-heartedly!"}
{"text":"We recently went to Euro Pizza Cafe for lunch.  I had the special which was a catfish sandwich with fries.  This sandwich was five stars.  We typically order the calzone which is so large we split it.  On nice days sit out side, they have a great patio overlooking the fountain.  This is a nice restaurant with good service and a great location.  We have eaten here many times both for lunch and dinner and the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Ok, maybe 3 1/2 stars but my overall eating experience at Euro Pizza Cafe was pretty good and I would go again.  It definately surpassed my expectations which weren't very high.  I was expecting another anonymous suburban over-priced and bland Italian eatery but what I found was much to the contrary.  The environment was nicely decorated (as much can be expected in a typical sprawl mall building)and had a pleasant ambiance.  There were the ubiquitous distracting  televisions but I only noticed two placed over the bar.  The seating area was a little underlit for my tastes but the interior decorations were tasteful and helped to give the place some character.  The outdoor seating area in the back is shaded (facing east) and has to be one of the premier outdoor seating areas in the valley.  Its sleepy and quiet and sits right on the grassy, central lagoon in Fountain Hills.  You can watch the fountain shoot off every hour and people-watch and the four peaks provide the backdrop!  The service for a busy friday night was very respectable and my waitress was attentive and helpful.  The menu contained pastas, pizzas, calzones, and some seafood dishes.  Alcohol is served here and they have beer on tap.  I had the baked fish (tilapia) over steamed vegetables.  I was expecting an over breaded too thin slice of tilapia with the steamed vegetables you might get at Applebees or other box restaurants.  What I got; surprised and satisfied me; a good cut of fish reasonably breaded on an assortment of stir-fried/steamed veggies that were crunchy and good.  There was also a lemon reduction sauce on the fish which I found to be tasty.  An added bonus to the meal were the reasonable prices which is tough to say in this over-priced, ethnically homogenous and mediocre culinary scene that exists in Scottsdale/Fountain Hills area.  They could easily add $5 to everything on their menu just for the view of the fountain and four peaks.  In all, the ambiance (especially if your outdoors) is great, the food is good (even admitting I'm not a big Italian cuisine fan), and the prices are very reasonable (meal + beer + tip = just over $20).  A pizza could be shared between two with some soft drinks for the same price.  Again, I've become a bit of a cynic about the mid range culinary options in this area and walked a way from Euro Pizza Cafe feeling completely satisfied with the overall eating experience and the attitude that I would definately return sometime.  I recommend it; good for solo, family or a date!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent (Greek salad was awesome) Great patio seating. Service can be hit or miss but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this cafe for years, and it never disappoints. The food is homecooked fresh, European quality.  I highly recommend the Chicken pasta dishes, especially the Chicken Pesto. To die for! Also try anything with their Tzaziki (sp? sauce....the best I've ever had) The wide open view of Fountain Lake makes this both elegant and relaxing.  The wait staff knows how to handle children, and the service is appropriately paced for a cafe in America.  However, the owners are European, and they ensure a relaxed, not rushed dining experience, so plan on relaxing when you go here.  Finally, the owners oversee everything themselves; they are not absentee owners, and of course this makes a big difference."}
{"text":"If you want to pay $12 for 5 small muscles, be sure to eat here. The only reason this place stays open is because people from out of town are willing to suffer lousy food in order to look at the fountain while they eat."}
{"text":"Has gone downhill in terms of food quality and service. Waiter did not know the specials and made repeated mistakes but was not new. The waiter stated that they never had served scallops yet scallops are on the menu.   DINING IN FOUNTAIN HILLS SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Good food, crappy service, inflated prices not worth it.  Loved my Italian sandwich, very tasty. Pizza was yum too. But the service is lacking and the cost is higher than it should be.  Would return, but won't be a regular."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went here with my family an I ordered a gyro. The pita bread was more like calzone bread, barely any sauce, 2 tomatoes, and disgusting red onion. I asked the waiter to take it off the bill, which he did, but he gave me major attitude. If I had not been with my grandparents I would have probably got in a verbal altertcation with him. But I guess I have to feel bad for the kid, being a waiter in fountain hills. Anyways stay clear of this place."}
{"text":"Great gathering place. Plenty of friendly help and the best summer Happy Hour in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Poor service. My food was cold and the waitress just shrugged. ..never again...poor! !!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Both chicken dishes were good. 1 was a \"Dr Oz\" and the other was the chx dish just below the \"Oz\" on the menu...can't recall name. Good atmosphere, especially after the re-design ...good job.  Dan"}
{"text":"Love sitting outside with nice view of fountain. Food is great and have never been disappointed. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love Euro Pizza.  Their Dr. Oz Veggies are so good.  We've also had pizza which is great too.  They have indoor/outdoor seating which is great.  Also the best view of the fountain on the patio.  When very busy we have had a slight delay in getting served but then have received food very timely.  Would recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"First time I've tried this place and it was the worst service experience I've ever had. I ordered spanakopita and an iced tea- 15 mins to get my iced tea and even longer to get my food. When I finally got my food it was cold and gross. Highly disappointed in this place. The manager walked by me numerous times and didn't even bother to inquire why I didn't have my drink yet or my food, other servers were walking by and I could tell by the expression on their face that they knew I was getting bad service. No one bothered. To give you an idea of how long this took, people came in 10 mins after me and ordered an entire pizza ... Got their pizza before I got three slices of spanakopita. WTF?! awful service, awful management, and the food was not good. If only I could give minus stars, then would it be accurate."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for quite some time and was here on Tuesday of this week. This may very well be my last time eating here. We were seated at a table on the patio and it was, well, quite frankly, filthy. The patio was filthy. It was littered with crumpled up used napkins, straw holders, you name it. The oilcloth tablecloth on our table was so sticky I had to spread a napkin on the table in front of me so that my glass and silverware didn't stick to the tablecloth. Our server, at our request, wiped the table off but it didn't help. As always, the food was good and our server was friendly, but it and, even the view of the fountain, didn't make up for the appalling conditions. They need to buy new tablecloths for all of the outdoor tables and they need to power wash their patio. There is simply no excuse for these conditions. So, Euro Pizza Cafe, it's up to you. BTW, I don't live in Fountain Hills but I have friends who do, and I have spread the word about conditions at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Casual dining with great drinks, food, pizza and service! The 2 times I sat on the patio were beautiful experiences and I don't hesitate to take out of town friends here."}
{"text":"Luv this place ! They changed the menu~ miss the Cobb salad. Who would of thought?!? The breakfast is sooo good even though it is an italian restaurant. Great patio over looking the fountain."}
{"text":"I couldn't belive this experience.  I asked a couple of times how long the wait would be for the patio.  The staff would not provide even an estimate and just kept trying to seat us inside.  After a couple of mins we told them we would leave and come back another time and the staff said that we were just being impatient.  Maybe it was just an off day but I was very surprised by the attitude."}
{"text":"Came here after playing some disc golf...This place has the best calzones!!!  Their pizza is good also, but gotta go for the calzones!  You really get your monies worth for $8.  Their draft rootbeer is good, but you could taste a bit of a beer aftertaste.  Love the scenery with outdoor seating...looking at the fountain and green landscaping is so relaxing!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service consistently below average and sometimes very poor.  Pizza is a little pricey.  Sitting on their patio in the good Arizona weather is fantastic."}
{"text":"We've been to Fountail Hills a handful of times and decided that we would eat at one of their local restaurants this time. It was between this and the All American Sports Grill, but we were really in the mood for pizza.  We requested a table outside but due to reservations, there were none left, so we asked for a table inside but near the patio. We were a party of four and had four drinks and a large specialty pizza. If you ask my opinion, it was too overpriced for the eight slices we got. The pizza had these round sliced sausages which were absolutely horrible . But overall it was ok.  Our server was friendly and attentive, and she took good care of us. About three minutes after our food was served, this waitress who was not ours hovers above our table, stares at each of our plates one by one, and asks if we're still working on our food. I don't know if she thought we were finished (even thought we barely touched the pizza because it was too hot) or if she needed the table (which doesn't make sense because there was only us and one other family inside the restaurant and we had arrived at the same time) but overall it was impolite. The manager asked the other family how the food was but didn't bother asking us. I cannot stress enough how dissatisfied I was with the service, but if you're set on eating pizza, then go right ahead."}
{"text":"I love this place. You would think because it's kind of a sports bar that it would just have your average sports bar quality food. Not so. The Greek salad with gyro meat is amazing. And all my coworkers loved their dishes last time we were here, too. Not to mention the wait staff is...how are the kids saying it these days... On fleek?"}
{"text":"There is something for everyone on the menu. It's more than pizza. The service is great. Get a table on the terrace and you get the view of the park and fountain. I will keep going back."}
{"text":"Our visit to Scottsdale brought us into Fountain Hills to look for a home. While we were there we decided to look at the beautiful fountain we heard so much about. That's when we happened upon this place. The pizza was fantastic!!! It made us want to move here even more. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting , but consistently underwhelming service.. Cold food tonight and had to order 2 nd round of wine at the bar because my waited was missing in action ... Last time I escalate to the manager and have a ruined evening   Just because it's fountain hills doesn't mean you should not expect Scottsdale service .. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service needs improvement.  We were given 2 napkins for 6 people and had to go find the server to get the check."}
{"text":"Um, YUM! We got the garden salad - very fresh. We also got the pizza with avocado, olives, etc. VERY good. The dough is soooo yummy and you can tell they just made it. The toppings were perfect. EAT HERE."}
{"text":"After eating out in AZ for 6 days I believe this was our favorite meal.   Dr Oz's Veggies with Gyro meat was good and a huge portion.   The classic pizza might be the best pizza we have EVER had.  Kids meals were fine but their fries were spectacular.  Love the view of the fountain."}
{"text":"Solid place...not fantastic or anything to write home about......But with the views of the fountain and a nice patio it's your best option for the location right on the park....but there are better places to eat in FH."}
{"text":"Very fishy oily taste, bad  As a vegetarian since 1989 and totally sold out to organic and non-GMO food, I am completely dissatisfied with my meal tonight. The eggplant parm tasted greasy and fishy. I asked if seperate fryers were used for veggie vs animal flesh foods and server said yes. They re-made my dish but still fishy. This restaurant is a gold mine in our tiny town.  They need to do much better with food quality. I have brought up the vegetarian issue multiple times with the servers over many years. It seems to fall on deaf ears. I have had it. Stomach queasy. Don't want to go back. I have given good reviews in the past but my patience has ended."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast after a walk around the fountain. Beautiful views and food is consistently good. They accommodate large groups and offer separate checks. Nice community restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant many times.  We often take out of state visitors to this restaurant because of the beautiful view of the fountain. Unfortunately the service is usually poor. The food is slow arriving and the server does not follow up after the food is delivered, (asking is everything OK and tasty). The outdoor patio seating deserves a much higher rating than 2 stars maybe 4 1/2 stars but the service is less than one star.  On my last experience not only was the service slow, but the server was unfriendly and seemed rushed and disturbed when we asked for water. Nice place to sit outside on a beautiful AZ day but not a great service or food experience."}
{"text":"And this is what we get stuck with in Fountain Hills, huh? Don't waste your time.  You're better off bringing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and sit in the grass at 125 degrees."}
{"text":"Came here to give it a second try. Left after 10 minutes after not being served. No one came by to even take a drink order. This was our second visit with poor service."}
{"text":"In town to see family and stopped here to eat. Food was wonderful and the atmosphere inviting. We love the remodel that occurred.  My wife and son had the \"Via Bianca\" pizza with salads which was all delicious. The crust was excellent. Read previous reviews where some people didn't care for it. I don't know what they were referring to, ours was perfect. Some people you just can't please.  I had the Chicken \"Royale\" which was tasty and I highly recommend! Fresh garlic knots hot out of the oven and a European dessert menu, what's not to love!!!  I would recommend stopping by for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sit on the patio and watch the fountain that goes off at the top of every hour.  Kudos to the staff for a delightful experience!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Nice local place to grab a good meal and look out at the fountain and mountains. Meal selections quiet reasonable. Coffee just slightly higher than expected. Had their breakfast sandwich which had bacon, ham onons, egg and cheese on toast. Very big with a side of American fries. Will be back."}
{"text":"Do not get the salad here. I paid $10 for a salad that was the size and quality of a side salad. My friends all really enjoyed their meals though so it's not all bad. Just terrible salad."}
{"text":"A long time favorite of mine. Euro pizza has a great menu with plent of healthy options. I sometimes bring a good book and sit on the terrance and get lost for a while. The bar and restraunt is newly remodled and is beautfuil. Great food and view. Ask for Tommy at the bar."}
{"text":"I gave two for the fountain view , food was horrid, salad wilted lettuce which was brown on edges , waitress recommended Mediterranean grilled vegetables ,added chicken ,dry tasteless broccoli Us yellowed , so disappointed. Service was good ,food horrid again."}
{"text":"We went here for pizza last night and I witnessed someone in authority \"chewing out\" a waitress accordiing to her body  language. It was visable to all and I felt for the young waitress from  Albania. (She was our waitress) who was embarrassed I am sure and humiliated. I stopped by the desk and told the person who was responsible that when she \"chewed out:\" a staff person..she needed to take it out of the restaurant. She smiled and said thank you. It maybe a while befoe I return...if I do. This person should have realized long ago this is  no way to treat anyone!! Pizza was ok.."}
{"text":"Thank you Euro Pizza for being an awesome place to eat. This is our go to pizza and casual dining spot in Fountain Hills because not only does it have incredibly consistent and good service but the food is delicious. I've had the spaghetti, the Med Dr. Oz salad, the hummus plate, the wings, the cheeseburger, the chicken breasts in risotto, the Caesar salad, the tiramisu and of course the garlic/parmesan knots. You name it and I've had it. On top of it, the place has a great outdoor dining area with a primo view of the famous fountain. Get there early on Friday and Saturday as the place fills up. There is a shortage of good, quality dine in restaurants in Fountain Hills and we're lucky to have such a great place to dine. This place is a keeper.  PS.  Little tip, on Tuesday nights is pizza night for $10. Pretty good deal if you like thin crust."}
{"text":"The location is great.  You get a nice view of the fountain. The staff is generally pretty good.   The food is OK, nothing special.  The pizza is yummy.  My kids enjoy it.  The happy hour is OK but the portion sizes small.  They could have more happy hour drink options. The guacamole is very bland and not worth it."}
{"text":"Location is amazing and there is plenty of parking spaces near by. The food was just OK, nothing special to mention. The busboys were better than the servers were. Could not find one once the food was served.   Maybe a blanket on the grass with a sandwich and a coke will be better next time.   Great views and location."}
{"text":"Some of the food here is fantastic such as the Chicken Corfu $14.95 and others like the Gyro I found to be less than good becasue the meat was very dry some parts burnt with the obviously strong taste of fish.  I sent it back and they took it off our bill.  The remainder of the meal which consisted of the Corfu, salads and soup was great and our waitress; the owners daughter promised to address the Gyro with the kitchen.  This restaurant is located at the park in Fountain Hills with unobstructed views of the lake and fountain which erupts every hour spraying water more than 500 feet in the air.  We took a nice walk in the park after dinner which was very relaxing.  Recommended"}
{"text":"Had the Italian Combo and Soup of the day, wasn't bad, the meat seems a little processed and the soup tasted like a Broccoli and cheese purée , but tried the pizza and calzone and they were great!"}
{"text":"Great patio ambiance but most limp Caesar salad ever & drenched in dressing.  Wings okay but ordered as appetizer 10 minutes before entrees and all arrived at the same time."}
{"text":"Their pizza is really good, but seem to have trouble with phone-in orders if you order more than a few items. We ordered several items for a company lunch a while ago, had to go back to get missing items.     Still recommend for the pizza!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is GREAT! Owner is always there to greet you! Staff is pleasant as well.  We enjoy breakfast, lunch or dinner here!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat at this place really often and we always get great service and amazing food. The menu has a big variety of Mediterranean meals, we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"A wonderful little restaurant, certainly our favorite in the community.  The food is great, wait staff is friendly,  and the bar can produce a very dry martini upon request (so many restaurants don't seem to know what a 'very dry' martini means).   Current favorite (and has been for some time), the Chicken Corfu.  It's a gluten free dish that comes over rice, but I usually get angel hair pasta.  The better half loves the Chipotle Chicken Pasta (spicy!) and the pizzas.  So glad they are in Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"Nice view of the fountain BUT terrible food and service. Go just for the view from the patio. Not worth it."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for breakfast after the Fearless Kitty 3K race this morning and it was delicious! I had the Florentine Benedict and she had the Euro Omelet. Both were great and a decent size portion, the perfect amount of food to enjoy after a race! The coffee was also delicious and our server Rose was very attentive and friendly. She and the server assistant kept our coffees and waters refilled, too. Next time I'm in Fountain Hills I'll check this place out again."}
{"text":"After several trips to this place I finally decided to write a review. Mostly the food is pretty good however the service can sometimes be problematic. Mostly it just takes a really long time to get in and out of there. While some people may enjoy relaxing by the fountain outdoors others that have limited time and it's in those situations one is better off probably going somewhere else.   My favorite dish there is the eggs Benedict however you have to ask for extra hollandaise sauce because what they put is not nearly enough.  The accompanying potatoes are pretty delicious.   This is one of the few places in town we can get a decent BLT as well but if you're like me and don't like them toasted you'll notice the bread is usually stale. (Something that seems to be a problem elsewhere in town as well).   I cannot recommend gyro, but the Philly cheesesteak is pretty good.   The salads are great!  The place is very clean.   Three solid stars."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night around 7:30pm, wasn't too crowded. I ordered the clam linguine and it was delicious, not to mention the generous number of clams in the dish. The white wine sauce was light, yet flavorful. Portion was definitely plentiful, I even had enough for 2 small meals the following day!   Service was fantastic. The waitress came by enough to be attentive, but not hovering. It's so rare to see service with a smile and pure genuineness in light conversation.    Prices were fair. Parking is plentiful. Next time I'm around the area, I'll surely stop by!"}
{"text":"Very decent, although a bit pricey pizza.  Cute place for dining in, especially on their fountain view outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Euro Pizza Cafe a few days ago for lunch with my girlfriend.  Yummy!  We started out with mussels and hummus plate for appetizer.  Generous portion sizes, but I can't remember the prices off-hand now.  For entree, we shared a mediterranean pizza--YUM!--topped with spinach, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes.  YUMMY!  My son had a kids pepperoni pizza (which was really big, like 10\" or 12\").  Anyway, really tasty food.  Our total bill was around $40 for 2 of us (and 3-yr-old), which included 2 apps, a 14\" pizza, a kids pizza, and an apple juice.  Totally reasonable.  Service was ok.  It was a bit busy, so we didn't get much attention.  Also, the greeter had some confusion and it took a while to get sat.  Also, the table was not clean and set.  And after the greeter wiped it down, it was kinda still dirty (enough for me to have to wipe it myself).   Will definitely return to Euro Pizza Cafe when we are back at Fountain Park."}
{"text":"Would not go here again. My family and my friend's family went here when flapjacks was closed. We sat down at our table, and there was something wet on the booth which we sat on and my iPad cover got soaked when I placed it on the table. When we ordered, I got the omelette, which was decent, and the kids got pancakes, which tasted sour. The bathrooms were both out of toilet paper, and did not appear to be replaced any time soon. The service was good, but that's it."}
{"text":"Never had such a horrible experience as at this place!!  After waiting 45 minutes for a table ....granted they were busy and this wasn't the REAL problem, BUT, after being seated the waitress took our order (pasta with broccoli) and returned 15 minutes later to almost literally drop off three little pieces of bread and then NEVER returned!  We walked out and WE will never return! Extremely poor management!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be a good breakfast alternative. It was a big disappointment. Food took over 1/2 hour to come out after ordering. It wasn't that busy. My Dad got oatmeal that tasted like instant. My friend and I ordered wraps and the chef forgot the eggs!  Our other friend ordered standard eggs Benedict. He got a Benedict with spinach, tomato and mushrooms. He hates tomato and mushrooms. Told the waitress it was wrong and she apologized saying the chef is new. No offer to replace or take off the bill.  Have been here for lunch and it was good. Won't be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"My parents and I love to visit this nugget of a restaurant in Fountain Hills, AZ often for a view of the famous Fountain at sunset.   The bartender always sets up my Father's favorite Manhattan cocktail when we enter the front door, and the food is fantastic with one of our favorite meals being the Mediterranean Pizza.  The Waitstaff is very friendly, and attentive. Our last visit was made very special by our waiter who recognized my Father's 91st birthday with a special piece of cheesecake and a candle. What a nice surprise!  Thank you. And we love the new menu and interior!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Very good food and sitting outside by the Fountain is the best when they Have live music. High recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Love Euro Pizza!  Gluten free pizza is the best!  They have a wide variety of menu items to choose from.  Atmosphere is wonderful, sits right on the fountain."}
{"text":"Euro Pizza is a really nice restaurant serving good food with a wonderful view of the fountain.   The menu is a mixture of Italian and Greek food items. We've come here several times and everything has been great and the wait staff is very attentive.   We have had most items several times. The scrimp and scallops are good, but the pesto sauce is a little bit heavy. The Pizza is good, as is the eggplant parmigiana.   Our most recent meal for three, without alcohol and tip came to $61 with one desert item.    No bad, and we saw the fountain go off twice."}
{"text":"Nice happy hour with drink, beer and food specials.  The bread brought out with the menus was yummy.  On the regular menu the linguini with clam sauce was exceptional - best I've had since Mario's in Lakeside, CA several years ago.  Unfortunately, Mario's is now only a memory as they are no longer in business.  I've tried most Italian restaurants in the area and NOT ONE came close, so happy to finally be able to satisfy that craving.   My husband had the chipotle chicken pasta & loved it.  However, it is spicy, so if spice is not your thing - pass!  Entres come with a wonderful salad (or soup).  Service was good and the outdoor patio is very nice at the right time of year.  There is a great view of the lake & fountain.  Our only complaint was the lack of adequate a/c in the indoor dining area on a warm day."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a nice lunch on a Friday afternoon, ordering a gluten-free Greek salad and a glass of house Cabernet. The salad was very fresh, with lots of nice items, just the right size for lunch,and the salad dressing was really tasty. It came with some small knotted and baked bread on the side that was buttery and was a very nice addition. I don't know what the house wine was, but is was very fruity and crisper than I would expect a house Cabernet to be. It was a nice wine, though. The staff was prompt and courteous and of course dining outside on the patio (under a covered spot) was just awesome, overlooking the Fountain. The price was right for the place for the salad, but I thought  $8 for a glass of house Cab was a bit high.   Dining outside there are unavoidable flies that will buzz around, a minor nuisance, and of course the occasional bird begging and flying low-level through the crowd. All in all quite nice! Update: Went there the next day for brunch, and had two awesome omelettes! I had the Hamburger and Spinach and my wife had the greek omelette (very flavorful)!  Two excellent visits!"}
{"text":"This was an interesting find.  If I wasn't so hungry when I arrived there and if it wasn't so windy, maybe I'd be giving this place four stars.  The inside was pretty dark and gloomy (hence our decision to sit outside on such a windy day) but the patio was great.  The service is just a bit slow...    I noticed that many people were drinking wine, some by the bottle.  I thought that was slightly odd considering it was around noon on a Sunday, but the longer we waited for our food to arrive, the better those glasses of wine looked.    Yep, this place is quite European in terms of the minimal service and wine with lunch, but the food was excellent.  They have hot and cold sandwiches that can be served on bread or \"pita.\"  I wouldn't normally order a caprese sandwich on pita bread but that's what the waitress recommended.  As it turned out, the pita was more like fresh, delicious fry bread and went great with the caprese.  The pizzas being delivered to tables around us looked pretty amazing too.  Go when you're not in a major rush, and enjoy some wine while you wait."}
{"text":"Merita runs a great restaurant.  The wait staff she has established are all personable and good at their jobs.  The menu is quite varied and enjoyed for breakfast, happy hour or whatever!  Have never had a bad dish!  Even the customers I have communicated seem to be pleasant, probably because they are enjoying the service and food!  My kinda place!!!"}
{"text":"Greek salad is absolutely amazing!!!  We have also tried the spaghetti and meatballs which is excellent. The portion size for one serving is large so come hungry.  The pizza is really made well. Favorites include the Hawaiian and the Mediterranean.  The tortellini is also done very well and the portion size is good for one and won't leave you hungry or hurting.  The calzones are very good too and very large!  They come out very quick. The Caesar salad is one not to miss as a starter. Their dressing is outstanding!  The service is so helpful and friendly and the atmosphere is very cozy Italian. The outdoor seating overlooks the fountain and the indoor seating is comfortable.  If you want to catch sports you can be sure to get a table with a view of their great TVs behind the bar."}
{"text":"This place has the nicest ambiance, a great bar, a wonderful patio and a great menu. The quality of the food is amazing. The pizza is what we enjoyed the most. Especially the 10 dollar any size pizza in the winter time. The patio in the morning is a beautiful place to have breakfast. The portion sizes are great and the waitresses are top notch as well as friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Went here for my lunch while in the area for work. Got seated outside as it was a beautiful day. The server was great! She was very attentive and had a very nice demeanor. The view was fantastic, great view of the fountain and fountain park. You'll find a lot of retirees and their families there. The food was alright. Not great. I ordered a veggie piadina with gyro meat. The piadina was very big, I could only finish half. It was also filled with veggies which was great but the veggies were bland. They gave me hummus but it was still tasteless. I ordered a tzatziki on the side and was a little better, but if it weren't for the gyro meat I don't think I'd enjoy it. I'll have to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Came here for an early Saturday morning breakfast while I waited at a cross country meet at the lake.    I loved being able to sit and relax while I had some coffee.   I didn't feel rushed which I appreciate!     I had the breakfast calzone and it rocked!!   It had scrambled eggs, ricotta mozzarella and sausage.    It comes with a great creamy marinara sauce to dip it in.     Yummy!!!!!  Great find!!"}
{"text":"I'm a local and I come here often. Food is good and staff is friendly. The view doesn't hurt either ! Bar keep Tommy is awesome"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and recommend it to people visiting the town and looking for someplace good to eat with a great view!  We have held a few church lunches here, as well as some business meeting breakfast and lunches and have always had great service and good food."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite places in town.  Great little patio with excellent view of the fountain and park.  Great consistent food, good drinks, excellent service.  Wife and I love to go late after work and relax and enjoy their food and atmosphere. ."}
{"text":"I decided a few weeks ago to take my son and wife to see the world re-known fountain in its namesake, Fountain Hills.  I had not been to this town in several years and was eager to return.  It is a great place.  In a strange way, it has an ambiance of a beach and boardwalk...........maybe it is the lake that houses the fountain?  It is a near perfect place to spend a Saturday during the high season in the Valley.    My son had a great time at the park after about two hours.  We had begun to get hungry and decided to check out the restaurants and shops near the park.  We had stumbled upon the Euro Café.  We took a look at the menu before making a decision.  It has a wide assortment of Mediterranean favorites, wine and dessert.    The prices are reasonable, generally $10 through $15 for an entree; in addition, a kid's menu is available.  I had one of my all-time favorite dishes.................linguine with clam sauce (white).  It was simply delicious; the pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce had the right amount of garlic.  My son indulged in a pizza and Caesars salad, his two favorites.  My wife had a simple pasta with tomato sauce; all good.  It even came with bread, butter and olive oil for dipping.  The service was first rate; the waiter was attentive, the food served warm and within 20 minutes.  I have a feeling I may head back to Fountain Hills this weekend after writing this review............."}
{"text":"Our lunch was a very enjoyable experience. Fabulous outdoor view of the lake and fountain, friendly and efficient service, and outstanding food. I highly recommend their sandwiches on pita bread and their tomato basil soup. Also delicious gelato. Pizza looked great; we'll try it next time Love supporting this locally owned business."}
{"text":"We love this place.  We come here every year for a disc golf tournament at the Fountain park and the Euro Pizza Café is our favorite lunch and dinner spot in Fountain Hills. We love the salads and they have great Pasta dishes. The patio is always the spot to be on a warm sunny day.  And we have always had great friendly service. Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and Tommy, the barman, was a friendly guy took really good care of us. Had the classic pizza, delicious.  They have a good selection of wines and beers. No complaints at all!"}
{"text":"Came here this weekend with my friend and absolutley loved! The place is clean and has nice service.  The View is amazing from here of the famous fountain! What I ordered:   Shrimp Pesto Quesadillas Shrimp with pesto sauce, onion, tomato, cheese, folded in a 12 inch tortilla, served w/guacamole, sour cream, and salsa.  10.50  Side of Fries  1.99  and a Sweet Tea  The food was served fresh, hot, and placed well.  My friend and I took it to go to sit in the park since it was a nice day.  So glad we stopped here it is worth every penny except she treated me so i guess it was worth her every penny haha!"}
{"text":"Euro specialty pizza was great flavors were awesome. Gyro very well made. Plenty of drink selections. Service was great very attentive but not overbearing. Great place for the family or to get together with friends for a drink."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Service can be a little slow, but good food and atmosphere.  Very cute. Love breakfast.  Name is confusing. Thought it was a pizza place, but they have more than that.  Over all, I will be back to this place."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. Tables were walking out from lack of service around us. I heard a man order a drink three times over about 30 minutes before being served. It was an alcoholic beverage. He probably would have ordered another round had he received it promptly. The staff was friendly but they just weren't helping anyone. It seemed like a management problem. There were a lot of people working and an average amount of customers but nobody was being helped. We sat there for 40 minutes and left after not being helped."}
{"text":"We have frequented this restaurant often mostly for lunch.  It is casual dining with small bar and wonderful outside seating facing the town fountain and the park. Inside the restaurant is okay decor.  Food has recently started to be very inconsistent.  You have to be careful what you order.  My husband ordered the Gyro this last visit and it was like beef jerky.  When the waitress asked how the food was, my husband told her very nicely that the meat was too tough and too dry to eat; sauce was tasteless.  She looked at the meat and agreed.  She asked if he would like to order something else and he said no as the group was already more than half way through our meals.  She said she would talk to the manager about the sandwich and be back.  Nothing was done.  The manager did not come out to say she was sorry or even acknowledge us, nor did they take the sandwich off the bill; which we did not ask for, but would have thought they would do. My humus and pita bread was good.  The other couple had the white cheese pizza which was tasty. Service from the waitress would be rated as only average at best."}
{"text":"The pizza and salad was just ok. The patio and view was outstanding. The service was awful, not to mention the waitress was hitting on my husband (who is at least 30 years younger than him by the way). Anyway I digress...we happened to be there on a Tuesday which they have a deal for $10 pizzas and half off bottles of wine, which is pretty appropriate for mediocre food."}
{"text":"My eggs and bacon were delicious and fast. The servers are friendly. The restaurant was clean and well decorated. I was able to see the Fountain Hills fountain.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is a nice cafe with a diverse menu. There's indoor or outdoor dining with a view of the famous fountain! I ate here with my friend Connie who also posted!   I ordered the Philly cheesesteak which was great! They also gave me a sample of the smokes salmon soup which was very much like it sounds. The service was excellent i was impressed. Will definitely recommend and go again myself."}
{"text":"I have to say I am completely stupefied about, what appears to be, the complete lack of expectations of the population of Fountain Hills!  Not only is this place mediocre at best, the service is horrible!  AND, I WAS truly sorry I was not able to eat the Caesar salad that consisted of old lettuce & croutons that came out of a box (& they didn't even use the inside of the Romaine lettuce, of course, but I had expected they wouldn't so my disappointment was tempered) regarding this.  When I brought the salad back, the women was incredulous, not at all sorry & she insisted I remember who I had spoken to the night before... I hate to leave really long reviews so in a nut shell, this place is only in business because the community here has such low expectations they can get away with such shenanigans!  And P.S.  By french fries were served cold & my wine was served in a warm glass that tasted like soap."}
{"text":"Tasty pi?za. Service is good. The view, setting, and ambiance is the main reason we come. Cute place. Food is pretty good, not crazy good, not bad either."}
{"text":"I wish I that I could give a negative star but one star will have to do. My family was excited to enjoy a nice lunch outside by the fountain on a Saturday afternoon and decided to try Euro Pizza Cafe. After waiting one hour for one caprese salad and one 16\" half sausage/ onion and half cheese pizza, it came out with pepperoni and mushroom instead of sausage and onion on half. When we told the server that was not what we ordered, she told us that she put in the order as sausage but the kitchen made the mistake. I guess that was supposed to make it better. She asked us if she should ask the manager to only charge for half of the pizza since the cheese part was correct. We said that would be great since we didn't order pepperoni and mushroom and won't eat it. They took the pizza away and three minutes later the same pizza arrived with the pepperoni taken off and (I can't even make this up!,) cold sausage and cold mushroom on half. It still had the pepperoni grease dripping off it. Absolutely disgusting. We said we were done and wanted to pay and this is where it got really unbelievable. They asked if wanted to take any of the pizza home with us and we said no. The manager came over and asked if we needed any help. We told the manager that we were appalled that two minutes later cold toppings had been placed on the pepperoni pizza. She told us in a snotty tone that \"I guess nothing is going to be good then. I will just take everything off the bill.\" My husband said, \"Don't do us any favors. We will pay for your cold, crappy food.\" We paid $22 for that awful food and slow, poor customer service. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here over the weekend with my dad, we had some beers and Pizza. The pizza was 5 stars by itself! Love this little place, Great view of the fountain from the patio. I want to go back soon with my wife, she will love it - They have a bunch more stuff on their menu to try as well."}
{"text":"We picked this place for dinner last Friday solely due to the fact that it had a great view of the water.  When the weather is this nice in August you need to take advantage of it.  We had the most pleasant and relaxing experience!  Our server was charismatic, helpful and funny. We ordered a starter of garlic knots, fettuccine Alfredo and a stromboli.  The food was good.    Honestly nothing really blew me out of the water, (with the exception of their blackberry lemonade. Omg you must try it!) but the overall service and atmosphere are just so lovely. I'm already wanting to go back within the next few months when it's even cooler out."}
{"text":"Not a bad find on my recent trip. Great view of the fountain, friendly service. I ordered the Chicken Tortellinni salad. Delicious. The pizza and calzones look pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Right by fountain, great location, good food with excellent service. Music several nights a week. Overall cannot go wrong here and quick if you have limited time. Known in town for a long time~ give it a try and enjoy a drink in the patio watching the fountain. Great local."}
{"text":"I really do like Euro Pizza.  The first time I had their pizza was next door at Grapeables (another great place).  The Mediterranean pizza is what we usually order from here, however we have ordered the chicken roll and the Greek salad.  So far my only complaint is the menu states the Greek salad is mixed greens but it's really ice burg lettuce (ick).    Every experience at Euro Pizza has been pleasant.  We are greeted by multiple people upon arrival, always seated right away and the view of the Fountain Park is amazing.  The staff is very attentive with refilling your waters / cocktails and the food comes out fairly quick and you always see a familiar face.   .    AND they have a great happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Not busy enough to explain the poor service. The smiles are fake, it took 27 min to get sour tea they called tropical green tea. When asked for a different drink, the waitress was very rude and said its tropical green tea. I said I know, I ordered it. I'm aware what you call it. But it tastes terrible to me. She rolled her eyes and it took another 12 min to get a replacement. The Stromboli was good. It came exactly 54 min after ordering. There are 9 tables with patrons. Too many choices in life to visit a rude, slow establishment."}
{"text":"Honestly, we eat at Euro once a week. The menu always has a wonderful selection and delicious specials! We go back for 4 reasons: the food, view, wait staff and Merita (the owner)  As a local Realtor, we frequent this spot with our clients too!  Lauren & Chris Briggs Fountain Hills Residents"}
{"text":"Euro Pizza Cafe is one of the best restaurant options in Fountain Hills.  We've been eating here at least twice a month for almost a year now and have never been disappointed.  The quality of the service and food is outstanding!  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"We've tried... multiple times, and after the latest experience won't be back. Such a shame, it's sorta cute and one of the few restaurants directly on the fountain park - a very pleasant setting.   Went for breakfast this time - we had planned to eat at home and thought \"nice day, let's eat breakfast out\". Sat down at 9:25. About 10 minutes later got coffee. Food arrived at 10:05... yes, 40 minutes after sitting down they managed to finally get eggs on the table. My frittata was thrown together and looked like a mess. Taste was ok, I've had WAY better. My partner's veg omelette was very plain. Both just warm. Cold toast. Barely warm and very mediocre home fries. One refill on the coffee. Virtually no visits from waitress to check on us. A minute after food was delivered discovered no salt or pepper on table, but good luck getting someone's attention so we did without. For your toast, hey serve the same little \"mixed fruit\" jelly containers one gets at Denny's.  We went on Memorial Day, but I counted about 10 tables occupied (guessing about 25% capacity) so they certainly should have been able to keep up.  I certainly don't slam businesses for the fun of it. This place needs to get its act together (if they care and bother reading these reviews), or maybe they can get away with it because they're the only one on the fountain. In any case, my partner summarized it well as we walked out to the car: \"well... that wasn't worth the calories!\"  The following comment is just an FYI and has nothing to do with the review or how we feel about the place: they call themselves \"dog friendly\" but actually, dogs are not allowed on the property. Patrons are \"allowed\" to keep their dogs tied outside the perimeter fence of the outside patio, in other words, not in or on restaurant property.   We'll try it again if we ever see a \"under new management\" sign. Too bad."}
{"text":"We had stopped at Grapeables next door and decided to look at the menu for Euro Pizza Cafe, that's all it took to lure us in. My wife has celiac disease so we need to have a Gluten Free menu items. Very busy on a Saturday night, very homey, lots of people eating pizza (go figure)."}
{"text":"Just moved to FH -- we're yuppy's - husband and I trying all of the local places  The Good: - awesome location on the lake - patio overlooks lake - great spot for sundowner - really good breakfast with Bloody Mary's - best eggs benedict I've had in a long time - went here for a drink - live music was great  Looking forward to trying the food, but the service, atmosphere and drinks are great"}
{"text":"The staff greets you at the door and is very friendly. Service is timely. The premises are clean. There is patio dining available when the weather cooperates. Easy parking."}
{"text":"this place is horrible.  the chef insists her vegetable soup is pasta fagoli.  if you are going to cook italian please get a real italian to cook... and get some waiters that know what they are doing!  nice location hopefully someone will buy this place out and cook real food"}
{"text":"We visited Fountain Hills on 9/16-9/24.  We had breakfast at the Euro Pizza Cafe 2 times, lunch 1 time, and dinner (pizza) 1 time.  Obviously we really liked the restaurant.  Service was outstanding!  Very patient and helpful.  The outdoor patio is a great place to relax and enjoy the view of the mountains and the fountain.  Beer selection was very good and the beer is the coldest beer in town. (Served in a frosty glass).   Highly recommend Euro Pizza Cafe!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Thin crust tastes like its fire oven cooked.  Pro's: Clean dinning area Patio seating Clean bathrooms Friendly staff 1 pizza  1 pop  2 Mai Tai drinks total tab $35"}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Fountain Hills we decided on an early dinner/late lunch here. Since we weren't in any hurry and sitting outside on a beautiful day it worked out well. I had a calzone with meatballs and hubby had the chicken sandwich. The calzone could have used more filling as it was mostly bread. I was able to bring half home for another day which was good. Hubby's sandwich was good so no complaints there. We would stop by again but not go out of our way to eat here."}
{"text":"For a town that is ever-changing and restaurants come and go, there's a reason why after 15 years Euro (Pizza) Cafe is still going strong. The owner has the passion and drive of a true restaurateur. There's a sense of consistency and excitement with their food. Certain items, like the signature pizzas are classics and also on point for true pizza aficionados. Dinner and lunch entrées are seasonal and unique but with a Mediterranean/Italian flare. Definitely go for at least a pizza, glass of wine and a spectacular view, if nothing else."}
{"text":"Great food, and great staff make for a wonderful dining experience. A special place with a wonderful sense of community."}
{"text":"The avocado salad here is to die for! So fresh and light. Even the zesty orang dressing! The hummus dip and pizza were tasty too. All though I'm not a fan of breakfast, my boyfriend loved it!"}
{"text":"Service was so slow.  There was what appeared to be an abundance of help with very little efficiency.  My food arrived 10+ min after the rest of our party's meals.  One employee literally rolled her eyes at our friend when she asked for clarification on a to go order she placed.  The one positive was the view and the food was good once it finally arrived."}
{"text":"My folks love this place and took me there for breakfast last weekend.  I must assume that it was just a bad day but the way the handled it tells me I wont go back.  We sat for 20 minutes before we finally flagged down a waitress who then told us that though this was not her section (every table around ours was somehow) that she would still help us.  We placed our order and 30 minutes later, we got our breakfast...cold, overcooked and tasteless.  Our poached eggs where hard cooked, the omelets dark brown from burn, hollandaise that was tasteless and runny. We voiced our complaints and where told that the kitchen was having a bad day but no form of atonement was offered.  I really don't think we should have had to pay fully for our meal or at least a free drink or something to say \"I'm sorry for your crap meal but come back and we will prove we don't completely suck\""}
{"text":"Wonderful place to enjoy pizza (try the Hero Pizza), calzones, and homemade pita w/Tzatziki sauce. Delicious! The service here is great as well as it's dark and cool to duck out of the 3-digit temps for a bit. Has a \"Sporty/Italian\" vibe to it."}
{"text":"Best Bartender! Very friendly and awesome food!! For sure a favorite! Priced great for large dishes :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Fountain Hills! Just moved here from Chicago and tried a new pizza place every Friday until we found the right one. This was it! Good crust, not too much garlic, good flavor and not overly greasy. The people that work there are really nice and welcoming and they even have you look at the pizza to make sure it's to your liking before you leave. Finally! A pizza place I can enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is good (e.g.  like the veggie piadina).  Service is unpredictable.  On a recent visit, waited 15 minutes before anyone took our order and even offered water.  View is fantastic.  But not for the view, probably would go elsewhere for lunch.  My advice: order an iced tea and hope for the best.  Or, go next door to Grapeables Wine Bar and order a glass of wine (preferable)."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza, amazing service. I was blown away by the level of service. We had three kids with us and he took such great care of us.   Thank you Bleri for such a great experience!"}
{"text":"I had a very cool experience with this restaurant so I felt like I had to share.  I've visited the area many times and saw the restaurant but never gave it a try until now and I'm so glad I did!  I was celebrating a kid's birthday at the splash pad about 100 feet away from Euro Pizza Cafe. I must admit I did initially pick this place for the party based on proximity  but wow was I impressed with both the food and service!   They are open early for breakfast and that was very fortunate for us. I wanted the pizza to be ready at 1045. Not a lot of choices since 11 am is the most common opening time for pizza restaurants. Even better than those convinces was their customer service!  They stored our cupcakes that we brought in their walk in fridge until 1045 so they wouldn't melt! How cool is that? Oh, and the pizza was delicious!   This place has been voted best pizza in Fountain Hills several times and I see why.  Great crust, sauce and cheese quality!  We had them cut it up for kids and that was perfect. Big kids took the wider slices and littlest ones took the super small cuts. Worked out perfectly!  So to recap, if you're going to have a birthday party at the nearby park and you may consider pizza for it...  1. They open early so there's a lot of flexibility... 2. Could they be any closer? 3. Nice enough to store our cupcakes brought in from somewhere else so they wouldn't melt! 4. VERY GOOD PIZZA!"}
{"text":"When I go out to eat I expected high quality food. I didn't know the menu asked the waitress to recommending something healthy she recommended my roast vegetable dish oh my it'sTerrible!  I didn't want to say anything for them to re make it they might put crazy stuff in my food so I have to suck it up paying for bad food.  Calzone was alright if you're an average person who not really out to eat anywhere!  Keep it Simple pepperoni and cheese.  But for me will never come back again!  The sad part the waitress didn't even offer to remake it or anything!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. I wouldn't consider myself a pizza diva but I can seriously appreciate the pie served up here. I love white pizzas and so naturally I order that everywhere I go, this place takes the cake. I also love their garlic knots and salads. It's family owned and you can tell from the welcoming environment as soon as you enter the door. If the weather is nice you should sit on the patio and watch everything happening at the fountain."}
{"text":"We didn't eat, for the record, so this review is based on the experience of having an afternoon drink on a lovely day.   The beer list is pretty short, but the limited choices offer enough variety. The problem was that we were rushed out of there, even though we specifically said that we were only going to have drinks. We were seated at an outdoor table and it was very nice, but if they didn't want us taking up a table outside they should have told us to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here twice and both times I have loved the food and enjoyed the atmosphere. Tonight we were seated at a corner table with a great view of the fountain. I had the Dr. Oz veggies with grilled chicken and it was really good. Can't wait to go back when it's a bit cooler to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"After 'Love in the Hills' event on Valentine's Day, my wife and I decided to try and have dinner at Euro Pizza. We got there in time to be seated immediately. We sat more to the front of the restaurant and furthest away from a view of the fountain. So it seem we were in any typical restaurant, nothing special.  Our waitress was okay. Told us the special of the day  for Valentines, which I had. My wife started with a glass of wine and I had their Lemonade which wasn't that great. It didn't have that tart or sweetness flavor. My wife had a glass of wine and we ordered our entrees.  My wife had the 14\" Classic pizza and I had the Valentines Special for $20 which included a salad, 8 oz sirloin steak with aspargus and pilaf plus a choice of desserts.   My wifes pizza looked great and she thoroughly enjoyed it. On the other hand, the salad I had was pre-made. You can just tell that it was plated and had Saran wrap over it. It  was still fresh and with the Blue Cheese dressing, it was satisfying. My entree came and it looked pretty good. My steak was covered with brown gravy and the steak was cooked perfectly except it was pretty dense and chewy. I don't know if it was sirloin 'cause it looked like processed meat. The pilaf or gravy was WAY to salty and I just couldn't eat the pilaf. My 4 asparagus was cooked nicely. For dessert, I chose the Pecan Pie which was half the size of a regular slice of pie. I guess you get what you pay for. I don't consider my meal as a Valentine's Special but more like a Senior Special. Our total bill came to $46.  If I go back again, I would order their Pizza instead of their dinners because they seem more adapt at making them."}
{"text":"Went in to fill a growler and I wish I would I had time to stay. Great price on beer and the food looked Amazing. The manager was extremely nice and offered us beer samples while we waited. Can't wait to come back when I play another round of disc Golf next door"}
{"text":"This place has delicious pizza and greek salad! It is right by a splash park and an enormous fountain so definitely kid friendly. The wait staff was nice. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm pleasantly surprised! I made a reservation for about 7 people at noon and Euro Pizza was able to easily accommodate everyone. I got a white pizza with ricotta, 14\". It was WAY bigger than I expected but it was really delicious and I'm happy I was able to share it with my co-workers. There's a really beautiful back patio that overlooks blue water that I'd be excited to take advantage of when it's not a 1000 degrees in Arizona.  If you're in the area and want some good Italian American cuisine, definitely try this place."}
{"text":"The best part of this Restaurant is the location with a great view of fountain hills lake. Wines prices are reasonable. The pizza was good ( not brick oven) but the ingredients are good. Overall a good place for casual dining or stop by in the afternoon and have a cup of cofee and watch the sunset"}
{"text":"Not the best pizza place, but the atmosphere was nice.  Great outdoor seating with views of the fountain."}
{"text":"I gave this an additional star since my last review. Because the waitress was nice, had a one-liner that made us laugh, and because the tuna salad wasn't half bad. I met a group there that'd been there for breakfast.... they stayed there long enough to wait for me and we turned it into lunch. The all ordered again and I ordered a beer and a tuna sandwich on toast.  The waitress was VERY nice and when she was there super helpful and listened to us. That being said, it took forever for her to have a chance to notice me and come take my order - I believe I was there for at least 10 minutes before I was even acknowledged. The beers here were pretty cold. Not sure they were served at the 'right' temp, but I was happy with it (WAY better than the near-warm beer that I reported on last weekend). I noticed my seatmate was drinking a beer of a color that wasn't listed on the menu, come to find out that they had Blue Moon on tap and it wasn't listed (boo - I would have rather had that the first time).   Tuna sandwich - the tuna mix was good (the gal beside me had it and hers had a few black olives in it, I believe that was an error because mine had none). The downside was it took LITERALLY forever, probably 20 or 25 minutes. I asked for it on sour dough toast, it came on sour dough toast, but it was cold. Sure, the tuna may have been cold but warm toast should have been noticeable. It was not. It wasn't overly onioney, one of the things I hate most about tuna salad in restaurants.  My receipt says the waitress was Dani. She was super nice and listened and took action when we asked for things. I don't know if they've got them so busy that they neglect the tables or if it's just not proper training, but I did feel neglected. Especially as a late-comer and sitting there so long before I was even approached the first time.  Last visit was 2 stars for lack of service and 'meh' food. This time they got 3, because Dani did an okay job and the tuna was good. Here's hoping they do a little training with their staff for my next visit . . . . ."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and the food was great. They have great indoor and outdoor seating options, and a great view of the fountain. I liked that they had traditional breakfast items, but also some inventive things like breakfast pizza and breakfast quesadillas. The service was great and we got our food quickly. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The place is a nice very casual place to eat.... . We ate outside and had a nice few of the lake with the fountain.    The food that we order was good include the pasta and the spicy eggplant & shrimp dish... The servers could have been a little better... In all I would go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Loves, how can a restaurant mess up spaghetti? You start eating it then your like this tastes like spaghettios, and after that you don't want to eat it anymore. I've had pizza here during lunch with a family member which was nice, but my lunch here alone wasn't so nice.  The noodles for the spaghetti was over cooked and the sauce was orange and tasteless. I'm not impressed, and I'll only go again for the lunch priced pizza."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place! My fav is the special omelette with garlic, chicken, cheese and spinach (with a side of hollendaise sauce) and an extra spicy Bloody Mary if brunch. Husband always orders the daily breakfast special and has never been disappointed. Lovely view of the Fountain and park."}
{"text":"I ducked in this place for a quick bite on V Day. The Grecian pizza pie ordered was OK. Nothing spectacular.  The wings were saturated in sauce and not very tasty. Wish I didn't order it.  My salad was also just ok. The place offers a great view of the fountain /Park so at least it wasn't a total loss."}
{"text":"Better bfast burritos at Señor Taco but still decent and better view/service. Semi dog-friendly patio (dogs must be leashed on outside of patio railing).  Decent happy hour 2-6pm.  Good beer selection for a place this size (9-10 beer taps).  Really friendly service.  Bar pendant lights should be dimmed."}
{"text":"The view of the fountain is gorgeous, so sitting outside is a must! The food is okay. We ordered iced tea and chicken caprese sandwiches. I had soup as my side. The soup of the day was clam chowder and it was very good. The sandwich was just okay. It came on ciabatta and would have been better on a lighter bread.  Go for the view!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night and had a seat at the bar. From the moment I walked in the door the staff greeted me and made me feel right at home. Shout out to Tommy the bartender who was a total professional.  I tried the Classic pizza which was head and shoulders above most places. Looks like they have a balanced menu , there some great choices beyond pizza. Awesome family owned business , highly recommended."}
{"text":"We have taken food out here twice and the first time the lamb and the entrees were delicious.  The second time we ordered a large pizza and when we got home we noticed they left off two of the toppings.  The pizza is pretty good it is not NY style or even CA style more of a brick oven Mediterranean style.  The food is pretty good especially the greek food.  One of the better restaurants in town, the only thing is the owner seems to serve herself first even while people are waiting to be seated or waiting for their own pizza."}
{"text":"Kristin has a great smile and the food and service was fantastic.  The Fountain went off while we ate. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Stopped here during our week long trek in Arizona. Looked for a quick stop for 5 adults and 3 young children. Service and food was phenomenal. Pizza was great as was our server and the California chicken sandwich. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"They aren't a coffee shop but my goodness they have the BEST iced coffee I've ever had... And I've had A LOT of iced coffee. I don't know if they use magical beans or if Claudia is an iced coffee making goddess but I can't imagine ever having the sludge at the big name coffee places ever again. Oh, and the remodel looks amazing!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place has the worst service!! The food is decent and the views are great but the service sucks and the owner doesn't make it right when issues arise. If someone's food gets messed up twice and then comes out when everyone is done eating, you comp it!! I didn't even have time to eat my food. Such a waste. Our family and friends have been coming here for years but we will be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good Italian food. Metro style pizza with lots of options and combinations. Also other Italian food, but I always get one of their fantastic pizzas. Sit out side next to the fountain for ambience."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner at the Euro Pizza Cafe. We went on a Wednesday night. It was very busy on the patio, but we had no problem getting a table with a perfect view of the Fountain. There was a guitarist and vocalist on the Grapeables patio next door, so we even had some music to add to the ambiance.   Our waitress was very nice and accommodating.  We started off with the Hummus appetizer and Garlic Knots. The Hummus was awesome. It had a little kick because of the cayenne pepper, but not too much. It was a little thick and gritty, which I can get into sometimes.  It was served with pizza dough that had been grilled and sliced like pita. Incredible. I really can't say enough about how amazing this appetizer was. I highly reccommend it.   The garlic knots were delicious as well. The sauce that they serve to dip them in was so good that I could eat it with a spoon, and I don't do that sort of thing!  For dinner I got a simple greek salad, which was ok- nothing exciting. I would probably skip the salad next time and get something else off the appetizer menu and really gorge myself.  The rest of my party ordered a cheese pizza and really enjoyed it. My mother and husband split an order of meatballs as well, and they raved about how amazing they were. Moist and flavorable.  We are excited to go back to the Euro Pizza Cafe soon!"}
{"text":"Just finished having lunch here. Our group was big and the staff had no problem accommodating all of us. The food came out fast and it was delicious. Portion size is big, so expect to bring home yummy leftovers. :)"}
{"text":"Positives:  Great location.  Good vibe.  Lots of outdoor seating.  That's about it.  Food was horrible.  The mussels appetizer had no flavor.  They ran out of chicken wings.  How do you run out of chicken wings?  Gyro Pizza looked good, but was dry as a bone.   Service was very slow.  Waitress was full of excuses, but no action.  I had to go inside, almost to the kitchen,  to get my food.  Cannot recommend."}
{"text":"This is my place to go to whenever I head to fountain hills. I love their wings and Caesar salad! I tried other menu items and loved it, can't complain. The view of the fountain is beautiful too its feet away"}
{"text":"Nice update of decor, new tables and chairs and enlarged bar, with adequate happy hour menu which uniquely includes a pretty decent BLT for $5.    Unfortunately, I ordered the HH nachos, which was a big mistake. Excellent thin crisp chips, some kind of okay chopped meat (chicken?), but covered with a disgusting thing, viscous and COLD sauce where warm melted cheese should be. Should be taken off of the menu, or ask anyone other than you kitchen how to make one.  On second thought, I should have expressed my disappointment, but no one asked how anything was.  And we had to flag down a server after being ignored for at least 10 minutes to order our first round of drinks.  View from the back patio remains the highlight of the place. Stick with the Italian items for the best food!"}
{"text":"Meh. I really wanted to like this place with its outdoor seating overlooking the fountain. Unfortunately, the staff seems to be completely unorganized and oblivious. Thankfully, the food is decent but I don't feel compelled to return."}
{"text":"First time in Arizona and found this restaurant across from our hotel.  Was very busy on a Saturday night and when we got our dinners we learned why.  Excellent food!  Way more available here than just pizza.  I had Baked Fish w/Avocado lemon sauce and my companions had Eggplant Parmigiana.  Wait staff was attentive and pleasant.  I would certainly come back again, often."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in FH. We have only gone for dinner and tried pizza, pastas, calzone, wings, side salads (I recommend their balsamic dressing- I usually don't like balsamic but theirs is delish!) and garlic knot/bread. All really good. They have great service- very friendly servers and even on busy nights we get seated fairly quickly. The owner is really nice. We liked sitting inside as well as outside. The place always has people when we walk by, and the food smells good."}
{"text":"The food was not bad. My fiancé and I both had pizza (me pepperoni and him sausage). I would definitely like to try something else if we go again, but we had a couple complications with the service.   We were in a group of 15+, which I know is pretty difficult to keep up with, but right off the bat the waiters started forgetting to bring people drinks. Then, the waiter brought out a Philly cheesesteak pizza instead of a sandwich (which is what my friend ordered) and the waitress got mad at HER.   Also, another person ordered a Chardonnay and instead of asking which one (house or speciality) she wanted they brought her the specialty. She didn't notice until she got the bill and it was more expensive."}
{"text":"Great scenery.  Regularly mixes up orders or gets them wrong. Staff is overwhelmed when the place gets busy.  Food is OK"}
{"text":"Loved being there lunching and gazing at the fountain. Great spaghetti and sautéed veggies on fab pita. My 95 year old mother in law really enjoyed herself. No bread came with the spaghetti though to stop up delicious marinara."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We came here for breakfast and sat in the patio. The view of the fountain is great. The mighty veggie omelet is great! Perfect place to catch brunch/breakfast and has reasonable price. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"There are a handful of restaurants right on the park and this is one of them. We were attracted to the outdoor seating on a beautiful day. There is more seating outdoors than in and the inside feels more like a bar, with TVs playing sports. We came around 2:30pm and surprisingly had to wait for a table. Once seated, the staff began service that was quite friendly, but as the meal went on, we got less and less attention and an apathetic attitude. I don't think it was anything we did. Our party of 4 each got entrees and shared an appetizer.  I had the chicken wings mild which were quite weak. They make them crunchy here which is something I like but I wish I had gotten the hot ones. Mild just didn't do it for me. The lines for the bathroom were long and there were most certainly non customers using them. There is one bathroom for each gender that is a one-person-at-a-time kind. For a place that is named Euro Pizza, none of us got pizza, which should tell you something..."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! The location is one of the best spot you can have to admire the big fountain. Food is really good and fresh! I recommend the insalata caprese!! My server, Elizabeth, was nice and very attentive!! Price are very reasonable. This is definitely one of my favorite casual place to dine when I visit Fountain Hills!  Concluding: 5 stars for excellent service, good food, good location, and reasonable prices. ;-)"}
{"text":"This is one of our regular places where we go to eat.  It doesn't matter what meal - breakfast, lunch or dinner...it is excellent. I personally love their pasta dishes. Hubby quite likes their pizzas. Either way it is great food consistently any time we have gone. I can honestly say that there hasnt been a bad meal here since we have been going to this restaurant.   Love the terrace eating in front of the fountain park. Music from Grapeables sometimes.  An eating establishment that has great food, great ambiance, reasonably priced meals, & friendly staff...what more can one ask for. A favourite place for me to eat out!!"}
{"text":"Euro is our absolute favorite spot in town!  Any meal of the day, we are never disappointed.  The staff is always upbeat and friendly.  The overall atmosphere is pleasant and inviting.  Whether you chose to sit at the bar and enjoy happy hour, a peaceful table inside for a family meal, or enjoy a scenic meal on the outdoor patio, all of the options are great.  The menu is varied and it is easy to find something to suit everyone's tastes.  If you are looking for a good meal and a pleasant environment in Fountain Hills look no further."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem tucked away in shopping center  10.0-- great ambience. Recommend outdoor patio with park, playground, and lake with fountain show  10.0-- pizza - we ordered a mushroom , black olive, bell pepper pizza. 2nd pizza with pepperoni and Italian sausage  Pizza was delicious and had leftovers after 6 people sharing 2 pizzas. Very light tasting. Crust was flavorful and crunchy . Great combination   Best pizza I have tasted in Phoenix metro area!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday during happy hour with 4 other people, greeted by the hostess very and got a table outside like we asked and got drinks very quickly. Our waitress was very good kept out beers/sangrias coming and the food came quickly. I would recommend anyone coming to fountain hills to visit this place!"}
{"text":"With family, went here for my wife's birthday. I placed the reservation over the phone a few days before. The woman on the other end of the line was quite pleasant. I asked if they might be willing to turn the air down a little if it got too warm. She asked the owner, who was standing beside her. The owner cheerfully agreed.   When we arrived, the place was busy (this is good), but warm. I visited the front counter to ask the servers if they could turn the air down. Instead, I ended up speaking with the owner. I mentioned it was my wife's birthday and that I'd called before and asked if the air could be turned down. Without hesitation, the owner agreed. Within a few minutes, the place cooled down--which all of us genuinely appreciated.   Everyone enjoyed their meal; however, the server could have been a little more attentive. Several glasses were empty throughout the meal. And perhaps I expected too much, but I informed the restaurant twice (once in placing the reservation over the phone, and informing the owner while we were there) that it was my wife's birthday, but they didn't bother to recognize it in any way. They didn't even wish her a happy birthday. To be fair, the place was busy, but our bill was over $150...I guess I expected a little more.   The food and atmosphere were great; the service was okay. Still, we liked it enough to come back."}
