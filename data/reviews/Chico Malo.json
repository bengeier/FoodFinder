{"text":"This place is in a great location and has a good atmosphere. We went. For happy hour and it was a little disappointing. There weren't many drinks to choose from and the happy hour appetizer portions were ridiculously small."}
{"text":"The food was great and the customer service was exceptional. We were unfamiliar with the cuisine so we asked our waitress to surprise us.... it was terrific. Would have given it 5 stars but it was a tad noisy for me (grumpy old 50 year old) 

I'd go back"}
{"text":"Came here after Stand Up Live, place looks cool and with a modern Mexican style. Service was great and food came out quick. I was raised on Mexican food and this place reminded of growing up. With the chorizo and papas, I loved the food. It's different then your ordinary Mexican food. But that's okay, it's bringing you a different experience with a unique style! Try it out, food is tasty and it's a Classy joint!"}
{"text":"Loved our server! Enjoyed the al pastor and pollo tingy tacos the best!!! Awesome table guac!"}
{"text":"The menu is disappointing. Not much to choose from. The sangria had a funky clove flavor. Our table ordered several of what they said were there most popular dishes and we were all underwhelmed. On a good note, the waiter was very nice."}
{"text":"Chico Malo has a really fun and young vibe, it has remarkable tacos and great salsa. I attempt to try most new places in the area and love salsa so I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this place. I have been back 3 times since then."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a flavorful experience, I recommend stopping here. The Elotes are a must try, and the Margaritas are blended wonderfully. The prices are a bit high for the size of the servings. I went with one other person, and our bill was $60 for one appetizer, two entrees, and two drinks. Other than that, the restaurant is great and I plan on coming back to check out the happy hour deals."}
{"text":"Going to keep it very simple, overpriced and underwhelming. Their \"happy hour\" consists of a small menu of items that are not priced differently from the regular menu which is also deceiving. Only bright spot is the construction of the restaurant which was definitely not something they held their budget back from. That would explain $5-$6 cost per taco."}
{"text":"I went to the soft opening last Wednesday. Awesome place and much needed in Downtown Phoenix! It JUST opened so I'd give them some time, but the Guac Cart was super cool, drinks were really unique and different (and delicious) and the whole atmosphere had a great vibe. The waiters and waitresses were very friendly and gave great tips. HIGHLY RECOMMEND the corn appetizer!! It's not a cheap place, definitely more of an upscale restaurant, which I think is usually lacking in Downtown. Cannot wait to try this place again."}
{"text":"Amazing decor, fun vibe, awesome staff!!!! Drinks were on point, and the management was super-hands on and visible. Expect delicious Mexican food with a unique twist. Phoenix is lucky to have you :-)"}
{"text":"Gorgeous food but you will go away hungry I like the art but pls put something substantial on the menu."}
{"text":"Chef driven with great service and fair pricing. Chico Malo lived up to the hype and delivered an awesome culinary experience. The space is decorated famously and every detail was thought of. This will be a new staple in my rotation. Keep up the great work Chico Malo staff!"}
{"text":"Wow! This food was amazing! The vibe.. in sane! Local artists making the place look so sweet and hip.. and Angel.. what a great server! Well Angel made the experience a whole lot sweeter! Great new spot. Will he back!"}
{"text":"Incredibly overpriced for food that was nothing to write home about. Also, Chico Malo overcharged me seventy dollars for a twelve dollar meal and took nearly two weeks to refund me."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is pretty good too, but a bit a bit over priced for the quantity of food. $14 for 3 tacos with no sides? They were great tacos at least. That's really my only gripe. Staff was super friendly and atmosphere was cool. I'd recommend coming here again"}
{"text":"Wow. Not sure why all the food hipsters are being so hard on this joint. Is it a little pricey? Sure, but this is a gourmet taco spot, not a Taco Bell.
The food is really good and there are some creative combinations. The best, however, are the duck carnitas with mole. Oh, my, goodness! I had no idea that mole and duck were the perfect pairing. Worth it just for that."}
{"text":"Such an amazing restaurant that the downtown Phoenix scene is very lucky to have. I will come regularly from old town Scottsdale to eat here over many of the Latin American restaurants around my house. All of the food and drinks were delicious and innovative. The vibe and the atmosphere of the restaurant was very modern and inviting. Some of the best acoustics I've experienced in a restaurant, place was packed and we had great conversation amongst six people. The service was fast and friendly and the owner came out to say hi which made the night. Cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! The table side guacamole was one of the best I've had and the margaritas were the real deal. Looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm really confused by reviewers who complain about small portions or high prices.  Do a little a research before going and adjust your expectations accordingly!  This is not a \"Mexican food\" restaurant like one of the -berto's.  Think Joyride Taco (but better) or Blanco Tacos (but more inventive).

Needless to say, Chico is an awesome addition to the downtown dining scene.  I've been here twice for lunch already, and the food and service was excellent both times.  The baja fish taco is an early favorite -- the orange cumin gel and black garlic crema on the fish taco are an inspired combination.  I also highly recommend the Nichie's appetizer -- I can't really explain it, so just trust me and order it.

This and Bluehound are probably my top two right now for a lunch spot right downtown.  I'm excited to go back and eat my way through the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to a Diamondback's game while visiting Phoenix from out of town(I know they're not good!) and decided to stop at Chico Malo after the game. Great decision! I had the Carne Asada, and my wife had the Pollo Tinga. You could tell all the ingredients are fresh and the portion sizes are perfect! We finished it off with my wife's favorite, the Tres Leches Rice Pudding! The cripsy rice was delicious! We absolutely recommend anyone who visits downtown PHX should stop in!"}
{"text":"Great ambience enhanced by the live DJ. Great service, delicious rib eye, great drinks! Love the decor & vibe! Will return!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Their Argentinian Apple pepper sauce is spicy and delicious. My husband and I tried different tacos and they were all good. But my favorite was the Short rib. But their Elite, OMG! That was super delicious. I hope you guys get Mario when you go, cause yp7 just must go. Mario was great, friendly, efficient. Just made this place even better. BTW- Get the Margarita!"}
{"text":"Eh, I've been excited for this place to open. The place is really nice looking but the food isn't that good. Way overpriced, even for downtown. The street taco tortilla is tiny. The ingredients don't seem to flow together and not tasty. Tried the Baja fish and Al Pastor.... I'll try it again when they're open for awhile and see if the food and flow at the place come together.  Customer service was good but you can tell they're still trying to figure things out."}
{"text":"First time going, my roommate introduce me to Chico malo, it was amazing. We went for food and drinks. I had a bomb cocktail called a Loma bonita they make grapefruit soda in house and used that and garnished it with a edible flower making it look beautiful like the name. I had a pork verde that melted in my mouth and came with a green sauce and tortillas my roommate had a few tacos he said the duck carnitas was his favorite along with the avocado taco. Now the look and ambiance was something out of a art show with several different art instillation throughout the building that the staff was more then willing to explain. Fun fact the light fixtures are sourced locally from HINKLEYS a local LIGHT fixture company."}
{"text":"Chef Chops is killing it!! Bomb a$$ tacos, pork verde so good it will bring a tear to your eye. Definitely try the Duck Carnitas tacos and the Baja Fish Tacos and the Arroz (trust me kids) and the homemade hot sauce -and definitely don't forget to order table side guacamole!! 

Are you getting the picture?? Try EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"Chico Malo is a refreshing take on Mexican food. We went there and totally enjoyed the various tacos. The fried avocado taco was excellent as well as their pork verde. 
  Our waiter (Joseph) provided us with great service. He knew the menu well and made excellent recommendations for everyones pallet. If I had a restaurant I would snatch him away in a instant. We were very impressed with him! 
  Give this place a try, I promise you will enjoy the food and the excellent service. I will definitely be back to sample all of their menu."}
{"text":"The drinks, food, and service was amazing! Their verde salsa was tasty, and their chimichanga was particularly delicious. All of their sauces were impressive! Our service was fantastic - shout out to Tara specifically. The music and vibe of the restaurant was really nice for a Friday night out. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There aren't too many Mexican dining options downtown, so I stopped by on Saturday night. The restaurant was super cool looking inside. It felt like we were in a restaurant in Vegas rather than just downtown Phoenix. 

Our table started off with the Montezuma chips and salsa. I'm a total chicken when it comes to spice, but the salsa was so good I kept on eating even though my mouth was on fire. The chips were fresh and still warm when they got to table, which is always appreciated. I had the duck carnitas, pork belly and the short rib tacos. Definitely do the pork belly! My friend loved her crispy avocado tacos. 

Their drink menu is quite unique and it'll be fun to go back and try more. Our table had the Bolo de Coco (do this if you're a fan of coconut and banana), a margarita on the rocks with pineapple, La Calavera (huge shared drink) and the Loma Bonita, which was my favorite. The grapefruit soda in this was perfect - tart, fizzy and full flavored. 

I'll update the review after a few more visits to get the full experience. Next time I want to try the elote, pork belly tostada and anticuchos."}
{"text":"My first time to Chico Malo and I will be back! I loved the artwork and overall vibe of the restaurant. The staff was friendly and kept checking on us. The Chips and salsa were fresh and I love the homemade guacamole. I ordered the Chulo salad and it was the perfect vegetarian option. Don't miss out on such an awesome spot in Downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Walked by this restaurant the other day & had to come back to check it out. Went there last night & for being opening night everything looks to be already running smoothly. The servers were super friendly & knowledgeable, the food options were great & the food was even better! For the quality of food and the atmosphere, the prices were spot on. All of the food came out in a timely fashion as well! Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix we went to Chico Malo with our group. Dinner was excellent and the location was great downtown. The indoor outdoor bar was great and the service was to notch. Guacamole tacos were were a favorite among the group!"}
{"text":"I was still hungry after my meal! I was very excited to try this new place near my office for lunch today as I love tacos and Mexican food. I ordered the pork belly taco and the pollo tinga taco. The flavors of both were very good. However, the servings were similar to street tacos without the double tortilla. For the price, $12, it was not a lot of food.  Taste was good, but way overpriced for what you get. 

I sat at the bar. The gentleman next to me had the Caesar salad. He ended up ordering more food due to the small portion size as well. 

I also didn't like that the manager walked away with my debit card for over 5 minutes rather than ringing me up right away. 

Very disappointed. My 2 stars are for the taste only."}
{"text":"The Chico Malo website said they are open until 10 pm, the restaurant closed at 9.  Came recommended by our hotel."}
{"text":"Very interesting menu. They put together some amazing dishes that work well. 
We had avacado tacos and Jarinero torta. Wow, was real tasty"}
{"text":"Had the scallop ceviche and vegetable skewers (that came with this ridiculously good key lime cream). Staff was friendly, helpful, efficient. Portions were generous, so 1 appetizer + 1 side were enough for one person. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great unique spin on Spanish cuisine! The food is on point and the drinks are even better. More tequila here then I knew what to do with. Been here a few times and food is always top of the line and service makes you feel welcomed. Love going here and look forward to my next visit it! Oh and they make fresh churros...they are extraordinary!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the second time recently after a v good first experience back in July.
- 1st time, sat at bar, good friendly service from bartender and v nice food.
- 2nd time, sat on balcony and had some the worst service I've ever experienced. 
I don't recall the servers name but he was short with dark hair, chubby and wearing lots of make up.
 Every interaction with this puke was horrendous and just nasty, from being pissed we weren't ready to order after 30seconds with the menu, to rolling his eyes at us for returning a flat beer (he didn't  know beer should have bubbles, he 'doesn't drink beer, he drinks vodka'! Why the hell he thought that comment was appropriate I have no idea) He was a constant little baby until put in his place at which point he tried to make conversation with us, which was so cringeworthy it made us laugh out loud.
 The highlight was watching him have a bar tender stir our flat beer with a straw and try to return it to us as a new one! The look on his face when he saw us watching.
Big fat $0 tip for being a little baby.

No manager 'available' unfortunately when we were about to leave.
 
Apart from the terrible 'salsas' (Christ only knows who tasted them and sent them out) the food was great."}
{"text":"This is a Mexican Restaurant with a twist. Very good food! And Excelente service. We were a little hesitant at the beginning but our waiter give us options and work with the chef to give us alternatives and we are glad we stayed. It was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I will say the first time was a great experience....this time not so much. I was celebrating my birthday with a group of friends (there were 9 of us) and we decided to grab dinner before the comedy show since I enjoyed the food and service last time I was here. The food wasn't the issue. I love their food here, it was the service. 
Melissa was our server and she was extremely rude to my friends. She had an attitude the entire time but tried to almost down play it as if she wasn't being rude. She told my friend to look at the menu when he asked what was on tap...RUDE. 1. You are a server, so it is your job to answer questions. 2. It took him more time to read through the menu, when you could of easily told him...
Secondly, she brought over two different salsas so we asked her which one she liked better..normal question right?? Guess not, because her respond was \"figure it out\" and she walked away. Lastly, each couple (3 couples) ordered 3 different appetizers. One for each couple. She decided to split The Trio two of us ordered with another couple and charge them $8 for something they did NOT order. They ordered their own appetizer so for her to go out of her way to do something no one asked her to do was irritating. We didn't have time to go back and forth with her so they paid anyways but the point is they paid for something they didn't touch. 
I'm bummed that my friends didn't get to have a good experience and I brought them here to celebrate my birthday. 
Oh and not to mention another guy who was bringing a beer to our table spilled the beer all over my friends arm and didn't even apologize!!!!! Clearly, they have no manners. 

The diablo shrimp tacos are delicious though and I do recommend them, but not the server."}
{"text":"Highly recomend!  Service and food was amazing!!! The tacos and drinks were delicious!  Everyone was so nice and on their game!! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Had some of the best el pastor tacos that I've ever had. Could be the homemade tortillas, or could be fate. I'm sure everything else on the menu is delicious, but definitely go for the Tomahawk for two. The 40 oz. ribeye bone makes a great gift to bring home to your furry friend after they've been waiting anxiously for your dinner date to come to an end."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, will come again. Not sure how there are reviews saying the food is \"disgusting\". It is far from disgusting. Yelp sucks but this place is great"}
{"text":"Wow, what an awesome addition to City Scape! The food, drinks, and service were all incredible. My coworker had a food allergy and the staff was beyond accomodating for us. Peter was beyond attentive and helpful. I definitely recommend stopping by the next time you're downtown!"}
{"text":"Had tacos and beer while visiting Phoenix and was pleasantly surprised how delicious everything was."}
{"text":"I've come here several times with large groups or just me and my two little kids. We always make a reservation just in case because this place gets busy! The food is delicious, the servers are friendly and the atmosphere is very creative. I would recommend it to anyone for a special occasion or just a family night out."}
{"text":"Great food terrible service. Our server was rude and unprofessional, he acted like he didn't want to be at work was actually kind of a smart you know what too."}
{"text":"I so want this place to be a success. It is a locally owned restaurant and great service. 

What is holding me back is the value for the money. 2 tacos and one ceviche were $25.00 with only water ($30.00 with tip) and the food was ok but,in a town with so many taco choices, it did not stand out. 

I hope the owners read all the yelp reviews and make some adjustments as I would rather support local."}
{"text":"3 for $10 tacos at lunch is LIFE! At dinner order the Scallops and thank me later. The service is great and you can't go wrong with a Margarita. Plus they have fresher squeezed EVERYTHING! With a great atmosphere and convenient location at City Scape it's the best place to check out Downtown."}
{"text":"My friend and I chose Chico Malo for lunch last Saturday, and we're glad we did. 

The service was great. He approached us and asked if we had been there before. After we said no, he welcomed us by walking us through the menu, highlighting some of his favorite things, and asking if we wanted something to drink. He is knowledgeable about the food items and drinks. 

We shared a chip and salsa to start and then split the chicken tinga ahogada torta The two things together were enough to kill the hunger. The drinks were also good. The loma bonita is pretty strong with the housemade tequila. The paraiso tropical is refreshing because it's a cava-base. We also briefly tried the alebrije, but it was too smokey for us (which the waiter did describe). The chicken torta was definitely the star of the meal. It was flavorful, and the \"smoked english pea guac\" just worked. Strange, but it was really good. 

I haven't been to many places around cityscape, but I wouldn't mind coming back!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to try the long awaited Chico Malo. We came before the lunch rush to ensure a good experience. I was disappointed with the salsa-- it was so sweet and had a punch on the end- not in a good way. The Elote was good, but expected more than a $7 ear of corn. Tiny street tacos range from $5-6 per. We each had one. They were okay.... but would need at least 3 to be considered a meal portion. I'm not trying to pay $30 for lunch on the regular. We will stick to our tried and true."}
{"text":"A great new place. Quality is written all over this restaurant. From the start, quality chips and fresh salsa. Followed by table side guacamole, that was great! Finished with the duck carnitas and Pollo tinga tacos. They were both great. Give this place a try, it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"The chimichanga and the green chili chicken were both amazing. The elote was a great side dish and the bread pudding to finish it off was delicious. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointing.

This place received so much hype prior to opening and it severely under delivered.

The food is less than great and way too expensive for what it is.  For starters, $5 for mediocre tacos, $12 for a Pastor torta that doesn't really taste like Pastor, and $5 for a Mexican Coke.  I mean, c'mon.  This place demands a price on its menu that is not worth the quality (or lack thereof) that they deliver.  Just the food quality and price warrants never visiting this place again.

Service: Here is the real deal breaker.  A group of 10 friends and I decided to go here for lunch.  We made a reservation and were sat promptly.  Everything else that followed was a disaster.  Food came out out of order and not complete.  One of the people in our group received 1 taco before the waiter informed us that the rest of their order was lost in between the table and sending it into the kitchen.  This happened to 3 people in our group.  The end result was that some of us received our food close to 45 minutes before other received theirs.  After the mass confusion regarding the food order, the checks were incorrect and had to be corrected multiple times before we received our correct bills.

This place looks nice and the owners clearly invested a lot of money in the place.  However, that is the extent of nice things that I can say about Chico Malo.  The food is not memorable and the service was absolutely awful.  Our group of 10 unanimously decided that this place will not get a revisit (in addition to 5 other co-workers that visited just a few days before)."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the new place...nice atmosphere but extremely overpriced for the quality of the food and service.  Don't waste your time!  Went here for lunch with friends and kinda shocked by the $4 price for tea $10 guacamole that was bland and $6 for a side of beans.  Keep the Scottsdale prices in Scottsdale unless you are bringing your A-game"}
{"text":"Wow! What a surprise. Heard about this place from a friend. Decided to make the drive downtown, and boy was it worth it. One of the most unique recipes I have the opportunity to enjoy. From the appetizers to the entrees everything was just great. Our server Krystal was amazing assisting us through the menu and her service was top notch. Food portions are super generous (already think about my leftovers). Looking for something different? Chico Malo is a must try."}
{"text":"Pass on this restaurant. Many other options for good Mexican in the area... Food is decent; inventive menu with appealing mix of flavors.  Service however, especially at the outside bar is weak.  The hipster bartenders are more interested in talking about their bro-talk than taking care of their customers. Underwhelming is an overstatement. What is the appropriate number of times for a server/ bartender to pass by their customers before they ask for their order? Or if you need anything else?"}
{"text":"What a fantastic addition to downtown Phoenix! I was there recently for business and had a four night stay in downtown. A chance meeting with Zach from Chico Malo at a bar changed the monotony of eating at the hotel. On my last night in town I tried Chico Malo, and it was sensational.

The food was inventive and well prepared. Shrimp ceviche was unique, fresh and fantastic. The Prime flat iron was the best beef I'd had all week! Cocktails are also a big part of the formula at Chico Malo with an extensive list of tequilas and very knowledgeable bartenders. 

There was a lively crowd and the music was great, but not overpowering. I can't say enough, other than I'm so happy to have another option in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The higher price was worth it. Authentic dishes done up in style. Friendly and informative waiter. Great experience!"}
{"text":"These guys got some poor reviews when they opened, but they seem to have gotten it together.  Food was excellent.  Diablo shrimp tacos had some heat to them, but not crazy.  They were somewhat small, but the server told us, so we got some rice with them that was also very good.  Kitchen was a little slow, but the server apologized and kept us informed.  All in all, a really nice meal ... we will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. We loved your server and all the house made/ authentic Hispanic cuisine. If your ever in downtown Phoenix. AZ you would do yourself a disservice if you didn't come here and eat. Plus the drinks are awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Simply scrumptious. Get the table-side guac and elote for appetizers - best elote I've ever eaten. We tried 6 different tacos...all off-the-chain. Green salsa is a home run. Service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"Fun place... good service, although we were looking for more of a Tapas place - Chico Malo doesn't necessarily have a menu meant for that. Service was good, we had a guy named Jared who took some pics of our group and was totally awesome with applying filters... and actually sold us on what's called \"La Calavera\" which is a drink for 4, by saying it's totally perfect for Instagram - ha! With regards to the food, it was good although it's not exactly traditionally prepared. The value was ok... it's location sorta implies that it'll be spendy, and I would say that that was true. I would make the recommendation... if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Incredible service, excellent brunch options. Decor was creative and fit right in with the downtown Phoenix vibe. If they have to replace the Corner with something, this is an awesome switch!"}
{"text":"Come the fuck on.

After experiencing the trash heap of disappointment that was Taco Guild earlier in the day, my wife and I went and drank our sorrows away around town, depressed that we didn't get a decent taco in a city filled with amazing tacos.  While drinking, we met a man who said he tended bar at Chico Malo, and told him about how shitty Taco Guild was.  He agreed and told us to go to Chico Malo and try it, that we wouldn't be disappointed, that they make amazing tacos the right way, tacos that will blow your mind.

After a few hours we had worked up a hunger and said \"Screw it. Let's go get some better tacos.\"

The space is nice and open, indoor/outdoor bar is long and accommodating, it just feels more accessible than when it was The Corner.  We had some hopes because it was obvious the owners spent money on this joint.  

We ordered 3 tacos, I think it was the chicken tinga, the chorizo y papas and the crispy avocado.  They came out after a while on fresh made corn tortillas!  Then I went to take a bite of the chicken tinga...but first I had to remove the dill fronds from the top.  Seriously.  They put dill fronds on a taco.

Then I was mad.  It was sweet.  SWEET.  What the shit?  Ok, I thought, at least I ordered chorizo and potatoes, there's no way to fuck that up with sweetness.  I had had enough sweet bullshit tacos at Taco Guild, I needed something savory for once.  I don't know what the hell it is with these pseudo-taco places obviously pandering to white people, but they seem to believe that white people want nothing but sweet food.  White people, I don't know if that's true about you or not, but according to Taco Guild and Chico Malo, you're basically pure sugar.

Anyway, I bit into the chorizo y papa taco!  

IT'S SWEET.   Turns out they have a \"jalapeno marmalade\".  Because yeah, that's exactly what the perfect combination of chorizo and potato was missing:  marmalade.  You motherfuckers.

The crispy avocado taco was probably the best one but even that was kind of overloaded with cucumber, maybe more of a personal preference, but even without that it would have been completely forgettable.

I left this place in a hurry, mad and upset that I broke the cardinal taco rule TWICE in one day:  the nicer the place, the shittier the taco.

PS: These mofos have a carne asada taco with ENGLISH PEA GUACAMOLE.  God damnit.  Seriously, fuck you.  Why not just go buttfuck my dead grandmother in the grave with more of your jalapeno marmalade while you're out desecrating hispanic things?  

But I'm still nice and gave two stars because it's a nice place!  But I still hate you and your tacos, Chico Malo.   

PPS:  The tacos are $5 a piece.  I'm not cheap either, so I usually don't give a shit if something is higher priced than it should be so long as I'm getting something fantastic for that price.  Instead I got trash heap fusion food from some dickbag conglomerate of corporate food-thinkers that probably cobbled this menu together from a list of foodie buzzwords and kitschy trend-aggregator instagram accounts or something.  

Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Maybe Squid Ink Sushi being closed wasn't a bad thing after all.

Having binged out on tacos a mere two days ago (Tacotopia!), I wasn't sure I was ready to partake in tacos. But I did, and it was a good decision.

Ordered the tradito tuna and a flight of tacos (we do that in California), which consisted of duck carnitas, polla tinga, and crispy avocado. They are street taco size (fit in your hand), but they loaded a sizeable portion of filling in each one. Also sipped on a glass of house red , which was described as a cab blend coming off close to a pinot. And we all know how I get around pinots...

The crispy avocado was a fried/tempura avocado slice on a bed of red cabbage. It was different, but nothing to write home about.

The pollo tinga was tasty; loaded such that it broke my tortilla.

The DUCK CARNITAS is what you want. Man, so good, I thought I ordered the short rib by mistake! I could've eaten another one, but body said, \"No, that's enough calories for today.\"

Three tacos will hit the spot for you, unless you come in über hungry. I'll be back tomorrow to try their Bad Boy Brew (cold brew & horchata)!"}
{"text":"I like finding new restaurants to eat at. The food was actually pretty really good and so was the service in my opinion. I remember we had a server who's name was Anahi. She was super nice and courteous. I would recommend others asking for her. I honestly am looking forward to eating their again because of the food and service!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure i understand the negative reviews here. The food was very tasty and high quality. Yes, it isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for. If you like inventive high quality food, then eat here."}
{"text":"Chico malo is the best, yelp is the worst. This is the BEST white people-Mexican food you will find in Phoenix. Can't remember her name but the sweetest blonde girl serves us!! EAT HERE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT I PROMISE. So good and the service was amaaaaaayyyyziiinnnnggggggggggggg"}
{"text":"A couple of days ago I ate here for the first. I'd have to say I was extremely disappointed with my experience. I work at a local hotel at the front desk, and I always recommend my guests here. If they are receiving the same experience as I did, I am very embarrassed. My servers name was Andre. After sitting for about 10 minutes without being greeted, he brings us water, and as he was pouring it into our glasses he was engaging with the table next to us. Our food was then brought by someone else and I only saw Andre two times after that and once was for the check. The food was excellent, and I really wished the service would have matched."}
{"text":"The food was very bland and not very flavorful. You really missed the point of what Mexican food is! I was surprised there was so many people there. I will never go back, too many other places that are better then this place."}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant was eye catching! Very nice dinning and seating, big fan of the open kitchen and artwork! The service was great and fast. My fiance and I went to have a early dinner we had a total of 6 tacos and a appetizer. Crispy avacodo, Baja fish, Pastor, Chicken Tinga, and papas and chorizo were amaizing, the only one I didn't like was the Carne Asada taco. The taco had great toppings and all blended well, my favorite thing to do when I have tacos is tak a piece of the protein and taste it, always done that. In this case the Carne Asada was bland no taste seemed like no seasoning (nope not even salt and pepper) seems like they wanted to mask the bland beef with all the ingredients in the taco but didn't end up working out. The chorizo con Papas appetizer was really good but prefer it as a taco instead. Overall a great place to have dinner and drinks! Recommended!"}
{"text":"I dig the vibe of this place! Been a few times and have not been disappointed with the food! Guacamole is delicious and a must order! If you wanna splurge, the scallops are bomb! Taco plates are tasty, but small, and that's all you get is tacos. Sides are extra. Staff has always been attentive and nice!"}
{"text":"Such Guc-a-love. 

So I see this place across from my Hotel. It's Phoenix, they gotta have good Mexican.  Chico is a nouveau Mexican style place.  I take a chance, ironically the name of my waiter, such a fun, happy, go lucky guy whom lived up to his name and walked away with a 25% tip for great service.  You sold this place man, and there was a dedication. Now to warm you... this isn't your hole in the wall taco place and it isn't cheap... but well worth it. 

So I got the guac.. my tableside experience consisted of a more traditional and the a modern and sweeter guac.  I saw another review whom hated the sweet aspect. It's different then traditional but a journey you should take.  If nouveau Mexican is sweet... viva la Mexico!!! 

I rounded that off with a ceviche, also sweet with watermelon and the duck taco with a mole sauce.   All good.  An expensive $5 taco for sure, but full of flavor, well put together, and worth the price. 

Dessert was a chili / pineapple / strawberry custard. Beautiful presentation and great taste. Spice at the dessert menu is a new thing for me, but fun
And exciting, like breakfast for dinner or rock climbing.   Downed this with a prickly pear iced tea that I promptly spilled all over the table... the second glass was good though.  

Overall... great food, caring and dedicated service invested in your dining experience, and a good night.  4 stars because I had so little of the menu.  Knocking out a few more tacos and I'll be up to 5."}
{"text":"Best parts: decor and service! Decor is very cool and on trend. The back wall has a very awesome painting on books. Server was great. Unfortunately I don't recall his name but he had a sweet Aaliyah sweatshirt on. The food was good, but in an area with a lot of great Mexican food it just didn't compare. Guacamole and salsa were tasty. I had the al pastor tacos and the SO had green chili chicken. They were both tasty, just not exciting. I think I would definitely head back to hang out and have drinks but probably not for a meal."}
{"text":"Thumbs up. Absolutely love this place! I love the hand made tortillas and queso fundido. The Mexico City enchiladas are my fave!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Great out door patio and bar area. Great draft selection and delicious good. Cool atmosphere. Friendly and helpful bartender. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really, really terrible service. There were 2-3 bartenders for a Saturday night, but they were talking with each other or wait staff the whole time. Right next to us. While ignoring us. We sat at least  5 minutes before even getting our drink orders. Then forever before getting checked on - so didn't try for food. There were maybe 3 other couples at the bar and the restaurant was literally empty! It almost felt like the staff was taking a break and we were invisible. We were there about an hour and only had a drink each because we were waiting for service (or our bill) the whole time. Really disappointing.

Atmosphere and design of the restaurant are really great- hence the 2 stars :)"}
{"text":"Amazing brand new urban Mexican food restaurant  in the heart of downtown Phoenix at CityScape. There's not many Mexican food places in the area, so Chico Malo has the market and any other that tries to challenge will have hard time beating them. This new restaurant is amazing. The atmosphere and ambience is incredible and mind blowing with art installations and large murals that graffiti the walls. It has a bar, lounge dining room, and patio seating. Everything is made in house and rom scratch including their chips, tortillas, roja, verde, and signature Montezuma salsa that I would describe as if salsa and hummus had a baby. The food is delicious and a flavorful explosion. They put a great twist on some timeless Mexican traditional dishes and serve a variety of street tacos from duck carnitas to pork belly and chicken tinga that all complements well with their cocktail list that puts a spin on tequila and margaritas. They even have a tableside guacamole cart that is made fresh right in front of you. The staff and waiters are very friendly and upbeat and knowledge about the menu and what flavors to expect from the food as well as the cocktails. They are open for quick grab and go breakfast items as well as stout a quick lunch service to grab some tacos on your lunch hour and a sit down dining experience for dinner time. A burrito cart is slated to be up and running shortly too that will most likely cater to the after hours night life scene of downtown. This new restaurant is a must if you are downtown. Whether you are out to lunch or heading to a game, concert, or comedy show."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Slow service. Tiny $5 tacos.  $4 iced tea.  $3 chips and bland salsa-- no free refills.  No rice.  Food is mediocre and rage inducing in its tiny-ness. This place is dead to us."}
{"text":"My life problem with coming here was that I wanted traditional Mexican food, but I was walking around at 2:30pm, which is closing time for many Mom-and-pop Mexicans places in downtown. I eventually made my way to Chico Malo with my friend and had a solid experience.

The restaurant is located in the CityScape, so it has a decent amount of competition bringing people in. Therefore, we had no problems getting two spots in the outdoor section of the bar. 

I insisted upon starting off with guac, but my friend hates it. (I know I know...I low key hate him for his disdain of avocados, but I digress.) we ended up getting the trip, which included the bean salad and salsa as well as the guac. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavors and the presentation of the drip trio - if you have read my review of Lachey's in Cincinnati, you know my bad luck regarding dip trios. I munched hard on the dip trio here, and I was having a lot of fun mixing and matching the different dips. They complement each other well and are great starters for your entrees.

We were happy to hear that they were still serving brunch options until 3, so we both opted for items off of that menu. I ordered Chile Rellenos while my friend ordered the eggs Benedict. My Rellenos came out HUGE. It was just a massive amount of food. Unfortunately, soggy chips do not make great leftovers and I found the verde to be rather flavorless. Luckily I had salsa and guac left to help me eat. My friend thoroughly enjoyed his eggs Benedict and it was actually a normal eating amount, so ya know, I was happy for him.

All in all, a solid option in downtown Phoenix, but if the choice arises, maybe get some authentic tacos elsewhere first."}
{"text":"Exceptional! From the cocktails and horchata to house made chips and delicious salsas to the table side guacamole service to the tacos to tres leches everything is here is fresh and delicious. The flavor combinations add depth and complexity to traditional Mexican dishes. The al pastor is juicy, flavorful and amazing, the carne asada is perfectly cooked and seasoned and the baja fish was moist inside and crispy on the outside just as it should be. A friend orderd Tres Leches for the table which I thought I was too full to eat...until the waiter brought it out and it looked too good to pass up. Save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Wow!   The food is incredible. Great happy hour specials.  Definitely recommend checking them out, not your typical Mexican fare..."}
{"text":"I usually don't leave multiple reviews for the same place, but every time I go here I just feel compelled to share how great this place is! The atmosphere is lively and fun, the service is always on point, and the food/drinks are always delicious  

Try the mango margaritas and the Mexico City quesadillas. Oh and the elote is one of my favorites. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Okay so I don't usually do this... but holy balls Chico malo has the most amazingly flavorful food. Their elote is the most amazing thing I've ever eaten. All of their dishes are so beautiful and packed full of depth and spice. From the moment you walk into the restaurant, there is such a relaxed feel, their eclectic decor and indoor outdoor open concept layout  is so laid back and welcoming. You can truly feel the love and passion they have invested. Hector, grant and Pete were taking care of me and my friend and they were so knowledgeable and friendly. That was literally the cherry on the cake for us. Phenomenal across the board. So happy to have found my go to Latin restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I was seated at 5:15pm this evening and given water... 5:30 rolls around and no one has come my way to take my order, let alone glance my way to at least wave them down. Around 5:35 a couple is seated near me, beverage AND food order taken, I thought for sure I was the next stop for the waitress and had maybe just been missed... and I was wrong. I finally walked out at 5:45, water and menu on the table, and thanked the hostess for at least seating me. Definitely won't bother attempting this one again.

Back to the drawing board..."}
{"text":"Chico Malo is my bitch. Ivey is the tits and also has some really nice ones. My review is too short to be left as a review so the rest of these words are invaluable. Regardless, come check this place out. The food is  and the bartender is ."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour and absolutely LOVED it. The margaritas are delicious and strong, the HH appetizers are unique but amazing and the overall atmosphere is very cool. I can't wait to come back for another HH and I hope this business does really well."}
{"text":"This was located very conveniently to a hotel we were staying out and we decided to check it out for lunch. Our waiter was awesome and friendly. He was ready to answer our questions and offer suggestions. This is upscale Mexican food. The decor is so great and the place is very open and spacious. They have only been open for 4 months but looks like they have it together. We ordered guacamole, different types of tacos and the coconut rice (so so good). I also tried their mezcal margarita and it was excellent!"}
{"text":"Chico Malo did not disappoint. The atmosphere fits perfectly in downtown phx, beautifully planned from the murals and lighting to the servingware. Service was phenomenal. The staff were personable, attentive, and swift with our orders, food, and check. I love when a restaurant makes you feel at home! As two hungry guests, we first ordered beer (it was cold!), and the guacamole (a fun novelty, and substantial portion made from 2 whole large avocados) which was brought out with salsa and warm chips and were refilled for free later during the visit. Next came the puerco beans and 3 tacos which were served on freshly made 4-5\" tortillas: The al pastor, pollo tinga, and chorizo y papas. I personally loved the unique touches on each taco...jalapeno marmalade, egg crema, pineapple...which I felt matched the artfulness of the atmosphere and the eye-catching menu design. The flavors of each were fantastic and we left with a completely quenched appetite. Would return!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this new place in the downtown area. HUGE disappointment. I cant tell u one thing about how the food tastes, as we left before even speaking to a server. We were seated and 10-15 minutes later, noone came to wait on us. I mean not even a hello or a drink order. We saw tables seated after us were being served. It was like we didnt exist. It was infuriating. I was not impressed with the prices either. I got the chance to memorize that damn menu for as long as I sat. $5 minimum for a (as in 1) \"taco\"? No thanks. The menu prices were outrageous and the service was god awful. NEVER again!!!!"}
{"text":"Quality food and service!! I had always heard great things about this place and I'm glad I finally came in to check it out. The server was really knowledgeable and helped guide me through the menu. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The drinks, food, and service here were all great. Disappointing to see the low reviews, but it seems like most people are commenting on how it was overpriced. Yes it's a little pricey, but this is something you should check out before you go to a place. Sometimes unique recipes and quality ingredients result in higher prices. I had a duck carnitas with candied pecans and pickled red onions. It was not tiny, contrary to what most people are saying, very tasty, and where else can you get duck carnitas?? 
Also, had two mezcal drinks with charcoal that were strong--pretty much all booze--for $10 each. Pretty standard for a cocktail that is all liquor. Also, the montezuma salsa some of the best salsa I've had in my life, if not the best. Also, the server was dope. I will concede that the guac is objectively overpriced (but still delicious) and was not completely stoked on the chorizo taco. People are haters."}
{"text":"Food is good, but portions are too small for their price. I ordered two tacos and an appetizer to split with another person and was still really hungry. $5/taco with $12 app (basically 3 small tacos)"}
{"text":"Everything at Chico Malo is amazing! From the fresh made chips and salsa all the way to the dessert! This is a modern take on Mexican food that you will not find at any other place here in Phoenix. They have a house made grapefruit soda that they put in their Loma Bonita and it is to die for. (I had 3 ;))

Apps: The Nichie Nachos - Creamy and cheesy, TO DIE FOR! The Pork Belly Tostada had an egg cream that complimented the black bean puree. 

You must get the Puerco beans to compliment your tacos. 

I've been to Chico Malo a few times so I've tried almost all the tacos they offer. My favorite is the pork belly! Its spicy and sweet. 

If you are going for dinner I would suggest the Layered Pollo Fundido that comes with a braised chicken leg on the side or the Chile Ribeye that melts in your mouth. 

Finally, are the desserts!!! I ordered the Pineapple Chili Panna Cotta and my husband ordered the Tres Leches Rice pudding. Both were outstanding. I cannot wait to go back and try some of their salads at lunch. Till next time!"}
{"text":"Very cool ambience. Love the decor and the name. I'm from Texas so I was apprehensive about ordering the chicken mole. Although it is cooked very differently than home, it was delicious. Chicken was tender and the flavor was great. This is a unique type of restaurant with the different ingredients in the plates and tacos but very well put together. I had the  corn and beans, both exceptional."}
{"text":"Super delicious, especially the Duck Tamale. That mole sauce was one of the better ones I've had. The tacos were good, but surprisingly not the highlight. Ask for Elote for sure!
Food: 8/10 (The highlight for sure!)
Service: 7/10 (Friendly but kinda weird)
Ambiance: 6/10 (Music was amazing but they didn't ask us if we wanted to sit indoors or outdoors, they just sat us outside). 
Cocktails: 4/10 (The Sangria and my friend's drinks were both eh)
Wait: 10/10 (No wait on a Friday evening around 8ish)

Overall a great experience and I'd be back!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed my experience at Chico Malo in the two times I've been there. We were there a few weeks ago on a Saturday night and ordered a whole bottle of tequila and had a wonderful time. 

We started our night out with traditional guacamole and queso fundido which were both delicious. I had the elote and it was delicious as well. I ordered the tijuana caesar for my main dish and it was definitely not what I expected - they bring you a whole romaine lettuce. It was unique and I enjoyed it. I liked the vibe of Chico Malo and the service was good. The price point was on par with other restaurants in downtown Phoenix. The location was prime. You can pop in for good food and a few drinks and make your way out to the bars close by. I will definitely be back for drinks and tacos."}
{"text":"Amazing food! 
We had the AL PASTOR, CARNE ASADA, BAJA FISH, AND POLLO TINGA tacos. Probably better than most tacos in Mexico! Kudos to the chef! 
Great vibe and atmosphere. Can't believe this place has only been here 3 months!
Awesome staff! Mario was our server and we will be asking for him each time!
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very tasty. Kind of stumbled upon this place after it took over the venue.  Had a nice tour of the table plates."}
{"text":"We came during happy hour the drinks were great and appetizer were good. For lunch we had the tacos (machaca, fish, avocado) which were not bad but my husband ordered the Caesar salad and it was very weird. They give you a huge chunk of Romaine with some sauce and chicken on the side, they also given you a \"Mexican crouton\" which tasted interesting, I did not like it. I rather have regular croutons...service was good though!"}
{"text":"$4 for a tiny bottle (not a real size bottle) of Diet Coke (no refills). Mild salsa tastes like bathroom cleaning solution / has the aroma of urinal cakes. Overly expensive menu with Mexican food atrocities. Who puts pickled veggies on a taco? Gross. 

The carne asada meat was good, the tortilla was good. But stale chips and everything else that makes Mexican food good is missing. Sorry guys, not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"Had a work party so it was a set menu. I ordered the chile relleno, a good vegetarian option. It was so tasty, along with rice served with it. The restaurant was also recommended by the hotel concierge. The service was very friendly, cute atmosphere, food delicious! Large cocktail menu."}
{"text":"BE AWARE THIS ISN'T MEXICAN FOOD YOUR ABUELITA WOULD MAKE.  With that warning feel free to proceed with my unbiased opinion. I went here with ZERO expectations of the type of Mexican food it would be. To start I gave it 3 stars because it is quite pricey, was the food worth it? I'm about 70% sure it was. I took my mother and aunty here for my mother's birthday. It was an early dinner, no trouble making a reservation or finding the place. We all ordered bebidas alcoholicas, at least that's what they were called on the menu. I got an alebrije, my mother got the paraiso tropical and my aunty got the sangria. I don't like the sweet stuff but they do, I loved my drink the smoky mezcal was paired perfectly with the hibiscus, lemon, ginger and basil. My mom loved her drink but she loves anything sweet and even mentioned after on FB how her drink had an exotic liqueur. My aunty said hers wasn't sweet enough the waiter was kind enough to bring her a packet of stevia and she said once that was added it was delicious. We got the tableside guac and got the standard mix but added mango, cotija cheese, pomegranates, corn and jicama. I definitely have had better guac at other places but it was nothing to complain about, still good. The chips were BOMB freshly made. I got an appetizer of mango + chile, it came with this red chile sauce and what seemed like some type of seeds and pomegranate. It was delish a nice twist on mango with chamoy. We all loved the tacos I got the short rib and duck, no complaints they were filled to the brim with ingredients and super tasty. Their mole was absolutely delicious on the short rib and duck.  I could've eaten 10 each of them but then I remembered each taco costs $5.  My mother got elote and shared it with my aunty, they love elote so there isn't much you can do to ruin it for them. The rest of the tacos ordered were the pastor, chorizo  and tinga. My mom didn't like how the chorizo had actual small circle sized potatoes she said they were too difficult to eat. Aside from that everyone including myself loved their tacos. We were too full to have dessert, I was very sad about this. The reason I gave 3 stars was ultimately the price and taco portion, for the amount of food you get you are paying a pretty penny. $5 for one small ish sized taco is A LOT. If you just order two tacos they would be more of an appetizer then a meal and I'm being generous when I say that. I get that these aren't your run of the mill tacos but if that's the case then my taste buds need to be blown away and not just reading fancy descriptions that blow me away.  Ambience is AMAZING. Waiter was PHENOMENAL. I happily paid for our near $100 meal and tipped the waiter a little over 20%. I think it's worth a try if you have an open mind and like to try new things.  Also next time I might try an entree.  People remember, this place is new so keep in mind they may have some kinks to work out. I most definitely think that it is better then 1 or 2 stars.  Maybe those low raters were expecting my grandmas chorizo tacos and believe me you're not going to find those here."}
{"text":"Delicious small bite tacos, amazing salads with so much flavor and the drinks are spot on. We would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The staff is 5+ for me. Amazing service. The manager personally assisted me and made recommendations for vegan options, then seated me himself. The hostess was delightful and pleasant. My waiter was attentive and everyone was accommodating and kind. The food was tasty. I just don't prefer to be charged for every single thing I eat separately. Like my tortillas."}
{"text":"First time here. Our sever Mario suggested the Loma Bonita and the Pork Verde. He also suggested the many dipping sauces for our chips.  He took his word and ordered everything.  It was delicious! Good drinks,  good food, good music and excellent service.  The guy that made us our table side gauc was very friendly and professional.  Mario our server was awesome. Definitely recommend him when you come in. He knew the menu and was always there when we needed something or had a question.  I will come back soon and try other entres."}
{"text":"Warm beer. Enough said. 

Chico malo is probably no bueno. I say probably because I didn't try a single other thing.  I was way too offended by the warm beer.  Call me sensitive."}
{"text":"Cool setup. Drinks are disgusting!  the prices for their shit food is a joke! By far one of the worst \"mexican\" restaurant in phx!  AVOID this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos! Don't expect a mom and pop Mexican place. It's chef-driven with high-quality ingredients. The tacos range from the more traditional carne asada to forward-thinking duck. Happy hour every day, including weekends, from 3-6. The margaritas are perfect-- not too sweet and can't be beat for $5 on HH. Plus, they have nice selection of beer. The staff was friendly, professional and offered great suggestions throughout our meal. I highly recommend Chico Malo for a great Mexican spot downtown."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch today and had a great experience!  The tacos were so amazingly delicious...already dreaming about the green chile pork taco (it was truly that good!)!  I also tried the al pastor and the chicken tinga...both flavorful, fresh and downright tasty too.  We'll definitely be back for more amazing tacos!"}
{"text":"Meh. Sounds exciting but isn't. Sorry. I tired. Cheese was so solidified food was way overrated and pretty pricey. I'm going to Gallo Blanco. Ten thousand time better."}
{"text":"Excellent, and delicious.
In my second visit I'm now certain this is how food tastes in heaven.  Melissa, thanks for your great service this evening..."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a much overdue and needed weekend of MLB - my Nationals are in town and it's a quick trip down here to see them from my new hometown of Las Vegas.  Without vehicle and not wanting to spend a fortune on transportation I've been eating downtown. So far nothing has been particularly outstanding and I'd kinda given up. Chico Malo was close by and I figured I'd give it a try. 

First - you have to start with the service which got the experience started off on the right foot.  I sat at the bar outside and was immediately greeted with a big smile and hello from Joe. He introduced the other bartender and let me know that either one of them could help me with anything.  Sometimes traveling solo you don't feel particularly welcome eating solo at the bar - but this guy was super friendly and welcoming. 

I was offered a cold beer or a drink.  It's Sunday brunch so I felt obligated to get at least one mimosa - which was made with fresh squeezed orange juice. I also ordered the trio - a bean ceviche, red salsa, and guacamole. At $12 it's a little pricey considering one of the 3 bowls is salsa and frequently Mexican restaurants include chips and salsa for free, but the bean ceviche was really tasty and I didn't need any salt for the guacamole (which is pretty rare for me).  

While eating my appetizer I was asked if I had any questions about the menu - which I did - and Joe answered them all confidently and helped steer me to the Chingon Burrito.  My drink was also empty and I decided to switch to a sangria.  I was offered white or red - complete with a description of both so I didn't order one I would t like. Ended up with the white - made with pineapple and fresh mint - which was perfectly refreshing for the warm Phoenix weather. 

Now for the food:  You have to admire a menu item that announces its fantastic-ness in its own name - The Chingon Burrito. Filled with what must be multiple pounds of carne asada, ham, bacon, and cheddar cheese, this burrito is then topped with 2 eggs and it is definitely Chingon!  Served with perfectly seasoned puerco beans and fingerling potatoes this is a meal that will feed any appetite.  No one will ever leave here hungry.  Ever. 

There was one small problem with my burrito - I asked for over medium eggs instead of sunny side up but I got two eggs fried totally hard.  Someday I'll learn to trust the chef, but in the meantime sunny side up eggs kinda gross me out. In all fairness, the place only serves brunch on Sunday so there's not a lot of practice with eggs and it's not as easy as everyone thinks. You might think this would cause a 1 star-deduction, but the service more than made up for it.  Within 2 bites the guys were over to check on my food.  I showed them the eggs and before I knew it fresh over-medium eggs were delivered.  Great service, quick follow up, and a proper recook are all anyone can ask for because no one is perfect. For these reasons - no star penalties will be issued. 

Some general comments:  
- everything tasted good and it's the first meal I've had in town where the hot food was actually hot.  Thank you!
- no salt and pepper on the tables or bar because it's not needed.  Even the over easy eggs are perfectly seasoned with a little salt and cracked black pepper prior to service.  You have to appreciate a kitchen with confidence.
- the burrito is enough food for two or three people; pace yourself because it tastes so good you're going to want to try and keep eating. 
- the place is comfortable - cool decor without being overly pretentious 
- I also like to observe others in my reviews and see a lot of happy people enjoying their food. I can't speak for these folks, but seeing them all reinforces my experience. 

My final analysis:  great experience and great food. I will definitely be back here when my travels bring me to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great, authentic tasting Mexican food! I had the Short Rib and it was delicious. Everybody in our party loved their meals so it's safe to say the whole menu is pretty solid. Definitely indulge in the chips and dip too. The red one is nice and spicy! Oh, how can I forget the margaritas. They come highly recommended and they were pretty decent. I say decent because I like my margaritas a bit on the stronger side. The service was awesome and our waitress was nice and personable. I'd definitely recommend stopping by Chico Malo for a bite. It's a great spot for casual dining with a group or a chill date night.

They will validate your parking as well."}
{"text":"I liked it. Good service, very good food. Nice atmosphere, the patio was just very pleasant. Our server was very nice and accommodating. Nice modern spin on goos mexican food"}
{"text":"I believe I'll be able to return and give it 5 stars. 
But I didn't have much time to taste my food at our visit this week.

Our preferred res. time wasn't open but 15 min later was, so we took that one but arrived and made it as clear as possible we had theater tickets and needed to order drinks/app/dinner at once so we could be on time. About 45 min later food arrived, at this point we'd already settled checks. We shoveled a few bites in and started getting up from the table.

The manager came over before we left, he reversed the charges on our cards, sincerely apologized for the kitchen delay and that is why we will return, and take our time to enjoy the food. The bites I had of the Whole fish were delicious. 
The white sangria was good, better than my friends red sangria I thought. And the guacamole we had as appetizer was awesome. 

Our waitress was fantastic and sweet."}
{"text":"Wow. Probably the worst place I have been downtown. The glasses had lipstick on them, the queso was cold and hard....twice.  the chips cold and stale, the tortillas cold and tasteless. 
Lots of hype and no taste. Would pass and never return.  Sweet and friendly bartender is only plus here. 
Water was even dirty tasting.
Neat, funky atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here for the heavenly Duck Tamale, stayed here for the Tacos AL Pastor and delicious home made corn tortillas. Excellent service and atmosphere. Preferably get a reservation because this place fills up fast."}
{"text":"Different exclusive ingredients create a delicious flavorful experience. Through out the restaurant I found delightful artwork that followed traditional south of the border lines and shapes as well as new age art defining this place as hip as well as traditional. The food is made with creativity and love allowing your palette too experience an explosion. I love the cocktails the chicorita made with vanilla Simple is just that simple and delicious. The duck confit taco is unheard of and out of this world made with a cherry walnut mole sauce a must have. The chips and salsa rojo or verde are savory and not overbearing in spice made with just enough  kick to pair it with the bomb table side guac where you can choose everything from pomegranate bananas to keeping it basic cilantro and limes can be used the options are endless."}
{"text":"If you are in the downtown Phoenix area, check out Chico Malo. I had the chimichanga and thought I had a good taste full of flavor and good size chunks of chicken. The price is a little on the high side, so bring a little extra cash. To me their salsa tasted plain and the guacamole had a good taste but needed more salt. I will go back soon and I will update you guys on whether my initial thoughts are on solid ground. Chow!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the concept. So good for downtown. I enjoyed all the food but it's just too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for opening night, as it's been a highly anticipated restaurant to open in the downtown Phoenix scene. The décor and environment compliments the artistic scene of downtown Phoenix, yet they stand apart from other Mexican restaurants in the valley. 
I went with a large group of friends, so we can all taste the different variety of options. Drink selection was okay. I was expecting more. 

To start, we ordered the guacamole, and it did not really have any flavor. We even added chicharones and bananas, but there was something missing that we couldn't pin-point. It just tasted like an avocado-banana smoothie. The guac came with three salsas (that needed salt) and the hottest salsa was not spicy. 

I ordered the Baja Fish tacos, which I do recommend. Also, I ordered the shrimp ceviche which lacked flavor of traditional shrimp ceviche. The avocado underneath took away from the other unique fruits and veggies that were added.  I want to say there was more avocado then ceviche.)
We also ordered Chicken Tinga, Pastor, Carne Asada, and Duck tacos. The most popular ones among the group were the Duck and Carne asada tacos. 

Overall, the customer service experience was phenomenal, but the food did not cut it. It was honestly disappointing, because I was expecting more. I know this was the grand opening, so I will give Chico Malo a second chance :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic flavors in their tacos. The chef knows very well how to meld flavors. My wife has the shrimp chievche and was absolutely delicious. The presentation of the food was great. We have found a true gem in Chico Malo!"}
{"text":"Reading the reviews on Chico Malo is a little sad. I have already been to Chico Malo twice since their opening approximately three weeks ago. The food, staff, and drinks are all really good! The happy hour is pretty solid with $5 margaritas (which are great) and some discounted small plates. 

The first time we went, we were served by Angel (I LOVE YOU), and he was great! He gave us suggestions and our drinks were always full. The chips and salsa (verde and montezuma) are a must when starting. The montezuma salsa is a bit different, but it's excellent. I believe I have tried every taco on their menu and was not disappointed with any of them. My favorites have to be pollo tinga, chorizo and papas, and the short rib. 

I see that people are mostly complaining about the prices on the tacos. Yes, they are priced higher than tacos that you get on the street for 50 cents, however, the ingredients that Chico Malo is using are fresh and also from local businesses. The tortillas are made in house and are perfect. You are paying more for the quality of these tacos, which is totally worth it. 

Chico Malo is a great restaurant! The decor and wait staff is super nice. I'm excited to see the restaurant progress."}
{"text":"Great place and even better environment!  The food was beyond amazing and they had so many different options. If you don't like the same old Mexican restaurants and want to experience something totally different... this is the spot!!!! Thanks for the great service and excellent food:)"}
{"text":"Came back for my second time and loved it just as much. I love the patio and the downtown feel . I ate the pork belly tacos and chicken tinga taco. Once again it was really good!  Our waiter was really nice and welcoming. It's becoming my fav place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Mexican food. Enjoyed the queso & guacamole. Can you say homemade tortillas?"}
{"text":"Just not impressed. Menu is limited and over priced. Food was not that good. We were very disappointed!"}
{"text":"We had the al pastor tacos. They were very dry, the pineapple brought in some much needed moisture & sweetness but over all were lacking flavor. The margaritas were top notch."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the duck tomalley the presentation was nice and I enjoyed eating the food. Everyone in our party enjoyed their food. Many unique choices were made and each looked delicious."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was blasé, bartender was impersonal and short with us, a server had a rude comment to say about our drink inquiry when he probably shouldn't have made any comments, and the food was subpar for the Mexican genre or even Modern Mexican or Southwest Mexican genres-- gaudy dishes without any real umph. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is pretty amazing. The atmosphere is super chill and sort of hipster. The posole was fabulous! Also, I was pleasantly surprised that that it wasn't crazy busy during the week at noon. Usually downtown spots fill up fast during lunch hour. Even though it wasn't packed, the waitress was super attentive and the manager stopped by to check on everyone's table (I love that)."}
{"text":"On Easter Sunday, I was expecting huge crowds or a line for brunch and I was happy to see that there was no wait!  Woohoo!

I wanted to show my visiting guests what DT had to offer and chose this restaurant based that it was walking distance from my church.  They were visiting from CA and it was their first time in DT Phoenix.  

We were welcomed by their friendly staff at the door and seated quickly.  Our waiter went over the menu and was attentive.  We asked the waiter if he spoke Spanish since some of the menu items are Mexican dishes with a South American twist.  He politely said it was not good but was trying his hardest and my guests appreciated his efforts.  He made us feel extremely welcomed and made for a very positive experience.  We ordered the Drunken French Toast, Chilaquiles, Breakfast Quesadilla and the Simple Breakfast.  Also had appetizers and drinks!  My french toast was hard to eat.  I could eat the caramelized banana all day though, but make it a bit less complicated.  The Chilaquiles were the bomb!  Although it was not what I ordered, the green chili pork was perfect.  Everyone else was very pleased with what they ordered and the bloody Mary's kept coming!  I couldn't try everything so I'm definitely returning for more.

You know you're at the right place when you walk in and to your left is a mural art of Frida Kahlo flashing gang signs with some lucha libre.  The venue has clever decor and murals are vibrant.  Overall, we had an exceptional experience with the service and food."}
{"text":"Been there twice already. I love the space!! I've sat inside next to the tortilleria and on the patio. I had a great time both times! The food is awesome and the service was even more awesome!"}
{"text":"Modern Mexican style and atmosphere. The menu had many classics but also lots of creative dishes. I had their carne asada. The steak was more like a T-bone instead of skirt steak but was flavorful and tender. It came with some pickled beets, thinly sliced onion and tomato, guacamole, home-made tortillas, and a fantastic chimichurri sauce. The sauce really enhanced the steak and gave it an Argentinian touch. Service was good, and I left very content with my meal. If I'm back in the area, I would love to try some other items on their very original menu. Highly recommend Chico Malo."}
{"text":"Chico Malo is a solid downtown-option for Mexican food and drinks. We came on a Sunday for brunch and were pleased with the pitchers of sangria and the bottle of sparkling cava we ordered.

The food was also good. I enjoyed a chingon burrito, which had carne asada, bacon and a sunny side up egg on top. My S.O. tried the drunken french toast with the caramelized banana. Both were delish! The chips weren't my favorite -- I couldn't tell if they needed more salt or were just cooked differently, but they were ~unique~.

Chico Malo also has a great patio and when the weather permits, they open up the restaurant to have an indoor/outdoor feel."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Upscale Mexican food that is definitely not your average . The food is FRESH. Do not overload on the chips and salsa as the portions are more than adequate."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hour and sat in the outside patio bar area. It was a little hot inside but outside we had a nice breeze. Atmosphere was nice and they service was great. Food was ok but pricey for what you get. I order Al Pastor taco and it was very small for 5.00 and just ONE taco. (Waitress mentioned it was bigger han a regular street taco but it wasnt. My friend ordered Al Pastor Torta and that was 10.00 got that only. No sides. We also ordered chips and salsa. Would probably skip this place for tacos elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had several things and shared them. Service was ok, not the best attention. The food was bland. We all said either something was ok or not goood.  Nothing we get did anyone say wow.  Lots of other options downtown"}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, I have high expectations for my tacos. Based on price and portion, I was unimpressed. Don't get me wrong, the meat is okay and nothing terrible happened, but this place focuses more on aesthetics than it does on good quality. Not worth the price in my opinion."}
{"text":"We stopped here this evening before seeing a show at Stand-up Live. Never having been, we asked the server some questions and he gave us great suggestions. I have a tomato allergy (super hard to avoid at Mexican restaurants), but he had our guac made without it, and my meal had no tomatoes. 

The tacos I got were served SO beautifully, and they were delicious! My husband got the green chili chicken and loved it. Service was quick, attentive, and helpful. After our meal, the manager came over we had a great conversation, and he bought us dessert. 

We would come back here for dinner in a heartbeat. Their unique menu, fun atmosphere, and quick, friendly service are worth returning for."}
{"text":"Sal our bartender was fantastic on our first trip, he recommended their house margs made with infused tequila, best marg I've ever had! From there it was solid the whole way thru, his recommendation of scallops and the whole fish which tonight was the snapper was also amazing. Can't say enough good things! Would highly recommend. 5 stars for service, drinks and food."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after hearing good things about it. A few coworkers and I went after an event on Thursday and had the worst experience. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant, and it took about 15mins before someone came and brought us water. Then about another 15mins before a waiter came. We had ordered some items only to be told they no longer make them. So we went ahead and order the table side guac, and few tacos, salad to share and another appetizer to try. The table side guac came and the guy making them didn't say one word to us, and the guac was bland for $14, pretty disappointed. Then our tacos came out and the entire order was wrong. We never even got our salad or other appetizer and the guy who brought us the food said the first waiter put the order in wrong. When we asked where he was he told us he had gone home. He never even came to let us know he was leaving, follow up on any drink refills, or check on how the food was. Our SECOND waiter gave us attitude after we complained and blamed the other waiter. No manager even approached us to ask how everything went and we weren't offered a discount for the mess up. Super disappointed and I DO NOT RECOMMEND. Worst service ever and good wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Teddy the restaurant manager is absolutely amazing. He has done an outstanding job with making sure our meal and entire experience is phenomenal! I strongly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a great time, amazing meal, and wonderful customer service!"}
{"text":"Margaritas have a extra-special-secret-something that make them tasty. Agave maybe? We split the rejeno. I give them snaps for reinventing the rejeno, and switching up traditional mexican dishes. Next time I'll try the pozole."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to.  Literally have eaten everything on the menu and not one thing fell short of my expectations.  Beverages are on point.  Horchata cold brew is amazing."}
{"text":"Yelp took down my 5 star review for some reason. They must have thought I was a bot or something because I had no complaints. (I also don't see my 5-star review of Welcome Diner anymore, so maybe they took that down too. Ha.) Anyway that might explain why there aren't more glowing reviews if legitimate 5 star reviews are getting pulled. Evidently opinion is divided on Chico Malo. I can only speak for myself and the four friends I went with. We ordered a ton of dishes and thought literally everything we tried was bomb. The pork verde was one of my new favorite meals, period. We also met the owners and they were super friendly, which is why I'm bothering with a review when I don't usually do that.

As a Glendale native I feel like I know my Mexican food pretty well. I grew up on Pedro's, Rosita's, and Carolina's. This stuff is a little different. Fancier, more up-market, more experimental and creative. I'd put it in a category with Gallo Blanco or Richardsons / Rokerij. Great for a date or a night out.

If it'll make Yelp happy I'll give a criticism: the menu isn't super baby-friendly, according to my friends who brought their toddler, since it's rather spicy. So if you've got a baby in tow, maybe keep that in mind. But if like me you are happy to have a higher-end option for Mexican fare and drinks downtown, I think you'll dig this place."}
{"text":"Another sad example of following Yelp reviews. First off, if you want to park, you have to find a garage because there is no parking. Luckily there is one next door but irritating if your coming downtown just for dinner. So the restaurant.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was inattentive to say the least. He was too busy twirling glasses and talking to the waitress to ever once ask if I wanted another drink, or even how my food was. The food was good, not amazing or anything special.  The establishment was clean but nothing to write home about. The $11.00 Margarita was in a small glass and tasted terrible so I ordered a coke. Which came in a bottle. You even had to pay for chips and salsa. No rice or beans with my meal either. Upsell, upsell, upsell, at every corner. If you like expensively overpriced tacos, bad service, no parking, and crappy drinks this might be your spot. For me, I won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"Not to bad, but if you know ceviche don't order it here. Tacos were flavorful, didn't have layers of flavor but still good. Pozole was okay, lots of meat and good flavors. The music was fun, I'll probably be back"}
{"text":"It was hot outside today, so the AC and the cold water made everything better... but then it just made us happier and happier!!!  Even though there was an event downtown tonight, Chico Malo got us a table quickly!  We started with white sangria (holy yum!!) and then moved on to margaritas and the Paloma!  Again, DELICIOUS and strong cocktails!  
I don't do cilantro, so not only did they make the guacamole without it, the quesadilla usually comes with a mole (with cilantro) on the plate. They even put that on the side for us!!!  The elote was terrific and all of the food was fast and hot!
The best part about our visit though was the service!!!  As we sat at our table, multiple servers came by to check on us... even though we weren't \"their\" table!  Mario came by a few times and always had a huge smile and was so so helpful and friendly!  What a wonderful human to employ!  Our server, Nate, took the cake!  He was attentive and funny and friendly and he just made us feel so welcome!  He didn't miss a beat with our order or weird food needs !   Nate really made this place move from 4 to 5 stars!!  Thank you, Chico Malo, for a wonderful night!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place downtown. From the chicken skewers ... to the Elote! We came for dinner last night and brunch today. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After a mixup regarding hours of operation, it took two tries to be able to eat here. The owner, Kate, reached out to me through Yelp to see if she could earn my business another day.  My original review was somewhat less than gratuitous, however Kate invited myself and my family back and showed us a wonderful time. We ordered a few drinks, tableside guac, tacos, and a dessert. Our food was good, I'd definitely recommend the avocado tacos, they were sweet, light and delicious. The tableside guac was wonderful that is had so many options, we added in all of the ingredients, even the banana! The serving size of guac is on the smaller size for the price tag of $14. Overall, I'll definitely be back. The decor and ambience are just perfect. It is a good addition to downtown and I'm looking forward to seeing it do well. It is nice to see restaurant owners that care about their patrons!"}
{"text":"We came here after the Stand Up Live Comedy show on a Friday Night upstairs. Convenient location and high quality fresh food.

We ordered the scallop and whitefish ceviche, queso fundido, and shrimp tacos.  The scallop and whitefish ceviche tasted very fresh and the best ceviche I had this year in the Greater Phoenix area.  5-stars.  We both loved it.

The queso fundido was actually made out of real cheese.  You can taste the difference.  Plus you can see the melted cheese as you dip the chips in.  Chips were very fresh as well.  Beats fundido at most places that use cheese substitute and it looks clumpy.  Definitely, they have a chef working here. 5-stars.

The shrimp tacos were interesting and tasty.  4.5 stars.

Really nice fun vibe on a Friday night and fun music.  We love this place and plan to visit when we are nearby.

Update 11/18/2017: 

Carne Asada Entree: NY strip steak fajitas is a solid 4-stars.

Service was very good."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!!! The drinks are earthy! But the food is hands down amazing!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food: 3.0
Service: 3.5
Ambiance: 4.0
Wait: 1.5 hrs

I dropped by Chico Malo on a Saturday night around 7:00 pm without a reservation (oh what a mistake on my part). I was told that it'd be a 30 min - 1 hr wait for a table for 2 and figured that I'd try and stick it out. Frankly, I expected to be called in about 40 minutes, but lo and behold that was not the case. My friend and I were seated roughly 1.5 hrs after we had initially put our names down. That being said, it was most likely our faults that we had such a long wait since we showed up at a popular place during peak hours on a Saturday. 

Once we were seated our server brought over some water, took our drink orders, and then effectively disappeared for a while. He did eventually resurface to grab our food orders but after that 1.5 hr wait, we were both feeling somewhat impatient. Now it took quite some time for the food to come out though other parties around us who ordered food after us seemed to have at least something on the table. Now I understand that certain foods take a while to be prepped and made and all that, but I expected the chips and guacamole/salsa/mixed bean ceviche to be out quite quickly. The chips, however, took about 20 minutes to be brought out and our food came out immediately after. 

We ordered the trio, the avocado tacos, the al pastor tacos, and the elote. The star of the night for me was the roja salsa in the trio whereas my friend said that the elote was his favorite. Now it's great that we found things we liked, but it was disappointing that they were basically appetizers rather than entrees. In terms of the entrees, my friend enjoyed the al pastor tacos, but felt that they were under seasoned. My avocado tacos were good, but a bit inconsistent. Two of the tacos on my plate were quite salty whereas the other one was super bland. Also, the crema used on the avocado tacos had a coconut undertone that I just did not appreciate very much. I ended up adding roja salsa to them in order to make them more palatable tbh.

I have a feeling that I will not return to this restaurant after my experience tonight, particularly if I don't have a reservation. The inside was beautiful but the noise level was super high, the service was very scattered, and the food just wasn't that great. I just feel that PHX has so many other places that do Mexican cuisine much better."}
{"text":"Just had the mango and chilli marg... Fi#$ that thing is good!! Peter, the guy who invented it was awesome. Need more people like this in our world."}
{"text":"Had to stop into this new spot to see what all the hype is about. When we walked in we were immediately greeted by friendly staff who promptly sat us at our table. We made a res since it was a Friday night. Open concept from the patio/bar area is very inviting and a great way to experience downtown Phoenix. We were told that the restaurant features art from all different local artists! The mural bookcase in the back is spectacular. Now for the food...I wish I could have sampled one of everything and had such a hard time deciding what to get since it all sounded so delicious! We ordered chips and salsa and I couldn't get enough of the green salsa. Great flavors and unlike the typical run of the mill salsas! I got the fried avocado, chorizo/potato, and chicken tacos. All were amazing. These are street taco style packed with quality ingredients. Serious flavors in all of these. We were way too full to get dessert which is shame because it sounded delicious! Overall, extremely impressed with the restaurant from the service to the food. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Pete made sure everything was taken care of. Great place for our big group."}
{"text":"The 3 tacos for $10 is an making deal!! 
All of the tacos are GF. Of all the taco flavors our group's favorite was the green chili pork!
The tortillas are A M A Z I N G - soft, thick, dimensional. 
Queso appetizer is incredible. 
Guac is okay - doesn't even seem they salted or put lime juice in it. 
Service was okay/slow."}
{"text":"Best service we experienced on a 4-day visit to downtown Phoenix. Wait staff was unfailingly helpful to our group of 10 and quick with menu details and recommendations. The timing from the kitchen was impeccable, and the restaurant had a fun vibe. Our party particularly loved the trio appetizer (chips and salsa, guacamole and mixed bean ceviche) and you cannot go wrong with the green Chile chicken entree."}
{"text":"What a wide variety of flavors for the pallette  to enjoy."}
{"text":"Not even embarrassed to admit that we went here for lunch and immediately decided to return for dinner. For lunch (technically Brunch on Sunday)  we started with the shrimp ceviche. This was not served with chips, which surprised us at first- but we quickly realized we didn't need them. The watermelon in this dish was a surprising and refreshing addition. I could have eaten 3 of these to my self. My husband and I ordered the Pozole (a Mexican soup/stew) and the Al Pastor tacos. Both were excellent, but the Pozole stole the show. The broth was INCREDIBLE. It's very filling with succulent morsels of pork and of course gooey cheese. It's served with fresh homemade tortillas that are so freaking good. I loved the pork in the tacos, great texture. We also had margaritas- which were very strong! Lol 

We returned later for happy hour / dinner and sat at the bar. The happy hour menu is small, but sufficient. They only offer two wine options total (on regular menu too) and the white was a blend that was heavy on the chard (per the bartender). So I went with another marg and learned they are in fact draft margs. I was annoyed at first, but I'm sure they are homemade still- just premade! This round wasn't as strong as lunch, but still delicious. We ordered the HH appetizer shrimp ceviche tostada for another taste of that! We also ordered the vegetable tamale and the leg of lamb of dinner. We were quite full by the time the lamb came, but somehow we managed to eat most it- it was huge! And we didn't even break the bank for dinner, all very reasonably priced. 4 drinks, two apps and one entree all for about $75. Would definitely return next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and food. A little overpriced but expected in downtown. Good Happy Hour"}
{"text":"What a glorious space! Feels fresh and inviting.  Food was creative and a pure delight to my tastebuds.  If you're looking for a \"basic\"Mexican food experience - this is not your restaurant.  You won't find enchiladas or Tex-mex fajitas.  Instead it's traditional plates that have been jazzed up.  Definitely try the margs.  They aren't drowned in sweet and sour.  If you have some time - get the story about the art from one of the visually appealing management staff.  If you're on a date - this place seals the deal every time."}
{"text":"Ate here last night for dinner.  Each dish was fantastic!  Tried the fish tacos, it was an explosion of flavor that I was not expecting, but loved it!  Highly recommend the margarita as well.  I also recommend the shrimp ceviche.  Is is difficult to find a place that creates a great blend of flavors, you can feel the love in the food and service."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say. Have been treated very well by the staff and bartenders. Catered to our 10 person party and did an excellent job."}
{"text":"Our table of five were seated quickly and we ordered several menu items to share.  Shrimp tacos, bean sides, and the tamales were a hit.  Guacamole was average, and chimichangas were big, and above average.  All in All an excellent experience, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice variety of nouveau Tex-Mex, they warn you if a cocktail is 'spirit-forward', good chance to learn lots of foodie vocab, some terms I had not come across in my travels.

Had a good mole dish. And a negro something that charcoal with mescal (?) very different and adventurous"}
{"text":"Happy hour is a must here!! **thumbs up** House margarita was yumm. Really pleased with the quality of drinks and especially the quality of food. Staff was great and very knowledgeable of the area. Chile Relleno here is beyond words, super good. Had the shrimp ceviche, good, not great. Oh, and another great thing about this place is that they did a really great job attending to our large party [20+ people]. They always came by to see if we were ready for another round before our drinks got too low."}
{"text":"I came here before a show and was a great start to my night. Not only was the waiter very friendly and nice he also has some great recommendations. Great vibe and terrific cocktails. I got the scallops and they were delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"GREAT food! Had the Al Pastor Tacos and it was some of the best Al Pastor I've ever had. My wife had a chimichanga which was equally great. The kitchen messed up and we didn't get our appetizer until it was brought out with our meal, however a manager immediately came over and apologized and comped the appetizer. Service was great on the whole."}
{"text":"Wow this place was amazing.  Hector was awesome.  Everything we ate was so amazing and prepared with so many different flavors. The drink choice were so creative.  This place is hands down a must."}
{"text":"Checked this place out tonight and was thoroughly impressed. 
Come here with the perspective of wanting Mexican food out of the ordinary and not something to satiate you in the middle or after a night of drinking. 

In terms of the environment, the decor was awesome. The murals throughout the restaurant were unique and artistic especially the bookcase in the back of the restaurant. They help to bring a sense of liveliness with a Mexican influence that is lacking in downtown Phoenix. 

Service was attentive with great recommendations from our server, Ben, throughout the course of the meal. Ben provided thorough descriptions of the menu items that were unfamiliar to myself and the others in my party. 

Regarding the food, my party and I had the chips and salsa, a selection of tacos, the scallop entree, and the Mexican panna cotta. The salsas all had great and distinctive flavors and were complemented from the crunch and well-seasoned tortilla chips. The roja was my favorite as it had the right bit of brightness and spice. The tacos (al pastor, baja fish, and duck carnitas) were the highlight of the night. While the tacos themselves were small, they were filling and packed with flavor, especially the duck carnitas. Each taco had the right balance of richness and acidity. The tortillas were soft and hand-made in the restaurant that helps to set them apart from other Mexican restaurants in the area. The scallops were phenomenal; they were a great size and perfectly cooked. The grits served as an accompaniment is something I would order on its own as they were delicious, luscious, and creamy. The panna cotta was the perfect ending to the dinner, light, fruity, with a little bit of spice. Overall, I came here for an experience outside of regular Mexican/Tex-Mex and was wholly satisfied. 

Some of the cocktails may need a deeper explanation and/or some work on, but this place has a lot of potential especially since it has just opened so recently. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Took 20 minutes to get our first drink at the bar while we waited, got seated, took another 30 minutes to get our drinks at our table. Ordered and they screwed up the order completely and then they tried to make it right by removing the guacamole that never came  and then billed us for it. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! My other half and I live downtown and we experience the different dining options in the valley frequently. We are always excited for new restaurants. Chico Malo blew us away! Really urban and unique interior experience. Great music...and the service was the best we have experienced. We were really
Impressed with the different flavor combinations. Super tasty tacos and definitely try the rice. Our night got a thousand times better when we ordered the pineapple dessert. Most unique and best dish I've tried. Margaritas were perfect...we honestly enjoyed every bit. Super excited to have such a unique restaurant we can venture to on the regular."}
{"text":"Definitely not my type of tacos :  I went out with some friends we decided to give it a try .  I love going to different restaurants and taste different things. I love food and places with a unique atmosphere.  This place has an ok atmosphere however i was totally disappointed with their food portions.  The tiny overpriced tacos are not to die for totally not worth it. 
       Who wants to spent 30$ for 5 mini 4inch tiny taquitos.  Umm this place  will not be one of my fav sorry.."}
{"text":"Great spot downtown. They have a wide range of tacos, 3 for $10, however they are only available during lunch. They don't have the same range of tacos on the dinner menu. We are lucky the hostess could care less about her job and gave us both menus. The sever was able to get the chef to let us have the taco special. The green chili taco was amazing."}
{"text":"Im only giving this review 2 stars due to the fact that they claim to have a \"happy hour menu\" when the price of an item on the happy hour menu matches the price on the regular menu. I don't appreciate being deceived by the name of the menu. I brought it up to our waiter and he agreed that it was the same but were hoping no one would notice."}
{"text":"I saw an article about Chico Malo online when it opened and had patiently been waiting to go on my next visit to the desert. Being from California, some might say we're snobby with our Mexican food. However, I prefer the term connoisseur, but I digress...That's all to say I was highly anticipating my visit and it did not disappoint!

I went with a group of seven, which was great because we got to try a lot of the menu -- both food and drinks. Everything was fantastic, but some absolute standouts were the queso fundido, short ribs, churro bread pudding, and the alebrije. 

The space is amazing. The designer truly took her time to plan out an inviting and unique space. I especially loved the rotating roosters and back wall of books! 

If I lived closer I would be a regular, but until then I'll keep looking forward to meals at Chico Malo when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Good food, good service.  Good happy hour.  Ambiance is clean and contemporary.  I ordered everything they had on the happy hour menu and the prices for the portions were great.  Great place to enjoy happy hour with friends!

Don't orfer the sangria.  It is $11 and only served in an 8oz glass.  Beautiful but I felt robbed.  It tasted bad, too.  My mistake, though.  Next time I'll drink beer."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here for a margarita and while there were no seats at the bar, they offered full service in a lounge area so we ordered two margaritas.  We didn't get food because we were eating elsewhere but the margaritas were very good.  

What was kind of funny is that on the menu, they simply have one margarita that they call \"Margarita.\"  

There was a good vibe in there as well."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic about this place and I had high hopes for them until I showed up to eat.  They don't work with you if you have a food allergy. I asked for a simple substitute and the server made it seem impossible.  The service was bad for the price you pay.  I've been to better places downtown with great food that are willing to be accommodating.  Bottom line, service was slow (even on the slow night I went on) server was rude, and the food was eh."}
{"text":"Awesome spot especially for downtown! The food is fantastic and I never leave unsatisfied. The trio is perfect to get started and we usually order a few different things to share. Good vibes and great staff! Now that the weather is ideal, sitting outside on the patio is my favorite place to go!"}
{"text":"Wow where do I start?
What a GREAT addition to CityScape in downtown Phoenix. As you walk up to the building, you have the feeling you are in for a great experience. Well Chico Malo doesn't disappoint you! Once you enter you're surrounded by a great modern, loft like interior. The open kitchen greats you as you walk past the bar area. The entire space is warmed up by comfortable tables, great lighting and decor.
Okay you're saying...what about the food?
Fasten your seat belt folks...! Chef Chops Smith doesn't disappoint. His creativity and culinary detail will knock your socks off. Chico Malo has an amazing and diverse menu of offerings. My dining companion and I hard a hard time deciding on which dish was going to win the coveted 'last bite' award. We both decided that the Papas Con Chorizo was the winner. WOW...!
I had the Baja Fish Taco served ever so lightly breaded and fried with and served with the perfect bite of spice and sweet, all on a Squid Ink tortilla. I also ate the Crispy Avocado Taco. What an incredibly fresh bite that was. My co-diner also had the Crispy Avocado Taco, as well as the Pork Belly Taco...YES a Pork Belly Taco with charred broccolini and pistachio!
Let's not forget the cocktails...! the House Margarita is not to be missed. Ever so tasty with a hint of vanilla.
Enough about how good the food was...the service was just as welcoming and attentive. I love attention without any hovering or interruptions. We spent 3 hours there for 'lunch' and felt so appreciated and not a burden to our server Hector was great! Special thanks to the mgr Zach O'Haire for the special cocktails. The descriptions of their background blew my guest away, in a way that made you want to jump right into your drink.
So Yes, we enjoyed this new addition to CityScape and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Chico Malo while in Phoenix last week. I wanted a little nourishment to keep me going until a late dinner we had planned. While I order wine, my lady selected the margarita - she loved it.

Next we opted for Pork Tacos and Chips with Shrimp Ceviche. The Pork Tacos were scrumptious. I would order again. Our chips were fresh and the Ceviche included tasty shrimp, watermelon, onion, radish, avocado and lime.  

Service was very good."}
{"text":"I went in here before catching a comedy show because it had 4 stars and we were so hungry that I thought anything would taste good. I was completely wrong. Food was terrible- I had the Pirk Verde- I could not finish my meal it wa horrible tasting. My husband had Al Pastor Tacos which were close to mediocre, but not great. I love the vibe and ambiance of the place that's why I gave it 2 stars."}
{"text":"I normally do not give bad reviews. I love food! However, I cannot eat the spicy corn. It was way too hot! The waitress was kind enough to take it back and said she would have them take off the spicy aioli sauce but when she brought it out it tasted exactly the same! I also ordered the Mayan salad with al pastor meat and it did not taste good. The mix of the flavors were not compatible. Wish I would have stuck to just ordering regular tacos. The. I ordered the Nuevo guacamole and even though I like pomegranate and sunflower seeds the mix of flavors did not go! How can I not have liked any of the items?!?!? That is the first in my life. I love Mexican food! Love a mix of flavors but this was not cutting it. 

However if you want a good drink and a fun atmosphere this is your spot!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to hit prior to any event downtown. The accessibility was easy. The evening we attended, we made a reservation and was given assigned seating for the comedy club. Not sure if that is a norm, but might be nice to ask. The server was fun and helpful. Food was a bit slow coming out, but it was a busy Fri evening. The food was worth the bit of waiting. So very delicious and lots of flavors that all worked together beautifully. Only draw back, really noisy. Was hard to visit with my friends but all the good outweighed that little bad. Def recommend..."}
{"text":"This place has a sports bar atmosphere and service style, with above-sports-bar prices. However, if you're willing to accept those terms, it's a good place with creative food. The lamb shank that I ordered was beautifully cooked and served on some amazingly delicious pilaf-y stuff that was full of slightly crunchy nopalitos. The sangria was also tasty. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Is this is suppose to be Mexican food?! You use Frida Kahlo as an anchor to deliver authenticity and a connection to Mexican food.  We had your street corn was it from a can?  Green giant corn?   Take down the beautiful art if you are not willing to educate your staff on our beautiful traditions."}
{"text":"I went with a group of folks from a conference in downtown Phoenix and was told \"We're going to a Mexican restaurant.\"  That wasn't exactly a lie, but calling Chico Malo \"a Mexican restaurant\" is like calling an iPhone a calculator.  First, it took a while to take in the whole menu - so many varieties of food, each with every single ingredient listed.  I ordered the diablo shrimp tacos, which were tasty, plump shrimp in light soft tortilla tacos, a little bit of spice and crunchy shreds of cabbage and some smooth avocado.  There was also some huge plate of chips mixed with all kinds of goodies that kept getting passed around - I didn't order it, but I ate more than my share.  This appears to be a fancy place from the looks of it, and the food is really good, but don't be fooled if someone calls it just \"a Mexican restaurant.\"  It's much more than that."}
{"text":"Been here a few times typically before I hit up the Van Buren since its such a close walk.  Really love the martini the bartender with the mustache makes me whenever I pop in.  What is his name??"}
{"text":"Went for opening last night and had a blast at the bar with my girlfriend. All the cocktails we tried were amazing and unique! I highly recommend the table side guacamole (so many cool mix in options - try it with banana!). The elote and the chicharones were delicious too. I can't wait to come back and try more of the tacos. Such a beautiful space and a welcome addition to downtown!"}
{"text":"Limited menu, the Guacamole was excellent. Even though we were there at Happy House: Cadillac Margaritas were $16, way over the top for small servings My Chimichanga was different but OK Service was good."}
{"text":"Good food, amazing atmosphere,  mediocre service, bad price. Got chips and salsa, a lunch entree, and a club soda and it was $25 with tax and tip. Too much for lunch. They charged me $4 for a club soda which is silly. Food was great. Kudos to the kitchen staff! Bartenders were super slow to take order, bring check, etc...  A lady next to me walked out because she was tired of waiting. I had to get up and hunt down the bartender so I could get the check because I needed to get back to work. I would cone here for dinner, but as someone who works in the neighborhood I would not view this as a viable lunch spot."}
{"text":"With the weather cooling down, my s/o and I decided to go on a walk downtown. Any physical exertion is sufficient for me to justify eating, so I insisted we get food, and we decided on Chico Malo because I liked the hip decor and patio seating and he liked that football was playing on the TVs above the bar. We ordered the salsas roja and verde with chips and an elote to share.

The salsa roja tasted more like marinara than it should've, and the chips were incredibly salty (I wiped every chip off on my napkin before eating, which made them perfect) but everything else totally hit the spot. Pro Tip: Cut the kernels off the cob and scoop up with the chips."}
{"text":"I was hoping Chico Malo was the long awaited answer to authentic Mexican food in Downtown Phoenix, but sadly the wait continues. The food isn't terrible, just mediocre and hilariously over priced. I paid $10 for two small street taco al pastor tacos. They don't come with anything, no rice, no drink, no elote, nothing. The tacos were fine, though the tortillas were a bit dry and the Al Pastor was a bit fatty.

You'd think being in cityscape they'd be catering to lunch time office workers, but they don't seem to be. Getting food for pickup was slow, even though the place was 1/2 empty at 12:30. I asked if they had fountain soda to go, they did not. They have coke in bottles, which is fine, but I assume I'm like most non alcoholics and I don't keep a bottle opener at my desk.

This place is a huge missed opportunity. All told, it's a definite downgrade from the Chloes salad bar that was once housed in this space."}
{"text":"Nice and clean place, Loved the decoration. Great beer selection, But food was disappointing.  On my personal opinion they try to make the food too fancy they forget to give the real authentic Mexican taste."}
{"text":"We have lived in Latino countries and this food is utterly delicious!  Their salsas are unique and flavorful beyond belief.  Atmosphere is very nice and staff kind.  Parking under and they validate for you. It's  a most enjoyable place to dine."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is not authentic Mexican but it is pretty good! The service here is definitely 5+! The waiter that helped us really took his time to explain the menu and what he recommended which is always awesome! The atmosphere here is really modern which is great. They have an indoor and outdoor bar which is great. If you come here you must order the table side guacamole! They make it fresh with all the ingredients that you want. It was super good and wish I could have it every day! The tacos here are super good especially with the pineapple which made it that much more mouthwatering! The restaurant is located downtown area of AZ and next door to CVS. Parking may be a bit tricky since it is downtown and next to businesses but not impossible to find parking. Overall a great experience and will definitely come back again when in the area!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Amazing food. The entire experience was awesome! I suggest the fried avocado tacos."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I can say I probably will not be back. The food was mediocre. We ordered the queso fundido and shared the chimichanga. But the food was besides the point. Our server Melissa was rude. Her attitude was poor and it just seemed like she was upset to be doing her job. We asked her what was on tap and her reply was \"look at the second page, they're all on there.\" Sorry it's our first time here and we had a question. She then brought out their house hot sauces and my boyfriend asked which one was better, her reply... \"figure it out.\" In all, our experience was shitty for lack of better words. Oh not to mention a beer was spilled on me by another server and there wasn't even an apology. Avoid this place, or maybe just ask for a server who likes their job?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great Mexican food with a little South American flare; interesting cocktail menu with some delicious drinks; the design and ambiance was amazing! 
The roasted corn and nachos for an appetizer were not at all what I expected, but in a good way! I have no idea how to explain them, you'll just have to go see for yourself. I also had the carne asada and duck tacos and they were amazing too. I didn't believe them that the margaritas on tap were fresh, but after one sip I stood corrected. I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the food and cocktails!"}
{"text":"Kicking off with - ABISMO NEGRO mezcal + crème de cacao mas mole bitters + charcoal. Buzz? NAILS IT!!"}
{"text":"I love guacamole!  They make it in front of you while you pick the ingredients!  The sangrias are delicious.  I haven't tried the rest of the food just stopped in real quick to get a couple drinks with friends, but I want to go back soon and get their gauc and try the tacos!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I've never been disappointed. The food is always solid, service is top notch. And I LOVE the decor. Such a unique vibe for downtown. That being said, the prices are definitely a touch high for Mexican food. Overall, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Can't speak for the food, but my boyfriend & I stopped for drinks in the early afternoon. Jamie at the bar was great & extremely knowledgeable. The red sangria was bomb. Instead of a super fruity taste, it had a dark cinnamon taste, which I loved. The atmosphere is great & in a nice location."}
{"text":"Was downtown for business and looking for authentic Mexican - the hotel said this was it for something within walking distance.

Awesome ambiance. Great service. Food was hit or miss... Elote was awesome - huge cob of corn with the perfect balance of flavors and a tiny bit of kick. Duck tamale was okay - it was huge, but had very little duck and the flavors were a bit muted. Pozole was delicious - flavorful, well-stocked with the ingredients described, and perfect balance of meat and fat. White sangria was okay - I'd get something else next time.

All that said, I'd return and try other dishes, and would order the elote again for sure!"}
{"text":"Great location. 
Great atmosphere. 
Great presentation. 
The staff is truly friendly and welcoming. The food is a type of fusion of Mexican gourmet that brings out fantastically creative dishes. This is a new found treasure downtown that I hope everyone enjoys. They have great cocktails too. Visit. Enjoy. Make them them continue to wow. 
All things aside, they brought us the best guacamole we've ever had."}
{"text":"Great little place to have drinks and appetizers. Not to busy when we stopped by. Margaritas are pretty amazing and shrimp tacos were delicious. I recommend it for a place to socialize, drinks and appetizers. Customer service was awesome and the staff is very pleasant. Great way to start the evening and a few drinks. The menu is simple and straight to the point, not an overwhelming menu. Love it and will be back again."}
{"text":"Loved this place. First, a caveat: don't go here for authentic Mexican food. Think of it as Mexican- and Southwest-inspired, with its own flair. I was in Phoenix for a week and ended up here four times, twice for lunch, once for drinks and apps, and another time for drinks and desserts. It's an easy meeting spot for folks in town for a conference and staying in nearby hotels (that was our situation). The food is fun and to the decadent side, not a place to go when trying to slim down or cleanse. The chips, guacamole and salsa are great, and in the hot Phoenix weather, my friends and I enjoyed the white sangria, punctuated with pineapple and mint. Service is friendly and attentive, and the environment is upbeat and tasteful."}
{"text":"Que Chingado?!? The salsa was terrible. Just about zero Vegan options except for the $14 small side of guacamole. You get a small bottle of diet coke for $5... my friends are flesh eaters so they ordered food that was equally overpriced. The service was slow along with the kitchen... everything took forever along with the guacamole to the getting of our checks. By the end of the night we made it across the courtyard and got some burritos at another establishment. It's too bad that we lost the Corner to this hot overpriced mess. Chico Malo lives up to the name, it's all No Bueno y Vale Madre!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service, excellent atmosphere, and delicious food! Love the vibe and our server Angel was the best!! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Skip the house margarita!! 


A friend and I stopped in here after a baseball game. I work downtown so was sad to see Chloe's go but excited to see what new thing was coming in. The tacos were delicious, most of them are gourmet rather than traditional. I had the tacos al pastor, pork belly and Baja fish. The fish wasn't my favorite and I wouldn't order again. The pastor was very traditional and delicious, the pork belly was my favorite! We also ordered the guacamole which the make fresh table side, I loved being able to pick what to put in. Would definitely order again. The prices are a bit high, there are other taco places near by that have lower prices and just as good of food. A few tacos are filling but the prices of entrees there are a bit steep for the area.

The only reason I couldn't give this 4 stars is because the margarita was absolutely horrible, whoever decided to put vanilla into a margarita was way off. My friend and I could stomach more than a few sips."}
{"text":"I've been hankering to try this place, but unfortunately every time I have been downtown for an event, it's packed! 

I finally was able to meet friends here for brunch and now I fully understand why there's always a crowd.

The brunch menu, has a little bit of everything, from Mexican inspired breakfast to just egg dishes. I ordered the frittata luchador (pictured below). It was a hearty portion, though I wish more of the verde sauce was added. The flavors were excellent. 

My only complaint is chips and salsa aren't provided, they are extra. However, along with the guac, they were worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and service. This is not a traditional Mexican restaurant, but the food is high quality and the presentation is impressive. I  can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Everything was fresh and came out timely. Melissa and the rest of the staff helped us out, wonderful service. Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Pre-concert drinks are a necessity so we accidentally wandered in here tonight, thinking it was another restaurant. Oops, but what a great mistake. We ordered the watermelon cocktail (god I don't remember the damn name), but it was interesting with its smokey tequila, fresh melon, and a hint of chili. We were just going to get dessert ( the pineapple panna cotta was divine), but the huge cart-o-guacamole rolled by, so of course we couldn't turn that down. There were so many interesting options to add to the mighty guac. I wanted to try the chicken skin, and my husband had to be really weird and add banana, much to my protest--but what the hell, you only live once! We added it all in addition to a lot of heat! It was so delicious and interesting, I wanted to throw the rest in my purse with a spoon for the concert, but you know, class... All in all, we really enjoyed this place and look forward to making it our downtown spot. On a side note, the chef was banging and f-bombing passionately in the kitchen. Next Gordon Ramsey? Maybe, but definitely a seat indoors next to the kitchen next time for dinner and a show. Whatever he's doing in there, it's working! Food was great. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere! Went in for a lunch bite today, was pretty empty, but the food and service was still really good.

Got the build it yourself quesadilla and it was like a pan of melted cheese with chorizo or mushrooms in it, then a side of corn tortillas and you literally put it all together yourself... very interesting, never had it before, but was tasty (not filling).

Look forward to trying their 3 for $10 tacos next time."}
{"text":"Awful. Save your money and go somewhere else. Guacamole isn't bad, the remainder isn't good. The husband never complains, but he did at this restaurant. Not kid friendly and limited substitutions."}
{"text":"Two coworkers and I had a great experience here.  The hostess was promt and courteous.  The staff was very helpful with the menu (it's not your run of the mill Mexican food items) and the drinks were great.  

The food was an adventure.  As I stated before, it's not run of the mill Mexican food, and the chef and cook staff did an amazing job blending flavors and ingredients that I've never seen and/or heard of.  You get what you pay for and it's worth it.

The decor is gorgeous, with just the right mixture of high end and edgy to it. 

I've already chosen the restaurant to be a good location for business lunch and social hour, with the agreement of my coworkers that this is a great place to bring other co-workers and consultants."}
{"text":"In town for a few days and tried some very good tacos. This place was recommended to me by a woman at my hotel and I will go back again"}
{"text":"If you are a foodie, as I am, get to Chico Malo as soon as you can. This is not typical Mexican-American food. This is Mexican-South American food and it is FANTASTIC! We have dined here previously, and always have a great experience. 

Fresh grapefruit juice palomas. So delicious! Fresh made tortillas. Ceviche tostada and potato taco appetizers. 

Dinner was coconut rice and a duck tamale. 
Best. Tamale. Ever. The masa is a light, fluffy cloud with so much incredible flavor. It melts in your mouth. 

This chef layers flavors and textures into every dish. The end result is outstanding food. We will be back again and again. Highly recommend Chico Malo."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I followed and waited for this restaurant to open for months. Maybe I just had high expectations. The atmosphere/ vibe I loved. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. It had that chic urban vibe that I love about Downtown Phoenix. The nichie nachos as my appetizer was really good. I ordered the pork verde as my entree and it was bland. I don't think in my entire life I have ever said that about food inspired by Mexican cuisine. It wasn't horrible nor great either. The chips and salsa they served were ok. They heavily salted the chips where it wasn't enjoyable to eat more than 5 chips. I asked the waiter if they could not salt the chips but he said he couldn't accomadate that. I think the most disappointing thing was their salsa. I am Mexican American and I grew up with Mexican food my entire life. I feel like salsa is like the most important part about Mexican food. I tried the Roja and Montezuma salsa and they were ok. Nothing really special about them. I had a couple of cocktails and they were good, but not great. The decor of the restaurant didn't fit my aesthetic. The lawn chair looking tables with the \"Mexican blanket\" design looked campy/cheesy as well as the roosters everywhere. Apart me can't help but feel a tiny bit offended/eyes rolling in the back of my head. I was hoping this place would be an elevated, urban, chic restaurant that combined traditional and new cuisine concepts to the forefront of how we view Mexican food. It does sort of give off that impression, but it missed the mark. I will go back because I want to try other items and maybe my mind will be swayed to up my stars on my review."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Nice clean place, friendly staff...but food was a disappointment and prices were outrageous. Ex: a CAN of Diet Coke was $3.00!  After chips and salsa, a can of Diet Coke, and a plate of carne (about 6-8 ounces) my bill after tip was over $30!  

The food was a bit bland. Expected the carne asada to be amazing at $19 and I left half on the plate. Very gross. 

Go to Chipotle across the walkway and save $20."}
{"text":"I love this place! We went to go just get chips and salsa but ended up staying and having their tacos! Wonderful day out with friends and family! The atmosphere is great and the location is right by all other shopping. If you like good food.... you will love Chico!!!"}
{"text":"If you love your small hipster tacos, then this is the place for you!  The food here is outstanding, the service is beyond awesome and the owners are some of the best out there.  I've been here twice and so happy that they are at CityScape now!"}
{"text":"Being vegetarians it's usually hard to find options on a menu but this place offered quite a few. We had the avocado tacos and chile relleno and were very impressed. We also tried couple of their cocktails and they were so good - unique in taste and the server took his time to answer our questions. Would def go back to this place!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for some time, but with so many amazing options nearby I had not gotten a chance. Sadly, I did not try the food, my date for the night was not \"hungry\"....But I was not leaving without trying something. So, I had drinks....I tried the Oaxacan.... I honestly don't remember what is in it but it was about a triple shot tequila and some other liquors that made the tequila bitterness taste sweet. I did glance at the menu and was dissapointed to not see other but 1 taco option. 
The ambience was chill, it's a big space the tables are well spaced, the decor is nice.
The only down fall was that I was there was absolutely 0 tp in the bathroom. And it was full lots of ladies in there, thankfully they had paper towels to dry your hands which everyone was taking....however. this posed a problem because there were no trash cans in there and flushing down the toilet would have clogged it. It happened... not to me but the stall next to mine. Slight overlook on the maintenance crew, probably cost the restaurant some money....regardless of that the bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Cool spot to hang out. Drink and eat. Service was okay. My server was cool and all but not inviting in any way. very \"bar\" quality. The food was awesome. I had the corn. The chip and Guac. My wife had the short ribs. The rib was super tender and the sauce was excellent.

It's right in the middle of a fun area of Downtown Phoenix. It has a cool view and the bar is open and welcoming.

I like it!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! Best part was the house made hot sauces!  The taste was incredible and legitimately had heat!"}
{"text":"Went here for my friends birthday last week. High quality=high price. The tacos are delicious, the servers are attentive and personable, and the drinks are strong, fun, and affordable. Definitely worth a try, would absolutely go again. Nice place for a cocktail, a couple tacos, or just to eat their salsa which was freakin delicious and creative. Go to Chico Malo!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a shot, twice! 

The first time I went with my two year old and my husband. The food was not up to par with the atmosphere. It was cold and our waiter took forever to serve us. Plus he was rude to our two year old daughter. They don't have a kids menu so I had to order my daughter a $6 taco so she could have something to eat of her own. 
My husband also observed our waiter \"lightly\" wash his hands (no soap) and proceeded to open the door with his bare hands. Yuck! 

My second visit was with friends. I hoped our experience would be better. We arrived 45 minutes before close and didn't receive a menu for 7 minuets after being seated. We ordered beers and then watched as the staff stood around and chatted. After 10 minutes my girlfriend asked our waiter if our drinks where poured yet. He rudely replied \"no.\" We then excused ourselves and he abruptly replied \"cool\" as if he didn't want us there anyway. I'm so disappointed with the poor customer service. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Loved it and will come back again. Had the fish, chicken, and avocado tacos. All three were perfect."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Seattle and stopped by with some friends. First impressions were great - the decor is really cool! The drinks are very well crafted with unique ingredients outside of your traditional sweet cocktails you might find elsewhere. They just opened so the service still seems to be finding itself, but they were all extremely friendly. The ribeye was one of the best ribeye I've ever had with a nice smokey flavor. The corn was also amazing. I've seen others on here complain about the pricing, but I'd suggest they go to Taco Bell if they are looking for super cheap tacos instead of the more artisan experience you're going to get here."}
{"text":"Really 3.5

I think came here in an off night.
First I wanted the beautiful tacos I see in the photos  on Yelp.  The menu I had only had one taco on it.  When I asked the waiter.  He told me that was the only menu they had.  I then ordered the fried burrito and it looked amazing!!! 


However the burrito tasted pretty bad.

I don't think I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"The BEST Mexican food I've had! The dorados de papa is to die for. Incredibly friendly and personable service. Our server was so awesome. One of the owners even came up and talked to us for a bit and was just as awesome. If you're looking for actual authentic Mexican and Latin food, this is it."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio this place was great! Food is delish and creative without being intimidating. The Mango spice Martini is  awesome I had 4!. Service was good but we were there before a big concert so the bar was packed and drinks came a little slower than expected. Price was reasonable in my opinion. This is part of the CityScape complex so there's definitely much to do in the area. I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Neil Diamond concert was Fabulous! Left Talking stick Arena and they handed out redeem tickets for 2$ off till midnight. So we checked it out. Not only was the customer service great my carne asada taco was amazing! Maya our server is awesome and after a amazing concert this establishment is perfect for a cocktail and a little bite eats!! We will come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite spot! Has a little bit of everything on the menu and it all looks sooo good and just a little different than the typical. Very unique flavor.  We couldn't decide so we ordered everything on the happy hour menu and enjoyed it all. The Papas con chorizo were the perfect bite size and the chorizo wasn't too oily. 
The only feedback is for the corn/elote, I would have liked to have the option to eat it on the cob or have them shave it maybe table side. 
Mario was our server and he was awesome, friendly, fun and on top of everything."}
{"text":"Wandered in and fell in love. The duck street taco was insanely delicious and slightly larger than the normal size yet priced in-line with competitors, providing way more value and allowing 2-3 tacos as the perfect choice.  Great service, super friendly staff, and A+ location... 5 stars"}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday!!! The food is authentic, fresh and just plain DELICIOUS. The staff is friendly and the vibe of the restaurant is inviting. My favorite thing on the menu is their elote!! Seriously, one of the best dishes I have ever had. Thanks Chico Malo, you will see me around :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and will definately return. the atmosphere is fun with Frida paintings and rotating cocks (yea I said it). 

I tried the posole, fried avacado taco, fish taco, quesadilla (add carne) and all were delicioso. If you are a fan of street tacos you will dig this place. I am reminded a bit of El Hefe in Tempe, I bet the nightlife here is fun as well. 

If you are down town check it out."}
{"text":"From the service to the food, this is one of the best spots in Phoenix! The service was fast and friendly, and the food is incredible! The cherry pecan mole on the duck carnitas is ridiculous. This spot is a great way to get your night started!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a pre-game eat and after a quick Yelp-check, we stumbled upon Chico Malo. This place has a nice ambiance to it and the service was solid. 

I ordered chips and salsa, as well as one of their happy hour special dishes (I can't recall the name of it). The chips and salsa were decent, though I've had better. However, for just $5, my special dish was incredible. There were a ton of different flavors on the plate, surrounding a crispy tortilla shell stuffed with purple potato."}
{"text":"Tried this place after cityskate this evening and was blown away by the service (or lack there of) and horrendous food. (update: okay emotions were high... the food was not horrendous it was very unexpectedly different.)


Without ranting, the place was very modern and hip, cool atmosphere and great location. Aside from that the rest was beyond subpar.

Out of date beer, over a month past the best by date.
Food was cold in the middle and just not what was expected. That would have been fine if the server had checked on us at least once to console our feelings of discontent, but he did not. 
One of our dining guests ordered a salad that came undressed, and requesting dressing went unheard. She did finally get her dressing after the rest of the table had finished their meals. 
However, the restaurant was not busy at all. We counted one large party and six other tables throughout the establishment. 

The service made the entire experience. 
And it was not a good one at all.


Management promptly contacted me to correct the situation. I appreciate it and will try again."}
{"text":"Chico Malo's is definitely a place I will soon be visiting again! I had a the shrimp ceviche, it was delicious, the elote, that was to die for!! The margarita was also outstanding, they marinate there tequila with rose or something along that line and had a floral taste. With all that being said, I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Chico Malo did not disappoint. My boyfriend surprised me for my birthday with 5 of my close friends Saturday night. Our server Nate was amazing and attentive. He patiently indulged my never ending menu questions and accommodated my equally annoying special diet considerations. 
Everyone LOVED their dinners. Cocktails were equally lovely and overall we are new fans and can't wait to come back and try more on the menu. Portions were great, the salsa flight was sooo good. I ordered the green chili chicken, others got the short ribs, shrimps tacos, chimis and a salad that looked incredible. I would highly recommend coming here for any occasion! 
Thank you Nate for making my special day even more special!"}
{"text":"A few of my girlfriends had lunch on the patio the other day. Our server was super friendly and had excellent recommendations. Three of us got the tacos and one got a salad. We were all very pleased with our choices. The fish taco is great and the avocado taco was yummy as well. The patio is a beautiful place to enjoy the courtyard. Very pleased with our meal!"}
{"text":"Fabulous experience! I came here with my sister and her kids for her birthday. Mario was our server. He was the best ever. Great atmosphere, music, near downtown festivities...bring ur friends and family, enjoy ur celebrations here. Come see MARIO!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good.  Especially before a comedy show.  Food is on point and truly authentic with some real nice touches.  I had the Chile Colorado with Home made corn tortillas and it was on point.  We also had the poodle which was good but need more hominy but did have plenty of meat and was a little greasy.  The guacamole Isaac also good. Drinks are alright and a little above price but overall definitely a good atmosphere and deserves a strong 4 star."}
{"text":"Had the sugar skull drink with a pineapple and rum drink. Too strong! Nonetheless I drank it after adding more pineapple in it. My daughter had the French toast. It was delicious with French baguettes and caramelized bananas and yummy cinnamon syrup sauce. I ordered the Steak Tomahawk platter with grilled veggies and guacamole. We were very excited but it was too rare and half the steak was pure fat and gristle. NOT HAPPY. We were too starved to send it back to cook a bit  more. Not worth the $80.00. The service was very slow. We loved the restaurant itself. It's beautiful and very artistic with the beautiful Mexican inspired murals. My daughter and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Came here before the Kenny Chesney concert. Chill atmosphere and low music allowed our group to converse without having to feel like we were yelling.

Service was great! We were even given free shots to \"try\" and they were very well made. Food was delicious and my group agreed they had some of the best margaritas that area has to offer. Would highly recommend but be warned this is not the place to go if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant. It has an authentic Mexican taste that runs through your mouth. Every bite is a pleasure. If you visit Down Town Phoenix you must come to Chico Malo. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great plate of short ribs last evening Mexican style. Chips and salsa were awesome.  The Mexican chocolate pudding was super good. The service was great! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was exceptional. Grant recommended great vegetarian options for my friend and I and who don't eat meat. Sal also helped us out every step of the way. When you come in, ask for these two;)"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and the look is what truly draws in its crowds. However, I will not be returning do to the service I received at the bar tonight. My drink that I ordered off of their signature cocktails was nothing like the description and was actually disappointing. The bartender was a blonde female who I truly felt cared more about making sure no one walked out on their tabs then actually taking care of her customers. I was very interested in ordering food and very hungry however she never checked up on me to place my order. I had to wait after my drink was empty for quite some time to just close my tab and leave. Not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"Dang another taco disappointment.... stop trying to be fancy. Give me food not cold and don't stuff a lot on a street sized tortilla that's not all the way cooked. Please have enough staff so a hostess isn't my server. The bartender did not know after being open there was no watermelon already cut for one of their specialty drinks.shrimp ceviche should have more than 10 tiny cut pieces of shrimp otherwise you just gave me tomato, cucumber, jicama ceviche... the drinks were good but very pricey for size... definitely not dinner place only happy hour appetizer place better than casa anejo but more expensive. Back to Ritos or Carolinas or Pepe's"}
{"text":"This restaurant was off the chain! We are from la and the food was sooo delicious. Definitely recommend this place to anyone. The service was amazing and gave us a quick background on some of their dishes. The drinks were really refreshing. Also just because the name is in Spanish it doesn't mean they are Mexican. They have chefs that study food from around the world. The food tastes authentic and bursts with flavors. Go check them out you won't be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and was surprised to find, despite them just opening up, they were out of bread for the Torta I was going to order. I ended up getting a salad, which was just okay. They do have an excellent salsa (the peanut-based one) though that stood out. This is another place where you pay a lot of money for tiny tacos (something I still can't get my head around...but my friends had a nice presentation, which is obviously required). Won't be back."}
{"text":"I tried the Carne Asada that was created from a t bone cut vs a flank strip and enjoyed the presentation and flavor. Instead of the traditional rice and beans, guacamole and cabbage along with street style tortillas were delivered. The meal was quick, fast, and the server was very attentive and helpful. If in the downtown area of Phoenix again, I would return to this place due to the quality of food and the attentive staff."}
{"text":"Creative twist on staple dishes. Food and drinks were delightful. Service was amazing as well. I loved the decor and ambiance as well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible!!! Waited 20 minutes for a table when told 10 minutes..Portions very small. Extra $2 for salsa..20 minutes to get our food at lunchtime..No to go orders until mid May..Not going back..One time was enough!!"}
{"text":"No wine selection, no rum selection, hostess with a snotty attitude. Spent about 10 min here before heading to a Kettle Black for a real bar selection."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and the quality and taste of the food is just as good as the first time except cheaper, which makes it so much better! The elote, ceviche and tacos were all delicious. Will definitely come back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"As the restaurant is in City Scape, one would anticipate that it would be accommodating to the surrounding business professionals during lunch; unfortunately, this is not the case. My co-workers and I went to the restaurant as a group of six, and we were quoted a wait time of fifteen minutes. After a review of the menu and a twenty minute wait, two of our party left.  We updated the hostess that we were now a group of four, and we were told that they were actively readying our table. We waited five more minutes, and asked the hostess again when we would be seated.  We were told that we were next on the list.  Two more tables were then seated before we were. We then approached the hostess stand to let them know that we planned to go elsewhere, and we were then seated after just over twenty-five minutes of waiting.

The server was very prompt in greeting us and asking if we had any questions on the menu.  We ordered and got our food after about twenty minutes.  The gal who ordered the Caesar salad received a plate with three small clusters of lettuce.  It was appealing to the eye, but the portion size left her hungry at the end of the meal.  The gal who ordered black beans received refried (not specified in the menu) black beans.  The flavor and texture left a lot to be desired, and the beans were sent back and removed from the bill.  The final two gals ordered the nachos.  They were pleased with the flavor of the nachos; however, the dish did not actually contain a chip or nacho of any kind.

All-in-all, wait time was longer than anticipated, and the hostess stand was quite unorganized. The food tasted good for the most part, but the menu description did not match what was received for any of the ordered dishes. The atmosphere was very enjoyable, and the service was good. 

We concluded at the end of our meal that this restaurant would serve best as a happy hour location with co-workers after a long day/week of work. We recommend ordering only the chips and salsa, as these actually appeared to be chips and salsa. Also, the regular drink menu and happy hour menu had some excellent options; although, the actual timing of happy hour can't be found on any of the menus."}
{"text":"Came in  for lunch on a recommendation. Great ambiance, friendly staff BUT unfortunately, the food was not so good.
I had the chimichanga and it was not so great..."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and beautifully presented. The service was poor. By poor, I mean rude. Given that it is a little pricey for what you get and there are so many other places to eat downtown, I won't be back for lunch."}
{"text":"Food is great!  Service is not!  

The staff appears to be more concerned about maintaining their hipster vibe instead of providing quality attention to their customers.  They were frequently sitting in booths with friends, chatting with each other at the host stand, and talking with the bartender instead of paying attention to their tables.  At one point, we saw our server sitting on the patio and took a drink from one of his friends cocktails - while we waited 10+ minutes for our second round of drinks.  The server gave attitude when someone in our party asked him to describe a dish prior to ordering.  Sad to know that the service ruined a good food experience.  I will think twice before I consider returning."}
{"text":"Sat down at the bar to order drinks and something to snack on before the game and waited for over 15 minutes and didn't get any service. Were presented with menus and were never checked up on again even with attempts to gain the attention of the staff. He even provided service to those around us and never once offered us anything. Multiple people came around other parts of the bar and were served so we walked out. What a bummer!"}
{"text":"Didn't get an opportunity to eat here but absolutely love the management, especially sal. My friends and I were FREEZING waiting for our Uber and Chico Malo was closed but sal saw that we were really cold and allowed us to wait inside while they were closed. Thanks so much, sal :)"}
{"text":"I had heard from other reviews that the service at Chico Malo could be slow, so I made sure to come during a slow time, lunch on a weekday. People were still seated at the tables. 
I first ordered a Cordoba Cafe, a drink I thought that was at Sips and Sweets. When I complimented Tracy, the bartender, on the drink, she said, 'Oh no that's not it!' Zach, the bartender from Sips and Sweets came out and explained to me the difference between the two drinks.
The Cordoba Cafe was inspired by the traditional drinking habits of Italians. First, dine, then have an after drink. But in tune with the Mexican flavors, the fernet is sourced from Mexico, not Italy, and it's Mexican Coke in the mix as well. Most importantly for the jolt, it also features Cartel nitro coffee. I was impressed at the dedication to the authenticity of the drink, and it showed in the delicious flavors.
The second drink, the one from Sips and Sweets, had burnt honey and spices in it. I encouraged Zach and Tracy to put it on the menu, it was so good that the flavors infused into the foam, amazing!
Finally, my tacos came. The duck was cooked perfectly, not too crispy, and there was a pecan crunch which was new and complimentary. The pork belly was perfect, too (but how can you really mess up pork belly?), and surprisingly the crispy avocado was delectable and one of my favorites.
In addition to the flavorful fare was the colorful eclectic ambience. There is an art installation of a mural made of books by JB Snyder and Tato Caraveo, and an awesome depiction of Frida when you walk in. 
All in all, have to give this 5 stars for service, food and drink quality, and ambience!"}
{"text":"I was heading to lunch and that that Chico was open, so I took a chance. I stopped in after 1, so there weren't many folks. I took a seat at the bar since I was a single. The place is new and very cool inside. Similar vibe to the Copper Blues above it. 

The service was a bit slow. Again not many people at the bar so this was surprising. That said, the food I had, was really good! I had the Carne Asada taco and the Pollo Tinga taco. The presentation was very nice and each was very pleasant to look at. But the taste was even better! Both were very flavorful and the meats on both were tender and juicy. I could have eaten 3 or 4 easy. But kept it to two as the price is on the upper side for the size compared to other similar places in the downtown area nearby. 

Overall, a very good experience. If you are hungry, order more than 2.  But would be a fun place at night to eat before or after the comedy club. Recommended and I'll be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of Chico Malo, and our experience on the grand opening exceeded every expectation we had! They put a unique twist on the most typical Mexican dishes and knock your socks off in the process. One word: NACHOS!!!! This was definitely the first of MANY visits."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great location! Awesome patio! Visited for the first time, after stumbling upon it as we were walking through cityscape and made the best choice by picking Chico Malo! We started with the Guacamole with the Pomegranate in it and it was AMAZING! It was very difficult to chose a drink off the menu because they all sounded great but I chose the Paraiso Tropical and it was to die for! The service was just ok. It wasn't terribly busy or anything either but what they lacked in service, they made up for in quality of food and great atmosphere! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The margarita was really good, and the short rib taco was awesome! I could have ate a bunch of them. Melissa was our server and was what made the difference from a 4 star to 5 star. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Location: Perfect location right in the middle of downtown phoenix Cityescape the congal its perfect indoor and outdoor patio. 

Food: I had 3 tacos. Asada. Al Pastor. Baja Fish. The only thing i can say its that they were disgusting. Asada was okay very bland no real flavor of a real authentic Mexican taco no salsa. The Al Pastor taco was definitely not edible like it was put in some kind of pan after it was roasted you could taste it plus it had some kinda of fruit on it. They did not offer any salsa neither. The \"Baja Fish Taco\" which they should be sued for even calling it that. It had pomegranate NO WHERE in Mexico will you find these kind of tacos. Its a shame not even a lemon that always goes with any kind of fish in any type of Mexican food. It also had two types of fruit sweet paste.... yeah not salsa again... paste. I was even afraid to ask what they were. The famous guacamole was not an option after seeing that it had jicama and watermelon you dont put those in guacamole. Oh and ceviche does not have watermelon neither IDK why they would put that in there. Very weird and not Mexican menu. I would be okay if they would call it what it is and not what its not and thats a Mexican place. The presentation is good they really do look edible but its not Mexican food thats for sure. I did not finish my Alpastor & Baja Fish tacos I could not eat them. 

Its a shame that these people didn't go with the real thing in a location that its perfect for it.  Surrounded by bars, hotels, office buildings, the heart of PHX and not take advantage by offering one of the best things AZ has, being so close to the border. If you dont know PHX and you always wanted to try a real taco Do Not go Here. We have plenty of other places that are near this place. Not worth it for me."}
{"text":"I must say, the tacos here were all very unique and tasted amazing. Probably the best tacos i have ever had. our server was really good and the drinks were top notch. only giving it a 4/5 because it was way too expensive imo. $4-$5 for a single taco is pretty ridiculous, and drinks were super expensive too. I spent over $60 on 5 tacos and 2 drinks. worth a shot to come here and try it out, but i can't justify coming here often because of the price"}
{"text":"Grant + Sal were amazing! Great service behind the bar and extensive knowledge on spirits and food. Really enjoyed their company and their service. Attentive to me and my friend and patient with answering our questions. I had a memorable mezcal drink that Grant whipped up on the fly. From out of town, this is my second time here and would definitely recommend again! The elote is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Giving Chico Malo 3 stars because the service is great...  I've been here 2 times and have had attentive servers who were well versed in both food and drink options.  The menu however warrants 2 stars at best...  while I appreciate the use of local ingredients and upscale presentation I just can't see downtown locals paying these prices on a regular hangout type of place basis...    if Chico Malo makes it, it will be because of tourists..."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out and it's great! Decor is super pretty, drinks are divine and the food is good. Andre, our server was helpful and laid back, no pressure to order in a rush. 

Tried street tacos, elote and lots of cocktails! Good little spot!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out cause it was Tuesday and well Tuesday's are for tacos! Let me tell you these tacos had some amazing flavor! I had the 'chorizo y papa' and 'al pastor'. The chorizo one was great, very comfort food like between the tender potatoes and melty cheese. The pastor was even better with the fermented pineapple!! My friend had the pork belly which was full of amazing flavors, charred brocolini and kimchi with the house salsa Roja! Our server Jared made our experience even better with his spunky attitude! All in all check this place out!"}
{"text":"I was a little wary of Chico Malo after seeing some of the initial reviews.... but of course I had to see for myself. I've been back 2 or 3 times and it has been very good each time! The happy hour is legit. Their food is so interesting and flavorful. The Nichie is soooo good... cheese sauce....avocado fluff..... chorizo..... yum!!! The chorizo and potato dish is tasty as well. The drink offerings for HH are fairly limited... I wish they had some specials on their specialty cocktails. Anyway, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you're going to splurge this is the place to do it. The ambiance. The location. The energy. So edgy. The food my goodness was so delicious It felt like they had a real Nana from Mexico in the back cooking. lol I'm dead serious. The beans and rice have so much flavor. OMG! The corn tortilla quesadilla with Monterey Jack cheese. Yum!!!! I'm a vegetarian so I'm not sure how the meat tastes. lol So bomb. I love it here!!"}
{"text":"Great place to get tacos in downtown Phx. Very friendly service and they offer great happy hour options.  They have a good selection of draft Mexican beers and they have authentic al pastor tacos!"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing! They have a marvelous selection of tequilas and make some of the best drinks I've ever had with it. We had their chips and salsa, as well as most of their happy hour items - which shouldn't be skipped! Our server Joe was on top of everything with helpful suggestions.

Some of their dishes take 15 hours to prepare. You won't find the cheapest fare here, but quality costs. I promise, they will wow you."}
{"text":"Probably the worst food I have had in a long time. Everything that came out was cold and the chicken in the chimichanga AND green chili was rubbery and disgusting. So many better options down town."}
{"text":"Chico Malo Phoenix is outstanding! Our server Joe knew what we would enjoy as he guided us through the menu. Our tongues have all kinds of flavors lingering. #SBC2017 need to come experience this Nuevo southwestern cuisine."}
{"text":"I would also like to add.....as I just found this out from the people I went with.  One of the people that went with us checked his bank statement online and he has a 60 dollar charge on his card from Chico Malo and all he ordered was a fish taco and a soft drink.........plus the one that didn't get quac on her taco's also wants to mention that the meat was not fully cooked."}
{"text":"Absolutely overpriced and unexceptional, have limited bar that is expensive, spent over 70 bucks for me and my wife to have two tacos, 2 beers and two forced open you mixed drinks( it is not a full bar, if you want a mixed drink you have to get one of their concoctions) will never come again"}
{"text":"Chico Malo, what a unique and amazing experience here. I had the eggs Benedict for brunch and the eggs were perfectly poached with thick bacon strips. I wish I had more room in my stomach to finish the whole thing. But, overall best experience I've had in Phoenix and big thanks to Andre and his creation Maracuya!!! Best refreshing, yummy, and perfect drink for The Valley's Hot Summer"}
{"text":"First off this place is the coolest place to hit in Phoenix. Andre, Ariana, teddy, grant, and Zach are the ABSOLUTE best!! Pork belly tacos are to die for. Don't miss out on this awesome spot! 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"The manager Peter will go above and beyond for you to ensure that you have the best experience possible! I came in with 6 friends for some dinner and he made sure that we had a large table to fit us all comfortably as well as prompt drinks to sip. He took his time explaining all the favorites on the menu and even went the extra steps to continue to pop by and check on us even though he wasn't our waiter. I will definitely be returning for $5 margs at happy hour!"}
{"text":"The tacos are awesome. The foodie scene in Phoenix is getting better by the day and Chico Malo adds to that. The staff was super friendly and helpful throughout the meal. My favorite tacos were the duck and the short rib, but I didn't try a bad one. Decent selection of beer and the margaritas were perfect, not too sweet, and just $5 on happy hour. Oddly enough, this is the only Mexican food spot you will find downtown, but it is all you need. Just don't expect to get Nana's mexican food. This menu is chef driven."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and really good drinks. Didn't get an opportunity to try the food because we just ate but it seemed like a cool place to hang out. 

Try the old fashion!"}
{"text":"Ehh - I ordered the Prime Carne Asada, marginal at best.  No real flavor profile and actually pretty tough piece of meat.  Guacamole was very good as were the chips, my wife's Scallops were on Point.  I think I should of gotten the Snapper!!  My expectations were so high because of previous reviews.  Just didn't live up to the hype unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks and good service. We went for the traditional guac which was really good and really hit the spot.

For cocktails, I got the Alebrije, which went down pretty easy, but I definitely felt it later that night. GF got the Abismo Negro that tasted like a manhattan and had a much stronger hit while drinking it. 

Food-wise I got the short ribs which were were so tender I could have eaten it with a spoon and tasted great. The polenta and veggies it came with felt like it could have been incorporated better with the meat. GF got the fried fish which was cooked well, but needed a little something (sauce?) to give it a bit more flavor. Overall we were pretty happy and would love to hit this place up next time we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This location needs to improve on its menu. Not a lot of variety. The staff is very nice and attentive and the location is awesome."}
{"text":"Tacos!! Yes! I said tacos!! Downtown Phoenix taco shop right in the heart of downtown Phoenix. Yasss!!!"}
{"text":"Well.... we are here to see Anjelah Johnson tonight at Stand Up Live... They recommended we try the joint next to them. So we did... we waited... and waited... moved tables... waited... SO WE LEFT AND CAME HERE TO CHICO MALO (my nickname)...

Ok... so we got seated right away.... our server was TARA.... amazing personality... even with an obnoxious guy like myself... she tolerated my horrible humor and still flattered me... her service is amazing.. Ask for her... Tell her Timoteo sent you and she will give you a free glass of water!! 

So we ordered the \"Trio\", for an appetizer... I am the salsa king of Arizona 34 times over and the Guacamole was delicious!! Really good... Salsa... Meh... but the bean salsa was decent... ( www.salsatimoteo.com )

For entrees my wife tried the Al Pastor Tacos and they were absolutely amazing... not too sweet, and not too spicy... delicious!! Presentation was perfect as well... Did I mention the corn tortillas are homemade and made onsite!! Delish!!

I had the scallops... ok... these were the most perfectly cooked scallops I have ever had with the corn and chorizo mash and tomatillo salsa... oh my... perfect....

Drinks were on point!!

We finished with the Tree Leches Churros.... oh my.... there was a big hunk of bread pudding with 2 Churros... and some sauce.. oh my.... sheesh Louise!!

Definitely a keeper.... Thanks TARA!! You were the bomb.com that made the entire experience memorable!!
