{"text":"Ordered the Poboy sandwhich. The sandwich was great, and ordered the Mac and cheese. Having been to many BBQ places in Canada and the states, the Mac and cheese is the reason I'm giving 3 stars. I'm almost certain that it's Kraft dinner velveeta. Not terrible but I could have done the same thing in my pjs in my kitchen. Really not worth spending more than a box of Kraft dinner at Walmart.

Not real Mac and cheese whatsoever, and it was the part I was excited about the most. 

IF I come back here I'll definitely only be ordering a sandwhich and fries."}
{"text":"If you're craving for meat, this is the place to go. The food is excellent and the service is great. Pretty original ordering concept, where you can mix&match your meat and sauces. Had a great meal !"}
{"text":"Now, I've had the real deal BBQ in the past. Bowfinger is \"ok\" BBQ, but definitely not the real deal.

I had the Assiette de Viande (large), it comes with two sides. I ordered Beef and Pork, then Mac N Cheese and Coleslaw.

The beef was a bit dry, they reheat the meat by the way.  There isn't enough turn around to have a smoker running 24 hours a day.  Porc was good but not great."}
{"text":"Mmmm Bofinger's pulled pork sandwich is amazing. It's heaven in your mouth.

Alabama hot sauce is key for that bad boy.

French fries are insanely good too."}
{"text":"We were looking for a \" family friendly\" restaurant to have a few drinks and an early dinner. Most of the restaurants we walked past were quaint, cute French bistros with very tight seating. With a 22 month old, that just wasn't gonna happen. Happened upon this place and decided to give it a try. Glad we did! The beef ribs were incredible. So much flavor and cooked to perfection. Had a Moosehead beer with it - the perfect complement. Kids had room to fiddle in their chairs (patio cushion type seating) and Mommy and Daddy were very happy. Very happy with our first meal in Montreal !"}
{"text":"Ordered BBQ chicken sandwich, poutine and mac & cheese. For the amount we paid, the chicken sandwich was small, the poutine was not that good and the mac & cheese was a Velveeta ready-made dinner. 

Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Food is okay. However, do not order sweet potato fries - they literally scorch them to the black.
Waiting on tables - miserable."}
{"text":"Went here for Poutine week and they were clearly not prepared for the amount of customers. There were two girls coking and sometimes bringing food to tables, and then there was one waitress who sounded like she might also be a manager or owner by the way she'd yell at the other two girls. Service was slow, unprofessional, and very poorly organized. 

It was obvious we would have to wait forever for a table, so we decided to order takeout instead. We waited AN HOUR just to get the food. There were 4 of us, my three friends got their food first and I had to wait about another 15 minutes (all I ordered was poutine). Meanwhile, my friends' food was getting cold, and we still had to drive home before eating it. While we were waiting, I saw two different people get up to leave because it was taking too long to get their food, but the waitress managed to get them to stay and gave them their food. 

Even though the service was horrible and my Poutine was just warm enough to eat, I gave them three stars because it was delicious. Regular and sweet potato fries with pulled pork which tasted amazing. 

I would like to give this place another try on a less busy day."}
{"text":"This piece of heaven is designed to make you feel like you've died and woke up in the suburbs, but the suburbs of Texas or Houston or the Mississippi, unfortunately the cooks are all from here which means it's about as authentic as a bottle of BBQ sauce that says, 'Imported from El Paso Texas'. I had the ribs and tried the pulled pork at different times, if you have ever tried to make either of these things it's not that hard after a few times so when a place says it's known for it, they better be better than the junk you make, and they weren't, too dry, warm and drowning in sauce makes you feel like you had some food from down south but you took the wrong exit. I would give this place a few more years to get better or just give er up and head on back to the ranch."}
{"text":"A place to get an American style BBQ fix in Montreal, nothing more.  They're on the pricier side, but then, given this is Montreal, they're actually a decent value.  They have pretty good pork ribs.  Chicken & beef were dry and hard.  Extra sauce on the side always helps.  I liked their fries more than their meat, though... crispy and salty... really unhealthy, but you don't eat fries to be healthy, so for a \"bad\" food, they were great.  Potato salad was pretty good, too.  Mac-n-cheese was kind of like the Kraft box ones. 

They deliver!!!!  Always give an extra star for delivery!"}
{"text":"Now I know the idea here is to be a southern style smokehouse. But I hate to be the one to break the bad news to the nice people of Bofingers, but there's more to it than putting meat in a smoker and waiting. 

I've been to this restaurant two times, and both times I left disappointed. The idea is good, but they didn't succeed in creating something memorable."}
{"text":"Get ready to use those paper towels!

If you like American BBQ, this is the place.  Great sandwiches w/ fries for a good price.  I dig it!

I grabbed the Beef Brisket Sandwich combo w/ a drink and landed at $10.24 after tax.  Yum!

We got there just before noon and there was no line.  We were lucky because after we ordered and sat down, a HUGE line formed because the local high school students just got out for lunch.  Make sure you get there before they do!

There's great outdoor seating if you're there on a sunny day.  Nice spot for a relaxing lunch w/ friends."}
{"text":"Bonnes ailes de poulet. Bonnes frites bien croustillantes! Staff sympathiques. 
Je retournerai seulement si je suis dans le coin mais je ne ferais pas nécessairement un détour pour y aller."}
{"text":"Been there a few times for lunch. Served quickly and efficiently.

I've had numerous meal options such as the pulled pork, the club sandwich, philysteak, burgers... never was disappointed. 

Nothing blew my mind away but for a quick decent priced lunch it truly hits the spot.

American styled resto that is one of my secret hidden gems in Montreal that I've started to slowly share with coworkers and friends.

Personal favorite? The club sammich. That thing is TASTY and HUUUGE."}
{"text":"I went here for poutine week. Their special was ridiculously good. I went to 8 other places and Bofinger had the best. I grew up in the southeastern United States, so when I see restaurants outside of this region that claim to specialize in barbecue I'm always skeptical. But these guys really seem to know what they're doing. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow. Their BBQ is just terrible. Super tough beef rib. Fatty pulled pork. Even the beef brisket was almost impossible to eat. So tough and tasteless. I'm not sure how they can possibly get BBQ to taste like this. Even the sides were disappointing, baked beans that were still hard. Won't eat here again."}

Ok, I put 5 stars but I kind of understand the lower score. Let me explain the thing in full: The owner is an amazing cook and is very strong to build a place from the skratch but the issue with that small franchise is one thing: lack of consistency. The fact is the Owner had open back in the day in the front Mall of Galerie Des Sources where there's now the Thai Express and O Burger. After a financial disaster (rent was 16000$) the not soo packed place was huge and everybody getting in felt like it was too big and far from the image of the Original (and very excellent one) on NDG. He re-opened in the back side of the mall (Galerie des Sources is freaking confusing to explain for non-initiate but they kind of have 3 sections to it.)  with a smaller and cozier place. the Decor is amazing and it really has an Americana twist to it. old large table with leather banquette. lot of Americana and Rock N Roll decorations. There's a bar and TV's. It's only like 40-60 person capacity so it's way better. When I went, I was starting my diet and cheated that day for the supremly addictive one. The owner recognize me from back when he opened the one on University where I was a regular at the time he opened it. I got soo hooked on bofinger that I completly had to stop. 

They serve 5-6 differents BBQ sauces. South Carolina sauce is my favorite one with Alabama. They have a solide huge poboy. amazing home fries done the good way.They have super large ribs. They smoke all their meat 24 hours. Natural smoking process. The Poutine there is my favorite. They have real sauce, real homecook fries and fresh curds cheese: No by-products or shortcut for a 3 ingredient meal! Should be like that everywhere! 

Je dois rétablir les forces du Karma et remonter ce très mauvais score. Le fait est que les mauvaises notes sont explicable et compréhensible. Ils ont ouvert au début ou se situe aujourd'hui dans le même centre d'achat le Thai Express/O Burger. C'était beaucoup trop grand, le loyer coûtait un énorme 16000$ par mois et ils ont bouger en arrière du centre ou était situer le Rack ultra (A côté su Aikawa) C'est vraiment moins cher, plus petit, plus cozy. Le décor est génial. J'aime les attentions au côté «americana» et au côté rock'n'roll. J'aime la musique qui joue. Ils ont un bar complet avec des tabourets, quelques petites tables et aussi d'autres tables plus approprié pour les groupes. Des belle banquettes avec des tables qui ont un petit côté vieillot que j'aime bien. Le propriétaire, quand j'y suis allé, venait d'ouvrir et montait la clientèle et entrainait son staff. Quand le proprio est là, c'est génial à coup sur. Il est vraiment passionné et fume toutes ces viandes 24 heures à la fumée naturelle. Fait ces sauces du début à la fin. Pas de sachet et de l'eau ou des cochonneries commerciales. On y sert 5-6 sortes de sauces et ma préférés c'est la Caroline du Sud. J'dois aussi dire qu'ils font un très bon poboy et une excellente Poutine (ma préférée). Le fait est qu'ils ont des vraies sauces, des frites maisons (blanchie à l'Avance) et du chedar en grain frais Une recette avec 3 ingrédients où on ne doit pas prendre de raccourci comme tant d'autres le fond.

Le fait est que le proprio est très talentueux et la question à laquelle je ne peux vraiment répondre (comme je l'ai mentionné diète l'oblige) je n'y retourne pas souvent parce que c'est très bon quand j'y vais mais aussi très calorique. Quand ils ont ouvert la succursale sur University dans le centre-ville j'en étais devenu accroc et chaque repas était servit par le proprio. J'aime vraiment le côté Bonne franquette et décontract de l'endroit. Bourgeois coincé s'abstenir."}
{"text":"bonne Poutine a la viande! Excellents prix menu midi! J'ai bien aimé aussi la terrasse au soleil. Je reviendrai."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch. The ordering concept was interesting, the decoration was appropriate and in theme, but unfortunately the food was quite disappointing. 

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The pork was chewy not tender. It felt like it had been cooked and then forgotten on the counter and dried out. The flavor was there, but the texture and moisture wasn't. Disappointing. Same with the fries. They had already been cooked and were simply deep fried a second time. They tasted oily and were very soggy. Not something I look forward to in a frie. I tried my gfs BBQ pork ribs: again it tasted good flavor wise, but seemed very dry.

Overall, the BBQ flavor was great, but the food wasnt."}
