{"text":"Had lunch w/ the fam today, ordered the Thai Chicken Wrap w/ onion rings, so delicious!  My husband ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap which he absolutely loves and my son had his fish fry kids meal.  Food was excellent as usual.  Another awesome visit!  They were extremely short staffed today and were very busy w/ a Sunday lunch rush.  The few staff they had on worked very efficiently and were just terrific.  Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Great place good price and amazing drinks with very friendly service.. We had the 10oz steak and tuna. Steak was cooked perfectly the Tuna was a little over done but still good."}
{"text":"Walked in, we asked if we seated ourselves, a very unpleasant girl asked how many of us, my husband told her just 2 of us so she said to grab 2 menus and sit wherever we wanted. After waiting for close to 15 minutes, a nice lady finally waited on us.  This is a Tuesday at 12:37 and it's not busy in here.  All I can say now is the food better be decent.  Not impressed so far.  Our waitress Sherina was nice and apologized for our wait.  The food was okay, prices were good.  She made up for the first rude girl."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food is of a Bonanza or Western Sizzler. Don't expect much. The location is nice because it is still in the national Recreation area. Beer selection skimpy."}
{"text":"Gorgeous location, will make you forget you're in the desert. Our host was very nice, food came out quickly, and was good. We ordered wraps (very good), bbq chicken sandwich (wonderful), and fried fish (really good, too). Great prices for a \"lakeside\" restaurant!  Oh, and they offer a military discount!!"}
{"text":"Come to this place all the time. The fish, birds and if you're social all the tourist you meet while having lunch. My roommate and I split the season pass for lake mead and national park. The service is a little slow but always nice. I'd suggest just working on wiping tables - I know I chose the dirty table but ya told me to pick one on this side and i did want to sit next to the water. Buttt you can come by before the food is served to wipe it down."}
{"text":"We have now spent 30 minutes driving through different parking lots and still can't find a sign for a restaurant. We called but the directions were also mediocre.  Now we need to find somewhere else to find dinner."}
{"text":"I know I haven't lived in Vegas long enough to declare this, but since it's the Internet and I can do whatever I want, I'll go ahead and say it: The Boat House is one of the best kept secrets in the city!  I know it's a bold statement, and yes, it does require a few qualifiers.  First of all, it's technically not in Vegas at all, it's in Boulder City.  The fact is, it's just a quick drive away for one of the best spots to have lunch.  It's also worth mentioning that the food is good, but it's only a small part of why this place is special... I'll get to that.  Let me warn you, this place is tucked away at the end of a dock at Lake Mead Marina, so to get here you'll have to pay the park fee.  I think it's something like $8 a car, which makes it a more expensive lunch, but totally worth it.  My wife and I have recently purchased the annual national park pass so we can come here as much as we want without paying the fee each time. If you enjoy the restaurant and everything the area has to offer, I recommend investing in this as well.  The main reason to drive all this way to eat in a recreational area is the view.  I'm sure I'm capable of describing the wonderful mountainous area, with its clear skies and colorful lake to you. I could talk about the animals, and their habitats.. But somehow I don't think my words are enough to even begin to describe the beauty of this place.  And you can have lunch here, right over the water, at the end of the dock, overlooking the beautiful lake.  Don't expect elegance, however.  This place wears it's age like an old sweater, frilling but functional. It looks like it was built in the 70's and never updated.   But don't let that fool you, the cooks know how to run their kitchen. The food looks and tastes like it was made with love. Their vast menu will overwhelm you with possibility, and sometimes that's a very welcome feeling. Here, it definitely is, because all of the menu items seem pretty enticing and everything is so reasonable. It's like the menu was frozen in time as well.  You can get a huge lunch for well under $10. Now I hope the folks at The Boat House don't read this and jack up the prices, but this place is probably the best value around.  I've tried a few different things and I haven't been let down. The grilled BBQ chicken sandwich, the catfish sandwich, both great.  Lately my wife and I have been splitting the club sandwich (avocado added) because it's such a generous portion and we both like this plate the best anyway.  Nothing too unique about it, it's a standard club, but thicker and more stately than your average deli place.   No matter what though, you have to order some onion rings or hush puppies for an appetizer. These things are exceptional. Really, you just have to trust me on this.  And make sure you ask for their ranch to dip them in.  They will bring you out a squeeze bottle for you to serve yourself (the way it should be).  The servers are always friendly and happy to see you.  We always come for lunch around 1pm and are usually the only ones there. The most I've ever seen is three tables.   It's usually pretty hot out so we take a table inside by the window.  The best way to experience this place, however, is outside on the patio.  You get to eat right out on the water, and the servers don't seem to mind at all.  For the low price, good food, great service, and phenomenal views this place offers, you really can't go wrong with making a trip out here as often as you can."}
{"text":"The fish is excellent and the view is excellent. I'd suggest sitting outside if you can if you can deal with the ducks. They are all over the place and will sit and beg like puppies. Beer selection here is nothing special."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Can't say enough good things about the setting, the food, and our delightful server Joy. We say right on the water and were able to have lovely interactions with the resident ducks and giant fish. We had some drinks from the bar and shared cod and a burger. The quiet setting with the clear water and mountains as a backdrop made for a perfect lunch and a great time at Lake Meade. Keep in mind you will have to pay $20 to get to this restaurant as it is past the entrance to Lake Meade park. Joy was very accommodating with great recommendations and even took some photos too!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Just left this place and figured after an hour of paddling to get my family some food and relax. NOPE!!! They said they had a group coming in and they would not be able to service us because they would be too busy. REALLY?!?!?  You can service 3 people because your cooks will be too busy. Ridiculous. Never will I go here or EVER recommend this place. They literally had 1 other family there eating."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed being here. We sat outside and enjoyed watching the giant carp and ducks swim around us. The server was super nice as well. The food is what you'd expect and I could honestly make WAAAY better food at home. The outdoor furniture was a little dirty too. The wait time was very long, but I don't know if that was a bad thing because it was so nice just being there and enjoying the water and scenery. Will probably be back here soon."}
{"text":"We've been here before and the atmosphere was great - such entertaining and fun staff - a great laid back place to dine on the lake. For some reason it seems like the atmosphere has changed - the staff didn't seem to be allowed to have fun with the patrons (laugh, joke, play music like normal). Did management change or something? We hope the next time we visit it's back to normal."}
