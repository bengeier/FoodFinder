{"text":"Omg the BEST tandoori chicken, wow!!! We visited this small place during the Jazz Festival in Toronto. We were not disappointed. You have to be ready to wait just a bit, but do it!!!!! Get extra rice and some Naan bread, and you will be happy, happy!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that this restaurant would receive five stars if it weren't for the wait time before I go any further let me just note that the food is absolutely delicious and they have a regular amount of customers or repeat offenders.

I would take a guess and say that the majority of their customers are ordering through just eat.ca or having a pick up order. In their defense we arrived with a party of four on a Sunday evening when there weren't that many people inside but there was heavy traffic of customers going in and out not to mention deliverymen coming in and out as well sending orders throughout the beaches.

We got there at 6:30 and ordered at approximately 645 and then received our dinner for 730, now mind you we were quite hungry so the wait seemed longer but again I have to emphasize the fact that it was worth it because the food was very good but in the future I would probably not sit down to order or visit the restaurant but just take out. If you do come to the restaurant to eat come during a weeknight or a weekend afternoon it seems that weekend evenings are the busiest.

One of our party ordered the butter chicken and said it was very good although had nothing to compare to doesn't matter it was still very good. The eggplant dish was also quite good, the portions don't seem that big but halfway through you feel quite full.

The lamb curry dish was average not amazing but still good, not quite the best if you want something that will be absolutely amazing I recommend Little India on Gerard and Coxwell for this restaurant is still quite good the only downfall is the wait time.

The server was extremely friendly and seems to be quite used to the fact that customers tend to complain about the wait times, that aspect is not his fault, he's on the outside if you want to direct any complaints I suggest going to the source, the chefs.

All in all I do recommend this restaurant but it has its place as a take out, if you need a sit-down meal on non-busy hours give it a go, their food is very good!"}
{"text":"The butter chicken was to die for... Baigan Bhartha was amazing... the breads were fabulous...

I couldn't find one thing wrong with this restaurant.

It is a hidden gem in the beaches area... make sure you drop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery with \"Just-Eat\" web site.  Our various dishes were yummy with musical spice combinations and tasty ingredients.  Excellent delivery option if you live in the \"Beach\" neighborhood.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Our usual place we order from was closed for the day, so we decided to order from Delhi Bistro on Just Eat since it got some pretty good reviews and was one of the *Toronto Loves* favourites. 

Our food came an hour after we ordered, and then when when the delivery guy came to the door he complained that we lived too far. We live 5 km from the store. If you don't want to deliver, don't have it as an option. I don't think 5 km, which is about a 15 minute drive is too far. Not even an apology for being an HOUR late. Never will we order from here again, sticking to Sher-E-Punjab."}
{"text":"As I am starting to cook Indian at home...figured I,d visit the pros.  Went for lunch tried the lamb vindaloo...was warned it was hot.  Should have listened. Drank two gallons of water and blew my nasal cavities out.  Delicious!  Waiter gave me a kinda of overview, but the best advice was - come for dinner and observe and smell what the other patrons are ordering.  Otherwise the variations, subtleties and names would be too daunting for a newbee like me.  Will do!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING, prices are worth it. It is a small place, best to go at times when it's not as busy so you can enjoy it more. Otherwise the alternative is takeout. The service isn't the friendliest but it is fast!"}
{"text":"Hands down THE best Indian restaurant in Toronto and the GTA! 

I recently discovered Delhi Bistro and i'm kicking myself for not going earlier. Everything made for a complete, pleasurable, dining experience. We started with the most amazing onion bhajis and prawn poori. Both were really fresh and tasted homemade - not a hint of frozen food. We then moved on to our mains. We shared saag mushroom, vegetable jalfrezi and paneer makhani (SOOOO good!). Nothing was oily, tasteless or too spiced. Every dish was pure perfection. I know it's not good for the wallet to dine out every night but this place officially has me addicted. I dream about the food. 

The restaurant itself was tastefully decorated. Modern and not at all tacky like many Indian restaurants. It had a nightclub/lounge vibe that was a refreshing change from other Indian bistros. The server was absolutely fantastic. His is was Luis and if you get him serving your table, you won't have single thing to complain about. He was knowledgable about all the dishes (we had many, many questions) and his recommendations were spot on! Thank you again, Luis!

I will definitely be returning to Delhi Bistro and bringing everyone I know because I feel like I have found such an amazing place and it should not be kept a secret. 

Thanks for teaching me what REAL Indian food should taste like."}
{"text":"OK, update to this place as I went in for dinner the other night.

It was fantastic!
Now I'm a big butter chicken fan. There are a few ways to make it I suppose, and I like it when it's a bright orange colour and really creamy. I've seen it down where it's darker orange, almost a brown, and I don't like it as much. I don't know what the difference in preparation is, but I like the bright orange version, and theirs was delicious.

We also had Chicken Xanatti (sp?) Currey (which was a coconut curry based dish). Fantastic. 

We had Lamb Rangonjosh (sp?). Fantastic.

We had another dish of new potatoes prepared with sauce. Fantastic.

We had butter naan (I think I got that one's spelling right). Fantastic.

We opened with those deep fried onions appetizer (I don't remember what they're called). Fantastic

I'll be back to this place for sure. It was delicious.

Dish prices are good too. I know it's designed to share, but most of the individual dishes were probably between $9.99 and $14.99. So you get 2-3 dishes for two people and you're good to go. 

I took my mother here as she was visiting town and we over ordered just for fun to try more items. We ordered 4 dishes, the appetizer onions, and there was WAY MORE than we needed. I took it home and had a huge lunch the next day!

It was a little spicier than I normally like it (I'm weak with spices), but perhaps it's as simple as telling them to hold some of the spice (I used to be able to do that at my favourite Indian restaurant in Vancouver, I'd just say \"Spice level zero please\" and it would come out very mild.)

Anyway, I love Indian food and I'll be here again for sure.

Win!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have tried many Indian restaurants in the city and this is still our favourite. We have had to wait longer than we would have liked for our food on a few occasions but when it arrived the wait is always forgotten because the food is so good! The Fish Biryani is insanely good and is our favourite. It's more expensive than some other Indian spots we visit but the Decor/Service is also more upscale."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Everything I've ever ordered has been amazing. The dining lounge is large and clean and the service is good."}
{"text":"I have been to many indian restaurants around town and wanted to try this place based on the good reviews. I ordered the Aloo Gobi, Naan and Chicken Tikka Masala. I was actually surprised that the Chicken Tikka had a kick to it considering this place is in the Beaches were most people like things \"mild\". I really like spice, so I was very pleased. Everything tasted fresh and smelt delicious. The atmosphere was quite nice as well, chic and sophisticated. My only complaint was that the service was quite slow. It took a long time to get our food, but I think that's because there were a few orders ahead of our table and a lot of people were coming in to do take out. I definitely recommend this place if you are looking to try some really good Indian food."}
{"text":"We placed an order for delivery. The dishes were DELICIOUS and authentic - the vindaloo was spicy, the madras was medium etc.  Delivery took awhile, approx 2 hrs - we were told 1.5 hrs when we ordered, but we're not complaining - it was a weekend night and the food was worth the wait. We will order from them again!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian I've had in the area. I've tried two other places nearby and wasn't impressed. This was delicious, everything. Had the butter chicken, aloo gobi, garlic naan, pulao, and the fish appetizer - which was my favourite. Very crispy outside and perfectly spiced, and light and delicate inside, it was so good. The other dishes were that pleasing array of flavours you always expect with old favourites - but are often left disappointed - this time they delivered. 
No tummy aches later, and the leftovers were just as good the next day!"}
{"text":"The prawn puri appetizer: succulent crustaceans and a Goan-inspired, onion and tomato masala sauce (with just enough heat), consummate their marriage in a bed of that delicious deep-fried Indian bread, the puri. Orgasmic pleasure for Indian seafood lovers. 

The other standout was the dum parda biryani, which though overspiced on the first try was perfect on the next visit. Basmati (Sanskrit for \"The Fragrant One\") rice comes to you cooked in a clay pot with a lid of naan dough baked on. Rip open the bread and a cloud of steamy subcontinental spice fills the air. In the pot, long slender rice cavorts with meaty bits of lamb (my preference for a biryani - you could try chicken, beef or shrimp) - it is quite the ballet.

I like to test restaurants that claim to cook Goan food. Vindaloo, that great spicy-sweet-sour pork dish so beloved of Goans is almost always a failure in every Indian restaurant - a weird facsimile composed of fire and vinegar - that bears no resemblance to the real thing.

Here, I tested DB's Xacuti, a Goan standard that is dominated by the taste notes of roasted coconut and poppy seeds in a ground coriander seed and cumin masala. The dish was tasty enough, but it was no Xacuti - those critical roasted flavours were sadly missing. 

All in all, this is a good Indian restaurant. 

And if you only eat the prawn puri and the biryani, you'll leave happy."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out for dinner in with friends.

Pastry around the veggie samosas was light and fluffy ($3.99) and the chicken pakora was battered perfectly ($5.99).

We also ordered the Butter Chicken, Aloo Gobi Adrak Masala, and the Lamb Roganjosh. Dishes range between $9-$14.

Very pleased with the quality and flavour of food.

4-stars because the price point is a bit higher than other delicious Indian restaurants (say, in Little India) and also the Naan bread was the smallest portion I have ever seen."}
{"text":"July, 2015

First of all, I'm not Indian and don't eat Indian food often.  Anyway, I really enjoyed the dinner here.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm Asian and I like Indian food, especially all the herb and spices!  The stronger smell it is, the more I would die for!  

I rarely come to this area.  Today was a good chance for me to have some nice Indian food in the Beach neighbourhood.  If it wasn't my husband who wanted to be spontaneous haha :D Sounds funny right!?  We came far away from home. Almost 10 kms. just to do laundry.  Our comforter doesn't fit in our washing machine (--\").  Anyway, we like to take a walk and have a dinner while we're waiting for our laundry as we always do once a month.  Isn't it an interesting activity for a couple? :)

Ok. Come back to Delhi~ we ordered \"BUTTER CHICKEN ($12.99) and MADRAS CURRY with FISH fillets ($13.99)\" They didn't come with any bread or rice so we also ordered Garlic NAAN ($2.99) and Rice PULAO ($3.99).  The food was terrific!  We loved it so much.  Butter chicken was creamy and sour. The Madras curry was filled up with a ton of fish fillets.  The waiter recommended this dish if I wanted to have fish.  He said Madras normally was spicy and went well with fish.  I listened to him :) and I like it.  Anyway, for my taste, it wasn't that spicy.  The waiter noticed and offered to bring me chopped fresh chilli on the side.  Thank you for caring.  

The restaurant was a small to medium size.  They have an opened kitchen that you can see what they're doing inside.  There were not many customers when we were there but I believe that they have regular customers here.  

At first I felt the price was a bit pricey but after those things went into my stomach I couldn't say that anymore.  It was filling and great!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. We ordered the appetizer sampler, followed by sides of rice, garlic and butter naan, and spinach with cheese. For our mains we had Tandoori Chicken and the Chicken Tikka Angara. The food was all really fresh, perfectly prepared, and served piping hot, as it should be. I loved my Delhimartini. They have small but good selections of wines and beers, too. See my photos for the food. Service was attentive, and friendly. Not one complaint here. This ranks among the best Indian food we have had in Toronto."}
{"text":"It was my husbands birthday and we wanted to just relax and lounge at home with some great curry and a couple movies.  SO glad I ordered from these guys!  And we will totally order from them again! We order a Lamb Vindaloo and it was perfect for real spice (not Americanized spice), Bhindi Ana, Rice, Garlic Naan, Pompadams and got a free Appetizer coupon off their website so we also got an order of samosas.  Everything was delicious, fresh and had perfect spice.  The delivery guy was super nice too!  I'd love to go check it the restaurant some time.  Overall A+!!!!"}
{"text":"I come from U.K.  This is the best curry I've had in Canada.
I had the Biryani - superb.  Naan bread unbelievable.
Onion bhaji just like at home.   Son has the Balti and said it was awesome.
Service great.  Price quite reasonable.
My new go to curry house in Toronto."}
{"text":"The waiter was hot AND nice so this place automatically gets 3 stars just for that. 
The food was good-surprisingly spicy for an Indian resto in the beaches. 
The naan was alright, not the best I've had, but not the worst. 
We ordered the prawn and dal makhni, and although both are creamy dishes and we were definitely full, it wasn't a \"I'm so disgusted with myself, how did I just eat all that creamy crap?\" kinda full. 

The vibe is quite classy, not your average Indian restaurant or beaches vibe. 
The owner even came to ask how everything was at the end. 

Worth checking out."}
{"text":"The place is clean, and I really love their vegetarian options. The server was so pleasant as well as the service. It's fancier than the other Indian place i go to. Will recommend this Indian place if you're around the beaches!"}
{"text":"Did take out couple of times but the food alway seems better while dining in. Not to say that take out isnt good but you can really taste the difference of hot food vs warm takeout. 

Give this place a try.
The Dum Parda Biryani is really really good.

The server was really good ay explaining the dishes and recommendations of portion size was honest, which I really appreciated."}
{"text":"Props to the chefs for making really delicious food. I had a lamb madras and a rasmalai as well. No complaints! 

If it wasn't for the terrible attitude that the waiter gave me, I would definitely go back.

I was there with some friends to celebrate my birthday. Some of my friends had to leave early because of other engagements so they paid before the rest. We were told at the END of the dinner, that a split bill was not possible.

The waiter apparently wrote down the price my friends paid BEFORE tax and tip and accused my friends for not paying tax and left. 

I ordered a serving of naan and my friends and I ordered a couple more to share so I told the waiter that I needed to pay for that 1.5 servings. He asked me rudely how he would do that. So in response, I said well, what is a half of one? Before I could even finishing helping him out with the math, he said \"okay, you're giving me attitude...blahblahblah... I'm not even supposed to help you pay individually but I am so blahblahblah.\" I was just so taken aback by his reaction to me that I didn't know what to say at first! Then I calmly said, you asked me how, so I was helping you do the math. Then he raised his voice and said that I should look at the price myself and tell him how to do it. But with the combination of having bad eyes and the receipt being upside down, I told him I couldn't. He gave me a dirty look and started calculating using his iPhone.

If I hadn't been watching him and told him to change the price he wrote on the receipt, he would've written all of our prices as before tax even though we paid tax and tip. I don't know how to explain this well enough but essentially, the guy was trying to get more tip from us but in a very sketchy way.

I would never go back in a million years. I apologize to the chefs, because they're the ones that deserve tips for cooking good food. But with service like that on my BIRTHDAY, EFF THAT SHIZ."}
{"text":"really enjoyed the chicken Tikka masala. My litmus test for Indian restaurants is usually the butter chicken and Naan but I opted out this time because I wasn't really in the mood. 
only 1 server on the floor during dinner is probably not the best idea but we were sat and received our meals within 25 mins which was totally fine because the food was worth it. Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is very nice. 
good luck Delhi bistro!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here as our usual beaches spot was closed. Was very pleasantly surprised food was delicious, not greasy at all and so flavorful. Naan bread better than most I've had we also had chicken tikka masala (amazing), lamb saag (rich and delicious) and bindhi which I usually am not a fan of but loved their preparation of it. I have to say my 'local usual' now has some pretty stiff competition! Service was great, very helpful staff. Well done Delhi Bistro!!"}
{"text":"Came here for valentines.  Service staff was really nice, however the food took a long time.  I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food for \"The Beaches Set\".  PM if you don't get what I mean!  ;)

Chefs are Indian, waiter looked Indian-ish, restaurant was contemporary and clean, but prices are somewhat high just because they don't include rice/naan.  A bowl of rice on its own was $3.99, but it was a good 2-3 servings.

I went for a bday dinner and arrived late with my bf.  Since we were leaving early, I asked if we could be put on a separate bill.  And the waiter said that groups of 6+ people are put onto 1 bill.  Water was refilled throughout the dinner.

My only criticism was the paying of the bill at the end of dinner.  Since everything was put onto 1 bill, people were leaving at various times, each individual had to go up, and pay their own portion.  So it did get a bit messy.

At one point, the waiter who was separating the bills short-changed my bf and said to the bday girl, \"Don't give me attitude\".  I'm pretty sure the bday girl didn't say anything do prompt this response.

I understand that separate bills gets messy, but wouldn't it have been easier than doing math at the end of the meal?  And wouldn't the waiter end up getting MORE tips??

Not a pleasant way to wrap up a celebration.  I think I'd rather risk a stomach ache and dine in Little India or elsewhere with equally good food.  I'm sure they'd have the sense to offer separate billing.

There was also a \"hostess\" who was there, but she did absolutely nothing, so I'm not sure why she was even working that night.  She sorta faded into the background as soon as each person went up to pay their portion."}
{"text":"I really like the mutton roganjosh. The meat was tender and the gravy was authentic and spicy. By spicy, I mean a rich flavour of spices and not just an extra dose of chilli powder."}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times.  The food is consistently great!  Try the piri piri fish - one of our favourites."}
