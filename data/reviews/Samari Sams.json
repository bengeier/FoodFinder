{"text":"Pretty good to average depending on who was working. Sadly this location has closed. 7/2010.  There is a Yogi's Grill here now. ok at best. There is a Sam Sams at 100th st and Via Linda that is always pretty good."}
{"text":"Home of teriyaki made in industrial plants and low grade rice for non-asians.  One thing saves it from two stars, and that is being able to get dark meat chicken in your ricebowl for less than white meat.  Leave the white meat to the tourists and walk with me on the darkside of the bird, my brothers and sisters."}
{"text":"The employees are kind and hard working. The service here is outstanding. My favorite is always the teriyaki chicken!!"}
