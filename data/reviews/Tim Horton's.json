{"text":"This location SUCKS. Customer service treats you like it's your fault they rolled out on the wrong side of the bed. No matter how unclear they are, if you mishear what they say they get SUPER annoyed. I understand if I was super rude or completely thick but what? Why isn't Tim Hortons making sure anyone working as a cashier actually knows how to treat a customer and receive orders? On top of all the rudeness they charged me for two Iced Capps. Really? They're mad at me for misunderstanding but it's fine for them to. Even more pissed off that when I said thank you (despite the repulsive customer service) I got no response-- ha! Never coming here ever again."}
{"text":"The staff here are what make this location so great. Mary who works the morning shift is amazing. So kind and thoughtful. She really is the most exceptional staff person I've ever come across - Tim Hortons is lucky to have her.   Staff are fast, efficient, and always have a smile on their face. Love this location."}
{"text":"Thank you for always putting both tea bags into my XL tea!!!! This location has friendly staff and good service. They also have the coldstone creamery items available there."}
{"text":"Long lines during peak hours. Free wifi and plenty of seating. Quick service with plenty of lines. Lots of variety of treats including ice cream"}
{"text":"I love coming to this location. It's clean and that's a big thing cause some places just don't care anymore smh... Speed is also a great thing here, the line is always fast whether your in the lineup inside the store or the drive thur it doesn't take 10 mins like some other Tim's."}
{"text":"I've heard the boss yell at his mostly immigrant female staff. I was so offended, I left."}
{"text":"They always get my order wrong plus they burn their coffee. I'd rather wait in line for a better cup of coffee then to be rushed through.  For some odd reason my order isn't as bad as long as I drive through."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewer who said the workers here have a bit of an attitude. I think this tim hortons location, and the other one down the street(near teston) have the same owner, and they always seem to get orders wrong. I try to avoid these two places if possible."}
{"text":"Walking on the street I saw  a line of people at this place in the morning. I go \"WTF\" and decide to check it out. Turns out to be like a dunkin donuts. Food was pretty good and the coffee woke me up"}
{"text":"The service they gave its fast but not polite. Just fast: like saying BUY, BUY, BUY. They gave me a coffe and thats it. They did not provide me sugar, milk, anythign else. Not even TKS."}
{"text":"This is just a drive through.  The coffee they brew isn't that good so it's not the regular Timmy you can expect.  Quite possibly it could relate to the quality of the water or their purification system (lack of?)  However, because it is the only drive through in the area, it always has a long line-up especially in the morning."}
{"text":"Good, fast service for my first experience at Tim Horton's. They were still stocked on all their bakery items in the evening. Good spot for those getting their first shot!"}
{"text":"Possibly the slowest drive thru service of all Tim Hortons' in all of Brampton. I avoid it at all costs even though it's the most convenient location to my house.   The unfriendly staff makes matters worse."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons is a personal favorite of mine because of my addiction to Timbits and coffee. I prefer this location since they haven't messed up my order once yet. Other places sometimes don't give me the correct Timbits or foeget something."}
{"text":"I go this cafe on my way to school every morning. Very fast and friendly staff :) And delicious French Vanila. I like here"}
{"text":"Worst service ever and it was really really slow. The bun was cold. I dont wanna visit here anymore"}
{"text":"always quick service and like every other Tim Hortons, always busy"}
{"text":"The staff are always very friendly in this Timmie's, even though it's almost always crazy busy, with lines out the door in the mornings.  Despite this I'm usually in and out within five minutes.  When it comes to a morning coffee in the heart of the financial district, all you need is speed, quality and friendliness, and this Timmie's has it all!"}
{"text":"You already tried Tim Horton's and you either like it or you don't. But just because I've heard quite a few comments about the quality of the donut or whatever, I thought I'd share my googling on the subject (maybe this is all common knowledge but maybe you haven't read this yet). As of 2002, the chain moved from having the stores ditch all in-store baking equipment in favour of microwaves. The donuts are partially baked in a plant in Brantford and shipped frozen to be microwaved on site throughout the day. So if you used to like Tim Horton's donuts and can't figure out why you don't like them so much any more that is why.  Also the \"homemade\" chicken noodle soup that they serve at lunch is definitely powdered and rehydrated. One bite of the shrivelled peas and carrots in the soup and it is obvious. But in Toronto, there really aren't that many alternative options for donuts and the product, if nothing else, is consistent so if you are okay with it then you are okay with it."}
{"text":"I was ignored by the cashier for over five minutes, she was talking to one of her friends and made eye contact with me multiple times.  She made no move to serve me, just ignored me.  I was told when I was finally served that they had no timbits, of any type, available. They also had no soup.  I got a toasted bagel that wasn't even toasted.  Tim's is the only place within walking distance from work. Their customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"One of the only 24-hour wifi Tim Hortons around. Very friendly service. Parking lot and store is not full of teenage beefcakes like the Tim Hortons/Wendys nearby. Pretty roomy. They film Tim Hortons commercials here.   Any problems are not from this location, but Tim Hortons franchise itself, which has been going downhill for a while. This rating was for the location and not the chain."}
{"text":"I love tim Horton but this is my favourite because they have awesome food and it fresh"}
{"text":"Went there for a medium coffee. The woman behind the counter says not a word to me throughout the whole transaction. The coffee is $1.75. I give her a $20. I get back a $5 and some assorted coins. Either way, it was not the correct change. I asked her how much a coffee was, and she hands me another $5. Not a word uttered. So I've still not got the right change. I told her exactly how much change I should get. She hands me some twonies and loonies and finally I get the right change. For a new Tim's location, they're really off to a bad start. If you're going to hire staff, get staff that can:  1. Speak. And I'm not expecting a lengthy conversation, but when there's not a word uttered the whole time, there's something wrong. I just got the blank stare, as if she were a cyborg.  2. Provide the correct change. I shouldn't have to ask twice for the right amount of change. And it's not even like she had to do any math. The register told her how much to give me. She just didn't do it right.   Save yourself the hassle, just don't buy coffee from here."}
{"text":"If we are talking about the drive-thru location (and not the sit-down location across the street), then this place is a disgrace to Tim Horton's.  Sometimes it is just convenient to purchase your tea at a drive-thru so I don't expect quality service, but i do expect at least acknowledgment.   Just came here to quickly purchase a tea. The woman on the speaker had the huskiest voice that it became difficult to understand her. When I kindly asked her to repeat herself, she seemed irritated and asked questions such as \"size?\" \"order?\"  Come on! I prefer the location by Britannia and Terry Fox. At least they know how to greet their customers and respond appropriately if they are misunderstood or the customer misunderstood them.  And if the husky voice could not be remedied by a cough/glass of water, then please understand that it will be especially difficult to understand you through an intercom."}
{"text":"This Tims is truly repulsive, always crammed with people and cars, and with abysmal customer service"}
{"text":"This location is actually terrible but I'll give it two stars because today they tried. Our order is always messed up..missing something or coffees made totally wrong. The other day we got a ice capp with white milk and a rude little 15 year old passed it threw the window and I said it's white milk looks dark? She rudely replied yes and walked away..it was chocolate milk and tasted really weird so i  parked and went in..turns out ice capp machine was down that day and they shouldn't have sold that one...so I said we already paid on tim card and they couldn't refund money on tim cards..whatever so then I ask for a manager and she said next time the order will be free of charge..today we get our coffee and I tell the girl working what I was told to say..she looked confused and said can u come inside... I get that holding up a line is rude and I personally get mad when ppl order 15 sandwiches in drive thru. However it was mid day and they weren't busy and I wasn't about to take my baby out of his car seat just to deal with that BS ..finally a manager came to the window and said it's fine it's free lol we would've paid if we known it'd be that big of a deal..oh well..so 2 stars for trying"}
{"text":"I love Tim Horton's coffee but his particular location is absolutely ridiculous. This is the closest location to my house so I do go here often. The ladies who work here are extremely rude!!! I have had several bad experiences with them. I don't know who manages this place, but I suggest you get this place cleaned up and hire employees with less of an attitude problem :/"}
{"text":"This location is so disorganized.  Nothing says where to line up.  Sometimes people form a single line for all checkouts, sometimes they go right to a checkout that *seems* active.  I say it may only seem active because the staff randomly walks away from a place they've been taking orders to a location that was unused, leaving customers milling around and confused.  Usually you have a mix of single liners and straight to cashers and everyone is frustrated.  A few signs and a competent supervisor here would do a world of good."}
{"text":"I go to this Tim hortons regularly.  On the Roll up the Rim, I won a latte. Just to let you know that if you win a drink, they do not give you a Roll up rhe Rim cup for your drink, only a plain cup. Guess they dont want you to win again!"}
{"text":"The waits are long here . They might want to make there staff drink some coffee . Ice cap machine does not work after 10pm Donuts that nuts they don't have any good ones after 2pm"}
{"text":"The place is neat and tidy . Don't understand all the negative energy from the fellow yelper's about this place . It's not over crowded like the other tims and my order was done as soon the first minute I got there ."}
{"text":"It's a drive thru Tim Hortons location. It's not a sit down place. But has quick service! Staff are almost friendly. It's because of a high turn over in employee's. When I work it's a place to go. When its warmer you have shaded trees in the eastside of parking lot. Or go to Riverwood park at The Credit Woodlands and Burnhamthorpe Road West northside of road. That's if you like nature."}
{"text":"Pretty fast  and the staff were nice. It was hard to place my order just due to the noise in the location. The coffee was good but the croissant could have been warmer."}
{"text":"The worst drive thru service in history. First , the lady rushes us. Then my friends car dies on the drive thru lane and the Tims employee was telling us to push the car. Seriously? Then proceeds to give us driving instructions? I repeat - seriously? How did she assume we got to the drive thru?. Considering we couldnt do anything but wait for the tow truck ,she went on to make us feel bad about blocking the drive thru lane for the rest of the customers.ya lady. Because I enjoy this. Rudeness!       M."}
{"text":"Really speedy service and the Drive Thru lady was really nice with directions to the Airport.   I can only imagine how many times she gets it, but even so, she was incredibly patient.   xoxo M."}
{"text":"This drive-thru is absolutely amazing and unlike any other Tim Horton's I've been to. I used to never go there when I saw a huge line of traffic waiting, but when I did, I was through there in a couple of minutes.   Today, I ordered a number 6 breakfast combo with a coffee. I couldn't get my card out fast enough to pay, and get it back in my wallet fast enough without feeling like I was holding up the people behind me. The early-50s fellow who works there during that shift is uncharacteristically professional for what you'd expect from someone running a drive through.   Management and ownership there seem to actually care about service. I'd give you 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This was right by my workplace so I frequently came to this location fairly often. Other than the rather small size, everything ran smoothly and I even got recognized as a regular customer on weekends. Plus it's right next to a park with a massive fountain. That's a nice way to wake up in the morning."}
{"text":"I drink at least 3 cups of coffee from Tim Horton's so the self ordering kiosks are a big help.  I hope they will have it soon in all Tim Horton's"}
{"text":"I am always surprised at the quick service and very reasonable pricing for breakfast sandwiches. I generally get the grilled bagel sandwich a coffee and donut. And I have become a fan of the Tim hortons coffee. Just perfect in flavor. I can't say he same about their lunch offering but I am reviewing breakfast here so high praise for them."}
{"text":"This Tim Horton's is right near my gym, so I go there often.  The pros:  - Speed of service: with a few exceptions, they give you your food in under 5 minutes, and if it's not rush hour, often, under 2 minutes - Tastes good (obviously, a matter of preference)  The cons:  - The cashiers don't speak English so well, so you often have to repeat yourself 2-3 times for them to understand what you want - They make mistakes in my orders about 20-30% of the time"}
{"text":"A few of the Timmies locations I frequent have terrible service. This one is alright though, a lot better than many of the other locations I frequent. Their coffee is decent, and fairly priced, as are many of the snacks."}
{"text":"***-1 star for always running out of crispy chicken sandwiches around 12pm-4pm and being cheap with napkins. Oh, and lets not forget the day the ice cap machine was down. (I went to this location 7/8 days in a row when I came to visit)  ***4 stars for delicious ice caps! -- but that just goes for all Tim Horton's"}
{"text":"I talk about McDonalds' coffee enough, so I might as well switch gears and talk about my other favorite chain.  This Tim Horton's is the best coffee shop in Lakeview... and it's also pretty much the ONLY coffee shop in Lakeview, which makes it the best by default.  I enjoy visiting here, as it's a nice, clean venue and a great spot for meetings after-hours. After 7 PM, the place clears out and there are plenty of tables to sit and work, and the fact that the staff not only don't seem to mind but expect it is appreciated. There's plenty of seating, so you don't have to worry about being stuck and the regular crowd (lots of old folks reading the paper) never seems to be dense enough that you'll have any problems.  Service is always prompt and finely-tuned. I don't think I've ever had a wrong order from here. They've also got their workflow down to a T - try visiting here in the morning and see how they deal with the exodus of cars that tie up the parking lot and drive-thru. If I do have a minor quibble, the lot has seen better days and the ground is getting increasingly cracked and uneven.  This is well worth a visit if you're in the area, because there just aren't many other options for consistent coffee in the immediate area."}
{"text":"This store is quite big, has lot of seating and is designed to make people staff and relax for a coffee than to rush and leave. There were plenty of staff working to keep the crowd moving. I was there to get a dozen donuts for a BBQ i was going too. I wasn't impressed with the selection of donuts they had as I have seem much more at other locations.   Parking is good as there is plenty."}
{"text":"I only used the drive through and the lady took our order quickly and the service was good and we were out and about within a minute or two."}
{"text":"Fresh coffee and sweet buns...what else do you need? This Timmies like the rest of them is ok. It's just probably one the busiest Tims in the area but it's not like that's something unusual for this kind of place. Please keep in mind that there will usually be a line up. Overall it's pretty clean and service is fine. Four stars is exactly what it's worth!"}
{"text":"I used to like Tim Hortons. I just can't get myself to buy anything from here anymore. I rated it 3 starts because is not as bad. I just don't like them and that Is my personal opinion. But I already see tons of people buying here."}
{"text":"Well if you need coffee, its as you would expect at Tims. The line up is always big and the service is very slow for a Tims."}
{"text":"If you've stayed at the Fairfield Inn here this Timmy's is a mainstay. Keep in mind, they share a spot with Wendy's here and the place tends to be crowded. I've never had bad service, however. It's a large place with ample seating to use their wifi and grab a tea/coffee/donut. Service has always been good for me. My order was up the second I paid last time. How can you complain about that?"}
{"text":"There is a long line-up every day around 1 pm. And this location tends to run out of certain menu items. But what are you doing reading reviews of Tim Hortons anyway?"}
{"text":"A good place for breakfast and coffee. You can enjoy their premium coffee blends. Hang out with friends."}
{"text":"The shop is across my work place and is as average tims as another store. There are plenty of staff working at all time to keep the crowd moving.   The place gets packed at lunch time as kids from school near by folk into the joint. The place has Wendys under the same roof as well."}
{"text":"Coldstone review. NOT Tim Hortons.  Been waiting to try this place out for years ever since my friends in the states started to rave about it. If it weren't for the marble slab, I would have been ranting about this place all day, but since that place is just like MS albeit slightly less expensive, this place suddenly isn't that bad.  I was unimpressed with marble slab considering the prices and the same goes for cold stone but I dislike this place slightly less and if I had my ice cream craving and this place was around, I'd definitely go for it.  No need to give a detailed account of what kind of ice cream they have, but in a nutshell, they have several basic flavors of ice cream and they just mix in other stuff like cookies, chips, nuts etc when you order to give it a whole new theme. It's the gimmick that you pay for."}
{"text":"They have screwed up my food order 4 out of 5 times where I've had to go inside afterwards for them to fix it. They also seem to run out of yogurt and croissants quick."}
{"text":"It's timmies, Why wouldn't I love it. Canada's pride. Taken over by Burger King and now offering more and more hot meals, soon turning into a fast food joint rather than a coffee place. Better than Dunkins' no doubt. I will be owing my udnergad degree to late night tim horton's, so yeah."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Place is modern and looks nice, but with workers who don't realize that flies crawling on donuts is not acceptable. Come on!! That's nuts."}
{"text":"It's a really nice Tim Hortons ! The thing I don't like is that you always have to repeat your order more then once !"}
{"text":"Service at this location is fast. Even when I have shown up at busy/peak times. The line flows quiet quick. They are located in Creekside by the Shell gas station, A&W and a few other businesses.  This location has all the Tim Horton goodies and really friendly service, The only thing that is missing is a drive thru, but since they have a pretty big parking lot its not a big deal. You can always find parking.  Will be back again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Keep in mind that this Timmy's is in an extremely busy location and next the the Sheraton Centre, so when there's a convention in town, it can get even more busy.  Bottom line is that it's a Timmy's.  Your inexpensive breakfast options can be pretty limited in this area of town.  The sandwiches were standard TH's, but the TimBit selection was pretty limited which was what we were shooting for on our visits that week.  The staff was friendly and aside from an occasional language barrier, all of the orders were just about dead on.  The only thing I recommend is that you shouldn't plan on eating in, again, it's get's pretty crazy when a convention is in town - even on the weekends."}
{"text":"They ran out of pretty much everything besides some donuts and plain coffee. This was our first Tim Hortons experience and left a bad impression on us."}
{"text":"This is located inside the Esso gas station. Usually pretty good service. I work nearby, so I'm here often. There's a full Tim's next door, so this one is quicker most of the time, but the line can get pretty long during rush hour. They have just the basics for food, so if all you need is coffee, it's a good option!"}
{"text":"I don't see what all the talk is about. These are average donuts at best."}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons is the absolute worst when it comes to customer service. They never smile, when you pull up to the window they look at you and usually don't even say anything.  I say thank you every time I'm there and they just look away. Never once has anyone said you're welcome. I get it, it's busy but what happened to common courtesy?"}
{"text":"Shittiest drive thru service ever. Never coming back. Never going to recommend. Want to be treated like shit...this is the place."}
{"text":"Pretty good donuts.  Very cool that signs are in French.  My favorite is the chocolate glazed."}
{"text":"If You Like Mayo You'll Love Tim Horton's   I stopped in late night for a quick bite and coffee on my way back to a nearby hotel. Tim Horton's was still open; all the other quick food places right nearby were closed. I ordered a latte and a turkey and cheese grilled panini. The latte was OK. The panini was not.  Ordinarily, to grill a sandwich, isn't butter or mayonnaise supposed to be spread in a restrained amount across the outside of the bread slices? None was. And, adding overdose to omission, instead of the usual dollop of dressing on the inside, mayo was slathered on in great copious oceanic quantities from a free-flowing easy squeeze bottle, atop one single slice each of turkey and cheese. During the grilling process the cheese failed to melt and the mayo, of such there was too much to start, failed to meld with the other ingredients.  The result? A BLT, without the bacon, lettuce, and tomato, but with a crest of mayo so humongous a surf-boarder could have ridden it to score a competitive victory.  Why two stars instead of one? There was no mayonnaise in the latte, plus It was rainy outside and the place provided dry shelter while I wrote this review."}
{"text":"Had my 1st TH experience today and i have to say, it was cheap and good! 1 donut + Large double-double for $2.57?! Ridic! will be back"}
{"text":"This Timmies USED to be open 24 hours and I still wish it was.  Not because they have good ANYTNING.  But because that is the only reason I would go to a Tim Hortons.  Yes, it is better than any other chain donut shop.  But chain donut shops aren't exactly \"the place to be\""}
{"text":"Typical Timmy's... although my server didn't seem quite as friendly as most...maybe just a long day. Service was fine but the coffee was a bit strong."}
{"text":"A little slow today because i think both cashiers were new. . But great service! I always get my breakfast sandwich with no cheese, and the staff offered me an extra sausage pattie at no charge! Definitely made my morning!"}
{"text":"Good selection of baked goods, and the coffee is very good for a chain. Tried their iced cappuccino, and it was very good.  I always try to stop by a Tim's when in Canada!"}
{"text":"The food is always good. But then tend to run out of donuts and bagels constantly. No matter what time of the day you go. As well as the time they take to provide you with the food, is way too long; comparing it with another Tim Hortons. They need to pick up the pace, and get through customers more faster."}
{"text":"Typical Tim Hortons / Wendys shared building. This one is quite modern, the staff that served me smiled, I got exactly what I ordered and the place was quite comfortable to sit in for a few minutes. That's really everything you need in a place like this  :-)"}
{"text":"Home sweet home.  During the weekday morning rush hours, these folks here are machines.  The line may wrap around, but the staff here are some of the fastest I've seen.    They know the regulars and have their orders ready before they've even made it to the cashier.    They're also the nicest group of staff of any Tim's I've ever been.  The \"kids\" who work here are awesome and I will be sad when most of them head off to University soon."}
{"text":"Usually quick service, thou the lines are mess but that how most tim Horton works.  There aren't really any seat, its a grab and go location just off of king station"}
{"text":"I've only been to this location a couple times in my life so I'm sort of neutral to it.  One of the things that is sort of strange about this location is that if you're westbound on Major Mack you have to go all the way to Vellore Woods and make a left at the lights because the road is divided and you can't get in directly to Timmy's by simply turning left from Major Mack.  Instead, you have to make your left turn on Vellore Woods and then turn left into the Esso and drive through the Esso lot to get to the Tim Hortons parking lot.  Yes it's weird and this area has enough traffic with the gas station let alone the Tims and their drive through as well.  Of course if you're going west you'll have to again go through the Esso again and get back to Vellore Woods to make a left on Major Mack.  If you're going east towards 400 you can exit the driveway just to the right of the storefront then.    This time around we were here to pick up a Take 12 which is a box of take out coffee with the cups, sugar and milk/cream all on the side.  This is an easier way to bring coffee out to go instead of having to carry multiple coffees and having them made all differently.  It's a do it yourself kind of thing.  Roll up the rim was going on so yes they did give us 12 medium roll of the rim cups with our Take 12 order.  We didn't call ahead so they had to make the coffee and we had to wait for it.  I mean they could use the pots already there but there's a time limit on them and they need them to be ready to serve others so yes we had to wait for several stand alone pots to be brewed just for our Take 12."}
{"text":"Wasn't very impressed tonight. Had to stand and wait for a while before I was even noticed. That was not cool.. Especially after badminton, I WANT MY DRINK! The lady was super polite when she spoke to me, though, so that kind of made me feel better.. Can't mouth off someone that's so nice to you! Lol"}
{"text":"Went here for a 6 am breakfast. Ordered half a dozen donuts and some breakfast sandwiches. The staff were extremely efficient and polite and the store was bright and clean. A good place for donuts and coffee!"}
{"text":"This place being beside Regent Park, and close to Dundas/Sherbourne, has the assorted lunatics hanging about. The staff don't enforce the 20 min table limit, so you have people buying a small coffee and hogging tables, especially during busy periods."}
{"text":"I try to avoid this location but being so close to home sometimes it's just more convenient.  The attitude on these employees is too much. They are rude when you are trying to place your order in drive thru, they are always speaking another language and ignoring the customer and I swear they probably do it on purpose because 9 times out of 10 they get my order wrong!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place in the morning on my way to the bus. I'm usually out the door in less than 2-3 min with my hot chocolate or coffee. Had breakfast here once, and it was pretty standard for Tim Horton's.  One time the guy didn't speak English well, but he was supervised by another guy who did (so any delay was minor)."}
{"text":"I went to get some Tim Bits in the evening.  I chose to go inside so that the 'assortment' they provide for drive-through customers would not be the ones they have trouble selling.  A lady yelled to me from the till around the corner asking if she could help me.  I started placing my order of Tim Bits and when I was almost finished ordering 50, she came to me with a box and asked me to repeat my selections.  Not cool.  As I was finishing my selections a second time she tried to push other alternative ones.  She works there.  I am the customer.  Let the customer make their own selections.  I wish they had a better selection of staff.  I don't think I'll go there again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I like the terminal to order yourself that they have, but I don't like that the specials they have are not on the terminals. The place is big though, lots of seats, plus free wifi. Don't go during the morning rush though, the line is out the door."}
{"text":"It's like every other Tim's, but the drive tru is the priority, you are better off going there"}
{"text":"Hmm its okay... Maybe a trainee but sometimes they forget to stir that sugar up!! :/ and get that sugar water at the end"}
{"text":"As I was exploring Toronto, I kept seeing Tim Horton's all over the place and I was curious to learn more about Tim Horton, so I asked the front desk staff about it and apparently this Canadian grown business is a treasure to them, so I had to check one out (apparently they are in the US as well but to my knowledge none are in CA.) Since  I was stuck in a hotel near an airport and didn't have time to venture to downtown with traffic, especially Friday traffic and make it back to the hotel for my meeting so my friend and I decided to do some exploring near our hotel.  Sadly, I missed breakfast meal and the sandwiches weren't appealing enough to try. But for whatever reason I got a tomato soup with wheat pasta with sour cream glazed donut combo. The donut was good but the soup just okay.  Then also got some cookies, the chocolate chip was okay but the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut didn't really do anything for me and it was too hard. I also got a Fruit Explosion muffin as an in case of emergency, if the hotel food sucked and the muffin was good the hotel food not good. My friend got the 40 assortment Timbits, which were pretty good and not overtly sweet, my favorite was the Apple Fritter. Something to check out if you're in Canada. And Canada is really green they had 3 different ways to throw away your items. Come on America, let's catch up."}
{"text":"I don't get why people flip about this place.  Yes, the coffee is cheap, but you get what you pay for.  It tastes like Folgers.  The donuts and muffins I've also sampled but they're nothing to write home about.  I can't imagine the draw of this place other than the low prices."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Tim Horton's I have ever been to. Despite a renovation to update the appearance they still can't get your order right. Almost half the time I go there they either give me the wrong item. Tonight I ordered two teas at the drive thru and when I got home it turned out they were both coffee despite being labeled as tea. Often this location is out of the item you want and take way too long to put your order together especially compared to many other Tim Horton's locations nearby. Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else for whatever it was you wanted."}
{"text":"Worst Tim Horton's I have ever visited. Staff is rude and inept at fixing an issue. Used the mobile app for a free coffee, they did not bother to get the order.  When approaching a staff member about this, the response was 'oh yeah I saw the order, I just didn't make it'.  It sat for over 10 minutes ignored. Second issue again with the mobile app.  Placed an order and went to pick it up only to see the store was closed. Staff was leaving and they said it's not their problem I was charged for an order.  I would avoid this Tim Hortons which I'm sure the staff would like others to as well.  They won't have to 'work' then."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. When I order inside, everything is fine. Drive-thrus I get annoyed because they can't get my order right. There's always something wrong with my order in the drive thru. Last time the girl couldn't comprehend what was being ordered and asked me to order it at the window...... I ordered at the window and she still got it wrong..... Honestly can't depend on ordering at the drive thru because they get it wrong and they're quite slow."}
{"text":"The employees are chit chatting all the time. And most of the time they don't have enough varieties to choose from or they give you the wrong one!"}
{"text":"I'd heard so much about Tim Horton's that I figured as long as we (me, my husband, my bro, & my dad) were in Toronto, we just had to stop in & try it.  We decided to have breakfast here instead of paying the exorbitant prices at our hotel restaurant.    Well the food here is good, if a little unspectacular.  My English muffin with egg white & cheese was about on par with any other I've had.  It was however leagues ahead of the ones at McD's!  I guess you can say places like these are solid--you don't expect The Ritz, but you do get consistently good quality.    Good coffee though.  And for that I give it an extra .5 star!"}
{"text":"Nice location for a sketchy area. Everything was clean and service was fast. I just didn't like that the hash-browns were super hard and not easy to swallow. Other than that, no complaints here. Due to the location and the crazy people surrounding it, I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Nice roomy location. Even though it was extremely late at night, staff weren't rude and the speed wasn't as fast as the daytime but, it was fast enough. The store was also clean and everything was stocked except they didn't have many bagels left (which seems to be a common problem at every location I go to).   Add come back to this location because it's located in the perfect spot, near many nightclubs and bars when nothing else is open."}
{"text":"I like this location. It's close to the QEW and it has a neighborhood feel to it. My dad introduced my son to Tim Horton's at a very young age and he loves coming here for smoothies and a donut. This is pretty close to my aunt and uncle's house, maybe a km or two away, so we frequent this location when we're in town.   The service here is excellent. They're always happy to see you. It's clean and tidy in here. There is an adequate amount of seating, more than most Tim Horton's without an attached Wendy's. Everything is always fresh. My dad is a huge fan of the coffee here, so I always end up picking up boxes of the k-cups for him to take back to the States.   I've only tried brewed coffee here, I'm not into the sweet or blended drinks, but it's pretty decent. I've also sampled my son's smoothies and they're pretty good actually; not as sweet as other coffee shops. My son is a huge fan of their cinnamon donuts. I'm not sure what is so special about them because he's never given me a taste!"}
{"text":"It's a Tim Horton's. They're all the same. Except this one has self-serve ordering kiosks so you don't have to wait in line with the rest of the hoi polloi and actually go through the trouble of communicating with (gasp!) another human being in order to get your comestibles.  Yay, technology!"}
{"text":"I went during a crowded lunch time rush last Friday. Had pleasant service, fresh delicious food so pretty good for a Tim Horton's!  Went for a coworker for a quick lunch on a busy Friday at around 12:45pm. The lady that served me was nice and helpful. I ordered the grilled chipotle chicken wrap combo with OJ and potato wedges that comes with a dipping sauce (I chose honey mustard) all for under $10.   Filling, tasty and didn't cost too much. Timmie's is an awesome and convenient choice for lunch in this area. The fact that it's shared with a Wendy's does make it more crowded at lunchtime - forget about the drivethrough it's always packed!"}
{"text":"Tried the Tim Hortons  breakfast wrap and coffee today. The wrap was amazing , perfect temperature and very tasty"}
{"text":"Normally, I would rate Tim Horton's low like say a star at best. But, relatively speaking this one is better than the rest. The service is always quick, which is the only reason I go for Tim's."}
{"text":"\"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results\"  Although I am generally underwhelmed by the quality of coffee and sometimes pitiful customer service I experience from almost every Tim Horton's in the GTA, I keep giving them another another chance.  Looking for a quick late morning meal, I walked down to Tim's to grab a Bacon Farmer's Wrap. The transaction was quick and efficient. The lady at the register was courteous and confirmed back my order correctly. My fiance placed his order separately (also a farmer's wrap). We move to the side to wait for our drinks and sandwiches which were promptly delivered to us. \"Bacon Farmer's wrap?\" \"That's me! Thanks!!\" we each say when our orders are served.   Once back at my desk I eagerly dig into my wrap but much to my dismay, instad of bacon I found sausage.  Now, I have nothing against sausage but when you're expecting to bite into a delicious piece of crispy bacon but instead you're met with a flat, grey, squishy piece of pork you're less than thrilled.  I know mistakes happen, but we both had the same issue!   I can add yet another reason not to return, although we all know that no Canadian can every truly stop being a Tim Horton's customer."}
{"text":"I heard someone mention that Tim Horton's serves coffee... if you want to call that coffee that is. If this is indeed a \"national treasure\" then this is one poor nation. I don't understand how anybody could be drinking this mixture of diluted tasteless coffee, half a cup of milk, and a load of sugar. That's not coffee - that's dirt. Speaking of Ice Capp and the timbits.... hmm, I think the most appropriate comparison is a cup of sugar and sugar balls. If you have never been to Tim Horton's (you probably aren't Canadian), do yourself a favor and go to Starbuck's or Second Cup. I do have to give them one thing - their sandwiches are pretty good, especially the bacon turkey one. Just order it with a coke or tea."}
{"text":"\"Open 24-hours\" - the neon light glows as I'm trudging towards this Timmie's for a caffeine hit and a sugar high. Yup, another 3AM-er here. Staff of the graveyard shift are efficient and friendly.   There isn't a huge selection post-midnight but you'll have your pick of cookies and timbits. Note - I don't believe that have hot food at the late hour.  P.S. Blueberry tea!"}
{"text":"I rolled up the rim, but I did not win. That loss notwithstanding, I love Tim Hortons for its Canadian goodness and simplicity. Dropped in for a quick snack with my wife and we had a toasted maple French toast bagel and a 12 grain (baked on site), along with a double/double (Canadian for coffee with two shots of milk and sugar) and a small bag of Timbits for dessert. Quick service, clean location, and hearty fast food with plenty of parking."}
{"text":"A beautiful Tim Hortons. Looks brand new. Clean. Very friendly staff. It's still a Tim Hortons so the food and coffee is mediocre at best. Three stars."}
{"text":"needs a good scrub inside and out. staff are not concerned with expediency. i waited 10 min for coffee with two people ahead of me. they allow people to order food from express beverage lane (why have one) and the customers leave garbage strewn all over the place outside. while i want to support my community, experiences like this make it difficult."}
{"text":"Service is fast.   However, I'm not a fan of sloppy food. Ordered a chicken salad sandwich and I was disappointed with the presentation at this location. Croissant was so thin and small that everything was falling out. It was such a mess. The other locations outside downtown makes better sandwiches but this location is great for on the go coffee runs."}
{"text":"A decent location to get your coffee or ice cream fix...personally I was here for the ice cream and had a nice peanut butter and chocolate shake, which really hit the spot."}
{"text":"The service is very slow, and most of the time they do not honor the coupons that come in the mail, unlike other chains such as Subway. Their coffee is bitter and the food is crap.  For those who believe this is a Canadian chain...it is not, it was bought by Burger King, and BK was bought by a Brazilian conglomerate so Tim Horton´s belongs to a Brazilian conglomerate"}
{"text":"Good as always ! Same coffee but quick in service as 2 cashiers , ! Staff is friendly too"}
{"text":"Great coffee and the best blueberry muffins."}
{"text":"man I just came back from getting a breakfast there, thought it was pretty quick for them to prepare, then I opened by sausage English muffin and theres only egg and cheese in between...no wonder its so quick"}
{"text":"A place where I go because it is literally right next door to my work place.  A quick fix when in need of food or coffee.  There is a starbucks next door, but who wants to walk 15 mins to go get starbucks when you have a timmies near you.  Recently renovated inside and is always jam packed whenever you do decide to go.  Warning in advance is to ensure you understand that because it is within a commercial area, you are bound to wait in line. though there is a speed pass line called a drinks only line that helps speed things up.  Service is pretty good and the only reason I give it a 3 star is the fact that when I compare it to other coffee places, while service is good and food is standard franchisee food, it just does not stand out to me as better than satisfactory.    People are friendly as well so i have to say it really is more a 3.5 range (sad times) stars and I just do not think I can give a full 4 yet.  I pretty much get coffee here everyday as well as lunch when I get too lazy to go out and hence, am waiting for the moment where this place starts shining and I can finally give that extra star it potentially deserves."}
{"text":"This is the worst Tim Hortons I've been to by far. The employees are rude, they constantly mess up orders, and they often rush people just to fulfill their quotas rather than provide quality service. There are two others in the area and I'd recommend those way more than this location."}
{"text":"Can't Visit canada without coming to Timmy's. Coffee, specialty drinks,   donuts , sandwiches all good."}
{"text":"This Tim Hortons probably deserves a zero but I'll give it a 5 star rating for the amount of mistakes they make. If this business runs on mistakes no wonder they are still around. I am not sure if the manager here tells there employees to puposly forget items after a customer has paid to increase there profits. I can't even count in the last month how many times my wife and I have gone through drive through and either we have to turn around - which is the biggest inconvenience in this location due to the horrible parking lot it's in, or being half way to our destination realizing we are missing food or the coffee was made incorrectly.   I should have known about the horrible incompetence at this location when a couple years back I asked for a double double and guess what I got instead??! A HOT STEAMING CUP OF WATER!! If I was even to scold myself I couldn't even imagine the lawsuit I could have filed. But I was in a rush to get to work and didn't really make a big shpeal about it.  Anyways I try to avoid this location as much as I can, I go to the Tim Hortons just north of this location across the street at the Esso gas station. Women at that location are very friendly and always get the orders exactly the way you asked them for. Not the case for this location, rude, liars and could care less on what your order is, they make it up as they go to be quite honest...  AVOID THIS PLACE UNTIL THEY CLEAN UP THERE ACT!!!"}
{"text":"iced coffee = hot brewed coffee + milk + ice cubes(you need to ask them to give you some)"}
{"text":"Quick and fast service.  Got some croissants with coffee and it was yummy on the run."}
{"text":"Pretty decent efficient Timmy's close to my sisters.   Line up is frequently wayyy out the door (yes that's right: people line up outside to get in line lol), but they're quick so you're never outside too long (which is good in the winter or when it's raining especially).   Service is usually very friendly too so added bonus cuz i can't stand bitchy employees.   Usually a decent supply of treats. Food and coffees ordered have always tasted great, were made quickly and they haven't messed up an order.   Only reason it loses a star is it's a notorious hang out for the addicted to pan handle, so that can be a tad annoying when ur stuck outside in line. Oh and no drive thru, sux when it's a stop on the way home or when there's a line outside.   Otherwise can't complain!"}
{"text":"Renovated. Pretty nice since the last time I have been here. Same regular food and drink as all other locations. Has free wifi, but it didn't really work well, so can't really rely on it. Has some nice seating areas, but not as nice as other shops. Fast service and clean facilities. Not much more can be said here really."}
{"text":"I've visited this location several times now, mostly it was ordering at the drive through. On a good day I can get my order quick as there is no other vehicle in front of me, but more times then not there is quite a line up. A couple of days ago I saw the line up and said \"Hell no...\" so me being the genius figured maybe ordering inside the store would be faster.   When I got inside the store there was only one other customer a head of me, I don't know how long she was there for but I suspect it was long enough, to raise her voice and say \"can we get some service please!\" bare in my mind why I went in to begin with, the long line up of cars outside. To be fair this is normal for businesses to not have enough staffing, nothing I haven't seen before.   Anyways when it was my turn I placed my order, the whole time I was watching this younger worker, maybe in his teens I guess, no name tag not even the \"in training\" one, shirt looked crisp like it was his first time wearing it, not to say it was, he was learning as he stood next to my server. My problem with this young gentleman was that before he handed me my coffee, I watched him rubbed his nose four times, he picked his ear once.   I have allergies, that's what I'd do if I didn't take anything for it, as any sufferer knows your nose, eyes, and even ears gets itchy. Maybe he had allergies. However, this young man should of known to wash his hands before touching the coffee machine, and the cup he poured my coffee with. Now I don't know if all employees are obligated to take a good handling course, I think the law is only one person on the shift is required to have the food handling certificate. This course would emphasized the importance of washing your hands... after touching your nose, your ears garbage, raw meat, etc.  I called over his trainer, I presume she was his trainer and inform her that the guy rubbed his nose and picked his ear, didn't wash his hands, then proceeded to touch the coffee machine and my cup, and who knows who else's cup. The lady at first didn't understand what I was saying, so you know I had to point to young man and with my hands gestured touching my nose and ear then touching the cup.   I walked away with her saying okay she understands, honestly I felt she was just brushing me off... I don't know if she did understood, but I don't think I will visit there anytime soon. At the moment I don't recommend this location. This is based solely on my own experiences. Thanks."}
{"text":"This Tims has the fastest, most efficient and accurate drive through EVER. I frequent it at least twice a week and my order has never been wrong. Even with a long line of cars, it never takes more than 5 minutes to get through the drive through line and they truly work like a well-oiled machine!! Friendly staff, clean restaurant if you do go inside, and so speedy when you're in a rush. Love it!"}
{"text":"Yes, another Timmys that I went to on my trip to Canada. The donuts were just OK. Interesting that they share a building with Wendy's. Would prefer Wendy to Timmys. Sorry my Canadian friends, I am not as big a fan as most of you are."}
{"text":"This Tim Horton's might one day be one of the better Tim Horton's anywhere. It is nice that this location does not have a smog producing drive thru (you have to travel 1/2 k to the next location to find that!). There is a lot for about 12-14 cars out front. Here are a few other pros and cons....  1. The hours are not posted on the door.  2. The layout of the place makes it impossible to see the entire menu from the register. The register is right in front of the door causing a bit of a log jam. 3. They have a nice outdoor patio, but on the day I visited they had not bothered to wipe the previous night's rain off if anything. 4. Major offence.... No Canadian maple donuts here! Actually, this location has a more limited donut selection. 5. Unlike some locations, the staff here seems both knowledgeable and friendly. The lady preparing the sandwiches was particularly nice, and not in a fake, I have to smile, sort of way. 6. The floor has a nice design, but could not hide that they had not really swept up in the corners or mopped well in the past few days.   I will be back. I'll say three stars with potential to be better. In this type of business it takes an amazing attention to detail to stand out. Once you do, the rewards are high."}
{"text":"Let's start with the purpose of this review - this location makes THE BEST iced Capps. I get mine made with chocolate milk and they make them perfect every time. Any shift. Otherwise the staff are really nice even when it is super busy."}
{"text":"I have been to this location quite a few times as it's quite close to work. They have messed up my order at least 3 times already! I have had to deal with bagels with no cheese, not getting the bagel I asked for, wrong tea order, burnt bagels and croissants... Its frustrating to come into work after ordering via drive thru and finding out they messed up your order!! Also when I went in to get it corrected, their staff was on their phone..."}
{"text":"Newly renovated - looks nice very modern feel tonight. People are nice and opens late which is amazing.  Lots of parking space and just a quick affordable meal.  Personal fav: chicken noodle soup with chicken salad croissant with the croissant heated/toasted."}
{"text":"One of the best things about my job - I carry my laptop around and can work from anywhere. Yes, that includes working from home. However, I do like going to my office downtown every so often. And sometimes, I like venturing out of the office for 2-3 hours and working from a public wi-fi. It was one of those days and I cho-cho-chose this location on Parliament and Dundas.   Free wi-fi, nice indoor seating, and a cup of coffee and some good breakfast lured me in. I was hoping it'd be quieter but it was super busy. I got lucky and found seating - a 2 seater. I looked around for outlets - none to be found - which was quite disappointing, because I was hoping to work from Timmies for a few hours. And when you do the kind of work I do, laptop charge usually won't last for more than an hour. So, sadly, I had to finish up my breakfast and leave within the hour.   Did I have a normal hour? No. Be prepared for hobos to walk in and try to find seating. The employees are usually too busy to notice. A hobo came up to me and asked me if he could sit across from me. And I felt bad, so I allowed him to take a seat. He, then, tried to strike up a very weird conversation. While I was in middle of a phone call, too. I didn't really respond, and I was hoping that he'd take the hint and go away. But nope, the dude totally sat and dozed off into sweet slumber. 10 minutes in, thwack! His head hit the table (and almost my laptop). He didn't wake up. In another 5 minutes, he was snoring. And I let out a sigh that he wasn't dead.   When I left, he was still asleep. I would've loved to wait and see the ending to that story, but I had work to do!"}
{"text":"I like this place, but the wifi is so slow I'm not sure what the point of it is."}
{"text":"This location is one of the faster ones I find.  Good crew here, never a problem with my orders. Drive thru goes by quickly as well. Good amount of parking."}
{"text":"Meh. These things are all over the place, and people in Toronto seem to love them, so I went in to try. Basically it's a cross between Dunkin Donuts and McDonalds. Greasy tables and mediocre eats. Not impressed. You're probably better suited getting your coffee from another chain."}
{"text":"Wow I've never been so disappointed at a Timmies. Getting an order incorrect when I explained what I wanted two or three times \"One order of a large chilli and one order of a regular chilli combo with double double and chips\". How that is confusing is beyond me but she forgot the second chilli and gave me a large chilli combo only. Alright. Then the bread was cold. The chilli itself was bloody near frozen on the inside. I complained, she microwaves the bowl touches the hot ceramic and tell me it's hot now. (Everyone knows that unless you either give it some time or stir it all you'll get it a hot bowl with cold food after nuking). Wait why wasn't it hot before? Why did it need a nuking? Told her it wasn't hot again. She microwaved it again. As if it couldn't get worse. After the second of nuking I finally had a slightly warm chilli with cold bread. Didn't replace it like she should have on the second time. Left the cold bread. I was too mad and starvin to just give it back again. Bloody terrible service."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Tim Hortons.  I almost go crazy if I don't get a coffee at a Tims at least once a week.  I stopped by this Tim's on my way to a Yelp event.  This is a new concept store that Tim Hortons has been rolling out in the last year.  Instead of the short term guest who stays for 10 min and leaves, TH (Tim Hortons) has made the guest experience comfortable.  Lounge chairs around a faux fireplace, large screen flat panel televisions, newspapers and magazines, comfortable cushioned booths they even have usb outlets on the power terminals to charge your devices without an adapter.  I like this new concept of stores and I hope to see them at all the TH country wide.  The service here was quick and friendly and this location was very clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"24 hour Coffee shop, people come here all the time because it's open 24/7.   Location is fairly big. Coffee could be a bit more fresh, as well as other locations could be as well.    Washrooms are nasty!"}
{"text":"It's Tim Hortons... If you don't know what that is then you're probably new to Canada. Welcome to our coffee shop! They have coffee, soup, and more doughnuts than you can shake a stick at.  I recommend the stuffed cookies. They're awesome and not as filling as a full doughnut. Mmmmm... Double chocolate peanut butter!  This location is much faster and the coffee fresher than many of their brothers. So if you're in the area, this is always a good place for a cup."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally review a Tim Horton's (what's to review?) but this Yonge and Eglinton location recently introduced Cold Stone Creamery to the store.  Tim Horton's has partnered with Cold Stone Creamery to do this in several of their locations.  Since everyone knows what Tim Horton's serves (cheap bad coffee and sub-par baked goods), I went here to evaluate the ice cream.   Cold Stone Creamery specializes in serving their own ice cream, but you get to choose your \"mix-ins\" which they mix in to the ice cream on a cold slab.  I opted to go with something simple - the smallest size of peanut butter ice cream - no mix-ins.  It was pretty good - not the richest most flavourful peanut butter ice cream that I've ever had - but tasty and enjoyable none the less.  The serving size is quite large for the smallest size in my opinion.  I believe my ice cream was $3 plus tax.  Their menu displays a bunch of \"Signature Creations\" such as (continuing on the peanut butter theme) Peanut Butter Cup Perfection (chocolate ice cream, peanut butter, reese peanut butter cups, and chocolate sauce, served in a waffle bowl).  Yikes - I would like to try this but only if I have someone to share it with.  It's clear that this place is loading on the calories, even for an ice cream shop.  As a matter of fact, Cold Stone \"won\" an \"award\" from Men's Health magazine recently.   One of their milkshakes was named the most unhealthy drink in the US (The PB&C milkshare, which has 2000 calories and 68 grams of saturated fat, the equivalent of 68 strips of bacon).

{"text":"This location is completely disorganised. The staff are all over the place and you'll be lucky to be servers, let alone pleased."}
{"text":"Filthy, and service is poor.  No or poor air conditioning.   Trash all over the floor.  When you ask for an iced coffee you get hot coffee poured over ice and it becomes Luke warm coffee...  Unbelievable.   Never again."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday morning, breakfast time is usually busy. I ordered a breakfast combo which comes with a coffee, hash brown and a breakfast sandwich.   Its good that Tim Horton hires all cultures, gives every one a chance to work but they should put the employees that speak English well in the front. I had a terrible experience with a lady who took  my order, it seemed she did not understand what i asked for and punched in the wrong order.   It was frustrating, by then my coffee was almost cold."}
{"text":"I will never understand why this place is the bomb to people. Coffee, so what....donuts, not better than Donut Plant in NY.....Egg Salad sandwich, hell no."}
{"text":"Last night my friend and I went through the drive-thru after leaving a bakery due to rude customer service. It wasn't busy at all and we figured \"you can't go wrong\" but boy were we wrong.   We attempted to place our order after repeating it several times, and once the one beverage order was confirmed the server on drive-through rudely asked \"what else?!\" I spoke up and called her out on her rudeness and lack of manners. She then passed the order to another server. Again we had to repeat our order several times.   When we finally got to the window a young kid came to the widow and before handing us our drink, he spilled it. There goes half of my drink. I asked him if I could talk to a supervisor. He went to go ask his fellow colleagues and  all we heard was \"there ain't no damn supervisor!\"   Finally someone came to the window and I explained what happened. She said she would talk to whoever took the order and our order would be free. We told them not to worry about it and left.  I understand there are things called bad days but if you can manage job I would hope that you would have the sense to check yourself and take a break if you're not well."}
{"text":"This Tim Horton's sucked. For one, they got my breakfast order wrong, and it wasn't even crowded. Second, they didn't care to fix it. Third, there was no soap in the bathroom. Fourth, their WiFi was slow or kept kicking me off. Fifth, their coffee was burnt. And sixth, they don't have almond milk. WTF. Should've gone next door to Starbucks."}
{"text":"It's still open during all the construction going on in this plaza.   I don't usually review Tim's but this location always has good service and is pretty fast. It's never super busy when I'm there but people are always friendly, even in the evening."}
{"text":"Inconsistent quality and poor service can be had at this fine establishment. They try to go 100mph when they can only handle 30mph."}
{"text":"It's funny to do a review of a timmy's I'm sure. But the owner is the most unassuming, polite and down to earth hard working guy. I think we go there just to say hi to him sometimes."}
{"text":"If it weren't so convenient and right on my way to the highway I'd probably never come back to this location. They have a bit of an attitude when taking your ordered at the box to put it mildly. Sometimes that attitude doesn't subside when you arrive at the window, rumour has it they've even smiled once or twice. They have a habit of  speaking in a language I don't know prior to handing out my order which usually makes people pretty uncomfortable.   They seem to  gather around when I have my girls with me and are so much more friendly.  I think I may start taking an alternate route to the highway and give another Tim Horton's a shot at my hard earned money."}
{"text":"As a foreigner, I had a very unwelcoming experience from the employees here and it happened to be my first time in Tim Hortons. So I walked in here early in the morning to try some Canadian based chains, and as I was in line, I recorded the front and took some pics for memories. Two of the employees scolded me for recording and taking pictures without their permission. Okay, I understand that some people can be sensitive and I did apologize several times and they kept saying that some people can sue me for taking pics without their permission. Of course if I was filming or taking pics of them directly, I would ask for permission but I was just filming the place and they just happened to be in the shot like barely in the background. Like I said, I know some people can be sensitive and I could only apologized for making them feel uncomfortable but lecturing me like as if was an paparazzi and intentionally filming them as I was being a jerk was not cool. Thanks for making my first visit to Tim Horton a bad one. But I had the breakfast wrap and a coffee. Food was great but service was.....sensitive I guess."}
{"text":"Customer service is good, not the best though. It's definitely a good place to come when the actual Tim Hortons location beside it is too packed. Though their down fall is their selection. Unfortunately they don't have a lot of things to choose from as you have to stick to the basics here (coffee, cookie...etc) this is located inside the esso gas station."}
{"text":"A regular sized Tim Hortons.  Super friendly staff.  Unique selection of donuts that you wont always find at other locations.  I love coming here.  By the way if you're going to come here to meet with someone, make sure that you order something. They actually keep up on people sitting around and whether they are ordering stuff. This location keeps tabs on people because it certain times of the day there are a lot of young whippersnappers hanging out and not ordering."}
{"text":"My office loves Timmy's coffee and when I don't have time to run out on my own to Starbucks, I usually join in the coffee run.  Before Starbucks changed the world on how we order coffee, my medium double double would be ok.  On busy days, it's better than office coffee but just barely.  Like most chain restaurants, Timmy's environment is standard and plain. This restaurant is attached to a Wendy's and split in half for each area. There are lots of hard plastic chairs and  it's usually decently clean (except during lunch time or right after).  The drive thru is ALWAYS busy.  I've seen it lined up 8 cars at Sunday 8 am and also Thursday 9 pm.    Anyhow, with their expanding menu, they're really trying to go beyond the coffee runs and morning breakfast fare.  They have grilled panini now.  The coffee quality isn't bad but not great.  I find it too watery.  I know it's a mild roast so I'm not comparing to the Starbucks coffee body profile.  The taste itself is just watery.  Compared to Dunkin Donuts, I do like Timmy's better.  Timmy's coffee has lower acidity and that's why it's an (semi) universally liked coffee.  It's been a while since I've had their sandwiches but they're not horrible.  They're sometimes made haphazardly and skimpy toppings but all of it is always fresh. Bagels are pretty decent.  Nice soft chew with good flavours.    It's never my first choice but it's always reliably decent and does well in a pinch."}
{"text":"It's a Tim Hortons, and not a very big one. This one can get pretty busy during rush coffee hours. I like the big, bright windows at this location. Good to people watch while getting dat double double fix."}
{"text":"I give them one star, some staff have attitude and they are not polite with customers. And their coffee been tasting different he past couple of days especially the dark roast coffee."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better Timmie's as they have a lot of space (combined with Wendy's) and outlets around the store. WiFi is rarely an issue as well. However, the service at the counter is extremely slow. 4 workers for the drive thru, and 1 person on the register when there's a line at around 4pm."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better Tim Hortons locations in the area. Ample seating and a few outlets spread around the place. It's not close to a residential area either so you mainly only get the commercial crowd. The busiest times during weekdays are from 7:30-9:00am, and between 3:45-5:00pm. Saturday evenings from 8-11pm and Sundays from 12-2pm can also get busy. Service has always been efficient at this location with consistent staff (not too much turnover for the employees). The WiFi is less consistent and I have had connection issues here more than other locations. Overall, it's a comfortable experience at this branch."}
{"text":"The service is very bad. They ordered the wrong combo. Otherwise the food was great after we took control of the situation."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, yelled at me for no reason, and even had a piece of hair in my food!!!"}
{"text":"Despite not having a drive through, the service and quality of coffee at this location is beyond any other Tim's I've encountered.  I've been coming here since I was a kid and the service here has truly never declined. They are speedy and efficient and have never gotten my order wrong. Super friendly.  The Tim's itself is relatively clean, few crumbs here and there. The bathrooms however have never been clean at any time. However they're not awful, just not perfect.  On one of my more recent visits I ordered a Caesar salad with chicken and a coffee, the coffee was brought to the table I was sitting at and the guy making the salad was so friendly. He asked me if I wanted onion on my salad, but that it doesn't normally come on it, but he thinks it makes it better.    It did, he was totally right, so not only do I highly recommend this Tim's, but you should ask for onion on your future caesar salads"}
{"text":"The staff here are really quick generally and on the ball.  Everything else meets your standard Tim Hortons expectations."}
{"text":"Never a bad experience at this location. The only thing that could have been better was if they put in a drive-thru here.  There hasn't been a line when I've visited but I'm sure that will change as housing construction continues in the area. Staff have been fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Super large location that seats and serves many, but the staff is rude and dismissive and they don't pay close attention to orders.    So for regulars, no biggie, but for custom stuff, be clear and concise.  Go in for a French vanilla or a donut but don't make conversation   I Recommend: getting in and out ASAP  Extra tip: I'm gonna check out their breakfast service just before 9am. Will report back if there are alarms to ring. Wish me luck."}
{"text":"Forget Krispy Kreme's, it's all about Tim Horton! Yum yum yum yum!  They have a wide wide selection of jam, custard and creme doughnuts! A variety of coffee's with or without creme! Its no Dunkin doughnuts, but it's not far off! The price is reasonable and if your a sugar lover like me, you'll appreciate this place regardless!  Well... I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Another acceptable experience. The lineup was out the door but the staff were working hard to get through it quickly. Once the order was taken the coffee came quickly, but the deli station was slow."}
{"text":"This established Tim Horton's location is busy.  It has been in business for a long time.  The people is fast.  The coffee are average.  The place is generally clean.  The parking is tight in the front, but there are more space at the side.  It is an okay place."}
{"text":"If this Tim Horton's were to select a Huey Lewis song as a theme song, it would have to be \"Back in Time\" from \"Back to the Future\"*.    It took so long to get my iced mocha latte that I literally felt time was beginning to move backwards....and I was the only customer at the counter!  Soooooo sssllllloooooowwwww! ________________________________  *Starring famous Canadian Michael J. Fox! http://youtu.be/PgyvMp5YWcI"}
{"text":"This tim hortons is the worst I've ever been to. First things first, I took the time to walk there. I ordered a steeped tea only to get a coffee instead. And then ordered timbits only to find out they were stale. So I ended up walking back and switching the coffee to the tea... and got a refund for the timbits. No hassles. But when I brought the tea back, I was told there was too much milk and the tea tasted like it wasn't fresh.  Never again will I go to this tim hortons."}
{"text":"Wifi is decently fast, and there are lots of power outlets. Coffee is okay, but the place gets busy before and after work as this is in the middle of a major commercial/industrial park. Lunch gets crowded too."}
{"text":"This place sucks they don't know how to make a coffee its either burnt or not enough sugar and that's at 7pm in the evening when there's not another car in site"}
{"text":"I'm going to go right out and say it.  Tim Horton's is 1000000X better than Dunkin' Donuts.  Do what you will with that tidbit, but it's the truth.   This specific Tim Horton's was the best.  First of all, it's open 24/7.  And since Joe and I did not get to the hotel until 1:00 AM this was a godsend!!! Never mind I was eating the worst thing ever but it was damn tasty and it definitely hit the spot, especially with the hell we went through.  For some reason Tim Horton's (at least in Toronto) does NOT have iced coffee.  ::Brakes slamming:: What?! I don't understand it.  And what I didn't understand even more was that most of the Torontonians that I saw were all drinking HOT COFFEE (ok, I know this is Toronto, but we managed to go during a terrible heat wave, so it boggled my mind even more).  They have these iced Cappachino things, that are basically like DD's Coffee Coolatas, and I really wasn't a fan of them (they were however, cheaper that DD's version).  Probably won't be getting those again.    Now if only they went with iced coffee, they might get that last star...."}
{"text":"Nice place to get a drink and pastry to sit back and relax. Large-ish parking lot so you should be able to find a spot. We used the app to order and the lady at the cash had our order ready fairly quick."}
{"text":"Reviewing individual Tim Hortons would almost seem mundane, considering they are a chain of cookie-cutter food and coffee takeouts. However, each location does hold its own sort of atmosphere, so aside from the food and coffee review (TH coffee has always been my favorite), I'll just write a brief note about the store itself.   This location has always had problems with customer service; mainly, lineups that can run all the way outside the store itself. Part of this may be the fact that they don't have a drive-thru (no room); but the staff truly is just...slow. Often you can be in line for upwards of 10 minutes waiting to place your order, which - in a fast-food coffee house - is very poor service indeed. I've also found that in the past, there have been numerous times my order has been incorrect (ordered an extra-large triple/triple coffee, for example, and received extra-large black). This past summer the store received a makeover, and I was hoping the service would get better...serve people faster, get orders correct, etc. And while I will say that there has been a tiny bit of an improvement - staff seems to be more pleasant with customers now, rather than frowning or grunting at them - the lineups still occur, the orders still are sometimes incorrect. (I would have rated them 2-1/2 stars rather than 3 if the system allowed it...the half-star for the slightly better customer relations.)  If it wasn't the nearest location to my house, I'd go to another TH on Montreal Road - near St. Laurent - much faster service, at least."}
{"text":"Not very happy with the service here today...we ordered a bagel, 3 hashbrowns and two coffees. After our order they said they only had two hashbrowns and would give us a cookie...asked for an oatmeal raisin didn't have that...ended up getting a croissant I didn't really want...to top it off...my mom asked for a medium decaf coffee with two cream one sugar...she got a BLACK coffee with two sugars...not impressed..."}
{"text":"being close to the heart of downtown makes this location good, but awkward at times. the volume of people that go through here is nutty at times, having said that the service is good, but sometimes they get the orders messed up, or very rarely they kind of forget about you. entrances on the front and back of the store makes for easy access, and because of the volumes at some hours its easy to get in and out. make sure to check you're order on leaving! the store is very clean, and the staff are usually good, just seems like they have a lot of new staff very often, which doesn't help the line ups."}
{"text":"a fairly new location, for this area, and the block of new stores that are around it!  great service, great staff and a super clean location.  this location makes shopping in this area a little less painful, cause we all need a bit of spring in our step."}
{"text":"I love Tim Hortons, nothing better than a double double and a breakfast biscuit in the morning.  This location hasn't impressed me so far though.  The first month, they only took cash, this was really inconvenient.  Also the layout really didn't account for typical Tims line ups.  Only 5 people can line up before the lineup goes outside.  This will not bode well in the harsh Calgary winters,  this problem could be solved by reconfiguring the shelves, and line up posts to run along parallel to the counter and turn instead of adjacent to it.  Hopefully someone figures this out and fixes it soon."}
