{"text":"The pupusa flavor in this restaurant was okay. I ordered the plátanos maduro with beans and sour cream. The beans were watery which I didn't enjoy. I did get a discount on the pupusas when I ordered a dozen. I did have to ask if they had any deals though."}
{"text":"Best tamales I have tried in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food but staff are not proficient in English which makes it difficult if you don't know their language, as many of us don't."}
{"text":"Best salvadoreñ restaurant in Las Vegas the pupusas are so delicious and the fruit water they have there called (Ensalada) is delicious. If you're ever in Vegas and want some amazing pupusas go to El Triunfo"}
{"text":"Salvadorian food, Salpicon dish is amazing, very small venue, service is good and very friendly."}
{"text":"Average food and prices. Below average waitresses though, they can be really rude at times"}
{"text":"Best pupusas I've ever had! This place definitely is Salvadorian comfort food done right! I wish I had taken a before picture but was so amazed when I got my plate I just dug in. I would recommend this place to everyone looking for a good home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Looking at the strip mall it's in you would not expect much.  The pupusas are fantastic!  The masa is fluffy and moist.  The seven seas soup is amazing.  I wasn't expecting much when I first tried this soup but it was a pleasant surprise.  It's full of seafood and the broth has great depth."}
