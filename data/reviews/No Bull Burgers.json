{"text":"Another stop in our Wednesday Night is Burger Night Tour. Could be a 3.5. Staff is friendly and efficient. Order at the counter and take a seat. Small place so nowhere to hide from the icy breeze when the door opens. As a result, our fries and onion rings got cold quickly. Unimpressed with the small packets of ketchup and malt vinegar. Hubby had the Redneck burger with a big slice ofpea meal rolled in their signature homemade chips and then deep fried, onion rings and a chocolate shake. I had a 'naked' burger with bacon and whiskey BBQ sauce (very smokey!) with fries. The burgers are big but a bit dry. The rings are average. The fries are house cut and quite good. My 'naked'burger (no bun) came on a bed of shredded lettuce sitting on a paper mat on a plastic tray. Yuk. As I used the plastic cutlery to cut and eat my meal, the mat disintegrated and became an unwelcome condiment! The shake was proclaimed very good. We expected more and were somewhat let down."}
{"text":"Delicious. Had 4oz burger with cheese and bacon. I loved that the bacon was crispy and crunchy. Great choice of toppings. The fries are great but take a friend to share. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"The large poutine is HUGE and super heavy - with layers of gravy and cheese curd like a poutine lasagna! Burgers are good and the salad is fresh. Plus, they deliver!!! Awesome!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there to grab take out dinner on a Sunday night. Service was friendly, food was fresh and fast, although it didn't have the \"fast food\" feel. Great experience. The fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"I live walking distance and thought, yipee, it's close by. The hamburgers  are good but not excellent. The fries are for two, and actually any time I've had them are mealy. Yech! You have to know the place to know how to order, you might get too much mustard, or,not enough something else . I had the beef brisket once and the BBQ sauce was too much and too sweet, then the second time I asked for NO SAUCE and it was still there. So no beef brisket ( it was moist and the fat ratio was spot on) but the BBQ  sauce has to go yech. However, the chips,are great if you know to ask for light on the salt.
In recap, it's pretty good if you know how to order. And the ice cream is the best. The prices are competitive but no big deal.,I'll go back cuz it's close."}
{"text":"My darling wife and I stopped here when walking around neighbourhood. I had a cheeseburger and it was FANTASTIC. I can hardly wait to go back. Very good service as well."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing. The Brisket, burger, and chicken!!! Fries are fantastic. I get everything \"naked\" with all the veggies (there are a ton). It's like a side salad without ordering one! My boyfriend always gets the double cheeseburger, he loves it!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

I've been here a few times and I always order the same thing quinoa burger and veggie poutine. Overall, it is okay.

Food: I was excited to try the quinoa burger and while it's good, the burger breaks apart and is really messy. The vegetable gravy is extremely salty and I can hardly finish it without drinking a gallon of water afterwards. My husband orders a regular cheeseburger and it is always a bit overcooked. The milkshakes are good though. 

Service: While the people are generally nice, the service is slow. I don't know if it's because they don't have enough people working but it takes an age for us to get our food. 

I'll still come for my veggie burger fix."}
{"text":"Earlier tonight while walking around the neighbourhood I'm staying in during my visit to Toronto I happened upon this place. I liked their sign and consider myself to be a poutine enthusiast. Since they had various kinds of exotic poutine it was a signal to me that they take their poutine seriously!

I got the classic poutine, and was not disappointed. The serving size was VERY generous given the reasonable price ($6 including tax). It was probably the best poutine I've had in Toronto (making it better than Smoke's), but I've still had better in Quebec and in Ottawa as well.

Other things I liked: The staff were friendly, they have one of those garage doors so when it's nice out they have a large open window facing the street, and they had an awesome fork dispenser (which scored points for novelty and for cleanliness since you know no one else has touched your fork)."}
{"text":"Always a good veggie option available with the quinoa burger. Nice poutine can be done veggie friendly.  Great for take out."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from No Bull Burgers today - the double bacon cheeseburger, the double cheeseburger, onion rings, guacamole and chips.  We forgot to add the condiments and someone very friendly called back right away to make sure we got what we wanted.  

We were both very impressed by the quality of the meat and the bun;  also, the burgers were huge, these are not cheap burgers that you need to buy four of to have a full meal.  We were both full halfway through the burgers but they were so tasty that we finished both of them.  The onion rings were also delicious, and the chips and guacamole were just perfect.  Delivery time on a Sunday afternoon was about 30 minutes.  The packaging was so good that I had to wait a few minutes for my burger to cool down.

I will definitely be ordering from No Bull Burgers again - these are some of the very best burgers in the city."}
{"text":"No Bull Review on   No Bull Burgers :
Read some ( most actually ) of the rather
negative reviews . ?? Not sure why .
Here was our experience :
After a late day camera purchase @ the
nearby Vistek my 15 year old son & I were a bit tired & very hungry !
Walked past \" No Bull Burgers \" , and decided to check it out . Both fellows at the counter were helpful & genuinely friendly . Our order was prepared promptly & everything had great flavor !
I too am a flame-grill guy , buy that old style diner taste of the flat iron is a nice
change . The owner takes a pride in his
place & cares about the quality of what is served there . That is obvious ! My son
had a burger , fries & a home-made milk shake , all very tasty . I just had a burger & water . The seasoning of the burger was great . I detected a hint of caraway seed . Total was $ 23.00 incl. tax.
My thoughts are for about $ 5.00 more than Harvey's , BK or McYuk you can
get real food in a neat little place made
by a couple of nice guys who care about quality & their customer ...
That to me is \" 5-Star Service \"
Will certainly drop in again !!!"}
{"text":"Great place - checked it out thanks to Rosie's review - WOW the pulled pork with Whiskey BBQ was amazing. A very low key cool spot. My new go-to place for pulled pork and burgers.  The smokehouse special has it all: 1/4lb burger, pulled pork and brisket - for those who can't decide and/or want to try it all.

Definitely a fantastic spot and great addition to the hood!"}
{"text":"My family went to no bull during the very very cold days of Feb. 2015. Food was great; however, they didn't have any heat on in the dining area. By the time we left we were freezing. Conversely, the two gentlemen in the back making the grub were wearing t-shirts. I guess the burners are hot and they needed to shed some layers and who cares about the guests who need their winter gear on (toques too) to eat in a meat locker type environment. 

Suggestions:
RAISE THE THERMOSTAT up a notch or two or invest into a space heater?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought us all the way from Mississauga! Awesome burgers!"}
{"text":"i absolutely loved the redneck burger, probably the best burger ive had in my life. i also got the cajun fries, they were a tad bit salty for my taste though. i will definately be coming back here although i dont eat out often! they need a bit more seating as it was a little busy but now i know why! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Pineapple, olives, and sautéed mushrooms without having to pay extra?  Load up my burger, I'm going to enjoy this.  I ordered a single burger, and it was absolutely delicious and filling--I mooched fries from my friend's poutine, but I would have been happily sated even without that.  

The poutine, by the way, was ridiculous.  $5 gets you a literal tray of fries slathered in gravy and cheese curds--it took three of us to finish it and we still left a few lonely fries on the tray.

The flavour of the beef was fine, but I admit that I was mostly enjoying the toppings.  Definitely get the pineapple; it's so tasty."}
{"text":"Not really impressed to be honest. Food is good but being interrupted by the cashier while I'm ordering to take an order over the phone seems extremely rude. I live not even a block from No Bull Burger so I have eaten there quite a few times because the food is good. I have been there other times and felt that maybe because I'm a 26 year old male that my business is not as appreciated as some of the older patrons.  Regardless of how good the food is I don't feel comfortable spending money in this establishment with consistent poor customer service. I'll also add that every time I came I would spend over $20 with tip for myself alone. If I'm going to work hard at my job to spend money I would appreciate to be treated with a common level of respect."}
{"text":"The burger was delicious! All toppings were no additional charge besides the expected: bacon, cheese and guacamole. I didn't order fries but a stole a couple from my friends and they were excellent chip truck style fries. Next time I'll try the poutine. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it was a tad expensive - $ 10 and change for a burger and water."}
{"text":"Flavourless generic meat, probably from frozen patties. The half pound burger consists of two quarter pound flat disks which is not nearly as good.  No sear on the burger so it was a pale brown colour and all the juices leaked into the bun. They poured on the mustard - it's all I could taste.  The bun didn't stand up to the burger and fell apart into a soggy mess by the third bite. The sliced onions were from the outer papery part of the onion.  And to top it off despite the burger having no flavour at all, I burped up garlic for hours afterwards. Disappointing to say the least.  Note: they don't take Visa."}
{"text":"We just stopped here after leaving George Brown (not too close to George Brown but on my way home) everyone in the restaurant was very friendly even brought us our food which I found nice considering it seems more like a grab and go kind of place. There wasn't too much seating but it wasn't busy till after we left. I had their delicious chips season with parmesan (made in house) and a cheeseburger I really enjoyed it I will definitely return and maybe even try their quinoa burger."}
{"text":"I tried the place for the first time today, after my partner had tried months to drag me there. For what it's worth we ate in. Here is my impression:
If you want to have a burger, this is a good place. This is NOT the increasingly common-place gourmet, exotic, tenderly spiced, delicately-combined-28-unusual-ingredients, pretentious bun and patty, this is a REAL BURGER. It was just simple, fresh ingredients, stacked on top of each other, in a bun.
We also had the cookies and cream milkshake which was amazing.
Service was quick and friendly and we waited about 5 minutes while our burger meat was cooked fresh.
To me, the place lives up to its name."}
{"text":"Still entirely five stars, if I could give more, I would.

My boyfriend and I are here at least 2x a week- at least. The customer service is still awesome, and I just picked up and devoured the BEST poutine I've ever had- the fries were perfectly cooked, perfectly salted, super fresh cheese curds, amazing gravy. I'm really impressed. Sooo yummy"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a quick lunch and were pleasantly surprised! We were welcomed by two burger pros behind a clean counter who recommended a few items from the menu. I choose the veggie quinoa burger and my huz got the double. The beef is fresh and juicy and the toppings were crisp and cold. If you are like me and have a hard time finding a satisfying veggie burger in the city(or anywhere) look no further!  Great texture and moist with a crispy outside....No Bull!;)"}
{"text":"So it was Labour Day and we had no food in the house.  We debated over a few fast food places, but then I remembered No Bull and fantastic, it was open!  I had the Redneck and fries, my husband Redneck and poutine, my mom the plain old burger and onion rings.  The burgers were very good, the servings are plentiful (there was no way I could eat all those fries!) and as per my mom, THIS is how you do onion rings!  As one previous customer put it, each ingredient could have had a BIT more flavour to really distinguish each thing put on the burger, so not quite 5 stars, but definitely worth going back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get your burger craving fixed.  The burgers are fresh and made to order.  The  Redneck burger is a must try."}
{"text":"Love this place. Its definitely worth the price. All the staff there are great and friendly. I Especially love the shakes, in my opinion i think there the best milk shakes in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Brisket is to near perfection....live just down the street so I have had now at least a half dozen times..... Only once was it a little dry....other than that moist cooked perfectly and excellent with the Whiskey BBQ sauce... You can't do better for a sandwich. Great work NBB"}
{"text":"ok. priced alittle expensive, good service. Seating is limited but you can take your food to the greek restaurant and eat it. french fries taste good amd the portions are comparable to other places when you are paying 4.50+ for fries."}
{"text":"We tried this joint out from the reviews on yelp.. We were craving a delicious burger that was homemade.. Well the fries were excellent but the patties weren't all that good !!
  I don't mind waiting for a good burger but the order better be right! Mine WASN'T...
 All I got was a sorry , I wrang it in wrong, so sad..so to sum it up the burger was ok,but not near the quality of Five Guys and the service was poor.. 
  Lol, beware if your not a regular because your portions are not the same size"}
{"text":"Burgers are amazing - especially the Smokeshow!  All of the toppings are fresh and the fries are hand cut!  Will have to try the quinoa burger and one of the poutine flavours next time!"}
{"text":"I love this burger place! I order delivery and my food arrives on time and hot. The meat used for these burgers is so good and they always cook it perfectly. I love the onion rings and the gravy used on the poutine is rich and beefy. 

I also love that you can choose the type of bacon and cheese that you want instead of just getting the basics. 

I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good burger."}
{"text":"I had The Redneck and a Poutine.

I was extremely disappointed with this eatery, the promise of fine organic ingredients led me to believe their offerings would have taste; instead I was treated to a surprisingly bland meal. The only thing I could taste on my burger was the barbecue sauce, it looked amazing but was completely devoid of any other flavours. The poutine's cheese was nice, decent classic curds, but No Bull should consider a redesign in the fry & sauce preparation as neither produced much presence when consumed."}
{"text":"Very tasty burgers with a very complete list of top toppings,  including sautéed onions,  crispy bacon,  and a few spicy sauce options. Fries are great and poutine is outstanding."}
{"text":"Great place! Tried it for the first time this past weekend. It's always nice to find a place that uses organic and local ingredients. The patty is thin and cooked well. (In fact, I would ask them to cook it a little less time than the standard since I like my burger juicy). The fries are homemade and lightly salted. They have sea salt on the side for customers which I think is great -- reduces waste by not using the individual paper packets. 

Looking forward to coming here again to try their poutine and a variety of their other burger toppings."}
{"text":"My friend and I have this thing where we visit a new burger joint to try it out so tonight was one of those nights and funny enough, we found this place on Yelp.  

Location is pretty convenient as it's located on Kingston Rd. where there's street parking or you can also park on one of the side streets.  Place isn't very big but it's good for a small group.  Staff are also very courteous.  

I had a Bacon Burger with Cheese which is one of the simpler ones even though they have their specialty burgers.  I personally like to try the most basic burger when trying out a new spot just to see how that would taste like without all the fancy fixings.  The burger patty was nice and juicy and was also quite flavourful.  A lot of times the patties are so bland but it seemed like they first caramelized the onions and placed those in the ground meat before grilling them.  I could also just be making that up.  Either way, the patty itself was good and I wish it was a little bit thicker.  The bacon was perfection.  God bless that magical animal.  With my burger I ordered No Bull Chips with parmesan seasoning.  Chips were freshly made and cooked to a golden crisp.  Was a little on the salty side but it was nice.  Want your taste buds to get all trippy? Dipped those chips in ketchup.  It'll taste like you're eating pasta! 

My friend had the Redneck Burger which was also very good.  The battered peameal bacon alone was very good.  I would've eaten that on its own.  

My other friend ordered a regular poutine on the side and that was also very good.  It's all about the gravy and the choice of cheese and No Bull ain't bulls**ing you with cheese other than curds.  It's all about the gravy and curds, man!!  I personally can't stand it when poutine is made with other types of cheeses.  

Although we didn't have any but an added bonus was the fact that they serve Kawartha ice cream.  I can only imagine what their milk shakes taste like."}
{"text":"Best service and burger in town! Free parking close by. Love their spirit tight space but neat. Be sure to try their chips!"}
{"text":"Burgers were very good but the brisket on a bun was better. Good choice of milkshakes. Excellent and friendly service. Poutine was average."}
{"text":"Oh man.  I always eat too much here.  I can't resist the No Bull Burger sans double grilled cheese sandwiches filling in as buns.   But darn it's still a lot of food.  And the fries?? Hello.  Among the best in the city.  I don't need 'em but I always get 'em.  

Aw jeez.   I love the burgers here. 

And my wife swears by the quinoa burger.   It's pretty good.   Sometimes I get to finish hers too because she is so much more self restrained than I am.   

Just worth it.  Period.   

Mic drop."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS NOT WORTH EATING AT. Service was horrible, lady seemed pretty rude. I bought a double bacon cheeseburger and paid an extra dollar for an egg and it was way over cooked. My bf asked for the \"no bull burger\" and the cashier kept suggesting the regular burger. I don't know any business that would ask their clients to buy something they didn't ask for, let alone something cheaper. She was pretty adamant about my bf getting the regular burger as if we didnt know what we wanted. The egg on that was also overdone. The burgers tasted frozen. also they way they dress the burgers is pretty sloppy. No gloves and I didn't see anyone wash their hands between orders. The Greek restaurant was nice enough to let us eat In their restaurant tho :) our orders looked rushed and there wasn't really any line up. overall I suggest you spend your 8-11 bucks burger elsewhere. I would've been better off eating at a McDonald's."}
{"text":"It's right by the beaches. A little busy and hard to find parking, but totally worth it. The burger literally melts in your mouth. Had a lil burger but it was quit big. Definitely coming back by far the best burger joint for me"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly. The food is a touch on the pricy side but super delicious. As the saying goes \"you get what you pay for\"! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Rosie in Scarborough, Rosie want burger, Rosie find good reviews of this place on yelp, Rosie adventure over!! 

I was a touch skeptical at the state of emptiness of this place on a Saturday night, but don't let that fool ya, so many noms to be found. 

First, the French fries were like the most perfectest (and if perfectest wasnt a word, it is now) French fries I've ever had. Real potatoes, soft and warm on the inside, a nice gentle crispness to em but still a smooth firm outside. I feel like if I say anymore, it'll be borderline dirty talk, and I usually don't care about fries at burger joints but these were exceptionally awesome thus why I started my review here xD

The burger, arr, this is where it's at cap'n! Meat was definitely fresh, well seasoned, perfect texture, super yums, alongside crisp veggies that tasted real!! (as opposed to some places that you can taste the GMO-ness of their stuff) I had an option between Swiss or cheddar cheese *swoon* and my bacon wasn't crumbly or hidden like most other places, my mouth was pleasantly aware of it, the meltyness of the cheese and the awesome quality of meat. 

*melts into pile of saliva*...*reforms back into human as not to scare roommate who'll be unhappy to find i've melted on the floor...again* 

And they have chipotle mayo!! And whisky BBQ sauce!! These are definitely up there in my favorite sauces evarrr. 

Seatings pretty good, too. 

They have a t.v. and free wifi, and like seriously, who doesn't love free wifi?? 

And it's affordable, as opposed to the other equally awesome burger joints that make my wallet sad and sometimes, my tummy too. Left here not broke and full of yums. 'twas good stuff. 

Definitely would go back if I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"The burgers at this place are amazing. They are very tasty and filling as well. It also has a nice setting inside. The only problem is, it is a bit pricey ($7 for a burger) but with that quality, it is worth it."}
{"text":"The most AWESOME burger place in this area.  Affordable, good service... The burgers and poutine are just amazing. The beef brisket poutine YUMM. Very juicy burger. I'm not going anywhere else. They should open more branches across Toronto."}
{"text":"Always going back for their pulled pork poutine! Burgers are not so bad as well (go for the naked!). Best for take-outs but you can dine in next door (Souvlaki Express) since both places are under the same management."}
{"text":"I'm a real fan of the Kingston Road location, but the burgers at the Parliament location are shockingly dry and bland. What the heck happened? No even up to big chain burger joint standards."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Decent GF bun, fresh juicy patties that are well seasoned. Delicious milkshakes in lots of flavours made with real ice cream. Lots of topping options for on your burger and fun sides, mac 'n cheese bites, poutine, you name it. Great for takeout."}
{"text":"- meh.
- burger patty wasnt salted enough... 
- because some of the toppings are kept cold (tomatoes, lettuce, sauteed onions, etc)... the combination of cold toppings on a hot burger throws it off.
- wont be back.
- poutine was half decent. but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I dont normally post reviews but my fiancee and I were really mad about our experience here. I used to go to the original no bull on Parliament and loved it! It was general fare for a burger combo back then (around 13 bucks for bacon cheese with fries and drink) we decided to come to this location and were really disappointed. First of all a plain burgar starts at 9.50? 
Upon finally getting our burger the presentation looked great! However, that was where it ended. In general, the whole burger didnt have much flavour. Nor did the poutine. The only flavour I kept tastying was pickles even though there was no pickles to be found. All in all a really disappointing dinner than set us back almost 50$ which is twice the price of pretty much all the competiters. 2bacon cheese burgars with a large poutine and drinks for 50 bucks is outrageous for burger with no flavour other than pickles which were nowhere to be found on the burgar. Also, I hate pickles. Do yourself a favour and just go anywhere else but here. Its gone waaaay downhill."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday around noon and it wasn't too busy.

Pros:
- Tastes good
- Quality food
- Great service 

Cons:
- Very pricey for what's offered 
- Lack of parking"}
{"text":"Great organic, locally-sourced burgers with fav toppings like sauteed onions and mushrooms. Friendly servers, generally fast service. It's become our go-to spot for burgers!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. They're very nice and the place has a solid vibe. Milkshakes are great and the Quinoa Burger is a good veggie option. Be sure to try the redneck burger. It's excellent."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Tasty organic beef burgers. Gourmet signature ingredients like pulled pork, brisket, and real curds on their poutine. 

There are a great selection of toppings, and no up charge!

Finish off the meal with Kawartha Dairy Ice Cream."}
{"text":"4 Stars overall, but trust me, don't bother with a regular cheeseburger, NB's patty game is weak - it was entirely forgettable!

BUT I LOVED their REDNECK burger, the fries were great, onion rings very good, and the old-school hand dipped Banana milkshake was awesome!

NB's achille's heel is that the beef patty is sad - bland, overcooked and boring, HOWEVER, top it with a thick slice of beer-battered peameal bacon, lettuce, tomato, and BBQ sauce and we have a winner!!

If you know me, you know I love great low-brow food, including burgers. If you want simple beefy goodness, hit up Burger's Priest, Stockyards or Holy Chuck, if you want a char-broiled neighbourhood homeburger served by an old-school greek family, hit up Golden Star, Burger Shack or Real McCoy, but if you want a surprising, but great, novelty burger with solid fries and excellent Kawartha Dairy milkshake in a multitude of flavours, No Bull has your back!

Just a note for the naysayers - I normally hate novelty burgers, especially any burger with BBQ sauce, but this deep fried peameal thing caught me by surprise and had me wanting more! Don't hate, just try!"}
{"text":"Good food, the burger was tasty, well seasoned and fresh along with the toppings. very tasty. no complaints. 

Was it the best burger I ever had? no.. was it a tasty and satisfying burger? and was it worth the money? Definitely, yes. 

I also had the pulled pork and the poutine and I have to say the poutine was excellent!  fresh, fresh, fresh curds that actually squeak! 
Tasty gravy, fresh cut fries, it was really good. 

The pulled pork was also delicious, very smoky, (real smoke) along with a really good sweet BBQ sauce.

Their \"Bull Chips\" were  also EXCELLENT! homemade potato chips with Parmesan and spices were something I cold not stop eating, even after my dinner.  

I Think some may have expected too much based on their reviews, comparing them side by side to other shops and such, Which isn't that helpful. With all of them being in 2012, Maybe this place has stepped it up in the last year or so. 

Overall it's a good burger and BBQ joint with inexpensive yet tasty and quality food. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian burger options. Fresh, local, organic food.

As a vegetarian, it is really hard to find a great burger that is not cooked next to a beef patty. This place really delivers on flavor and gives me that authentic burger flare I miss with a healthier homemade quinoa burger (and no companion beef fat from the other orders). They even have a vegan poutine!  Did I mention that there are a ton of top-of-the-line burger toppings to choose from, most of which are free? 

And, I have to say, the cajun chips are delicious. 

2 veggie quinoa burgers + 1 vegan poutine to share = $18
I have no idea what you pay for a regular burger, but since most of my restaurant meals are at least $10, $9 isn't bad. Plus, you get the satisfaction of knowing you are supporting your local economy and reducing your carbon footprint. Not to mention, you're not eating overly processed mystery ingredients."}
{"text":"Spotted this place from across the street and was hoping for a hearty gourmet burger - the service is good - burger is decently priced if you don't combo it up. Paid $11 after adding drink and fries. Burger is okay - fries are okay ... Meh"}
{"text":"The service is exceptional here and the food is quite tasty. They have a wide range of toppings and it's all local organic beef. It's worth the extra cash to eat here."}
{"text":"These burgers are amazing! it has pretty limited seating, but the burgers are worth it.  Deffiently check it out!"}
{"text":"Went back recently and everything was a ok! 
poutine was way better and so was my burger!!!"}
{"text":"Trying to find a burger joint that offers a decent gluten free bun is still a challenge in most of Toronto, but thankfully there's No Bull Burgers to help out.
The burgers are really good - nice flavor, plenty of high quality toppings to choose from, and the food come reasonably fast with friendly service. There is a choice of cheeses, bacons, onions, sauces, etc. so you can really customize the flavor.
The gluten free buns are really good (I recommend getting a little extra toasting on them), probably the best I have had in Toronto.
The burger patties are 4 ounces each, so if you're hungry, you should consider doubling up to walk away happy.
The fries are okay, but really, I was just so happy to get a really good gluten free burger, I didn't care about anything else.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best burgers we've had in Toronto. Staff are really friendly, shakes (with Kawartha ice cream) are great too."}
{"text":"I was craving a classic burger done right and my craving was satisfied at No Bull! My girlfriend had one of their rotating specials...something with peameal bacon and BBQ sauce. The patties are very tender and tasty and proportionate with the burger as a whole. Onion rings were good but not outstanding. 

Friendly staff! Wait time was a little longer than I had expected. Fair price."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here now and still have the taste of the kid's meat burger in my mouths; they're terrible. I wasn't sure why my two nieces weren't eating them until I tried them. Adult burgers are okay, but the kid's are disgusting."}
{"text":"Came here on weekday afternoon with my family on two separate occasions. On my first visit I had the Redneck burger and fries, and on the second I had a pulled pork sandwich with fried mac and cheese and onion rings. Both of my orders were fantastic and flavourful. The burger patties are nice and juicy, and the portions are really big. 
My mom also does not eat beef and had the quinoa burger and really enjoyed it.
The store is a bit small, but it's nice and clean. They also serve really delicious ice cream there as well. I would definitely recommend the Redneck burger and fried mac and cheese to everyone.
All in all, No Bull is really worth the money, and y'all should go check it out if you're looking for a good burger."}
{"text":"Toula makes my burger like no one else. I love this place it's in an up and coming neighbourhood this is what this area needs more places like this. Great job!"}
{"text":"Super yummy amazing burgers, a big favourite with the whole family. Have gluten free options and do their best to make sure of no cross contamination - yay! Would be five stars but pretty pricey - we don't order from here too often because of that, tend to keep it as a very special treat."}
{"text":"We were craving burgers last night and so we went straight here! 
Delicious. Massive. Well made

I had the redneck with 1 beef patty and a breaded and deep fried piece of peameal bacon. Topped with whisky BBQ sauce. Yum!

My husband had the no bull burger. 2 patties, bacon, peameal and a fried egg! Protein heaven. 

No way we could eat this regularly or we would gain at least 400 lbs, but it was super tasty and we will go back again when the burger cravings hit. 

Their meat is organic and local. So, bonus!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a burger aficionado of sorts and I live within a 10 minute walk of two burger places, however given the choice between No Bull Burgers and The Burger Shoppe BQMBurgers.com (Queen West of Broadview) The Burger Shoppe wins hands down.

I made fast friends at No Bull with whom I presume was an owner and asked all sorts of questions about where they get their meat and apparently it's \"local\" (all the way from Quebec) and I asked since it's \"ground on site\" if their beef grind is a one animal process (meaning that there isn't a mix of animal in one patty) and it is not (the only place I know of for that is Allen's on the Danforth).  

The burger patties are 4 oz pre-cooked (quarter pound) and I ordered a double with peameal and swiss.

Burgers are cooked on a flat iron grill vs an open flame grill (i prefer a flame grill) and I could see that they shrank quite a bit and observed the grease on the grill while they cooked.  I also ordered fries, which are hand cut and are just OK.  My issue with the fries was that they were mostly small pieces and not sticks of potato, so if you like to dip your frites in ketchup or mayo you'll have to use a fork.

I ate 'in' and the burger was served on a tray with wax paper and the fries were dumped beside the burger on the paper - OK - whatever.  And that works however I like the wire basket (BQM Burgers) which I find more palatable vs eating off a tray.

The burger - Meh - I'm not jumping off my chair to tell everyone about No Bull, I will give them another try and try another iteration, but 2 stars is all I can muster. 

However I did hear from a non-meat eater there that their veggie burger;  blended herbs, quinoa and tofu (for binding) was excellent (except it's cooked on the same greasy grill as the beef?)."}
{"text":"For $6 flat I can get the best vegan burger in the city! Staff is always very friendly/professional and they are good to their regulars. Their fries are good, their milkshakes are good, and I can't stop going back :)"}
{"text":"The first thing that I noticed when I walked in the door was that the cashier smiled at me and welcomed me in.  Very good service.
I ordered a lil burger with cheddar bacon barbecue sauce and onions with a side of onion rings to go.
The fact that they had regular soda's and a premium brand was a nice touch.
Now anyone who knows me well will tell you that I'm a burger snob.
I have been looking forward to trying this place out.  I was very pleased by the massive amount of bacon on the burger and the cheddar was really cheddar.  Everything about the burger was great except one thing, the meat.  I don't know what it was, maybe the filler if any.  But the meat tasted different to me.  That's why I rated the place only 3 stars.
Everything else was exceptional.  I prefer my onion rings breaded.  These were battered.  But they were so good that they could convert me!
Now this is just an initial review.  I will go back to try the burger again just to confirm what I've tasted.  I also want to try their poutine to see how it stacks up against La Banquise in Montreal."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for lunch.  Like, 30 min. ago.

I like the simple menu and basic concept: pick your burger, pick your toppings, cooked and assembled right before your eyes.  There is nothing fancy here and I like the old bottles of pop.

But what about the actual burger?  I went with the basic quarter with cheddar.  It was perfectly A-OK but nothing incredibly special.  I like the shredded lettuce.  Maybe there was too much ketchup, mayo and mustard?  I noted that the patty had a larger diameter and was flatter.  The bun was fine.  Yeah, there was just nothing super amazing about it.  But for under $8 and a short walk from work, I'm totally happy with this independent, no BS burger place.  (Not everything has to be super special in life, right?)  

I'll be back to try it with mushrooms, bacon and swiss.  I also want to try the fries and/or chips."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I absolutely love it! My boyfriend introduced to this place because we both like to eat healthy, organic foods, and locally sourced foods I'm also vegetarian so they have an awesome quinoa burger that is too die for! I love that you don't have to worry about that added crap such as preservatives, fillers, hormones, or gmos in your food here. The serving of fries you get is also very generous so me and my boyfriend usually get one order of fries and separate burgers. 

It's a small place and a very chill atmosphere. Staff are friendly as well. The wait for your order is usually around 5 minutes or so (from my experience anyways). 

This is a must try for this who love to eat healthy and support their local economy at the same time! 

TIP: don't forget to check in! You can save 10% on your purchase to use that very day or you can save it for later."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. The organic Quinoa burger is amazing.  Buns were fresh. Chips were great. My date had the onion rings. 

Clean place. Staff were really nice. Very comfortable environment.  

 I would recommend this place to anybody and will definitely return here again."}
{"text":"The No Bull Burger  ... It's Massive 8\" Burger!!! Taste great... going back there again"}
{"text":"REALLY solid burger joint. 

I paid $19 for a double burger with blue cheese + 1 order of fries, and I can say I feel satisfied with that price after just having finished it all. The blue cheese was $3 extra,  and sautéed mushrooms/any other cheese and a few other fixings like bacon will tack up your end price a little more too. 

The service was very very friendly. 

There's a decent selection of fixings that don't cost extra.

The fries are heaping and delicious- better than burger's priest  fries. The burger itself is close to burger's priest, but I personally like the taste of the beef itself better at burger's priest. 

Will come back to try their No Bull burger, which comes between grilled cheese buns, and with peameal bacon."}
{"text":"No Bull Burgers I \"believe\" is owned by a Greek family who also manages the adjoined Souvlaki Express, which was too busy for a quick bite and resulted in us giving this burger joint a try over lunch.

The lady making up our burger was similar to the soup nazi but there seemed to be a lot of selection.

I passed on half my burger, I found it too greasy and too big for my liking and opted to  eat the fries, which must have changed since one of the reviewers here mentioned they were small. Instead these fries tasted like chip truck fries which is always delicious. Big and still crispy!

If I was desperate and couldn't drive my way to BQM, GBK or Burger Priest I'd maybe come back but to be honest the food from the Souvlaki Express looked better so I'd probably opt to eat that."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, when I saw the other reviews mentioning their request for 5 star review, I wasn't sure this place could live up to the hype.

Decided to give it a shot for lunch today - I was not disappointed.  

The burger was great - I had some second thoughts about the toppings, but it was still delicious (should have added bacon.  You should always add bacon.). The fries are enormous, could have done without them. 

I was shocked at how friendly the staff was - I'm not used to counter staff at burger joints being so genuinely nice.

If only they were licensed so you also get a nice local craft beer too."}
{"text":"Probably my least favorite burger joint in the city. It wasn't a bad burger just nothing special. The patties are pretty thin and taste closer to frozen burgers you'd BBQ at home. The poutine was also below average.

The price is decent but just expected more from a place which burgers are their main food.

There are tons of better burger joints downtown."}
{"text":"My first time, having a burger here and it was a total delight. My server was great at answer my questions and recommended good options. My burger with pea meal bacon and cheese loaded with everything, was so juicy and mouth watering good. Definitely returning again. No Bull here !"}
{"text":"So right when you walk into No Bull Burgers they have a little sign that says (and I'm paraphrasing): \"Our goal is to score five stars on every Yelp! and U****s**** review and if we don't, our goal is to make it better\" or something like that. While I really do appreciate them taking up that challenge (it shows moxie!), I'm afraid they for me at least, they're off by a couple. 

Now I don't usually venture into the East End but we have some friends there who just welcomed a baby girl and the one condition they set for visiting baby was that we bring food! Hey, who can blame them? They certainly don't have time to cook for us! So lazy me, not wanting to cook, is on the look out for a convenient take out option that accommodates the vegetarian (me) and the gluten & dairy intolerant (my wife). No Bull seemed to fit the bill and the owner was even good enough to reply to my concerns over the vegetarian gravy containing mushrooms (it doesn't) and whether or not there are any weird fillers in their burgers that may not agree with my wife (nope, no fillers). So we're off to a good start before we even walk in the door!

We get there and the place is smaller than I expected. Seating for only about 15-20 people or so but that's no worries considering I'm getting it to go. My wife orders hers with a gluten free bun...which they are out of. Awesome. So she's stuck getting a 'naked' burger on a bed of lettuce, which unless you're on a low-carb diet, is pretty depressing. Oh well, maybe the patty will be out of this world! Well, it wasn't. Flavour-wise it was just okay but the biggest problem she had was that the thing looked quite sickly...very thin and pale in fact, something that was only highlighted by having the thing bunless. Certainly not worth $5.50 for something that didn't look much better than a McDonald's patty. As for her fries they were...oh wait, they charged us for the fries and forgot to give them to us. So she had basically an unhealthy looking burger patty and nothing else. I normally check but we had a large order and were running late to get to our friends' place so I didn't inspect the order this time. Awesome.

As for mine, I went with their quinoa burger made up \"No Bull style\" (I think). It was much better than a burger made out of quinoa has any right to be but decidedly middle of the pack when judged against other veggie burgers I've had (and I've had plenty). I did enjoy the fixin's (BBQ sauce, sauteed onions, lettuce, tomato, spicy mayo and cheese) but $7.00? No, just no. Not even close. Their poutine, thankfully, was quite good and even a small at $5.50 is pretty substantial and they didn't scrimp on the cheese curds which is nice. Good fries and gravy and if the curd isn't the best, I could forgive that based on the generous amount they heaped on. 

So I'm giving them a pass but it's not the five stars that they aspired to and really not close. I started off with pretty high expectation but they really didn't come close to meeting them, sadly. It's a shame because it really does seem as though they're trying hard to do everything right. The service was very friendly, they make checking in on Yelp worth your while (do so before you order!), they (ostensibly) have options for people with all sorts of dietary restrictions and it just seems like a cool place all around. But it was too expensive for what you're getting and the fact that we had to stop at McDonald's for fries later because my wife was still hungry doesn't help their cause.

If I'm ever visiting my few friends in that area I feel like I want to give them another shot but I'm really not there that often and there are plenty of other neat places in the area that I'd be inclined to try before I go back to No Bull Burgers. Certainly not bad by any stretch but really quite a bit of a disappointment."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the best burger joints in Toronto right now. What mainly stood out was that the food was fresh and their service was very friendly.

I ordered \"The Redneck\" (two different cheeses, beer battered peameal bacon, burger patty, toppings, and BBQ sauce) with fries and tasted absolutely amazing. It was a bit pricey but definitely worth it especially to how massive the burger was."}
{"text":"Was in the area and craved burgers - looked up on Yelp and saw No Bull Burgers on the top of the list so we decided to check it out. We got the No Bull Burger. It was HUGE! I don't know if anyone can actually finish the No Bull Burger by themselves. It was like the size of my face. My boyfriend and I had to share it. Everything tasted very good together in the burger. I do wish the egg was not cooked entirely through as I like my eggyolk runny. I will be back to try the rest of the menu!:)"}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this place, I really did, I was looking forward to the new burger joint on Kingston road. I was expecting a big juicy burger, something the likes of burgers priest...  however what we got was a flat, thin, dry patty that must have been  previously frozen. There were lots of good choices for toppings in the burger. The onion rings were a but overcooked and dry and the pointine was just average. If I could I would gave it 2.5 stars because their customer service was great, they were very friendly,  nice and helpful. Please improve your burgers no bull! no more frozen dry flat patties or else you're 
just a more expensive McDonald's or Burger King... I want to like you I really do but you've got to improve your burger!!

Update.. Went back 
and tried the chicken burger and quinoa veggie burger and they were both delicious. I changed my rating to 3 stars for their great customer service and the other items."}
{"text":"Burger was good so 3 stars for that but They served poutine on burned thin fries will not recommend the poutine at all. Service was good and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Just had lunch, it was great. I'll be coming back. I had the redneck burger, tasted great. I noticed that the staff paid close attention to cleanliness which is great to see. They definitely care about the business."}
{"text":"Excellent burger, fantastic service. Nice place to sit and watch Breaking Bad on Netflix while enjoying the food. Ordered food to eat in and it was brought to my table with them also clearing the table."}
{"text":"Probably the best vegetarian burger I've ever had anywhere. No Bull's veggie burger has actual texture and a bit of crunch thanks to its quinoa base, unlike the soggy Gardenburger-esque patties many places seem to serve. Also love the big assortment of toppings you can choose from at no extra charge!

You can also get vegetarian poutine gravy, which is nice and tasty, and their milkshakes are fantastic."}
{"text":"I ordered in from here on just eat (in the middle of a snowstorm) &  the food was great I had the Montreal poutine and thought it was fabulous ! One of the best iv had in Toronto so far and a cheeseburger , it was delicious , I ate every last bite. And the service is outstanding ! I ordered three ice teas but only received two & to my surprise an hour or so later there was another knock on my door and the delivery guy was there with the ice tea apologizing as it fell out of the bag in his car.  I didn't have to call and complain he came back on his own accord and in the middle of a snow storm none the less. There was literally a foot of snow on the ground ! Very impressed to say the least"}
{"text":"Great burger and fries. Pleasant staff. I'll be going back. We were in a bit of a rush and looking for something filling and a place to sit-in, ever this place is local we'd never been in before. There were a number of patrons ahead of us but we had our order taken within a few minutes and the order was up shortly after."}
{"text":"It's up there on my \"favorite burger\" list. Organic, lean, scrumptious. Deets: 

The \"Joint\": 
Literally a joint restaurant - there's the burger place... and then the same owners own a Souvlaki place right next to it; connected by a door on the inside. There's no seating in the burger place (and it's actually quite small), but you can always carry your meal into the next room (the Souvlaki place). 

Menu: 
Tons of different burgers/toppings to choose from - ranging from $6 to $13. I took the simplest and the most inexpensive one - lean beef burger with my choice of toppings. Didn't enjoy the fact that I had to pay an extra $5 to upgrade to a drink and chips combo. That's to excessive, no?

Grub: 
Mmmm. Burger was amazing. I decided to top mini with tzaziki; was feeling experimental and it paid off. Tasted absolutely fabulous. However the handmade chips that No Bull serves beats anything I've ever tasted before. Thin, crispy, salted to perfection. Forget Lays, forget Tostitos... I'd pay for these chips if they ever sold in a store. Also, they have Coca Cola in vintage bottles. Cute.

Will be back soon. This is a nice find, tucked away in an unpopular corner - Parliament and Queen."}
{"text":"Disappointment. It promised to be so good, organic, locally sourced and all that, but turned out an overall unpleasant experience.

Delivery - 
20 minutes late plus I had to pay for the order regardless.

Food - 
Both burgers and fries were cold. I specifically asked for well-done patties, but they were medium (ew). So I had to microwave the burger. I could've just as well gotten a frozen burger from Sobeys nearby.

Summary - 
Never again."}
{"text":"Had the redneck burger, I like big burgers, and this was BIG, but unfortunatley I really didnt think the various flavours complimented eachother well at all, the textures threw me off as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall.  Friendly staff, clean if small seating area and a good menu.
Had a cheeseburger and fries.  Burger was fresh and moist without being messy.  Fries... meh. Price was good for what I received, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had the quinoa burger with blue cheese and a gingerale. It was really really good but it comes by itself and with the can of pop and the cheese it was $10. Love love love the burgers but maybe not necessarily the price."}
{"text":"Was sent a Tweet about No Bull Burgers by the Missus the other day so, as I had an hour or so before work, I gave No Bull a shot.
First perk of the neighbourhood, free street parking on Sundays! (and kudos to the parking authority for programming their metres to refuse payment on days where parking is free).
When you step in, you realize that it's connected to the (famous?) Souvlaki Express at the NE corner of Parliament & Queen. Spending much of my time in Greektown, I chose to go directly for the burger (with Swiss, served cold, unmelted). 
A fantastic greeting by the dude working there. Genuine, which I appreciate. In fact, he was amazing to everybody else walking in, as well as chatting to me about the 90's music selection they had playing. 
Ordered my burger ($7 tax-in) and grabbed a seat. There are only a few chairs, it's more of a take-out spot, but enough seating for maybe 8 people?
The burger: good, fresh, not greasy even when cooked on a flattop. The bun was fresh, ingredients added after the fact (a la Harvey's) and the taste was good. Not great, but good. I think I'm a grill guy. In fact, I KNOW I'm a grilled burger guy. Flattop cooking just doesn't do it for me. 
I will go back though on my poutine tour. And for service alone, I'd recommend anyone give No Bull a shot."}
{"text":"By far,  the best burger I've had in the corktown area.  Better than Hero, South Street and Big Smoke. 

For Under $6.00, you can get a decent,  organic burger. The patties look a bit thin,  but don't let that discourage you. Lots of toppings and friendly staff. I do wish they used a different bun like a ciabatta bun instead of a thick,  dry Dempsters bun. My boyfriend and I shared a small order of fries and still couldn't finish them. They give you a lot of fries. 

I'll be back once the weather gets warmer. If they had a patio or more seating near the window, it would be more awesome. Try this place!"}
{"text":"Their main burger is the bomb.  Having all that antibiotic-free beef is the right stuff if you want a healthy body.  Plus the service was good with a nice free parking location.  Only knock I guess is the price I think there should be more food lol"}
{"text":"Kudos for gluten free bun option and a very unique and tasty quinoa burger! Haven't seen one anywhere else. Don't baulk at the idea, give it a try, you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I had the bacon cheese burger combo, it was good, not the worst. The burger was the highlight, it was cooked properly, the bacon wasn't fatty. But the fries, oh the fries. First there was way to much, they tasted like they were cooked too long, maybe it was the oil, but the fries weren't my favourite. I would go back but next time I would try the onion rings."}
{"text":"Ok, so I originally thought this place was a vegan burger joint ... it is called \"No Bull\" after all and has this large front sign about \"organic\" outside. Then, I saw the reviews and the 10% off coupon and decided to give them a try. The burger was great. The beef has tons of taste. Fries are good. And the sink right by the seating to wash up. What an awesome idea. Owner: Beer (whiskey?). We are way too close to the Distillery District and Harbour for this place not to have beer (maybe put a sign up at the register to the place that sells this next door?). Cut the fries order in half and charge 2/3rds the current price. Maybe upgrade the Coke Machine for multi-source fountain selection."}
{"text":"Juicy! I would recommend the Swiss cheese burger.  Best burger I had for around $10. However, the store is pretty small, if you can't find any seat in store, feel free to seat next door at the Greek cuisine."}
{"text":"The thing that I liked is that burgers are from organic grass fed beef. But unfortunately they are a bit dry for my taste."}
{"text":"I Love everything about this place. The price for a premium burger cant be beat. This is a must try burger I guarantee you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Bit expensive but pretty decent burgers. Will definitely go again ESP now that I know about the 10% check in discount!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Amazing burgers, kettle chips are delish, and they seem to be always open when I need a big hunk of greasy (but organic!) meat between two sweet sweet pieces of nom nom bread... Dripping with condiments (like pineapple!!! At no extra charge?! Yes please!), it's the kind if burger that runs down your arm but you don't really care. 

Ok, gotta go get a burger now. See you in 10."}
{"text":"I might love Burgers Priest but there aren't any locations close by, and they don't have a gluten free bun option.

I had thought about trying No Bull burgers for a while, and so hubby and I gave it a try.

I appreciate that they use organic beef, and I really appreciate the gluten free bun, which at $1.25 extra was quite reasonable.  That gluten free bun was quite tasty, soft and lightly topped with poppy seeds.

I was especially impressed when they asked if gluten free was a preference or an allergy, clearly they would take extra steps to make the burger safe for those with celiac disease, where I just avoid wheat because it makes me bloat and gain 5 lbs in a day.

The burger itself was thinner than I like but the garlic flavour packed a punch.

The array of toppings was impressive and that mighty gluten free bun held it all.

The fries were a bit greasy but clearly house made but mostly tiny bits, and when I have fries I NEED to dip them in ketchup, it's a rule, and when most of the fries are undippable, I get a bit cranky.

I forgot to use my Yelp coupon at checkout, so I am glad I liked No Bull enough to return soon so I can use it.

PS - I put this as a tip but thought I should add it to my review \"If you order in advance by phone to take out, they will have your order ready to go but if you order a beverage, make sure they give it to you, they don't put it in the bag with the hot food, which is appreciated but we had to go back when we realized the Coke wasn't in the bag.\""}
{"text":"Bull king. One of the best burgers. 

More people need to try their burgers. They're in an inconvenient location compared to other popular burger places (ex. Priest, P&L, etc.) but it is well worth the trek. The place is known for their fresh, organic Ontario beef. 

I asked the owner which burger he recommended and he said one of the most popular and original burgers is the redneck burger. It has DEEP FRIED PEAMEAL on the burger, amongst other classic toppings. I was skeptical of course because I hadn't seen something like that before, but decided to go all out. 

The Burger took a while to make, but there is an area to sit. The restaurant itself is small and is attached to the place next door. 

When I finally got my burger, it was much larger than anticipated. It is a pretty heavy burger, so be prepared! The burger is one of the best I've had - and I have to say I attribute it to the whisky sauce. It ties the whole burger together beautifully. The deep fried peameal is nothing to scoff at; it is crunchy deliciousness adds another dimension to the otherwise splendid burger. 

I highly recommend this place to anybody looking for a great burger."}
{"text":"Surprisingly fast, despite being busy. I got the Quinoa burger--yes, at a very beefy place--and it was delicious."}
{"text":"No Bull Burgers is an establishment that prides itself on offering fresh, locally sourced, extra lean organic beef that is ground fresh daily with no additives. Conveniently located in the Upper Beach neighbourhood, it's a cool place to get a burger made to order. The seating is limited but quite comfortable given the size of the dining area.

Must-try items:
Big Burger
The No Bull Burger
Montreal Style Poutine

The service is polite and quick, and the ambience is right whether you're dining in or taking out. Casual vibes flow throughout the tiny space, with a view of busy Kingston Road through the facades to the north and east.

Burger satisfaction is the main attraction here, as a Big Burger (1/2 lb.) is guaranteed to leave you stuffed. Adding your own custom toppings is part of the fun. Specialty fixings can be added at an additional charge, and include options like fried egg, guacamole, and sour cream. Portion sizes are generous, so make sure to come on an empty stomach. Overall, this is a solid place to get a premium quality burger, no BS'ing."}
{"text":"Amazing food, incredibly friendly people, and where else can you get a quinoa burger!? Especially one with so many toppings!"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised to see that No Bull Burgers only has three stars. 

We stumbled across No Bull Burgers as we were on our way to a wedding, looking for a meal beforehand. My mom and little sister have Celiac's Disease, so we thought a burger place would be tough, but decided to check it out to see if it was possible to eat there. 

Turns out No Bull has gluten free buns - which was such a welcomed relief and treat for my mom and sister. Not only did they have GF buns, but they both said they were the best buns they'd ever had! It was such a nice thing to hear as we had been struggling on vacation to find gluten free options in Toronto. 

The guys working were so friendly, and the burgers were wonderful! If we are ever back in Toronto, I know we'll return. 

Thanks for an awesome experience, No Bull Burgers!"}
{"text":"The staff were very nice and the order prepared quickly. Though good the burger  wasn't anything special and if you make it a combo your bill will quickly rise."}
{"text":"All hail the Duchess!

After only two short visits for take-out from this place I became the Duchess. Duchess of No Bull. Not bad. Not bad at all. This fun title is a great example of why I love checking in on Yelp. 

I digress.

My dining companion and I ordered one combo and a bonus burger. With tip this came to $24. This is steep. I understand the ingredients are nicer than fast food, but in general, I'm not the hugest proponent of the 'gourmet burger' movement, I'm just a burger cheapskate. 

The burgers themselves were above-average, and they are very generous with the toppings. You point and choose your toppings at the end a la Subway, aside from cost-extras like bacon and cheese. We got ours to go and the buns, though soft, managed to not get soggy before consumption. For a fancy burger joint this is huge. Bravo. The fries themselves are nice chip-truck style fries. Delish. 

The inside of this place has very few places to sit and is connected directly to Souvlaki Express. 

PEPPER POINTS: For serving Coca Cola in the old glass bottles."}
