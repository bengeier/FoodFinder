{"text":"Jan's Meat & Deli is a pleasant Polish market with plenty of fresh meats, cold cuts, and speciality cheeses and breads available at their large deli counter. They also offer fresh perogies, sausage rolls and cakes, plus Polish newspapers and magazines, as well as a modest variety of imported products.  A veritable potpourri of Polish pleasures!  It's a great place to go if you want a little Poland on your plate or in your pantry."}
{"text":"If you want serious sausage and cured/smoked meats, go to Old Fashioned on Cleveland Crescent. If you want quality cuts of meat, go to Jans. His cuts of pork and beef are better than the equivalent at Bon-Ton. He's not the sausage maker, he's the butcher you need. His scratch perogies are good, as is his smoked mackerel. In a pinch grab your ham or bacon from him too. As with Old Fashioned, Jans has many other Polish things to buy. I use him for mineral water a lot. If you live in the hood this place needs to be as basic a stop as Sunnyside Market. As with Old Fashioned, closed Mondays... yum!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent Polish deli owned by a real butcher who makes all the meat products.  You can get ground beef and pork which they will grind from real meat when you order it.  There is also an assortment of Polish and other European imported products."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Helpful and friendly. It's a little treasure in the community.  The home made menu available is excellent, great variety of meats and European foods."}
{"text":"Established in 1987, Jan's Meats & Deli is a family owned and operated smokehouse that boasts some of the city's best smoked goods. I'm talkin' hot-smoked, sugar-cured wild salmon, European bacon, back bacon, ten types of smoked sausage, and an impressive array of pork rouladen stuffed with herbs and bacon or ground meats.  Jan's also carries fresh AA beef and pork, free-range chickens and lamb, free-range eggs, baking cheese, kefir, beets and horseradish, herring, bigos, cheeses, syrups, jams, kasha, breads, mustards and chocolate.  Great service, great selection and some of the freshest product our city has to offer."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  It reminds me of the kind of deli my mom brought me to as a kid.  The meat has no additives or preservatives.  They carry my favourite MC Dairy sour cream and cow candy fudge treats.    They sometimes get crazy busy on Saturdays with a long line up.  Unfortunately, they are closed on Mondays to give workers a full two day weekend."}
