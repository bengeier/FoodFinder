{"text":"In a world of cookie cutter businesses and coffee joints, there is a place that stands on its own. Fantastic coffee, wonderful people and, at the moment, complimentary shortbread cookies to toast the holiday season. If you're anywhere near Corktown, don't pass it by."}
{"text":"First off, I should say that my review is probably biased:  I've been going to Broadview Espresso (Sumach Espresso's older sibling) regularly for a couple of years.  With that in mind, SE hits all the same high notes (delicious drinks, friendly relaxed staff and inviting atmosphere) with the added bonus of resting inside a beautifully designed space and offering more robust food options.  I didn't have a chance to try a sandwich, but owner Mike Cullen has a passion for cooking and I wouldn't be surprised if they were great.  Not that most sandwiches require any cooking.    Try Sumach Espresso."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood coffee shop!  I come here all the time. The staff is friendly, the empanadas are terrific for breakfast, and the coffee is wonderful! It's a small place but cozy and in the summertime there's a patio to sit on. This is a great spot for grabbing a coffee on your neighbourhood stroll or for sitting with a friend or a book.  One time I came in after I bought my bike and ended up having a terrific chat with the owner who was there and a biking enthusiast.  The point is, if you live in the neighbourhood make it a part of your routine and support this great local spot!"}
{"text":"The 2 young men that appear to run the show are nicer than most snotty baristas at independent coffee shops. Coffee is perfect. Small variety of pastries. My muffin was flavourful but a bit too eggy. Nice, relatively quiet place to do a bit of work or to cruise on Tinder or Grindr.  Despite being on the edge of sketchy corktown you feel distant from the drugs and sex that are rampant in this area. Unless,of course, you've dropped a hit and are on Grindr/Tinder."}
{"text":"Love it, the Matcha Latte is great. Actually everything is great. I always stop here, it's very easy to enjoy a cup of coffee here. Very nice environment."}
{"text":"Great little neighbourhood location - cool vibe, good pastries.   Nice \"garage door\" for good weather.   They know what they're doing, coffee-wise, but I'm not a big fan of Rufino beans, which they use. I'd be happier if they used a smaller, city-based roaster, rather than this big (yet environmentally conscious) facility in Concord. They earn their 4th star for the vibe and complimentary dark chocolate treat that came with the coffee (think Aroma)."}
{"text":"Quaint coffee shop! Came here in the morning, loved the atmosphere. Quite a neighbourhood coffee shop as there was a small line up but it goes fast. Only problem I can foresee is working space - not too many tables available if you are planning to work.  I ordered a double shot Americano and a lemon cranberry muffin - $5.75 in total which isn't too bad (Americano was around $3.25). The coffee was good - not great, not terrible. Barista was great, asked if the water level was good and if I wanted it topped up.   Amazing service, good atmosphere, good coffee."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good seating options, a number of outlets if you need to get work done. I really like their grilled sandwiches (they have both breakfast and lunch options) and their drinks, too. I'm not a coffee drinker, but they make a delish chai latte and their peppermint hot chocolate actually tastes like mint, which is key to me! All in all, a very satisfying coffee shop experience."}
{"text":"Like we need another coffee shop... Too small for comfort but unique in a lot of ways and yet the same as others. When I go for a coffee I go for the coffee not that attitude and this place serves up plenty of attitude. I give it 3 stars because it is the best in the area but not the best around.  I take away two stars because I didn't find it very welcoming. Keep in mind I'm not a coffee shop type of guy. I'm not one to sit for hours in a coffee shop with my lap top open.  I will try it again simply because of the location and I hope for a better experience and will update appropriately."}
{"text":"Cute little addition to Corktown, kiddy corner to the new Regent Park skating rink.  Great coffee and friendly staff. Welcome to the hood!"}
{"text":"Great little spot that knows how to make very good coffee!  Staff is very personable too with none of the hipster barista attitude that you can sometimes come across in some of these new coffee shops."}
{"text":"I like the dark roast beans with the strong and pleasant aroma. The barista made me a great cappuccino with a perfect latte art, very delicate milk foam. I bought one pound beans and the price is pretty good. I will come back if I visit Queen St E or Corktown.  Ps: my friend ordered a matcha latte. It tastes surprisingly good, better than most of the Japanese desserts place."}
{"text":"Your standard hipster coffee shop with standard pricing- $3-4 lattes etc. The coffee tastes good. Some street parking available. Service with a smile. Got seating for about 10-12 people. Decor is good. Will be revisiting."}
{"text":"I suppose the growing influx of cultured yuppies moving into the condos of the New Regent Park are not content with Tim Hortons being the only coffee house on the block. From the makers of greasy porn shop-turned-Broadview Espresso, comes this new corner mart-turned-Sumach Espresso! Something a bit more to the likings of the young and hip, by which this cafe caters mostly to, something I realize quickly as I looked out the window and watch the people of the Old Regent Park pass by unassumingly, still in many ways worlds apart.  As for the consumables, it's alrighty. Quite unpretentious an atmosphere, despite whatever's been said in the previous paragraph. A mix of seating options including the front patio, but no comfy armchairs like over at Broadview Espresso. The big \"Sumach Espresso\" logo on the subway tiled wall seems to be a popular Instagram subject."}
{"text":"Neighbourhood has really changed..  Good to see those addition.  Nice exterior and interior. Coffee was strong and good.  Friendly, easy going. Extend the hours? Hopefully....??"}
{"text":"Never seen so much flies hanging out at a coffee shop before and eating food that will most likely ended up on your plates...what is most appalling is that it doesn't seem to bothers the staffs one bit! There are at least 10 flies eating your displayed sandwiches and chilling on the rims of your coffee cups! We walked out immediately and it still gives me goosebumps"}
{"text":"Love the friendly staff, the atmosphere and the carrot cake. The coffee is great too :)"}
{"text":"Small indie coffee shops like Sumach Espresso always be quite enjoyable.  A great neighbourhood cafe to hang out for a coffee and get some work done with free wifi. There are also numerous outlets so you will never be out of power.  Cappuccino ($3.50) was good. The piece of chocolate that came with it made me smile."}
