{"text":"Being from VA, where we take seafood particularly crabs, fish and shrimp VERY seriously, I've been hard pressed to find decent, if not good seafood here in Charlotte....until now. I've been here about 5 times or so, and hesitated to write a review. I wanted to make sure the food and service were consistent. Well, it definitely has been. The crab legs,  shrimp, crawfish, lobster and that SAUCE are absolutely delicious.  I cannot wait until they start selling blue crabs, which should be very soon. Kudos Seafood Connection, please don't change!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what this is, but when I was trying to look for seafood connection the location was difficult to find. Seafood connection is located at king of spicy restaurant. When I finally got inside they told me that the seafood was sold out. I don't know what type of business they're running, but obviously they don't know how to run a business. Explain to me why a restaurant would run out of food, I guess they don't measure they're portions well. I haven't tried they're food yet, because they only open certain days. The times that I've stopped by they're out of food.
Lol good luck people !"}
{"text":"Always on point with the seafood especially the fried shrimp and gator bites. My wife always gets the C-port platter and I get the fried shrimp and fish. This place is always where it's at. Ever the Carolina Panthers take time out their schedule to come out and eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant is terrible. I paid $18.00 for one piece of fish and shrimp. I didn't receive the corn and sausage that supposed to come with dinner. I waited in line for about 45 minutes standing. I recommend to call in your order to a real seafood restaurant and when you get there, food is ready and you can receive more than 1 piece fish for less the price for fish and shrimp combo.."}
{"text":"Fried shrimp is sooooo good. Always fresh and a very good price. Like all before mentioned, wait can be awhile and payment is via cash only. Worth the drive! And worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing...from the flavor to the texture everything was cooked to perfection literally!! Also my wait was not bad at all I may have waited 30 minutes"}
{"text":"Love everything!!!!!! If there is a wait...its worth it! I hope they do get their own location, I hope and pray its not too far away when they do but I would travel for this!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is fantastic yes you will have a wait but it's worth it. Don't go on your lunch hour you may be waiting for a while.The fastest time I got in an out was 35min. Go on a day when you have time to wait. Overall 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. I could eat the crab legs everyday. Being 6 months pregnant the wait is a bit much for me but it's always worth it!"}
{"text":"I got the combo c. It had crabs shrimp and crawfish I believe. Also came with corn and potatoes. Flavors consisted of garlic and blender consult in abundance. The bottom of tray had at least a half an inch of butter. It was a lot of food but I don't know if it was about $40 worth. I will try another dish again be prepared for a long wait."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of visiting SC when they were at the church on the west side and now operating out of King of Spicy. I have traveled up to 40 mins one way and waited up to an hour once for my food. It is absolutely worth it. I've never been disappointed and turned a lot of people on to them. I live out of state now but I  always make a stop for food when I'm in town."}
{"text":"They will always get 5 stars from me!! I am a frequent customer, having tried almost everything on the menu! The food is to die for....I don't know of any restaurants of any genre that has better food!"}
{"text":"Extremely sketchy set up, cash only, but oh sooooo goood. Make sure you have time on your hands because the wait can be awhile due to everything being made fresh."}
{"text":"I don't know what these people use to season up this food, besides butter  but my visit and pricing was well worth it. I got the crab and shrimp platter (25.00) it was very filling and delicious.  Wait time to go was 30 minutes,  but they were right on with proposed time.  I'm hoping they spread this out in NC. I heard one is coming to Raleigh,  I hope this is true,  as it will be closer to me"}
{"text":"The food is tasty, but the customer service is the absolute worst. The restaurant is situated inside ANOTHER restaurant which definitely gave me the side eye & the wait times are extremely long. I doubt if they have a working phone in the entire establishment therefore call in orders are prohibited which is very inconvenient. It would actually cut down on the wait time if call ins or online ordering was accepted. Not sure if I'll be returning."}
{"text":"This was the C Port entree. Came with 2 crab clusters, 2 split lobster tails, 10-14 shrimp, 4 pieces of corn, 2 seasoned boiled eggs, potatoes and sausage. OMG, it was sooooo good! Easily he best seafood I have had!

This place is completely no frills. No wait service and all orders are to go. But, there are tables and booths so you can eat in. The only thing is that you will probably have to wait a while. The line can get long so get there early. There is a bar but it was not open when we were there. The food here was so good that everything else was a minor inconvenience. 

Be sure to wear something you don't care much about if you order the steamed entrees. They come soaked in seasoned butter sauce and you don't want to miss that!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place! I've never had seafood like this anywhere. If you're a seafood lover, definitely check this place out...you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday after work, minimum wait, and even received a discount for it being my birthday! I tried the C Port for the 1st time. The food was excellent, took me 3 days to eat!"}
{"text":"This place lived up to the hype. Best seafood I've ever had in my life, hands down. I don't know what they use to make their \"special sauce\" but I crave it weekly. Some may complain about the atmosphere and styrofoam plates the food comes in, but I work for an up and coming local business myself so I respect the hustle. Can't wait to watch this business grow."}
{"text":"Excuse me while I pick my jaw up off the floor.

This is beyond \"mid-renovation\" this is your play-cousin trying to cater out of a closed down Alcoholics Anonymous meeting space.  

Beat up.  

Dirty.

Low lighting.

Taking orders from a fucking plastic card table like it's a garage sale.

No tables, a few folding chairs for the poor souls who are eating there.

For the price, I'd rather sit in a restaurant that is clean, ready to serve with cleanliness and aesthetics taken into consideration.

I'm shocked out of my mind that anyone would eat here.  This place is not ready to be open.  If you don't have cash to open a nice place, you can keep all the crab claws.  I'm not here for this, ever."}
{"text":"Delicious! Flavor is on point and the prices are reasonable for the incredibly large portions. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hmmmm what can I say....Smack...Delicious...Bomb...Awesome!!! One of the BEST seafood places I been to!!! I like the fact that you pay Before you dine. Our waitress was always checking on us and made sure we didn't need anything. The food was A1 and I mean A1. You get what you pay for and it's full of Love!!! Flavorful!!! Most definitely will be back!!!! And take one to go...p.s. if ya get there early ya don't have to wait long but, it's worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Food Isn't Worth it!
The wait is terribly long. Ordered Shrimp and Grits today and it took 1:45 mins. to receive my order and when I asked about it, the girl at the counter was very rude and didn't even check on my order.  I've been here several times thinking things would change, especially after the re-grand opening thinking the service would get better and it's gotten worse. In past visits, they would run out of fish, oysters, and other seafood items.  How ghetto is that for a seafood restaurant to run out of seafood especially on the weekend...really!!!  They have also implemented time limits on sitting at tables in the restaurant to eat your food to 1 hour and to add insult to injury now you have to order your food standing outside of the restaurant. This is before they will let you enter the restaurant.  I'm not eating at a food truck...\"Who does that?\".  What happens if it rains or during extremely? hot weather or even with the doors open and your selling seafood; what's the plan for keeping the flys out? This is the south!!! Black people we need to get it together with our businesses? and run them more professionally.  I travel all over this country supporting black-owned? businesses? and I can tell you without a doubt I will not be supporting this black business EVER again.  #notworth it #ImDone."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have frequented this \"restaurant\" MANY times. I have thoroughly enjoyed the food but after my last visit, will likely not return. For starters, they are only open on select days and is only advertised by social media. This past Friday they advertised that they would be open 12-8. My husband drives all the way from Fort Mill after work to discover a sign on the door that they are not open although they advertised that they would be. So I cut them some slack and saw that they would be open the next day. They advertised they would be open again this day from 12-8. I drive 25 minutes from the other side of town, arrive at 7:22 to be turned away by their security guard. I was told they don't take orders after 7:30. Not only was it before 7:30 it was before 8 as they advertised! Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how much I love Seafood Connection, the crab legs are always on point and that magic butter sauce seriously is heaven on earth. The new restaurant now has seating and they take credit cards as well so there's no excuses for you guys not to try them now!"}
{"text":"This place was worth the wait! 

I'd seen all the reviews and pretty much knew what to expect...there was going to be a long wait but the food would be worth it. 

I arrived on a Friday night around 6:30 and the line was pretty much out the door. If you're dining in you order your food, pay and then take a seat. They also offer take out, you're still going to have to wait but you can enjoy all the goodness at home. 

I ordered the Lock Jaw which comes with shrimp and lobster, potatoes, corn and a sausage. It's a lot food. I appreciate that they cook up all the orders fresh. When my food arrived it was hot and well seasoned. I loved the butter and flavor. Especially on the corn, potatoes and lobster. Yes, it's messy. But isn't that the point?! 

Overall, it was a fantastic meal. I'd absolutely come back and try more items on the menu! 

Don't let the wait...make you miss this local gem."}
{"text":"Giving one star because I came to try this place out that everyone's been raving about and didn't have any luck bc I had to wait outside with a baby ..... like they have to get a better system working with the dine in and take out. There is one line for both. Not pleased but I hope to try the food one day. I'll give them one more shot but it's not the easiest with a baby. Oh there is no phone number so i couldn't call in if I wanted to."}
{"text":"Always pleased with the flounder, shrimp or oysters. Friends have gotten the crab legs & lobster tail and loved it. French fries are ok. Hush puppies - well let's just say that Cookout has better hush puppies! Be prepared for a wait most times. Little pricey but good portions."}
{"text":"Finally went to Seafood Connection. On Father's Day. Not the smartest move on my part, but they were more than prepared. I had a short wait (worth it!) to place my to-go order, but the staff & service were impeccable. We tried the crab legs & shrimp that came with sausage, corn and potatoes. Everything was delicious and worth both the wait and the money. This place will be in regular rotation for sure! Definitely did not disappoint!!! 5 stars, no question."}
{"text":"First time Visiting...We get here soon as they open on Sunday 11am. We walked over to the Hostess she takes your order & you pay. We ordered Shrimp combo & Shrimp tacos an item on the Sunday special You're given a number sign to leave on the table you choose to sit at. Our food arrived in a timely manner. Hostess & Waitress was very nice. The food was delicious. I'll come back to order the grilled or steamed platters. The music was a little loud in the restaurant. While placing our order the hostess had to walkie~talkie them in the back to lower it down...so she could hear her customers. But a great experience over all. For dine in Everything is packed in to go boxes brought to you,styrofoam cups. Condiments on the table are single packets of sauces, plastic packaging of utensils, wet wipes for your hands. And I get it all easy clean up no dishwashing!"}
{"text":"The hype around this place can be understood. But I felt a bit short changed in the sense of the food being a bit of a let down. Presentation 
Special Sauce
Lobster tail  best part of my dish
Shrimp - biggest let down had no flavor once opened and tasted under cooked, therefore I did not eat them. 
Corn 
Potatoes 
Crabrice- Hell Yes!! Just do it! 

I would return, because I believe in giving places 2nd chances. But was not overly impressed."}
{"text":"Hooah; originally was planning to dine at an Asian restaurant, however; they were closed Easter Sunday. I looked at my YELP APP, check Seafood & discovered Seafood Connection had 4 Stars ( underrated, should be 5+). Great photo of meals, wife saw Giant Crabs Legs; Shrimp, Corn ) served but not shown was sausage & potatoes) and said let's go there. This is my first time EVER writing a Review, that enough should tell you This place, the food, the service & price were all worthy of the highest compliments one could think of. My wife was even making sounds I've never heard before. I must tell all ; go check this place out. It's worth the trip, also it was my wife birthday and we went after the Hornets game. My wife said next time we go to a Panthers game we will stop bye also. My compliments to Seafood Connection & it's employees ."}
{"text":"Nom, nom and more nom. Seafood is amazing. Several in my group didn't want the abundance of butter and seasoning so I Google searched re-steaming crab legs, shrimp, etc. I brought a large pot of with 1\" of water with rack to a boil (make foil balls if don't have a rack for the pot you have) and placed crab legs, shrimp and corn on the rack but above the water for 3-5 minutes (do not place items in boiling water -- must be placed above water for steaming). The excess butter and seasoning melted off and was then buttered and seasoned perfectly. I dream of this place. What a find."}
{"text":"Please read entire review...I believe in redemption!

I'm sitting here now waiting for a Super Combo. It's been almost an hour since I ordered so why not start on the review...I have nothing else to do.

I'm not sure why things are taking FOREVER and I've seen people who ordered after I did get their food and leave. Hmmmmm, I wonder what they ordered.

As others have stated, it's cash only. And did I mention, it's taking FOREVER to get my food? I'm praying it's knocking my socks off, and blowing up my skirt good because it's honestly the only way I'll drive all the way back over here again, EVER!

The woman at the register is very nice.

I'm done for now until my food comes out. I ordered my food at 7pm, it is now 7:59...received food at 8:18.

PLOT TWIST...

The food is amazing! It's almost 10:00 and I'm just able to get to it because I went to the gym to earn the meal!

Everything is seasoned extremely well. The usual drawn butter one would need for crab legs has no place with this food, it really is THAT GOOD! And when I opened the containers, there was a little extra for my wait...I'M NOT MAD!

So although I walked out thinking that I'll probably never return, I have had a change of heart. I'm hoping my situation was a one time thing and the next time I'll be happy with my total experience."}
{"text":"Really good but not good enough to stand in some of the long ass lines that they have sometimes. It's like they have a cult following you have to follow them on Instagram or Facebook to know when their cooking. I get txt msgs when their cooking, don't ask me how I got on their list but that's how I know when their cooking. This was my first time here and I just ordered something simple thinking it wouldn't be a long wait but boy was I wrong. All I got was a fried fish platter with fries and it was still an hour from the time I walked in the door till when I walked out with my food. I was pissed about the wait but the food was good. I would go back again but I'm not waiting in that long ass line when I know other seafood places where the food is just as good and a little bit cheaper plus they offer better options like turkey sausage. This is not a knock on them but I'm just comparing."}
{"text":"Food is great. Giving this place two stars for the service. You order everything && pay BEFORE being seated. Then you get to your table, a waitress comes over and gets the drinks for you. After that, you wait for your food. There was four of us in our party. My husbands food didn't come until after everyone else was FINISHED eating. No one could track down his order. Your waitress doesn't even really know what you ordered. There was no apology made, no offer to get the manager. The only excuse they could give was that there is a fried side and a steamed side of the kitchen. Yet, no one had any fried seafood at our table so it still should've came out at the same time. 
The bathrooms were disgusting. Two of the three stalls didn't even have toilet paper. And as you walk your shoes make noise because the floor is sticky. 
It's sad to have such great food presented in such a way. And since you pay first, they don't care and it shows.
It's clear that they try to keep the overhead sooo low that they are actually losing business. A roll of paper towels on each table, pre packaged plastic silverware, food served in styrofoam and drinks in styrofoam cups sooo basically they don't have to wash or use any real dishes. And you'll never get a drink refill because you will never see your waitress again. They don't even have wet naps but everything is soaked in butter. Ridiculous. They're so focused on getting everyone to pay first but not focused at all on the experience. I'm sure the wait staff doesn't make anything in tips."}
{"text":"I have tried Seafood Connection twice and picked up food for others a couple of times. Located inside another restaurant King of Spicy whose food is horrible but I digress. Why share a kitchen in such a horrible restaurant? It seems so dirty. With so much hype, I still decided to go for it. I ordered the fish and crab rice. It was just Ok. The second time, I ordered salmon... just Ok. I didn't even finish it. The food is overpriced if you ask me and they use a LOT salt, and spread not real butter. Customer service is lacking. The girl took my order and once I paid I decided to just go with the combo and she told me it was too late my order was sent to the kitchen already. It had been a split second, nobody else in line, she could have gone out of the way if she wanted to. For these reasons I most likely won't eat there again. But just so the business knows, I have referred about 5 people that eat there regularly and I wish them luck."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great seafood however, the shrimp taste different (maybe because they are so large). I also, noticed some of my shrimp weren't cleaned good. The butter sauce is good. I just hate that they don't answer the phones when trying to place an order to go and they are only open on weekends! Overall, good seafood!"}
{"text":"THIS BY FAR IS THE BEST SEAFOOD IVE EATEN!! The flavor is so intense  without losing the essence of the crab! I'm so excited to know that I have a new spot for the seafood I've been craving! FIVE STARS aren't enough for this place! The portions are
Plentiful and the wait was extremely short seeing as how everything is made to order... I went in during my lunch break at work and made it back in time enough to enjoy this tasty entree... Keep serving up the deliciousness folks!"}
{"text":"New to Charlotte so trying different restaurants.   We thought we'd try seafood.  This place was up the street so we thought we'd check it out.   Crab legs were good.  Fried shrimp was pretty dried out and tasted like breaded chicken, probably due to the thick coating of cornmeal/batter & having to cook it too long??   Fried fish barely had fish..mostly cornmeal/batter.  They did bring me a grilled piece which was much better.  A lot of spices/herbs but it was ok.  Fries seasoned way too much & weren't fresh.  Hush puppies were just ok.  For a $40 meal we were faaaar from impressed.  Once served we had to waived down anyone we could find for drink refills. With the loud music (which was actually good selection) I felt like I was out clubbing.  Watch for the slippery painted floor...don't wear heels, you'll leave with a broken ankle!  I won't be back.  Not impressed. Gets a 2 only because crab legs & tea were good."}
{"text":"A little pricey but they give you so much for the price and their garlic butter is so delicious. They use quality ingredients, their crab legs had so much meat and were worth the price. They are super friendly and quick as well. Only open Fri-Sun 12-8pm and cash only. There is an ATM inside though! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a seafood fix!"}
{"text":"Found this place on instagram and I will travel for food. This was worth the travel time. Excellent food, quality of food, quantity of food and atmosphere. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is far and away one of the the best, most unique seafood set-ups I've ever seen or tasted.  If you haven't been or heard about Seafood Connection yet, lucky-for-you I went here, and am perfectly stuffed to give you everything you need to know from the Seafood to the Connection...

Parking:  Parking shouldn't be an issue, as Seafood Connection (SC) is actually housed in the same restaurant as King of Spice (I know it's weird), which is in a nice size shopping plaza off of Albemarle road.  

Follow:  In order to figure out exactly whats going on, when there're open and what the menu offerings are, you've got to follow their Instagram page - seafoodconnectioncharlotte

Set-up/Ambiance:  DO NOT GO HERE EXPECTING TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A WAITER COME TAKE YOUR ORDER.  This is not that kind of establishment. The best way to describe this place is to imagine the Soup-Nazis episode from Seinfeld, but for seafood.  For example, after checking their IG page and seeing they were opening at 2pm, I made sure to arrive at 12:40.  Yes, thats right, a 1hr and 20min before they actually started taking orders.  Trust me, thats the only way to go.  Upon arriving, you walk around to the bar area where they have plenty of seats, post-up, maybe grab a beer and watch the line grow until they start taking orders around 2pm.  Oh and once its ordering time, know exactly what you want, and have your CASH IN HAND.  That's right, cash only!!!!!  There's also an ATM located in the front lobby of King of Spice.   

Food:  I mean its seafood, and some of the best seafood you are gonna find in and around the Charlotte area.  I got the C-port plater (crab legs, shrimp, and lobster tails - all steamed), with a side of fries.  Total cost - $43.30.  Certainly not cheap by any means, but of course you have to pay for fresh, quality, seafood, especially here in Charlotte, NC.  In addition to the crab-legs, shrimp and lobster, the C-port plater comes with 2 small ears of corn, a big, meaty, smoked sausage (thats what SHE said, hehe), and one whole white potato, all drenched in some secret, butter, seafood sauce!!!  So you are are definitely getting a bunch of food.  I really can't complain about any of the food items.  Everything tasted awesome!!!  Everything is made to order, therefore it takes a good 10-15min before your food comes out.

Service:  No complaints as far as the service is concerned.  There's really not a whole lot for the servers to do except take your order, and bring you a styrofoam tray bursting with fresh seafood.

If you like seafood, you are gonna LOVE Seafood Connection.  Just remember to bring plenty of cash and look for King of Spice (once again Seafood Connection is located at the bar of King of Spice, don't say I didn't try to tell you!)  My only regret, is that I am just now discovering Seafood Connection, I'll be back soon and I'll be doing unmentionable things to some seafood!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Seafood Connection since they were serving at the church, but this was my first time visiting since they fully took over the restaurant, mainly because I live so far away and their hours are tough to fit into my schedule. I've always enjoyed the food, but this time my friend and I agreed that it tasted a little different. Not sure if it's due to preparing in much larger quantities. Still, we enjoyed everything, with the exception of another friend that wasn't very much a fan of the fried fish. The wait wasn't as long as I've experienced in the past, which was a plus. Overall, we were pretty pleased and will visit again sometime."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Seafood Connection since they had the food truck and at that time the wait times were brutal.  I arrived 10 minutes before they opened to a line of about 10 people already forming.  They opened the doors a little after 11 and only let a few people in at a time to order to eat in or takeout, they do not take calls so you will need to stand in line or come in to place your takeout order so I would advise to view the menu and know what you want in advance, however if you're going for brunch the grilled plates won't be available until after 3pm(at least that's what I was told).  I ordered the shrimp and grits and added crabcakes and a waffle to go, and by noon I was walking out with my order(I also requested light seasoning).  The shrimp and grits included some type of sausage and I would say overall it was amazing after I removed the sausage which didn't enhance the dish at all but took away from it with the weird taste of the sausage.  The grits were not instant but creamy and dreamy the way grits should be and adding the crab cake really sent this dish to over the top deliciousness.  The red velvet waffle with cream cheese was equally great and not average size waffle but a huge Belgian waffle..........have your pillow ready.  On a different day I returned later in the evening and a few things were already sold out....bummer(get there early).  On my third visit I had the grilled fish with sautéed veggies over crab rice, amazing from start to finish.  Everything was very tasty overall, minus the weird sausage, but be very clear there is still a wait, and it's very pricey, so if you're cool with that give them a try."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food from Seafood Connection. It was hot and fresh. I got the C-Port platter and there was so much food my husband and I shared it. The sauce was amazing! I will probably ask for light sauce next time I go because it was a little much for me but I wanted the full experience the first time I went. The best parts of my platter were the corn, potatoes, shrimp and lobster. I was not a fan of the crab legs, but I don't tend to like crab legs anyways (too much work!).

I don't understand people complaining about the wait. The wait is no different than eating at Red Lobster or Olive Garden and their food is prepared to order.

Love this place and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great food and HUGE portions. Nice staff. Music is too loud and it's too dark in dining room. With food this good I only wish they made homemade tartar sauce."}
{"text":"I've been in Charlotte for a year now, and this place has been the talk of my coworkers. I took off work early to go there, since I'm not off on the weekends and we expected a wait due to what we've heard. The wait in line to order & pay wasn't bad for us at all. We received our food in a reasonable amount of time, I ordered the shrimp & crab combo and my friend ordered the C port platter. I opened my shrimp and crab combo to find it was missing the crab cluster lol, no worries I just let my server know and they brought out in about 20 mins, which was fine because I understood they were busy. We didn't get our bucket for the shells or bibs, but the food was SO good. They give you a lot, but that sauce is delicious and the food was fresh and hot!! The roll of paper towels on the table really did come in handy. I read a lot of people stating this place is pricey, but seafood, GOOD seafood is never cheap and I'd definitely go back and pay for this again!! The sweet tea was also perfect!!"}
{"text":"The absolute BEST crab legs and shrimp I have ever had!! The corn was super sweet and the garlic butter sauce they make is unreal! I could put that on everything! The potatoes could be better and the sausage was so so. Next time I'll get all corn and seafood. Definitely worth the wait (I waited very long and was very annoyed by that. I think they forgot to put my order in) and I will be back! My container was so full it couldn't even close. My kinda portions"}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you don't mind standing in a long line! However, it is well worth it. Relatively inexpensive, quick service. Had an awesome waitress!! Would def recommend and return."}
{"text":"Seafood is everything.  I have mastered not waiting forever for food...buttttt even if you have to wait, trust me its worth it.  I have buying food from them since they were pulling up on sunset slanging plates in parking lot.  Def worth the money.  Unique flavor only the connect can offer you .  If you are in charlotte or visiting... make sure you check them out"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the hype and wait!! The butter sauce is so flavorful and the seafood was huge. Yum!"}
{"text":"Food 2 out of 5 based on the level of butter and potential heart attack that could soon follow"}
{"text":"The best in town I love this seafood place not to far from where I live the food is off the hook.Love my Crab Legs yummy"}
{"text":"I must admit that besides the friendly staff I was largely disappointed in my dining experience. One would expect food to come out hot, not barely warm. Rice was undercooked, it shouldn't be crunchy. Also I think the 1 hr dining limitations are absurd especially when the food isn't all brought out at the same time. Also today a friend I was dining with, they forgot something off her order, instead of just bringing it to her, they asked for her receipt to ensure she paid for it (insert eye roll). I wasn't a fan of the concept either of having to wait in a long line, then having to pay for my food, before I can even sit down. The flavor is there but work on making sure the food is served hot, this place is way too pricey to be served warm food, ensure tickets before they are brought out are properly filled instead of questioning patrons about the validity of an order issue."}
{"text":"Please implement a better system for entering the restaurant and placing a takeout order. Are y'all going to have ppl stand out in the cold to get inside when it's not even packed in here? Other than that, the food is great!"}
{"text":"I use to say I don't eat Seafood . Now I say I only eat Seafood Connection of Charlotte seafood. There's no words to describe it and all I can say is go try it for yourself but be ready to form an addiction! Make sure you order extra corn cause your gonna crave more!"}
{"text":"OMG! I always seen my peeps talk about it on FB n I'm like yea whatever but being the images made me wanna check it out. So I decided last Thursday to see whats the big deal...BRUH! it was so crowded in there I'm like the hype is real! Than I placed our order. Best I ever had seafood wise in Charlotte NC! Hands Down!"}
{"text":"This seafood is worth the wait. I waited about 20 minutes to place my to go order and about another 20 minutes for my food, but I would've waited longer. I had the connect platter. The crab legs and lobster tail were amazing.  The butter and seasoning was the best I have ever had on seafood."}
{"text":"Went here during my visit to Charlotte. It mid afternoon on a week day and the line was out the door. 

We were taking our food to go. 25 minutes later we get to the cashier to place our order. I realized why the line was so long, other than the food being delicious. No matter if you dine in or take out Everyone must pay first. No dine and dash here. Didn't take long to receive our food once ordered. 

I ordered the shrimp/crableg platter!!! Yesss, the buttery goodness was more than i expected and able to eat. You get crab, shrimp, corn on the cob sausage and red potatoes. I was so full, i had to save the rest for dinner the next day. 

I will be visiting again!! Hopefully, they'll have worked out the payment system by then."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time visiting; I was very excited to try food from the menu. My family enjoyed their meal. Some how they lost or accidentally skipped my order. After watching 9 people who order after me obtain their meal, I brought it to their attention. I had to watch 10 more people (19 people in all) get their food before me and wait an additional 30 minutes. I am a very patience person and I understand that things happen but customer service is vital to me; no one acknowledge the mistake or apologize. Believe it or not \"My bad\" or \"thank you for your patience\" , goes a long way."}
{"text":"Visit Date: 3/10/2018

First time here after all the Hype around Charlotte about this place 

FOOD & SERVICES: I had the C-Port Platter for $40 with extra butter sauce. IT WAS REALLY GOOD!! OMG WAS IT GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I was gonna eat it the restaurant. It was a very long wait for my food which I understand. BUT when I got my food, parts of my crabs was cold and the shrimp was mins away from also being cold, I don't mind waiting for my food because I know it's freshly cooked BUT WHEN MY FOOD COMES AND ITS NOT HOT AND I HAVE WAITED 30 MINS PLUS FOR MY FOOD THATS A PROBLEM. Mind you at that time I was going to dine in. The waitress took my food back to warm it back up and I asked her to just bag it up to go. The service to the table is a bit slow. I don't think each service have certain tables because about 2 to 3 different PPL stop it my table and asked have someone helped(which is a good thing). Now would I go back ......YES I WILL HANDS DOWN! I HAVE ALREADY PLANNED THE DATE LOL. Hopefully things will be better. Everyone have off days. 


INSIDE: it's pretty big and they have their logo on all the tables. It's a pretty good vibe. They have a good music playing. Yes the lines are long. When I got there it was just like 5 people ahead of me BUT when I was leaving (around 3:30 ish) that line was OUT THE DOOR! They also have a stage. I wonder if they have ppl preforming there sometimes? 

THE PROCESS: You pay for your food at front when you walked in (thats why the line is long like that). It would be helpful if it's your first time, to look at the menu before getting there, so it will help the line move faster. After you pay, the host will take you to your table. Then you will get your food. Now the food is cooked when your order. So keep in mind that it's not fast food. If you are in a rush you might want to call in your order and get it to go. They will bring your food in a Togo box (yes even if you dine in). Which is cool especially if you don't eat all your food. 

TOGO ORDER: YES YOU STILL HAVE TO STAND IN THAT LINE. BUT YOU WILL GO TO THE BAR TO PICKUP YOUR ORDER."}
{"text":"The seafood can get to be a tad salty but overall everything you want when you order fresh seafood! The wait is extremely long. Every time. My food (in my opinion) always suffers because of it && they took my favorite item (stuffed crab shells) OFF the menu. Hopefully it'll be better when they have their own location!!"}
{"text":"The seafood salad is the best. Haven't been in a while Cuz the line is always long. Great for business but I'm too impatient"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best seafood in Charlotte this is the spot!  First time and certainly not my last ! The wait wasn't long at I got the super c port ! This is best seafood I had in Charlotte period ! I  They also have Crab rice which I'm definitely going to try next! GREAT MENU *Update* Came back to try the fried shrimp and It was the bomb! **"}
{"text":"The crab here is everything. Really good and I know good seafood living in South Florida for 30 years. Best seafood in Charlotte by far I've been looking for a good place and I found it,  just bring your patience with you the line is longggggg. And if you don't get there early you might be out of luck because they do sometimes sell out early."}
{"text":"Saw the other postings and had to wait two weeks to catch them open but definitely worth the wait!   Completely fresh, enormous portions and can't wait to try other offerings!   Even with the long line waiting to order, staff was super sweet and friendly.   You know it's good food when they have to have a security guard posted to man the door and turn folks away when they have sold out for the day!  Keep up the great work and we will be back!"}
{"text":"So I am a fan from the parking lot days pull up pull up pull up!  My usual is the shrimp plate.  It's delicious and solidly two meals for me.  It's corn, potatoes (hello carbs) and 10 or so peel and eat shrimp along with beef sausage and a boiled egg.  The flavor and freshness is on point - yes it can be greasy but note you can ask them to go easy on spices and/or butter.  But why??  I budget this meal into my new healthy lifestyle.  Prices are fair and I've never had issue with customer service.  

My first visit to the new location in King of Spicy was Easter (Yes they were open Easter!).  I get the bouncer for security but it was still off putting.  There must be  a lot of cash floating around as it's an all cash venture at this point.  The snow crab clusters are also the bomb.  I'm so happy to see this place thriving.  I've noticed a definite uptick in professionalism too since the addition of Yeshika and Von Juan,  Both of these folks manage the social media and are always engaging - taking the good and the bad.

Only reason I didn't give five stars is my ONE beef.  I'd pay more for deviened shrimp.  I budget for the calories, but still have issue getting over the lack of deviening.  That being said the shrimp last time was perfectly cooked and not mealy.  Just i don't wanna eat shrimp poop.  Sorry to be gross."}
{"text":"This review is customer service based only. This is not based on the food or quality of food. 

Dear Seafood Connection Owners,

After learning of your restaurant and looking at a lot of reviews on Facebook, I decided to give your small business a try. Upon arrival, I noticed the parking lot had remnants of seafood thrown around. Specially, shrimp shells. As my husband and I proceed to enter the building, we were stopped by a gentleman sitting on top of the small brick wall. The gentleman asks us \"do you have a ticket?\"  We respond \"no\" and tell him we are just here to order food. The gentleman then advises that \"the restaurant owners\" are closed down for the night. I check my watch and notice there is still 45 minutes or so. As this conversation takes place, I am also noticing the gentleman is wearing a bulletproof vest.  Yes, a bulletproof vest, so I ask if he is a cop to which he responds \"no, just security\". My husband and I look in puzzlement, as we are thing \" but this is a seafood restaurant\"  what could warrant such protection, so we ask why are he's wearing a vest. The gentleman then explains you never know.  Hmmmm. We thank him and turn around to leave. I write this because it needs to be said. I have no intention of slamming the business to ruins. 

WE MUST LEARN HOW TO DO BUSINESS!  One should never conduct their business in such a fashion that the environment is conducive for hostile behavior that ultimately requires military style management. I'm sorry, but no restaurant should have security in a vest. Surely you cannot expect me to eat here, as it is hazardous to my safety.  If this is required, you should rethink how you do the business that you do. This is a restaurant and not a night club. DO BETTER!!!

Furthermore, the cleanliness of your portion of the parking lot must be checked. It's just not a good look for business. I step out of my car to shrimp shells thrown in the parking lot. It's your business, so you cannot use the excuse of we are not responsible for the parking lot because this is a reflection on you. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!  

Also, this business of creating an artificial inflation in the demand for your product by constraining business hours, product availability, payments accepted or otherwise will eventually cost you.  IMPROVE THIS!!!

In conclusion, I truly hope you consider what I have written and take measures to improve your business. Remember...small businesses are the heartbeat of America.  If this is your contribution to that heartbeat, one cannot expect anything more than confusion, blight and ultimate failure.  

Have a great day."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great vibe! Visited after church today. The server was pleasant and from what I tasted from my boyfriend's plate (came out in 25 minutes post-order), they have great chefs in the back. 
There is room for improvement. I don't believe an hour and 20 minute wait time for my order to arrive at the table is acceptable at any restaurant. 
When I asked about my order (at 40 minutes post-order, and 1 hour post-order), no one could give me any explanation as to why there was such a delay for 10 shrimp and a cluster of crab. 
I would like to come back, but I will be more persistent with staff to get my order in a more timely manner. 
Recap:
Great taste, nice staff, very long wait for food."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for a few hours and wanted to try some good food. Specifically good seafood. Someone suggested seafood connection and the pics looked so tempting i delayed my stay about 30 mins. The front door was locked but luckily, i saw a couple walk towards a side entrance and i followed. There is a sign stating they're under construction...not sure what the place was like before construction but i knew the food was going to be LIT as soon as I walked it. 
You get in line to place your order, you're given a number then you sit and wait for your number to be called. I didn't wait too long(15 mins) before my number was called. I ordered the Steamed Crablegs Plate($30) and there was a thick ass layer of butter on everything i had a heart attack but who cares. 
There is no place to sit and eat so it's all to go. I asked for wet wipes but they didn't have any and my container was so full, it wouldn't close so i knew I needed a lot of room(vehicle not sufficient) to spread and eat. 

I drove back home to GA to eat. Quickly reheated everything and my goodness....I've never eaten that many crablegs and wanted more. The potatoes and corn were also delectable. The flavor involves a whole lot of garlicky seasoning and it melds so well with the tender crab meat. I have never been so sad and still hungry after a huge meal as this so I'll definitely swing by again next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Seafood Connection lives up to its hype for sure. My brother and I wanted something different for Super Bowl Sunday and we both agreed on Seafood Connection. Luckily he was willing to drive all the way to the restaurant in the rain to pick the food up for us. They do not have a phone number where you can call in so you just have to pray they are not sold out of whatever you are wanting. 
Luckily they were only sold out of fried and grilled food?? So we went with the steamed Super C-Port platter. Once placing the order the food was ready in 15 minutes. It may come in a normal size Styrofoam to-go box it is PACKED with food. A Super C-Port platter can definitely feed about 3-4 people. 
The sauce in the box is what makes everything so good. I can not even describe the butter sauce but it is soooo good! The seafood is quality and hearty. They definitely do not give you small, skimpy crab legs, lobster tails or shrimp that is not worth the money. Everyone agreed the sausage was amazing and I am in love with the corn on the cob. Unfortunately they are only opened on Friday-Sunday but it is definitely worth making a trip and trying."}
{"text":"Great stuff. Pop up restaurant looking to go main stream. Seafood is off the charts. Waits can be long but oh so worth it.  Get on the FB page so you can follow them. They need to be on t.v. because the food is just too good.  They have disciples for customers."}
{"text":"I heard about Seafood Connection through FB and Instagram.I did not order a platter as my appetite was not that big that day so I ordered some shrimp and seafood salad.The seafood salad did not meet my expectations.In my opinion,it was too salty and had too much going on.The shrimp were really big and juicy.However,the shrimp didn't have any seasoning on them or taste.I also wasn't that crazy about the butter sauce that everyone talks about.I think it may have been more appetizing on a platter which I will be trying next time.If you haven't been before they are operating out of another restaurant.I must say though,they have it very organized and business runs smoothly.They have wonderful customer service and polite attitudes.This was all through my observations as I waited in line.I was impressed!"}
{"text":"Well as it was my first time going I was super excited because I've heard so many things . I arrived with my girlfriend we ordered our food at the same time ,hers came out first . After waiting ten minutes the waiter came to tell me that it would be a few more minutes because it was Togo orders before mine (wasn't happy about that but ok) the waiter was nice he brung me French fries while I waited . 20 minutes later still no food my girlfriend has now finished her food ! Some date I finally received my food after 30 minutes and it was somehow cold  seems like a great place my girlfriends food was great .maybe it was just a bad day but for the prices I expected more .."}
{"text":"Words wouldn't do it. If you like seafood and even better if you like quality seafood then you just have to give these folks a try and soon. The only negative is that it's cash only but it will be well worth your stopping at the ATM. Ex. C-Port plate includes a lobster tail, crab legs, shrimp, sausage, an egg, potatoes, and a ear of corn all with some of the best spices ever. It had me sucking on the shells like they were crawfish heads. Does that tell you something."}
{"text":"After following this company for over a year, I was so excited to FINALLY try a plate for my birthday. Unfortunately, I was greeted by the most rude cashier I've ever had the displeasure of encountering. This place is expensive, I paid $40 for one plate, I didn't mind the price but when you pair that with rude service it's simply unacceptable. I went for a special day, but left a bit let down with the service. The food was great, but I might have to figure out the secret sauce at home since I can't see myself paying for subpar service ever again."}
{"text":"Food is excellent but they only accept cash. Don't be surprised by the long lines... it's a testament of how good the food is!"}
{"text":"Where to begin? I went to their pop up location on Friday at camp North end. This was my second time eating here, the first time I grabbed the food from King of Spicy. I brought a lot of friends with me this time and while the food got there after the line formed it was still just as good as the first time (and just as good as all the pictures! We all thoroughly enjoyed it and love that butter sauce! Even though we were pretty messy we really loved it! I can't wait until I go back! We each got shrimp and crab plates!"}
{"text":"So I decided to go to the Seafood Connection on a Sunday during CIAA weekend. The line was long as hell. So I waited to get inside. 1st let me tell you it was worth the wait!!! You can take it to go or stay and eat. They also have a bar for drinks if your sitting. I ordered the Super C-Port platter (fried), Crab Rice, Seafood Mac n Cheese & Season Fries. When I got home the food was still hot and you can smell the freshness of the seafood. The C-Platter had 2 Lobster tails, 8-10 Fried shrimp, 2 pieces of corn, potatoes, sausage (pork) & hush puppies. There was enough food for my wife and I to share, we both were stuffed when we were done. The food was absolutely amazing! Great place to eat REAL Seafood in Charlotte. A must go to!!!!!"}
{"text":"This deserves every star!  You get the bang for your buck.  I ordered the $35 platter not realizing it could feed a few folks 

Anytime I'm in Charlotte I'll be there now one star comes off because my $10 crab rice was hard.  We have to doctor it up"}
{"text":"Pack your patience but it's worth the wait. This was my first experience but won't be my last. Its probably best to plan on eating it there rather than to go. The Super C was just that  super,  rich in flavor."}
{"text":"First time here and I was so impressed!!! This is what I have been looking for in crab legs! It's a shame they are only open Friday-Sunday. This is close tie to my favorite place in Daytona beach.  Dangerous as it's in my own town and could find myself here weekly.  I was in and out in under twenty minutes. It's located in an old restaurant and were only serving takeout."}
{"text":"I think it's a little odd that the number that is listed, is disconnected. I wanted to call and order ahead so I wouldn't have to wait, but that clearly wasn't an option."}
{"text":"The food is delicious the plates are prepared just like the pictures show and they quantity and quality of the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"My Seafood soul looks back and wonders..... How did I survive before i was connected to the seafood connection? Food so good, I saw a lady almost stab her sister who was reaching for a shrimp!!!!  Only 1 word describes the flavor... #Rediculous!!!! Crazy good food, decent price, definitely worth the wait. Everything is good but my absolute favorite is the C-port platter (10-12 shrimp, crab leg cluster, and 1 lobster tail (best fried), with potatoes, corn, and a boiled egg (if your lucky) dipped in the \"special seasonings\"... $40. I went to Publix and tried to recreate this box of bold taste and it costs me over $100 and the great taste of Seafood Connection. Never Again! I encourage you to TREAT YO SELF!!! and eat everything you can.... #Yummy2MyTummy #JustMelApproved"}
{"text":"The best hands down. There food never disappoints. I just wish they were open daily. So that I can get it anytime. Once you've tried it once you will definitely become addicted. Best seafood in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Seafoood Connection: \"its something in the sauce\" I'll tell you what in the sauce...butter and more butter. I've had better seafood in Charlotte. Long wait, poor customer service and food is meh. My boyfriend and I both got the c-port platter. His was deep fried  and mines was stream. We got home and realized they had forgotten the clusters of crab legs on my boyfriend's platter. Try calling them to complain...what do you know, the phone they had on their receipt was not in service. WTH? The potatoes with the steam platter was so mushy...you might as well be eating mash potatoes with your seafood. The sauce is nothing but butter. It was so salty I couldn't finish my platter. There was no dipping sauce for the deep fried platter. Wanted to try this place out because of the hype. Was so disappointed. We overpaid for a bad experience."}
{"text":"I'm all for supporting black businesses and that's why I support over and over, but I don't think 8 will be back. Don't get me wrong the food is good, but I've been here so many times I can't count and they are always out of the same things, customer service isn't the best and you have wait outside near an hour to get your food. Need a better system to serve their customers. It was cold and windy and we were forced to stand outside smh.---"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and decided to come in.  It was a long wait outside the door so I knew it was going to be good. The line shorted for me once someone inside asked for takeout orders.  Inside was dim with sky lights used for lighting during lunch hours.  Gray walls and hip hop/r&b music playing.  Takeout orders were taken at the bar.  I knew what I wanted but waited for people ahead of me to decide.  Bad mistake because the wait was long enough.  I usually pay enough when I first try a new place but I wanted to be smart and not overdo it because it was a pricey spot.  Glad I did because I didn't care for my meal.  I got the boiled shrimp platter that came with potatoes and sausage with butter drenched over everything.  The potato was pretty much sliced open with shrimp on top, once piece of sausage, and two pieces of corn and little to no salted butter with parsley poured over it.  The corn was off the chain.  The shrimp didn't taste like the ocean or smell like it.  I only tasted one spot were salt was dashed.  I think I paid $17 and tax.  That's all I needed to pay."}
{"text":"This establishment was NOT aesthetically pleasing to me. It didn't look to me as if they were remodeling, as stated in a few reviews I read. There was a slight stale smell in the room/building. It took me about one hour, from standing in line to actually receiving the food I ordered. 

I ordered the steamed shrimp and crab combo, along with the fried shrimp and fish combo. The fried combo was seasoned well, warm, and edible, yet the fries were soggy. The overall combo wasn't worth the $17 price attached to it. 

The steamed combo was the most disappointing. The food was drenched in a buttery, salty seasoning sauce. It completely overwhelmed the combo and my tastebuds. The shrimp were NOT deveined and had a strong odor. I was unable to enjoy the corn and potatoes because of all the sauce it was drowned in. The meat in the crab legs were good. Maybe if the shrimp were deveined and the sauce was placed on the side in a plastic ramekin versus all over the food, this could have been a decent meal. 

Overall, my experience was not worth my time or the $45 I spent. This could have been an off day; but for the price, time, and environment I'm not willing to give it another chance. Also, I tried to call them but their mailbox was f"}
{"text":"Now, I must say I'm going to struggle putting this review together.  Here's why.  Food coma having just ate here.  Wow, the wife and I went out for a quick tubing adventure in Rock Hill and was driving back to CLT and thought, why not try this place now?  It was 2pm or so and the line was non-existent.  Order and out the door in less than 30mins.  

Once home, cracked open the to-go container and the seafood heavens opened up.  First off, non-butter lovers, stay away.  Now that is out of the way, let me just tell you there is nothing not to love about this meal or any meal they offer I imagine.  I had the C-Port platter and nearly ate all of it in one sitting.

The lobster tails were some of the best I've ever had (no I don't live in Maine or whatever but I know good food).  Do yourself a favor and make your own connection with Seafood Connection, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Today was my first time going and I must say it was perfect. I got the crab legs plate. The best I've ever had hands down. The sauce was amazing and they put a lot on the plate. Just wish they had somewhere to sit down and eat lol other than that definitely 5 stars. Look forward to going back !!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is ABSOLUTE LOVE!!! I just moved back to the area from Maryland and I was craving seafood badly! I heard many great things about this place, so I came here for the first time with my friend (who has never gone here before) and we lost our minds. So much food, very flavorful, and for a decent price. I plan to make it my mission to come back every weekend just for the shrimp/crab combo. Definitely makes any seafood platter I've had in Maryland taste like trash lol."}
{"text":"The Seafood Connection was a terrible idea! First Your greeted at the door by two gentlemen that don't have a clue about customer service in a restaurant. Not sure why one of them felt the need to carry a gun partly exposed in his pocket; the other one boasting about having access to another if needed? \"I just wanted to try the food for the first time... it felt like I was going into a club in a rough part of the city. They may as well have frisked me before entering. They make you stand in a line outside for at least 20 minutes before you can enter to sit down. My brother and I decided to forgo the dining experience and get the meal to go. The wait was even longer.

Now once inside, I can see the restaurant is half empty, lots of empty tables. The wait is because they are severely under staffed. Service is extremely slow. So we placed our order to go; I ended paying $17 for a $12 meal. I ordered the shrimp and flounder without hush puppies and extra fries; what I got was shrimp with fries and hush puppies. \" I should have checked my order before leaving\". Live too far and waited too long for the order. Tried to call the number on the receipt and of course their phone is not in service . My first intentions was I to go to Showmars. This was a horrible experience and a waste of time. 

Based on my business knowledge and professional opinion; the Owner/Manager was not ready to open. Piss poor planning! I predict this restaurant will be closed in 6 months!!!"}
{"text":"I heard about Seafood Connection about a year ago from my ecstatic son. He was apparently visiting a friend when the friend's girlfriend arrived home complaining about the one hour wait to receive good from Seafood Connection. This was when they were first operating out of the church parking lot. She had two orders of the C-note. But once they opened the boxes and started eating, all of that stress melted away. I finally arrived last Friday along with my sister. Their website said the hours were 11:30am-8pm but their Facebook page stated 12pm-8pm. Be sure to check their Facebook page for correct hours. We arrived around 11am after a trip to the Charlotte Regional farmers market and parked in the shade right in front of the King of Spicy bldg. Ppl began pulling up at around 11:30. We quickly got out and entered. There were already two young women sitting around the bar waiting and perusing their phones. So that meant that we were #3 in line. Order time was 12:05, at which point there was probably 20 other ppl there in line behind us. You jump up when the cashier says ok, taking orders now and basically line up around the bar in the order you arrived. We ordered two C-note, one Lock-in, an order of fried shrimp and a order of fried oysters. Total was $121. They have extra butter sauce behind the bar and several ppl ordered it but you really don't need bcuz ur dinner is smothered in the stuff. To end, that C-note was 3 meals for me!! So much food and so fresh and delicious!!!. Ppl will pay for quality and quantity also at Seafood Connection. I'm planning another visit this week. You surely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"there is one like him and none like him!!! being a b-more gurl ; i know real seafood... jamie is amazing and has come a long way, he has worked hard and pressed his way through all of the odds and his good shows that!! you get so much food it will carry you through a full day!!! the flavor is simply amazing!! i see this brand going to the top; celebrity status! welcome to charlotte jamie; i am so proud of you.... job well done... you are officially crowned the seafood king!! this food is amazing!! getchu some!!"}
{"text":"Very unprofessional! 

I waited outside for 1hr. To come into a restaurant full of empty tables this is not a efficiently running \"restaurant\" it is still being run like the food truck it use to be."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I decided to try this for a Father's Day treat to the Mister. He enjoyed every drop and loved the \"sauce\". The portions are generous. We had the steamed shrimp/crab platter (added extra shrimp) which comes with corn, potatoes, pork sausage and a side of crawfish. I highly recommend you giving them a try. The ONLY reason I didn't give them 5 stars, I didn't get the extra 2 sausages I paid for. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Alligator bites good flavor and nice size , just a little bit salty. The lobster and shrimp with potato, corn and sausage was also cooked well. The butter seasoning was great. I would ask for extra butter seasoning for the potato. Remember cash only, order on the other side of the bar when you enter, and keep your receipt to pick up the food."}
{"text":"I heard the all of the buzz and decided to check it out on my own.  I've heard the wait was an hour, cash only, shady setup, etc.  As I'm typing this even I wonder why I would subject myself to this place. 

I trolled SC on Facebook for a week or so to try to see how the starts would align and allow me to subject myself to a train wreck of an experience.   Apparently the seafood is extremely fresh and is brought in from coastal Georgia.  They are only open when they have a shipment.

Sooooo, today was the day.  They were open and welcoming all cash carrying seafood lovin' patrons and I was willing to oblige.  I pull into the parking lot, walk into The King of Spicy, yes they are housed up in another restaurant, and follow the dry erase marker arrows to the bar to place my order.  Man, I must be livin' life right because the wait was nothing!  I waited in line about 3-4 minutes to place my order.  The lady taking my order was extremely nice and helpful.  She was quick but I didn't feel rushed.  Once I handed over the cash I was given a number and told it would be ready shortly.  Based on the number of people sitting around with that \"I'm waiting for my food\" look I didn't expect \"shortly\" to happen.  I decided to walk around for a few, check emails, blah, blah, blah.  About 20 minutes later, my number came up.

First, that's about the heaviest bag of food I've ever carried but once I opened it I knew why.  This plate was packed with shrimp, lobster, sausage, corn and potatoes all smothered in a butter sauce.  Put on a bib cause it's fittin' to get messy!  This was a plate full of happiness!  I would have been happy to wait that hour or whatever everyone else was saying.  The shrimp and lobster were well cooked, not rubbery or over cooked at all.  The sausage was a nice touch but almost a distraction of the main attraction - the seafood."}
{"text":"I know folks love to say...\"well, I'm from ABC\" or \"I'm from XYZ\" so I know tacos. I know seafood. Here's my homage to such: 

I'm from Louisiana and I know to tell y'all....
1) I don't care for poop in my shellfish. Deveined isn't optional and I generally roll with it outside of Louisiana. Even more accepting with small businesses. 

Alternatively, I've spent enough time in Wisconsin to truly and genuinely appreciate BUTTER over Margarine. Margarine is SYNTHETIC and since they dump a lot...and I mean A LOT on top of the shellfish - I would genuinely and sincerely advise: Order anything without the use of \"buttah\" 

I won't go on about the service. I will congratulate these folks for setting up shop and outpacing the Indian restaurant that used to be here. I waited for 100+ reviews before adding mine in order to avoid lowering their stars. 

Oh! And someone could lay off some of the salt on that fried lobster tail. 
Clean up the snow crab legs or consider buying live crabs and killing them a certain way (as there are a multitudes) then the gunk won't be in the meaty area. 
The potatoes I had were brown Russett not new red skin potatoes. I chalked it up to maybe that's their budget or how things are done around the Carolina's.  
I don't need the boiled egg. 
The sausage is pork based not wholly beef. 

Glad I found it via social media and will try any place with a fried lobster tail. 

Here's to hoping things really take off and then maybe we'll get true authentic Butter. Even the no-name HT brand over this margarine. :/"}
{"text":"In love with this food!!!! The shrimp, crab legs, lobster, corn, sausage, potatoes all the way down to the butter!!! OMG!!! I want it every weekend and I save on buying lunch n coffee so I can eat here on Saturdays. Guilt free! The best seafood EVER!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time going here at I was very curious about if the food was as good as I was told because the line was very long I mean wrapped around the building long but after waiting on line for about an hour it actually was worth the wait if you are planning on checking them get there an hour before they open or you will be waiting they only let a certain amount of people in at a time an security at the door is tight like you will b waiting to get inside but all in all the food was worth the wait and the price wasnt to bad a little expensive but it's not bad"}
{"text":"This place is amazingly delicious. We came at a lucky time, there were about 5 people in line ahead of us, the wait to order was about 6 minutes and just enough time for us to decide what we want.  There were 3 of us, my mom and I shared the steamed crab and shrimp meal (forget the name on the menu, it had 2 crab legs and like 12 shrimp) and my stepdad ordered a fried fish platter. They offer water and sweet tea as drink options. 

The steamed meal came out first, ahead of the Other meal by about 10 minutes. I took a picture but after my mom scooped a couple shrimp and her crab so it's a little light in the photo but the lid of the container couldn't even close. It was DELICIOUS. Absolutely no way to improve unless they could add something to help break the crab with bc it was a little labor intensive. It could have fed 3-4 people. We left many shrimp and barely got to touch the potato and corn. Everything was amazing. 

We didn't pay much attention to my stepdads meal but he said it was delicious and he can be difficult to please so that carries some weight. 

Oh my mom just said we ordered the \"super combo\""}
{"text":"We got there 90 minutes before closing time.  We were told that they closed the dinning area early and we're only taking to go orders.  We were travelling and it was almost seven, so we decided to order there.  Big mistake.  They were out of half the menu.  We settled on just fish and shrimp plates.  The wait was not long, but when we got our order there was no ketchup for the fries, no tarter for the fish, no sauce for the shrimp.  We asked and were told they had only tarter sauce.  They gave us three generic foil packs of sauce for over $50 of fried fish!  When we got back to our hotel we discovered they gave us no plasticware to eat with.  So here I sit, eating undercooked rice with my fingers in my room.  The only thing well cooked were my scallops, but they were gritty as though they were not washed properly."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best seafood in Charlotte. Everything I have had at this place is amazing. It's hard to get legit seafood when you're not on the coast but they have it here."}
{"text":"Came in town for the day to hang out with my girlfriends. She found this place earlier in the week and sent us pics of the food and we were all in! When we first pulled up, there was a looonnnng line out front which turned us away being that it was hot and we were short for time. About 30 minutes later, we see there is no line and decide to try again. We stood in a very short line, finally got to the front to order and it was very strange. You have to order your food first, find a seat and then they bring it to you. I ordered the scallop dinner with veggies and the crab rice. After sitting for about 25 minutes, our food arrives at different times. The crab rice was very salty initially. The scallops were cooked perfectly. After tasting my friends food, we all agreed it was overrated. Everything was salty. Would I come back if I was in Charlotte again? Probably not. For the price and the set up, it was a bit of a turn off."}
{"text":"So since my comment was deleted on their instagram post I guess I'll share my review with my fellow yelpers...lol. The sauce is the best thing they have going. The food was ok but the biggest let down was the mushy shrimp! My sisters and I were so disappointed. Oh and the crab rice was dryyyyy. I was really hoping to get my seafood fix down here in Charlotte since I'm from the \"seafood city DC\". I'd return just to buy the sauce."}
{"text":"I am from Savannah so I love seafood. This place gives me my seafood fix when I cant get home. It is really good, seasoned well and will have you licking your fingers. The plates are jammed packed with seafood, they do skimp on the sausage though. My only complaints are there is always a line. I wait at least an hour every time and its a little expensive. Being from the coast , I know how much this stuff truly cost but I still pay it anyway, DON'T JUDGE ME. I just need to find the right time to go where there isn't a jammed packed line and I can be in an out. Maybe they can do call in orders."}
{"text":"First time visitor.  First off the food tastes great and looked great.  A girlfriend and I split a plate and we both were satisfied.  I cant remember the name of what we ordered but it came with 2 lobster tails, 2 snow crab clusters, 10-14 shrimp, 4 pieces of corn, potatoes,  and half a sausage.  Found it weird that you only get half a sausage with a plate of this size, but anyhoo.  Cost was $65.00. A little high, but I kinda understand why.  

The wait was entirely to long.  We arrived and the line was out the door.  A guy comes out and says follow me if your getting take out. We followed him inside where we got in line to order take out, the line was wrapped around the bar.  At one point the cashier says we have to stop taking orders for 20 minutes because the kitchen is backed up.  From start to finish was about an hour and 15 minutes. My two stars is because of the wait time,  the staff was friendly and the area that I was in was clean."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 1.5, but I can't. I'm trying to figure out where these other reviewers ate so I can find this GREAT seafood they're raving about. I have visited this place twice. Fool me once-shame on you. Fool me twice-can't put the blame on you! My first visit I didn't even order because the line was RIDICULOUSLY long, I asked a woman and her adult son how long they waited-she told me 3 hours! WHAT? I'm not even at the DMV for 3 hours. Needless to say, I left. So yesterday *insert face palm emoji* I decided to give it another shot, I had to know if the bark was equivalent to the bite. After waiting, and waiting to order I received dry customer service. After waiting over an hour (for steamed seafood) I asked if I could get my money back, the other patrons were looking at me as if I was insulting their mother. The person at the register kept giving me the run around and magically my food was ready. I saw someone else mention they have a cult following, ha! It's true. I'm sorry but I just can't see spending my hard earned money and waiting long enough to finish half of a Netflix series, time and time again. These people wait for hours on end for a mediocre, at best, dining experience. The food was not all that! I've been cracking crabs, throwing back shrimp, shucking oysters since I was 3! No exaggeration. So I KNOW good seafood. I'm not going to front, it smelled delicious from the box. However, upon opening it I immediately recognized the \"butter\" as a Parkay type imitation. The shrimp seasoning was nothing but garlic salt-beware if you are a sufferer of high blood pressure. The potatoes were flavorless, sausage under cooked, the eggs and corn were the best part! I'm not hard to please by any means, I've eaten at some sketchy hole-in-the-wall places and received better food and service. If you're thinking of going here, stop...you can prepare a much better seafood boil at home for less $$ and time. Please GET IT TOGETHER, Seafood Connection."}
{"text":"Love the food after removing all the butter, I order the c-port it was so much butter I had butter soup at the bottom of my order I washed off the food and reheated in a roaster pan to remove all the excess butter. I would order again with season and butter on the side I want to taste my food not the butter"}
{"text":"I drove 1 hour and 30 minutes from Greensboro just to try this place. I would definitely recommend trying their food, but next time I will order to go. When you walk in, either you go to one side to sit in or the other for take out. Either way, you're ordering and paying for your food right away. Oh and don't forget to mention if you want a drink because I had no idea to do this at the front. It was busy when I came, but I was able to find a seat. They have a dog on the tables that says 1 hour max for eating in customers...The place was hot and it felt like there was no AC, but the music they were playing was all the way up my alley! Our waitress wasn't the friendliest and didn't stop at the table much. The food took around 35-40 minutes to come out, but it was so delicious. I had the connect platter (1 cluster crab legs/2 lobster tails) for $38 and added on shrimp for $10. You get potatoes, two pieces of corn, and about a quarter of a sausage. You will be eating with your hands the whole time (not sure if silverware is even an option), so don't be shy! They have paper towels on the table for you. I won't drive there again unless I'm already in the area (just too far for me being in Greensboro) and although I loved the music, I did not enjoy sweating while eating, nor the service, so in the future I will get take out."}
{"text":"***I was not able to try the food, so I am only reviewing the facility***After hearing rave reviews of this pop up kitchen/hole in the wall, I thought I would give it a try. I made sure to come early in the day thanks to my other Yelpers who let me know that they run out of things quickly. I was a little alarmed that when we went to walk up to the register to order, we were yelled at and told to wait behind a line about 6 feet away until we were called over. Then, when we were called up we noticed a bouncer by the cashier....which is a little concerning, but let me remind you that this is a hole in the wall, and hey! hole in walls often have the best food. Well, everything myself and my group wanted to order was sold out. EVERYTHING. Also, this is cash only AND the ATM was broken....which made a lot of people leave. The food is pricey, but it is seafood. However, due to being a hole in the wall, you do expect a little cheaper prices. We were unable to order ANYTHING we wanted and it was only 11 am.... they were very unapologetic, so we did not have a great experience this time but I would love to come again to try it. There must be a reason it was all sold out, right?!"}
{"text":"(1) one word:  Genocide!
Enough butter to kill a horse! Turning cold before you can leave the building... To the people who say \"best seafood they have ever eaten\"... Clearly never ventured outside there home or 600 miles! Commiting Genocide against your own people! To the people standing inline waiting are the fattest, Laziest on Earth. Could buy, clean (clean your shrimp yourself) season, steam for half the price and zero travel time. Even add $7 bottle of wine for these prices. $11 - $30???  All you getting for $11 is a side of something.... I'm all about uplifting my people but this is not right!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I feel like I have watched them grow from a food truck to an establishment. The food is delicious and consistent. There is a little wait time...but the best things are worth waiting for."}
{"text":"3.75 stars, although having a shorter wait would easily push it to 4 stars!

A few things to get out of the way before I start:

1.) The wait will be long.
2.) It will likely be busy.
3.) You order and pay as soon as you come into the door, if dining in. If ordering for takeout, go directly to the bar area to order and wait.
4.) It is only open on the wknds, Thur-Sun.

Now onto the experience,.....the food was really good! I ordered the \"C-Port\", a steamed platter with a snow crab leg cluster, shrimp, a lobster tail, one piece of Rogerwood sausage and the typical potatoes and corn. I also ordered a side of the crab rice. The platter was full to the brim and packed with flavor, but would have done well to have a full link of sausage in it instead of just a measly half. I found myself wanting another piece of it. If you ask me they could have given half the amount of potatoes (which I ate none of by the way, b/c they were sort of an afterthought and weren't cooked softly enough) & another piece of the sausage. I would pass on the crab rice altogether, it was pretty lackluster and a bit dry,  although full of real crab. I have one MAJOR bone to pick with the seafood platter though, there was not an ounce of Old Bay seasoning anywhere! As a Philly girl, I don't understand seafood that isn't seasoned in part with Old Bay! Their seasoning is more garlic based and tangy. It was good, but man I was jonesin' for some Old Bay. I even asked the server for some...which they of course had none of. 

The service was good as well. The wait after sitting down was long. It took at least 40 mins to receive my meal, and it still arrived lukewarm! But, the servers were definitely attentive and accessible and heated my food up promptly. 

Overall, I can wholeheartedly recommend this spot. It will definitely take care of your weekend seafood craving!"}
{"text":"I've been seeing this place in my Facebook feed for weeks. The pics are crazy delicious looking, the comments of glowing praise almost cult-like. I had to go check it out for myself. Is the hype real? Yes. 

First things first, follow them on their social medias to see when they are open and what hours. It's kind of all over the place, and they could close early if they sell out of everything.

Currently, this pop up type business is sharing a kitchen with the Indian restaurant King of Spicy. When you walk through the door, KOS is to the left and Seafood Connection operates out of the bar to the right. There's a bouncer who greets you (why is there a bouncer? I have no clue). He'll point you to the line to place your order. I went the day before Easter at a random mid-afternoon time. There wasn't that long of a line. I've heard it can get crazy, crazy busy. So, just be prepared. I've heard it does move quick. Also, don't wait too late in the day in case they do get slammed and run out of things. I went with the Connect Platter (lobster and crab legs). Along with the crab leg cluster and lobster, it includes a piece of sausage, corn on the cob, potatoes and a couple deviled eggs. Total with tax was $30. This is a cash-only concept. There is an ATM at the restaurant. 

Note: there's not a ton of places to sit here. They pack up the orders in a to-go fashion, I would plan to take it home and enjoy. If you don't like butter and seasoning, you won't enjoy this. It's not healthy by any means, but it's pretty damn delicious. Everyone here was so nice and it didn't take long to get my food. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Seafood Connection is def the most popular seafood spot in the Queen City at the moment. I'm so glad they have a full time home in the old King of Spicy spot on Albemarle. 

If you plan to come try them out plan to wait. Whether it's to sit down inside or to order to go you will wait. The togo waits seems a little shorter of a line. On my visit I chose to eat inside. From wait outside til getting our food it was about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Everything is boxed togo which makes it very convenient. 

Once you get inside you place your order with a cashier at a register up front. All togo orders are paced at the bar. Then you seat yourself and have a number that you place on the table. Once you sit your sever greets you and brings your drinks. Our server was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. 

Our fried order came out first and we were able to nibble on that until the steamed orders came out. We ordered the Fried Shrimp Plate, the Steamed Crab Plate, the Steamed Shrimp Plate and the Steamed Lock Jaw Plate. 

The fried shrimp was really good. A lot of flavor and good amount of seasoning. The shrimp are also a very good size. My friends had the Crab Plate. They throughly enjoyed it but would have liked the crab pinchers to crack the shells and be able to get to more of the meat. I had the Lock Jaw Plate. It was very good. The lobster was delicious and I was able to dip the meat in the seasoned butter that was trapped in the shell. I added the season egg and it wasn't good. I would skip that. I meant to order extra sausage but forgot. Once we had started eating we noticed we didn't have any sausage with our meals at all. When we brought it to our server's attention he said they had run out about an hour ago. It would have been nice to know and perhaps given another piece of corn or something. My only other issue with the food is that all the season is on the outside of the meat which is in a shell. It would have been nice to have extra dipping sauce or seasoning for my shrimp and the crab meat. I did find some trapped under the corn but it wasn't enough. 

Now there was a slight issue with the restrooms on our visit as well. The women's restroom had flooded and I was instructed to use the men's restroom. Upon entering the men's room there were 2 stalls but one didn't have a door and the other was locked so with that being said I didn't use the restroom. 

Not sure if I will eat inside on my next visit or do togo but I'm sure I will be back to try the brunch and the sausage!!!

{"text":"The line is always out the door ! But that tells you something ... the food is amazing and always fresh. The only reason why I don't give it a 5 star, is because for my taste , the need to put less buttery taste to it. Make sure to bring cash because the they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this place for several months and finally made it. The food was cooked to perfection. I ordered the crab and fried shrimp plate. It was around $40. I'm so glad I got the fried shrimp wich was an extra $3.80 I believe. The service was pretty smooth I was in and out in 20 minutes.

I will defenitly go back to this place and I am looking forward to it becoming a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Wooo Lord have mercy! So good and worth every penny.  I suggest making sure you check Facebook for their operating hours, as it seems to vary from week to week.  The number that they have no one ever picks up-so no call in either. As someone else brought up basted in some flavorful butter concoction-so definitely not just some lightly steamed seafood fit for a calorie or fat restricted diet."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try out the Seafood Connection restaurant, after hearing great things.  I had the grilled flounder, and she had the crab legs and shrimp.  The food was great, and we could have easily shared one order.  You definitely get a healthy serving of great tasting food.  I did want to try the scallops, but they were not available except on weekends.  Our food was ready in about 15 minutes or less.  There is a bar area, but doesn't serve alcohol at this point.  We did takeout, but there were plenty of tables available, had we decided to eat in. You do put your order in at the front, but that was no issue.   Of course on weekends that might not be the case, based on the volume of business this place gets.  We were very pleased overall, and the staff treated us perfectly."}
{"text":"10 stars for this location. The food was outstanding and everyone was happily satisfied. Will be back and recommend the variety tray wit lobster shrimps and cluster of crabs."}
{"text":"Food was GREAT enjoyed every moment of it... love we have a seafood place in Charlotte"}
{"text":"I am sick of the reviews stating how much butter they put on stuff, look at the pictures before going...they drench the seafood in butter. I'm telling you this now, so if you don't like it, just don't go. Butter is good and this food is good. It's obviously not to have everyday.  This was my first visit here and it was a Friday night around 6:30. There was a line and we had to wait outside of the door for a bit before ordering and then getting a table. After being seated there was a wait for the food. Take a good friend and time will fly. 

Everyone was friendly: the cashier and the waitress. The waitress came to check on us about 2 times. Everything is in styrofoam containers, which was fine by me because I knew it was clean. The restaurant interior was clean and very large. It does need some updating, but this place is not about ambiance. 

I ordered the Lock Jaw: lobster and shrimp which came with potatoes and corn, oh and a tiny sausage. The lobster and corn was my favorite-delicious!!!! The shrimp was just ok for me. I would come back and order carry out next time. Also get more lobster if possible. I probably would not get the shrimp again. 

This place is about experience and trying new things. At least try once, I'd only for the lobster...which you must try!"}
{"text":"We dined at seafood connection on Saturday. Sure it was CIAA weekend so we were already expecting a wait. We arrived and we were seated as soon as we walked in the door. Our waitress was new and she was very pleasant. She took our drink orders and then came back to take our food orders. We placed our orders around 220. Around 330 were wondering where our food is. Another waitress with an ipad comes over as she has noticed we have been sitting there for quite some time and ask did anyone take our order. We tell her yes and she ask did they put it in the ipad and did we pay. We didnt because no one told us that was part of the policy. So we asked for a manager. The manager/owner from what she told us attitude about fixing the problem was ill put a rush on it. We asked her if anything would be taken off of the bill or if she would compensate us with an appetizer or extra food or just any thing for the inconvenience and her answer was a stern no. We advised that it was a very pleasant experience to see multiple tables of people who came in after us eating and we were still sitting there. We advised that since our waitress was new someone should have been making sure she knew how things worked. Her response was DONT TIP HER!  
This really upset me. Cuz as a business owner you should want to make sure your employees are doing a good job and are happy. It also upset me because she wanted to make sure she was getting all of her money but didnt care if her server was paid. At that point i was done. 
We waited another 10-15 mins for our food and i cant even lie the food was good. It was very flavorful, the only downside was it was sitting in a pool of butter."}
{"text":"Poseidon smiles upon the hands that bless us with the aquatic cuisine at Seafood Connection. It lives up to the hype. On a Friday afternoon, around 4:30, I waited an hour and a half before ordering, followed by 10 minutes for the food to come out. Despite the time, it was love at first bite. This is great seafood. So good, I returned 5 days later for another round. The second visit, a Wednesday at 2:15, there was practically no wait. I was in and out in 15 minutes.

The food is seasoned to perfection with lots of butter. This is Not healthy seafood, so pack your cholesterol meds. Food is served in a takeout box, whether you choose to eat in or not. At first blush, the price point is on the high side, but compared to other sit down restaurants, your Red Lobsters and such, it's right on par. You're just getting better quality and tasting seafood here.

On my most recent visit I had the Super C-Port platter. It included 2 crab clusters, 4 - 1/2 lobster tails, 16 jumbo shrimp, 4 pieces of sausage, 2 pieces of corn on the cob, and what amounts to 2 whole potatoes. Enough to feed 3. 

They should do a better job of stating how much of everything you're getting with each meal (i.e. \"2 clusters\" .... \"16 shrimp\"). The menu leaves lots of questions. As far as service, they're friendly enough. No one is bringing food to your table, so there's not much to judge by.

Some things to note: Cash only. Open randomly in no discernible pattern - check the IG or FB page for open dates, which are posted night before or morning of. Located inside of King of Spicy restaurant.

Thank me later."}
{"text":"Speechless!  What is in that sauce?!?!  Finally tried it today to see what the hype was all about...the connection was real!  Crab legs, shrimp, corn in the cob, potatoes were all delicious.  And that one fried lobster tail was OMG!  Pricey but well worth it!  Loved it and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best damn fried shrimp i have had in many many years!!! Ive been craving it ever since.  And the line and wait was not terrible!  Customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Food was great .. came here for my birthday.. I will be returning Birthday Dinner ( crab legs, shrimp, corn on the cob, potatoes, sausage, and this amazing seasoning) couldn't finish it all so ate the rest the next day and let me tell you ... the food taste even better the second time because all that seasoning set .. I have already told friends and family about this place. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that my husband would give this spot five stars BUT this is my yelp page so I'm gonna roll with four stars. We recently went here for dinner with some friends and were excited to see what the fuss was all about. I ordered the steamed crab legs and shrimp and it was pretty dang tasty. My husband got the steamed lobster tail and crab legs and raved about his. The service was great! It is a no-frills, good food kinda spot and I'm with it. There were only two things that would've made it better for me. I found the seasoning on the potatoes to be a bit too salty (my husband says that he thought it was perfect) and we all agreed that the crab was kinda hard to get out of the shell because it was slightly overcooked. We didn't get the perfect pieces of crab popping out but more of the shredded crab consistency.

That being said, overall - it's worth the hype and a good local spot."}
{"text":"Just ate at this place for the first time today. My husband and I were in town for the Earth, Wind and Fire concert and we found the spot on Yelp.  The food offerings reminded us of a place in the Atlanta, Ga area called What's Crackin. They do garlic crabs and shrimp boils and serve large portions.  Seafood Connection was not nearly as good in comparison. We had the Super C Port, which was $65.  The shrimp was mushy... normally my favorite... but i ate only one.  The crabs and lobster were fair. There was only 1 piece of sausage in the plate and 2 pieces of corn.  And the rest of the plate was potatoes.  Perhaps my view is skewed because What's Crackin has better food and a better value for the money. Seafood Connection was okay but we won't go back.  If you are in the ATL, check out What's Crackin on Candler Road and you will \"taste\" the difference and your meal will be less expensive but still very filling with seafood, more sausage and corn versus potatoes."}
{"text":"I've heard this is some of the best seafood in Charlotte and after trying it, I don't disagree. 

Our visit here didn't start out very good, but the food more than made up for it. You can either get your food to go or sit down. We chose to sit down and sat there for 15 minutes without anyone even coming to get a drink order. After the other tables around us were ordering, I finally said something and 5 minutes later someone finally took our order. 

Unfortunately, they were out of a few things. We tried to get seafood salad and eggs, but they were out of both. 

We split a C-Port which had shrimp, lobster, and crab legs. The shrimp were huge, but you did have to take the shell off yourself which was pretty annoying. The lobster was probably my favorite part. The crab legs were good, but I always think they're a lot of work for the amount of meat you get. They also don't have anything to crack them with which makes it challenging. The sausage that came with it wasn't that great in comparison. The whole thing is served in a pool of butter and seasoning. It was a lot of food, more than enough to split. 

The amount of butter is any keto-eaters be dream. It was delicious and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is great and by far the best seafood I've had in Charlotte. The business is growing and the service seem to be improving. I have waited 40 minutes before, my last visit even with several customers before me I got me food in half the time. This is a cash only restaurant, but they have an ATM in the front of the restaurant. Even though you can dine in, I always take my food home. And each time, I find they left something out. Every platter comes with corn, potatoes and sausage, I have been short a sausage or corn nothing major like a crab leg so I will still return. The portions are huge so you can share or have leftovers. They are only open Friday, Saturday and Sunday which sucks because they are so good, I can eat there everyday. If you are a seafood lover this would definitely be a great spot."}
{"text":"Long wait time (1.5 hrs) but the food was worth it. We arrived at the restaurant around 6 pm on a Saturday. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of food, it was seasoned well and the price was reasonable. I purchased two trays - crab cluster and shrimp. My sister and I shared the tray for dinner on both Saturday and Sunday. The food warmed up well...we warmed the food in the oven in an aluminum pan. We live about 20 minutes away from the Seafood Connection - will be our first choice if we have the taste for seafood."}
{"text":"They list all the items that are not available on the wall with the menu. This was my first time going here and I was just passing through Charlotte picking people up from the airport but it was totally worth it. This place will be packed when they finish the renovations to have a sit down place but for takeout yummy. I had the fried shrimp and fish platter and it was sooooo good I didn't even need Ketchup or any sauce. I also order the steam shrimp. They are very large and flavorful. Lastly I ordered the super combo with two clusters of crad legs and shrimp plus it came with corn, potatoes,and sausage  if you are second guessing this place give the a try. Please remember that they are cooking seafood so don't expect to get your  food in fifteen minutes plus with all the orders they have you mag have to wait a bit but it's worth it OMG."}
{"text":"Good food but longer than expected wait for the food to come out. I understand why they dont take cards (after talking to an employee) but I still expect it for any place where the meal is over $15. I don't live in the state but I would definitely go back next time I am in town.
Went on a Friday around 130 pm...only a few ppl in line ahead of me...got the fried fish and shrimp."}
{"text":"I love this place .. now you can sit down and enjoy your meal .. I've been following them from the church to the new home which is gorgeous.. A Must for great seafood"}
{"text":"Everything at this place taste amazing. So nicely seasoned and you get so much food for your money"}
{"text":"yesterday I wanted to try something new and I purchased the grilled shrimp plate with grilled vegetables and crab rice, it wasn't that good. I don't know if it was the wrong time (@ 5pm) in me ordering the food because the crab rice was extremely dry, and the grilled shrimp and vegetables were warm. I usually get the crab plate which is always good but I will not be purchasing the grilled plates anymore."}
{"text":"Got work to do. This is not my first time here. Although, I don't come regular I've came a few times before. I Walked in and they were busy but not as busy as it was when I left l. I ordered  a crab and shrimp plate and a veggie plate. Cashier said about 20/25 min wait. I knew it would probably take longer tho.  After waiting about 25 mins I decided to add a shrimp plate. 10 mins later my shrimp plate came, and waited another 10 or so mins for my original order that was placed 35 mins prior smh but anywho, I check my food and knew immediately that the food was cold. I had to travel 20 mins so I didnt make a big fuss. My other food came and I left. Got to my car and dug into my veggie plate and it was also cold. I was not happy but didn't make a fuss about it either. But never in a million years should anyone be served cold food ESPECIALLY after waiting almost 45 mins! What are y'all doing back there in the kitchen to where people are being served cold food? I just don't get it. Plus I'm not the only one who has made this comment on Yelp. If I'm paying MY money AT ANY establishment whether it be at seafood connection, McDonald's, Firebirds, or Bentleys, I want HOT and FRESH food. I didn't feel like making a big fuss today because I did have about a 20 min ride home but if I were served this sitting down and it was cold I would have pitched a fit and sent it back....Immediately! PLEASE work on this and get it together.  Please recognize the issues and fix them. I know y'all have your ride and dies that will be down with you all no matter what, but not everyone expects mediocre food and service."}
{"text":"Best seafood every and the staff is so friendly. I can't wait to go back ! I love the crab/shrimp plate with extra sauce ."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here  about 2 weekends ago and just now getting a chance to review. We both been raving about it ever since and I keep looking at the pic I took of the grilled shrimp and crab legs we had! Totally delish!!!! Was worth the trip from Gastonia. Highly recommended for the quality and the price!! I'll make sure to get the crab rice and an extra plate when I come back."}
{"text":"Amazing is an understatement. I am never disappointed. The best seafood I have tasted anywhere in and out of state."}
{"text":"I was in town for the day and I HAD to stop by here after coming across their instagram page. The line was out the door and they had to stop taking orders bc they were behind (they stopped taking orders for about 30 mins). You could see the confusion on the cashier's face (she was talking and didn't realize that they told her to begin taking orders again) and the frustration of the kitchen crew. Although we waited an hour, the food was AMAZING and worth the wait. It is very well seasoned and the pricing is reasonable. They give good portions. I will be coming back. The wait is expected when the food is so good."}
{"text":"A whole lot of butter sauce but it was delicious. Pricey so definitely not a place for the regular especially because of the amount of butter. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This is the best seafood ,corn on cob and potatoes I've ever had ,this food hits the spot immediately, really addictive, finger licking good"}
{"text":"So this place is currently sharing a kitchen with the King of Spice restaurant (look for their sign when trying to find the place). I didn't understand the hype before today because my friend woke me up on a Saturday morning (grrr) to tell me that we should be ready to go once she got the notification. Again, I didn't understand the exclusivity but I figured \"oh, what the hell\" and gathered my life to get out the bed! Let me tell you... I'm not even mad! Lol 

The hour of operations varies and they also operate on different days of the week because the kitchen space is shared. For the most up to date information, refer to their IG page (@seafoodconnectioncharlotte). The IG will also provide an update on what items aren't available from their menu for that particular day. 

IF THE LINE IS LONG...STAY THERE! Seriously, it moves faster than any place I've been where the food is made to order! I will not disclose how long we waited because it varies day to day and I don't want to discourage anyone's tummy (but prepare to be patient for at least 1.5 hours). Also, they operate as CASH ONLY (no exceptions). If you forget cash then there is an ATM available... but save yourself the headache and just bring cash before you arrive. Also, the prices aren't budget friendly so check out the menu before you offer to pick up plates for others! BUT IT'S WORTH IT (my pregnant friend gave it the motherly stamp of approval since she still had food left over). 

The customer service is wonderful and even though the people behind you will want you to rush, the cashier will be friendly and helpful (in no way am I condoning that you take your sweet time though, lol). 

All in all.... I will be back there!! Maybe sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Yum seafood! We ordered the crab legs and shrimp combo that came with corn, potatoes and sausage. Full of flavor! I only wish I could get some spice but thats just me, gotta have extreme spiciness. 
There's definitely a long line so plan accordingly, they do pump out quickly and only open Friday, Sat and Sun."}
