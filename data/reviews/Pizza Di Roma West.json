{"text":"So good! NY style slices with loads of fresh toppings, huge pasta menu, and the dining area is lovely and spacious.   If you have loved slices from Pizza di Roma on State, the new west side location is an even nicer place to dine in!"}
{"text":"Glad to have Pizza Di Roma as a choice on the west side. Went for lunch and pizza was great. Great selection and the slice prices are perfect. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice in the past month. Closest thing to NY-style we've found in this area. Good crust and fresh toppings. Salads also made with fresh greens. I could do without the flavorless hothouse tomatoes on the salads, though. It's the middle of the summer, so no excuse for foodservice tomatoes. Friendly, efficient service is great, too. It seems kind of empty when we've been here. I hope the slightly off-the-beaten path location isn't a detriment and that people start finding it soon."}
{"text":"This is my first experience with Pizza Di Roma. Stopped by after noticing the sign listing them as open this past Tuesday evening (July 11th). Ordered a pie to-go. I was impressed with the quality of the pizza: - Crust is a nice balance of crisp-chew. - Sauce is really, really, nice with bright tomato flavor and nary a hint of sugar to be found (no offense to the native 'Sconnies, but it does seem as if you folks do like your 'za sauces on the sweet side). - Amount and quality of the toppings were top-notch (pepperoni and sliced tomatoes). They are using deck ovens to bake their pies, which is a check in their favor. Service was pleasant, but you can tell they are still figuring things out.  It will be interesting to see what they do with the cavernous space they acquired. Also, the prices were actually reasonable. $12.13 final total for a 14\" 2-topping authentic NY-style pie?  Definitely one of the better non-chain pizza bargains I've seen in Madison. Count me as a fan. A welcome addition to the West side."}
{"text":"Although the pizza is great I would definitely recommend eating at the restaurant and not getting delivery. I ordered delivery twice from their website and was told it would take 45 minutes both times. Both times my pizza didn't arrive for an hour and a half and both times it was cold."}
{"text":"Again one of those places where you really look forward to having it, however, multiple things fall flat on expectations. This is a bar that serves New York style pizza, sandwiches, pasta, and has Tv's for sports. Great start. Smart to expand as well considering Sbarro was the only option up until a few years ago for a slice on demand on the west side.  The place is casual and a good for a local hang out.  Several pies are on display for customers choice. It looks like when I went there that a few were sitting out for a few hours. Appeared stale. After ordering the pizza was warmed. Looking forward to biting into it, I encountered a dry and overcooked crust, not enough cheese, and extra grease.   There exists a relative inefficiency as well with staff. They need to figure out some type of assignment or something as the scatter brained service amongst three different servers made no sense and ended up confusing me.  I'll skip the part about the house flys in the kitchen, but know they are present."}
{"text":"I've been in this here city four decades now.  It'll be my fifth soon.  This is hands down The Best pizzeria in the city currently and for all modern time.  I have proven Greco-Roman ancestry and I am very particular and demanding when it comes to my pizza.  I've had great pizza in Boston, New York, New Jersey, California and even Italy.  Pdr west delivers excellent product.  Highly recommended.  When I'm in for a slice I try to leave a generous tip whenever I can because these folks deserve it."}
{"text":"Still feeling mediocre about this place. I gave it another shot and was pleased with the mozzarella sticks but less than excited about the pizza. It was barely warm, skimped on the topping, and really floppy (I don't know how else to describe it)."}
{"text":"This was just really great pizza, New York Style (although I am by no means an expert), but it's thinner hand tossed crust that is full of flavor. The sauce is fresh and tastes that way, you can taste the herbs that they use as they pop when you bit into it. The other ingredients are just as good. I have yet to dine in at this place, but it will be a the place I will be ordering from when I'm on the west side."}
{"text":"This is the only good New York slice in town. Good calzones too. Now I don't have to drive downtown."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon, around 12:15pm.   The lot was empty. The sign said, \"Open\" so we went in.   While the doors were unlocked, the lights were off in the entire building and no one seemed to be present. We'd never had that happen before.   There was a door \"bell\" that went off when we went in, but no one came out.  Needless to say, this restaurant isn't doing well.   Find another place."}
{"text":"This is a really good pizza place. Many options, fast serice, large dining space, fresh, and tasty. Highly reccomend."}
{"text":"Best New York style pizza anywhere in the Madison area - along with their State Street location (which I remember was called Sal's back when I first found it).  Only bad thing is they've stopped doing delivery, which seems like a death knell for a pizzeria!  I hope they can manage to stay open, it's my family's favorite pizza (we're transplants from NJ)."}
{"text":"Yum!  I saw this new west side restaurant and thought I would give it a try.  My Hawaiian pizza (build your own) is delightful.  A nice blend of flavors and soft/crunchy crust! We will be back."}
{"text":"We had recently driven by and spotted this place - hadn't heard they were opening, so it was a pleasant surprise! We've had our share of late night slices at the downtown location, so knew to expect a NY style pizza, that you can't find anywhere else on this side of town.   We ordered a 20\" Presto to go (yeah, there is only two of us. Don't judge.): Mozzarella, Tomatoes, Basil and garlic. When we got there, they had no record of our order, so that was pretty annoying. On the plus side, this allowed us to try four different kinds (by the slice), and they only charged us for two slices to make up for it. It worked.   They had quite a variety of slices to choose from, so besides the Presto, we got a buffalo chicken, a sausage/pepperoni, and a Caprese (fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, red onions, basil and green olives). They popped them in the oven to warm them up and get the nice crispy NY crust. Since we got them to go, we ran the risk of a soggy crust, which unfortunately did occur to a couple of them because of the Caprese juicy tomatoes. That one had a few too many ingredients- better to keep it simple so you can make the perfect NY fold of the slice. The other three were classic NY, and really executed well.   The place was pretty empty for a Friday night, so I hope the work gets out about this place! There are lots of tables, so next time we will stay there to eat to maintain the crispy crust. This would be a fantastic quick lunch spot too - don't forget to sprinkle some garlic salt on, just like they do in NYC!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, low prices, fast, all in a spacious and pleasant atmosphere. The pizza is loaded with fresh ingredients, and the NYC-style slices are huge. I love the crisp but chewy crust. Lots of vegetarian options too. I've been here half a dozen times since they opened and the quality is consistently excellent. I'm shocked that it has been pretty empty when I've come in. Far-West-siders, get with it. This place far exceeds other pizza places in the neighborhood, in every way!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever experience in my life. Pizza came literally cold. Not even remotely luke warm. When I called the lady says, \"what can I say?, When pizza gets delivered it's usually cold. If you'd like you can bring it back and I'll throw it in the microwave for you.\"  They then required me to bring it back to get a refund. Unbelievable. Will never ever give them my business again."}
{"text":"Pizza Di Roma used to be my preferred drunken after-bar pizza by the slice joint back when I was a college kid downtown. That was...several...years ago, and as a west-sider, I've been disappointed with my pizza options. Yes there are the nice lovely brick oven Neapolitan style places but being an east coast transplant, I have a soft spot for a big floppy-but-crunchy NY-style slice. And now they have a west side location!  This past Saturday my wife and I were dropping off a package at the UPS Store, and as we headed up Grand Canyon Dr, we noticed there was a banner on the building that used to be Legends Sports Bar: Pizza Di Roma, Open Now! We had other things we were doing that afternoon but I went back later in the day to pick up a pizza.   Delivery service and liquor license were still in progress as of Sat 6/24/17 but they said they should have those along with a real sign instead of a little banner soon. The space inside is all remodeled with an open kitchen and pizza counter somewhat like the downtown location, with the menu written on chalk boards above. You can get a slice, order a whole pie (their sizes are S = 14\", M = 18\", L = 20\"), and they have a bunch of pastas and sandwiches as well. The big central bar from what used to be Legends is still there.    I grew up in Maryland, which is obviously not New York, but there are a bunch of NY-style pizza/pasta type joints there which are un-fussy, with good pizza and pasta. I grew up going to places like this and they're exactly why I get so irritated when a midwest Italian restaurant adds a bunch of dairy to dishes it shouldn't be in, and none of them have the NY style pizza crust.   The pizza is about the closest to a real NY-style giant floppy-but-crunchy slice as you're likely to get in Madison. I've had better NY-style slices, even in Maryland, but it's still pretty good and definitely scratches the itch for me. For reference, my personal favorite pizza in all of Madison is Salvatore's Tomato Pies, but neither of their locations is on the west side, and it isn't strictly NY style (it's Trenton NJ style). Pizza Di Roma isn't as chef-y as Salvatore's but also not as expensive, and you also have the option of east coast mom-n-pop red sauce joint pasta dishes, another thing which is sorely lacking on the west side of town.    So overall, Pizza Di Roma having a west side location makes me very happy, but now I need to be careful and avoid too many carb-a-paloozas. It was easy to avoid that when there weren't any places that scratched my NY (east coast?) style pizza/pasta joint itch."}
{"text":"Yes! I'm officially addicted to this pizza. Honestly, the only good New York style pizza in Madison. I'm originally from New Jersey (yes, I am aware that is *not* New York) so I've missed a good thin crust.  So far, the eggplant pizza is my favorite. I mean, I've liked all the ones I had. I think the ratio of the ingredients is good.  I ordered a salad yesterday to pretend like I was being healthy in addition to the giant slice of pizza I was going to consume. They give a good amount of salad! The feta in the Mediterranean salad is super yummy, though on the salty side.  I went there again today, after ordering delivery yesterday. I don't plan on going tomorrow, but we will see."}
