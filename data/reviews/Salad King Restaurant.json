{"text":"3.5 stars - lost .5 star for lack authentically tasting Thai food, but still good!!

Salad king - also known as the \"Ryerson cafeteria\". Best deal around for Thai food. Good meal under $10. 

There are more authentic restaurants around but part of the reason why we come here is simply to hang out with a group of friends and it's a central location for everyone to come to. We're not fans of the \"other Thai restaurant\" down the street. 

My go to dishes: spring rolls to start at every meal, then I either get the classic pad Thai, Thai Islamic noodles, Pattaya chicken or the red curry. I've had pretty much everything on the menu over the years, but those are my faves. 

I have had friend brave enough to do 20 chilli in their curry. It did not go well - upset stomach for a few hours after. Just stick to 10 and under. Don't be a hero. Lol!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to coming here for quite a while as I've heard really good things about the food here. I got 3 chillies for my food, but it was disappointing... There wasn't much flavour and it was really, really loud. Hard to hold a conversation here."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Best Thai food in downtown toronto."}
{"text":"I ordered something curry buy it was too watery so I ended up eating my friends dish Islamic noodles, their secret item not found in the menu. it was really good. Must try"}
{"text":"Been here quite often due to the convenient location. Everytime I come here someone in the group would order phud thai. This is the most inconsistent  restaurant I've been to. I decided to take a gamble and order the phud thai again after my last visit destroyed me with the extremely bland phud thai they served. Today it was horrible, borderline disgustingly sour. So just be warned if your last visit was good... It might not be the same the next time."}
{"text":"I have fond memories of this place when I was a student at Ryerson. I do have to say I believe my memories clouded the actual experience at Salad King since I've grown up so to speak. The pad thai was decent, but definitely not as good as I remembered! The curry was good too but I felt like I've had richer tasting curries before. It did it job though, fast relatively cheap and to the point. Great for take-out or a quick lunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"For years, my friends have been raving about salad king, but to be honest with you...I really don't know what the big hype is about..

I went around lunch time w/a friend a few Saturdays ago, and surprisingly..it wasn't that busy...

Decor - Pretty nice setup..and beautiful decor all around

Service - Though it wasn't busy, we had to call our waiter a number of times just for him to refill our water..most of the waiters were busy chatting with one another...
also, i found it quite amusing how one of the managers..well, i'm pretty sure he was one of the managers...looked so lost when he was trying to figure out which table ordered a soda..he probably took a good 3 minutes walking around clueless after he found out it was my table...haha

Miniature Shrimp Rolls - 2/5 - when they say mini..they mean really mean mini...don't get me wrong..they are yummy, but i really don't think it's worth $4.50

Sea Queen - 3/5 - Very good portion and not expensive..HOWEVER...it was nothing special...i had it with 5 chili's ..and my mouth was on fire

 

All in all, i wouldn't go back again..."}
{"text":"I love Salad King!  It was my go-to when I was at Ryerson and I will still go out of my way to go there now.  I don't care if it's not exactly 'real Thai', it is delicious!  I always get the spicy tofu or the golden tofu and I have never been dissapointed.  Staff are really friendly too."}
{"text":"The restaurant is always usually very crowded on weekend evenings, and quite possibly every day! 

The tables are very long, so people have to sit side by side, very close to one another. I find this kind of annoying as there isn't much privacy, but what can I do. I just suck it up. Along the back, by the big windows, are more private tables and seats. I think there are a longer line ups for those areas, as many people want privacy as well. 

When you are seated, your table mat, which is also your menu greets you. As you can see, the restaurant's menu is very long, but that's probably only because it is on one piece of paper rather than the book that we are more used to.

Personally, we love eating curry, fried rice, and their seafood dishes here. Every time I tried their noodles, I had some difficulty finishing it because it was't up to par with the other dishes.

Aside from the menu, you can modify the spiciness to your dish to make it as spicy or non-spicy as you like it to be. In addition to the chilis, you can ask your food to be made gluten-free or vegetarian depending on whether the option is available. Look for the appropriate images beside the menu to see if it's available.

Spicy Mussels:
This is one of our favourite seafood dishes. We added 10 chilis to it, which made our waitress raise her eyebrow. :D For us, it was quite spicy, giving our noses a little kick, but it was bearable. Aside from the spice, the dish was full of basic vegetables (onions, carrots, peppers) and the muscles were cooked well. The sauce itself was spicy and sweet... that's all I kind of remember about the dish. Eaten with the rice, it was enjoyable, especially for its price.

Panang curry:
This is by far my favourite dish in the restaurant. Golden in colour, the curry is perfect with a bowl of rice. I added a few more chilis to make it a total of 5, and it was perfect for me. The coconut milk that they used in the curry balanced out the spiciness, making it not spicy at all for our tastes. I like panang curry over the other types of curry because it has a bit of every taste in it. Spicy, sweet, and savoury all at the same time... I get all my favourite flavours in one bowl! I've tried many Thai curries from various restaurants, but for some reason, this one at Salad King still remains on my top 5 list. That says a lot!

If you're looking for a cheap but well tasting Thai restaurant in the area, try Salad King! Make sure to call ahead to make a reservation if you don't want to wait and/or want a private table."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend told me we were going to \"Salad King\", I expected a salad restaurant. What I experienced was much, much better. You have to head up a flight of stairs to the second floor to get to this little hole-in-the-wall, but the climb is worth it. 

It's a very open, clean, and spacious layout here. All of the tables are metal, and the paper menus also double as placemats. You can select the spicyness of your meal via the amount of chilis you have added to your meal. You can apparently go up to 20. I don't want to know what happens if you select 20.

Food wise, imagine McDonald's speed, yet relatively good quality. I was susprirsed how quickly our food arrived betwee ordering, and it being placed down on our table. My boyfriend got their Penang curry soup with white rice, and I got their spicy chicken (standard 2 chili sauce) with white rice. It came served in a very liquidy red sauce, and I was skeptical that it would be good; I was wrong! I cleared my whole plate, and left very full, and very happy. 

If you're in the mood for some fast Thai food, check this place out. If you want a more relaxed sit-down experience, you may want to go elsewhere. This isn't the kind of place where you sit down and chat with friends for an hour and a half; you sit down, order your food, demolish it, and head out."}
{"text":"Don't walk - RUN.  You have to go.  Amazing authentic tasting food, very generously portioned for sharing and great value.  Very casual, dining hall style seating.  Friendly, efficient and fast service.  If you're hungry you won't be waiting long at all.  My new favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto - and I've been searching for so long.  Very conveniently located on Yonge subway line, just a short walk from College or Dundas (Eaton Centre).  You could pay a lot more for mediocre Thai, but WHY??  Take out available also."}
{"text":"good food and reasonable price. I ordered panang curry with shrimp. It had a lot of shrimps that tasted yummy and the curry was great. 
I ordered the chicken lemon grass soup but not very impressed by that. wouldn't order it next time. 

And I really hope they could have STICKY RICE with curry. authentic thai curry should go with sticky rice!"}
{"text":"Salad King is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto, perhaps even the world. I'm so glad they've finally reopened. Delicious food, low prices (not fast-food-low but not too far off either), fast service, what more could a guy ask for? 

The food is just as good as it always has been. Perhaps the portions were a bit smaller but still fair sized. When I went the place was packed with a line-up of about 10 people waiting but when I left the line-up was all the way down the stairs. 

Skip the cliché Pad Thai, you can get that anywhere. I personally have three favourite dishes at Salad King. Golden Tofu Curry which is so good I once ordered it twice in the same day, Siam Noodle with chicken and extra broccoli (peanut sauce goodness), and Thai Islamic Noodle which you won't find on the menu but feel free to order it if you like chicken, shrimp, and broccoli in coconut red curry sauce on noodles. 

I used to go to Salad King way back in the day when they were still at their old location before they renovated and expanded. When there was no table service, you'd order at the counter and they'd give you a number and call it out when your food was ready. The numbers were never in order and I could rarely understand them when they were called out over a makeshift PA system. Does anyone else remember those days?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I should lower my expectations or if I'm being overly critical of the \"New Salad King\".  I've been a customer since the days it was a tiny, dark hole-in-the-wall eatery (before the first renovation at the recently burned down historical building on Gould St.).  A good friend of mine knows the owner and it was one of our favourite Thai food places for a bite.  The reason they had one of the busiest and best reputation for years was they actually had cooks from Thailand and he used the most expensive flour for his spring rolls (ever wonder why they weren't greasy and dripping in oil like other places serving spring rolls?).  The flour was extremely light and didn't hold much oil when fried and it made them crispy.  I was eager to try the new place.  The first time I stopped by and the line up was out the door and down the stairs spilling onto the street (it was about 2 weeks after re-opening at the new location) so we decided to eat elsewhere and come back another day.  The second attempt a few weeks later was successful as there was no lineup at prime time.  That may have been a mixed blessing... perhaps others shared the same experience as I did?

The service: We were seated immediately but after 10 minutes, no wait staff or anyone to even take our order.  This was not good as the old staff were excellent, very attentive, fast, courteous and easy on the eyes (at least the females were for me).  We were seated right near the door and wait staff had to pass by us to get to the kitchen (several did but we didn't know who was our server).  I was ready to get up and leave when a server asked us if we needed something... I said with a hint of sarcasm \"water would be nice and someone to take our order.\"  She was polite and said she wasn't our server and he should be here any moment.  She brings us a glass of water and he finally showed up a minute later.  He was not apologetic, quite blunt and looked like he was doing us a favour to take our order (ah, typical mainlander... being Chinese I can say that).  The food took forever to arrive... the old place was 5-10 minutes tops and this was closer to 15-20 minutes.  I was wondering if they forgotten our order? They could have at least brought the spring roll appetizers first.  Nothing.  We had finished our water and not even a refill.  In my head, the tip was dropping by the minute.

The food: After about 20 minutes, our food finally arrives.  My friend order phad thai and I ordered mango chicken on rice.  I'm not sure if they still employ the same Thai cooks but the first thing I noticed was the spring rolls were a bit more oily than I recall at the old location... perhaps it's my memory that is failing me since it took them a while to re-open.  My mango chicken tasted good, portions were as I remembered and medium spice done right just like the good old days :)  At least that part didn't disappoint.  While eating, my friend and I chatted about the operation noticing there was more seating and there were empty spots which was rare at the old place.  Our delay in getting our meals may have been the kitchen staff not being able to cook as fast to accommodate the larger seating capacity.  We also noticed some guy, who looked like he was in charge, standing around and the owner was absent which was rare (did he sell out or did he actually take time off??).  Not sure but I'll need to come back to test these theories.

The verdict: I would usually give them a 4-5 star rating but my return here was a tad disappointing so a 3 star outing this time.  They have made improvements in the size, seating and fancier decor but I feel they sacrificed service and quality resulting from their expansion.  The prices went up a bit too (about a dollar a dish) which didn't make a huge difference but it makes you think about value compared to the old place.  I'll definitely come back and we'll chat with the owner (if he's still here) and give him some feedback about our experience.  If there is no lineups, I would think something is missing from their previous success formula.  Will be back for a review update here."}
{"text":"Just walked out.

Have eaten their food lots, but now it is just not worth the snotty service. It's outsized popularity doesn't match its reality. 

At 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon in a half empty cavernous and super noisy restaurant:

\"Can we have a booth ?\" (two of us)
\"Umm like no - cuz umm booths are like totally reserved for parties of three or more, OK?\"

Ya.. Not eating here. Best of luck."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried 20 chillies, you haven't lived! This is one of my favourite restaurants in the world! Like others, I'm not crazy about the seating arrangements, but if you get a booth, you score big! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"It very much feels like dining at a fancy school cafeteria; it's very loud and crowded. BUT, the food is great. I've never had a bad meal there. And if you just get a water, chances are your bill is going to be under $10."}
{"text":"Good food, good price.  The cafeteria-style dining room is fun, but it can get quite loud!"}
{"text":"It usually is okay but today it was worse than normal. The service was always a bit slow but it's understandable when it's busy. When I went for lunch today, there was barely anyone there yet my waitress was so terrible. She was never there whenever we needed something so we had to ask another waitress to help us, which she was annoyed by too. Not only was the service terrible, the food was not great. Isn't it suppose to be better when it's not busy? Later on when we didn't tip her as much, she started being rude and saying we should've just done take out instead and sighed everytime she came by asking us for more money... lol worst waitress

avoid getting waitered by a white female, a little on the chubby side with dirty blonde hair."}
{"text":"This is one of the greatest restaurants I have gone in Canada. Tried their golden beef curry and this weirdly named Islamic noodles with Sapporo. Food is reasonably priced and extremely tasty here! One can go there every week!"}
{"text":"i enjoyed the stir fried noodles and rice best. it's just really packed during lunch and dinner hours which makes you feel rushed to eat faster. service was ... okay... only saw my server twice throughout the dinner which was when we ordered and payed our bills."}
{"text":"Here is the question I pose to Salad King: do you use canned mushrooms in your dishes because you don't take any pride in your cooking, or is it because you don't respect our intelligence?

Canned corn as well. And frozen peas. Is it really too much to ask for fresh vegetables?

There are literally dozens of other Asian restaurants on the Yonge strip that are able to pass this meager benchmark of competency. Avoid the lazy cuisine of Salad King and try one of them instead."}
{"text":"Salad King is a great place for a quick and spicy curry or soup. It's ideal for lunch.

These people know spiciness at this place. I like spicy food--very spicy--and the chili rating makes it very easy to pinpoint the level you like. 

I can recommend the panang curry and the tom hai gain as being perfectly decent--though nothing is really outstanding. Avoid the green papaya salad: it's entirely lacking in substance, with just some sad papaya and tomatoes.

EDIT:
This place seems to be slowly sliding downhill. The food quality is increasingly mediocre, and every time I go I'm a little less impressed than the last."}
{"text":"Ever since they've renovated, Salad King is disgusting now. The food is always watered down and flavorless."}
{"text":"This place is truly overrated. Ryerson students favourite this place, but the quality and taste of food has truly descended over the past couple of years. The chicken skewers appetizer is usually a safe pick, though."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a few people.  While looking for the place, i walked by it maybe 3 times because it was a tiny location.

Once i got there, i noticed it was like a giant upscale school cafeteria.  It was very loud and the people sitting beside me were obnoxious,

We were a group of six and everyone ordered something different.

I had the spring rolls first:  these were good with the dipping sauce
my main was the Siam noodles: first off my order got lost, so while everyone else at the table had their food and were eating, i still had to wait.  My order didn't arrive until most of my party were half way done. 
The food itself was really good.  It was a mix of peanut and coconut sauce-yummy.  The portion was a good size too. (i ended packing up some of it as i was the last one eating)

would i go here again, maybe."}
{"text":"For the price and the food, i think it's pretty decent. It's not something you hangout and chat for a long time because the acoustic is quite bad and there is usually a line at dinner time. 

There are a few vegetarian options, and the server made sure she asked if fish sauce is ok, which was much appreciated!"}
{"text":"I have never been let down here. I have been having the Thai Basil Noodle for years. I just came back to it after being away for 10 months and it was fantastically tasty. Caution: it's spicy even with no added chilli. 

The cafeteria side of the restaurant can get quite noisy, so keep that in mind if you're going on a date or you're with someone to have a good chat. You'll have to talk loudly! There is the separated seating on the other side which you might want to request instead."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much a staple in the Yonge & Dundas area.  I've never been disappointed with the food, service is fast (this is really and in-and-out type of place) and a MUCH, MUCH better option than Spring Rolls on Dundas. 
Love their curries and more recently had their vegetarian Kari Noodles - delicious but I went too aggressive on the spiciness. I think I chose 2 or 3 chilies  - the description was \"thai medium\" - so I was downing water like mad. 
The new space is vibrant and just as hustling & bustling like the old one. 
The seats have a basket underneath so you can tuck away your belongings - how clever."}
{"text":"Lucky for me and my partner, we went right before the mad after work rush. The food was good, but I don't get the hype. The phad thai noodles was a bit too starchy, I think they should run it under a little bit of water. There was a fair quantity of shrimp in the phad thai. One more thing was that I found the spiciness a bit inconsistant. I ordered a mild and medium dish, but the mild was hotter than the medium. I will return once in a while."}
{"text":"Good, but overrated.

This restaurant offers pretty good thai, but it isn't the best available.  The line up for this place is crazy.  This cafeteria-style restaurant has some smart design - you don't have to put your jacket or bags on the floor because there's a storage basket under your seat. 

They offer you the option of adding however many hot chili's you'd like to your dish (up to 20!).  I have had their spring rolls, green curry and their hot thai noodles.  They're a lot more filling than you'd expect, so bring your appetite.  The noodles are quite heavy, but I'm sure you'll be hungry after waiting an hour in line for their food.  They're accomodating.  It's affordable, with prices between $4- $10 for appetizers in the $10 range for dinner.  For its value, the food is quite good.  It's a bit loud, so if you come with a big group, expect to be screaming to your friend across the other side of the table."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The first time my friend took me here, though, I had a better experience than the second time. The first time was a definite 5 star, and the second a 3 star, so here we are!
The food is overall, great. It is really reasonably priced -- as long as you don't over-order. The first time I went I had the chicken soup and shared the spring rolls with my friend and everything was super delicious (5 stars!). The second time I went, I ordered the large thai beer and it was huge -- way too much beer, and my boyfriend ordered the basil beef on top of the soups and spring rolls to share and it was way too much food (not to mention not that great in itself). 
But, all in all, the food is really great and extremely inexpensive for what you get. A definite recommend!"}
{"text":"Very busy place, for good reason. Their food is fresh, cheap and flavourful and you can tell them how spicy you'd like it to be. And they can do it really spicy. 

Please note, they are closed on Sundays. 

Also try Linda, their upstairs restaurant. They have a slightly different menu, but just as good but a way more relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Good location for Asian food when you are in the Dundas Square, Eaton Center, Ryerson U area.  This is a place to have a quick and inexpensive bite, not a place to hang around, as they do not expect you to sit there for too long or have a private conversation - the seats can be uncomfortable and you do not want to join the conversation of the guests at the tables around you.  Reasonable range of choices and options to increase or decrease the spicy level.  If you want to dine out and you are on budget, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Great food! 
You should try the `Seafood Fried Rice` and the crispy spring roll, it is really good.
The environment is too loud and they quickly clear out your plates, so you kinda have to leave after eating instead of spending some time to catch up with your friends."}
{"text":"Salad King serves cheap bad Thai food. I've tried the green and red curries and both have been 'Americanized' and taste nothing like the way they should. Both have too much coconut cream to the point that they actually taste sweet. The ingredients aren't really Thai either. At $9 for the curries it is pretty cheap which is probably the only real thing which it has going for it."}
{"text":"Ok so I know Salad King is like thee place for students in the area etc and their Phud thai or Pad thai or whatever is not half bad. The price can't be beat and all that.  I get it. So for those students brandishing their chopsticks ready to gouge my eyes out over this review i do sincerely apologize.  I am only writing this negative review about one thing. 

I FRIKIN LOVE TOM KHA GAI SOUP. you need to know that first. 

So rewind to yesterday where I have caught myself a nasty cold right? sore throat, coughing, sneezing all that unpleasant stuff and let me tell you it was a miserable night walking home in the wind downtown last night. Am I right? 

So anyway I get home and decide \"damn man I really want me some sweet coconut and chicken soup right now! It will just really be damn good for my throat and all that\" So i get excited and bring up some thai restaurants. Now my favs for some reason on the delivery service sites don't offer Tom Kha gai. (whats up with that guys? afraid your soup will spill? Do what kenzo ramen does. put the soup in a bag then in a container!! who knew!!??) So then i happen upon Salad King. Thinking hey their foods pretty good and cheap. Lets go with that. 

So I ordered a healthy dose of Tom Kha gai, like two so i could make one giant bowl of soup and some pad thai for good gluttonous measure. 

So i waited the allotted time and it came. Super excited now and coughing up a storm. 

So here's the thing. When i get out the soup i notice ok weird its got a weird like orange dark watery look to it. Not the usual beautiful white creamy coconut magic look where you just want to dive in and bathe in its boiling hot goodness (even tho you would probably burn to death and that wouldn't be good for you at all) 

So then I start stirring right? and what do i see to my surprise. BUT LETTUCE. so I'm like what the?  thats weird I have never seen lettuce in this soup before. Is this like a, we're mad at you for ordering from a service instead of coming to our restaurant deal? Is it like payback?  So i take a taste... IT TASTES LIKE LETTUCE!!! 

WHO THE @#*$ PUTS LETTUCE IN TOM KHA GAI SOUP!!!??? 

(to any cultural recipes that actually put lettuce in tom kha gai i am so sorry for insulting or questioning your cultural choices)  

Come on Salad King!!??? LETTUCE??? IN COCONUT CHICKEN MUSHROOM SOUP??? it was gross and soggy and just plain disgusting. 

I cried 

I did! I really cried. I was so sad and disappointed. So moral of the story. When you are thinking of choosing Salad king for your Tom Khai Gai needs. DON'T They put friggin lettuce in their Tom Kha Gai. 

But I gave them two extra stars for their amazing Phud Thai! and their tofu, man i love the way they do their Tofu. BUT LETTUCE?? COME ON GUYS!! 

also.  say Tom Kha Gai as many times as you want. Go on try it. its fun. Say it over and over. I know you want to

cheers"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken satay and phud Thai ! 
Chicken satay with peanut sauce was good !
Phud Thai wasn't so great. I did not like the taste."}
{"text":"Get the islamic Thai noodles - so good!  Cafeteria style seating but delicious food and good price."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck if you're craving thai food. For what you pay, you get a huge portion and is a  great alternative to some of the other \"cheap eats\" downtown. The communal style eating makes it pretty fun too!"}
{"text":"It's alright. I remember it being better at their old location before it was burned down. I feel the portions have gone down in size and so has the quality unfortunately."}
{"text":"great cheap thai food w/ large portions, note there is usually a wait and the bench seating not so comfortable."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! However, be sure to avoid the Thai milkshake...it's an abomination. What's great is that they offer a variety of spiciness levels so you can judge yourself how you would like the dish to be.

Update: Be careful with the optional spiciness level. It is not consistent with different chefs. Also, I brought a foodie friend that said the spiciness is from a synthetic food additive. Now, I can't tell the difference, but what's interesting is that when you ask them to give you the spicy flavouring on the side, they refuse."}
{"text":"This place is amazing value for dollar! Plates are usually share-able (a girlfriend and I can share a pad thai and a mango salad). Service is great despite their being busy almost all the time. The food is amazing, even the takeout. The only downside is sitting quite close to strangers when they're full. Overall, I love it and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is an old fave since I was introduced to it a couple of years ago and went with some trepidation since the name doesn't sound like fab cuisine, does it?

I was so wrong. It really is a great little place. Nice ambience, kinda like a busy cafe more than a restaurant. Contemporary/abstract bright decor and lighting. Always busy and buzzing. And a separate section for take out that functions with military precision (they don't want your details, just give them your order and they give you a reference number that you use to pick up the order. Separate payment area so don't have to hover over diners. We've done quite a bit of take out here, and a few dine ins.)

As a vegetarian, I found it awesome that the menu has a whole veggie section. The spice level is customized to you. You need to choose the number of chillies. As someone who can seriously handle spice, I would recommend going beyond a 4 or 5 (though they do have it on offer).

I've had the golden tofu, very, very nice. A Masaman kind of curry with peanuts and coconut milk. The spicy tofu wasn't a great hit with me... decent flavours but it relied too much on red and green peppers which I hate. Plus we took that one away; it really got quite soggy and unremarkable when I ate. I've tried a few of the salads; again, didn't love them because when modified to veggie, they seem to lose their punch. And last, I've tried the Islamic noodles, which is on their 'secret' menu. That is awesome. Think Pad Thai, with red curry over the top. Yum. I asked for a tofu one, which I got charged extra for, which confuses me. Why would that cost more that a chicken version?! 

They are child friendly and offer high chairs. My daughter loves the fried rice with breaded shrimp.

Reservations aren't easy on the day, but they usually can accommodate a few walk ins if you're happy to wait a bit.

All in all, they do a contemporary take on Thai very well, and we keep going back. 

I've been there with several meat eating companions that all seemed to enjoy their orders. So I'm taking a leap of faith in saying they do that very well too."}
{"text":"this use to be good before it burned down but now there are better choices for thai. Look at other popular restaurants in Toronto and you'll find better options"}
{"text":"When I first came to Canada 4 years ago everyone raved about Salad King and how wonderful the food was. I tried it but didn't find it at all satisfying. I tried it again recently thinking that my pallet would be more refined and I could appreciate the food everyone seemed to love. Had the beef golden curry - not the best i've ever had and not something I would come back for. Other than that everything else was mediocre, the new remodel didn't wow me and seems a bit out of place but I liked that they thought about baskets under the chairs for peoples belongings. Not that the place was terrible, but it wouldn't be a thought in my mind to consider for next time."}
{"text":"I used to eat here 5-8 times a month because its fast and tasty.  I do wish they used less oil though so if you're watching your weight, this is not ideal for you. Also do not go less than an hour before closing, ESPECIALLY on a Sunday or you will be met with terrible service and down right rude wait staff.  Even if I go 1.5 hours before closing I will face the same result almost suredly if it is a Sunday.  They will take your food before you are finished without even asking, put up chairs at tables around you, put the bill down when you are still eating and avoid eye contact to signal they want to go home. This has happened to me about 3 times a good 45 minutes before close even when there were still 20 people left in the restaurant.  I have been a server before and I would be far too embarassed to do any of these things.  Maybe the new manager will improve this.
I have also found a shrimp in my food once, which as a vegetarian was pretty disturbing.  Instead of comping my meal I was offered a new dish but was told I would have to wait (implying by the time my dish was prepared my friend's food would be cold if they chose to wait).  In short, food is usually good, but service can at times be sloppy depending on your server."}
{"text":"This is a great sport for a date, business meeting (although it may be a bit too loud), or just picking up a meal for yourself. I always get my food quickly, the staff are extremely attentive, Good a meal that won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"Been here quite frequently. Service and food has been very consistent: courteous, prompt and attentive. My go-to is the secret menu item: the Islamic Noodle (Chicken) with 3 chilis. The only negative thing is when it is really busy, it kind of feels like a cafeteria and is hard to hear your friends, even those who are seated right next to you. Even with this, it would be unfair for me not to give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to Salad King.  We used to frequent the old location on daily basis - it was my go-to for great Thai food. 

The new location is great and definitely bigger compared to the original location.  Food quality seems to have changed a little bit and the portions sizes have gotten a little smaller.  Nonetheless the food is good and prices are reasonable.  Just beware the noise level, hard to carry a conversation without having to yell."}
{"text":"one of the cooler atmosphere and good tasting restaurants. still do not understand why it's called the salad king but the Thai food is good. especially the mango desert sticky rice. the seating is similar to a canteen but the cleanliness reminds me of hk mall restaurants"}
{"text":"The sequel! The new place looks fantastic, all bright colours and fun. I'm slightly concerned that my green curry was lacking in flavour, but bites of pad thai and golden curry were nice. All dishes were suspiciously low in meats...  I'll need to go back for a closer inspection! 

As for people saying its more expensive, come on, its still a cheap meal, and think about food prices now versus 2 years ago!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at the Salad Kind new location, been at their other old location many years ago.  I was not impressed with their food in the past but they have improved a whole lot since they moved to their current location.  Went there for lunch during a weekday for 12noon and the place was packed by 12:30pm.  Suggest you go right at 12pm or after 1:30pm if you want a seat.  Really hard to have a conversation because the place is loud with the crowd.  Had their veggie pad thai noodles and it was so good!  Everything about the dish was just right!  The following week, I did a take out of the same item but it wasn't as good.  Better to sit in and order.  The food tastes a lot better.  Can't wait to treat my sister here for lunch.  Restaurant was clean and the Staff are really nice and the service was very good."}
{"text":"My nostalgia for this place from when I was a Ryerson student might contribute to my warm feelings for Salad King, but I really do find the food to be pretty good. It's not the absolute best Thai food in the city, but it's tasty, filling and cheap. Mains are under $10 and the portions are huge. Unless you're a really big eater you could even save half for lunch the next day. It's quite casual and, yes, noisy.
My favourite dishes are the panang curry, hot chicken with cashew, pattaya chicken and of course the pad thai.
The level of spice is made on a per-meal basis, so if you're a relative spice wimp like me, medium will do. The most I ever had was one chili. Friends of mine who like their food hot usually go for 3 chilis, sometimes 5 at the absolute most. Anything past 5 chilis is just crazy, even though it goes up to 20."}
{"text":"Oh God yes! This is where it's at with Thai food.

If you go to Ryerson, you're up the creek with no paddle when it comes to decent food in the neighborhood. It's essentially street meat or Salad King.
I'm not big on actually eating there, cause it has a sort of cafeteria vibe where everyone shares these long tables to eat. Cute if you want a fast lunch, but not exactly what I want for a dinner date.

The take out bar is the best. Amazing veggie options and everything comes with huge chilies. It's like a flavor explosion in your mouth on every bite.

The chili system goes from 1-10 for hotness, 10 being unbelievably hot. No really, you will pay if you get ten, but it will still be the most flavorful meal you ever have.

Sometimes I crave the curry after a night out so bad, I'd do almost anything for it.
That good."}
{"text":"Make sure you get there early or you will have to wait in line - the good thing , the line moves quickly. 

Its a cheap alternative but quality isn't great.  - I would jog over to the Bloor Street MArket and just get a salad there, even if the selection is limited."}
{"text":"Salad King is one my favourite spots in the Yonge-Dundas/Ryerson area.  It's cheap, it's delicious, and the portions are HUGE.  I always order the Bangkok Stir Fry (mild or medium), but would also recommend the Islamic noodles - you won't be disappointed.

My one complaint is regarding the service from my last visit.  I ordered the Bangkok Stir Fry; however, I was brought the Chicken Phud Thai instead.  Rather than exchanging my dish, my server showed me that he had written down Pad Thai and left the table without an apology. While I enjoyed Salad King's Pad Thai, I was really looking forward to one of my regular dishes. 

Despite this setback, I don't think I could ever stop coming to this resto.  STAY AWESOME Salad King."}
{"text":"It's way too loud and busy to eat in so I always get takeout.  Their Siam Noodles are wicked, but I always get the Penang Chicken Curry with rice and peanut sauce.  I love a hot and spicy meal so I get 7 chilis but I think they'll go all the way up to 15 which I wouldn't suggest!  The Manager is an ass but the rest of the staff are really friendly and always remember repeat customers.  Make sure to remember your frequent diner card (Chili lovers card?) as you can't combine multiple cards."}
{"text":"Came back here for the first time since my last review. Food is great, price is low, service is good. Yes it is loud and can be cramped, but I have not yet found a thai place that can deliver adequate service and tasty thai food at this price point, and at such a convenient location."}
{"text":"I missed this place especially when they were closed since the building collapsing/fire incident.  I find if you want cheap and good food this is the place to go.  I have brought people from out of town at this place and they are love it. 

The only complaint I have is there spice-level. It seems to vary from time to time I go there and I always order a 3. The heat can reach up to a 5 at times (I know this because I used to order a 5) whenever I order a 3 and it just ruins the experience.  

I usually order Golden Chicken curry and its damn good. Other Thai places doesn't do justice to this place especially for prices and portion. 

It does get insanely busy and the service isn't consistent. That still doesn't deter me from going here."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style restaurant, but I do like their new location and decor which is definitely a step up from their old spot. It's a great place for Ryerson students to hang out, although the food is definitely inconsistent - sometimes very greasy or very spicy, even when you choose the same chili/heat rating."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to. We were looking for a Thai restaurant on Yelp and saw that Salad King got 3.5 stars out of 5, which made us think this can't be a bad place. So we decided to go there for lunch and omggg that was a big mistake!!! We ordered the basic Thai dish: mango salad, tom yum soup & pad thai. I swear I can cook better than this at home. It's not only nothing close to Thai food but also terrible, like we never had such a bad experience like this. I think they just threw all the stuff together and call it Thai food :-S"}
{"text":"Not very authentic thai for me, it feels more of a fusion. But husband seems to love it. So I'd say give it a try."}
{"text":"the food is so not authentic. if you like real thai food you should try khao san road. WAY WAY WAY WAY better. The service is not good either. DO NOT GO HERE. I can buy microwave dinner better"}
{"text":"I get take out from Salad King at least once a week and they have never let me down!  It's just up the street from where I work, and a great alternative to the Eaton Centre food courts.  The place is super busy, so it's a good idea to call your order in ahead, or you may have to wait 15-20 minutes for your food.  They have a great selection, including curries, stir fries, fried rice, soup, salad, spring rolls, and many vegetarian options.  There are options for the most cautious palate, as well as some for more adventurous eaters, and you can specify how hot and spicy you want your food.  Some of my regular choices are Shrimp Panang (delicious peanut sauce), Green Curry Shrimp, Seafood Fried Rice, and Spicy Tofu.  All are good, depending on my mood, and all are between about $8.50 and $10.00.  I have never eaten in there, but I imagine that due to the crowds, the service is probably no nonsense, efficient, but by no means relaxing!"}
{"text":"This place is not as good as original salad king. But the value is definitely there. So far my favourite dish is Siam noodles. 

The place is generally busy but you will always can find a spot. If you are hungry , order noodle dish. The portions are very generous.

Enjoy !"}
{"text":"Simply the best! Due to the ubiquity of Thai restaurants in the Toronto downtown area, this was a hard choice to make. It all came down to where you could get the best of the simplest dish - Thai fried rice, and Salad king won out in this regards. Décor is simple and clean at salad king if you decide to eat in and the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, tasty Thai with lots of choices! Loved by locals and visitors alike.

I had the chicken panang, which was delicious. As a party of one, I was seated immediately, but those with larger parties should be prepared for a longer wait."}
{"text":"very full most of the time. The seats are like cafeteria style thus youre forced to eat next to strangers. Food is excellent though. THey need more locations! If you get the default dish with 2 spices, you cant reduce it to one spice which is unfortunate. The water they use in their glasses taste like bleach."}
{"text":"Unfortunately,  the quality and service of food here has gone downhill dramatically. Came here a couple times before and always ordered the same thing - chicken Phud Thai. This time I came and ordered it but it came back far too Sour. When I kindly asked for a replacement the waiter said sure. He proceeded to talk to the manager and she came back saying that they can't replace it but instead offered to pack it up and give extra peanuts.... She also said the recipe hasn't changed in 25 years and was adamant on the fact that the chef makes it the exact same every single time. Extremely rude and said that my taste buds changed. Will not come again."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute classic--cheap food, large portions, fast service.  It's always been kind of student-y and that hasn't changed since the reno, but the food is still the same speedy Thai food that Salad King has always been known for."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of the best Thai places in the city.  They have raised the prices lately, bit it's still fairly reasonable and the place is always packed, so I guess it's still worth it.  Panang Curry is great here and the Siam Noodles have a wonderfully massive amount of extremely delicious peanut sauce on them.  Beef Satay is also a favourite.

Only negatives are that it's often very loud inside (due to the busyness and a solid ceiling) and you may be seated at a cafeteria style table if you have a small party (but that never bothered me).  The waits can also get a bit long and they don't take reservations for dinner."}
{"text":"this place is far too noisy, and the service isn't the greatest. But if you're looking for cheap eats that are also quite delicious, I would check it out. I tried the pad thai (which i think was spelled pud thai here), as well as the peanut beef skewers"}
{"text":"Some of the dishes are a hit or miss. Not a fan of the phud thai; the noodles were soaking in sauce. The garlic shrimp was okay, the shrimp was nicely breaded and fried but the sauce was meh. It was a very Japanese inspired dish. I liked the bangkok stir fry noodles, definitely would reorder those. Overall a good value for your money."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with one of the best bang for your buck places. Food is delicious and quality is consistent every time I go. It's one of my favourite go-to places when I'm downtown because it's food court prices and the quantity is plenty!"}
{"text":"True Salad King is busy, but that is no reason to keep yourself away. The food is so good and so cheap that I have no problem with a small wait or a large crowd. 

I have been to Salad King many of times now and I have never been disappointed with the quality or taste of their food. I can't get enough. You are able to choose how spicy (8 level of 'chillies') you want your meal to be with the majority of dishes. I hear a lot of people complaining about the long, shared tables and seating, but that is one of the greatest things I love about Salad King. Why is everyone afraid of other people? I love sitting so close to complete strangers. I have had the pleasure of even making new friends over lunch because of it. Isolation is boring, community is fun! 

The noise is high but not outrageous. I would suggest you make your visit one with friends rather than a first date. There are many better places for a romantic evening, but few for a fun, lighthearted time.


PROS:
Great food - tasty and fresh, awesome experience, making new friends. 

CONS:
can be busy during rush times."}
{"text":"Good and well priced. I do prefer them long ago before the renovation, but it is much nicer now. 

As always, I've loved having the # of chili options. Being a lover of spicy food, it is really nice to be able to really control the spicy level."}
{"text":"Went here because it had rave reviews on some blog about the best food in TO.

We both got the pad thai (I know, so boring) and it just left a lot to be desired. The noodles were bland and whole dish was just lacking in flavor. So odd.

Also, the noodles seemed to be cooked in water and then thrown together in the dish as opposed to stir fried, which I found odd. 

The space and service were both nice, just stay away from the noodle dishes."}
{"text":"This place is excellent all around. Food is alright. 

Pro
-great selection
-loylty stamp card
-very fair prices



Cons
-always busy
-feels like a student joint"}
{"text":"Good thai food, quick and at a reasonable price, what else needs to be said?

Oh, one more thing, they have a stamp card, do get that."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want spicy thai food. They have a legend with a range of different spice levels you can choose from to customize your dish. Some dishes are already a bit spicy on their own, so you can also just ask for no additional spice. I usually only order medium (the least spicy option on the legend) and find that it still has a kick in my wimpy mouth. 

Their curries are deliciously flavoured but a bit thin and don't have a lot in them (usually after a few spoonfuls, the meat and vegetables run out and I am left with just a lot of sauce). I also don't think the quality of the meat is very high. However, the price is very affordable and I would prefer to come here over a food court.

I hate the seating here because of the bench style (no back on the seats) and difficulty storing your jacket while you eat. They have metal baskets under the benches, so you could roll up your coat and put it in, but this is difficult with winter coats or nice coats you don't want to jam into a tight space. The only other option is to just hold your coat in your lap. Probably the worst seating arrangements I've experienced in a restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is good, but nothing to rave about. It is a very reliable meal that you know will leave you satisfied and likely with leftovers for the next day!

On my visits I have had both the Islamic Noodles and the Siam Noodles. The Siam Noodles are great however after ordering the Islamic Noodles once, I don't think I will ever go back. Be warned that this \"secret menu\" item is not too pretty, but the sauce has such a complex combination of flavours that you will be left wanting more. If you have leftovers make sure to take them as the noodles taste great, maybe even better, when they are cold.

Although it is nothing out of this world, the food is well priced and tasty. If you are in the Eaton Centre area head over to Salad King instead of the generic food court stalls and taste something more unique to the city of Toronto!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants to go to when I was a Ryerson student. Definitely go there for the food, not the ambiance. I went there a couple of weeks ago, and it was very noisy and has a rather awkward seating arrangement."}
{"text":"Food is rather disappointing - the soup was far to salty, the papaya salad without any dressing or other ingredients!?
I returned it. Would not go there again."}
{"text":"I came here once and was quite satisfied! I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai (with 10 chilis), which was pretty decent. I like their idea of the spicy scale, having a choice of 1,3,5,10,15, and 20 chilis put into your dish.

The service was pretty fast, and the staff were friendly. The food pricing is also affordable, having most or all choices under $10.

I would love to return and try out a 15 chilis dish next time!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has the reputation it does.  The place is loud and crowded and the cafeteria/mess-hall layout doesn't lend itself for a relaxing meal with a friend.  The service is lacking as well.  To end on a positive note, the food is fairly decent and well-priced (albeit bland)."}
{"text":"Haven't gone back since the univ days. Went back recently.... Got the pad thai with 10 chilies. Yum.. Brought back those memories of the univ days. Maybe next time I'll scale it down to 5 chilies... Didn't Rem it being this hot... Maybe it's age... :) 

Glad this place is still serving up some fantastic thai food!  Will be back soon..."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and there was alot of people and the food seemed to be good. I was very disappointed at the food. We ordered some stir fried rice noodles and a seafood combination plate and both lacked good flavour and not one of the better thai places around downtown"}
{"text":"I recently visited their new location and the food is still tasty. The set-up is kind of tight and the volume is very loud so you either are forced to overhear conversations of parties seated next to you or to speak up so that your dinner companion can hear what you are saying. Good place if you are going on a date but do not wish to have awkward silence when you run out of things to say if there are no sparks or connection!

I am a big fan of their food. I've had their seafood tom yum noodle soup and their chicken mushroom tum yum soup - both were delicious.  The pad thai looks pretty good as well as the other vegetable/chicken spicy rainbow dish that my friend ordered. I have yet to try their other dishes to see if they are the same as what i can remember from back in the day at the old location.

The food is fresh and everything comes out piping hot. The tom yum is as authentic as I can make out. 

The service is fast and the food comes out fresh & piping hot.  With the amount of turnover, the food is always fresh.

My usual favorite is green chicken curry but I didn't get a chance to try this out yet. I also have yet to taste the pad thai. 

Prices are reasonable. Dishes are around $7-8. They also serve you water but they take awhile to refill your cup & stop refilling after they see you've finished your food.

Overall this place is reliable and de-li-cious. I find it better than spring rolls and East on Queen."}
{"text":"Many a time I've heard these famous last words from my boyfriend: \"Here, try this, it's not that hot\" and the next thing I know I'm waking up on the floor in front of the refrigerator, soaked from having poured milk all over my face and mouth to try and quell the burn. 

Okay, so that's a bit of an exaggeration, but let's just say I have something of an extremely temperature sensitive tongue. So I was terrified when we walked into Salad King and all the servers were wearing T-shirts proclaiming \"HOT!!!\" and the whole place was done up with suns and fire symbols. Still, I decided to be a fair sport and give it a go. 

The fish sauce was a bit bland, but the crispy spring rolls we got for an appetizer were very good. For a main course I ordered the pineapple chicken (mild, obviously) and I actually wish I had maybe gone a step-up to medium. The flavor was great and all the ingredients were fresh. My boyfriend ordered a 5 chili tofu dish and tried not to act too ego-hurt when the girl next to him ordered 10 and lapped it down without batting an eye. 

The place has a school cafeteria feel (long stainless steel tables and slatted benches to sit) and is every bit as loud. The service is a bit slow, but for as busy as it gets, it's really not that bad. I've definitely had worse in places with far less traffic, so I can't complain too much. 

The best part has to be the price. Our appetizer, two mains and a pot of green tea (despite my thinking that should be complimentary everywhere...) only came to $24 (with tip)."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. Every dish that I would order would be a symphony of flavours that hit every tastebud on my tongue. 

Those days are over. The papaya and mango salads are disgraceful, bland and missing the appropriate number of ingredients. The pad thai is a sorry excuse for a noodle dish. Thai Express puts more effort into their dishes than this place. 

The next time you're craving thai, I would sooner suggest the Eaton Centre food court than this place of year's past glory."}
{"text":"the Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


The Salad King serves \"Asian fusion\" cuisine, which is code that means if you've never really had good Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, or Korean food you should find their food satisfactory. It's a fast food joint that has the decor of one of the nearby condos. Think: lighting by Ikea.

I find it amusing that people get excited about these places. It's basically a Taco Bell for Pad Thai and Chicken on Rice. There's little flavour, little passion, and little care as they churn out Pad Thai with Chicken ($10) Pad Thai with Shrimp ($10) or Pad Thai with Both! ($10) to a new batch of Condo owners and University students every year. There's some variety in the spiciness of the dishes, but it's nothing you can't simulate at home with some Tabasco sauce or chili pepper flakes.

If you a want a fast plate of food and a hip atmosphere, come here and chat with your buddies before you hit the AMC for the latest Vin Diesel picture. If you want tasty Asian food with some authenticity and complex flavour, put the King in check, and go to one of the 50 better restaurants Toronto offers up.

I offer 3 stars instead of 2 because the prices are reasonable.

3 stars"}
{"text":"While there is a lot of good going on at Salad King I was disappointed by the food. Great atmosphere,fast service, polite staff and cheap prices. But the chicken cashew dish I ordered was drowned in a watery sauce and the chicken was chewy with no flavor. My girlfriend ordered a mango dish that tasted a lot better. This was the second time I had gone here and not enjoyed what I ordered.  I guess its hit or miss. Overall, its alright, but I wont be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you!  It's actually a Thai restaurant and not a Salad Bar or vegetarian restaurant.  Located on the second floor so it may be a little difficult to spot.  It is a busy place though so be prepared for a wait.  The food is generally decent and pricing is about average.  Certainly not the best Thai food in the area but decent enough if you're in the area and craving."}
{"text":"Decent food and speed of service. But there is a racist mural on the wall that mocks stereotypes of the way Chinese people speak English (pronouncing l instead of r, for example). That's unacceptable and loses my business."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful but the food (or at least the spicy beef) is meh.

I was so excited when I got to the restaurant. I read so many good reviews so I thought to give it a try. 

I ordered the spicy beef.
The beef and the veggies were over cooked and tasted soggy. There was only a little hint of spice in the dish.

I'm disappointed for wasting $11 (taxes and a pop included in the price) on this place. I should have stuck with Wiki Hut and order my usual wiki chicken and mango salad."}
{"text":"I would eat here regularly when I was a student... I have other go-to thai places now, but once in a while I still crave Salad King and just must have a curry there... or perhaps, it is the student spirit that I suddenly miss?"}
{"text":"Salad King is the perfect place to eat delicious food at a good price. That being said, Salad King is NOT a place for lounging or quiet conversation.

The only 'downside' to Salad King is its atmosphere if you don't know what to expect. There are very few individual tables - most of the seating is composed of long metal tables that span the width of the restaurant. As a result, you and your party end up sitting elbow-to-elbow with strangers (and I do mean elbow-to-elbow - Salad King is always busy). 

The food is consistently good, and you can choose the number of chilies (/spice-level) to add to your meal. Though the scale goes all the way to 20, 4 chilies add a good amount of kick without hijacking the flavour of your food. The spicy mussels are my go-to dish, though the curries are also very tasty.

The wait staff is fast and efficient, like a well-oiled machine. 

Salad King was one of my favourite spots to grab lunch while living on-campus at Ryerson, and definitely merits a visit. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Favourite place to go for lunch near Ryerson University. Their pad thai is great. You can choose the hotness level, which you should be careful with it can get super spicy. They have  take-out option as well which is nice. They have a vegetarian/ vegan option."}
{"text":"I tried the Islamic noodles as suggested. It was awesome!

Not a good place for an intimate conversation or deep debates, unless you want to be yelling over the other people crammed in with you!

Great food! Fast service! Polite server :)"}
{"text":"salad king is dropping their A-game and its probably because they get so many customers that they just don't care anymore... I used to be a regular at this place and my favs were the Islamic noodles (ordered off the menu which means its not there but you can ask for it) basically pad thai drenched in curry).. and golden chicken curry and their fried rice.. but the most recent time I went there I was so underwhelmed that I probably wont be returning here..first of all, when my husband and I walked in and saw A LOT of seats free near the windows, the lady who was seating us wouldn't let us sit there.. instead we were in their cramped interior sitting side by side with others.. second of all, the food that was served to us although it was served fast, it was super COLD.. the curry was good as it is always but the Islamic noodles was too sweet even though I had asked for 3 chillies.. and I just couldn't get myself to enjoy it because it was so COLD.. and the rice was probably one of the worst dishes I have ever had here.. the peas in the rice were not cooked well and tasted like the peas you would eat straight out of a frozen bag of peas.. step up your game salad king!"}
{"text":"Sure, it's fast and inexpensive. But that doesn't mean it's good.

I was craving Thai food on Saturday at about 6 p.m. I realize that this place is buzzing with activity, but I would still appreciate some genuine service. My server never spoke more than three words at a time to me.

Foodwise, I left unsatisfied. My shrimp pad thai was a good-sized portion, but no amount of lime juice could bring the right zest back into these lacklustre noodles.

And as a matter of personal taste, I prefer standard seating as opposed to Salad King's communal tables, although I did like hearing the adjacent couple discussing such topics as, \"Well, would you prefer that we were engaged?\"

I left briskly and don't expect to return anytime soon.

$10 for an order of pad thai, including taxes."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they were Ryersons best kept secret and at their original location. I take everyone I \"really\" like here.  They make excellent affordable dishes and they are always packed! The service is very friendly and efficient and portions are generous"}
{"text":"Service wasn't the greatest- but you can't really expect much from this cafeteria-style, heavily-Ryerson-encroached eatery. 

What the most disturbing part was, when I opened the door for the washroom (mind you, washrooms are right beside their kitchen....) I wasn't greeted by a washroom attendant -no- but instead, a very perky and very happy cockroach. Heeeeyyyyyyy. I (audibly) yelped, and then (mentally) planned to Yelp, and then scurried the hell out of there. 

Was surprised by the manager's response- as all he replied was, \"Ohhh... shoot. Sorry about that.\" and turned away to continue tending to another diner. 

Sorry what?

There's a half-beaten, half-alive c o c k r o a c h -who can very well survive a nuclear BOMB- sitting in your lavatory, and you're just going to let it have a late check out? If this is how the Salad 'King' treat their people, I do not want to stay in his Kingdom.

And my Lime Leaf Chicken was soggy noname chicken segments drowning in a sloppy red shit soup. It tasted spicy and sad."}
{"text":"I like Salad King as a staple fast food before the movies.   I had the mango salad and the pad thai.   The pad thai was good as usual but the mango salad was not worth ordering again.  I would still use it as a fast food staple before the movies."}
{"text":"Trust me!  Don't go there............ the food is disgusting ( I found a couple of cubic hairs inside my curry dish) and the service is unbelievable bad especially the manager watch out for his attitude.......... the only upside is the price ( that's why I gave them 1 star) so PLEASE STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the options and spice level that you can choose. Servers are nice and the interior design was well done! 

Try and order the Islamic Noodles, hidden gem and not on the menu!"}
{"text":"I adore salad king. It's fast. It's frikkin delicious. It's reasonably priced. Did I mention that it's delicious? And they can make everything spicy enough that it hurts me, which is hard to attain and a constant goal for me.

I especially love the golden curry with tofu - I eat meat, but sometimes a girl just needs some soy product swimming in rich yellow sauce. I also adore the bangkok stirfry, which is less saucy but full of vegetables, chicken, and shrimp - one order feeds me for two meals. The cold rolls are sort of run of the mill, but they're cold rolls, so there's only so much you can do with them, I suppose.

I'm not super fussed on the cafeteria style dining set up, so I usually get take away, but there are times that the loud, communal eating set up has its own appeal. It's sort of nice to get lost in the noise, but only very occasionally. If I can score a seat in the front window, I can watch the world go by while I munch.

Also, the hours don't thrill me. They close at 9 most nights, which is often exactly when I'm thinking about eating. And they're closed entirely on Sundays. Who even does that anymore?"}
{"text":"I almost dare say I wish this was a chain restaurant.  As far as price and quality goes you can't go wrong with this place.  Love the busy atmosphere and if you're in the mood for some quick Thai, it's perfect. Favorite has to be the green curry chicken with a 3 chili hotness level.  Also, the new location is quite impressive."}
{"text":"Salad King is six stars.  This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto and probably anywhere.  I love it because it has terrific food at a good price.  We cannot get enough of their phad Thai, green curry and Islamic noodles.  We don't get anything else because these items are so dang good.

The Salad King recipe for phad Thai is simply the best I've ever had anywhere period.  As one of the owners Ernest once said to me when we told him we were moving to New York City: \"New York, they put ketchup in their phad thai.  Yuck!\"  And you know what, he was pretty much right.  Most phad Thai dishes in Canada and the United States are sweeter with a red, ketchupy flavor.  Yuck!  At the Salad King, there is no hint of this ... a clear sauce that is flavorful and really pops when you squeeze lime all over the dish.  Truly, the lime is a key flavor for this dish so don't skip it.

They make their own curry base from scratch ... I've had Linda explain it to me in the past, not that I understood most of it and she probably didn't want me to anyway.  :)  When you go to 99% of Thai places, they use a commercial base they get from a food distributor.  It can still be good, but it explains why the food at the Salad King really is a step above.

I will say other items like fried spring rolls and chicken cashew are not my thing.  They don't have those deep flavors like those other dishes.  You can't be exceptional at everything -- but Salad King is actually exceptional in the phad Thai sauce and curry department.  Eat them often, eat them now."}
{"text":"This place was a let down. I had the spicy tofu and it was made with canned mushrooms and the other vegetables were cooked to the point they were mushy. 

Prices were good but overall the food was very low quality."}
{"text":"Salad King.. ya I used to enjoy this place...

BUT NAHHHHHHH!!!

The service was really bad - the waiter didnt accommodate for vegetarians and he was whack real talk. 

I ordered the country tofu and it was swampy and not even illest. 

I had a bad tummy too and jt wasnt cuz of da spicez. 

Looks like this place is a no no from now on!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable.  This place is not even close to ready to open.  I walked the 15 min hike to Salad King for takeout today, walked up the stairs to the restaurant.  Place was really busy with a long line on people waiting for a seat.  I walked up to the take out counter.  The lady said \"Take Out?  I can't do it. We are too busy.\"   What?  It's 12:10pm.  I had people calling at 10:30am for takeout.  We are too busy.  

What a joke...  No food for me. NO STARS for you."}
{"text":"Came here twice and ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and Green Mango Salad both times; they're both pretty good. Food came pretty fast both times (under 10 minutes) and the portions are great!

Service is great too, I was greeted by smiling and friendly waitresses both times. 

I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food in the city. Always busy, cafeteria style eating so don't expect privacy or quiet, good prices. My go tos are hot Thai noodles, green curry chicken, hot and sour mushroom soup, mango salad, spring rolls but everything I've tried I liked. There is a spicy scale, I love my food spicy and I get 3 or 5 chilies depending on my mood. Expect your food to come when it's ready not everyone's meals at the same time. Wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"I truly do not understand the popularity of this restaurant.
I love Thai food, and I find the food, in general, is not very flavourful here.
There is so many other amazing options in town.
I would not choose to come eat here unless a friend really wanted to come here (which is what happened)."}
{"text":"I came on a Thursday evening where the restaurant was packed and had a line-up. I had ordered the Sea Queen which consisted of tasty breaded calamari and rice. The sauce was really tasty so I'd definitely recommend this dish. Presentation was a bit on the messy side and you can tell the meal was rushed and the rice was pretty much cold. But, other than that, the calamari was full of flavor!"}
{"text":"For the longest while I thought this was a salad bar, which is why I never bothered to check it out.  Came here with a few Yelpers to grab a bit before an event, and was impressed.  We waited no time at all for a table, and the service was very quick.  I ordered a chicken vegetable yellow curry, and it was nice.  I don't know that it was the best I have ever had, but I can't complain at all.  The great thing about dining with fellow Yelpers is that no one gets annoyed when you insist on taking pics on your food before eating.  :)  Great service, and good food goes a long way with me!"}
{"text":"Went there once and nothing really stood out to me...I've heard good reviews about it from friends, but it's just not what they've described. Good if you are looking for a convenient average meal near Eaton Centre. Seating arrangement was weird and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"went there for a late lunch on a sunday afternoon.

we had the beef satay, thai basil noodle, and chicken basil rice.

satay and the noodles were ok. but the chicken basil rice was pretty bad. 

The sauce was way too watery, and it just tasted like everything was watered down. On top of that, that was no basil flavor at all. 

Don't think i'll be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Salad King is one of those places where you can go and get a very fresh meal quickly without any hassle.  The food is cheaper than going to the mall just south of its location and offers (in my opinion) a better selection of balanced meals.

The clientele that frequent this place are generally students, and considering its proximity to the Ryerson campus, this is no surprise to anybody.  It's often very busy so if you're a party of more than 2, expect to wait for a table during peak times.

The environment is often very loud so if you're looking for even a moderately quiet place to sit and talk, this is not going to be it.  And while it appears very hectic, the wait staff are very well organized and take good care of you.

Did I mention the food?  The food's great."}
{"text":"I love the orange chicken. Customer service experience was poor. But food wise I prefer the orange chicken than the basil chicken. It is pricey but it's not bad."}
{"text":"Salad King is as noisy and crowded as a high school cafeteria. Literally you will be sat on communal benches awkwardly close to strangers and have to yell across the table for your friend to be able to hear you. A good first date spot this is not!!

But what counts, the food, happens to be tasty and reasonably priced. They are also excellent to vegetarians. I've had the bangkok stir fry, kari noodles and golden tofu - good portion sizes and served HOT out of the wok. My bf always gets the Thai Islamic noodles (Pad Thai noodles in a creamy coconut curry sauce) which are not on the menu but everyone seems to know about and love."}
{"text":"The Thai Islamic Noodles are great as are both the noodle soups and the green curry. Go for 5 chilies, it's nice and spicy!"}
{"text":"Meh. Overpriced place everyone at Ryerson loves to eat. Their pad thai is dismal, and people go there mainly to satisfy some kind of spice addiction."}
{"text":"5 of my co-workers and I visited Salad King for lunch on a Friday. The service was great and the food was delicious. The decor is beautiful now, and the seating (benches) has baskets built right in for your coat or purse. 

I have one complaint that makes me not want to go back though. The NOISE. I couldn't hear my co-worker across the table from me, let alone any of my other co-workers. We were pretty much screaming the whole time. There's got to be a way to place sound absorbing panels in the ceiling. If you can handle this though, it's well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great place! Portions are big, food is delicious. Incredibly laid back vibe. I had the pad Thai on two occasions and it was quite tasty and cooked well."}
{"text":"I always find myself coming back to Salad King. The location definitely blown me away - it was MASSIVE, who knew they had such a large space in the heart of downtown Toronto. I love to stick to the stuff I love and that always leads me to order Pad Thai when I'm here and it never fails me. The portions are definitely big and you should consider sharing a dish with someone if you have a tiny stomach like me.

Beautiful location. Great service. Reasonably (and cheap) priced. I'll be back...FOR SURE."}
{"text":"Great price and food! Love the panang curry with 3 chilis... Not too spicy, but just enough for me"}
{"text":"Used to be super awesome when it was tiny.
The food remained awesome as they renovated.
Then they moved and became swanky.
The cafeteria layout just wasn't working, but clearly the food was good nuff to keep us coming!"}
{"text":"It's a little tricky to find but its quite nice inside. It seats a lot of people and is cafeteria style-looking. Super busy, and super fast - the energy inside is almost overwhleming.

The food is okay. I was disapointed with the tastes, flavours and quality of food because the prices aren't cheap. The entrees are priced just like any other higher end Thai place which makes it really frustrating to eat poorer quality of food here and pay their prices.

If i had nowhere else to go and was craving food - i think i would make it myself before returning here."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend who recommended it. Not the best Thai I've had, tofu was pretty soggy. I'm not sure if I got food poisoning or what, but I threw it all up the next day... 
The decor was fun, but I doubt I will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Was here recently and this place has gone downhill . The curry was lacking and the rice wasn't even properly cooked. No wonder they no longer have long line ups during lunch ."}
{"text":"This is a solid cheap food option in the Yonge and Dundas area. Nothing fancy, the dishes are standard but the atmosphere is typically lively (you can sit at communal tables or general seating) and your food comes fast. Dishes are good quality for the price, good portions and I'm always satisfied."}
{"text":"I loved the Pad Thai. But I'm a bit biased with that food. I like it pretty much everywhere. 

The mango chicken dish was disappointing though. Cooking mango does not taste good. You're better off consuming it cold in a drink, or straight from the fridge. 

The service was okay. My server had a funny tone to her voice, and walked away after I inquired about the unlisted Islamic Noodles (Pad Thai with curry sauce drenched over it, according to her). She brought the food out fast though, so props for that.

In summary, this place isn't that great, but it isn't bad. Good to go to if you're in the area, but not worth travelling a far distance just to get there."}
{"text":"Good, not the best servers (some are really cute though) I would give it a 4 and a half but will give it a five to make up for some of the lame people on here. Those giving it bad votes because of the atmosphere- who the f goes to eat good food for the atmosphere?? No wonder crappy chain restaurants (Chili's, Applebee's) get business with you sheep going there for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here frequently since University. A big fan of their Siam Noodles and Seafood fried rice. Came here today to tried these two dishes and very disappointed... The fried rice are all stick together as blocks of white rice, they took away the mussels and leaving only squids which are very hard and uncooked. Siam noodles portion are so much smaller than before, also having a weird taste like unfresh ingredients! Very very disappointed and this experience ruined my good impression of this restaurant! Never coming back and nor recommending for anyone!"}
{"text":"Went around 7PM on a weekday and the place was packed and loud. Didn't expect 5 chilis (on their spiciness scale out of 20) to be that spicy (since I'm accustomed to spicy food), but I was surprised. The portions are large and they have some beer tower thing so that you don't have to wait on the servers to get you more beer. Overall, the food was decent but the place was really loud but I guess that's to be expected."}
{"text":"Salad King provides a comfortable ambiance and the food is pretty decent. I've found I've had better (and cheaper) pad thai just down the street at another small establishment. The curry was also good. Unfortunately, the server wasn't very attentive and I couldn't even get his attention to refill my glass. Since we are seated alongside and across from other strangers, they noticed, but couldn't help lol"}
{"text":"Kudos to this affordable, generously portioned restaurant or shall I say, cafeteria style restaurant serving thai food. I highly doubt this is anything close to authentic but hey if you are hungry and you don't want to break your bank then this is the place for you. I tried green curry which has not much to write about but, gotta say the secret menu item was indeed very good! I forgot the name of the dish now, oh wait it wasn't on the menu either. The portion is very generous and unless you are a real hungry beast you can get the leftover packed to go for lunch the day after."}
{"text":"My 2 stars is NOT the food - it is the hostess without the mostest - Jenni. 
People who are contradictory in their ridiculous seating policy should understand that plus or minus 4 or plus or minus 6 should be easily accommodated when a reasonable explanation is being offered. Seating some and not others - and imposing your policy that your door greeter can't get right ... gimme a break!

Things to say to make things better:
\"I understand your frustration\"
\"I apologize for the misunderstanding\"
\"Thanks for your patience\"

Food is great and will probably bring me back - but I hope to be greeted by other staff."}
{"text":"I was about to give 5 stars until I tasted the coconut ice cream.  It was very disappointing to the point that I asked our server if she was sure it was coconut.  The rest of the food was amazing.  The place was packed right up to closing which is a testament to how great it is.  Service was excellent too, on this busy night."}
{"text":"Ok, so i voted this place 3 stars, if I had wrote this review about a year and a half ago, it would be 4 stars no problem.. The prices are extremely reasonable, their portions are quite large, however, they have shrunk from when i'd eat there over a year ago. Flavour is pretty good, just wish the meat quality was better. All that being said, this place is great for when you're really hungry and craving some cheap thai food.."}
{"text":"Inconsistent. Sometimes it's great, other times not so great.

The one dish that never waivers is the Penang Curry. Solid every time. 

Don't bother ordering the Mango Salad. It's dressed with only bottled lemon juice. No signs of chili or fish sauce :( I mean, would it kill someone to squeeze a fresh lime. 

The Pad Thai is just okay. I wish they would use Thai Chili instead of Chili Flakes for heat in this dish. 

Sea Queen is a favourite. Breaded Calamari with a Sweet/Sour/Spicy dipping sauce. 

I was excited for the Sticky Rice/Mango dessert. Totally unsuccessful as the mango wasn't ripe. This should be a seasonal item, and shouldn't be featured on the menu when mango isn't in season."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh delish food. The staff are so friendly and knowledged about their menu."}
{"text":"Interesting dining room, average service, terrible food.

Heard some good things about here, I was craving for Thai noodles that I had last November at Bangkok. Thus I decided to give it a try. Got the Thai Basil Noodle, the shrimp quality was terrible, tasted blend yet salty and to make it worst its extremely oily. The real Thai food isn't just a plate of starch with lots of oil and saltiness. 

Thai iced tea was terrible.....
Go across the street and try Basil Box - they make the best in town - exactly like how it should taste it/what I had everyday in Bangkok."}
{"text":"Would give negative stars if i could. Service was absolutely disgusting. Both hostess and the manager are extremely rude. Aggressively yelling at customers with racist remarks."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of salad king for over 10 years now, ever since their old location on Gould Street. Their seafood fried rice is by far my favourite, and they have just recently removed the mussel topping on it (which I usually request for them to remove anyway), so it works even better for me personally. They also give a generous amount of squids (10+) and shrimps (about 4 pieces) on their seafood fried rice, which I think is a pretty good deal for a tasty $10.25 dish.

They are very fast and efficient with takeouts. Their stamp card is a plus (buy 10 get one free) but they'd usually refuse to stamp multiple cards during group dinners (although some time, depending on your waiter/waitress, you can get a few stamped at the same time). They are often inconsistent with their chili measurement, so some days your dish may be much or less spicy than another (I like my dish spicy, but not deadly, so I think five chilis is usually a safe bet for me). Their \"less oil\" is also still quite oily, but I don't expect anyone to visit Salad King while they're trying to eat healthy on the first place - the \"Salad\" part of their name is definitely misleading. :)

Anyway, overall, I love this place! Everything more or less tastes pretty great and they're affordable!"}
{"text":"This place is always crowded on the weekends, but they always find a way to squeeze you in one of the long tables where you sit beside other people.

I have tried a lot of things in their menu but the golden curry and the thai basil noodles are my two favourite dishes. To anyone who is planning on coming here for first, I would recommend them to try any of these two items!!

** Just be careful with the chillies, depending on how much love spicy food anything more than 3 could make you become a dragon."}
{"text":"TLDR ; not the same level as Pai/Khao San Road in terms of quality, but still very good for the price and portion size.

I've been here a few times now and tried a few dishes. #1 tip - order the Islamic noodles (their \"secret menu\" item). 

Their pad thai, green curry and thai fried rice are also good options for mains. I was quite disappointed by their khao soi though. I would go to Pai or Sukhothai or Khao San Road if you're looking for good khao soi.

If you are looking for a dessert that's not too sweet, give their mango sticky rice try. Salad King serves a decent sized portion compared to a lot of places.

Overall Salad King has great quality food and big portions for the amount that you pay. There is also lots of seating so even if there's a line, it moves quickly. The only complaint I have is that it's quite noisy so I wouldn't recommend if you want to have a conversation during your meal."}
{"text":"Meh. I used to like this place. But this is the second time in a row where I am totally disappointed with the food. The pad Thai was too sweet, the chicken hard and the tofu soggy. No peanuts, dry lime... it was mostly sweet noodles.

The beef basil had no basil at all. The veggies were overcooked and the sauce thin and tasteless. The beef again was dry and hard. After a small plate I wanted nothing more to do with it.

The place used to make me smile. This time it made me want to go home. My friend and I summarized our experience: bland, cafeteria food."}
{"text":"Salad King's new location is really cool. It's the same set-up as before, but now upstairs and bigger. They've got pretty awesome restrooms, too.

I've heard that it can get really, really busy at this place. I came early with a friend and there were still a handful of people coming constantly. Most of the business probably comes from the Ryerson University students.

The part that annoyed me the most when I was there was the service. It took forever for somebody to come and take our order, or even acknowledge us. At the time I came, the restaurant wasn't even half-full, so I didn't understand why it was taking so long. However, after the order was taken, our food came relatively fast. I ordered the Pad Thai, which was delicious. If you don't have a big appetite, then I suggest sharing entrees with someone. Not-so-great service, but a good place for a tasty meal."}
{"text":"Huge portions, very flavourful, great price. What more can you ask for? The only downside is that it gets really busy but that's what success looks like."}
{"text":"I like this place for cheap and quick thai food. I live pretty close, so it is convenient. I avoid coming here during lunch time and peak dinner times (the waits can be long then), and mostly come before or after the lunch or dinner rush (no wait), since I hate waiting, also the food here is not worth waiting for.

 I like how you can have your food mild to mind blowingly spicy, I love spicy foods but my husband doesn't so this place caters to our individualistic taste. All dishes are generous in size and the prices are very reasonable.  Do not expect to find the most authentic thai food here, but it is tasty so who cares, some times you don't need \"authentic\" thai to fulfill that craving. My favorite dishes here are Thai Street Noodle Soup and the Lime leaf Beef with 10chillis each.

The place is cafeteria style so can get quite noisy during the peak periods, service is casual and prompt which is good for this type of place."}
{"text":"Great for a quick meal when you want cheap Thai food.  Hot Thai Noodles are quite yummy and the chicken satay is also good.  My spouse loves the orange beef and mango salad.  This is not a romantic restaurant or a good destination for a special event, it is great for a fast meal.

It is also a good destination if you are with a group of people and there is a person who does not love Thai food.  The menu is diverse enough that they will find something they will like."}
{"text":"Good food, cheap prices, perfect location- what more can you ask for?

There are secret menu items- look them up for some cool dishes!"}
{"text":"Always fast service, delicious food and great decor.  I highly recommend the veggie pad thai with 5 chilis!"}
{"text":"Salad King. I love you. I know you are more \"fuzion\" than Thai, but I forgive you. Honestly, in my mind you could do no wrong.

A fresh to Toronto (and fresh faced) Jennifer of a decade ago, would frequent the small and no frills location on Gould, with Ryerson student card in hand for the 50% off deal (between 2 and 5pm) almost daily.  So many memories! Evil Jungle Prince, eating beside Ja-Rule, the time my girlfriend and I ordered 15 chilis and almost died. 

My heart broke a bit when they gentrified, cleaned up, went handheld devices and communal tables. It did. And my Salad King consumption declined as I graduated and moved on.

Coworker and I, hungry, wandering on Yonge, visited Salad King for dinner after post works drinks on a Thursday evening. Everything is shiny and modern, and I am happy to report, just as good as SK of yesteryear.

Bonus Points
- my adorable and friendly server was actually Thai. (fun right?) I got to practice my pathetic broken Thai phrases on her. 
- Thai Basil noodle 7 chilis is EXACTLY the same as it always was. Amazing.
- There were plenty of choices for my DC who does not really enjoy pan-asian cusine.
- Prices were fair. I had a meal, and took two to go for my jealous SO and friend, and my bill was $34. 
- Only Salad King gives me food as Spicy as I like it. 7 chilis was, and always has been, perfect.  

Minus Points
- I like tea
- No Chopsticks? what gives?
- I don't like sitting with newly dating university students fawning all over each other. 

So Happy to have you back. Long Live the King!"}
{"text":"I met up with one of my good friends after work last night for some good food before heading to the library to finish our final papers. We walk in and I'm already impressed by the unique décor. It looks like a school cafeteria, but for cooler kids. We're seated immediately and I look down to see the chili scale on the easy-on-the-eye paper menu. Having grown up eating spicy Korean food, and taking into consideration most restaurants really mean mild when they say extra spicy, I thought I could take on the 10 chillis. So that's what I initially ordered, until our waitress gave me the \"Ummm are you SURE?\" look, which totally chickened me out because she was Korean as well.  So I decided to tone it down a bit, and go for the 5 chillis. My friend still seemed pretty worried for me.

When the food came out (which was super fast considering it was really busy), the duo sitting next to us looked over at my dish before I even noticed and exclaimed \"Pretty!! Rice shaped like a pyramid!\" and then when one of them heard what I ordered he said \"I can't WAIT to see you try and eat that\". 

\"HOLY SMOKES!!\" was my reaction after my dinner at Salad King. \"Omggg my brain is on fire! Do they have milk? These guys aren't kidding!\" were just some of the words I uttered while bulldozing through my meal.  My friend got the Thai Fried Rice and I had the Panang Curry...................... with 5 chillis. Needless to say, the dish punished me pretty bad, I had a stomach ache after. But did I wake up craving it the next morning? HECK YEAH! 

I think the duo next to us got a real kick out of seeing me suffer through the meal. Again, our waitress was great because she kept coming over to fill my glass and ask me if I was okay haha. The food was pretty good but when something is that spicy, you don't really taste much after the first 2 bites. I decided I wanted to be a soldier and I finished everything, even had spoonfuls of the curry itself. I didn't even want to think while I was eating it because it was so spicy. But all in all, it was a lot of fun eating it and I was very full! By the time we got to the library I was k.o-ed and fell asleep for an hour hehe.

WARNING: These guys are SERIOUS about their spicy-scale! Don't even attempt anything over 3 chillis if you haven't been trained to handle heat!! I think I could get used to the 5-chillis, but the 20 chilis would most likely have me landing in the hospital. No joke. Dear Salad King, in terms of spicy level, hands down, \"respect\"."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Seafood fried rice + pad thai are soooooo GOOD. Food comes fast and always tastes delicious, very generous portions as well!!!!!"}
{"text":"Salad King Restaurant is a great place to bring a date for a low-budget night out."}
{"text":"I love Salad King.  I use to go here all the time when I lived downtown. The food was great and staff very friendly and attentive.  Lately, in the new location, I have noticed that the food is not as great as it use to be.  I am still giving it 4 stars though, with the hope that improvements are made and it goes back to its stellar past.  

This place is usually crowded with Ryerson students and workers in the busy yonge and dundas area.  In the evenings it gets crowded.  I love the panang chicken and the islamic noodles (not on the menu, but you can order them).  The spring rolls are great too.  Hopefully Linda can bring back the old charm."}
{"text":"SOO LOUD during lunch hour! I usually just order take out. And to echo others, not as good as it used to be..there are better Thai options around this area but I like to get the Islamic noodles every once in a while still (with 6 chillis!)"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just over it, or maybe I'm just hanging onto my nostalgic University-era days, but Salad King just doesn't seduce me the way it used to.

Don't get me wrong, their extremely well priced dishes are still great bang for your buck, and their late operating hours will also make for a good late night meal. The interiors are slick, and still have that magnetic Salad King-esque modernity to them.

But where they failed to win me this time around was their flavourless Panang curry. With all the great Thai options in the city, the King will have to make their food once again as dynamic as the decor to reign supreme in my books."}
{"text":"Good food. good location. good price. good service. 
Have been there many many times and would recommend to everyone. Try thai islamic noddles and seafood fried rice. My two all time faves."}
{"text":"I tried Rainbow Chicken and it was A-OK. I'm willing to go there again and try their curry and pad thai. Great vibe though."}
{"text":"Salad King is like the McDonald's of Thai Food in Toronto. It's in a super convenient spot, great for RU students to swing by and eat in a loud environment. Been here a few times solely out of convenience and having a quick bite before classes/exams.

Ordered Pad Thai on several occasions, and it's okay. It lacks real pad thai flavour. Tom yum soup - avoid unless you like having water with tom yum base and a small sad slice of a white button mushroom. Bangkok noodles are okay, siam noodles is meh and rainbow chicken wasn't that great, like eating seasoned chicken in water that was meant to be flavourful.

- Food: Inconsistent, but edible. Kind of \"meh.\"
- Service: Good. Servers are attentive, the rare occasion you might get the one who never shows up afterwards. You know... the one you gotta yell at or wave down.
- Price: Fair, bit pricey."}
{"text":"The food is really good, BUT it is SO insanely noisy there! The seating situation is really hard to get past. You get to sit immediately beside other people that you do not know, elbow to elbow. There is no room to put your coat. There is a little spot under your seat where you can put your bag, but there is no way a coat can fit there. Some people just tossed their coats on the floor. It was very busy when we went, which added further to the noisy atmosphere. 
We both really enjoyed our food, but honestly the noise and the lack of appropriate comfortable seating is what might deter me from returning."}
{"text":"The good:  very good thai food and generous serving size for real cheap.  one of the best thai food i've had in the area.  i would rate it with 5 stars based on that alone.

The bad:  the communal type set-up i'm not a big fan of.  it reminds me of a highschool cafeteria where the tables are set up like high school benches in the gym.  oh, and the uni-sex washroom disturbs me."}
{"text":"Good food, high school cafetaria mood, a bit cramped. Overall safe choice for Thai food"}
{"text":"Salad King, you are what you are - a low-cost, reasonably good pan-asian noodlery/ricery, that likes to have fun with the spice meter.  No more, no less.  You're very useful and we're all glad that you exist."}
{"text":"The food is pretty cheap, the servings are pretty big, and the service is pretty good.  I ordered something that was a bit spicy, brought this to the attention of my waiter, and then got a new (and much milder) dish in exchange.  This is a cool spot near the Yonge and Dundas square area of the city.  They are pretty busy and the seating is communal, like a trendy mess hall.  Overall, pretty good Thai food."}
{"text":"I used to be the biggest Salad King fan. I had their number on speed dial and would need to have Panang Curry at least once a month to keep my world from crashing. 

But ever since it's opened backed up, the Panang and a bunch of their other dishes just isn't the same. I'm assuming they've changed their chef... because the curries don't taste the same and overall it's just so disappointing. 

Don't get me wrong, Salad King still serves good food, but it is just no longer drool worthy enough for me to consistently come back every month."}
{"text":"I ordered food from the Salad King food truck as it was near my work, and not being a Toronto native, was unaware of the restaurants supposed long history. 15$ got me a cucumber salad and a green chicken curry with rice. Overall I found the food disappointing and rather tasteless. 9 dollars seems like large sum for a curry dish that is truthfully very cheap to make. The vegetables in the curry tasted horribly overcooked and there was very little chicken in it at all. There was lots of white rice though. The cucumber salad was alright, I mostly enjoyed it because I really like cucumber, basil and peanuts already, but aside from these ingredients there wasn't much else happening. At this point in time there are so many more flavorful options in Toronto for the same price point or less in this style of food that I'm puzzled as to how this place still stays in business. Truthfully, I feel i could have gotten the same experience from a frozen TV dinner."}
{"text":"Always my go to Thai place when I'm downtown! Can be easily missed since they have a tiny sign peaking out but it's right across from Ryerson University's new learning centre and in between Champs and Pizza Pizza. 

Service is always fast and often busy between lunch and dinner hours as expected. They also have really long tables with communal seats side by side so expect to sit next to strangers if you intend to go as a pair. Depending on the time of day, it can get quite loud but the food always hits the spot and leftover noodle stir fry's are my favourite; tastes even better the next day, mmm!

I love trying new things but I can never get myself to order outside of my go to dish which is their panang curry with chicken ($9) and Thai iced tea ($2.75)! The curry is so creamy and rich and pairs even better with their secret menu dish called Islamic noodles which I find myself craving often! Colourful interior, affordable and flavourful food. Definitely the place to be when you're in a hurry and want to eat something quick and go. Fast and friendly service and I guarantee you'll be stuffed!"}
{"text":"There are just so many much much better Thai places and the fraction of a dollar that I saved price wise at salad king was just not worth it. I had the chop suey, it is not their specialty as I soon found out."}
{"text":"Not just 5 for the ridiculous tasty green curry..  Or the Phud Thai that shames all my previous tries, ask for extra lime.  I did not try the Phud Thai Islamic of legend, everyone around you will. But 5 stars for the friendly competent staff from the door to table and back again. This restaurant came highly recommended from trusted friends and did not disappoint even after the ridiculous hype."}
{"text":"Their spring rolls and panang curry are decent but there is better thai food in the city. If you've got the time explore elsewhere."}
{"text":"Don't let the name of the restaurant mislead you, there are many other items than salad on the menu! 

My partner and I love this restaurant - we are regulars who often fill up our stamp card for free meals. It's just a great place to have a quick, inexpensive and flavourful meal. My favourite dish is the pattaya chicken - crispy fried, breaded chicken in delicious sweet lime sauce. The dish must be cooked just right however, I've gotten it soggy and cold a couple of times. I also have the green curry chicken from time to time - it is a perfect consistency and very tasty! The food is always served to you in lighting speed, which is great because there is often a line up of people waiting for a table. My favourite thing about this restaurant is that you can choose your own spice level. I usually go for 15-20 chillies... insane, right? I know, I'm addicted to spice. The servers are all really nice as well, I've never had a bad experience here.

My only complaint about this restaurant is the seating - it's quite busy and you often end up elbow to elbow with strangers sharing your table ~ a little loud and awkward at times. That being said, I would probably sit on someone's lap to eat here if I had to - the food is that good!

It is definitely worth trying this restaurant out and I have recommended it to many friends with great results. We took my partner's parents here when they visited from Ireland, and it was the only restaurant they requested to revisit during the week!"}
{"text":"Canadianized Thai food. The worst I had so far. I have to drink at lest 4 glasses of water after the meal and still thirsty."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I must say the hype is well just hype. other than the location, there aren't many outstanding characteristics that make this business stand out against the crowd.

The food:
I found that the food was good but nothing spectacular, and with the prices creeping its going to start losing group to other options around town. Their definition of spicy is fairly good as I usually get an order of 10 -15 chilies. =) 

I like that they have a diverse menu, but as my girlfriend and I found, the quality varies between good and half decent. They know how to make soup based curries especially with coconut milk, but their handling of stir fry based dishes left much of the food over cooked.

Overall 1.5 stars

The service:
Their wait staff is like their food, some are good some are decent. First time around we had a good server who was patient and kept an eye on our dining experience during a busy dinner rush (kudos to him). However, on the second visit, the server wasn't as attentive to the table leaving us waiting for service. 

Overall 1.5 stars 

Would come here again if I was in the mood for thai and unwilling to make my way to khao san road. Hype was unfortunately just hype.

+0.5 stars for the communal table design, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly. Place got a bit loud and not a huge fan of the cafeteria tables. Portions are big and were at a great price. 

Thai Fried Rice: Loved it.
Bangkok Stir Fry Noodles (veggie): Friend said it was good but the tofu needed more sauce. 
Green Mango Salad: Refreshing but difficult to eat because it was very thinly sliced. 

Expectations satisfied!"}
{"text":"This girl at the front that supposedly there to welcome guest... welcomes guest with a screw face like youre bothering her from her day dreaming.

There were three of us.. I got there first, told her theres 3 of us.. she then goes.. wait for your friends.. I asked.. I cant get a table.. girl says. nope wait for your friends.. then shs walks to the corner and started talking to her co worker looking at me.

Wow.. what an experience.."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely accommodating with my loud (and sometimes obnoxious) group. We kept on adding people to the table so everyone was a bit squished, but that's our fault really. Even then 12 people all fit comfortably on around 3 or 4 tables. 

Our server was very attentive, constantly refilling our water and attending to us promptly. They gave out free samples of beer, and they made sure to check ID too. Food arrived quickly, although for some reason mine arrived a good 5-10 minutes before everybody else's. I wasn't complaining though; I ordered the street noodle soup with 15 chilis, I needed to have the most time for the noodle to cool down. The green tea milkshake was delicious and heaven sent for my slightly-abused taste buds (I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy), although others would probably complain about it being too sweet. Actually, one friend of mine tried my soup and said it was disgusting, as the peppers completely overwhelmed any other potential flavour. I didn't really mind though, I rather liked it. To each their own, I suppose.

One problem: there wasn't a drinks menu, so I had to ask my server what type of drinks they had.

I am definitely going to bring my parents here sometime. It's an unique place, as opposed to traditional restaurants."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Good price. Good for dining or takeout. I eat here once every two weeks and their food is consistently good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch/dinner and the service has always been really fast. This time I got the Siam noodles with chicken and the peanut and coconut sauce it comes with is amazing! I always opt for mild heat but depending on your preference you can make it as hot as you would like. The serving sizes are also very generous here as I always end up taking some home for breakfast the next day. I will defiantly be coming back for dinner again!"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I've been to the new location.  The decor is very nice.  At the old location, I usually did take-out since the place is usually packed.  Since I've been out of school for a long time, I'm not use to sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers for a meal that isn't fast food or cafeteria. This of course means you cannot have a private conversation since people around you are \"part of the conversation\". 

It seems like the prices have gone up and the portion size is smaller.  I remember when it was cheap and large portions (the reason for being popular with students). Now the prices and portion size is comparable to other Thai places. 

For that reason, I wouldn't mind ordering take-out (3 stars). However for the same price, I'd rather eat at a place that has a better environment (2 stars)."}
{"text":"I've been to Salad King at least a handful of times before over a handful of years too. It was alright and economical the first time or two... Then after trying a few more items, I didn't find it special or anything at all. It's like Thai Express but in a fast casual setting. If you want authentic Thai, for sure go to Pai. Pai's been my fave since the first time I've been. If I wanted Thai food that's there I'd go.

Anyways for convenience sake and because one of the friends I'm meeting up with actually likes the place, I ended up at Salad King... This time I wanted some noodle dish and ordered the khao soi just to see how it is.... For $8.75+tax, you'd be very full from it. But I rather pay 5 bucks more and go to Pai....... The friend that likes Salad King says she only ever gets the Sea Queen (fried squid with rice) or the Pad Thai... So ya, if you ever have to eat here, maybe those are the best bets..."}
{"text":"While this is by no means a fine dining experience, Salad King definitely serves up some really great Thai food with fresh, quality ingredients, generous portions and a price that can't be beat! 

The Pad Thai is great, I adore the Mango Chicken and when I'm in the mood for curry, their green curry hits the spot. I hate the setup of the restaurant - the long benches are crowded and it's a bit awkward if you try to have a conversation because you are shouting across the table. It's even more crowded in the winter-time since customers have their winter coats, scarves, bags and usually some shopping bags with them and trying to squeeze onto the bench next to someone with all their stuff beside them is a pain. The window seats (for 1-2 people) are the most coveted spots since they are the most private - if you don't mind people on the street walking by and checking out your food!

It's located steps from the Ryerson campus so it caters well to those on a student budget. I wish they were open on Sundays."}
{"text":"What a joke! Greeted at the door by \"Caitlyn\" who had a mouthful of food. How lovely. Refused to seat us at a booth, which made no sense, as there was two or three open booths available. Sat us at the communal bench tables, which by the way Salad King, NOBODY wants to sit on a stool beside strangers while they eat. When we asked politely again to be seated at the booth, she replied rudely, \"maybe you should go somewhere else.\" We were blown away at how inappropriate and unprofessional she was. Never again, and I don't recommend this place to anyone. It used to be better and has gone way downhill over the years.

PS. If you're closing the restaurant for the day, but are still open and have customers still eating, please do your customers a favour and don't rush them out and make them feel uncomfortable while you stack chairs on tables and sweep around the customers feet. It is rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"The GOOD:
--  Low prices
--  Good food
--  Menu that offers good variety

The BAD:
--  Very LOUD
--  Papaya Salad was below average.  I'd pass next time.
--  Slow service

Really, no complaints with regards to food.  Ordered several noodle dishes which all tasted good.  The papaya salad was too sour and needed more fish sauce.  

The place is REALLY LOUD so don't go if you want to converse.  Service was slow and it was difficult to get a hold of the waitress when you needed something."}
{"text":"I'm from Vancouver where Thai food is still pretty traditional.  So when in Toronto, I had to try one of their popular Thai Restaurants.  Salad King in downtown Toronto is a happening place. I went there on a Saturday night and the place was packed.  Our party of 4 had to squeeze into one of the communal tables.  Sitting shoulder to shoulder with strangers really gave us a chance to see what others were eating.

The food was a little different than what I have become used to.  Instead of shared plates it seemed that everybody was ordering their own meals.  There was also some Asian fusion going on here, so I would not classify this as an authentic Thai restaurant.  As for the taste,  I like it a bit spicier and with more aroma.

Salad King is an interesting experience if you're ever in downtown Toronto and crave a little Thai food."}
{"text":"Service has improved since the renovation and the relocation. Staff seemed friendlier and food still comes in a timely manner. Food quality wise, I'm kind of left neutral here because somedays its great, somedays it's ok."}
{"text":"lab just order food for lunch. i have thai fried rice. the food just so so. but in a large quantity anyway. See somebody commended it as the best thai food in toronto. I just keep my opinion"}
{"text":"\"meh\" is a great word to describe this place.

pros and cons:

+great location
+pretty fast to get food
+big space for location
+inexpensive

-not very good food (not as whitewashed as Spring Rolls, but you get the idea)
-super hot inside
-usually really crowded
-not very good food

= meh. if you're lazy/too tired to figure out to go while in the area, you could do worse (or better)."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and have always had a very adequate experience. The food comes out quick and fresh, and tastes good. I usually order the green curry. it comes with an rich and sweet broth, filled with broccoli and sweet peas, served with rice shaped like a pyramid.

The last time I went to the Salad King there was one pretty big disappointment - I ordered the Tom yum soup, which is supposed to be lemongrass broth with mushrooms, chicken, and shrimp. But when it came there was no chicken or shrimp; it was just broth. Half the substance of the dish was missing. It was odd to me.

Otherwise I would say that if you are in the area, try the green curry or any of the curries really. The noodles are all right too."}
{"text":"Ordered Bangkok Stir Fry.  Big plate of grey soggy noodle with no vegetables except some old looking broccoli. Very disappointing as was recommended but will not go again. Service was slow. Overpriced."}
{"text":"I've been here before and after their renovations.  Cafeteria style seating with students from the university across the street.  Best place in that side of town if you want to avoid the grease from the Eaton Centre food court.  This place is loud.  Upstairs is Linda where it is more quiet and more expensive."}
{"text":"My friends and I usually go to Salad King if we want something better than food court. They have good and speedy customer services, and the price is moderate for a restaurant. I am always impress on how fast they can serve this many people at once since the place is so big. The food was ok, standard for Thai foods, and it was a pretty good portion."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 3 times and always order their islamic noodle. In the end, I always get diarrhea. I have never had any problem with Thai spices before since I grew up in South East Asia. I tried their Thai Ice Tea and it tasted awful. There's a cotton candy after taste to it? I've had Thai Ice tea before and it 's definitely not supposed to taste like that. I like the seats though, it makes you feel like you're eating in one of those street hawkers. However, there are better and cleaner Thai place in the GTA so I probably will not come back."}
{"text":"Definitely a students joint, but offers good Thai fair at reasonable prices with average portion sizes. Got the yellow curry - hot and fresh. As alluded to by other yelpers the seating leaves something to be desired, but it's all about managing one's expectations; cafeteria style seating leads to a noisy and busy atmosphere, but if you're just looking for a quick bite and then to be on your way, it's great!"}
{"text":"If you're a Ryerson student and haven't stepped foot here. Shame on you. 
Try the islamic noodles (you have to request for it cause its not on the menu). 
Very packed and noisy. I wouldn't recommend for big groups or date cause its hard to hear each other. Great casual dining experience.  Decent prices for thai food in downtown. I would say they have some unique dishes and flavours. Be warned of the chili scale!  If you want to have take out for lunch, I suggest pre-ordering it on the phone before coming in to pick it up. It saves ALOT of time!"}
{"text":"10 years ago, when I went to Ryerson, I used to eat at Salad King at least once a week. It was truly an addiction at one point, testing out the 10, 15, and 20 chilly dishes. You actually feel drunk when eating that many chillies! Salad King at one point could do no wrong. The lime leaf chicken was my go-to dish. The green vegetable curry was tops in the city. The cashew nut chicken left me always wanting more. The price was excellent and the place always jam packed. 

Then the fire happened, they switched to the new, bigger location, and quality went down. I think the ingredients they use are cheaper and way they operate, it's meant to get you in and out as fast as possible. The service is really quick, but you always get the sense that they are rushing you so that the next group of customers can come in and give them their money. 

Salad King got it's reputation as the best thai food in the city back in the day for a reason. But it's a shell of its former self. I rarely return here anymore, as it's got the fast food feel and the food just isn't the same, but will always have great memories of the university days, where Ryerson students were lucky to have such a gem on campus."}
{"text":"This popular restaurant located just North of Yonge/Dundas area offers a variety of delicious Thai dishes at a very affordable price.  It's no wonder why Salad King the go-to place for Ryerson University and other college students.  There's usually a line up but the servers are very efficient and you never wait too long.

Khao Soi Noodle Soup - Egg noodles, chicken, bean sprout, shallot, shrimp, lime in coconut curry soup.  This soup is very hearty and is not too overwhelming with curry and spice.

The Islamic Noodles, which isn't on the normal menu has green pepper, chicken, onions, mushroom, carrots and rice noodles in peanut coconut sauce.  Its super saucy and flavourful - definitely a favourite from this place!  I couldn't get enough of this.

Shrimp with Cashew came with a side bowl of jasmine rice.  Even though this was 3 chili spiciness, it was too spicy for me.  The combination of cashews and shrimp was very delicious though. If it was less spicy, I would have enjoyed it more.

I love that you can adjust the spiciness level to your taste.  I woud recommend their Islamic Noodles and other noodle dishes.  I like them more than specialty seafood dishes you get with a side of rice."}

Extra information:

*Big portions
*huge communal tables
*Busy at lunch crowd
*Vegetarian option Avail
*Hidden menu option

They are located close to Dundas Square on the second floor on Yonge Street and it could be easy to miss since they don't have a huge sign outside. But keep your eyes open and you will see the menu outside the door where the elevator is located.

As I am writing this review, I've been back 3 times (at least) so far but the first time I went, it was for lunch on a Saturday. Thanksfully I went early enough so there was no wait and we got one of the few booths avail.

Ordered: PAPAYA SALAD 1/5
*Green papaya with Thai dressing for $5
*Had the best papaya salad in Thailand last summer so I was excited to see this on the menu
*When this first arrived, I was confused for a second and thought maybe they took my order wrong
*This had strips of papaya with tomato, peanut bits, dried shrimp and lime juice
*This was basically pieces of papaya drenched in lime juice
*It was just very sour with the lime juice and I couldn't taste any garlic or peanuts
*Original papaya salad should be bursting with different flavors of garlic, peanuts, fish sauce and cilantro
*They were just doing it completely wrong and I don't know if people actually enjoy this cause it was horrible
*I would never ever get this again and even if they gave it to me for free, I wouldn't eat it

Ordered: BEEF SATAY SKEWERS 3/5
*4 skewers for $5
*These are made with thin beef slices instead of beef cubes
*served with thick peanut sauce which was good but it had this weird color
*Peanut sauce was more so mustardy-mayoy than peanut butter
*Meat had good flavor but it was so thin I feel like this dish could be cheaper

Ordered: GREEN CURRY WITH CHICKEN 3.5/5
*Served with jasmine rice for $8.75
*Green curry had chicken, green bean, broccoli and basil
*Curry itself wasn't too creamy but it had good coconut flavor
*As I was scooping some up to have it with my rice, I found the curry to be too runny
*It came with lots of chicken pieces but near the end, I had too much curry compared to the rice

Ordered: ISLAMIC NOODLES 5/5
*This is their not so secret 'secret menu' that was super popular when they were open at last location
*It's not on the menu, but if you ask they will make it for you (and you def want to ask for this!)
*Pad Thai noodles drenched in coconut curry for $10.50
*Came with 4-5 shrimp and chicken pieces on top
*The sauce is creamy with a bit of kick which was perfect with the noodles
*Lots of veggies (green pepper and red pepper) were on top
*I could def taste lots of spice in this particular dish
*I really enjoyed this and understand why it's one of their most popular dish

Overall there was a good service, our server was Rob who wasn't over the top friendly, but was attentive and filled up our water when needed. That's more than good enough at busy restaurants like this especially at usy lunch hour.

After my first visit, I went back couple more times and I will just include my comments about the dishes within this posting.

Ordered: MINIATURE SHRIMP ROLLS 4/5
*10 mini shrimp spring rolls for $4.50
*This is perfect as an appetizer in terms of taste, portion and price
*They are nothing special and you coulod probably get them anywhere but for $4.50, it's perfect for sharing
*It's filled with shrimp inside and goes very well with the sweet plum sauce

Ordered: THAI FRIED RICE 3/5
*Fried rice with eggs, shrimp, chicken, carrots, onions and curry sauce
*Tasted just like any other Chinese fried rice but with hint of curry
*I needed hot sauce for this dish cause it was kind of bland and dry
*It was nothing special and I probably won't get this again

Ordered: THAI BASIL NOODLE 3.5/5
*Rice noodles stir fried with veggies and shrimp with garlic, chili, shallows and dried shrimp sauce
*This was just another version of Pad Thai for me, except with the tomato-ey ketchupy taste
*Again, some basil leaf thrown on top...is it suppose to work as garnish?
*Thai food is usually known for dishes with lots of complex flavors altogether but this was very bland
*It was decent, but I much prefer the Islamic noodles I had last time

Summary: I've been to Salad King about 3 times so far and I really do like it. Now I know what to order and what's good here. I recommend going early if you are dropping by for lunch and don't expect to have a important conversation here because it gets super loud due to their low ceiling. I recommend, Mini Shrimp Spring rolls, Beef/Chicken skewers and Islamic Noodles(yum!)"}
{"text":"I have been to this place almost more than 10 times, but the only reason I come back to this place are the Islamic Noodles. They make that to perfection. I have tried other dishes but I think the noodles top the list for me.

If you guys are fan of fried rice then I would recommend Thai Fried rice.

{"text":"A great, really affordable spot for lunch. This place is located close to Ryerson and Yonge and Dundas Square so it can get really busy and loud. 

They have a huge menu and are accommodating to dietary restrictions. Be careful when ordering too many chilis - it can get HOT HOT HOT"}
{"text":"I love Salad King!

Being a Ryerson student, I have been here many times, including before the new location opened. We are usually seated promptly- only once did we ever have to wait a long time for service. It's not fancy of course, but I have yet to order something that is not delicious. Casual atmosphere, GREAT food, especially for the price, and most importantly- fast serving speeds. Very good for lunch hour/study breaks.
Local favourite for sure!
Try the cashew nut chicken."}
{"text":"Nothing great to say about this place.

Way too bright, way too loud. Food is meh. Nothing worth mentioning. The communal seating is annoying if anything. The servers seem to constantly be harassed, which is likely a sign there needs to be more staff.

The rice was overdone, as was the chicken. The sauce was oily and not appealing, I had the golden/yellow/whatever curry chicken. Chicken was not tasty, but tough.

My friends seemed satisfied with their meals, but I think most people want a little more than satisfaction. There are many, MANY, better thai restaurants in Toronto. This was on par with the thai food my university used to serve in the residence hall.

The only reason I don't give it one star is that I've heard good things about this place, so someone must like it."}
{"text":"Why is this place called Salad King anyway? My first impression when hearing its name was that it was a vegan restaurant. But was surprised that it was a trendy fast food Thai place. Upbeat decor and good value for the price.

Reliable Thai food though sometimes the spicy scale isn't precise. Somewhere from medium to three peppers is fine for most people and anything higher might give you an ulcer.

Best dishes: The pad thai, basil noodles, peanut sauce, and mango salad. 

Meh dishes: The beef satay was dry, the shrimp appetizer was tiny and like snacks from the frozen food aisle."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the atmosphere is sooo dependent on your neighbours, whom you have no control over.  

I've been stuck with a wide range of diners: the awkward first daters, the Ryerson students who shovel their food and flee, the older couple who look obviously out of place, and the gaggle of girls who shriek every 5 minutes.  

Courtesy and space-sharing is at the discretion of bedfellows thanks to the cafeteria-style layout. 

Go for a cheap-ish Thai night but mind your manners and don't expect to lounge for longer than it takes to eat your food.  The servers are not shy about bringing your bill around as soon as the dishes are cleared."}
{"text":"Nothing has changed! Salad King is a Ryerson university student staple and I have so many positive memories of meals here. Yesterday at lunch was no different. Arriving at 11:40 AM on a Friday, we watched the restaurant's full transition from empty to packed. 

The food was the same goodness that I remember. The crispiest spring rolls with piping hot insides and a vinegary, thin dipping sauce. Three thick cigars to an order, great value. The green and yellow curries we ordered were also a little on the thin side but still warmed us up perfectly. The choose-your-own-chili assures you of that. 

Nowadays, restaurants come and go, so it's nice to come back to one and be able to acknowledge they are still doing a-ok many years later!"}
{"text":"The food rocks and they gave me free authentic chopsticks for Christmas one year. That pretty much sums it up. 

TIP: Spicy Chicken with three chillies. Go get it!"}
{"text":"Everyone has to try the Islamic Noodles. This is an off menu item that those in the loop order. It is a combination of their Thai noodles and Panang curry! So amazing!!! 

I took away one star because I've tried their Pad Thai inthe past and didn't think anything of it. I felt that it just tasted too bland... not quite as flavourful as the Thai Express in most food courts. However, the islamic noodles are amazing!!! A must try!"}
{"text":"Salad King has easily become one of my favorite thai restaurants in the GTA! 

One of my friends recommended I try Salad King because I am a huge chili head (I love spicy food). I decided to give it a go.

My first time going to Salad King, I tried their Shrimp Phud Thai with 20 chili's. The spice was definitely right! And the pad thai tasted delicious. The price is fair and the portions are pretty large.

I've also tried their Islamic Noodles. Not my favorite dish but it definitely has a unique flavor. It kind of reminds me of pad thai, but with a coconut based sauce.

The layout of this restaurant is quite interesting. Half the restaurant has traditional seating arrangements, whereas the other half has long, communal style tables with stools. Under the stools of these tables are baskets for you to put your belongings (or jacket). To be honest, it's a bit difficult to hold a good conversation in the communal seating area, but it's not a huge drawback (avoid for first dates).

The service is decent. The server will make sure to come by to get your order, but rarely do they check up on you so you'll need to wave them down for the bill.

Overall, I'd recommend Salad King. They've become my go-to place for pad thai!"}
{"text":"Been to MANY Thai restaurants and I always get a curry as my main. I decided to try out Salad King as I know it has been around for a while, and had heard great reviews back when I was in undergrad. I ordered the yellow curry, and it was by far one of the worst I have had. You can tell the ingredients are canned/frozen prior to be added into the curry. The chicken was mushy and in very small pieces. I also had the spring rolls to start and they were quite good and large in size. Wouldn't not recommend this place as I was so disappointed with my order. Would also like to add that they forgot to include rice with my delivery order...it was curry...how could they forget. 
For a better curry, check out PAI, been there a few times now and always leave with a smile"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good, potentially greasy Thai food, Salad King is the way to go.

Located conveniently between College and Dundas (on Yonge), it's the perfect place to grab some grub before an exam, or after a long day of work. 

I had the Kari noodles at a level of 3 chilis. The restaurant allows you to choose how spicy you want your dish, ranging from \"medium\" to \"20 chilis\". If you value your life, I would not go to 20 chilis, as 3 left my sniffing and sweating like a crazy person.

The noodles were really great. Full of flavour and piled with vegetables and meat instead of loading up the dish with mainly noodles. 

I enjoyed the atmosphere as well. It's casual but clean, and sits on the second floor of the building so you feel a bit separated from the street below, making it a true escape.

Super affordable (with no drink, approximately $10 for dinner) and great food, a definite staple for students and young working folk alike."}
{"text":"I was really sad when I learned that Salad King burned down last year.  When I found out it was re-opening down the street I was very happy as this is one of my favourite Thai places in Toronto.

My brother and I dropped in and were stuck behind a large lineup.  We walked to the front to get our name on the waiting list and were lucky that they had a seat for 2 immediately.

If you've never come here you'll find out quickly that there are a lot of tables but they will seat you side by side with others.  We were added to a table for 6 and it seemed the 4 were not all together.  We sat down and looked around to the new place.  It looks a lot bigger than it did before.

Our server dropped by with menus and some water and we had a quick chat about graffiti.  After looking over the menu we got some skewers, mango salad and I ordered the Golden Curry with Chicken...5 chilli's.  

Our appetizers came out fairly quickly and we started with the mango salad.  I had a gut feeling it was the wrong time to order this and I was right.  The mango's were pretty sour, a lot more sour than I like.

The skewers were up next and I loved these so much.  The beef was cooked perfectly and the peanut sauce is very good.  A lot of beef skewers I order are usually overcooked, not at Salad King!

It wasn't long until our mains came out and boy did it look and smell delicious.  I poured some of the curry and other goodness over the rice and I could pick up this amazing smell of all the ingredients.  Upon my first bite it was the same Salad King I had remembered.  The meal was great...and did I mention the price is amazing?

Our server was really friendly and really nice.  I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. Tasty food, clean place and fast service."}
{"text":"This place is always so busy and they always are attentive and prompt! In short, because I haven't been there since last summer (but went several times over the course of it) the food is lovely and I used to always get the Non-spicey pad Thai (noodles are out of this world) .. Dish is so flavourful! 
Another thing I really appreciate (as I can't tolerate spice at allllll, hate it) is the fact they have the proper symbol beside the spicey dishes! 


Have literally no complaints about this place"}
{"text":"Omg!!! The food was so good and tasty! The thai tea was really refreshing and the service so great.
This Thai restaurant is cool for both options, If you go with friends or date!!!
I really like the concept and the menu :)
Totally recommend!!! 
About the price, i think is fare and not expensive at all!!
Another good point is about the portions!! they're big!!! So probably you'd be satisfied with one dish."}
{"text":"It's been consistent since moving into the new location (after the old location on Ghold burnt down), but it will never be as good as it was waaaay back in the day when they only had 3 dishes and sold food out of a little hole on the building. 

Ask for the Islamic noodles (which aren't on the menu) and are delicious - better than the pad thai, which is not authentic pad thai anyway. 

Overall: not a fancy thai place, but helps the thai food craving for a reasonable price. Nothing to be overly excited about."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for a quick, inexpensive Thai meal. Their service is very fast and efficient, the food is good (likely not the highest quality but still very good) and  prices are reasonable ($10-18 for a plate). Most of the plates cater to Western palates as they often include coconut milk and sugar. 

Also, every plate has the option of being made more spicy. There's about 7 different levels of spice. My friend and I tried the 5th level and died. We had to order a glass of milk to help us eat and still were only able to eat half of our serving. Be conservative when you choose how spicy you want your meal!"}
{"text":"The 15 chilies I asked for in my rainbow chicken had 0 chilies. Was very disappointed. We got take out so couldn't even go back to ask for a side of chillies.  I find the level of spice you ask for is inconsistent."}
{"text":"Always tasty, but the food was much better at their old location and the prices have gone up. However if you're looking for good service, a comfortable atmosphere, and pretty tasty food this is still one of the better places to go in the area."}
{"text":"Usually pretty good. Not always the best. The curry is surprisingly good. Can get pretty busy, so sometimes it's hard to flag someone down. Never had a problem, so if you want something cheap, here's your place."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for reasonably priced thai food. The portions are good and the food tastes great. I commonly go there for their amazing pad thai and other noodle dishes. Unfortunately their meat dishes are a bit disappointing, the sauce on top tends to be really liquid-y as if it's a soup. For that reason, I would not recommend getting meat dishes from here. Although I do recommend all the noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Can a restaurant jump the shark? Because if so, I think Salad King has officially jumped the shark.  I used to love this place for the uniquely frenzied atmosphere, crazy spice scale, and most importantly, good food.  I came here for lunch last Thursday, and the first thing to greet me was a sign on the door proclaiming, \"Now serving Khao Soi!\". SWEET! One of my favs from Khao San Road!!  I'm definitely ordering it to compare! Well sadly, there was no comparison, and after trying the khao soi, it is apparent that Salad King is just keeping up with the status quo, instead of coming up with anything original.  My khao soi came in the most watery, runny sauce imagineable, and when I looked around at my other dining companions who had ordered their usual favs like the green curry, I realized that everyone's dish was watered down!!  Not cool, Salad King!  You can't serve curry that can be mistaken for tom yum soup.

Sadly, I think I will still keep coming back to Salad King, in the same way I kept watching The Simpson long after I should've stopped. There's just something about it that holds a special place in my heart, and really, it's not THAT bad..."}
{"text":"Everytime I am in Toronto I have to stop in to Salad King.  One of my best friends lives here and she introduced me to it when she was a student at Ryerson.  That was ages ago and now we still go back everytime.  The Thai Islandic Noodles (not on the menu downstairs but you can order it anyways) are fantastic.  If you are a peanut sauce fan, then this is the dish.  5 chilli is the max so that you dont ruin the dish.  Its quite interesting as it is cafeteria style seating and always full.  Some of the places they try and sit you, you practically have to crawl over someone when it is packed.  But the food comes quick, the service is good and the bill is low.  Salad King is always on my to do in the T Dot."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? Salad King used to be one of the best Thai restaurants downtown Toronto, no contest. As of April 2016, I am completely disappointed after making the drive down from south-west Scarborough for what used to be my favourite Thai food. Coconut Milk Chicken Soup: very disappointing. No sweet and savoury combination of flavour, very few bits of mushroom and a few bits of chicken with lots of tendons still attached, topped with a giant piece of wilted lettuce. I've had better at Thai food chain restaurants! Spring rolls were average, the vegetables inside were cut too large and not the usual meticulously chopped veggies of Spring Rolls of the past. Panang Curry: the sauce was still good but again, low quality chicken and a few very thin shreds of green and red peppers and that's it. We got take out and it was hard to tell which was the curry main dish and which was the soup! Steamed rice was fine, but you have to work hard to screw that up. Golden Curry...wow, what a huge disappointment. Barely any chicken or vegetables. The prices are average, not exceptionally cheap but the food is cheap in quality and amount. I certainly won't waste my time making the drive down for what once was excellent quality Thai food. There are much better places in Scarborough who provide delicious food with quality ingredients in generous amounts for reasonable prices  AND they include free spring rolls or an additional entree when you spent more than $40 or $50. SALAD KING, YOU HAVE LOST YOUR WAY AND NOW LOST ANOTHER CUSTOMER. What a HUGE disappointment. I am honestly considering calling the manager tomorrow to make a complaint, but then what would they offer me, more of their substandard food? No thanks! Thai One On is an excellent \"chain\" that provides, fresh, delicious Thai food with huge portions full of meat and vegetables UNLIKE YOU SALAD KING. After 20 years of singing your praises, I am now going to avoid you like Dengue Fever! 

Don't waste your time! On Yonge Street go on up to The Green Mango, they have excellent prices and the food is high quality and delicious! 

You had best get your groove back, Salad King, because people are not going to put up with this nonsense, not when there are so many other amazing Thai restaurants in this city!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed, and for a good reason.

The price is very reasonable, they have good selection, they serve Thai beer, and they have satay.  The seats are tight, so watch out.  There is a basket underneath each seats so it nice and convenient.

Their Penang curry is nice and smooth.  You can spice it all the way up and, as my British mate said, blow your tits off.  It's nice.  Try their off the menu Islamic Noodle as well.  It's like pad thai with red curry pour on top.  One order of that can serve 2.

Easy 4 stars for them.  They are doing something right.

The End."}
{"text":"Edit- the quality has gone down...

Love this place! Been coming here for years. Food is always dependable n good. I usually get a curry dish or noodle dish. I would recommend this place to Torontonians and tourists."}
{"text":"3.5/5
Salad King is like a better, bigger and more authentic version of Thai express. Fast food style with servers, longer menu and less personal space. The food here is good and affordable, convenient location too, but nothing stand out. It is great that they offer decent choices for vegetarians and have spicy level to choose from. However I noticed that their cooking are quite inconsistent. 

This place is always busy during lunch/dinner hour. Most of the time you would have to share table and sit between other customers. Not sure if they do reservation, but if I am reserving a table might as well go to PAI or other restaurant.

One thing I have to point out is the chili count(spicy level). There's a few times my friend and I ordered food with 3 chili, but mine turned out very mild(1chili?) and his tasted like 6-8 chili. That happened a few times already. Get your things together salad King, there's this chili count for a reason!

Their golden tofu is what I usually order, very well made. The pad Thai is also decent.
I had the evil jungle prince here once before, expecting mostly eggplants in it since that's impression the description gave. The dish came with lots of onions, lots of green peppers, a couple of other vegetables and a few tiny pieces of eggplant(evil indeed), tasted watered down too. Yup, pretty disappointed. That takes half a star away since you took my eggplants.

I would recommend salad King for a quick tasty meal, but if you want gourmet Thai food this is not the right place."}
{"text":"Decor/Atmosphere: It's very simple, but nice inside. Not too many decorations, and tables and stools are set up in a cafeteria manner. It gets very loud when its busy and its hard to maintain a conversation, thats the only down fall. 

Menu/Food: A lot of different choices for appetizers, curries, noodles, rice, soups, and small dessert menu. 

I usually order spring rolls, miniature shrimp rolls, mango salad, hot sour soup, hello curry with chicken, panang curry with chicken, thai islamic noodles, sea food fried rice, and thai basal chicken. (Not that I order all of this in one sitting, but a few of the dishes I have ordered through out my visits here). 

The curries are excellent, and I am not a fan of chilli so I have mine set to 3 always, and add extra if needed. All of the above dish are excellent, and they provide you with a big portion. I always have left overs to take home. I love all the food here so much so I can't really say anything negative as I haven't had a bad experience yet. 

Customer Service: The staff is great, always friendly and smiling. 

Price: Very cheap fast thai food. You can spend $10-12 on a dish and the quantity is worth two meals. 

Overall: I come to Salad King at least once a month with friends, and I have been coming here since undergrad, so it is definitely one of top favourite places to eat. I hope they have this place around for many more years to come!"}
{"text":"Average Thai food at average prices.

I like to visit Salad King every now and again when I'm in the area and can't decide where to go. It's reasonably priced (student crowd) and tasty enough. Can be hard to get your server's attention as they all seem to cover a lot of tables but worth it for a quick, reasonably tasty meal."}
{"text":"It's been almost 4 years since my first review of Salad King, and I can't say anything has changed - this is a good thing. Still my most-frequented lunch and/or dinner spot near Ryerson University. If you come between 2-5pm and show student ID, you get 20% off. 

Since it's cafeteria-style seating, this place is best for eating alone or with a maximum of two other people. You wouldn't have a great time bringing a larger group, unless you somehow get one of the few booths (unlikely)."}
{"text":"Salad king is a great place to go if you want to get full on a budget. Their Pad Thai is huge and taste alright for 12$. It's not as saucy as Thai express but some people like that. I also like to order their noodle soup or sticky rice with mangos. The service is usually good here. I think I've only really had one bad experience out of 10. It's a great place to grab a quick bite or come in a group. Out all the Thai places I've been to, prob not the best but good enough to satisfy a craving. Debit is accepted so yay!"}
{"text":"Have no clue why this place is so popular. Everything about it is just average. I can think of many restaurants in the area with reasonable prices that are much better.

Taking our order took quite a long time, but at least it arrived fast after we ordered. 
In terms of this place being a Thai restaurant, I can say it had some of the worst Thai food I've ever tried. 
I got a soup which had a lot of noodles, and almost nothing else in it. We went there, cause someone mentioned it was worth trying. Well, it wasn't! I won't be going there again.
Thai country kitchen, which is near College and Spadina is 10 times better."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! It's literally steps away from Ryerson Uni. 
My friend took me here and was excited to try out a new Thai place. 

Ordered the thai golden chicken curry... Delicious! If you can handle spice, a good amount of spice is 2, enough to enjoy the meal as well as the level of heat. Anything more than 3 is just not good anymore. Another thing to try is their pad thai too! 
The only thing I didn't like during my visit was the high noise level... My friend and I were literally screaming to one another even though we were right across the table."}
{"text":"islamic noodles is great, not on the menu but its really good. try their soups, their tom yum soups in seafood and chicken , they are really spicy so beware!

their dessert sucks, tried all of them, save your money and go for a desert place.

too loud to have a convo so  if you have bad date and don't want to hear them speak, a great place to be!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere might not be the best, but the food is really good! Definitely worth a visit. I would recommend their curry to anyone, but if you are looking for a place to have a nice quiet conversation with a friend, you should probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A great place to go in the Yonge and Dundas desert. 

Pretty generic food, but good fast and cheap-ish. 

Fun decor."}
{"text":"Salad King only gets a 2 star today.
The food is not bad (it's under $10 for a meal, so don't expect fine dining here)
They let me down today because I could not switch the protein option. I have worked in restaurants all my life and still do and I just feel a simple modification as switching the kind of chicken breast should be ok ( I just wanted to switch to a breaded chicken breaks as I have been craving it all day) and I was just told no, would have been nice to at least ask the kitchen first as it is a very simple modification. I did offer to pay any extra charge. 
Basically don't expect them to try to accommodate you too much.  Either that or the server just felt like saying no..."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Toronto. Great Thai food - I HIGHLY recommend the Golden Curry. So good you can eat it like soup. Half of the restaurant is cafeteria-style and the noise levels are a bit high, but the food is worth it. Good value."}
{"text":"I love Thai food. I went to Salad King because of the review, but I found out this is Chinese style Thai food. Definitely not prepared by Thai...The price is $1-2 cheaper than those good Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Its an interesting, cafeteria style seating restaurant.  The food can be mild to uber-spicy; your choice.  Its very busy at lunch time.  Menu selection is pretty good and the food is good.  Its not some delicacy that will leave you craving more (that and the portions are generally fairly large so good luck even finishing your dish), but it hits the spot, is easy on your pocket book, and is kind of fun.  The staff are pretty friendly too.

I think its worth a visit to form your own opinions."}
{"text":"I love Salad King. There was a time when I would eat here once a week.... sad. But I love it! The last time I went the host was a bit of the ditz but my server made up for her bitcyness. The food is great for something that cost's under $11. If you are hungry after Eaton Centre or class then I would defiantly check it out. I'll be there again this week. =)"}
{"text":"The food and prices are decent - not fantastic.  However the seating is uncomfortable - they try to jam as many customers in as they can. The environment is also very very loud.  If you go there for a weekday lunch, you can barely talk to the person sitting across from you."}
{"text":"It used to be really good, and still kinda is, but I always leave with an upset stomach afterwards, as did my friends who I would frequent this place with."}
{"text":"Service and food have gone wayyyy down! It took 15 minutes to get water but only a minute to get the bill!!!

We ordered Kari noodles and Phud Thai and Kari noodles were awful! It was supposed to be with a curry sauce but there was no sauce to speak of. It was just dry! 

Plus their machines have the option for 15%, 18% and 20% or other. Tip is for good service and they automatically expect 15%?? No way! 

Service sucked and I won't be returning. The food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Impersonal restaurant... Seems more like a university cafeteria. The menu looks with many options but finally everything is the same. It looks like they use frozen ingredients. Wouldn't recommend.

The only good thing was the attention"}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic. I'm so glad I got a chance to try it. It's a must for everyone at some point.

There is something incredibly intimate and wonderful about sitting hip to hip with a complete stranger on either side of you. The mess hall style seating just really does it for me. The food is good but it's also cheap and extremely large portions.

My two cents on this place are about the chili rating. I like spice and can handle a moderate amount but after reading the reviews on this site I opted for just 3 thinking it would be quite spicy...mistake. Next time I would definitely go with 5 to 7 chilies. They're spicy but far from burn your mouth you can't handle it spicy. The Hot and Sour Mushroom soup on the other hand, now that's spicy!

Thai Basil Noodles are where it's at (better than the Bangkok Stir Fry).

Check this place out...you'll LOVE the atmosphere.

**EDIT: Came back here and tried the Thai Basil Noodles (still delicious) with 7 chilies this time. It was way too spciy to eat around friends. That kind of spice should be enjoyed in privacy. I think I'll stick with 5 chilies from here on out unless I'm getting take-out for one.***"}
{"text":"Had a noodle soup and was impressed with the fresh ingredients in it. Reasonable priced and worth the visit."}
{"text":"It's a cheap Thai option in town that will provide all the regular Thai dishes you crave (Pad Thai, Green Curry, etc).  Not the best Thai restaurant, but meets all my criteria for me to keep coming back for so many years."}
{"text":"Ordered phud thai w/ shrimp. It was okay. Won't order again. The sauce was sparse and lacking deep flavour. It also was fairly light and not the usual orangey-brownish colour a good phud thai has. They do offer a lot of shrimp though, which is pleasing.

Also tried the mango salad & some of my friend's \"shrimp delight\". The mango was a little too green & sour for my liking, and again, lacked enough dressing or sauce. Although it feels really healthy when you eat it. The shrimp delight was a no bueno. Wouldn't recommend it at all. You get about 10+ shrimps which is awesome, but its cooked alongside sparse green/red peppers & onions in a really runny sauce that tasted like pre-made canned Thai sauce you get from Metro.

Had coconut ice cream for dessert. Includes two scoops & two praline cigar cookies. Could be shared for two.    

The rest of the menu looks extremely appetizing though & definitely at good price points. I'm curious to try out more dishes, more specifically, the golden curry or tom yum. Spice is also true to flavour."}
{"text":"Good for a quick, cheap, satisfying bite. For Ryerson students, they'll have you in and out for you to make it to your next class on time :) Cafeteria style seating and tables. My order is usually Islamic Noodles 7 or 9 chilli (off menu item)"}
{"text":"I really dig the golden chicken curry here and every time I try to be adventurous and order something else, I get disappointed and go back to my curry with 5 chillies. A bit strange to find broccoli on it and the curry is on the sweet side but that's probably what makes it so memorable. 

I don't find anything else on the menu that notable but I have friends who find their fried rice excellent (I tend to disagree). The prices are great and since I always get take-out I can't complain about service.

I'd rate this place a 3 but the golden chicken curry adds a whole star to it."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto the group of girls I was with suggested we should go eat at Salad King. Me starving a faked my excitement dreading the thought of having salad. Little did I know how wrong I was... upstairs was Thai heaven. The place was packed and the menu has lots of variety. I wanted it all!!! Me and my friend shared one of the curries and one of the stir fries. Dishes came out fast and server was great but food... average. I know good Thai food and this didn't taste bad, it just lacked authenticity. I'm talking intense herb flavours and aromas. It felt more like an upper scale fast food joint. Curry lacked flavour and so did the stir fry. Prices are low and overall atmosphere was pleasant. I would recommend if you are new to Thai food!"}
{"text":"Nice menu and big portions. Prices are also good. The only downside is that it's usually quite crowded and noise.Recommended"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed 
Took my friends here after hearing good thought.  I had one of the veggie dishes and it was mainly rice w lettus and tiny shreds of carrots.  Can't believe I paid 12 $ for that! The taste was also soso. Only good thing was service was fast. Will likely not return."}
{"text":"Dropped by with my coworkers for a quick lunch. It was the St.Pattys Day Parade that day so it was a bit busy. When we walked in the waitress was friendly and we requested if we can sit near the window. Having a table of 5, I was worried they wouldn't have a table. And viola! There was a table. I've actually sat at that exact table before. It's a bit odd cause it's in the corner and a bit tough to get in. But when we ordered we presented the City Of Toronto coupons for free spring rolls. Instantly water was brought to our table. We ordered and our waiter was pretty awesome. But he forgot the spring rolls. It's okay though. Then there was a scene with an old man wanting to watch the parade near the window but there was no table open. So he forced his way into a seat. The waitress apologized to us and the manager took care of it well. So back to the food. Great food. Great price. But we reminded our waiter about the spring rolls and within a minute he got them. Even though it was given at the end of our meal... it turned into a dessert. Haha. Great place!"}
{"text":"Serviceable Thai I suppose.  Nothing great.  I used to live across from them 10 years ago and eat there daily and it was amazing at that time.  It is most certainly a proverbial hollow shell of its former self, but it's still serviceable.  Certainly no Pai or anything to write home about...."}
{"text":"Went here on a weekend during the day after being in the area for the NXME music thingymajig. 

Firstly I hate waiting for anything longer than 5 minutes, I get agitated and fiddle and break things so it was no surprise that I bumped into a vase and broke it after waiting for nearly 15 minutes to be seated.

The place was busy but the available tables were only for 4+ groups so since it was just me and my friend we had to wait for seats to come free in the communal area. First time I have seen this in Toronto and I was never a big fan of it in the UK and I am still not a big fan of having to share my personal space whilst eating with people I do not know. 

The menu at first instance looked good, there are a fair few dishes and you have the option of requesting anything from a 1 chilli to a 20 chilli dish - I think a 20 chilli dish would require waxing of the tongue Home Simpson style so I went for a Beef Dish at level 5.

The food came out super quick, as if the kitchen staff had a precognitive vision of what I would order before I had a chance to break anything, but I would have preferred in this case to wait for something that did not look rushed or not looked like the beef had been cooked in the morning and kept on a low heat till i arrived.

So overall the experience was disappointing, the service was, once seated, quick and the waiter kept the water topped up and was polite and attentive.

Do not see myself going here in a rush any time soon unless I have a group of 20 to seat."}
{"text":"I can tell that this place is quite popular from how full it was when we walked in. The curry dishes are excellent here. I was out with two of my friends and both happen to be lactose intolerance, and we just happen to wander past this place, three of us also prefer different level of spiciness to which one of my friend can't have spicy food at all, the other likes extremely spicy food. This place is perfect because it uses coconut milk for its curry and has different spicy levels for its curry dishes. I believe the different levels are 1, 3, 5, 10, 20? The wait time was less than 20 min which is not too bad for downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"After spending $30ish for two people ... we both left hungry?!  :(

My husband, little guy, and I all decided to go to the Salad King on a weeknight when I didn't feel like cooking.  I had been dying to try this place out based on all the positive reviews. 

We ordered a lemon grass soup, thai basil noodles (YUM), and siam fried rice.  The food itself was decent ... although it sort of tasted a little westernized.  My husband enjoyed the fried rice while I preferred the noodles - loved the texture  ... yum!  The soup was average.

The service was extremely friendly.  Everyone was so accomodating and friendly to our little guy.  The hostess gave him a little sticker which he found to be delicious.

The restaurant is on the second floor but it is handicap accessible - there is an elevator.

The decor is very modern and cool.  The place was bustling for a Monday night.  Lots of young university students ... which is why I was surprised that both my husband and I left feeling hungry?!  Aren't university students usually starving and strapped for cash?"}
{"text":"Green Curry Chicken 1 Chili Pepper my favorite dish, will stop by again for some more."}
{"text":"Always a good experience at salad king. Spacious so it's great for people who have a lot of company. The food there is so affordable and the plates really do fill you up for such a great price!!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, reasonable prices, decent service, decent amount of options. Food arrived really quickly. 
Food wasn't that great, but it wasn't bad either- it was ok. I was expecting more since my friends were all raving about it. I haven't been to many Thai restaurants but I think I prefer Thai one on, although Salad king is much cheaper.

I also really appreciate how they have a spiciness scale from medium to 20, which is pretty awesome. I love, love love spicy food - I am the crazy person who picks chili peppers out of dishes and eats them plain- and I went for an 8 for my green curry beef, which I found to be a good spiciness level for me (noticeable spicy, but in a very comfortable way)- so I imagine 20 must be really spicy. One of the few places, in my personal experience, that actually mean it when they say hot. 

Though it was spicy, I found the food a bit bland, and the rice tasted a bit like instant rice. 
I would come back again if I was in a hurry and not feeling adventurous enough to try a new place. Or maybe when I'm craving something super spicy."}
{"text":"Pretty decent thai food compared to other thai fast food places.
I got the Kari Noodles with vege option (5 chillies) and it was pretty tasty. I would prefer the noodles to have more veges though. There was a lot of noodles (enough for 2 people).

My friend got the Street Noodles (1 chilli) and she did not enjoy it. Rather tasteless.

Service was slow. It took them 15 mins to notice us and another 5 mins to send someone to take our orders."}
{"text":"The Thai Islamic noodle is beyond any noodle fish I've ever tasted. Absolutely give it a try, it's the only thing I ever order. And I order from here A LOT!!"}
{"text":"Five years ago this was a real gem. The restaurant seated about 50 people and the kitchen was over to the right corner. The portions were big and the service was quick. There was a really nifty microphone screeching \"NUMBA FOOOTEEEN\" and there was a sock covering the mic. There were Ernie and Linda in the back still serving and cooking themselves. These were the times Salad King deserved 5 stars. 

The service has lacked since the reopening a few years ago. Now seats 130 people downstairs and another 60 upstairs. Too many seats. The kitchen now slaps together pre-fried chicken and rice so sticky, you could use it as gunk to fix your exhaust pipes. 

It's still good and very adjusted to Salt, Sugar and Spice saturated North American taste buds (or should I say hung-over students?)
Curries tend to be a bit runny and the meats a bit dry.

Do yourself a favor: Go between peak hours, your portion size increases and the waiting time decreases, almost like good old times. 
Minus the sock-mic, my personal \"NUMBAAA WOOOOO\""}
{"text":"I was recently back at the Salad King. I've eaten here a bunch of times and this most recent dining experience was no exception to the great food and service I've come to expect.
I had previously tried the emerald and golden curry dishes which were both delicious with a really rich depth of flavour so I decided to try something similar but new for me: Evil Jungle Prince. It was a nice dish. Not quite as good as the curry dishes I had enjoyed before but definitely still tasty. It had good spice and hearty chunks of eggplant and baby corn.
I'd be interested to explore more of the menu next time I come back, but the curry dishes are calling my name and I might have to return for what's tried tested and true. 
The restaurant also has a fun and friendly atmosphere with their shared seating tables."}
{"text":"I've must have gone here over a dozen times. Great place to drop in and grab a quick bite to eat. I highly recommend their pagnang curry. Only criticism is that it's rather loud inside however totally worth it."}
{"text":"Best quick Thai food around. Love this place, went there all the time as a student and still visit occasionally when I have hankering for some good Thai."}
{"text":"By the infinite collective wisdom of Yelpers, I found myself here tonight for dinner.

And I must say, this place is a solid... MEH.

Firstly, yes, the food tastes good. Credit must be given. However, it falls short in other important aspects. I probably would come back to this place if I had to, but not with much excitement.

Ok to dispel the false rumors,  this place is not really that good of a good deal or value. I had a salad and a typical dish, and my bill cams to $18. Not exactly your budget or student diner as others have claimed.

Then there is the place itself. It is super loud. With each bite, you have to mumble serenity now serenity now serenity now and you might keep your sanity. But definitely bring your first dates here, it will give you an instant idea how sexy they are when yelling at you, in case you are curious.

Now for the decor and seating. The joint looks hip for sure, but what's with the cafeteria seating? This arrangement is clearly deliberate since it doesn't seem like they were shy about spending money on interior design. Whatever the reason, it is not really that pleasant. Others may disagree.

Overall, an average experience, and even slightly over priced. I prefer the ma and pa Thai restaurants you can easily find elsewhere."}
{"text":"Maybe I haven't sampled enough food here (since I don't seem to see in it what others do), but the 3 dishes (pad thai, golden curry, and some fried rice-esque dish) I've had from here were unfortunately disappointing.

Food did not taste authentic, and toppings were stingy. It was like the Harvey's of Thai food - you know it's nothing special, but you feel like it is compared to the other fast food options available. Nevertheless, I wouldn't compromise. Service is frazzled by the hordes of people sitting at communal tables in a large fancied-up cafeteria, where conversation is lost in the hubbub and the food is not good enough for silent contemplative enjoyment.

It's not too expensive - standard prices around $10 - but I would advise anyone who is picky about their pad thai (as I admittedly am) to venture elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ignore the hype.

I feel that it is my civic duty as a Torontonian to recommend against this place. This place deserves a sadface. If I could replace the stars above with sadfaces, this place would get fullout 5 sadfaces.

The food was beyond hideous. One time I got this awful, watery Thai soup at the Just Thai on Church St. and I vowed to myself never to go for cheap Thai food again. 

I had been to Salad King many years ago in the old location and the curry was okay so I thought that that, plus decent reviews on Yelp, plus the fact that it's quite pricey, plus the fact that Khao San was closed (Sunday) called for a second visit.

How wrong I was. Maybe it's under new management, I have no idea.

The Rainbow Chicken ($8.25) was a travesty. Plain water as broth had separated from the spiciness that leaves that distinctly gross orange oil as a film on my food. And that's not to say that it flavoured the food at all: the chicken was white, rubbery and devoid of all taste; the fixings were as cheap as they come (think frozen peas,  and onions) and I received 3, tiny, almost-white eggplants that tasted raw and half-cooked. Trust me, there was no lemongrass to be tasted in this dish. Simply hideous.

My partner got the Thai Noodle Soup ($7.25) and was sorely disappointed. The broth, as well, was some murky, Campbell's soup stock nonsense and the fixings were also on the cheap (celery in a Thai dish? Really?). 

For $20, I feel I deserved more. And having eaten Thai food in Thailand, I know so much more is possible for $20--not this fast food, reheated slop.

We wanted to get the mango sticky rice but judging by the quality of the entrees, we decided to cut our losses and head out.

So to sum up: you're getting fast-food Thai that barely deserves the name. You can get much better Thai at authentic places like Mengrai Thai if you can trek further East than Yonge (yes, you CAN).

The only positive aspects are the friendly wait staff and the awesome location and great atmosphere in the restaurant. So if you're allowed to come in and sit and chat, then by all means go to Salad King; if not, avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"First of all, I like the brief menu posted outside the entrance so you get a sense of the price range. I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the place was and how quickly we were seated (I was in a group of 6, and we got there a little after 1pm). The seating was comfortable and the space was big enough for all of us. The decor is colourful and it was nice being beside the window because you get lots of natural light. The staff were also quite friendly. 

There is a lot to choose from the menu. I had a simple wonton soup, my table mates had noodles, and curry. The wontons were pretty good, filled with chicken and shrimp, in a broth with bean sprouts, some pieces of lettuce, and coriander. Not too salty but a bit oily. I was impressed with the portion sizes of what other people ordered, you definitely get a big bowl of food. 

Something I found really interesting was the beer they offered. Two of the people I was with decided to get 2 litres of beer and it basically came in a huge tube with a spout. I thought it was quite impressive. It was a lot for 2 people to handle but we were in a bit of a rush, I'm sure that if we had more time it would have been more enjoyable for them. In the end, they had about 3 or 4 beers each (not sure, I kinda lost count) AND a little bit left over too. 

I definitely plan on coming back here to eat again."}
{"text":"Ordered their mango salad, satay chicken skewers, golden curry with chicken and rainbow chicken.  Mango salad taste was kind of bland, prob won't order it again. The satay chicken skewers were really good, would recommend it.  The golden curry was a bit on the sweet side, also little watery( not too thick sauce) I find it a bit bland for tast, but my girlfriend really liked it. She described the curry as \"tasted rich, however lacking in complexity\".  (she did eventually put some chilly sauce into the curry though lol. I guess I prefer a bit more strong flavored when it comes to curry, but I think it may please many ppl who likes a mild tasting style for curry.  The rainbow chicken is really dissapointment though, tasted like broiled chicken soaked in watery sauce that tasted somewhat like a watered down Tum Yum Gong soup.  Definitely would not order it again. I think next time if we come back again, we will try out the Islamic noodle everyone has been raving about in the reviews."}
{"text":"Came for the Islamic noodles. The coconut milk base was amazing. Also tried their orange chicken. It was plated in a way that made it look small, but it was surprisingly filling. Not really digging the shared seatings but chances are you'll get it if you're a small party. 

 Unbeatable price for students craving Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"RACIST!!! THIS PLACE IS RACIST! My friend and I asked for a table, and were told we had to sit at the back. We asked for one of the small tables by the window, and the host told \"all of those are for three or more\". We accepted the table at the back. 

BUT right behind us were TWO white women. The same man immediately seated them in the front window seats he refused to us. I asked him why he wouldn't give us the same seats, and he glared at us and told us to sit at the back. We were the only Black and Brown people in the restaurant. 

We were horrified and we left. Don't go here. This place has no business being in Toronto."}
{"text":"Wow, their stir fried noodles are addicting! I had the Thai basil noddles with chicle and it was absolutely amazing!  The price I guess is a little high for a cheap lunch, but the amount of food they give you totally makes up for it. It wi easily feed 2 average sized people lol. Not me :p 

Anyways this place is wicked and is definitely somehow everyone in the area should go check out!"}
{"text":"I do not go to Salad King often anymore as I am hardly in the area.  I used to live down the street a long time ago.  The new location is very nice and well decorated.  I love how you can pick your spicy level from 1 to 20.  Food itself is pretty good and portion is quite big.  Pricing is average around $10 for a plate.  The curry here is pretty good as well.  I got the green curry chicken with rice last time I was here - Around $9. 

The seating is cramp so if you are not fond of it, this might not be the place for you.  Also it gets super loud here as well.

{"text":"This slightly hard to find Thai place is on the second floor right off of Yonge Street. 
The reason I went was because of their heat scale. The heat scale was 1 to 20 where the number is the # of thai chili's added to your dishes... boom.

I tried curry dishes and stir fry dishes... they were disappointingly average at best. I really really wanted this place to be some must better. 

Bonus: Thai Islamic Noodles is unlisted dish which is basically standard pad thai  with a dollop of coconut milk curry generously ladled over top."}
{"text":"Great food, and it came within minutes after ordering it. The washrooms are really nice as well. There are about 5 or 6 individual washrooms that has a toilet and a sink."}
{"text":"I've been to this thai hot spot more times than I can really remember, And mainly for the reason that it's cheap and conveniently located near the Eaton Centre. It's great for groups that have different dietary restrictions because you can get most things vegan/vegetarian too! 

You want it spicy? They can do that for you too! you actually can choose how mild or spicy you want you dish. Which I totally appreciate because some times I like to kick it up a notch,  y'know? 

Just a note- They have mostly communal tables, so if you don't like get cozy with strangers this isn't the place for you!"}
{"text":"We came at 5:30 and it was already packed with people. Ordered chicken pad Thai and beef panang curry. Below expectations. pad Thai was too salty and sweet, not enough chicken in there. Panang curry is expected to be very rich due to peanut sauce, but the beef was too tough. not tender enough. Our server was nice."}
{"text":"only if i could give a 'no star' rating...there are other inexpensive thai food or other cheapie places to eat.

don't know if there's a review for their \"upstairs\" restaurant, but here's my experience... 
- go for lunch at 11am;
- upstairs is fairly empty except for 6 other ppl;
- i need a table for 2 and ask to sit by the window on a table tha can seat 4;
- greeter says, \"no, you can't sit there.  it's a table for 4\"    !#@%*???
- greeter directs me to sit at a table for 10 (really...small 2-seat tables joined together to make 10 seats) where the other 6 ppl sit - who are separate couples.

Bad service can NEVER make-up for quality food!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely my second favourite Thai restaurant (second to Khao San Road) in Toronto. Their portions are huge, taste is great, servers are friendly and helpful even if they aren't your designated server. 

I came on a Friday evening with some friends and waited approximately five minutes before we got seated in a booth. Our servers came with water within minutes of us sitting down. We sat comfortably in a booth which was much more spacious compared to their stainless steel seating area. We ordered a mango salad ($6.50), Islamic noodles with chicken ($11.50 - its on their secret menu), and a golden curry with beef ($10.10). Everything was ordered with medium spice as my friends aren't a huge fan of spicy foods. As per usual, the food came out shortly after we ordered and everything was delicious (and very fairly priced). I especially enjoyed the fresh mangoes they used in the mango salad. We requested the sauce and peanuts to be served on the side to accommodate our different preferences in mango to sauce and peanut ratio. I also admired their ability to have keep their meats tender as some Thai places over cook the chicken or beef which makes it less pleasant to eat. 

Overall experience was great, food was great, service was great, and it's super affordable ! I can't wait to come back again !"}
{"text":"- this new location is big. and just as loud as the old spot.
- perfect for ryerson students and exhausted shoppers from the eaton centre 
- although because of the long communal seating, and limited basket space under your seat... be weary if you are carrying a lot of gear.... it can only get worse when winter hits and the floors are soaked... 
- definitely try the khao soi (noodle soup with pickled greens in a coconut curry soup)... dont be a rookie and get a pad thai"}
{"text":"I've been to salad King 4 times! The experience was different each time... In terms of service. The first time I was there (2 years ago), service was great but the last 3 times I was there, service was very SLOW. If you're not in a rush, it's fine but if you're on a schedule, this is something you need to consider.

In terms of food, I love their stir-fry noodles! It's very delicious! But their noodle soups are very bad!! I only bought it once and ended up not finishing it... It was extremely sour. So advice here: get their stir-fry noodles or curry! Stay away from their noodle soups! 

Overall, I do recommend the place to just try out because they do have good food! But it's not my go-to food place!"}
{"text":"Y'know, it's okay. Nothing \"omg I eat here every time i'm in the Yonge/Dundas area!!\" but a pretty solid option. 

PROS:
- Pretty cheap
- Very nice modern facilities
- Loads of menu options and they are helpful with customising for those with dietary fusses.
- Communal tables are great for individuals/pairs 
- TASTY TASTY CHILLI NOMS. Ask for a pot of chili for your table too, just to add more insanity.

CONS:
- No reservations and no turning up a little early to grab a table while you wait for your dining companions
- Can sometimes take a while to get a server's attention, and the wait times for meals at lunch can be not so snappy
- I know the \"vegetable lovers\" section isn't specifically labelled vegetarian, but it would be nice to have a mention somewhere that some of these don't have the option of removing fish sauce. (A pro related to this is if you ask nicely the server will very helpfully point out what on the menu CAN have fish sauce removed to make it vegetarian).


I won't make a trip to the area specifically for this, and it's certainly not the most tastebud-blowing Thai food i've had, but it's good to have as an option in the Y&D area."}
{"text":"I have been to Salad King several times as its location is convenient and food isn't bad. Its dishes are catered to North American palettes, with extra coconut milk and sugar being common themes. Overall, its not the best Thai food around but far from the worst."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai I've ever had! (They call it phud Thai) A university hangout in a cool environment where everyone sits at long tables. The service was excellent, the portions were huge, and the prices were very low! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After what seemed like an eternity, Salad King finally re-opened up yesterday (Feb 22nd) just across the road from the old location. I went for lunch shortly after 2pm today and the restaurant was at approximately 75% capacity, leading me to believe that the lunch rush must have been sheer chaos. Insane for their 2nd day back in business. 

Is it is as good as before? Yes and No. I ordered the legendary Thai Islamic Noodles 5 Chili and my guest the Chicken Panang mild. My noodles were just as I remembered them, the same silky smooth pink coco sauce with crunchy veg and a fair amount of protein. The portion however seemed to be smaller, maybe by 10-15%. Price of the TIN is now $10.00 flat. Is it worth it? Yes, but it has steadily gone up over the past 12-13 years that I have been visiting Sking, it's as if the price of this dish increases in correlation to that of cigarettes. 

The flavour of the chicken panang sauce was outstanding and just as good as it used to be, however it was way too runny. The consistency was closer to soup and it should have been reduced way more, definitely not as runny as it used to be. The rice accompanying the panang was also in the shape of a pyramid, kinda. The entire base of the pyramid was crumbling and it simply did not look professional by any means. I could also see many other shotty pyramids passing by as staff delivered other patrons orders.  Rice portions dropped between 15% and 20% as well. Not cool 

Layout and decor of the new King is solid. Bigger and better bathrooms then before, and also an escalator to bring you to the main floor should you be unable to do so by yourself. Another great addition are the individual wooden chairs with baskets underneath, very helpful especially if you are carrying a purse or satchel (Indiana Jones carried one). 

Best thai in the city? Hell no. 
Best fast food thai in the city? Hell yes. 

Will I be back? Of course. I gotta get my Golden Curry & Thai Fried Rice fix ass well."}
{"text":"Decent Fast food style Thai"}
{"text":"Salad king?! How about salad court gesture... I remember coming here when I was in my 20's thinking wow! Love the flavours, service and style of the restaurant.

Decided to try it this evening, I highly recommend staying away from the phad Thai!! I ordered extra veggies and they said I would have to choose which ones. 
I ordered broccoli and carrots. The broccoli was over cooked and the carrots were shredded. I know the place is called salad king but shredded carrots in a cooked dish was kinda yucky... 

The only reason I'm not giving this place a lower score is the portion size, service and the cleanliness of the restaurant. 

I won't come back that's for sure... when there are so many other places that aren't afraid to add a bit of flavour to their dishes."}
{"text":"It is a busy place. The food is good though I think they use products with MGS. If you don't mind, go enjoy this institution. It is fun and fast."}
{"text":"I've been to Salad King a few times, it is always packed, but it doesnt take very long to get a seat. It is a popular Ryerson food destination. They have cafeteria style seating so you will be seated next to strangers. The chairs have little baskets underneath for your belongings. 

The food is decent, typical noodle/rice dishes with meats. The food is tasty but greasy and both times I ate their I wasnt full after eating a full plate of food. I wouldnt mind going back if I was meeting with friends, but I probably wouldnt seek out the place if I was just getting food for myself."}
{"text":"Have had a few good experiences here, and this is the type of place where most items look good, the service is pretty fast, and the prices are cheap enough, though I may take a break for a while.
I always order a curry, be it green, golden, or red. Never fails :) Lovely, coconutty, creamy, with Thai basil. The mix of flavours is lovely. I will have to try the Bangkok stir-fry next time, as a friend had it, and it looked amazing.  I have to say that the rice dishes (the meat/veggies in a long, shallow bowl with a small bowl of rice on the side) are never spectacular. The Rainbow Chicken was fine. The Basil Beef was fine. Nothing spectacular. I will have to order a stir-fry next time, though I'm not sure when I'll be back. 
I was underwhelmed by the mix of lovely peppers in the golden curry, with the unmistakable taste of frozen carrots that come out of a plastic bag in the freezer section at the grocery store. Also, it looked like the curry had been warmed in the microwave, as the sauce at the edges of the bowl had boiled. I suppose when a menu says 'vegetables', it could mean anything, and this place does cater to students, with its communal tables and bench seats with no backs, reasonable prices, loud fluorescent-coloured wallpaper, and noisy trendy atmosphere.
As well, the hostess tried to seat us beside the kitchen and did not want us to change seats when I suggested it is really loud.  We chose to sit elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is one spot where reviews don't matter. They will get packed day after day regardless of people's opinion.
The place was just slammed and we had to wait a bit. 
The noise is deafening BTW and one gets fatigued by just sitting there for a bit.
The menu is extensive and covers all the mainstream thai items and then some. 
They do substitutions which is a good thing  if you are in with a picky eater.
We decided on the following
Manago Salad
Chicken Satay
Panang Chicken
Beef with Lime Leaf
Thai Noodle Soup (Whatever that means)
I decided to kick up the spice level on the beef to 15 chilis.
The food arrived promptly. The Satay chicken was cooked well, sadly the sauce was devoid of taste.
Mango Salad was supposed to have a green mango as the main ingredient. They served a ripe one. The dressing was a mess IMO. Not balanced at all no tang whatsoever.
I didn't try the panang chicken or the soup. 
Beef was a disaster. The quality of beef was not good just thin sliced veiled with below average sauce. I mean there is an abundance of good quality of Beef in North America so why skimp. The heat was kicked up by just slathering it with chilli sauce (which was not thai to begin with) the result was one gets a mouth numbing heat at the start instead of the lingering heat that is the signature of thai food.
Prices here are reasonable. The food is a tad better than  a food court offering."}
{"text":"Always a safe choice. Food is consistently good, service is quick, and portions are big. It's very busy though. So if you're going with a group during lunch hour, you're most probably gonna wait a bit. Not sure if they take reservation. If they do, and you know that you'll go there with more than 4 people, I strongly suggest you make a reservation."}
{"text":"Nice setting and pleasant staff but the food doesn't taste like the Thai food I knew and maybe I got Thai food all wrong until I had food at Salad King.  The spicy levels were awesome."}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favourite Thai place, ever! It's delicious, it's quick and it's cheap.

I first learnt about this place years ago. I was doing a coop term near the Eaton Centre and the local lunch stop amongst my Ryerson friends was here. In and out in less than 30 mins and completely satisfied. 

Back in the day I would order their Thai green curry (beef), 3 chillies and it hit the spot. Tried and true. Then one day I tried their phud Thai, 4 chillies and holy heck I was converted. More recently I discovered their Siam noodles (chicken), think of a spicy peanut butter curry sauce over noodles. Drool. Granted, the actual physical appearance resembles something you might find at a washroom in the local bar, but the taste is incredible. If you like rice noodles, and you like peanut butter and you like curry, this is for you. You will love it. Trust me.

I once went here with a friend that ordered phud Thai, 10 chillies - yes, he is Sri Lankan. He said it was perfect spiciness for him. I can only do 3 chillies and my brow sweats. 

The seating is not the best. Half the restaurant has private tables and the other half has bench seating. You often have to sit next to strangers, but the turn over is quick. And hey, some of the conversations around you can be hilarious. 

If you haven't stopped here before, you've got to go!"}
{"text":"I had very low expectations for this restaurant coming in solely because of the name of the restaurant. Then I learned from Yelp that it was a thai restaurant and thought, \"oh that was misleading\". So remember guys, never judge a restaurant by its name. And always check them out on Yelp beforehand, in case there are secret menu items.

On my first visit I had to try the secret menu item that everyone raves about: the Islamic noodles. Not sure why it's called Islamic, but I vaguely remember reading that the ingredients may be halal. Do not rely on this though, please check with server. But lets get back to those noodles. Extremely fragrant coconut milk taste in the smooth nutty sauce with a hint of spice. Portions were also huge. Not sure if it's worth the $11 though. A slightly cheaper alternative would be the siam noodles. The sauce tastes very similar just minus the coconut and a very chunky peanut. Also if you have a serious nut allergy I would try to avoid this place. 

They also have a points card! 10 meals and you get a free meal =)

If you have a small appetite I would recommend you split an appetizer and main with a friend instead of getting 2 separate mains. Unless you want to save it for your next meal. Cause you can do that too."}
{"text":"My experience here was actually pretty good. The food was plentiful and did the trick, and the service was on point. I also liked how the bathrooms were individual and enjoyed how we were above ground-level so as to have some sort of an aerial view. Wouldn't necessarily pick this place as my go-to for Thai food, but we had a good time, well worth the visit. For 2 dishes for 2 people, the bill came to a little over $30."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend today for lunch, it was my first time eating at salad king. I had the golden curry with 10 chiles. Definitely felt the kick of the spice. The curry was nice and flavourful however the portion is a little small.  
Servers were friendly and food came in really fast. The only thing was they seemed to be in a rush to kick you out as soon as you finish. As this is a restaurant setting we were hoping to chat for a bit, but the server interrupted us to give us the bill. Was a little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner around 6pm on a Wednesday evening. The place was half empty when we arrived, but it's known to fill up quickly with the university crowd. 

We were initially going to be seated in the main bench seating area, but the server was nice enough to move us towards the windows when we kindly asked. From past experience, sitting in the bench seating area can get cramped, loud and a bit uncomfortable if you're hoping to have a private conversation (read: if you're getting to know someone on a first date while sitting in the main bench area, it can get real awkward real fast).

We ordered the Islamic Noodles with chicken (a secret menu item I've been wanting to try), and the Siam Fried Rice; both less / non-spicy.

The Islamic noodles is a pad thai with coconut curry sauce. Sauce was tasty, noodles were good, chicken not overcooked - would definitely order again.
The fried rice was your standard fare fried rice mixed with shrimp, squid, pineapple and vegetables. Pineapple and vegetables seemed fresh, but the squid had a strong fishy taste which was a bit odd - not sure if that was intentional or something else going on there. Would likely not order again.

Of the times I've eaten here, the service was always good. I think we spent nearly 1.5 hours  eating and chatting, and never felt rushed even as the busy university student crowd began pouring in later in the evening.

Overall, decent food with good service for a good price."}
{"text":"Food's not bad, great for a student hangout.  

I only dropped a star because the seating arrangement is a bit too cramped."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I won't be returning here. I have had better Thai food in the mall, and I actually got really sick to my stomach after eating here."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  Service is fine.  Not a bad experience overall. I wouldn't mind going back here for sure."}
{"text":"I really don't understand what the hype is all about.  This place is OK.  Nothing amazing.  Yes, I felt bad about the old place, and the owners had to rebuild.  They did a nice job on the decor.  However, the pad thai is mediocre at best.  I suppose the portion sizes are what keeps the regulars coming back?  The chili scale has always been a draw as well.  Service was quite disappointing.  We were trying to order as another server rudely interrupted and passed on her tables to our server in the MIDST of us speaking!  The servers had a full on conversation!  Rude.  Still looking for a half decent pad thai in the city (Sukhothai/Khao San Road would be the best so far, imho.)  Definitely don't need to go back.  Lots of people there doesn't make it THE place to be."}
{"text":"Pretty decent and reasonably priced thai menu. For people popping in for a quick meal there is always the long tables in the front area instead of having to wait for a more cozy seating. 

Their level of spiciness \"peppers\" system really do need some work - the descriptions make very little sense, and up to 15 peppers, really? Too many choices just confuse customers."}
{"text":"Im a Ryerson alumni I started visiting Salad King more than 7-8 years ago whenever it was that they first opened their doors at the old location before the building burnt down. I do miss those days. But i can't say that I don't crave SK every so often

Here's what I've learnt though in my many many visits. Their noodles are top notch but very few of the curry dishes are finger lickin' good. I dont venture out much to those. I'm a big hot food fan so the spice scale for me is the best thing anyone can ever come up with! I've hit 15 chillies and oh my.. no words. now I stick to 5 or 7 or if im feeling adventerous 10 .. depending on what I'm getting.

Try their Kari noodles - my personal fav - packed with flavour! 

I dont care what anyone has to say - my love for Salad King is never dying *insert heart here*"}
{"text":"-- My First Impression -- 

This restaurant was very close to Eaton Centre (2 mins walk from the Yonge Street Entrance). To me, Salad King is a Thai fast food restaurant. It looked like a canteen since all the tables and chairs were made of metal. Everything was so packed and squished together which didn't make me feel too comfortable. In a good way, they maximized the space so they could contain more customers during rush hour. The wait time was very short and the table turnover rate is very high. The place is very loud, it makes it very difficult to chat with your date/friends. However, the waiting time for dishes was longer than expected, which was not compatible with the restaurant operation structure. 

-- Food & Drink --

We ordered two items: 

1. Phud Thai with Chicken (medium spicy) $9.75;
- I liked how the tofu and peanuts blend in well with the rice noodles. The lime made the dish less greasy. 

2. Panang Curry with Chicken $9.75;
- This is a very sweet curry with a strong taste of coconut milk. I cannot find any peanuts in it, and I found the coconut taste too strong and sweet. 

-- Overall --

I would come back for their food given that it is so close to Eaton Centre and the price is relatively cheap compare to the other restaurants around this area."}
{"text":"Just as an update: I've ordered Salad King through Foodora a couple times now and they're attention to detail is something I really appreciate. I ordered two islamic noodles, which is on the Foodora menu guys, secret yet not so secret! They let you customize your noodles down to the type of sauce you want, eggs or no eggs and all the extra veggies you could ever want. It's amazing! 

When they package the food, it arrives very clean. The curry sauce itself is packaged in a little plastic cup which is then placed into another styrafom container to prevent any accidental leaks. The noodles come packaged separately so when you mix the sauce with the noodles, its fresh and none of the veggies have become soggy. It's small things like this I appreciate when ordering takeout, when the food arriving to your place looks extremely similar to having it at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been to Salad King several times through the years and it definitely hits the spot when I have a Thai-ish craving. This isn't authentic Thai but it will satisfy your craving without leaving a giant hole in your wallet.

The Phad Thai is delicious. The curries are tasty. The crispy spring rolls are perfect for sharing. 

Just don't order the mango salad when mangoes aren't in season.

Service here is consistent and staff seem knowledgeable about the spice levels of the dishes. Price isn't that much more than the fast food versions of westernised Thai and is so much tastier (plus quality of ingredients show).

Come here instead."}
{"text":"Been here many times but this has been the worst so far :(. Normally it is a 5 star experience but today was different. Service was quick and good; we got the sea queen and golden tofu. Golden tofu was good, as per usual,  but the sea queen was a tad undercooked. The squid didnt have the same texture and the breading was still raw. The pad thai here is also pretty good as well as the othet curries. Still would recommend to anyone in the yonge and dundas area and to anyone who wants an intro to thai food."}
{"text":"Super yummy. Golden Curry is amazing!"}
{"text":"Overly salted, cafeteria style food. Yikes!

I'm not sure why this place has such a long line up. For some reason, I expected the food to blow me away, especially when you are seated awkwardly at benches, where you can hardly hear any conversation.

We ordered the thai basil chicken and the Siam noodles. Dishes arrived quickly.
Both were way, way too salty and obviously, mass produced. 

I won't return again, even though the price seemed like a 'bargain.'  I've had much better Thai food for $10."}
{"text":"I have a feeling I might take some hits for saying this, but this place is WAY over hyped. It's crowded and cramped and the food is average at best. It's not the best Thai food in the city, it's not even the best Thai food in that area.

I'm sure if I was a poor student I'd appreciate their 'No Frills' approach to restauranting (maybe splash a few ice cubes in that water?), but frankly I was left unimpressed."}
{"text":"Had some time to kill downtown and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I was super dehyrated from work but still insisted on ordering the Tom Yum soup which was quite spicy. I also had two of the Thai Iced Teas and the spicy noodles. It was all quite amazing and fresh tasting. Service was fast and speedy. Definetly worth a try."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great if you're single or want the hustle and bustle of eating with others.  Can't say that I'm wowed by the food. Tofu dishes are almost all deep fried, and the one I had with coconut curry was not terribly inspired: no strong flavours of basil or coriander or other spicing to speak of and largely an overly rich and somewhat heavy curry.  I believe that a simple healthier approach with quality ingredients and spicing could still be done at these cheap prices, but then I guess with lineups assured no real incentive to change."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place after living nearby for a decade.  A DECADE of loving Thai food.  

These days, Toronto has great Thai options (well..maybe just Pai).  I also recently had \"fake\" Thai food at Thai Basil in Annex that I enjoyed, despite it's ketchupy fakeness.  So I am pretty lenient when it comes to my pad thai.

We did pick up of veggie pad thai, chicken basil, and spring rolls (3 to an order). 

I didn't like the tofu in the veggie pad thai, especially compared to the beautiful veggies and tofu from Pai's vegetarian pad thai.  At Thai Basil, there were no veggies or tofu or anything, really, but the sauce was much better.

The chicken basil dish, however, was good.  The rice it came with smelled really weird to me (I'm a \"super smeller\") and I couldn't eat it.  Spring rolls were very standard.  No need to revisit with all the options these days.

We got \"mild\" pad thai but it could have use some sriracha or somethin'."}
{"text":"Pad Thai. It's amazing, best I've had. Whenever I have a craving for Thai this is my go to. Never disappointed by the chicken phud Thai. Rice dishes are also quite good, mango chicken, shrimp fried rice."}
{"text":"The food is great; the portions are, well, too big; the staff was pretty friendly; I like the decor.

Sure, I was pretty hungry and a little worn out from all the walking around Toronto that day, but I don't think it made the food taste better (maybe a bit).  I wasn't sure if I could get Thai food that would taste as good (be as similar as?) as it does back home (Portland, Oregon), but I did.  I was very happy with it.

There were a couple things that seemed like small missteps to me, but not being in the area long enough, some of it may have just been regional.  All in all, I'd be very happy to go back here anytime."}
{"text":"Their Mango salad is really pretty, refreshing and delicious! It's a nice app to share between 2 people.

Their sea queen (squid) can be a hit or miss."}
{"text":"For this price range and level of service I can't think of a better Thai place in Toronto! They moved down the street onto Yonge (after the last building collapsed and it was closed for ages, which made me very sad) so don't be confused by the location/exterior photos on Yelp (the address is correct, and it's now upstairs). The flavour of their curries and sauces are amazing, full bodied and well rounded, and the fact that you can customize your spicy level is perfect (my boyfriend is a wimpy when it comes to spice, so its nice we can both enjoy what we like). The service is always quick and friendly, and they've taken it up a style notch (including in the washrooms) at the new location. They still have the shared cafeteria style bench seating as a large part of the restaurant, which I think is a great use of space and fun (although I've heard others complain...you can always wait for a 'regular' table).  There are downsides, but I'm willing to live with all of them for the great food and a great price. They don't deliver - when I lived in the 'hood I'm sure I would have single handedly given them enough business to make doing so worthwhile ;) Also, during the Ryerson school year it gets crazy at lunch, and on weekends you can sometimes have to wait awhile for a table. Also sometimes I find that they aren't consistent with their spice scale. I usually get 3 or 5 chillies depending on my mood and the dish (ie does it come with white rice) but sometimes it seems more or less spicy...but again a gamble I'll take any day here!"}
{"text":"Its just great so great
Love it!"}
{"text":"Average spot to grab a quick Thai meal. It's great for groups and people tend to eat fairly quickly so even if it's busy it will clear out fast. I ordered the panang chicken curry dish with medium spice and I'm sad to say it nearly took my head off - I have suspicious feeling that there was more spice than I asked for nevertheless I ate it all anyway. The portions are a decent size and the food arrived promptly after we ordered. Prices range between $9 - 12 for a meal.  I would pay a couple extra bucks and head to Pai instead, but it's not bad for a quick meal if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Too big for their britches.

Salad King used to be amazing. I don't mean last year or the year before, because at that point, they had been on their way to suck-age for a while. I mean that 10 years ago, they were the best place in the city to go and get a bowl of kill-me hot Tom Goong Kai Soup.  And the soup would actually leave me breathless after ordering a 20.The Pad Woon Sen was some of the best I'd had and overall, the value was outstanding.

Then they renovated, and got the communal table thing happening. The value was still decent, but the portions and quality dropped a little. Still, it was they only place that would actually make things hot enough for me, and the food was decent. At least at this point, they could still seat people within a reasonable amount of  time and bring you the right food.

Slowly, the portions became smaller and the quality and value decreased.

At their current location on Yonge St, the suck-age is immense. I'm sad to say that I don't want to eat here ever again. The last time I tried to visit we waited for 15 minutes and no one even greeted us. They weren't busy. I get that someone may have called in sick, but really? Just say hello and acknowledge that there are people at the door. We ended up walking out.

The time before that they messed up our order, bringing me food that wasn't even what I ordered (scary, because I always order my food 20, so I pity da fool they brought  my actual food to.) I had to wait 20 minutes for a new order and my boyfriend was already close to finishing his when they brought me the re-do, which wasn't really THAT hot. At least not 20 hot.

The prices have been raised by almost a third on some items, from what they originally were, which I get-- overhead + inflation and the like, but the quality has been driven so far downhill that I can't justify spending my money there anymore.

Salad King is a place that is a victim of their own success, but they'll probably still turn a profit being close to Ryerson. Most students aren't as picky as an old hag with a rabid need for chilies, like myself."}
{"text":"Access
It used to be around the corner where Ryerson is but since the fire, it is now hidden in the second/third floor of a building. Just walk north from Eatons and you will see the sign Salad King right before you hit Elm Street. Otherwise, just use google maps.

Service
They are super fast, and I love how they refill my water. Gosh, you don't know how difficult it is to have a restaurant that regularly refills your water without being asked. They function like a fast food chain, zoom zoom baby.

Food

They have some signature dishes and behold, even a secret menu (reminds me of Starbucks). Before you order, make sure to look on the right (or maybe left) of their paper menu. It will list the level of spiciness - beginning with medium and gradually increasing with the number of peppers. I typically don't go more than 1 pepper but if you like adventure, please try it out yourself.

Golden Curry with Chicken
They have 3 different types of curry, with golden curry being their best seller. Now at medium spicy level, it tastes more sweet than hot. I think that's due to the coconut milk and my dad experienced a sour taste as well. I say it's a safe way to go and I love how they stack their rice into a pyramid shape lols.

Thai Noodle Soup
Average at best, this thing tasted so bland. It's not one of their signature dishes - though it didn't taste horrible, I would move on. You could do a better job cooking at home.

Seafood Fried Rice 
I have a feeling that portion sizes have shrunk but the quality is still top notch. Finally, rice that tastes good and doesn't crumble. Furthermore, they add lots of seasoning to the rice and their squid is mmm yummy. Not too chewy, not too soft. This is one dish I always go back to when I visit Salad King.

Not a bad restaurant for Thai food and the prices are fair. I really hate sitting where the long tables are because frankly, where the hell am I going to put my big jacket and purse? Other than that, the restaurant is quite consistent with their quality though it is nothing to praise about."}
{"text":"Clean, not so expensive and flavourful. The service is decent and the portion is quite filling! if you cannot handle spice, do not worry, you can adjust the spice level, but be careful if you have but allergies, sometimes they serve peanut spread or crumbled nuts to ease down the spiciness. atmosphere is casual and great for groups."}
{"text":"What I like:
Great food. Great selection. Fast service. Decent Prices. Can choose your level of spice/chilli
I stumbled across this place with a friend of mine, and have been coming back ever since. Really enjoy my thai food and this is one of the better places in Downtown Toronto. I also like that you can chose how many chills they put in your food. 

What I don't like:
The cafeteria style seating isn't the best. There is literally always a line up (but i guess thats good!) And they have very short working hours."}
{"text":"Always crowded! But considering the cheap price with generous portion, everything makes sense. Unlike other Thai restaurants, this place is decorated in a more modern way. I like their colourful ceilings.

The food there is good too. I've had Phud Thai and Kari noodles, both were yum. Oh their chicken satays were so soft and juicy."}
{"text":"This place has become an icon over the years as a go-to spot for Ryerson and UofT students downtown! The problem is that the quality of the food has gone from solid beginnings to a pathetic shadow of its former self.

I noticed long ago that most dishes at this place are made from a batch of the exact same ingredients but with different sauces for different flavours. This is fine, it's part of their industrial approach to producing food fast, economically, and once upon a time, good too. If you look at their menu, most items list the same set of ingredients but they have been sneaky by listing those ingredients in different orders per item. That's all fine as long as the food is good.

Over my last half dozen orders from this place during the last year or so, I have started to notice that they are including less and less vegetables, less meat, and more noodles. More concerning is that our different orders are becoming indistinguishable from each other. So basically, these days it doesn't matter what you order, you'll get the same thing!

Our perfect example. My wife ordered Phud Thai noodles and I ordered Siam Noodles. As you'll see from the picture I've uploaded, you cannot see any difference between our orders other than that mine came with peanut sauce. When we taste tested the two orders, we couldn't tell the difference. It's really sad, to be honest. Particularly for a place as iconic as this! The Phud Thai doesn't even resemble Phud Thai from any other place.

There used to be another Thai fast food place farther north on Yonge years ago called Green Mango. The place was AMAZING! I have no idea why Green Mango closed because they were a huge success and I dream of their food to this day. Salad King used to fill in the gap but now this place isn't worth ever returning to.

My wife and I have both declared Salad King dead to us. Sorry Salad King, I suspect your days are numbered if you don't return to your quality roots."}
{"text":"Never again ! 

I walked in and waited for about 30 minutes as I watched everyone else who came in after me (even in my section) get served.

I got up and decided to leave --but before I do I decided to notify the manager of the poor service. After telling her about the wait and ignorance by the staff.. She starts making excuses about how the girl in the section went on break..( but they were serving the others in my section ?) 
Then she tells me --if i go and sit back down she'll  take it now (she didn't apologize yet) 

After I told her no it's okay I'm just going to go somewhere else .. She turns around and tells me I'm never welcomed here again.. Lol what ?! 

How are you a manager ?! 

No apologizing nothing -- 

making excuses that doesn't make sense cause those people served were right next to me in My section 

then you tell a customer they aren't welcome back because they're just letting you know about your poor service ? 

Sad. Very sad salad king"}
{"text":"This is for me, by far, the best Thai restaurant I've ever tried. Food is really good and have very good price. I've tried most of the plates in the menu but still can't find something better that the hot Thai noodles w/chicken and shrimp (3 chilies) :)"}
{"text":"I was vegetarian at the beginning of this year so I ordered the chop suey that came with steamed white rice. The chop suey looked like it was reheated leftovers... it was definitely not worth $9.50. And the rice was cold and not even heated up...wtf. 
So if you're a vegetarian/vegan, DO NOT go to salad king for their \"veggie lover\" options because you might as well eat left overs...smh"}
{"text":"Salad king is my go to place every time I'm hungry roaming around downtown Toronto! I am pretty sure at this point I've tried everything on the menu and everything is extremely well prepared, tasty and cheap!!! Service is always fast and great! Never had any complaints! Amazing spot to have lunch/dinner with a bunch of people or even alone! Cannot wait to go back there!"}
{"text":"I've been tempted by the intriguing title of this restaurant for over a year. \"Salad\" King, but Thai food? How curious...

Before I ventured into tasting the restaurant's fare I had inquired with my peers as to their experiences. Salad King was not necessarily to be compared with the likes of Sukho Thai or Khao San Road (which play in the \"sophisticated\" or slightly upscale arena) but was a \"you get what you pay for\", \"student-friendly\" name. I found this was largely true. I ordered the famous Islamic Noodles dish (another curiosity: I would love to hear about which staff meeting years ago may have engendered this choice of name) and it was as I would expect for any restaurant in a student hub - huge portions, decent price. The sauce is peanutty and I quite liked it. The noodles on their own aren't bad either. I cannot say I was blown out of the water, but hey, I liked it. My slight grievance though was with the vegetables - for whatever reason I didn't feel the sauce paired as well with them as they did with the noodles.

All around though, it's not a bad choice, especially (I would imagine) for Ryerson students in search of low-key Thai food between classes."}
{"text":"It's a place I've come back to consistently over the years and here's why:

The food is delish and filling. I'm always in and out in time for whatever I have planned afterward.  The student vibe makes me nostalgic for the good ol' uni days.  It's loud with communal seating, and it doesn't pretend to be anything other than one it is - inexpensive dining striving to move as many customers as possible through the doors.  The green curry is good with anything.  The Phud Thai is a good noodle choice though I've had better.  

A consistent fave:
Garlic Shrimp served with rice.  Honestly, one of the most surprising dishes at this place.  I had instinctively cringed when I first saw the listing for 'breaded shimp', expecting some heavily done up puny shrimp with an inch of deep fried flour coating each side.  How wrong I was!  What arrived was a generous serving of large shrimp lightly coated in a tangy sauce.  A must try!"}
{"text":"The Islamic noodles aren't offered on the new menu anymore but they're what I always come back for. I tried something new this time around with Vermicelli and was not disappointed. Anything with coconut curry added with some shrimp is always a popular one. And round of your meal with their mango rice dessert and your stomach will be satisfied. 

Honestly how can you go wrong when the food is great, service is better, and the most expensive thing on the menu is $10.50?"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is neat. Food is pretty good. Staff are very nice. There are lots of choices and you can decide how spicy you want each dish. We had someone in our party who is gluten free and there were plenty of options for her. 

The food came quickly and at the same time, always a bonus. Will be back if I'm in the area looking for cheap, quick Thai food."}
{"text":"It was busy on a Friday night but was quickly seated ( less than 5 minute wait) Water was given right away. Ordered Thai Ice Tea, Crispy Spring Rolls, Hot Thai Noodles and Pineapple chicken. Drinks and the spring rolls came out fast. Drinks tasted great and the spring roll was great too. The food soon came afterwards. The chicken in the pineapple dish was a little dry, but besides the chicken it was tasty. The noodles was flavorful and yummy. Service was great! Will come again to try out some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place for some hot Thai noodles!  When you eat in its a very different atmosphere. Mess hall style dining with long metal tables and stools. Cheap and delicious food. Generous servings and always piping hot. They serve Thai beer, ice cream and teas. The spring rolls and pad Thai are also honorable mentions but for me it's all about those HOT THAI NOODLES with chicken !"}
{"text":"It's extremely busy for a rather small place! It's definitely meant more for groups as the tables are long. Kinda awkward when there's only two of us and they just squished us between two groups. Just thought it would be nice if the server asked if that was ok before doing that.

I ordered the khao soi and crispy spring rolls. Khao soi tasted good, the coconut milk curry soup base really hit the spot! They had a fair amount of chicken and the egg noodles were perfectly cooked. 

The crispy spring rolls were your average vegetable spring rolls. Maybe bigger and crispier. Oh and there was fish sauce which made the dish 10x better haha.

Overall, it's better to go as a larger group. They have decent Thai food and a good selection."}
{"text":"Yum, I LOVE Salad King!  Their food is flavorful as long as you don't load up on too many chili peppers where you can't taste your food anymore.  I used to think I could handle my spice but I can only go up to 2 chili peppers...the scale goes up to 20!!!  It's also very reasonably priced.  My favorite is the seafood fried rice."}
{"text":"5 chills = I died. For those of you who can't handle your spice, anything higher than 3 chills might make you best friend with the toilet. I approve the curry dishes and the pad thais. Oh and the mango salad."}
{"text":"I am almost sure every Ryerson student has been here before, and there is a reason for that. Salad King is very consistent with their proportions and taste unlike some other restaurants. 

I am a regular here as the food does not keep me bloated and thirsty like many restaurants that price their foods at around this price, and this probably means that Salad King does not use much MSG. 

Personally my favourite dishes are the stir fry noodles although I don't feel like there is enough quantity for it's price. I never am really fully satisfied because although the food itself is very good, I am unable to be full from their food proportions whether it be noodles or curry with rice (which leads me into my next point). The curry with rice is immensely disproportionate. Unless I am somehow eating it wrong there is honestly not enough rice to even finish a quarter of the curry, unless you completely drench the rice. The taste of the golden curry is phenomenal but I am always forced to order extra rice with the curries, or extra noodles for the stir-fry dishes (which I don't recommend, they do not add any extra sauce which in turn makes the noodles lose its rich flavour - can't blame them though, I really only am paying for the extra rice/noodles).

Overall this place has really great food and service, although I am never satisfied with the proportions thus it deserves a 4-star."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, contemporary cafeteria feel and look, good Kari noodles...who needs the crazy long-wait Khao San Road? I don't. 
Give me Salad King anytime for fast service, decent food, real Thai spice levels and super central location"}
{"text":"Not impressed. 

Showed up a little before they opened (10 minutes) and were shown into a waiting area. Dining room was ready to go, they could have sat us and taken our drink orders. 

Server was friendly enough but awkward somehow. I asked for a mango smoothie with a double shot of vodka in it and her response was \"We don't do doubles...\" along a judgmental face that I wanted an alcoholic beverage with my lunch. I made a remark to my co-diner about how I didn't understand that they didn't \"do doubles\" as you can just punch in the sale of two vodka shots in the POS... She overheard, came back and said they could do it. 

Once I got my drink, it was fine. 

Ordered mango chicken. Came in a decently large portion with a side of rice but left much to be desired... The chicken was those little giblet pieces, not appetizing... I'd rather pay more for real chicken. Rice was undercooked. Vegetables were soft. End up mushing everything around in the mango sauce and shoving it down my gullet and washing it down with my drink. 

As a side note - slightly odd for a place called 'Salad King' to only have 2-3 choices for salads..."}
{"text":"Hmm, I really enjoyed the food at Salad King during the summer (although not authentic) but I can't say the same for what I had last week. This may have been because it was boxing day and it was extremely busy because many restaurants were closed that day. Service was however good!

My friends and I ordered the green mango salad, thai basil noodles, panang curry, and mango sticky rice. The flavours that I experienced before were not there and the food wasn't that great. Most dishes were OK and didn't come out that hot. Additionally, the rice that came with the curry was not fully cooked. The mango sticky rice was probably the best part of the meal. 

It's unfortunate because I enjoyed my visit during the summer. Hoping that it was a one day thing!"}
{"text":"Amazing pad thai! The tofu being fried is a nice touch that I haven't seen before. 

The spring rolls are just average but the pad thai is a real winner and it comes at a super reasonable price. Large portion too! Most times I share with someone and we both end up satisfied.

It is nice when you end up at a table, but when you get seated at the lunchroom style benches near the kitchen the noise becomes quite loud and you are seated rather close to other people."}
{"text":"This place gets really busy so I would recommend coming here early to get a seat. 
This must be a hotspot for Ryerson students. This is a decent thai place with reasonable prices and large portions. 

I usually opts for the Siam Noodles because I love how flavourful the coconut milk and peanut sauce over rice noodles taste. 

I have also had the Kao Soi - which isn't my favourite because it is lacking flavour and the soup feels watered down. (Sukho Thai has the best Kao Soi). 

The mango salad also isn't my favourite - it is lacking flavour in the sweet and spicy dressing. 

Overall if you are looking for decent thai food but you don't want to travel to some of the more popular thai joints in the downtown core, stop by Salad King."}
{"text":"Came for a late dinner around 10 PM, and there was still quite a lot of people.

I was looking at the shop signs and headed towards the Salad King sign, but then someone called out and said I already passed the entrance. Oops.

Eating at salad king feels like eating at a cafeteria. Everyone's sitting on large tables arranged in rows, with strangers beside you. Well, that's if you're seated at that half of the restaurant. The other half of the restaurant feels like you're in a cafe. It's quite a design really.

Apparently there are some off-menu items, but I just went with what's on the menu.
What you'll notice is that prices are cheaper than some other thai places like sukho or KSR or pai. Perhaps this is catered towards a student budget, given that they offer 20% off for ryerson students.

I ordered the thai noodle soup. It felt like eating pho given that it uses similar ingredients, but I found that with 5-chilis it wasn't all that spicy. Perhaps because it is a soup item, or maybe 5 isn't really that spicy. There wasn't much flavour in the noodles though, which is unfortunate.

The portions of all the dishes are pretty good, despite the lower prices.
Perhaps noodle soup isn't the best choice here."}
{"text":"This place used to be a favourite back in the day ie. at the old location before it burned down. After trying this location when it first opened and noticed higher prices for watered down food, I never came back again. So one day I randomly decided to try it out again to reminisce about the good old days. 

Ordered the Islamic noodles. These noodles are pretty good for the price and portion you receive. I get it with shrimp because the chicken here can't be chicken (it's so overly processed that it scares me). The noodles are stir fried and have a nice smokey flavour and then it's doused with a creamy peanut-y curry. This is the only thing I'll order here because it's really a hit or miss with the rest of the items. And it's usually a miss."}
{"text":"This place is usually packed so better to reserve or go at not a peak time. Pretty much everything on the menu is delicious. Must try the Pad Thai and any of the Currys. Quick service. Once I had a hair in my curry and they apologised and gave me my meal for free. Not at intimate place to eat, gets very loud during peak times. Shared tables if you come in twos."}
{"text":"standard thai.  great communal table setup, make reservations or you'll be waiting a looong time."}
{"text":"So let's compare the not-so-new location now to the old one across the street!

The old location was smaller, had a second floor which was hardly ever open and although it was well known to the college crowd the place never seem to get neither as packed nor as loud as the new location. Which in a way it is a shame. Since as other Yelpers mentioned, almost everyone's half-brother's cousin's, mother's aunt has come here.  

In general the not-so-new Salad King has lost some charm, as the venue, tried to at least look a tad more upmarket after the renovation yet SK continued with the cafeteria seating concept. The fact is you can't make cafeteria eating classy, you can try to make it fun (Guu?) but classier? Nope. As such the renovation, although not bad, seems to have been a bit of a misstep, which undoubtedly was done to maximize seating space.  

Granted they are some tables sprinkled around the ends of the floor but since the whole place is open concept, get ready for a really noisy lunch, worse for dinner... louder than what you would find at a mall's food court, since at least those tend to be a lot larger. 

Price-wise it is not too bad. If I do drop by, I generally go for a super spicy (10+) curry or pad Thai which are okay, although most importantly, they are filling. Service is fast if utterly indifferent and the food seems to be consistent. 

Remember, when you come to Salad King, you are no longer going for a hole in the wall, you are going to a loud, arguably not bad looking venue and to have one unhealthy meal. 

Their pad Thais although tasty, are very salty and I assume not very healthy. I have had some of their other dishes and again, they are not bad, but I have had better.

The biggest draws for Salad King is their location (for a local) and somewhat student-friendly prices. However with an increase of better quality, healthier and \"almost\" equally priced Thai places, Salad King has lost some of its lustre. Not because it is a terrible place, it is not, the bar simply has been raised by competition like Sukhothai and Khao San Road.

And it goes without saying, the place does not specialize in Salads. ;-)"}
{"text":"Salad King has good food and a great vibe. The place is spacious and it's a good restaurant to eat and have few drinks."}
{"text":"Location: 340 Yonge Street Toronto ON M5B 1R8 (near the Eaton Centre)
Price:$-$$
Service: Good

Many of my friends have said this place is delicious.. When I heard the name I thought it was a vegan place and it would only serve salad- little did I know it was a Thai restaurant. Warning the spices are real. I love my spice and 4 chillies hit the spot. 

Portions were decent size and if you really wanted share it would be enough. The Phad Thai was delicious and the spices were true to the spice scale! I was amaze because most of the time the spice scale doesn't do justice... One of the special dishes that's not on the menu is Islamic noodles. Über delicious- you can taste the coconut flavour and it is heaven. Truly heaven. 

The service was really good. Our servicer frequently came back to check on us. On a side note; the aura of the place is great. Love the colours and the setting of the restaurant. Glad I visited, the only reason it got a 4 out of 5 because I wasn't really blown out of the water. The food was definitely great but it's not superb fantastically amazing. Don't get me wrong it is a place I would totally recommend to others for sure- just not a 5.

Verdict: GO now!"}
{"text":"I come to Salad King once in a blue moon because I know the food isn't especially healthy, but I am always very happy with what I order and the service that comes with it.

I went in yesterday for vegetarian pad thai (which they list as phud thai; potato, potahto) with extra tofu ($1.50 extra but worth it), and received it in under 5 minutes. The spice level perfectly matched my 1 chili order. It was steaming hot and delicious, and served with a lime, fresh cilantro, chopped peanuts, and enough noodles to serve one and a half of me.

My server was fantastic, and I've actually never had bad service here. He stopped a couple of times to make sure I had everything I needed.

I really like the atmosphere but it is definitely not suited for reading alone. It is very loud during the lunch rush because it's so popular. Even so, I have never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a spot to sit. Be prepared to potentially get friendly with strangers, as the long tables mean that you could be seated next to someone you don't know. This, along with the colourful decor, is all part of the experience.

A couple of tips: If you use the basket under your seat, don't forget  what you put in there when you leave! And of course, check out the washrooms. They're pretty great."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times because it is so convenient to my work. The prices are reasonable, the service is fine, and the decor is colourful and casual.
Some of the noodle dishes are very good, but the curries and stir frys are just disappointing - not the tastiness I would expect from thai food at all. The papaya salad is terrible. 
They have a 'chilli rating' where you can up the spice, but for people who like it really hot (not me, but friends I've dined here with) it just doesn't deliver- the max (20 chillis) is just not that hot."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Phud Thai ($9.25) for dinner and the portion size was huge. I only ate half of it and had the rest the next day for lunch. Overall, it was decent tasting and worth it's price. Not too oily, not too saucy, not too dry, and not too bland. In fact, I can't really put a finger on anything about it that was bad. At the same time however, I can't point out anything that was exceptionally good.

If I were craving Thai food, I guess I would consider coming here again. I do wish that they offered smaller portions for a cheaper price though. Nothing tastes as good after a night of refrigeration."}
{"text":"I went here last weekend first time after they moved to the new location. 
I already liked them before and that didn't change after my last visit.

the place is very nicely decorated.
most of the seating area consists of communal dining tables (as it was in the previous location) but there is also a very cute separate seating area on one end of the floor with smaller tables for smaller groups (2-4ppl)

also extra note - the stools in the communal area have a basket underneat them when you can store a purse/bag/cloths. very very convenient.

the service is super fast so it's a great location to go to when you're on the run. 

the food is yummy (mmm bean noodles!), the menu has lots of veg options and there are 8 levels of spiciness you can choose from (level 5 is mildly spice so go for it!)

AND they bring separate bills!"}
{"text":"Take-out for Saturday night hibernation with my sweetheart.  Call ahead and get a nice walk to pick up delicious food.  Bangkok stir fry is my standby.  It tastes so light and flavourful that I do not realize I have eaten the whole serving.  Spring rolls are crispy and plump with vegetables.  Green mango salad is tart and julienned perfectly so it is almost noodle like to eat.  The chicken cases was good but nothing to sing home about.  Will definitely come back here and grab the curry instead.  Great, quick, inexpensive standby."}
{"text":"People tend to rave about this place, but I only just got around to going.  I had high expectations because of all the hype, but it actually lived up to them pretty well.  

Very busy at lunch, but despite the line up we got seated in about ten minutes.  Managed to get a spot in the corner, so it wasn't too loud despite the crowd.  I was pleased with my green curry, though it wasn't as spicy as I would have liked.  Next time I'll remember to order it spicier.  

All and all, I'll definitely go back.  In the sea of sub-par chain restaurants at Yonge and Dundas this is a spot to remember."}
{"text":"Good Thai food, not great, but a pleasant place
pretty reliable, and many things are good, curries are a good choice

Mango salad is desultory and terrible"}
{"text":"Loved the Islamic noodles. Not on the menu. Lots of seating. On the second floor. Not halal but enough vegetables options."}
{"text":"I met a gf here for dinner.
You have to walk up a set of stairs. There is also an elevator. 
Service was quick and attentive. Food arrived quickly. 
We ordered seafood curry, spring rolls, and a chicken curry.
Everything was flavourful and well portioned.
A lot of communal tables and students.
I would definitley come here again. The price of the dishes are affordable."}
{"text":"Salad king almost feels like a fast food joint instead of a restaurant. At times it almost feels like your suppose to get up and order at the front as the servers were more busy interacting with each other than customers. 

The food was great! I got the pad thai chicken which is one of the best I've had in town and you get to pick the spice level you want. We sat on a long bench where there were no place to put your jackets. 

Id recommend this place to others who are in the downtown area looking for thai food."}
{"text":"PROS: Flavourful food; generous portions for the price; super fast service; casual atmosphere; good for eating alone and couples (literally, 2 people)

CONS: not the most comfortable chairs; communal tables would be problematic if the restaurant were busy (I.e. too loud because too close to neighbouring customers);"}
{"text":"I love this place when i go down town to do some shopping. Tiger Beer is great . I never go over 4 chilli's. Noodles are well portioned and two people can easily share one order!! GREAT FOOD if you are a fan of truly spicy food."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5 for its value. The food is pretty damn good for the price you pay for it. I usually get their sea queen, pad Thai, or Islamic noodles. Being full and satisfied at a restaurant with good quality food for $15 a major win for me.

Being able to control the spice level is great too because I am normally biased towards spicy food. I get 10 spice levels if I want to chill and 15 if I want a bit of kick to my food . 20 is overboard for me where I can't enjoy the food itself."}
{"text":"I like the food here... a lot.
Have you ever gotten sad at the end of a meal because it was over?  This is how I feel when I go here.  BUT the service is sub-par (goodbye star #1), and the rice-to-meal ratio is also off (goodbye star #2), but besides that, YUM!

I've had the Phud Thai and the Green and Panang Curry - all excellent...except for the rice to meal ratio."}
{"text":"Busy place, but shows how good their food is. I ordered the mango chicken curry and it was delicious. It came with rice and was soooooo good. Portion sizes are good too. You can get a good meal for about $10. The servers come and check on you regularly even though it's almost always packed. Good place for uni students!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is huge, and nicely decorated, very clean, and I love the bag holder under the chair. It has a really modern feel. I recommend this place for family or a large group of friends. Prices are ok, especially for the serving size. Service is pretty fast, and our server was friendly. The food itself was alright, nothing memorable, and doesn't come close to other authentic Thai food  I've had."}
{"text":"Khao soi, pad thai (phud thai), and golden curry are good dishes. Spring rolls were a bit too salty. Papaya salad didnt have enough fish sauce and dried shrimp so it was plain/bland."}
{"text":"I first came here thinking that this restaurant were known for their salads, hence the name Salad King.  I was so wrong.. It's Thai Food!  Once you go in and go up the flight of stairs, you walk in and this place is usually extremely busy.  There is usually a line up to be seated and they have benches where you sit with randoms, which I feel is too close for comfort sometimes.  But on the other side, if you are lucky, you get the booth seats.  I find it's quite loud and the customer service could be a bit better, but like I always say the ambience and the customer service is always an added bonus.  I've been here a hand full of times, I've tried their Crispy Spring Rolls, Golden Curry with Rice, Hot and Sour Shrimp (Tom Yum Goon) soup, Hot and Soup Mushroom (Tom Yum) soup, and Phud Thai.  The presentation of their food is nice and the taste is delicious from what I've tried.  The price point is affordable and the portion sizes are decent for what you pay for.  I have yet to try their Mango Sticky Rice! Maybe next time I visit I will save some room for dessert.  I'll try it eventually. It's a nice restaurant to go to if you like spice in your food, as you can have as many as 1 to 20 chilis.  I've only had 1-2 chilis, I don't dare to try any hotter, as my tolerance for spicy foods are not the highest.  Anytime you're have cravings for Thai food and I'm in the downtown area, I'd recommend checking out Salad King.. It's in the heart of downtown Toronto, what more is there to ask."}
{"text":"Keep in mind - this is casual, quick (at times) thai food! Mainstream! I'd describe this as Chipotle level thai food. It not the best but portions are good and you get pretty decent bang for the buck! Protip: Islam noodles! #secretmenu. I'd describe this dish as pad thai with a rich coconut curry, but not like the khao soi where its noodles in a curry soup. Def recommend to try it if you head there. Everyone knows the chili system now right? from mild to 20? FYI doe, 10 chilis in a curry dish is not as spicy as something say, 10 chilis fried rice, as they fry the chilis and it gets hotter that way. 

It ain't sukhothai or pai, but gets the job done at a good price point!"}
{"text":"Most people would probably miss the entrance for Salad King if it was their first time. 
At first, I was expecting a large restaurant, probably the size of the Panera ahead. 
I came here in the afternoon (around 3pm) and the place was pretty empty. My friends and I sat beside the window and dined while looking onto Yonge Street. 
I loved the seating arrangement and how the restaurant felt casual yet kind of fancy. This place is perfect for any occasion, even a date. [One of my friends was already thinking about having a date here....and was definitely fond of the prices aha]
For four people, we ordered 2 dishes because we were tasting all sorts of food that day (just before this, we had burgers and ice cream). 
They were veggie pad thai and a seafood dish which name i do not recall. Out of all my friends that day, I would be the \"weakest\" when it comes to spice therefore, we ordered everything either regular/mild/medium. 
I was surprised that the dishes were able to keep their flavour without having spice overpower it. Although we were dying for water afterwards, the servers kept us hydrated for the majority of our stay.
I vividly remember one waiter coming over at least every 6 minutes. One time, he accidentally missed the cup while pouring and caused a minor spill. It was not bothersome however, he returned to wipe down the spill. 
I am leaving this review at 4 stars for now because I would like to return one more time to confirm my stance."}
{"text":"Decently good. Great location. great Decor.

Yeah the food can be really spicy, but there are other ways to make food good other than just spicing it up. I think that was severely lacking from this place."}
{"text":"The dish to try is \"Islamic noodles with shrimp\" which is not on the menu so you just ask the waiter for it. This dish is amazing! 

Their green curry is also good and other dishes are ok.  DO NOT order salad here, I'm not sure why it has salad in the name but definitely not a good place to have a salad. This restaurant is mostly filled with university students as it has really affordable prices. It's also close to Dundas Square so it's in a great location."}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot for Islamic Noodles.  Always 15 chili's based on thier spicy scale  always leave happy!"}
{"text":"I've probably passed by this place a hundred times thinking it's a vegetarian place. Major thanks to my friend who told me this is a Thai restaurant. Since I was introduced to this place, I've revisited again 2 more times. It's now firmly in my heart as my default Thai place.

It's hard for a restaurant to get more popular than this. Even on a weekday night, the restaurant seems almost full. They must be doing something right. After visiting, I think so too. They do take out which might be tempting when they are full. Just remember to get water from somewhere if you can't take spicy food well.

If you do sit down, remember that this isn't really a place for a quiet upscale dinner. The main area is like a school cafeteria. During busy hours, you are almost guaranteed to be sitting next to a stranger, similar to Wrvst. They do have some \"normal\" seating but they are for larger groups. 

Pros:
-Decent value. Around $9 per dish pre-tax. At this price level, you can forget Thai Express! 
-Decent portion! Especially when you consider the price. 
-Fast service. They clearly can consistently manage even full capacity.
-A rewards card. Buy 10 meals and get 1 free!
-Food tastes awesome! Authentic? Maybe I've never been to Thailand but Salad King is good for me! Some Thai places I've tried tasted like Chinese stir fry! 
-Can choose level of spiciness. 

Cons:
-I can't think of anything else. I wished they have another location closer to me.

All pros and no cons? 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I came here with my fellowship for dinner last month. Located up a set of stairs, I wouldn't have known the restaurant was there unless my friends had told me. Inside, it was set up (at least to me), like a cafeteria with rows of benches and long tables. The interior looked neat, clean, and urban. 

The food was great! I tried my curry with minimal spice because I know I can't handle spicy food, and I loved how it tasted. My friend got the seafood fried rice and shared some with me. It was great! I hadn't really tried Thai food up until then, so this was a good food experience to my taste buds. 

I won't be coming here regularly because of the busyness which slightly turns me away (sometimes the wait time to get a table can be extensive without a reservation, but it goes to show the place is popular) and price tag but I recommend that every Ryerson student (since it's right by school) should try Salad King (and Chipotle, Five Guys, Panera, Bam Nhi Boys etc) at least once. If you go to school/work in the area, you got to experience the food here!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Salad King was just last evening and it lasted about 25 minutes.  3 fellow Yelpers who I know had checked in just minutes before and since I was in the area I thought I would surprise them by just popping in and invading their space.  Oh wait hey, since I'm here let's get something quick to eat as well.

They serve food pretty fast here.  My friends' food had already come to the table and I've barely taken my jacket off.  I had ordered a quick chicken phud thai and I was assured by one of my friends that it would come quickly.  Perhaps not even 5 minutes went by and the food was in front of me.  I had asked for \"5\" chili level of hot.  5 being considered medium.  

This level of heat was much lower than I'm used to to the point I wish I had one of those little pepper dispensers to add some heat but our table didn't have one but there was one behind us but I didn't notice it until afterwards.

The noodles were of a decent portion size and the food was ok.  The chicken wasn't too generous but overall the dish was fine.  I would have liked to have had it hotter but now I know for next time.  After tax the bill came out to just over 11 bucks.  Not that expensive for a quick dinner.

The other meals my friends had looked look decent and while this place is practically fast food it's still a sit down place and it looked pretty busy.  In the end the food is decent, and it's not that expensive and the service seemed quick... this is why the experience only lasted a good 25 minutes and we even sat and rested for a little bit of time too before leaving."}
{"text":"I will keep this short and sweet , Great food low price ! great tasting and authentic Thai food ok not as cheap as getting it on the streets of Bangkok but pretty cheap for this part of the world . Whenever I am up in Toronto I stop in for the massaman curry , try it you'll like it :)"}
{"text":"Great and cheap Thai food. I typically get the Chicken Panang (7 chilies) and Siam Noodles (5 chilies) and split with my friend. Love the Panang curry and the peanut sauce on the noodles is heavenly! Can't go wrong with either dish and the price can't be beat! It's my go to Thai restaurant :)"}
{"text":"I call this place weeks before a certain event saying if I can book a table for 8, they tell me they don't do group reservations past 5 pm on weekends, HOWEVER the guy on the phone told me I can show up and reserve the table for 8 while my friends show up because they're all coming from out of town. So the day comes, I'm with a friend and I request a table for 8, the person told me they couldn't do that. I explain to them how I called multiple times before to make sure I can do so and the person who I talked with said it was okay to do so, and they kept denying that anyone has said that? I got into a huge argument with them and saying how ridiculous it was that they it was such a ridiculous notion even when there were open tables big enough for those tables. They started to ignore everything I said to them and at that point I realized how much of a mistake I made to actually think this place an option, no respect given, it was my birthday, and how much of a last minute inconvenience it was to  tell everyone \"we're not doing dinner tonight\". 

How ridiculous is it that a white man runs a Thai restaurant?

If You don't show your guests respect, then I don't want to give my money to a disrespectful business."}
{"text":"Although the pad thai is not that great compared to other thai restaurants in the Entertainment District, this restaurant deserves a 4 star for their islamic noodles (secret menu item) and kari noodles, both which I love. Portions are generous and prices are relatively cheap. The curries here are decent. This place gets really crowded during lunch and dinner times so be sure to come earlier!"}
{"text":"The new Salad King is finally here!!

This place made an awesome come back after being burned down twice.

Everything is good here.  I love all curry, rice and noodle dishes.  The service is fast and amazing, I came here on Tuesday and was in an out in 15 minutes!  

Go go go go go eat."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for quite some time - I kept putting it off and now that I'm back in Toronto with another visit to Salad king imminent I feel like I should probably get it done.

Is this the best Thai place in the world? Will you go eat here and never have the urge to visit Thailand or try another Thai place again? No, hell no.

Is it really tasty? Is it fairly affordable? Will you be satisfied with the meal you hurriedly stuff into your face? Yes, hell yes.

As I said, it has been a little while since I've been here; my last visit was still post-fire though... relax. I had the mango salad and the chicken pad thai - both were excellent, the atmosphere wasn't too loud either. Although I can believe that it does get quite noisy. 

All in all, I would recommend it without hesitation. You'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Great food. Gets super busy though, due to Ryerson students and being downtown. No reservations. The washrooms are nice and I highly recommend the mini fried shrimp appetizer."}
{"text":"Salad King is one of the better options for downtown dining.  The quality far exceeds the price.  With some incredibly flavorful dishes, at very affordable prices, you can eat like a true Salad King.  My favorite is the Spicy Beef and rice, a generous portion of beef and vegetables, that tastes wonderful.  Their other options are great also, bearing in mind that the menu is quite extensive, almost each and every item delivers what is promised.  With perhaps the exception of the noodle soup.  This is the only letdown, considerably blander then other choices, it is however, an anomaly on an otherwise flawless experience.  

When coming here, I really recommend the spring rolls, there is something about them that separates them from most other Thai restaurants.  I don't usually sing the praises of spring rolls, but these are phenomenal.

Dinner and drinks for two people for under $30, money well spent, in a great location."}
{"text":"Salad king never fails if I want decent priced Thai food. It's definitely not as good as say..Pai though (my fav. Thai restaurant). And it's not the most authentic either. But when you're hungry and on a  budget, this is the place.

I usually get some kind of curry here, but this time I thought I'd try the infamous not so secret item..Islamic noodles $11 with veggies. This dish has I think some sort of peanut based sauce and it was really delicious. And i wanna add that this dish was HUGE, you'll definitely have some leftovers. My bf didn't like it though..He had the golden curry with shrimp 10.95 and I thought for that price, they should've added more shrimp. 

Great food here but I really dislike the communal seating."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially if you are looking for something affordable downtown. Try not to go with a lot of people as it takes a lot longer to get seated, especially during peak hours. 
The service is fast, the food is good and never fails to impress."}
{"text":"Quantity and quantity for a good price. Service was excellent, and the environment was clean and nice too! I will definitely come back with friends and family."}
{"text":"I would have this place less than 1 star if I could. By far, worst salad dishes I've ever had the displeasure of trying. Both the mango and papaya salad were so badly bad that it was mind blowing-its in your name! How one can mess salad up is beyond comprehension (may I suggest taking a bit of time and googling any recipe or put in just a bit of effort into what you are serving). The dressing of the salads tasted of bad artificial lemon/lime concoction drizzled on straight up. The price paid was appalling was such lack of care and quality put into the food. The noodle and other offerings were less than memorable....put it that way, I've had better tasting food at Thai express-sad part is that's not even an exaggeration...the food really depict the lack of care or even respect towards their patron....worse slap in the face ever when you realize you have to pay downtown price for sub-par bottom of the barrow scraps. Can't remember the last time I've tried a place only to bang my head regretting my decision to pass up MacDonald's..."}
{"text":"Got in sat for 10 min without a greet or a glass of water (@ 5pm, very few tables) at all from the server. Looked around for some help and came in eye contact with two gentlemen at the \"drink bar\" and saw them chatting with three other servers. Sat another 5 min and asked some other server to grab my server and realized my server was in that group playing with her cell phone. She came and brought a glass of water, said \"Hi\" and took my order. Then off she goes again playing with her phone at the \"drink bar\". Food is fine. U'll be better off buying takeouts."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a couple years but the food is just as delicious as I remember! I ordered Siam noodles and coconut chicken soup, and my boyfriend got a chicken curry (can't remember which one). 

The soup was delicious and perfectly spicy, best coconut chicken soup I've had so far! The noodles were also amazing, though next time I will get them even spicier. The curry was also divine, just the right amount of coconut and spice. mmmm! 

The service was also fast and incredibly friendly despite the place being crowded with holiday shoppers. 

Definitely going back again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been to salad King a number of times and it has never disappointed. I can't ever think of a time that I did not enjoy my food. I would say that the service is usually very fast, the food is always fresh and delicious, the only thing is sometimes it can get very busy and crowded. You almost feel like you're in a cafeteria. Window seats are the best experience.

Try the spicy beef, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Second favourite Thai restaurant! Service is great.... However don't like the fact that clients must share tables. Love their chicken coconut milk soup (a bit spicy but very flavourful). Must stop after a long day of shopping at the Eaton Centre!"}
{"text":"Was in downtown and most of were hungry. Decided to go Salad King as we had heard of huge quantity and was once described as a hole in the wall type of place. 

Upon entering one myth was shattered as it is not a hole in the wall. It seemed a casual place but decorated nicely. 

Ordered a Green Mango Salad to start which was 2.5/5. The quantity was good, but lacked enough dressing. 

Ordered a Thai Fried Rice, two Tofu dishes - Country and Golden and a Hot Thai Noodles with a spicy scale of 20 chillies. 

The Fried Rice had great curry flavour and vegetables, but the quantity was a huge disappointment. Hardly enough for a person. The Country Tofu was disappointing as well. Not enough flavour and a almost watered gravy and the quantity again not too much. The rice provided was enough. The Golden Tofu was a hit. With flavour and and coconut milk this was perfect except for the quantity. 

The most anticipated dish was the Hot Thai Noodles. We normally ask for less oil, which we forgot and so it seemed too oily for us. The flavour was good, the spices good, however it wasn't 20 or a killer spice. As the quantity on all the dishes were not as much as we expected, we ordered a another Noodles dish called Bangkok Stir Fry. Which came with hair thick rice noodles and veggies. Same as other dishes, lacked flavour and the quantity disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and finally decided to write a review. I've tried various items on their menu but the only item I like is the Islamic noodles. I come solely for their Islamic noodles (it's the best Thai noodles I've had). I wouldn't recommend take out for this dish as the curry and the noodles are separated and requires them to be mixed. While I understand why this is done, I find it's not as tasty as having this dish fully prepared at the restaurant. Otherwise, I've found the other menu items quite bland at the medium spice level. 

Side note: beware of the spice level. I find it is very inconsistent between dishes and cooks.

Seating for the restaurant consist of a few booth and is only available to parties of 4 or more. Otherwise, everyone else is seated at the communal tables. It's not the most comfortable seating arrangement and definitely not good for those with a bad back. 

Overall, it's a relaxed restaurant with quick service. I'll definitely be back for their Islamic noodles."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with friends and co-workers. I enjoyed this place for the most part except I am giving a 3 star review because of a single visit.

I told the waiter that I was allergic to peanuts but I was given a dish with peanuts. I had only noticed after my boss mentioned that there were peanuts in my dish (which I thought were simple cashews). Although my allergies are far less severe compared to 10 years ago, I wanted to avoid peanuts just in case. Now if someone else who had been extremely allergic were to go through this, the outcome would have been much worse. 

Nonetheless, the food was very good. Here's what I tried:
1. Green curry: 5/10. This was my first ever dish at salad king and I did not like it. I was reluctant to come back after trying this dish but I finally did and fell in love with their other dishes.
2. Pineapple chicken: 8/10.This was so good, I have nothing bad to say.
3. Panang curry: 9/10. This was delicious. I got it with 3 peppers and loved it, even though I normally don't like spicy food."}
{"text":"Decent enough reviews on Yelp, combined with a few friends giving this place the thumbs up saw me enticed to try Salad King. 

Not authentic Thai...then again I was not expecting it to be. I loved the spicy scale of add 1 - 20 chili's, I like it hot...but 20 chili's, hello stomach ulcer!

I tried the shrimp hot and sour soup...it was ok. The beef satay was peanut-y perfection. My friend had chicken won ton soup and spring rolls. 

Very filling, cheap and quick. The place is clean, staff were friendly. I actually quite like the sitting at tables with other groups, school dining hall-esque feel. Kind of reminded me of eating at Wvrst.

Yes it is not the quietest of places, if you are looking for something intimate then it's not really the place to go. I just thought there was something fun about the place."}
{"text":"Great for the price!!

We visited Salad King at about 7:30 pm on a summer Sunday night and the restaurant had a pretty heavy crowd. When we arrived the wait was about 20 minutes for our party of 5. However, once we were seated, we had a pleasant waitress and the service was great. The atmosphere is simple, clean, and contemporary. We started off with the crispy spring rolls which were delicious. For the main course ordered the spicy chicken, orange chicken, phud thai with shrimp, and green mango salad. They were all quite tasty. You can also choose the level of spiciness of your entree. The restaurant is very well priced at about $8-10 dollars an entree. The portions are also pretty large. 

Overall the experience at Salad King was positive one. You can tell by the crowds that it is very popular. Though Toronto is full of great restaurants, I would definitely recommend Salad King as a tasty and economical option when in the city."}
{"text":"Solid steel everything. It's like eating in the Top Chef kitchen.
Nothing wrong with that, it makes everything look clean and organized which is important for any restaurant. The long communal seating is comfortable and practical, while the booth seating in the gazebo are more intimate and less industrial in nature. 

Either one, taste n preference, will make for a pleasant dining experience.
I ordered the green curry. It was good, thin and soupy with the standard beef, chicken or shrimp choices. Standard trimmings.

My gf ordered the Islamic noodles which is discontinued from the current menu but was on the menu before. These are bomb. I think it's the only dish I will order going forward at Salad King. It's a curried rice vermicelli with choice of meat and a veggie medley stirred in. It's delicious.

Overall, salad king is a good casual thai restaurant. The prices are reasonable, drinks are available and it's clean. Service is also really good, so don't be afraid to ask questions, they actually answer them."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Thai places in downtown Toronto. It's super big and you'll be in and out if you're on a time limit. My favourite go to is the spicy tofu. Don't get too many chillies because your Butt May feel it after. Unless of course if you're used to spicy food. The servers are always nice and on point. Definitely a place to try out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I just got takeout delivered and it was absolutely horrible! The soup was water with a few mushrooms floating in it, the pad thai had an aftertaste and the beef in the curry was rough and super chewy.. So disappointed, never again!"}
{"text":"Not a bad option for Thai food, but not great. The best parts about it are the location and the prices. Its right by Yonge and Dundas Square so it's easy to get to, and the prices are relatively cheap so it's a good option if you're on a budget.
The food itself isn't up to the standard of some of the other Thai restaurants around like PAI or Sabai Sabai, but you get what you pay for. I tried the khao soi and the green curry - both of which were average. The atmosphere isn't much different than that of a school cafeteria, and the service was mediocre. When we arrived at the restaurant, we asked if we could have a table and told the staff member that one more person would be joining us soon. We were told that we couldn't sit down until our whole party was there, so we ended up just standing around waiting, which was annoying. All in all it was an ok experience - nothing terrible but nothing great."}
{"text":"Honestly, the only Thai food I really had up until a few weeks ago was dishes from Thai Express. But after having Salad King, I don't know if I can go to any other place for quick and reasonably priced Thai food.

Salad King is considered a staple for authentic Thai cuisine for Torontonians for the past 20 years. They are known for good service, quality Thai selections, and reasonable prices. Their menu is comprised of a lot of common dishes you would see on a menu if you were to go to a restaurant in Thailand. Customers can choose from dishes varying from Pad Thai to Thai Fried Rice to Curry all the way to Tom Yum Soup. But, there is the Secret Menu option that customers can select, which is their Islamic Noodles. It was one of the best dishes I have ever had in my life. It was an amazing balance between lightly pan fried noodles with chicken with a Panang curry sauce which goes very nicely with the al dente noodles and dense vegetables.

Overall, I am blown away by the flavors in the dishes they serve here. I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a great restaurant with good service and bold flavours."}
{"text":"Came in late one evening to have dinner. The food is excellent as always. I used to go often during the spring/ summer time. The last time I've been there was last year May. I've noticed some changes.
One primarily is the pricing of the food. Many years ago before they moved a main entree was about $6.00 - $7.00 (non seafood that is). Now prices are average about $9.00 +. Servings are still very generous. We had shrimp phud Thai, shrimp parang curry and spring rolls. All very delicious. Must have with peanut sauce!!!!  One comment I have is about the service. It wasn't only myself but the other customers sitting on the same row as us. We all received our waters, no name of who will be serving us. Literally waited fifteen minutes before someone takes our order. It's quite obvious if people are looking around for someone to attend to them. Couldn't irk me enough that even \"J's\" (who was our server ) colleagues who can see that we were upset with the lack of service didn't even attend to us or at least acknowledge that we were ready to order and \"let her know we were ready\".  It's team work. If one person is not picking up the slack, help out. Makes the atmosphere look really bad--- let alone the restaurant. No excuses if it's the beginning or end of the shift- tired or not.... Get it together and pay attention. She didn't even check in on us after we got our food. I even had to turn around and look at her when our waters were empty... If the service is like this what would make me want to go again? Don't let this be your reputation salad king!!!  Your food is amazing!!! I would definitely go again! BUT if you had someone who came there for the first time - I would say that was an overall bad experience. One last suggestion. Find an area or a rack where people can put their coats/ jackets. Especially during winter! The under the chair/ bench thing won't cut it... Area is too small and don't want to be disturbing people... Also have more high chairs/ booster seats for infants/ babies. Prior my last visit, I had a two year old with me! Was that ever the worst experience. We had to keep him in his stroller coz they had no high chairs! I even saw a couple as well who had the same experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! 

It's fun, casual, youthful, modern, stylish,  fast and inexpensive!  It's really one of those places no one in my family (incl.  extended) complains about going there,  and we have some real negative Nelly's.  I love a bunch of great dishes there.  The service is great, staff friendly and knowledgeable about the food so they can help you choose.  I would recommend this place without hesitation.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"oh Salad King!! 

I haven't visited in years but I stopped on the way from a photo shoot..

I started with the Tom Yom soup - it was just broth with 6 slices of mushroom, 4 leaves of coriander and 2 giant pieces of bay leaves I couldn't eat.. the broth was tasty but really? for $3.50, you couldn't throw in a few more slices of mushroom?

For the main I had the chicken pad thai. It was all noodle. very bland chicken and with 5 chilis, wasn't very hot either.

There was also MSG in the food. I got so sick when I got home. Not the nicest drive I've had in recent times.

oh salad king. I. Am. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this joint for a solid 10 years and I must say nothing has changed besides its location.
The food was solid, especially the Bangkok Stir Fry Noodles which were delicious. My son inhaled the green curry chicken and I had the orange beef 10 chilies which was perfecto.
Location is a bitch for peeps like me from the burbs but if I'm anywhere near Eaton Centre which I try not to be I will definitely stop in for takeout."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Thai food to be honest but maybe that's because of the horrible Thai express food I've tried. I really enjoyed the flavours and the cheap prices. If I were to have Thai again then this is probably the spot I would go to."}
{"text":"Extremely loud and busy at lunch. Come by 11:30 or you will need to wait for a seat. I like that even though they have communal tables it felt roomy. The spring rolls were ok. The Siam noodle dish was delicious and mild enough for me (I'm a spice wimp). I tasted my friend's rainbow noodles ( Woo!). Also tried a fried shrimp rice dish - rice was meh but the battered shrimp was really good!"}
{"text":"It's the moment we've all been waiting for: the reopening of Salad King! This day couldn't come any sooner. I remember planning a celebration lunch/dinner after my last final exam of the winter semester, only to arrive at school one day and being informed of the collapse of the Empress Hotel. Since then, I've vowed to be amongst the first to dine once it reopened. (For the record, I missed out on both their soft opening and the official opening, as I went away for a few days).

We arrived at the new location around 7 PM, with the line leading all the way downstairs, with an estimated 15 to 20 minute wait. Names weren't also going to be taken down, until you finally got upstairs. Fortunately for us, everyone in front of us consisted of parties of 3 or more, so when the hostess called down the line to see if there was a party of 2, we were immediately seated!

I must say, I was quite impressed with what they've done to the place. It closely resembles their former location, with the elbow-to-elbow seating and cafeteria-like layout. I was particularly amused by their seats, which now have a basket for your belongings underneath them, similar to the desks you find in high school.

We were disappointed to learn that they were out of the Crispy Spring Rolls, and stuck with our main dishes instead. I was about to order the Thai Basil Noodles, but then I remembered the Thai Islamic Noodle, which isn't listed on their regular menu. I was delighted to discover that they do, in fact, still serve this \"hidden\" menu item. Essentially what it is, is a rice noodle with chicken, shrimp, vegetables, served in a red curry. As expected, it was the same great taste that I've craved for months and can't wait to try my other favourite dishes again. I'll admit, though, that the serving seemed a bit smaller than what I remembered. I'm not sure if it they were downsizing to accommodate for everyone given the demand since opening, but we'll see how it is in future visits.

As for the spiciness, I originally opted for 10 chilis (out of 20), but our server mentioned some of the feedback regarding their spicy scale, and that customers have commented on the spiciness being a bit spicier than before. I ended up lowering it to 5, and on my personal scale, it was a mild, and next time I'll stick with 10 chilis. To be honest, I think the feedback was primarily due to being deprived from Salad King for months ;)

For now, I'm going to stick with 4 stars. Once things normalize, I'll revisit this review and make any necessary changes. Other than that, our server, Jamie, was pleasant and delightful, and the water bearers were constantly refilling our water. With this semester being my last at Ryerson, you can definitely count on me dining in or ordering take out plenty of times in the near future :)"}
{"text":"So my fiancee loves Salad King. She says that the Curry served here is the best in the city. I also enjoy a good Thai resturant and not being from around here I am always eager to eat someplace that is held in high regards by her.  With that being said, we gave this place 2 go's on my previous visits and each time I found that the food I got was good, but by no means fantastic by my palate.  The first go I ordered the Mango Chicken dish. When arrived the presentation was excellent but flavor was lackluster. It seemed to have something missing and was rather bland. Second go I got the orange chicken which had a lot more flavor this time, however a few pieces of my chicken came out cold. 

It's in a good location and is constantly busy whenever we go by it. When we get the urge for Thai we'll continue coming here, it just has room for little improvements here and there."}
{"text":"Came hear with my dad. Everything was very good. I had the Islamic noodle (chicken) and it tastes exactly as I imagined it to be from the picture. It had lots of coconut flavour in the curry. My curry was mild and i thought that was good enough for me. It still had a slight heat. Enough to make it feel like a curry. If you can't handle your spicy i think a mild is the way to go. The noodles were great. They were practical drowning in the curry. It absorbed all the curry flavours. The veggies were all nice, mixed in with all that creamy curry. The chicken didn't really seen to fit in. At first I didn't even know it was chicken. I think next time I'll order the veggie version. My dad had the fried rice. He enjoyed it but he liked my Islamic noodle better. The portion was huge. I thought the bowl was endless."}
{"text":"Nothing authentic about this place. But portions are huge and let's you customize the menus a lot. Feels more like a cafeteria rather than a restaurant even though food is served to you. They always seem to lack number of servers compared to the guest number. Servers are constantly busy running around and seem unhappy. The table next to me didn't tip because they got very poor service (the server literally threw the plate on the table) and the server came up to them and aggressively said \"Why? You unhappy with my service?\" And walked away."}
{"text":"Salad King is a decently priced delicious Thai restaurant that existed long before the other \"more authentic\" group of Thai restaurants owned by Nuit opened around downtown. The food portions here are always good. You can also select the amount of chili peppers which is awesome (go for 10!).

Must order their secret menu item if you come here which is the \"Thai Islamic Noodles\".

Always busy so avoid weekday lunch hour office crowd or call for reservations if they take em."}
{"text":"I've visited Salad King on multiple occasions over the years and always found the food enjoyable. It is by no means the most authentic Thai restaurant but it doesn't advertise itself as such and it's delicious none the less. I like to think of this as a \"starter\" restaurant for those who don't normally eat Thai food or those who want a quicker, cheaper alternative to the more popular Thai restaurants in the city. 

My most recent orders have been: 
- Siam noodles (with beef): best option for those who love peanuts
- Islamic noodles (with chicken): not listed on the menu but is definitely a must try. Best way for me to describe this is a penang curry noodle dish...less curry than khao soi but more sauce and sweeter than your typical pad thai. 
- Thai fried rice: I found this a little on the dry side but very flavourful and aromatic. This paired perfectly with the Islamic noodles. 

Restaurant gets pretty load and packed during peak dining hours and the set-up is mainly communal tables. This means you should be prepared to sit next to strangers. Difficult to have a private conversation but at least they have quick table turnovers so can't complain about that!"}
{"text":"I had not been to Salad King for over 3 years now. However the student like prices feel good so I decided to check them out at their new location on Yonge Street. I settled on the Panang Curry with Chicken without much dilemma. Order was pronto..within 5-10 minutes I was served with my food. And boy, the food was wonderful. I am not judge of authentic Thai food, but the taste of this dish and the smell of the other herbs and spices were magical to my nose and tongue sensors. My friends ordered Golden Curry with chicken, Spicy Chicken with rice and Golden Tofu and all of them had nothing but good words for this place.

Pros: Prices. Not a single menu over $10 and this is hard to beat in a location on Yonge Street. Very good tasting food.

Cons: Very busy place - one may have to wait for long times. Also one may have the misfortune to be fitted in to one of their \"Everyone table\" where you do not get privacy and have to sit with random strangers. That is a great thing for speed dating, but maybe not for a food joint.

Overall, a definite repeat in 1-2 months time."}
{"text":"I had this dish everyone says is from the 'secret' menu. Ouuu secret menu :) 

It's called it the 'Islamic' noodles. We have no clue why they called it that, but perhaps there is a storey behind it. There's also a dish called the 'Evil Jungle Prince' lol!

I enjoyed the Islamic noodles, and would try this dish again. Basically, it's a cross between these two existing dishes on their menu:
PANANG CURRY
Sweet Asian basil, peanuts, lime leaf & bell peppers in Panang curry with coconut milk.
HOT THAI NOODLES
Rice noodles, broccoli, carrots, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms & egg

You can choose between vegetarian, chicken, or shrimp. I wish they had been more generous with the chicken in my dish. 

The sauce was rich and creamy (coconut milk). If you don't like too much sauce, then I don't think you'll like this dish. 

You can choose your spice level. I chose the '10' chili spice level, and it was perfect for me. I like spicy and hot food. 

This was a nice place for our group of 4. Modern decor and overall nice atmosphere. We got there on a Monday around noon. The place fills up really quickly."}
{"text":"This place was really yummy- I loved the Penang beef curry and the spring rolls. We did a huge catering order and they were really helpful/it was perfectly put together."}
{"text":"Decor:
Salad King is a very interesting restaurant. The place is quite modern but at the same time it's like I'm back in high school eating in my cafeteria. I guess the restaurant is just trying to maximize space but all of the costumers have to sit very close together usually. It could get uncomfortable because of the limited space you have when you eat. Unless you're lucky and get to sit by the window or a booth. 

Food: 
The food is fantastic here! Every time I'm in downtown Toronto and someone asks me where I want to eat, most of the time I choose Salad King. I usually ask for something that's actually not on the menu anymore. I would ask for thai basil noodles with panang curry and it never disappoints! I would definitely suggest you guys to try it.

Service: 
Food comes out pretty quickly most of the time and the servers I have had are usually pretty nice.

Overall, Salad King has very good and authentic Thai food and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"The food is pretty great and the quantity is also good but I hate the seating arrangements.  You have to seat side by side on long table in the middle so not much privacy and to top that it's always ALWAYS busy. 

But still a really good place with great food. Been there a lot of times will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I'm not one to back down from a call to spice up my dish. Had a delicious Pud Thai with '10 chilis' which gave me a good kick. Be warned their spice scale is not linear, so it gets significantly hotter as you add more chilis."}
{"text":"Spicy Fish $10 - I guess I was expecting a dry fish dish and was disappointed with this one.  The fish were breaded and deep fried, but was soaking in sauce so the fillet were soggy.  I wasn't a fan of the shredded carrots and the bell peppers in this dish.  This dish comes spicy (which cannot be made unspicy), but the spice level was good.  The rice was good and the portion was generous.

My coworker had the Thai fried rice and decided to go with spice level of 10 (on a scale of 20) and couldn't eat his meal.  The waiter did try to warn him that it was too high.  I tried a bit and it was pretty spicy.

I didn't see Thai Iced Tea or Coffee on the menu, which I like to order when I'm having Thai food.  We asked the waiter about it and we were in luck!  They JUST got Thai Iced Tea and it was good, not too sweet for $2.75.

The decor is nice and colorful and they have window seats available.  The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor.

Service was friendly but slow during lunch hour."}
{"text":"It is ideal for a quick and filling  dinner/ lunch. The staff is always friendly and efficient. Not sure about the quality of food, lots of sodium in the dishes"}
{"text":"I think salad king is a nice place for cheap eats! 
The benches aren't really what i would prefer seating wise-- its loud and I get easily distracted by other conversations :p
I had the thai islamic noodles which is a pretty good dish for 10 bucks! its actually not on the new menu, but if you ask for it, they'll know what you're talking about ;)
oh and the new renvo's are great!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best thai restaurants in Toronto!!!  Great prices and amazing food. Cafeteria style seating lends to a more casual atmostphere."}
{"text":"To be honest, if you are looking for a quick Thai fast food this is the place to be. But to compare this to actual authentic Thai food, this place is trash. I don't get why everything tasted like peanut? And all of the stir fried choices are watery? If you have been to Thailand and had eaten real Thai food, you would have not come back for this. I get it that the price for a dish is really affordable, but I would definitely pay more to get better food."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name, this is definitely not a salad only place.  The thai food here is very good.  I've gone several times and the service is always very quick and they have great portion sizes also!  It's usually enough for 2 meals for me!  They have tons of table space so I have never had to wait very long to be seated.

It's definitely not the best Thai food I've had but it's definitely not the worst either.  Definitely a good place to go that's central to just about everything downtown."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place! the only problem was trying to find parking, we finally found a parking lot up in a small street ($10 flat rate)

The seating on this place is tight, they have people sitting right next to each other. however, cause this place is so loud, it is fine, you still do not hear any one else' conversations.

The food is delicious! and the portions are pretty big. Though I would skip the soup, they are very watery. I want to try everything here!"}
{"text":"I went back one day because it was on my way home and I wanted to try the Islamic noodles everyone was talking about. I'm not going to lie: I was disappointed. Like most things I had tried before, the noodles were just OK, nothing crazy about them. Once again, the price/portion size ratio was great but the price/quality ratio was lacking."}
{"text":"This place was excellent! I ordered Islamic Noodles, which is a \"secret item\" where they combine two other dishes. My waitress actually didn't know what it was since she was new, but luckily her colleague was able to help out. I was surprised by the interior of the place, as it was sort of casual sitting but there are wait staff. My waitress was really nice and helped me out with some touristy questions. All in all it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Always love their panang sauce !!! Thats my order that I always get everytime!! 
I love the panang sauce with noodles mmMMMm or with rice , you would just have to ask for it !
I always order a glass of thai ice tea too !! yay.. then I'm satisfied!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Simply a hyped up Thai Express in a fancier dining room in my opinion! Also the coconut water is not pure, it contains added sugar!"}
{"text":"Went back to Salad King shortly after my last review because I found out about the Islamic Noodles!!

Rushed back and it was so worth it. Islamic noodles is a mixed between Pad Thai and curry and the coconut taste was really strong which I enjoyed because I love coconut. 

I can see the difference in the portions because mine was more noodles and less sauce where as my partner's was more sauce and less noodles. Because his was saucier it looked more appetizing than mine but oh well, still tasted great!

Guess I've found my go to dish at Salad King!"}
{"text":"I got takeout just an hour ago because I wanted to their Islamic Noodle that my friend has been raving about. I was happy with it until i saw a thick short curly back hair inside the dish. It looks like either armpit or pubic hair so I'm very disgusted at the moment. I tried calling them 7 times and they haven't been picking up..."}
{"text":"Damn it if it wasn't for the delicious Siam Noodles I may boycot this place. I'm SO tired of them making you stand and wait if your whole party hasn't arrived - even if you insist that they're coming in 3 minutes - they just don't care. 

Now, I've been going to Salad King since I was at Ryerson and they were a hole in the wall dive with picnic tables and questionable food preparation methods. I would eat there at LEAST twice a week for a good 4 years of my life. 

But now with their new location and new makeover seems to come with a new snobby attitude. I used to feel like I was being taken care of, now I just feel like they don't care cause they know I'll wait.

I wish they would remember where they came from - friendly staff, humble picnic tables and plastic tablecloths. Because now all there is are cold hard cafeteria benches, refusing to seat guests and a restaurant that is getting a bit too popular for its own good."}
{"text":"Delicious Pad thai, excellent service and good value (large portions, small price). The only thing that made it lose a star is sometimes the curry isn't very hot and it tastes too sweet. Otherwise amazing"}
{"text":"Walking in we saw a young lady come up to us and told us to go upstairs.  We thought she was a customer or student walking out the door after a meal.

The upstairs was not a bright  clean communal lunch hall feel like the downstairs, but rather like a dim red mood resto feel with group table arrangement.

I did something I regret.  I ordered the Basil Beef here as I looked and dissect it while enjoying the Hot & Sour Shrimp Soup.  I was feeling for SOUP warm soup so I ordered my soup and wanted Noodle Soup too and the waiter looked surprised, I do tend to think untraditional methodology at times.

He was friendly enough to say that the Soup was similar to Noodle Soup so I asked him to choose an item for me.  I told him I wanted Rice and Beef, and he said Basil Beef and whats better than one of my all time favourites right??  WRONG!

It came looking all SOUPY, all the Vegetables were boiled rather than sweated or stir-fry which DID make it a healthy chose but it lost all the INTENSE flavours of the dish.

The Beef was over-boiled and tough as if I was a COW chewing Grass except I am not a cow and do not like chewing tough TASTELESS Beef slices.

The steam rice that came with the Basil Beef was CLUMPY?  How can an Electric Rice Cooker screw up rice?

My friends Pad Thai and Fried Rice wasn't much better but at least what they have going for them is a good VALUE.  FYI, the services spoke Cantonese so maybe I can make better relations with them next time and find something BETTER to eat."}
{"text":"Thai basil noodle. Hands down. 10 chillis. 
It's a great dish but that much better when it's very spicy, just adds to it."}
{"text":"The food here is decent and reasonably priced. The non-existent service here completely ruins the experience for me every time and I do not plan on coming back.  I agree that the evening rush is very hectic but you get cruddy service no matter what time of day. Servers ignore you by if they aren't your server, wait they do that even if they are your server! The last time I was there, we found hair in my friends food (granted that happens in other places as well) and my server gave my food to another customer who had come in about 1/2 hr after my friend & I did. The manager handled both situations well but unless they train their staff better, I can't see myself coming back. The hot dog vendors give me better service."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Salad King, as I work near this place, but I only get a 30 minute lunch break.  I decided to use my free credits with the Ritual app, so that I could order takeout.

The process was seamless and took me 1 minute to complete.  The estimated time they gave me initially was 20 minutes, but it got reduced to ~12.5 minutes from the time I ordered.  When I arrived, everything was ready to go - I literally walked up to the counter, told them my name/I ordered via Ritual, they gave me my food, I dipped - We're living in the future, confirmed.

I ordered the Pineapple Chicken for $9.75 but got an additional 20% off for using the app.  They gave me the chicken, sauce, veggies, pineapple in 1 container, and a buttload of steamed rice in another container.  The meal itself was okay - nothing to rave about, but the portion size was pretty substantial.  The sauce tasted like sweet fake syrup.  This dish was recommended as one of the most popular on the app, and so I ordered it impulsively - next time I'll check Yelp first.

Though I was underwhelmed by the food, the service was efficient and worked flawlessly.  The long tables in the restaurant are perfect to eat a casual lunch with friends.  I will likely give Salad King another chance to reclaim its throne which resides on my taste buds."}
{"text":"I'm the kind of girl who likes it fast and cheap.  Yes.  That's right.
  Salad King delivers on both ends.  It's clean, bright, and busy.  The food is spot on for what you would expect.  My doors are hardly blown off, yet, my expectations are always met.  This is never a bad thing.  
  Without adding to the echo of multiple reviews on this place, I'll simply state that it's a fun place, worth your while if you are in the hood.  The golden curry is s favorite, alongside the chicken satay and various noodle dishes.  Go.  Eat.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I like the food at Salad King... Particularly because they give generous portions and I always have an extra meal for leftovers the next day!

The servers are friendly, but sometimes the restaurant is so busy that they don't have time to check up on you regularly. I often come here in twos with just one other person, and if I'm seated at a long bench table that's filled with others, it's very squishy and uncomfortable for the both of us. I would much rather prefer a booth, but again, if you go around the regular lunch/dinner time, they're usually busy and don't have space to seat you where you want. I just go for takeout if I see that it's packed.

The food is still pretty good, but there are a lot of other Thai places in Downtown Toronto that are better in my opinion. My go-to dishes are either the Pad Thai or Islamic Noodles. Both are very flavourful and saucy! 

Note: If you can't handle spicy, do not get more than 1 chilli. It makes quite the difference."}
{"text":"Every Ryerson student knows this place and it has the best Phad Thai in Toronto

I usually order the chicken Phad Thai with three to five 'chili's' (on Salad King's spice scale)

I have tried and tried to find a comparable Phad Thai across the GTA and have failed miserably 

This is the go-to spot for all Phad Thai lovers"}
{"text":"This is a 5 star place for me in this restaurant's category.

I've always found Salad King to be consistently good on food and service and it keeps me coming back. Also a very fair price for what you get!

Tried Favourites: Phud Thai, Thai Curry, Tom Yum Soup,"}
{"text":"The place is packed and mostly communal seating. Many happy faces which does not only stem from the relatively cheap menu items for this part of the town. 

Service is quick and friendly and it was no big deal to change my order with Larissa when I remembered to order the Islamic Noodles instead of my initial choice. 

My spring rolls were steaming hot and fresh and pretty good. Not outstanding, but then again, this is no place to expect outstanding. The noodles were pretty yummy. I didn't quite get what makes them Islamic, but that didn't stop me from enjoying them. All in all a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"I use to come here a lot for fast Thai food. But lately, I find that their service and the food quality is on the decline. As expected, this place is always busy so the seating isn't the most comfortable. But I find the dinning room extremely loud now - I mean, if I am having a hard time talking to the person seating right across from me, it really is too loud. The service the last few times I have come here has been so so and the last time I was here, I had to constantly wave for my server in order to get service. The quality of the food is not reflective of the prices that they charge. I understand that this is fast Thai food, but I have to say the food quality use to be better. Overall, the past few experiences I had here have not been very good. I don't think I would be coming here any time soon."}
{"text":"Either you dislike Salad King, or you love Salad King.

The place is fairly busy, loud and usually you'll find a lot of repeat customers who will swear by this place.  There is a wide selection of food, it all tastes great.  You get to choose how spicy you want your dishes (There is even a scale meter which is always a good laugh.)

At the end of the meal, everyone is full, you don't spend a lot here to get good food.  Afterwards you can go across street to many desert restaurants near Dundas and Yonge."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times, and everything I've ordered has been delicious. The prices are reasonable and the portions are big, which is a huge plus! Service is quick and friendly, and the food arrives relatively fast too, even when it's busy - and it can get real busy!
My mom doesn't like Thai food or spicy food in general, but I took her here and she really enjoyed it! Highly recommend for anyone attending Ryerson, considering it's so close and overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Got take out here for the first time. Service was nothing special--no one greeted me or gave me any recommendations when I had a hard time deciding. Anyways, I went with the spicy fish meal which I didn't enjoy at all. It had a very strong ginger taste so if you don't like ginger then stay far away from this choice. I also I was going there with the assumption that it was a salad place because of the name but I was surprised when it was a full meal.

Overall, both service and food sucked so I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I had not been back to Salad King for a couple of years and was craving the hot Thai noodles and so we made the trek downtown and arrived around 5pm.  Luckily we did not have to wait at all for seats and so I thought it's my lucky day.  The server sat us at a non kid friendly table which was not a good thing and when u sit four people around a tiny square table it sets things up to be a disaster.  The servers were quick in dropping off the water and refilling, but the plastic cups just made it seem cheap.

We ordered spring rolls, hot Thai noodles and the green curry.  The spring rolls came out right away as they probably had been cooked a while ago and warmed they were ok but would have been better if it was actually hot.

The hot Thai noodles came out along with the green chicken curry shortly after.  The hot Thai noodles were just as a remembered and tasted so good with the mix of noodles, veggies and chicken.  The noodles may have been a tad over cooked, but you can't win them all.  The green curry with chicken was just so so and I have had way better at Little Bangkok so was not overly impressed with it.  We had to order the mango chicken and the dish came out looking more like mango soup.  It tastes all right and passable but would not order again as it was sloppily put together.  

The worst part of the experience were there restrooms.  Enough said.

The reason I gave them a two is because the hot Thai noodle there is decent.  I probably will not be making this trip downtown again not for what we got today.  Very disappointed in the food quality."}
{"text":"When it first opened, Salad King was cheap, tasty and different. Good different. However, over time the prices skyrocketed, the portions decreased and the quality lacked flavour. The food is never consistent. I usually order the pad thai and seafood fried rice, when it's made right, it's pretty good. Service is quick and the restaurant is noisy and busy.

The dishes are approx. $10-$15."}
{"text":"Great pricing & food! always SO busy though and not a big fan of the long-table dining. But wait times are not bad so it's working for them."}
{"text":"I have gone to Salad King since the very beginning when it was a ghetto cafeteria where you order at the cash and then pick it on a tray when it was ready. I have loved it ever since then! 

My favourite thing to order off the current menu is the spicy fish. Lightly breaded fish in a slightly sweet sauce. 3 chillies on this fish dish is pretty hot compared to the same chillies count on their cream-based curries. Delicious every time.

Off-the-menu item is the Islamic noodles. Peanut based sauce on rice noodles. 

They now have a frequent diner card."}
{"text":"First visit. Great food, beautiful decor, clean... I love how unique the look is. My friend and I was assigned a spot on a long table that is shared with others, which didn't bother me. There are more private births but those are more limited. I like very spicy food but had a hard time handling the 15 chili rating. Watch out for that. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Not the best thai food I've had, but it was good. They refill your water very frequently which is nice. It was spicy (had 4 chillis), but otherwise pretty tasteless."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for salad king! Lines out the door, super packed all the time, the food must be good... right? Well I experienced Salad King in all its glory. I made reservations in advance, knowing how busy it gets. When we got there around 6:30, there was already a line out the door. We were escorted to the second floor, where the setting and atmosphere is totally different! It was almost a different restaurant. Table settings, glasses and cloth napkins aligned the dimly lit chill atmosphere, it like like *gasp* a normal restaurant, as oppose to a high school cafeteria.  

We were given a side of salted peanuts which were OK.  Different menu, and the prices may have been slightly higher. I was all gun-ho about trying the pad thai, but unfortunately they didn't have a vegetarian pad thai (without fish sauce)... There was only two things on the menu that were 100% vegetarian, the thai noodles and some tofu thing.  i opted for the noodles.  

It was very saucy, but surprisingly extremely delish. My boyfriend ordered the pad thai (lucky dog).  Others ordered the fish curry, tom yum soup and some duck dish.  All and all, people seemed impressed.  Except for maybe one incident where my friend bit down into a cherry tomato (from her fish curry) that tasted like propane.  YUCK! 

The service was mediocre at best. The staff weren't overly friendly , but they were attentive.  I guess at a busy and popular place like this, they really don't need to have good customer service."}
{"text":"Salad King is pretty solid and its location is awesome-- very near the Yonge and Dundas Square.

I really like the pad thai, with good portion size and quite flavorful. Pricing resents good value when you're on the lookout for affordable, yet good tasting, Thai food."}
{"text":"The place is nice and clean with nice restrooms. However, the service was mediocre at best. The \"Chicken with Cashew\" had a raw aftertaste, our server forgot that we ordered beers with our meals and my stomach is a bit queasy the following morning."}
{"text":"Well hidden on yonge street, however if you find it and head up stairs you'll notice that it's... UNBELIEVABLY PACKED! 

This place is like a war zone! I cannot even imagine how many customers these guys must serve every day. The server some how manages to keep track of all your orders and fill your glasses promptly. Needless to say, this is one of the best options around the area at an affordable price point. You'll see alot of young working people eating here after work. The turn around time for meals is very fast here, people come and go every 20 minutes or so, yet the place looks spectacularly well-maintained. After a couple of visits you will begin to appreciate the hustle and bustle of this place."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. Amazing food. Their won-ton soup and mango salad are my two favourite items. This place has such SPICY dishes if you are into that, not all dishes are spicy but do look for the chili pepper symbols beside the menu items."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times, and I can't say I have been disappointed by their food. You get exactly what you order. I have always ordered their chicken curry and never been disappointed. The food is good and standard. It is very westernized and not authentic. They are a good choice for those that want to try thai food but are afraid of committing to a more authentic restaurant. Everything on the menu is safe to eat. 

The only cons I've experienced would be the annoying picnic table seating. I don't like being so close to others. Their hot and sour mushroom soup was really bad. Holy moly, it was so spicy I couldn't finish it. It was pretty much spicy water that was inedible. Major disappointment. 
Don't think I'd come here as my first choice thai restaurant, I've only come here because others want to come here."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Salad King by two friends/former colleagues when it was on the east side of Yonge St. At the time, I thought it was a salad bar (judging by its name only). I was instantly hooked: green curry chicken was my favourite dish until they told me about the \"secret menu\" and I tried the Islamic Thai Noodles. The combination of noodles, vegetables and chicken/shrimp along with the creamy richness of the panang sauce (I think that's what it's called) gives me the best food coma every single time. It is by far my go-to dish unless I am craving the coconut milk and spiciness of the green curry chicken. If you're just into the basics, like pad thai, it's also quite good here. I would strongly recommend that you try something different while you're here."}
{"text":"My Toronto food trip. First time trying this restaurant. Such a cool place to eat! Situated in downtown, very spacious, long tables, nice ambiance. 
We had beef skewers and pad thai. Everything was just SO GOOD. Best skewers i've eaten so far. The dipping sauce just makes it so delicious. My experience here was really nice. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pros:

Delicious food! My recommendations are the satay chicken or beef and any homemade curry.

Cons:

During peak hours the restaurant is packed. The servers are wonderful and fast but the greeters are unfriendly and un-accommodating. With one or two patrons max, you will always have to sit at a communal table.

I would recommend going at an off hour for the best experience."}
{"text":"Love this place.
I've practically tried everything on the menu. I have been a customer since they were at their old location back in 2008. Obviously, things changed after they moved - especially the size of the location and the menu but the flavours are still just as amazing! Not necessarily authentic Thai but still amazing especially their Seafood Fried Rice with 5 chilles. Must have experience :)"}
{"text":"It's been ages since I ate at Salad King as a university student with a limited budget. I'm glad to see that they've cleaned up a bit but still offer a number of dishes I used to eat many years ago. 

First of all the restaurant is located on the second floor and thankfully there are stairs as well as an elevator for greater accessibility. The restaurant also has communal seating at sleek metal tables, so if you don't like eating shoulder to shoulder with strangers, this may not be the place for you. They have  gender indifferent single stall washrooms. 

I like that they still offer decent fast casual food at affordable prices. I went with my go to basil beef and hubby ordered the golden curry chicken. There was a generous amount of meat in each of our dishes. I appreciate that you can customize the level of spiciness, where one chili is mild. Rice portions are generous too.

If in the area of Yonge and Dundas, it is worth checking out Salad King. It can get quite busy, so allot extra time if you're heading to the theatre nearby. The mom and daughter seated next to us did not leave enough time prior to curtain time and ended up leaving before their meal was served"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past few weeks and I have to say that I've had a very consistent experience. The pad thai - or phud thai, as they call it here - is pretty standard. I would warn against being too liberal with the spiciness levels as they do go up quite quickly and dramatically. The serving size is quite generous and I like to share it with someone else. Usually I find that a salad or another appetizer plus the pad thai is enough for two. Their salads are not particularly interesting - the mango salad consisted primarily of sliced mangoes, which is a stark contrast to the usual mango salad where you get a bed of lettuce topped sparsely with mangoes.
 
Overall Salad King is really inexpensive and the service is fast. The trade-off is that there are communal tables - where you'll probably end up if you're in a small party - and that the restaurant space can be quite loud. I've found myself yelling both times I went there so I've resolved to only go back to Salad King when conversation isn't the focal point of the meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I've really enjoyed everything I've had...except the pad thai. I find it unfortunate that everythind else has been so great but for some reason they couldn't nail this stable...That being said, I would definitely recommend the fresh spring rolls...they don't skimp on the mango which is appreciated.

Be forewarned if you're a large group, you'll likely have to wait to get seated."}
{"text":"Love the Emerald Curry. Not keen on the atmosphere since it's so loud, but it's worth it for specific dishes."}
{"text":"Service is still abysmal and the seating is not the best.  It's also super loud so not a great place for dinner conversation.  The food I got recently however was really good: Islamic noodles (it's essentially pad Thai noodles with panang curry)"}
{"text":"been here multiple times usually juggling with few shopping bags and with many friends. the location is golden, decor is fun, environment is friendly, and food is decent. 

i had a few things on their menu but my fav is the islamic noodle. i know it's not on the menu but everyone knows what it is.. and oh it's soo yummy. i usually go with 5 peppers and put more at my own pace if needed. sometimes the peppers system can be altered due to the chef's mood. go easy on that. 

most times i can't finish the whole dish, take the leftovers with you for lunch next day is still delish!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, descent portion for affordable price.. will always come back here.. food served fresh And fast..  the only thing that i don't like is too noisy..or should i say people so loud,beside you have to seat beside people u don't know.. and the location is far unless you shop at eaton or your around that area then i suggest to dine in this resto.. they should open close to yorkdale.."}
{"text":"Holy mother of goodness, how have I never been here until now?! I always walked by and thought it was salad because of the name and was like \"it'll be a cold day in hell before I pay for a basic bitch salad when I make my own everyday\" but after being informed of the bomb Thai food and the secret menu with the Islamic dish.... I had to. I had to, ok! Its a 4 minute walk from my office.. which means it's a dangerous place because I'll literally be here all the damn time. 

Place was packed. No resos on Friday. Waited 15 min or so for a table for 3 during lunch rush, wasn't too bad. The place is huuuuge - stretches out to communal tables in the back, which is good for when you have one or two people and don't mind sitting wherever. Food comes out super fast too, especially considering how many people there are. Service was super great and didn't lack according to how many people they were dealing with.

The food was super duper. They had a whole section for vegans/vegetarians and it was great. i had the panang curry with tofu and rice and omg, it was so delicious. I'm having flashbacks on it already. Saucy rice is definitely my thing - I'm a carb queen, you see. You can choose the amount of spice in each dish, but according to my coworkers, it's super inconsistent. 

I wanted to try the mango sticky rice dessert because it's one of the classics, but was too full for anything. Nom, it was soo delish though. This is definitely my new spot."}
{"text":"When they mean spicy, they really mean it. I ordered a chicken dish with a pepper level of 3/5 and each piece was like a fireball in my mouth, I loved it. Fortunately, there's always a waiter walking around refilling your glasses with water.

Lunches will cost you over $10 a dish but its worth it if you're looking for an authentic and spicy Thai experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and seems to be a go to place for a lot of students and people around the Ryerson community. Pretty decent place for your Thai fix. Went with a friend and we ordered some pretty good dishes. Tried the Tom Yum Soup, Crispy Spring Rolls, Chicken Phud Thai and Golden Chicken Curry with Rice. Great dishes in general. The golden curry was quite flavorful and you can taste the coconut in there. The spring rolls were a nice way to start the meal. Personally, I though the Tom Yum soup was way too spicy for me though but I am sure other people would like it. Overall, great dining experience. Staff were friendly and generally it's not too busy if you go early and it's a pretty big place so there's lots of seating. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Yummm looove their golden curry (with 2 chilis). 

Good portions, huge variety. They have some small tables and also communal style seating. 

Minus one star because the buckets under the chair can't really hold a purse aaaand a winter jacket, so it gets a bit difficult. And the service is a tad slow but I guess it was a busy night??"}
{"text":"I have been going to salad king since I was a student at Ryerson...  Back in the day when they were at the spot by the Ryerson bookstore (and they would call out your order number on that ghetto PA system!). Long time ago....  Lol

The thing I like best about salad king:
I can always trust I will get the spice level I need. I am a hardcore spicy food fan and I need it hot!  I order all my dishes 20 chilli here and it's amazing. 

Don't be scared though if crazy hot is not your thing. They have great food for everyone at all spice levels. 

My all time faves: Thai fried rice, Thai basil noodles, golden curry chicken, Sea Queen (squid/calamari)

I loaded some pics of my faves that I had today!  Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Overall, food was good. The service was not good at all - we were constantly ignored and for some reason, we were given two glasses of water each. We were also informed that we cannot adjust the spiciness level of the khao soi because it was \"pre-set\" and we were later told that they ran out of khao soi. Interesting. The seating arrangements were not exactly ideal - I wish there were separate tables instead of sharing one long table with a bunch of strangers. We also had to sit on stools with very little room to store our coats, bags, etc. Would I come back again? Maybe as a last resort."}
{"text":"The food here is good and service pretty quick. It's a decent lunch when you're already downtown. Arrive by 11:30 if you don't want to wait for a table. The khao soi is not very good... go for a curry or pad Thai dish instead."}
{"text":"Extremely poor food over rated the waiting was very long. I will never go back .what is true the price are OK."}
{"text":"A great place if you're looking for quick, tasty & affordable Thai food. I have enjoyed every dish here and my friends and I have eaten here a lot over the years. Just a short walk from Dundas square/Eaton Centre you'll be sure to get good food in a casual, comfortable and clean dining environment."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions since it's conveniently located near the Eaton Centre. We were seated promptly despite how crowded it was due to good organization.  It was a place where it was loud so you dine and head out quickly. I also found it hilarious that there were a lot of witty texts on the wall as part of their decoration. There were lots of stalls for the washroom which is a plus. 

My most to least favourite: 

Green Curry - Beef $8.75 Chicken $9.00 
(broccoli, snap pea, bell pepper, pea, sweet Asian basil in Thai green curry with coconut milk and Thai herbs, served with steam rice)
You can choose the spice level which is really great too. It was a very light curry that primarily had a coconut milk taste so it was really creamy and delicious. The jasmine rice is really well made. 

Crispy Spring Rolls ~$4.00
(cabbage, bean sprout, carrot, bean vermicelli, black fungus, bamboo shoot, wrapped in spring roll shell (made from wheat), deep fried, served with sweet and sour sauce)
They're good. You can't go wrong with these. :) If you grab one of those hole-punched card coupons you find at almost any hotel or tourist destination, these can be complimentary with your meal. 

Thai Noodle Soup ~$7.95
(rice noodle, chicken, shrimp, bean sprout, carrot, onion, coriander and celery in a light chicken broth) had more subtle flavours but was refreshing and I didn't feel thirsty afterwards like with a lot of noodle soups. It's good for a sick day if anything."}
{"text":"If you're a student on a budget, this place is perfect for you.  If you're picky, can't wait, and you need a more comfortable atmosphere, you really want to avoid this place.  Luckily, I'm a student, and I don't care about how loud it gets or waiting in line.  

The food is great for the price you pay.  Some people are saying they hated the food (it was too sweet, sour, whatever) but I think it's just a personal preference thing.  South-east Asians use a lot of sweet/sour+salty combinations in their food, so as a South-east Asian, I have no complaints.  Don't come here if you're not sure if you like that.

I've been here about 3 or 4 times and the only problem I've had was with the atmosphere.  If you just want a cheap meal and don't mind the wait and noise, don't miss this place.  4/5 stars."}
{"text":"I was sad a few years ago when Salad King closed because of fire. The new location is great though! So clean and the servers are friendly. I love the golden tofu and the beer is cheaper than what you'd get elsewhere in the area. Love it!"}
{"text":"I love the golden curry at this place, it is delicious. But the wait times can be quite long sometimes and the service is mediocre."}
{"text":"This is the type of place that was yummy but not refined.

The chicken satay (very juicy chicken breast pieces but the satay sauce needed more peanut flavour and less peanut chunks and the chicken needed more marinate and grill flavour). The islamic noodles were sooo good on the first few bits but then it got too creamy and too rich, making it hard to finish more than half of the dish, a dash of lime would have helped immensely. The pad thai was very yummy as well but lacked on the sour note and was a bit too much on the sweet side. 

In both dishes, the noodles were a tad overcooked and the choice of vegetables was a bit unauthentic (do they even have broccoli in thailand). But overall, its was good and I would come back for some cheap fusion thai food."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place a couple of times after class with my school friends and enjoyed my experiences here.

The last time I ordered a Chicken Coconut Milk (Tom Hai Gai) soup and was a little disappointed at the quality of the meat so I ended up eating around that.

It is located very close to my school and the prices are pretty reasonable. They also have very good drink specials, my friend and I split a 60oz pitcher of Sapporo for $16.99 which was perfect!!

Next time I will be ordering something vegetarian ;) but I will return!"}
{"text":"Slow service, bad food. Soup was sour and mango sticky rice was not fresh tasting at all. Would not come again."}
{"text":"Some solid Thai food. Love the prices for being located at such an urban focal point. The service is good, and the food is prepared quickly, even when the establishment is packed. I will say that it does get really loud though, so keep that in mind if you're looking to do a date as it might be hard to talk at a normal volume. Also, it appears this is a predominantly early adult destination, though I noted a few exceptions. Overall, would probably come back."}
{"text":"I live in Calgary BUT every time I come to Toronto, Salad King is on the menu! Great prices first of all. I know some people have had issues finding tables but I've never had to wait longer than ~10-15 minutes for a table. The Panang Red Curry is especially good. The Pataya Chicken and Kari noodles are a big hit too. Food is always quick and staff always polite and filling up the water cups on time. I've never gone higher than 5 chilis on their spice chart (that was plenty for me!) but friends have tried up to 15. Don't take those warnings lightly, it can get spicy.

So if you're around Yonge/Eaton Center and looking for some good, quick, well priced food, Salad King is the go to place!"}
{"text":"Really hard to complain about this place. Yes it's typically packed on weekends and yes they don't have enough private tables so you end up sitting on a long stainless steel table with other people. 

But they make it all up with quick service, their low prices and delicious food. It's not going to be gourmet thai food from a high end restaurant, but its very tasty. The portions are typically more than I can handle, and as someone who enjoys spice, Salad King comes highly recommended. I've never gone past 7 \"chillies\" on a scale to 25."}
{"text":"Pros: extensive menu, with a variety of spice levels. Plenty of seating, and therefore not too much wait time when waiting for a table. Great location - right on Yonge (enter the building and go up to the 2nd floor). Very colorful, chic interior design. 

Cons: my chicken wasn't super warm when it arrived (though the portion size was huge), and one of the people in our party ordered her Thai with extra spice and it came pretty neutral in terms of spice level. Even the sauce that our waitress later brought her was more salty than spicy.

Overall, the experience was fun, but the food was only so-so."}
{"text":"Golden Chicken or beef or tofu or all three/ Curry with 5 chill's is awesome. Great tasting i usually always order this. Here's a tip go to any hotel in the tourist coupon zone you'll find a coupon to this place get a free egg roll with any order. The egg roll is pretty delicious! Usually do take out dinning in can be very busy and waiting long too. The food is fresh tasting and good. They have a lot of menu i have tried majority. My top pics are any of the curries or pad thai. The Sticky rice mango is DELICIOUS!! They have good food here. It's my to go to place mostly."}
{"text":"My third fav Thai food restaurant in Toronto. No fuss - only good food. The service is not bad, the seating is a bit congested and the ambiance is ok - but where they lack in other stuff, the cover it up on food - awesome food. Also, the price is quite reasonable!"}
{"text":"hands down best thai in toronto. i'm always totally satisfied in the food here, as is my non-thai-food-loving husband (that really says a lot). the place is styled like a cafeteria, though, and it's very loud and full of ryerson students. there's a quiet version of the same restaurant upstairs called Linda, but prices are about twice as much and for me it's not worth it. just be prepared to wait a long time if you are with a big group.

one thing i love is that your glass will never go dry. i always wondered why places that served spicy food had such bad service (you know, your mouth is burning and you can't find the guy with the pitcher of water) but here they're topping off your glass before it's even half empty. gotta love it!

if you have the option, don't go during normal meal hours. i was there today at 1pm and i waited over 1/2 hour just for takeout. it's always totally packed."}
{"text":"Everyone loves Salad King.  It has lots of seats (which are pretty much always full) and as far as Thai food goes, it's very cheap.

Salad King is often lined up, with waits of up to 30 minutes, but people often choose to wait.  They also do take out, but I've been told that take out could take up to 30 minutes, so if you are hoping to by pass the wait by doing take out, know that it's not always a safe bet.  I would recommend that you call ahead, because it's really the best way to save yourself some grief.

Lots of their food is delicious, but my personal favourite is the Siam Noodle.  It comes with a peanut sauce that is a reason in itself to buy this dish."}
{"text":"Good place to go for affordable thai food that still tastes good. I had the pad thai and added a little bit of spice which helped the flavour. They have a full scale of spice levels if that's your thing. I would come back to try a greater selection of dishes as they have a lot of other rice and noodle dishes."}
{"text":"First things first, the pictures on the front of this listing are of the old location, so it could be confusing if you're looking for it.  The new location is across the road and north of the old location.

I used to go to that old location, and missed it during the hiatus following the partial building collapse.

The food is always pretty good, the prices are reasonable, and the portions are large.  I love the Siam noodles and the Golden/Yellow Curry is great too.  There just aren't enough Thai places in Toronto where you can buy Golden Curry.

A few cons for an otherwise great place:
- The young ladies who assign tables and call out names can seem clueless at times.  On one occasion, they insisted that we put our name on the list, although there was a table ready.  They turned around momentarily, and called our name 10 seconds later.  Even though we didn't move in that time, they looked over the crowd behind uswhile calling our name - they obviously had forgotten who we were in the 10 seconds since they greeted us.

- The spice level is inconsistent.  Tonight we had 3 dishes.  One with no chillies, one with 3 chillies, and one with 10 chillies.  The 3 chilly pepper dish was actually hotter than the 10 chilly pepper dish.

- Yes, it's very loud - and crowded.  It comes with the popularity."}
{"text":"I wished I got food here w/o hassle. I wish I got any food at all. My family got and finished their meal and a good 10 minutes goes by before the waitress came by with my food. By that time I was too mad to even eat, so I return the plate, paid and left. Bad service, no food. Completely ruined my night. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great food, be careful choosing the spice level. I couldn't finish the first time I went. Great food and great service though.."}
{"text":"Pretty shit food. Lousy Thai Iced Tea. Their water tastes like pool water... Khao Soi watered down. The Islamic Noodles is not bad. But otherwise not good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai restaruant.  The food there is pretty awesome and also not that expensive. I also found the washroom inside the restaurant is really interesting! 
I always ordered green curry chicken since i really like the milky taste. Other dishes are really amazing too!"}
{"text":"This is a popular place, especially for students as its right across Ryerson University and in the core area of Yonge and Dundas.

I recommend the siam fried rice and phud thai fry noodles in shrimp or chicken. Food here is okay but dont expect the same quality as Khao San Road or Pai restaurant. If you are looking for something more affordable and are in the area, Salad King is a good option to check out. 

If you are new to Salad King you might be surprised at the seating arrangements. They have these long metal tables where you would need to eat next to strangers. This is to fit the maximum number of people in the restaurant. They also added small tables so now you can sit in groups of 4 or so too, however getting seats there are kind of difficult.

Tips: go in smaller groups, its easier to get seating that way. They only do reservations at lunch and you can pick up any food orders there but no delivery.

Great for lunches and dinners with friends, family, coworkers and casual dates. Its pretty loud so don't come here if you have something important to discuss."}
{"text":"Initial visit:
Terrible flexibility. I arrived early and asked to be seated at a booth to order for my friends while i wait. I said they would be here in less than 5 minutes. The waitress in the front was not willing to accommodate and said it was their policy to not seat people unless they all arrive. The entire meal took around 40 mins to serve.

Come here only when they are not full"}
{"text":"I've visited this location many times, each time trying something different, and every time I've been very impressed with the quality of food, service and overall value of the experience.
Entering the facility is quite odd, as it is on the 2nd floor of the building. Space is tight, so on busy nights you may not have much room to manoeuvre. And boy does it get busy (For good reason).

I've tried a few dishes in the past but the most recent one I remember was the Pad Thai, so I'll talk about that. I was able to add both Chicken and Shrimp to my meal, and the server was very accommodating in getting my order the way I liked it. The flavour was very consistent throughout the dish and it tasted very genuine. The portion of my meal was average, as a big eater I usually end up hungry after eating out and this was no exception, but for the price I feel it was worth it. 

Pros:
Good food quality
Good value for thai food
Service is quick and efficient and accommodating (quick turnover)
Decent portion size
Easy accessibility downtown

Cons:
Can be an extremely long wait 
Seats are slightly uncomfortable - Basically sitting on a stool
Can get quite loud
Seating is packed - You can listen to the conversation of the individuals next to you :|"}
{"text":"LOVE the food here. The Thai islamic noodles are just to die for! I always ask for atleast 5 chilis since i love spice in my food but even for those who prefer mild over spicy i would recommend adding just a couple of chilis. It really enhances the flavor. 

Keep in mind that the islamic noodles are only available on the 'Secret Menu'. Other tasty items that are available on their regular menu are the Phud Thai, Panang Curry as well as the Golden Curry!"}
{"text":"Ordered the off menu item \"Islamic Noodles\" and it is by far the best thing they serve! Red curry mixed with pad Thai and just enough spice. 

We went around 5 PM so it was easy to get a table for 6 people. Food came pretty quickly and portion size was definitely more than I could handle! Will for sure be making a return visit next time I'm back in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Today I'll be reviewing Salad King.

I've tried this restaurant about 6x and it's fairly consistent. The name is misleading as it's NOT a salad place. It's actually specializes in Thai Food.
When I'm downtown and hungry for something tasty, filling and that won't cost much this is the place to go.

This place is ALWAYS packed. Every time I go there, it's chaotic and crammed. If you have a problem sitting in close quarters with strangers then I wouldn't suggest coming here. If you do not like loud busy places where it seems like the staff is ALWAYS moving at the speed of lighting...this spot is NOT for you. If you want your dish presented along with the rest of your party...NOT the spot for you. They bring your dishes out sporadically so no waiting until everyone is served to eat. If you do that, your food will be cold.

The food though is ALWAYS ALWAYS DELICIOUS! From the garlic shrimp, spring rolls to the 3 different styles of curries...you will NOT be disappointed. I always eat half and have some for leftovers. On the menu it has heat levels so you can ask for how spicy you want it. I enjoy spicy dishes so 3 was perfect for me. One time I decided to be brave and got heat level 5 and it was TOO much. To the point where I couldn't enjoy it. It's a great spot for plate sharing or just having your own dish. Appetizers range from about $4.00- $8.00 and the meals it's self are usually under $10."}
{"text":"Decent pad Thai and orange chicken but $2 extra for brown rice or $3 extra for noodles seemed like a bit much (orange chicken plate). Beer prices were good though. 

I'm not a huge fan with chairs without backs when I'm trying to relax and enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"My second visit, it was still as packed as ever.

You're almost certain to share the communal table if you're a party of 2. Sometimes, I feel I have to yell across the table in order for my guest to hear me. 

I tried the Tom Hai Gai (coconut chicken soup) and it was too watery for my liking. There was only a tiny hint of coconut flavour.

The Green Curry was tasty, but I still prefer the Punang Curry from my first visit."}
{"text":"One of the best cheap eats in Toronto.  Been coming here since University and will never get tired of the restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely not disappointed. A group of 5 of us visited and server was great.  I ordered the Penang curry chicken with 8 chillies.  It was excellent! Overall decor and ambience was nice.  Was a great spot for a quick lunch.  Everyone in the group enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"The hotel clerk recommended this place for Thai food , and it was a good recommendation !   The place had a great view on the second floor of the building . The tables and seating so comfy and everyone from hostess to then waitress were so friendly and always refilling our drinks .  Service was fast even tho the place was hopping"}
{"text":"Heard lots of hype about salad king. It might be good for university students getting a fast meal but doesn't compare to most Chinese found on Spadina."}
{"text":"Being in a convenient and popular location, the prices are pretty good! I got a delicious green curry that filled me up good! If you're with friends, order the beer tower. It's pretty neat to look at and you get to pour your own drink :) 

Will definitely come back and bring more friends."}
{"text":"3/5

So I finally tried their the famous Islamic noodle. It was a-ok. For quick Thai restaurant, they have pretty decent attentive service. Overall it's not bad. Nothing was bad but nothing really special either."}
{"text":"It's a more casual restaurant with tons of seating and an open kitchen area. It's almost always packed during peak lunch and dinner hours, so expect a wait during those hours. They serve Thai food mainly with their curries and spring rolls being the most well-known dishes. Staff are understandably very busy, but they tend to be very curt, sometimes it almost feels as though you're just ignored, and service does feel quite lacking at time."}
{"text":"Even back in the day when Salad King was literally a hole in the wall and you'd wait for that garbled microphone to call out your number, this place was slinging affordable and authentic Thai food to a constantly packed house.

The reno from hole in the wall to the two floors (Linda is upstairs which will be covered in another review) of sleek and modern design didn't change the food one bit. It's still great food. Feel like snacking? Try the Street Noodle Soups and the Mango Salad. Want something more substantial? Their homemade curries (Panang is my fave), selection of fried rice (Thai Fried Rice = yum) and noodles (Pad Thai is the best in the city) will definitely fill you up but won't empty your wallet. Cap it off with their Mango Sticky Rice and you'll walk away from SK feeling happy and full. 

The only caveat? It's noisy and they don't take reservations so you'll often wait 20-30 minutes for a table. It's worth it though."}
{"text":"Ordered the golden curry and Bangkok stir fry, and found the food to be quite bland. Would not come back."}
{"text":"If I can only eat at one place when I'm in town, it will be Salad King. Always perfect and authentic."}
{"text":"Ah yes. I remember Salad King back when I was a Ryerson undergrad, back when the restaurant was housed in a heritage building at Yonge and Gould Streets. Didn't take long before I discovered why it was so popular in the campus community. I made it a habit to eat there once a month at best.

That was before the wall on the building collapsed and their incompetent landlord did nothing about it for a few months, until one night an arsonist finished the job. Fuck's sakes. I think I worked my way up to chili level 10 before that incident ruined everything. And I hadn't even graduated yet.

Enough of nostalgia. Luckily for the Ryerson crowd (and the Yonge-Dundas universe), Salad King eventually opened again across the street from their original location, on the second floor of the building housing a Foot Locker. Never been there since the incident and reopening, until now.

Me and a friend went up the wee stairs and find ourselves in a shiny spacious space that was quite like the old Salad King, with generous real estate dedicated to tables in communal arrangement. It was mid-day July, and the place was barely full--when the school year's running Salad King is often busy all the time.

I had the plain Kari Noodles. Mmm... great. Flavourful. Spicy. Nostalgic. Comfort. Goodness. My buddy, on my advice, ordered the Thai Islamic Noodles. (there used to be a time when this was a rotating 'weekly special', but is now relegated to that mysterious realm of 'secret off-the-menu items'). Got his thumbs up.

The food comes ripe-hot and fast. The servers sure love to refill your water as quickly as you gulp your cup down. Be sure to always request extra napkins, 'cuz you'll be sweating buckets. Your meal is guaranteed to kick your ass and make your mouth scream... unless I suppose you ordered with a chili level of something mild. Wimp.

I understand much of their stuff is a contemporary take on Thai cuisine, with a big emphasis on hot spiciness, but the food never fails to entertain and satisfy me. And the prices here are still quite affordable--still nothing over $10. Maybe some will regard Salad King as overrated, but you cannot complain about the quality of the food, and for what you are paying, when compared to the crap you could be eating from the crap chain eateries that pollutes this city block (or worse, campus cafeteria grub). Come in a group or come alone, you'll feel quite well here sweating your heart out!

{TTC: From Dundas station, walk north past Gould. Entrance is to the right side of Foot Locker. Nice to know: there is an elevator. Also nice to know: Thai Islamic Noodles.}"}
{"text":"First time here and possibly the last...came with a bunch of friends so it was a little difficult trying to locate something in the area with ok pricing and being able to seat all of us. We had to go to the movies after so the choices aside from food court were limited...

The suggestion was to come here, as downtown isn't my hood.. I don't know it too well...Therefore go with the crowd... 

Its pretty bright with large windows, seating area is reasonable... but the food was what really turned me off... 

The food was overly sweet.. too much sugar in Thai food...hmm... NOOOO....why is there so much sugar and why is it so sweet? curry didn't at all taste like curry... the noodle soup my friend got wasn't looking anything close to what we eat in Thailand.... 

The prices were slightly higher I guess due to location, there isnt a choice... 

All in all, not somewhere I want to come back until I see improving reviews...

Theres alot of places with decent foood 
..come-on... we're talking downtown here not the boonies!! Lol"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends for the Beer Tower and orange chicken. They got my order wrong on the first try, probably because nothing was written down. 
The food was pretty good, but the beer tower was the main event. 
I like the idea and it didn't get too warm, wasn't that flat either. 
All in all it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Great decor. Communal style eating that is fresh and hip. The Chilli rating they have is inconsistent though (been a few times) and when I ordered 3 chillies last time I definitely got something in the 10 chilli range which ruined my meal. Want to give it more stars but that really sucks when you can't eat what you ordered."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends and ordered the yellow curry and it was SOOO good. It had a really rich flavour and went really well with the rice. One of my friends had the islamic noodles which is basically chicken pad thai with coconut curry (it's not on the menu so you have to ask for it) and it was also AMAZING. I strongly recommend either one of those dishes. Yellow curry if you want something small, islamic noodles if you want a big portion. 

We also shared chicken and beef skewers but in my opinion the chicken skewers were better. They make a great appetizer and we were literally fighting over them because they were too good. My only complaint about this place was that the service was really slow and we were waiting a really long time just to get our appetizers.

Also if you want to try this place, go there and sit in. If you order takeout it's still okay but doesn't taste nearly as good as having it fresh."}
{"text":"Real decent for the price.  Went inside and it looked like a typical college hang out, so don't go here with your date, but come with a few buds are you're a-okay.  Had the 1 pepper seafood with coconut curry on rice, it was pretty good.  Server was attentive and nice, on her game.  Left a happy customer.  I work 2 blocks away, if my work place didn't serve free lunch, I'd be here once a week."}
{"text":"great food!
the GOLDEN CURRY is amazing...
awful set up (too loud, too much interaction/listening to others awful conversations; hipsters, boring groups of 20 somethings...)  
OVER PRICED..  would go a lot more if it was cheaper.."}
{"text":"I was here with one of my gf's a little while ago.  I've converted her to siam noodles!  I really like that you can choose the chill rating.  

I'm not a big fan of spicy things ~ mostly b/c I can't stomach it.  I'm a no chilis kind of girl.

The decor looks nice, I like the tables, and you totally can meet random people seated near you...since that's how they roll."}
{"text":"Got chicken pad Thai for takeout. Spiciness level 3 was my preference. Portions are massive! Food is good. Service is good."}
{"text":"I had always been a fan of Salad King before Pai came into the picture. Salad King is great for fast Thai food and I really enjoyed when I was a student at Ryerson. Ever since Pai and other China noodle restaurants, Salad King just didn't seem so good anymore.

Thai Basil noodles - if you call it Thai basil, I expect the dish to have more Thai basil. Instead, there was probably 1-2 basil leaf stir fried in my noodles and a whole bunch of raw leaves for me to add myself. Otherwise, it was a good dish.

Shrimp and cashew - My boyfriend got sucked into the cashews but he was not expecting the watery sauce that came with it... Too much sauce??

Mango sticky rice - mango should be cut smaller! Nothing else to say about it haha."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service - they delivered the wrong sauce for Islamic noodle which loose it's point of ordering this food because the sauce is the key for this dish. All they told me was to go to the delivery company and they gave me no apology. When I went to the restaurant to pick up the sauce, the manager automatically thought that I work there just because I'm Asian. I was expecting for a sincere apology or at least pretending to give one. They didn't care anything I said. I recommend Salad King to read customer service books to study customers' psychology. After I mentioned the escalation and went back to the restaurant, the manager finally offered me something to make me quiet. I am very disappointed in this restaurant especially when I only talked good things about them in the past when my friends said Salad King is like cafeteria Thai food. Their customer service is for sure same or below cafeterias  #customerservicefailed"}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday night and it was PACKED. I had really high expectations for the food. I heard about the must-order secret menu item: islamic noodles so of course, I had to get it. 

The portions were HUGE and the food itself was good, but not great. If you like spice, I'd definitely recommend upping the amount of spice you get because I got one pepper and I couldn't taste anything (even though I'm usually a wimp when it comes to spicy food). I found that the flavour was flat and not too exciting. But maybe I've just had too much Pai."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed. The spicey beef tasted watered down. Other than being spicey it had no flavour. The one chili was very hot... The chicken dish also was one chili but not as spicy as the beef."}
{"text":"My memories of Salad King are entrenched in romantic haze of an exciting and new Toronto when I first came on a lightning visit years ago. Before Fire. Once I relocated permanently to Toronto, I never visited back. It was a great experience, time to soak up other Toronto adventures. Then came the fire. Then came the re-build. Then I finally returned. Yesterday.

Its new location is a modern, trendy, large space. Its rustic charm has been replaced by shiny, clean, fast service. It appeals to the student base nearby and the tourists congregating in nearby Dundas Square.

My group ordered pad thai, shrimp delight, and chicken cashew that I can recall. I ordered the chicken cashew, 5 chili spice ranking. It was....bland. It could have benefited from 5 more chili rankings.  

While my group enjoyed their respective meals, I could not help but think my memory of Salad King is now tainted with the reality of bad food. My challenge now, is to find a better Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Really great vibe especially if you're looking for something cheap in the area - $9 for a full delicious Thai dinner. 

Really fast service, comfortable, modern decor. Great place for a casual meal if you're looking to beat the pub fare that dominates Yonge St.

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service! The server was polite and served us quickly. The Phud Thai was flavourful and nicely spiced. The only issue was their tap water. Not something people most complain about, I know, but their glasses were plastic green tumblers, covered in scratches. The water tasted like the plastic was leaching into the water. I ended up ordering jasmine tea which was good."}
{"text":"Upon entering, I thought the waitress standing at the front was kinda rude. They did not acknowledge us until we stood in front of them asking for a table of 3. 

Aside from that, our waiter was nice and the food was good. It was our first time here, but I've been hearing from friends that their Pad Thai is good, so we order Pad Thai with chicken, Mango Chicken, Golden Curry, and Mango Salad. We all opted for mild spiciness level (we weren't too sure how spicy their spiciness is lol). 

The Pad Thai was good, I like it more than other places. It wasn't as red as I expected and the noodles were chewy. The Mango Chicken smelled really strong and the taste was a little sweet. I liked it, but I can see it as a hit or miss for some depending on their taste buds. The Golden Curry was really good! The chicken was tender and the sauce and everything was full of flavour. I wish I asked for more chili though cause it would have tasted better (I'll know for next time!) The Mango Salad was a little meh. It's the only place I know that doesn't ads peppers and there's actual Mango sauce. I didnt mind it cause it was sweet and the Mango itself was actually pretty sour..but I probably won't order it again. 

The food portion was good and the price was decent. I'll probably be back next time to try out their secret menu item: Islamic noodles?!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty ghetto.
Had their sweet and sour soup, and their soup had an off sour taste to it. Of course, returned it. 
I had one of the noodle dishes, which was good, but the chicken tasted very old, so unfortunately the extra couple of dollars I spent, was pushed to the side of the plate. 

Its a great place for cheap and lots of food. But dont expect anything from this place other than getting full."}
{"text":"I went to Salad King a lot because a friend of mine from Kingston likes this place. But they have been going downhill lately and I am boycotting them at the moment because of a few incidents. During my last visit, I ordered Siam Fried Rice (my favourite fried rice on the menu) with 1 chilli. My sister ordered the same dish with 3 chillis. But guess what? Mine was spicer than hers, it felt like 5 chillis. I tried eating it despite being spicy but i couldn't take it after maybe 5 bites. I told the waitress and asked if it's okay if they fixed it -  she said yes so she sent the dish back and when it came back, it was the same dish, except it was warmer! I was so mad i had to force myself to eat half of it because I was hungry! You don't mess with a hungry me! NO!

Also, I remember this one time I ordered Basil Chicken and guess what? There were barely any basil in my dish! My friend ordered another dish that has basil in it and she had more basil than mine! So why is it called BASIL Chicken then?

Salad King is very inconsistent with its cooking and that is one thing I HATE. 

I wanted to give them 1 star but because they are okay sometimes, I have to be fair."}
{"text":"I'm a lover of all food that is Thai so of course I loved Salad King. It's really cute and set up in a cafeteria style. The service is quite fast and the portions are pretty big. I ordered the pad thai with 5 chillies and it was very spicy but I really liked it.

I took away one star because:

1) the wait times can be quite long
2) the waiting areas are really tiny 
3) I'm all for personal space; it gets a little uncomfortable sitting right beside a stranger as you eat your meal (b/c they are cafeteria tables)
4) for a simple place, the prices are comparable to Spring Rolls (a fancier thai place)

But overall, a great place for a quick meal"}
{"text":"I've been going to Salad King for years. It's a good and reliable choice for thai-asian food.

It's conveniently located, reasonably priced, and they have a wide variety of dishes. 
I enjoy the Garlic shrimp and Siam noodles. The Islamic noodles, not listed on their menu, is also a go-to choice. Ask for spicy! 
I always need to add hot sauce for flavour.

I would recommend this place for lunch or a very casual after-work dinner! Prices are between $10-12 :)
It is normally pretty busy and the seating is communal cafeteria style."}
{"text":"I never had a chance to go to the old location, and then it burned down. It was a sad day as soooo many of my friends would rave about the mighty Salad King and how amazing their Pad Thai was.

Finally had a chance to hit up their new location the other night... There's a long trek up some flights of stairs, which makes you feel like you're hitting a night club as the crowd gets increasingly louder. We were greeted by a pleasant woman who sat us down in a nice booth location. The place was quickly filling up and everyone who arrived after us were crammed at communal tables, where couples had to sit rather close to other couples. Would not be my ideal choice of seating.

A girl dropped of some cups of water and seconds later our waiter arrived. He was super nice and ordering was a snap. Our appetizers seemed to magically appear minutes later, and our main dishes shortly followed. I had the Golden Tofu Curry and it was pretty good -- about as good as any other I've had at Thai restaurants. Overall we enjoyed our food and the final bill was rather cheap in my mind, but the portion sizes seemed about right for that figure.

I liked the washrooms: individual unisex stalls with your own sink. Everything was automated so I didn't touch a thing really. And on this occasion they seemed to smell kind of nice.

I like Salad King. The location is not really an area I am around very often, but I think it would definitely be a top choice if I am ever in that hood and want to take someone out for a nice meal."}
{"text":"One of my fave restaurants. Great price! Delicious food and good service. Too bad it's a little far from my campus... But it's worth the trip. 

Every time I'm downtown with friends we always end up here. Never fails.

Sometimes it's a bit too busy. They need more locations ;)"}
{"text":"Went with a bunch of friends after boardgames. This place was packed (I haven't been there on a weekday but this place is always packed every time I visited).  My friends ordered noodles and ordered rainbow chicken stir fry - 18 stars spicy **. I wanted 15 stars, however waitress explained that the food is originally 3* spicy, so it will be 18. Food was good ... a bit spicy (felt like the spice overwhelmed the flavor) but not bad."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in so long. They expanded and have more tables now. The service is quick and we got our food right away. We ordered the Thai ice tea, khao soi, and phud Thai. Since my Thai food taste bud has evolved from trying khao San road and pai, I was anticipating salad king not to be as good. To my surprise, it wasn't as bad as I thought. The Thai ice tea wasn't too sweet, but didn't have enough tea flavor, the phud Thai was actually pretty good. Good authentic phud Thai flavouring. Wished there was more chicken in it though. The khao soi wasn't as good as the other restaurants that I mentioned. The chicken was tender, but the curry itself was more watery than flavourful. The total bill came up to $26. Honestly, a steal for 2 people for lunch. Food was decent and you are done in less than an hour."}
{"text":"The Islamic noodles are a MUST. So delicious and not on the menu. I'm a fan of their food but I think their portion sizes could be more generous. I also feel like every time I come here, the servers seem completely overwhelmed. Overall, this is a good place to come if you're craving quick Thai food!"}
{"text":"So spicy.  For the price the place can't be beat.  I would say it's much better than Pi Toms near Yonge and College and cheaper."}
{"text":"Fast, awesome, simple thai food. great portion sizes, affordable prices, fantastic as leftovers.

no air of pretentiousness here, unlike other thai places in toronto. careful with the chilis you can add - it seems to depend on the whims of whoever places them in. I've had 5 chili dishes that were hotter than the 15 chili dish i ordered once."}
{"text":"I remember the first time I walked by Salad King and thought to myself \"I am definitely never going to eat here\" and now 5 years later and numerous trips after, here I am again, eating and reviewing Salad King. I stopped in on Saturday afternoon for some lunch while staying close by. The place had a good amount of people and usually will unless you come when they first open. This place has a massive inside and a ton of seating, although a lot of it is extremely uncomfortable thanks to most of the seating lacking any sort of back support. The menu here can best be described as Asian Fusion and offers a ton of options from Thai and Chinese to a good number of salads and tofu dishes. I ended up ordering the orange chicken (original, I know) and it only took about 10 minutes to come out (this place is usually super fast). The chicken itself was filled with flavour and delicious. The rice that went with it was basic rice but when mixed with the orange sauce was oh so good. The portions here are not massive, but they are what they should be. I have never left Salad King feeling hungry, I leave feeling good about the meal I ate. 

Overall, Salad King is a fantastic place to eat if you are in the Dundas Square area. You get quality food at reasonable prices and you can leave here knowing you didn't eat like a trash can. I highly recommend this place to anyone spending an afternoon/night downtown!"}
{"text":"Salad King is my go-to spot when I'm downtown and want to find a quick & cheap eat. Meals are usually less than $10. I usually get the pad thai. Service is quick and your meal comes very quickly. The restaurant is a bit noisy and mostly populated with students. The tables are close together."}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant before it burned down because the way the seats are set up reminds me of the days my brothers took me to little restaurants back in Korea, when I was like....6.

I was mortified to find that this was in the building that had burnt down and was about to go into pout mode when my observant friend found the restaurant across the street.

THANK GOODNESS FOR HIM; A HUNGRY SHYNI IS A BITCH.

I LOVE IT MORE NOW - THE NEW DECOR IS FABULOUS. 
i LOVE the cheeky posters/ murals whatever - they make me laugh. 
I love the washroom door that says that is the way to true happiness  - finally someone agrees that washroom relief is really second to very few - I particularly love the girl in the signage that crosses her legs... because truly, no girl desperately in need to go to the washroom, stands in perfect stance...as so many washroom signage lead you to believe.
I love the open space  concept... love the colours....I would come just for the decor, really.

WARNING: BELIEVE THE WAITRESS WHEN SHE SAYS THAT ONE CHILI IS HOT.

LOOK AT MY PICTURE OF THE FOOD I HAD; it is deceivingly mild looking. THAT is a ONE chili. I am  no foreigner to spicy food- heck, I believe there to be some genetic tolerance for spice built into my body, seeing that the main dish in Korean food is Kim chi and that,can be some spicy shit.

This dish was delicious - but the temperature of the food raised the spicy level even higher and by the time i was full, my nose and eyes were running a marathon.
I realized the next day that, even when the food is cold - that didn't help the spiciness - my mouth caught fire on the 3rd spoonful - thank goodness there was only 5 more bites left.

The only downfall of this place: they have NO cold spring rolls which caused me to give it a 4 star. If you're reading this, Mr. ownerman of Salad king, please add cold spring rolls (with carrots, lettuce, cilantro, vermi noodles and shrimp) and you will be promptly upgraded to 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is fun and fast (at least from the point you get seated.)  I love the colourful decor and whimsy of it.  Most of the seating is large communal tables - a plus in my book as I love meeting strangers.  Additionally they have separate tables for when you want to go with a group and have some privacy."}
{"text":"It's a mainstay for Toronto lunches, is always packed, and it's also become a place where people use it as a contest.  We are talking Salad King.  Just off the core of downtown, it's pretty much walking distance from anywhere in the core, reason being that you'll find that folks will make the journey, no matter how far, to get there.

A booming take-out service and a rapid sit-down-anywhere table service gets you your food fast.  The place is clean, modernized, and swarming with staff that buzz about getting you to you table and ensuring that you're seated and eating as soon as possible.  Salad King has a huge array of Asian dishes, but the specialty is the noodle dishes, particularly the Pad Thai.  Where the gaming comes in is the heat.  You are able to select the number of \"peppers\" (a heat scale used by the kitchen) to make your dish as mild or as brutal as you like.  This is where the spicy food eaters get puffy chested and boast about the fact that they can eat a \"15\" at Salad King, knowing full well that in all probability, the scale is sliding for the Caucasian customer.

Regardless, it's good eats."}
{"text":"Salad King is a decent Thai restaurant. I like how it's in the core of downtown but that also makes it tough since a lot of people go here. It's always busy! And the wait time is not too bad but you basically end up sitting beside random people if it's rush hour time. The smell of the place is horrible, especially cause the odour that particular day smelled like something had gone spoiled. The 4 seaters without the booths are so uncomfortable cause there's no back part to rest on which sucks but the booths are nice! 

The food itself was good. I was happy with the main meals. I got the veggie fried rice and Kari noodle which was good, especially the rice. The Kari noodle needed more flavour cause the curry flavour was not as great I expected it to be. Desserts were not good at all but Overall not a bad place!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite restaurant in Toronto! I have been coming here since my first year in Ryerson University (9 years ago) and it has remained my fav restaurant since! 

I usually get the Hot Thai noodles, panang curry, golden curry or Thai fried rice and everything I've had is very good! Picking the spiciness is a great idea! I started pretty low and have worked my way up to 5! (Tried 20 once... I cried) 

Also the mango sticky rice is SO good~

Love this place! The decor is so amazing and funny and staff is always super friendly! Already can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"My first time back to this restaurant after their move across the street.

Other than the new renovations, the experience was essentially the same - cafeteria style sitting, elbow to elbow with strange neighbours, a level of loudness that makes conversations largely inaudible.  I did notice an expanded seating area to better handle the crowd capacity & private booths and tables in one section (so you can wait for these if you prefer this option). I have to say that for small groups of 2-4, you get seated & served pretty quickly.

In terms of food, I think salad king does a pretty good job with its core dishes- by this I mean its curries, satays and pad thais. The food is well seasoned & quite tasty.  I'm not sure if i would call the food authentic Thai, but I think they do a good job regardless.   My only comment with regards to core dishes is that the restaurant seems to be cutting back on ingredients. I ordered the panang chicken curry and noticed that it seemed to have a lot of sauce but lacking in chicken.... Likewise, I checked out my neighbour's shrimp pad Thai and noted the obvious lack of shrimp.

As for appetizers, I think they are average at best. I didn't love the mango salad or mini shrimp rolls- mango salad was pretty dry & shrimp rolls overfried.

Everything said, however, I would go back to salad king although it wouldn't be at the top of my list. Service is decent, but don't go if you expect to have an intimate conversation with your buddy. And forego ordering appetizers- its really not worth it."}
{"text":"The long picnic-like, metal tables give the instant impression that the restaurant is clean, fast and no-frills.  The pad thai is solid, and the restaurant just delivers on what it's decor promises: good thai food, quickly and without being expensive.  Plus the common-table sitting lets you meet fun, new people if that's your thing.

A word of warning: the chili scale goes from 0-20, with the upper regions (15-20) being reserved from east asian natives and drunk frat boys.  There is a story out there of such a frat boy going for level 20 chilis, and having to be stretchered out due to projectile vomiting (consider yourselves warned!).

If you like it hot, or can contain your chili enthusiasm, then this is a great place to grab lunch!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch. The Beef Satay appetizer is good, but expensive. The peanut sauce that it came with was delicious. Ordered a Papaya Salad and was not impressed. Street Noodle Soup was really good. They have different degrees of hotness. The menu/waitress exaggerates how hot their food is. Hot Thai Noodles were good too. Good portions for the entrees. Wait staff is friendly, but impatient (probably due to high business volume). Restaurant is loud, but not noisy."}
{"text":"Salad King has been one of my fav value-for-money thai restaurants for over three years now. I love that the menu is vegetarian/vegan friendly. You can even make the non-veg curries with a veg gravy if you only eat certain types of meat or dislike the fish sauce in gravies like I do. My faves are the Panang tofu curry and Islamic Thai noodles with veggie gravy. Their mango sticky rice is delicious too! The portions are fairly large and are at a good price point."}
{"text":"Hard to believe I use to like this place. Had the Islamic Noodles from their not so secret \"secret menu\" and ended up eating only half of it. The noodles were oily and mushy while the chicken tasted rubbery and artificial. Will probably return however as the location is convenient and it is easy to get a table."}
{"text":"Number 2 place for Thai in Toronto.  It serves up some of the best curry in Toronto.  Want something hot? Salad King will serve it up for you! New location  has excellent seating."}
{"text":"The coconut chicken soup was good. 

The Islamic Noodles wasn't as good as the hype. It was a bit soggy and I don't remember much prominent flavor..."}
{"text":"Food, as always, was great, and it arrived fast, but took forever to pay so dropped a star.. It is nice that they'll split a pitcher price between the people in your group.."}
{"text":"Update review:
Recently on Canada day I was there with a friend and had exact thing what I always get: rainbow chicken. 
Had horrible diarrhea for the next 36 hours! So much regret!

Another update:
The pink hair hostess was so rude. I can't wrap my head around as why she's so bad at such a simple job.. We arrived in the afternoon, the restaurant was not busy at all, nobody was in the line. She was standing behind the greeting table, me and my boyfriend waited few minutes for her to give us a seat as she was standing there looking away at nothing. We eventually waved at her and said Hi and she said Hi back WHILE looking away still... Later she led us to a table in the back and we requested to sit next to the window. She looked so annoyed but eventually led us there. For this entire time she looked angry and didn't smile once. Also we watched her led other parties to their seats, not that she looked like she hates this job, We saw a couple left because of her service. I like the food here and I always been a fan of this place. I don't want to give up just because the terrible service. If a manager is reading this, please act fast and hire people who are qualified."}
{"text":"It used to be tastier they've downgraded their quality.. its more like a luncheon eatery than anything"}
{"text":"Long live the king!

Absence definitely made the heart grow fonder. In the good old days, I took this place for granted. Today, I was SO excited for my lunch date with the king. 

It didn't disappoint. Got the emerald curry, big portion, still cheap and still good. The tofu was fried up REAL nice. My friend got the golden curry and demolished it. Approval all around.

I went at 12:45 and there was no wait time, but the place was packed. The new decor is pretty funky, lots of brightly coloured murals celebrating salad king. The interior is definitely larger than before and there are booths now, but sadly I missed out and had to sit at the cafeteria style tables. 

Although the caf style tables are definitely a 'cool' and 'trendy' concept, and allows them to serve way more people - you have to shout at your lunch or dinner mate in order to be heard. That's the only negative."}
{"text":"We went here today for lunch and the service was bad. You get mediocre service here. The server just quickly gets your order and brings your food. When we ask for fork, spoons and chop sticks for our take out food. She said for us to go to the front counter to get it = so lazy. She did this right after we finished tipping her. I would not tip if I were to go eat here again if I am very desperate to come back. We even complained the the manager which didn't seem to care. He just said sorry and gave us our spoon, fork and chopsticks. He didn't even ask who the server is to investigate and talk to her after for coaching. This place is just too packed & busy. So not worth tipping here and I would not come back. Maybe I would only order take out and quickly leave if I am desperate to eat here again. I heard there are other better Thai food around like Thai Fantasy for cheaper prices, nicer environment and way better service!"}
{"text":"Giiiirl, I swear Salad King is better than I remembered! I have been having major cravings for MONTHS but I'm rarely downtown.  So fiiinally, my friend  and I had planned a day downtown.  He had never been to Salad King before and we're kinda into the same food, so I knew he would like it.  I hoped!

It was a Saturday and we got there around 2:00.  Thankfully it wasn't too packed and we were seated right away.  They have quite a bit of seating to be honest.  It did fill up quite fast though and by the time we were leaving it was packed!  We got served waters right away but it took awhile for our server to come back and take our orders.  I had to find him and flag him down.  He did apologize for the wait. The food also took a bit of time to come out but wow, the goodness of the food, made all these irritated feelings disappear.  I got the golden curry and my friend got the phud thai.  I LOVED both!! I love how the curry comes with a bunch of veggies AND chicken.  The sauce is a peeerfect texture.  Not too thick and not too soupy AND packed with flavout!  It's the perfect amount too.  I wasn't too full but I wasn't left hungry.  I also had a few (a lot) bites of my friend's phud thai and it was sooo much better than I remembered from my college days.  I love the tofu in the dish, as well as, the sauce.  My friend absolutely enjoyed it and said he would get it again.  I'm craving again as I am typing this.  Portion is pretty hefty too.  There's no way I'd be able to finish that in one sitting. 

Hey Salad King!  Open another location in the Peel Region please!!  Why must you be so hectic to get to!?"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner. The seating waitress was outright rude and disrespecting to customers. No smiles and no greetings. 
Our waitress was however very friendly. Attentive and gave us what we needed just in time. 

Food has been consistent. Seafood fried rice was overly sweet. Other items were decent. One kid enjoyed the food but the younger one was not a fan. Restaurant is always loud. Can barely carry out a conversation. I think that's their intention, to get you in and out quick so they can turn over the tables fast.

One thing that has always been strange is their \"bleach flavoured water.\"  My threat was hurting after drinking a lot of their water."}
{"text":"So many friends have recommended Salad King, so I was really looking forward to trying it out. I wasn't expecting the crazy, bustling atmosphere, which I attributed to the workday lunch rush, nor the canteen seating. We were a party of two with a party of three next to us. Someone who was eating alone then got placed in the empty seat in the middle, which seemed a bit uncomfortable and cramped. 

Despite the large amount of customers, the service was prompt. There seems to be a good operational system in effect. I ordered the Islamic noodles with chicken, which tasted great. The portions were probably double of what I usually eat, so I had plenty of leftovers. I asked for my dish to be made non-spicy, but it still had a tinge of spice, so be cautious if you prefer not to have a spicy meal or have low spice tolerance like me.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience, and would definitely come back given its convenient location and affordable food."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner on a Saturday. Very busy already by 5pm. Terrific food and excellent service. The waitress we had (her name is Kasia) was very skilled, sweet, and quick to respond to our various requests. We had a party table of 12 people and we all had a great time. Portions were very generous for the price. Very impressed. Loud-ish ambience but not unbearable. Will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Have you ever wondered why a place with only two salad dishes on their menu would be called Salad King? Hahaha, just a thought.

Not to be confused by the name, this is indeed a Thai restaurant. The décor of this place is made to look like a modern canteen. 

We had a party of 8, but they would not seat us until a majority of our party showed up. Kind of silly since we arrived at 4:30pm, and it was not busy at all. We had 6 people and they finally seated us. We had stools where we sat with no storage under them, so we ended up having to hold our jackets and put our bags on the floor etc. I didn't really like that. 

The service was shotty to start, but got better as our meal progressed. It took a little long to flag down someone to come and take our orders. Food arrived quickly though, and it was pretty good. My husband and I had the green chicken curry and pad thai to share, both with 3 chili spice level which was enough to make me sweat a bit. We also had spring rolls and skewers to start. Both were really good. The server told us that the spring rolls were freshly rolled and the shrimp spring rolls were bought frozen and advised us to order the spring rolls instead. Appreciate the honesty.

Overall, good place for Thai food."}
{"text":"Alright food, okay prices, polite service, nice place to sit down and eat if you get a booth. Had a nice time catching up with friends. But I didn't much care for the food, so I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good location just upstairs. Good atmosphere. Decent food. 

It's great if you're in a hurry to catch a movie or show. One thing I was not a fan of was the communal tables and how the people sitting around you were so close. Practically no privacy. I remembered sitting next to a couple who looked like they were on their first date. 
The chairs have cubbies for you to put your jacket/bag if you need to.

I was disappointed in the street noodle soup I usually order. The last few time I went, the portion was just right. Right amount of soup, noodles, vegetables and shrimp. However, during my most recent visit, I thought it was way too many noodles. What made it even worse was the girl over at the next table ordered the same thing as me and had the write proportion. I was not so pleased. 
Overall, the food was good and portions were on the heavy side. Thought there was too much noodles on one plate."}
{"text":"Wow, the loudest restuarant i've ever eaten in, but amazing food!"}
{"text":"Decent Thai fast food spot near the Eaton Centre. It's still a sit-down restaurant with table service, even though it feels like a fast food place. 

I had the Khao Soi, egg noodles in soup. The flavours were rich and strong. I loves the crispy noodles on top. Portion size was huge! I packed it home and had enough for lunch the next day. 

My brother had the Siam noodles. The dish wasn't very photogenic, but I assure you it tasted good. 

We were seated at a communal table, and it was pretty cramped with people on both sides sitting right next to us. There was also no room to put our bags or coats... They were very busy that day, so that may be why service was so slow. We had to ask multiple times to get water re-fills and waited a very long time to get our bill."}
{"text":"One of my favourite thai restaurants, conveniently located near Yonge and Dundas. All of their fried noodles are pretty good but I would recommend the Islamic noodle with chicken or just with veggies - not printed on their menu but most people seem to know about it. Delicious delicious delicious! Downside: the communal seating and the price point that's a bit on the higher side for noodles."}
{"text":"It's always crowded and with a great deal of students, yappers, and cutesy-phone-case-tap-typers kawaii whiners, but the food does make it worth it. Having the spicy option really is a game changer and keeps the restaurant unique. Probably my favourite thai in the city -- and cheap, to boot."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions, and I have to say that the experience is good only if I am able to sit at an actual table.
Being in the long tables laid out there is quite uncomfortable during the peak hours...I do not want you to hear the conversation I'm having with people, nor do I want to hear about your boyfriend cheating on you. The layout is really strange in these, so try and request for a separate table if you can.
Peak hours can leave you waiting for a while...so plan for that.

In terms of the food, I have to give it a 4/5 as well since it does quite well to satisfy your taste buds if you know what to order. I'm not saying it goes for authentic thai or anything, but it does leave you satisfied after. I generally prefer the curries with 5 chillies (I have a high tolerance for spice)."}
{"text":"Salad King is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Toronto! The service is fast, they have large portions and of course delicious food. The ambiance is not conducive to conversations so I would not recommend this restaurant for a first date but if you are in the neighborhood looking for a quick bite, this place is great as they are very fast. I usually order the tom yum soup to start, unlike other restaurants, you can taste their ingredients and their broth is very clear. Their satay skewers are also delicious and their peanut sauce is always fresh. With any of their curries, you can customize how spicy you would like it. I've tasted their green curry and panang curry and find both a good choice. Their chicken and vegetable portions are equal and of course there is rice provided to pour all that sauce over. Their Bangkok stir fry is also a good option for those who prefer noodles and their street noodle soup is a lovely soup based, noodle dish for cold days like today."}
{"text":"MANGO STICKY RICE!

I have been visiting Toronto for the last few days, my cousin suggested this place for us to go for lunch and am I ever glad she did! I love Thai food, so I was expecting a good menu and a busy spot.

What I got was so much better! The place is huge! It takes up the second floor, with great art work and wall murals, one of which says SERENITY NOW! Hahaha Seinfeld! 

So we ordered some crispy spring rolls to start, my cousin ordered the siam noodle something...and her man and I both ordered pineapple chicken with rice, medium spicy! 

Everything was delicious! Though the sauce that came with the spring rolls had a bit too much vinegar to my liking. I have an issue with my eyes being bigger than my stomach, and only got half of the pineapple chicken. 

The service was lovely, we had regular water refills and our meals came out very fast!

Now, because of the issue I have with my eyes and my stomach, so unfortunately I had to take my mango sticky rice to go...which was such a shame, because it was so warm and delightful. By the time I got to eat it, all of the warm goodness had disappeared...still amazing, but hey, my fault. 

I'm totally going back next time I come visit, just for the mango sticky rice. :)"}
{"text":"Great place if you know what you're getting into. 

The seating is cafeteria style. So expect a lot of unfamiliar faces. Conversations may be challenging but the food makes up for it. 

Excellent service, great food, fun and different ambience. Bathrooms need some more attention. 

Have a great meal :)"}
{"text":"You know that saying: \"Thai food is Asian food for white people\"?

I really never understood that line - the flavouring on Thai cuisine is really intense (I mean the balancing of sweet/sour/salty/spicy -- not this odd perception that Thai food has to be spicy).  Even though Thai food is made for Western cutlery (no chopsticks!), the individual portioning (most Asian meals are 'family style') and there's less focus on 'offal' meat than most other Asian cuisine - I don't understand the popularity for Western palettes.

However, Salad King has pretty much perfected the Thai formula for a Western audience - it's pop and tries to be all things to all people.  If you doubt me, check out the line-up for this Salad King on any given night.

While Salad King isn't bad by any means - it's really mall food court Thai served in a slight nicer dining room.  The portions are big and most people don't really care that it's relatively bland (adding spice to a dish is the same as drizzling hot sauce on anything).

When I'm hungry, I usually grab takeout from Salad King - the off-menu Islamic noodles (chicken pad thai with a coconut curry) is the go-to.  It's not the best Thai, but the portions are big and their takeout system is down to a science.  It's perfectly serviceable, but not much more beyond that."}
{"text":"Crowded, definitely not a \"romantic\" place to go

Nice food though, a lot of veggie options and good prices for down town"}
{"text":"The food is pretty average but Salad King offers the option to choose your own level of spiciness (ranging from 1 to 20 chillis).

The pad thai is pretty good but is a little saltier than I would have liked. My friend had the green curry and said it was the best curry on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here during their soft opening weekend.  Boy, I missed their food.  

There weren't that many people that day (possibly because not many people knew about their soft opening - all hail twitter!).  It was half an hour before closing time and we managed to grab a seat (actually there were many seats).  However, I heard from my friend today that he went at lunch for take-out and that there were so many people that they ran out of tofu

The hostess was a little off her game - but it was the soft opening.  I can't complain.  Our waitress greeted us with a friendly smile and was great.

The décor is pretty interesting - my friend and I were giggling at the sayings/words on the wall.  I think they were trying to go for the funky, but instead, it was a bit tacky - but still enjoyable.  The seats are pretty interesting - you can put your jackets/purses under the seat.  However, they were a bit difficult to stuff your stuff underneath and to take it back out afterward.

I ordered myself the Thai Islamic Noodles - not on the menu; it's like they have a secret menu or something.  The most delicious thing you'll ever eat.  It's basically rice noodles with their panang curry.  You seriously cannot go wrong with this dish at all.  My hankering for Thai Islamic Noodles has now been satisfied and I need not to head to Linda for it anymore.

I'm just so glad that Salad King is back and running!  Long live the king!"}
{"text":"I am a regular here, but the male host was unpleasant and rude on Victoria Day. 

When we walked in, he said \"are you sure you want to eat here?\" Then after we asked if we can sit beside the window. He replied \"I do not want to deal with the shxt right now.\"

I know he probably had a bad day, but that's not how you serve the customer."}
{"text":"Fast. Comparably low prices. Selectable spice levels. Variety of dishes.  Both our dish (curry and pad thai)was just ok.  Place was too crowded and had uncomfortable seating."}
{"text":"Hurray! Salad King has returned!! It was a sad time when I couldn't go to Salad King and get the panang curry or the Bangkok noodles!

I like that they still have the communal table, which makes us somewhat reserved Torontonians talk to each other. It's a neat mix of people in Salad King. 

Our server was totally fabulous (shoutout to Jocelyn!) and let us know that the food is spicier than it used to be. For example, I used to order my food with 3 chilli spice, but now I've discovered (with a slightly bruised ego and smaller sense of personal toughness) that I am only able to enjoy medium. sigh.

BUT it was still awesome. And when they get their liquor licence I look forward to washing it all down with tasty beer!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I will defiantly go back next time I'm in town. Nice casual Thai, the prices are good and the best thing is that they let you adjust the spice to your liking."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since it was located across the street. This week the waitress won't give us a table, until all my 3 friends show up. 1 minute later, my second of 3 showed up, We ask for a table she still refuses, in a rude manner. We ask for the manager, so this guy named Jason, said i have been manager here only 2 months, we make lots of sales.. so I don't care and calls the elevator for us. very rude behaviour from management. I even smell racism in the way they dealt with us. We will never go there again, the week before it the food quality was bad. Sounds like bad new management who don't know what are they doing."}
{"text":"Great thai food at awesome prices!  Returned for a visit after an 8 year hiatus and 3 stores later, salad king still rocks and manages to out Thai the competitors! Love the ambiance and atmosphere!  Awesome location right on yonge street too!"}
{"text":"As an almost daily visitor to their original location, I was happy to finally have the opportunity to stop by at their new swanky spot (not so new or swanky, but comparative....)

I almost wish I hadn't, therefore leaving my memories of Salad King intact as the royalty of inexpensive and ample Thai food.  

Husband and I met for an early lunch and decided to order extra for dinner that night.  Ordered the Spicy Beef, Lime Leaf Chicken and the Islamic Noodles, all 5 chili.    I remember 5 chili's making me beg for a glass of milk, this time around, not even a slight flush.   The good news is that they use fresh chili's, 5 chili's means they cut up 5 chili's in your dish and I guess, this particular day, their batch of chili's was kindergarten mild.  

They are getting two stars because the meat was very suspect to the point where neither of us wanted to eat it.  Bad flavour, texture and consistency.  We didn't complain because I am pretty sure it wouldn't have made a difference.    I hate suspect meat, I mean, really, who doesn't? 
This was unfortunate because the favours of the sauces were wonderful.    

The place is spotlessly clean, the gentleman server we had was super friendly.  We went on a Monday and I am pretty sure we just got left over meat from the weekend. The rice also has a similar  leftovers feel to it.  Regardless, the King is dead to me."}
{"text":"I have some pretty fond memories of this place, as it was our go-to during my years as an undergrad student in the area. While the food can be on and off (i.e. don't get the veggie spring rolls, unless you like the bland defrosted kind), it's been mostly \"on\" for me, and it's a great, reliable spot just a couple of minutes away from the Eaton Centre, at a really decent price point!

I've had the golden curry, the green curry, the tom yum soup, a couple of the stir fries, and the Islamic noodles. If you're looking for a curry, go for the golden curry - nice and sweet with a great kick to it. The green curry can be a hit or miss, and can be a bit watery at times, but otherwise, it's decent. The Islamic noodles, as others have mentioned, is fantastic and has more flavour than you can describe. It might not look like much on your plate, but once you have it, the sauce and noodles together are a perfectly complicated combination of flavours that you can't stop eating. 

If you're looking for reliable, no-nonsense, reasonably priced Thai food, particularly if you're at the Yonge/Dundas area, this is a decent spot. It's also great for families and big groups. Note, however, that street parking is very, very limited."}
{"text":"As someone who was visiting Toronto for the first time, I had no idea this place existed.  And a place called Salad King that had nothing to do with salads?  Strange, but I'm curious.

This place packs you in like sardines.  My friend and I ended up getting seats in the middle of the long table so the people sitting on either side of us were literally 1 foot away.  Nevertheless, it was still a good experience.  

The food was relatively cheap, quick and delicious.  We had the spring rolls, satay chicken, golden curry with beef and phud Thai with chicken.  All the dishes were great, but the phud Thai was excellent.  I couldn't stop eating even though I was full!  A fun place to eat when you want something tasty and low key."}
{"text":"Came here on Wednesday night at around 8pm and it was packed. It was surprising because first of all it was a weekday, it was pass dinner time, and it's a restaurant upstairs on second floor. I always stumble upon their posters on the escalator at Dundas station but never thought to try it out because I thought this is some health food place due to its name, so I was equally surprised to find out Salad King is actually a Thai food restaurant. Their menu only featured about 3 salad items lol. 

The environment:
The seating arrangement is quite \"sad\", like you sit in cafeteria style and there's no separation between you and the other people, so the noise level is on the higher end. I was able to get a seat when I was there, but the restaurant was still super packed. 
The bathroom was a little strange as well, my friend was uncomfortable to use the mixed gender bathroom. Basically everybody enters the same door to use the bathroom, but they do have individual stalls, so you actually only share the hand washing sinks. I was ok with the arrangement but it is something unconventional to see.

The food:
The menu was the sheet of paper that they put on top of the table to avoid getting the surface dirty. The prices were pretty cheap, most of the dishes were under $10. A lot of the options were spicy though, but as someone who don't normally eat spicy food, I think the one chili-level dishes were manageable. 
I ordered the Chicken Phud Tai with no spiciness and it was ok. The noodle was salty and sour and I liked the chewy texture of the rice noodle. The portioned seemed huge but it was mainly noodle, not a lot of chicken and veggies. I only managed to eat half of what was there and packed the rest home. The smell was pretty pungent so I don't suggest anyone to bring it to work and reheat it.  
I got a taste of my friend's Chicken Coconut Milk Soup (one chili-level) and Mango Coconut Milk Sticky Rice (non-spicy). The soup had an interesting taste, you don't taste the spiciness until the liquid gets to your throat, and eventually you would feel that the soup was indeed pretty spicy. I liked the coconut milk on the sticky rice, but I wish the coconut milk was scrambled with the rice for even flavour, instead of just poured on top of the rice. The mango was fresh but not ripe enough.

The service:
You get an assigned waiter for your table, which I feel is a bad arrangement, because they are always busy and don't have the time to check up on you. We didn't get any benefit from having an assigned waiter, when in fact we literally had to get another waiter to look for our waiter. I wish they could have just done it like Chinese restaurant style, where you can ask any waiter who just so happened to walk by for service. The food was slow too, I think we waited about 15-20mins to get served. 

Verdict:
I personally wouldn't come back here, despite some of my friends claimed to come here at least once each week. Food wasn't outstanding, and I just can't stand the noisy environment and the slow service."}
{"text":"God bless Salad King.

Though the cafeteria-style seating isn't great, Salad King is certainly one of the more reliable (and affordable) Thai restaurants within the downtown core. I've never not enjoyed the heck out of their food.

On this particular visit, I decided to get an old favorite: Phud Thai (\"Rice noodles, carrots, peanuts, tofu, green onions, bean sprouts, coriander & egg in fish sauce & tamarind sauce\") I ordered it with shrimp and five chilis worth of spice, and we were off to the races.

It's a solid dish. The sauce is super flavorful, almost addictively so, while the accompanying veggies work really well. There's also a good level of spice here, and the shrimp is cooked perfectly. My only complaint is that it didn't quite make it to the table quickly enough, and the dish wasn't as hot as it could (or should) have been.

I should also note that we tried the Cucumber Salad (\"Cucumber, red peppers, lettuce, dried shrimp & peanuts with a traditional fish sauce, lime juice & green chili dressing\") and it, too, was delicious."}
{"text":"Fairly good food if you are seeking a vegetarian based option in the city.  The main problem are the tables you have to share with fellow strangers in the dining room creating a prison cafeteria atmosphere"}
{"text":"Salad King has been one of my favourite Toronto restaurants for 15+ years. I first discovered it while visiting a friend from Ryerson and she took me, telling me it was a Ryerson student gem. Cheap and delicious, it sure was!

The 'Siam Noodles' is my favourite dish. I'll never get sick of eating it. The taste is just one of a kind. I also like their 'Islamic Noodles' (secret menu), which is similar but with more stuff in it, like veggies. My friend loves the 'Thai Basil Noodles'. Their curry's (curries?) are good too, and I like the spring rolls. If I get spring rolls with my takeout order, they never make it home. Nom nom."}

it's not your best Thai, but the most decent one around the area. i'm pretty fond of it because of the consistancy of it all. i like the levels of pepper (heat/spiciness) that you can choose here. sometimes i'm feeling ultra spicaaaaay or mild. Siam Noodles, Evil Jungle Prince, their spring rolls and Chicken Panang are my favorites. stay away from the Pad Thai... not too spectacular."}
{"text":"- What I have tried:
    + Mango salad (1/5): it's basically slices of mango and tomatoes in some lime juice, totally different from mango salad I eat at home, there was no meat either lol. I rather go to supermarket to get fresh mangoes than eating this salad.
   + Thai Milk tea (2/5): completely different from all Thai milk tea I have tried (at Khao san, Pai, etc), the milk tea was so tasteless and I couldn't taste tea flavour.
   + Green curry (4/5): not as good as Khao san but pretty decent as compared to the price, it was a bit on a sweeter side, I really enjoyed it tho.
   + Panang curry (5/5): best one out of all three curries they offered. I got it with beef and it went extremely well.
   + Islamic noodles (4/5): It's the only dish in their \"secret menu\", It was good, but too creamy that I couldn't finish all. One tip is that you should add more lime juice to balance the creaminess. 
   + Phud Thai (4/5): not as sweet or creamy as Islamic noodles, but more on the salty kinda sour taste. It was good tho.
   + Thai Basil Noodles (5/5): Love this dish, very flavourful, I could finish the entire dish without  feeling sick. Highly recommend it.
   + Siam Noodles (4/5): tastes like Islamic noodles but more on the sweeet side, and much creamier. I thought it was ok tho.
- Portion: Generous amount of noodles, but not as much meat.
- Price: Cheap compared to other Thai restaurants I have been to. If you want an affordable Thai food then go to this place, you won't regret it.
- Place was big, but after lunch they closed the front area so there is usually a lineup for dinner."}
{"text":"The lady at the front who seated us was so rude, although our waiter made up for it. As for the food, it was pretty underwhelming and salty. The environment was very noisy and crowded. Not the best experience here."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment!! Food was not as I expected (portion-wise) and service was even worse!

My girlfriend used to praise this place when they were in their old location. This was my first time trying this place and man do they need an overhaul in their operations.

We each ordered an entree, and first off the portions were SMALL! We both left the restaurant still hungry. The taste of the food was okay, but if you're looking to fill up, you'll probably need to order another entree to share. 

Our worst experience however was the service and speed of the food. It was a Monday night and it was packed. I eat out at least 4-5 times a week so I understand that when it gets busy things can be a bit slow, but I've never experienced anything like this before. My entree was served to me about 20 mins after we ordered. My girlfriend's entree didn't come since they said that stir-fried noodles take a while longer. Since we were hungry and the food was getting cold I started eating. I finished my meal and STILL no entree for my girlfriend. 25 minutes of additional waiting we had enough and asked to cancel the order and get the bill since we had other plans. As the waitress was about to cancel the order, the food finally arrived. This was 30 mins AFTER I had finished my entree and almost an hour since we ordered! UNBELIEVABLE! And when we got the bill, they still had the nerve to charge us full price for everything! Even the couple next to us complained to the waitress about how long the food took. They waited 45 mins and no food. The waitress just pointed to my girlfriend saying that she was waiting a long time. What kind of excuse is that? Are we competing on who will wait for their food the longest? When we finished we just threw down our money and left. This place has gone from excellent on my girlfriend's list to absolutely horrid. We're never setting foot in this place again!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place four stars because of the food and the rather clever decor.   If, however, I put more weight on ambience it would get only three.  This is the kind of place to go to fill your stomach quickly with great food, but it is not conducive to a social dinner.

First, the food and prices:   Very good bargain (cheaper by a dollart or more than most Thai places for the same dishes).   Despite the fact that the menu uses little Thai terminology, the dishes seemed to be authentic, as well as being very taster.  My tom yum had little sugar and one could tast the fish base in the broth, both of which seemed very positive to me.   A dish of penang curry included peanuts like it should and was excellent.  Service was quiet but sufficiently excellent.  I also liked the witty sayings on the wall and cute lighting.

The drawback of this place is the noise level  and uncomforatble seating (backless benches).  The large number of patrons and lack of acoustic paneling or tiles made it impossible for me to join in conversation with the others I was having dinner with.

I think this is the kind of place that is good for students looking for a bargain dinner but not so good for older people like myself whose hearing has become less adequate over the years!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype. In the heart of Toronto, the King has risen.

The King generously provides some of the finest Thai dishes straight from Thailand heavens. He is the one past customers would drool over; newcomers would eat their hearts out for; and even leave other Thai restaurants begging for mercy. A legend in the making, the King brings great admiration but can still seek for pefection.

The King shows great empathy to commoners living in today's economy, offering affordably priced meals in a generous size.

The King encourages togetherness. My party of four was seated at a teenie tiny square table (sized for a party no more than 3, but perfect for 2). Our large menu sheets overlapped one another; footsies was unavoidable; purses tightly pressed against our bodies. Yet the King refused to offer us the neighbouring table... the empty table was waiting for a party of at least 6. Only until we asked again and again were we finally endowed a larger table.

The King seems oblivious that back pain is prevalent in today's society. If you do not merit recognition to be seated on the cushioned seats, most seats do not have a backing. Your back and posture will have to fend for itself.

I had the Panang Curry with Beef. The Panang curry was a flavourful perfect blend of spices and vegetables, with a liberal amount of beef, and rich coconut taste. The amount of curry was too much in comparison to the amount of rice given. But not to worry, the curry will not be wasted. It is so delicious you will clean that bowl dry.

There is no denying that Salad King is Royal. As long as Salad King is around, no stomach in this great land of ours will be a stranger to Thai food. 

Long live the Salad King."}
{"text":"Mmmmm as I consume my: Bangkok Stir Fry- Bean vermicelli, broccoli, bell peppers, green onions, egg, carrots, tofu, peanuts, bean sprouts, I am overwhelmed by emotions of joy.  A good Thai restaurant east of Spadina in the Downtown Core!  It's a bit of a hike up to Yonge & Dundas, but like I always say: walk there, subway back.  Initially had trouble finding the place as it's not actually on Yonge street but rather a side street. 

 However, once you locate the restaurant, the magic doesn't end there oh no, but rather at your desk as you consume the food.  Called 20 minutes ahead of time and it was waiting for me when I arrived.  Although I had to ask them for chopsticks while they had included Fork/Spoon in the bag already.  Is it wrong to feel offended when Oriental restaurants assume we can't handle chopsticks?  Argh... stupid westerners!  

Simply a massive portion - aka leftovers for dinner or lunch tomorrow.  $10 with tax.  I would go back definitely.  Although I recommend ordering ahead as it was very busy around lunchtime."}
{"text":"Ordered golden curry beef and it was so good! I can just consume all rice only with the curry. It was so tasty. I saw many people having noodles so I might Try it next time."}
{"text":"My reviews are usually long and thorough, but there's a lot to be said from the simplicity of my review of Salad King. The bottom line is, going to Salad King is a safe decision, regardless of what you order. The food is delicious, and there is a wide variety of options. Both the food and the drinks are very affordable. The waiters are efficient and the food comes out fast. Salad King has been serving the masses for awhile now, especially with the Ryerson clientele, and it is clear that they know what they are doing.

The only downside is the unique atmosphere that may or may not jive with your tastes. On one hand, the decor is all very new and modern looking, mainly due to the recent re-opening after the unfortunate accident at their previous location. On the other hand, a lot of the restaurant feels very much like a high school cafeteria, with a couple of long, metal tables with small hanging lights down the middle. It's not a big deal though, after being seated and eating I quickly stopped noticing.

In conclusion, Salad King has perfected the art of fast, delicious Thai food. Check it out, you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"You know despite the hype, Salad King is a good place for Thai but I think its popularity supersedes its food. 

My pad thai was good, but not amazing and not spicy. I asked for 3 chilis and honestly, it wasn't spicy enough. Despite my new found tolerance for spice, the portions are quite big which left me with a lot of leftovers. 

What makes SK great is how cheap the food is, which is why it's a favourite among Ryerson students and frugal eaters like myself. 

I ordered take out and it took about 15-20 minutes for my food to get ready. That's not bad considering how insane they are during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for the price. The golden curry is my absolute favourite and I like it spicy. The best part about this place is that they make it spicy according your desire. Good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times it has been a streamlined, friendly, and amazing experience... despite the communal tables. I don't know if it's how the place is designed but you don't really hear what neighbours are talking about unless you really eavesdrop, and the noise in the place doesn't overpower conversation so that's pretty cool.

The food is great, it's a really good quick in and out place. It's how fast food should be done, even though it's delicious and not really 'fast food'. I got the satay chicken skewers and orange chicken without rice, because I am a protein craving beast. What was really cool is if you say 'no rice' they take a dollar off the bill. So it's super neat that they award you for not wasting food and that they have that option on their bill till. It's a busy place so the staff is quick, friendly and don't really have time for chit chat, but it's cool that they have a smile on their face (and are cute :P)."}
{"text":"Ordered the pad thai, mild heat. 

I normally don't handle spicy well, but the flavours of the dish were great. It makes me ignore the spicy taste and just enjoy the flavour. I always order pad thai, and not even Spring Rolls or all the other pad thais I've ordered have been able to top theirs off. Because of this restaurant, I've been a bit more lenient on ordering spicy foods just hoping that the taste is worth a kick."}
{"text":"I've been going to Salad King for the last 2 years and I've never been disappointed with what I've gotten. The service is always great and the food is even better.
I like the fact that the food has always remained consistent throughout the years opposed to other places where it's very hit and miss. 
I recommend trying the Thai Basil noodles, it seems to be the most popular and the best. What you choose for the chilli level is up to you. As for me I usually get the 20 chilli level. 
If you're ever in the area definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"You got to try their SIAM noodles! This noodle dish was drenched with peanut and coconut milk sauce. I ordered mine with one chili spice level. The peanut sauce on top was sweet, savory and a hint of spice all at the same time and it also had bits of crushed peanuts. I never heard or seen this dish anywhere else in GTA before. So I was excited when I get to try this dish! 

I selected beef as my protein for the dish. They gave a generous amount of beef and the meat was very tender. The noodles were made al dente and everything goes well together when you bite into this noodle heaven! I like how they have vegetarian options for so many dishes. I feel bad for vegetarian diners because they don't have many selections to choose from but I feel this restaurant can compensate for this :). 

We came here for dinner and the service was pretty good. We were arranged to seat at the \"cafeteria\" area. There were endless rows of wooden benches and no division between the tables. It was pretty spacious but we wished we get to sit at the booths instead. It looked like the booths were reserved for larger party, next time we will bring more friends. The seats at the booths looked a lot more comfortable than our wooden benches :/. Other than the poor seating arrangement, the waitress was very courteous and she kept an eye on us during our meal. She also refilled our water without us asking! 

I would totally recommend this place if you like noodles!!! :D"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday when toronto is as cold as the north pole, lol. Th tom yum soup was good, just a little bit lack of some sour taste, maybe some more lemongrass and kaffir leaves can make it better. The fact that you can choose your own spicy level is lovely. I tried 1 pepper this time for my pud thai and is looking forward to 3 peppers next time. The portion was big, and the price was good. Good place for some friends to get together on casual occasion. It's usually a bit crowded though."}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype, its not very good. So many friends have recommended it to me and I was left disappointed. It was not worth it, and the line up for a table was nuts."}
{"text":"The new location has beautiful decor an the service is quick and friendly here and the prices here are fair.."}
{"text":"For me, whether a Thai restaurant is deemed good or not really depends on the Pad Thai..It 's one of the most basic Thai dishes and it gives you an idea of the culinary skills of the chef/cook.. I had a dish of chicken pad thai there today for lunch and it was soggy and pretty tasteless ..Even the Indian cook at Supermarket Lounge on Augusta Ave in the Kensington Market does a much better job at the dish. Not sure how the place can be so busy with diners ...probably lots with not so discerning tastes."}
{"text":"Been going here for the last few years when I'm craving Thai food downtown. My go-to has always been their off-menu item which is their Thai Islamic Noodles. It's a coconut milk Panang Curry with rice noodles and veggies and I always usually choose chicken as my protein. Those who have been are well aware of their spicy scale which is how much heat you want in your dish. I love my spice and have had it with 20 chilis before but of course that is not ideal. Apparently a regular has their dishes with 50 chilis which is insane, I think 1-3 chilis gives a nice little kick. 

You can't go wrong with their other dishes such as mango salad and Khao Soi, which is an egg noodle dish with chicken and veggies in a coconut curry soup. The perfect accompaniment is their delicious Thai iced tea. 

Just keep in mind that when dining in, you're seated at communal tables, but don't worry there is plenty of space and even a basket underneath the seats where you can put your bags and anything else that you may be carrying."}
{"text":"Been here several times now. Amusing decor but be prepared to sit beside other diners as the tables are school cafeteria style. There isn't a lot of room for coats or bags as there is only a small basket under the benches to put them in. 

Service is fast and attentive, especially making sure your water is always filled. Prices are reasonable. Food is pretty average but always tasty. You can pick your heat level but I personally don't find it spicy enough. I've had the 15 spice level and it wasn't enough for me so I will be sure to try 20 next time. 

All in all, a good spot for a quick tasty meal."}
{"text":"I was totally surprised when I walked in the restaurant! For those of you that don't know, the restaurant is upstairs! 
The food was great! Reasonable prize! The service was pretty quick! I'd go back again!"}
{"text":"Salad King is what I would consider to be cheap and cheerful Thai - if your idea of cheap and cheerful involves a noisy packed room of people waiting for tasty (if not authentic) food. 

Service is very quick and you're never waiting long for food. I would say the food is consistently good (although the spiciness varies, despite ordering the same number of 'chili peppers' each time I'm there). Favourites include the spring rolls, wonton soup, basil beef, phad thai, and green curry.

Yes, I understand that there are way more authentic Thai restaurants in the city. But if you're looking for a fairly inexpensive meal close to downtown where service is prompt and the food is pretty good, Salad King is a good choice."}
{"text":"If you are a solo traveler like me, get ready to feel embarrassed and awkward at this place. Especially if you go during dinner time when the place is crowded. That's what happened to me. This place doesn't have the standard sitting. Instead they have long benches with individual seats along both side. I sat next to a Korean couple who kept looking at me because I was eating alone. No type of privacy here. If you want the window seat, come non-rush hour. During rush-hour the window seats are save for party of 6 or more. On to the food. I got Chicken Pad Thai with level 5 spiciness for $10. It was okay. There weren't a lot of substances in the dish such as tofu or veggies. Just mostly noodles, chicken, crushed peanuts, and basil. They have spicy scale, which they add different levels of spiciness to your dish. I got a free spring roll using the minicard you find at hotels. One big plus is that the staff here are attentive."}
{"text":"Salad King is a good, solid, cheap eats sorta place to go when you are in the area.  Personally, I think this neighborhood is a bit lacking in decent eats that are affordable or especially good.  Salad King fits the bill nicely.  Really yummy vegetarian selection - and something for the carnivores too!  The only irritating thing about this place is the seating, it tends to be a little too cozy for me.  But, there are some seats that are a little more private, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Honestly, they have the worst customer services for a restaurant in the downtown core. First impression - We didn't realize the Plus size girl who was wearing street clothes was a hostess for the restaurant but whatever.  

The Restaurant is loud as F***! When we asked to be seated in a less noisy area. We couldn't even hear Hostess explain herself. But She said during dinner hours only 3 people or more is allowed to sit in the quiet area. It was a Wednesday night after 7 PM, and The Restaurant was less than half full?! We told her if we can't sit in a quiet area then we'll leave. 

Her response was \"That is Fine\".  

Well, we went to Basil Box across the street! The hell with your Off The Street Hostess, your school cafeteria tables, and chairs! 

McDonald's have better Customer Service and decor than you guys, and they serve FAST FOOD!"}
{"text":"Food quality was not consistent. Service was ok. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Sure this place is probably one of the loudest restaurants you will ever eat at in your life but if you can fit that into the experience it's a great time!  

What blows me away is that many of the items on the menu are sub $9 and he portions are huge!  We had some Asian girls who sat next to us who ordered one dish each and by the time they were finished they were putting 7/8 of it in a box to take home.  They must have thought my brother and I are hungry pigs with the 3 dishes that we finished!  We ordered Panang Curry Beef, Basil Chicken and Bankok Stif Fry Shrimp.  

Quality and taste has been the same since day one and I've been eating here since the before the fire at the old location!  

No wonder this place is cram full of University students and others enjoying a great Thai meal!  

Rock on Salad King!  You so good!"}
{"text":"This place is the definition of university eats; it's cheap, huge portions and quick. 

I had the Islam noodles (after reading all the reviews that claimed it was the best thing from their \"secret menu\"), I got it done with five chilies, and I couldn't even taste the spice, but it was still tasty, like yellow curry noodles. My friends got the chicken fried rice, good with pieces of fried chicken that came with it, and the basil noodles, which were more plain, and I would definitely recommend the Islam noodles if you were going to do noodles. 

Service was decent and food came fresh. I will definitely be coming back for more cheap eats. This place gets really busy quickly, but turnover is good."}
{"text":"I have been to salad king several times, and it has always been  a great experience. I dont think they take reservations and they only seat a group once everyone is there, but i have never had to wait longer than 20 minutes.
    The service is really quick, even with the crowds they have.  The seating is almost like a cafeteria, but i never mind because the food more than makes up for it. 
  I usually order a noodle dish with 5 or 10 chillies depending on how adventurous i feel. The portions of the noodle dishes are generally huge so bring your appetite. Although the food is so good you might not want to leave any on the plate. Another thing here is that I have food allergies, but they have never ever missed the special instructions on any item.
definitely recommended if you are in the area."}
{"text":"their panang chicken curry w/ 3 chilis... DAMN."}
{"text":"I think it has changed, though it has been yrs since I've been here. Food was oily (seafood fried rice), soup (Thai noodle soup) very peppery despite labeled 'not spicy' so my kid wasn't able to eat it. Feels like it's rushed Thai food now, and not the same quality put into their best signature dishes that made them well-known. I'm sad. But I do still enjoy their Panang curry at least."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Salad King is a popular establishment for Ryerson students who want Thai food without venturing too far from campus. No matter which day you go, that place is guaranteed to be busy for lunch, dinner, etc. It's located up one floor, but there's an elevator for those who need to use it.

I came here without much expectations, as I've tried places like Pai, Khao San Road, and Sukho Thai and know what excellent Thai food is. I expected large portions, but food quality to be barely above fast food.

I ordered the siam noodles with chicken, as I was intrigued by the peanuts and coconut milk sauce. The food took a little while to come, but needless to say from my photo the portions were gigantic. I was actually very surprised that I was able to finish the whole thing; good thing I was starving during the morning! As for the quality...meh. The sauce wasn't bad, but the noodles definitely felt extremely low quality. For $10.50 I expected a little more from the quality side, and I'm willing to have a smaller plate for an increase in food quality.

It was an experience for the most part just to see what the hype was about, but despite the excellent timely service I received, I don't think I'll return as there are other Thai places nearby which I've enjoyed their food and have reasonable prices (such as Thai on Yonge)."}
{"text":"Just go. You'll enjoy anything spicy is nicey."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 -4 times. Service is decent, from what I remember. Atmosphere is spacious, white and pretty. The food is alright, although their pad thai tasted like they used some packaged sauce you get off the grocery store.  Convenient location across the Eaton Centre. It's usually busy."}
{"text":"Came here with my best friend yesterday and we ordered the spicy squid, Thai iced tea and Thai milkshake. (I forgot to ask what my friend ordered, whoops!) At first I thought the spicy squid wouldn't have much flavour because it was still so white, but oh was I wrong.  That dish had so much flavour and spice I had to order the Thai iced tea! It was super yummy! I loved how the Thai iced tea was orange in color and it had a bitter taste it to, unlike many other iced teas. We chowed down so fast I didn't get to take any pictures. Overall a great experience and will be coming back whenever I'm downtown."}
{"text":"I would call this the ideal Thai fast food restaurant.
The Islamic noodles from the secret menu is my favourite dish and a must try!!!"}
{"text":"There's nothing wrong with 3-stars, I do indeed believe this to be A-OK.  It is inexpensive, fast, has a lively atmosphere, and the food is good.  I believe all meals are under $10, including steamed rice.

They have a heat-scale of mild or medium, then 1, 3, 5, 10, or 20 chilies.  I only ordered my dish as \"3 chilies\" one time and found it to be quite hot.  I believe there might be some inconsistencies with the heat-scale, since some other reviewers have said that their 3 chili dish was not hot, but maybe it was just me."}
{"text":"Great Thai food and cheap. It's consistently busy also so if you are going with a large group of people go on the off peak times."}
{"text":"When I first came here many years ago, I thought, \"Finally, a great Thai restaurant in Toronto!\" That was before a whole wave of trendy Thai restaurants started opening downtown.

Salad King's food tastes very salty and somewhat greasy. I'm constantly thirsty when I eat here, so a part of me suspects that there is MSG in the food. I used to order the Hot Thai noodles each time, but that hasn't been consistent in the last few years.

I don't really enjoy the cafeteria-style seating, particularly because it's stainless steal. The place is always crowded with students and the food just isn't worth the wait.

I think it's a very good place for university students to go to, but since I'm not in that stage of my life anymore, I think I'd go elsewhere for a better meal."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here. I usually get take out from here because it is quick and the portions are large for the pad thai. It's not the best pad thai in the city but it is still good. The spicy chicken is also a good option. 

I usually have good experiences here however last time I tried to order take out here, no one answered the phone. After calling back again I was put on hold for a few minutes and they hung up on me. Knocking off a star  because of this."}
{"text":"I go to Salad King a lot, because of its close proximity to my school. The place is always packed and fairly busy consistently through out the day. The food is definetely good but doesn't warrant a 4 star in my books. I love the chilli system, which allows the patrons to choose how spicy they want their food. It can often turn into a battle between friends of who can handle more chillis. I think next time I want to try ten! One of my favourite dishes is the Golden curry, it is rich, creamy, slightly sweet and full of flavour. The mango salad is ok and so is the papaya salad because I have had better. The pad thai is good but not the best. Last time I tried the thai tea with milk and sugar after my meal, and it tasted interesting in a good way. It was definetly a type of team I had never had before. The seating situation is quiet tight so I will recommend going here before you go shopping . I am not sure if I will get in trouble for saying this, but they apparently have a secret menu, which are dishes not on the menu. My friend last time ordred the Islamic noodles with is curry noodles, a part of the secret menu."}
{"text":"I wanted to give one star because of the horrible customer service I had at Salad King during my last experience, however, I've been here plenty of times before and most times it's been decent enough.  The food is alright and price is economical.  

I've had the pad thai many many times before, and  I always ask for it to be \"extra saucy\" because I don't like it when it's very dry.  However, I went there with 2 of my friends and when the waiter was taking our order, i asked for my usual, pad thai with extra sauce.  He stared at me blankly with a confused expression on his face.  I told him that I always ask for it to be extra saucy and so the chef should know what that means, he nodded and brought the order in.   It didn't take long for our food to come out, and of course my pad thai was dry, without the extra sauce.  Thinking, okay, that's fine, they might have forgot, I'd eat it anyway.  However when i took my first bite, it was SO SOUR!!!! It tasted like someone poured an ENTIRE bottle of vinegar into the noodles.  I could not eat it!! So I called the waiter over, explained that the noodles were sour and that i could not eat it.  He took the noodles back in, only to bring the SAME dish back out saying that I had asked for extra sauce.  I proceeded to explain to him that yes, I did say that but there was no extra sauce and that it was SOUR and not edible.  I asked to speak to a manager because he didn't seem to understand what I was saying.  When the manager came over, he ARGUED with me that I had asked for extra sauce, he then POINTED at the menu and told me that it specified that pad thai has \"tamarind sauce\" in the noodles, so that's what they added.  I explained to him that no, i wanted it to be extra saucy, that I wanted it to be wet! He argued/ yelled at me and told me that I asked for extra sauce, and was not specific enough and that it was my fault!  Frustrated, I told him to forget the extra sauce ad asked if he could bring me out a new dish, without any extra anything.  He then said , ok so would you like me to add that to the bill?  I looked at him and said, NO, i would like you to replace this one.  He refused and said \"what am I going to do with these noodles?  I can't waste them!\"   At that point, I was FURIOUS, how can a manger be like this to a customer?  and seriously, how much are noodles that you can't make a customer happy and just replace them?  Finally, I didn't want to argue anymore because we were on a schedule (we had tickets to a game), and told him to just leave it.  He actually left it and did NOTHING to make up for it.  Needless to say, I did not touch the dish.  Luckily, both my friends were willing to share what they ordered.  Throughout the rest of the meal, we got dirty looks from ALL the wait staff and when we asked for the bill, it took them forever to bring it out and the waiter just threw it on the table.  After the experience we had, we all agreed that we were not giving them any tips.  We paid them exact change with NO extra, none of the staff deserved anything.  Horrible horrible experience and I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Had business downtown and stopped in for lunch (my second time here). This place caters to city workers who are regulars and they had me seated immediately and my server Rain immediately greeted me with water and asking If I knew what I wanted..Nope, because I'm not a regular but I decided in a few mins to go with the Thai Basil noodles with just veggies. he was right back to take my order and my food came in about 5 mins. delicious noodles and sauce, could be a few more veggies considering this was veg-only no chicken and should be more than 50cents cheaper to get veg-only. still, great value, great experience, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Try the Thai Islamic noodles, they're delicious."}
{"text":"Salad king to me is like a machu wok but better and more variety from thai, viet and chinese...it's relatively cheap like under $10 for a meal so don't expect quality food as you would find in an authentic thai place like thai basil

I don't really like the cafeteria style seating but they do have individual tables
Good place for a quick bite and it's quite loud inside, reminds me of dim sum places"}
{"text":"We went on with this on like total gamble, but came out with total satisfaction! They served some amazing food.  Had the best noodles in life! Also very quick service. Very affordable Loved it. Again for sure!"}
{"text":"food has always been good in salad king since the previous location they had. I wasn't reviewing back then.

the good : 

food is always great, hot, and can be tailored on how you want them (spice level) (i bet they will make your water spicy if you want them to)

the bad :

some people cannot wait for 10 minutes if its really busy. but you have to understand that the reason why this place is packed.

advice :

while i was eating today. i kept on seeing food delivery guys so i guess either foodora and uber eats delivers around"}
{"text":"I visited this place back several years ago.  LOVE this place.  Will definitely visit this place again when I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"Food was so good. Also really spicy. I'm Sri Lankan and used to really spicy food and level 10 wasn't too bad, but it goes up to 20 so definitely be caution. I think for the normal person 10 would be a little too much. Panang was amazing but wish I had tried the secret menu item, Islamic noodles"}
{"text":"Three words, one dish Thai Islamic Noodles!!!! SO LOVE them. All of their items are great. Be prepared to have a good time and know that it gets noisy."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 7 this weekend. The decorations are beautiful and mixes modern art and Thai culture together very well. They were very busy though, and we waited about 20 min to be seated. 

The service was pretty good, they have a lot of waiters since they have a lot of tables. It gets pretty loud because of that though, so I can't really hear clearly sometimes. 

Food: between me and the rest of my group, it was good quality and the portions were pretty reasonable for the price. They have their menu on their website, but a meal ranges 7-10 dollars, more if you do dessert and appetizers of course.

Their Golden curry is delicious, and their Pad Thai is very legitimate. They even have spice levels for those who love spice. 

Overall I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Saturday, and was sadly disappointed by the service and quality of food. This is the second time I've eaten here, and I think it may be my last. On a busy saturday, you wouldn't think so much of the staff would be standing around doing nothing when we were ready to order. It was pretty hard to call someone over to take our order. When the food arrived it was room temperature and below average in taste. We spoke to the manager, to let her know and she very understanding and gave us a discount right away without hesitation."}
{"text":"A humorously named Thai restaurant, located near Dundas and Yonge. 

I came here as a party of two around 8 o clock and were seated in a large open concept restaurant environment. It resembles a beer hall and you will sit fairly closely with other people, so if you do not enjoy that, you may want to give Salad King a pass.

What this does however, is amplify your senses with the roar of conversation happening around you. This place is alive. This place is happening. It just is. 

I ordered the Khao Soi, and my friend ordered the Thai Islamic Noodles with shrimp (off menu according to fellow yelpers! I'm late to the party and am not a native of Toronto so don't hurt attack me if this is a well known fact). Additionally, you can order with a custom spicy level by the number of \"Chillies\". We ordered our dishes with 4 chillies. 

The food came with a generous portion and within 10-15 minutes. While 3 chillies was too mild for my taste, the food was extremely flavourful. The Thai Islamic noodles were a nice blend of sweet and savoury, more so on the savoury side. The dish is composed of rice noodles soaked in a tasty coconut curry.  

The Khao Soi was a coconut soup with egg noodles, cruchy breading and chicken breast. Equally tasty to the Thai Islamic Noodles.

Highly recommended to visit this place for some good food."}
{"text":"SIAM NOODLES FOR THE WIN!!! A friend ordered it and I went for the Shrimp Golden Curry which is also delish!! But the Siam Noodles are just wow! Friendly service, it can get really busy, we've lucked out each time :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch with colleagues. I've been here a couple of times before and always had a good experience. This time was no exception. I had heard from another yelp elite friend about some dish off the menu called Islamic noodles and decided to try it. And I have to say that it was absolutely delicious! It's basically noodles with vegetables and your  choice of protein tossed in a nicely seasoned creamy curry sauce. Sooo good!! This is a dish I will definitely order again. 
On the bad side, the water quality here is really really bad. I normally just have tap water with my food but the water here tastes chlorine! It's like drinking diluted bleach. I don't know why the water tastes so bad here because everywhere else in Toronto the water quality is good. I think Salad King should look into this because it really brings down the food experience. 
Because of the poor water quality I rate them 3 stars, although food alone would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and hands down my favourite dish is the Thai Islamic noodles. It's just so good! I've also had Pad Thai here as well as some of their curry dishes (that comes with rice). Everything they make here is delicious so you really can't go wrong.

I haven't been here in months but if not much has changed, their prices are very decent and their portions are a good size. I'm sure the seating is still uncomfortable but since I'm guaranteed a delicious meal, I don't mind the seating at all.

Quick note: there's storage space under the seats!

Make sure you check out this restaurant but if you want to avoid lineups, go slightly before/after the lunch/dinner rush."}
{"text":"I have gone here a couple of times and generally found the food to be delicious. Although, one time there was a hair in my food and I was told that my meal would be free, I had ordered a different dish instead when I sent my food back (same priced item) but I was told at the end that my meal would no longer be free because I didn't order the same item. I call that poor customer service."}
{"text":"Came here as a party of two, 8pm on a busy Saturday night. We were greeted right away and seated within 5 minutes even though this place was almost full and there were other people waiting. 

Despite being very busy, our server was attentive and accommodating-  almost 10 minutes after we ordered I realized that I had ordered to wrong item. I asked our server about it and he changed it for me with no problems (he was very nice about it too, didn't make me feel bad about it)

Now for the food:
- Siam noodles with beef: a little too sweet but delicious and satisfying 3.5/5
- green mango salad: a bit more sour than we liked but very generous portion 3/5
- seafood combination: nice amount of heat, plenty of squid and shrimp 4/5
- Sapporo on tap was more bitter than usual, a little concerned about when the lines were last cleaned.

Love the location and the atmosphere is so high energy, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I crave the islamic noodles pretty all the time now.  It's hard for me to order anything else on the menu!  The other chicken dish was mediocre.  The service is fast and friendly here.  I see myself coming back often for those noodles!"}
{"text":"This place is so busy all the time! I came here for lunch since our group had a reso for a group lunch. Everyone loves their green curry. I went with their cashew chicken with white rice shrug was just okay. Nothing special. 

Honestly this isn't my go to Thai place. I prefer Khao San Rd but for a quick Thai craving I'll stop in here. I find their prices are higher than it used to be when I used to attend Ryerson. Some lunches the service is bad. They barely notice you. Had to flag them down. Their portions are pretty big as well so I guess that justifies the price?"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat downtown... Or maybe even one of my favourite places to eat in all of the GTA.

I get the Islamic noodles everytime!! I tried maybe two other dishes but I can't imagine anything else beating this one, it's just so good!!!

The soft rice noodles arent sticky. The portions are huge and the price is great. The curry is so rich, fragrant, and flavourful. I love the balance of fresh veggies too. The meat is even in good portion too. I like the shrimps. They're quite large and generous in number too. I think these noodles are something everyone in Toronto should try at least once. Great comfort food. Great for takeout if you don't like sitting on a stool or sitting in loud restaurants."}
{"text":"Not every review needs to be an academic essay.

This is place is fast, cheap, and filling. The food isn't too shabby but it won't knock your socks off.  My three friends and I left full and without complains (thats right complains).

Best part of the meal was the customization of spicy level (not unique to this restaurant)"}
{"text":"I miss the old Salad King building from my Ryerson University days. I would go here for decent food for a reasonable price. But, since that building burned down and the location moved, it just doesn't have the same feel to it. Oh well."}
{"text":"Wasn't what I would call a very good dining experience, to be honest.....I love spicy thai food and this was posed to be the place to get it hot, I was excited since one of my long standing complaints about thai restaurants and their unwillingness to serve me \"thai hot\", or fire hot food, which is well documented in my thai restaurant reviews.......the mango salad here was not great tho I will say the mangos were just right in texture and taste, otherwise it was just on top of some chopped iceburg lettuce with lime juice squirted on it..... way too tart, and  I ordered a vegetarian stir fry at a spice level of 15 out of 20, cause I can never find \"thai hot\" served...the server was hesitant, thinking I should start at about 7, then told me there was chili paste on the table if I wanted to spice things up...um......chili paste is not spicy compared to what thai hot should be...so finally when I explained him I didn't find sambal oelick to be hot at all, he begrudgingly took my spice level of 15 and placed the order........when the dish came out, it was veggies sauteed in a ton of sambal oelick!!!!!  No fresh chilies or anything resembling spicy anywhere...but good thing I remembered the server had told me that I had that jar of chili paste on the table to spice things up just in case there wasn't enough in the dish already.

With all the accolades posted in the window, I was excited to try this restaurant but maybe my expectations were a little too lofty, cause they certainly weren't met on this visit....I would be willing to go back to see if 20 is spicy at all and maybe try a curry, but as being I only have 4 more days here, not sure if that will happen"}
{"text":"Food here is reasonable taste/quality for the price, but that doesn't mean it's good food. Pretty meh on all fronts."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch if you are in the Yonge and Dundas area. Service is quite face and the waiters are friendly. 

I got the Islamic noodles.  They are great with the curry.  Get 1 spicy because it gives a good kick without  it being too spicy. The curry is really creamy and full of flavour.  The portions are big so look to share.  

Cheap for the amount of food you get.  I would definitely try this out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Okie so now I've been here a few times... I wasn't so nice in my last review saying they have lost their touch.
I take that back.   I really enjoy their golden chicken curry. 
So hands down - GREAT food.

However I'm getting pissed at their seating arrrangements. 
Went here yesterday and couldn't even hear a thing the person sitting across from me was saying.  I couldn't hear MYSELF think.
Everyone is shouting over one another and this place gives me a headache with their noice.  

I wish they would fix this situation and not have everyone sit next to one another on benches.   VERY annoying.

Maybe next time I'll ask to sit in the back where the better tables are :/"}
{"text":"A true staple in Toronto. Always a good time here. Always reliable."}
{"text":"It's very spicy, if you want to eat some thing hot you should go give it a try. Other than that nothing really special, a descent Thai fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I went there with my cousins. The service was quick. The food was amazing. And the pricing was right on the mark. Going back for sure."}
{"text":"Came In dinner time on a Sat. Got a table immediately, the service was fast, and friendly the only thing I could suggest to improve the guest service is, have the hostesses wear a uniform. We had no idea who to see to sit down. 

I ordered the kha soi, this dish is delicious. It's smooth, sweet and fragrant. Very large portion, it has a lot of textures that work well together such as the crunchy egg noodles (chewy when soaked in the soup), noodles were good as well and large amount of chicken breast."}
{"text":"After having been recommend this place time and time again by several friends in the city, whenever I was looking for some good Thai food, I finally found this little spot situated above Footlocker on Yonge street. From street level I always find this place easy to miss, particularly when you`re standing on the west side of Yonge, but what I find kinda cool about this place is that you get a clear view of the restaurant and its diners if you`re standing on the east side of Yonge. 

Enough about location, onto the food...

The food is alright, especially for the price. There are lots of options, with a variety of levels of spice, which is nice! They offer a good selection of appetizers and soups. I have now been here on two occasions, and each time I ordered the same main dish (the Kari Noodles) and I have come away happy each time. As for their appetizers and soups. I have tried the spring rolls, but they do not measure up to the big and hearty spring rolls I`ve come to enjoy at other Thai locations. The soup here is okay. I`ve tried both the hot and sour soup and the wonton soup, and if I were to go back again I would definitely order the wonton over the hot and sour mushroom soup, because the hot and sour soup tasted too much of coriander, and the mushrooms were not very appealing. The wonton soup had a nice light flavour that satisfied my palate. 

While this is certainly not the best Thai food I have had in the city, I will be back. I don`t think this place is all it`s cracked up to be, and I would not wait in the long lineups I`ve seen at this place, but if the wait is short and I`m feeling like a quick cheap meal, then this place is A-Ok!"}
{"text":"By far the best Thai place in the city. I try to go every time I'm downtown. Prices are very reasonable and portions are usually big enough for two meals...unless you go really hungry and eat it all."}
{"text":"My friend and I both ordered the Siam Noodles based on the waitresses' recommendation. I had the veggie version while she got hers with chicken. We were extremely happy with out choice. The sauce was a peanut and coconut milk combination straight from heaven. The dish was the perfect amount of spicy. My friend wasn't too excited by the chicken but the sauce was too yummy to complain about. We topped the meal of with the mango and sticky rice which was absolutely divine. 

However, the evening took a turn for the crappy when they started cleaning up the restaurant and putting chairs up on tables around as as we were still eating out meal. We weren't notified that the restaurant was closed and the staff was quite rude about the whole thing. 

I would still go back as the food was great but I wouldn't go there to have a nice long meal. Maybe even do takeout to avoid the rude staff."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. Best Thai restaurant in Toronto hands down. All items are under or around $10, and the quantity is huge (enough for 2 full meals). And the food is simply delicious. Only complaint would be in inconsistency of the chili scale--it's always different every time I order. But the food is so delicious and flavourful that it doesn't matter. My favourite items are the curry dishes (golden is my fave), and the Islamic noodles (no longer mentioned on the menu but you could still order it). I ordered the basil chicken and it wasn't as flavourful as the others, but still good. Def recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"don't really get its popularity. might as well head to the food court! typical fast food taste, nothing special, seating is cafeteria style, shared tables. meal was not bad, but not great. pricing though was good and cheap, 

thai iced tea. wow, taste straight out of a can or juicebox. definitely nothing awesome except it's price. got 0.75 discount for some reason.

liked the atmosphere though, really quite busy! full house, zero wait. menu somewhat extensive, allowing for a range of spice level.

all in all, would not return unless i was drunk hungry"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype about this restaurant is. The service and food is average at most, but the most disappointing thing about Salad King is that their food is not \"Thai\" at all. The curry barely tastes any spices in it, and this is not McD trying to sell Thai Curry where they try to American-ize it. There are so many amazing Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto, I will not come back again."}
{"text":"Great place to eat good thai for a good price! 
Beware of the chillies... and be prepared for tight seating :) It's part of the salad king experience, though!"}
{"text":"for good measure, yeah, it's CURRY perfection. i could drink it all day long if it weren't spiced. my green curry veggies were obviously fresh, maintaining their integrity even whilst swimming in coconut milk. the yellow curry is even richer and galang-ier. 

i am trying to figure out exactly what made it better than any other thai restaurant i've been to-- i think it's the coconut milk/fish sauce/galang/basil balance. Not too sweet, not too salty. 

on the ratings scale, our server was sceptical i could handle a 10/20 for spiciness, but i insisted. turns out it wasn't really that spicy. next time i will go for a 15/20. 

and i will avoid the lunch hour rush. we waited about 30 mins for our food, and i agree with other reviewers that the bench wasn't comfortable. and our elbow-to-elbow neighbors kept eavesdropping even with the din throughout."}
{"text":"Slightly better than thai express for pad thai. The other dishes (curries and stir fry) are quite tasty though. 
Come here a fair amount because it's at such a convenient location."}
{"text":"A standard for Ryerson students and Alumni.

Can't wait for them to re-open. I usually get the Vegetarian Phud Thai.

Best deal for $8.00. Decent servings with an abundance of noodles and vegetables.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Its not \"authentic\" thai, but the food is great here. Its more of a canteen/sit-down fast food than a restaurant. The place is very clean, busy and loud, but its great. Its busy, but you can usually get a seat pretty quickly. 

My favorite dish is the islamic noodles which isn't on the menu, but the wait staff will know what you're talking about. Portions are big, so you can definitely share."}
{"text":"Chicken Siam Noodle, 5 chilli's!!
I like the new location, much better than the old one (before it burnt down, or the building collapsed, whatever it was)
Tom Yum soup here too is dynamite.
It is fast, and the servings are big. You can get at least dinner, then next day lunch out of it."}
{"text":"The \"rainbow chicken\" was disgusting, bland and was watery. The dish was like a game of \"Where's Waldo?\" except you're trying to find chicken among soggy, tasteless vegetables. 
The \"mango chicken\" tasted funny and was watery. It looked identical to the rainbow chicken except the sauce had been swapped out for an orange one. 
Yes, the food is somewhat moderately priced, but 9 bucks for some watery crap? No thanks. There are so many better Thai places in Toronto.
The noise level is crazy in here and the fact you're sitting in such close proximity to (possibly questionable) diners makes me cringe. On this night, my dining companion and I were seated squished against a wall next to a couple on their date. But the story doesn't end there, at one point, they began hand-feeding each other dessert and I tried really hard not to vomit. The man also had a fixation with my phone because I caught him staring at the screen multiple times whenever I was using it. Service was non-existent and we left half our food on the plate, got the bill and rushed out of there feeling somewhat violated. Such an overrated restaurant. 

McDonalds or SK? McD's.
Starve or SK? Starve. 

1 star for this place? Oh sorry there's no zero star option. 

I love Thai food but this King should be stripped of his title."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the Islamic noodles that people have been raving about especially with the pictures of noodles swimming in coconut creamy goodness. 
Unfortunately my take out order had enough sauce for less than half the noodles in the container and that was with rationing!!!(booooo) The sauce was tasty but barely enough to coat and taste half the container! 
When I went back was told extra sauce costs $2. However, if I asked to have noodles 'in sauce' (as per the original dish in house per pictures) then I could have enjoyed my healing pile of bland dried up noodles drowning in that delicious creamy sauce. 
In the end, they did nothing but say next time. My suggestion was that the (2) options for take away be given at the time of ordering you (noodles in sauce or pay for extra sauce at time of order) so that any new potential returning patrons can enjoy the dish the way it was suppose to be served. Unless you like piles of dried up noodles.
I think I might have enjoyed this dish if there was plenty sauce"}
{"text":"I used to go to the old Salad King back in the day. It was a little grimy and dark, but this new one has cleaned up. You can definitely see that they put a lot of money and care into their cleanliness and decor. It's still busy. The food is still overrated. The price is average. I don't really recommend any dish in particular, but I give Salad King more than 3 stars because I can see how clean it is. For that, I give them a bonus."}
{"text":"My friend Anastasia (see photo) introduced to me this place before an event we were both attending. I had never been there before and I was not a big fan of salads or noodles, although I have had Thai food numerous times.

I ended up having beef and rice, Ana had somekind of noodles (I don't recall the details), and she also had a smoothie - which I got a small sip of, and it was AMAZING. I have made a mental note to go back there sometime, take my wife, and make sure to order the smoothie.

So yes, with just one taste I fell in love with their smoothies. (The beef and rice was also good.)

I was not fussy about our seating. I would have preferred a booth, but the place was very busy and I didn't get much of a choice. The service however was excellent and there was a spot where Ana could charge her cellphone, so that was a bonus.

:)"}
{"text":"We went to the Salad King Restaurant for dinner. I been to the Salad Kind years ago at their old location but not at their new location. My co-workers love coming here and I heard rave reviews.

We went upstairs to a high school cafeteria room with communal tables where you have to sit next to people. The annoyed hostess told us to sit next two other people even though there were empty tables available. We eventually got a empty table. But we were told we will have to share our table with other people.

We ordered the mango salad and spring rolls. I order the chicken pad thai while my friend ordered shrimp pad thai. The mango salad quickly arrived with three minutes. Our pad thai arrived before we finished our appetizers. Other people came and I stuffed my coat underneath my chair. The restaurant is very noisy and difficult to carry on a conversation. I guess most of the other diners were students from Ryerson University so they were used to the environment.

The food was okay. I have better pad thai at other restaurants. The spring rolls were good while the mango salad was just shred mango.

Would we go back? Never. The assembly line dining experience was terrible. Everything was designed to maximum profit."}
{"text":"one of the best thai food places i have had in my life. try the panang for sure! and the ice cream :)"}
{"text":"If you want cheap Thai food this is the place to go! This place is always packed and there's always a line. But the wait isn't too long. People come and go really quick. 
If you don't have much time it's a good place for take out too.  

Came here a couple of times already and decided to write a review. Most of the time I ordered the curry. The curry here is delicious but the rice that comes with it isn't too good.  Portions for the curry is a little small. Needs more rice. 

The fried rice dishes here are also pretty good. 

The tom yum soup here is cheap but is lacking flavour. It really sour and spicy. Wouldn't recommend it. 

I've also ordered the Thai street noodles. The portions are huge. There's a lot of rice noodles. But the broth lacked flavour even though it's cooked with shrimp and chicken. It was just too sour. It's so sour that the noodles taste sour. It's not salty enough. The only thing you can taste is sour and spicy. Really would not recommend. They need to make major improvements to the recipe of this. 

Additionally, there's a problem. The water here is tap water like most places but it has a really weird odour. You should ordered a drink instead..... 

The Thai ice tea is good. 

Overall, good for the curries !"}
{"text":"It's an institution! Like many, I have frequented this place since it was on the east side of Younge, and they hung the Thai King's picture near the entrance way. And 15 years later, it has transformed into a hip restaurant. But the affordable pricing remains!

I had the golden curry with chicken ($9) and spring rolls ($4.5). Yummy! I cleaned the plate.

Service was quick, food comes out in minutes. Staff is friendly, and the manager delivers the dishes to make sure of customer satisfaction. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"My last visit was circa 2007: I was a broke student on a budget but still appreciated good food, which is why I always frequented Salad King. 

Fast forward 6 years later: a new shiny location but still the same delicious food. If you are looking for a quick, authentic meal with a buzzing atmosphere, stop in here and try the Pad Thai and Green Chicken Curry. 

Dinner for 2 including an appetizer is easily under $30. Considering the area and dinner options, Salad King is a top choice for authentic, cheap food - unless you like paying $20 for a plate of generic Fish & Chips - then there's lots to check out that are 2 star worthy around these parts."}
{"text":"YUM! love it!! when I need a hit of thai food, this is where I go and I'm satisfied until I get my next craving (helps that I tend to over eat just because the portions are so big!)  Staff are friendly enough, service was fast (considering food is made to order), and if you're looking for mainstream thai food that's still loaded with flavour and spice, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why it's so busy because the food is only ok. My friends keep telling me that it's way better than Spring Rolls but I don't feel the same...and there's usually less of a line up ay Spring Rolls.

The waiting staff is good (friendly and fast) but the hostess is always really grumpy (cheer up!)."}
{"text":"Coming to this place is all about expectations. Since the name doesn't really tell you anything about what the place is actually like, I went in not knowing what to expect but came out a fan.

I ordered the penang curry and my girlfriend ordered the fried rice. Both dishes came pretty fast and the service was good for the fast-foody environment. 

Each dish is surprisingly large for the price and comes prepared well. I really liked the fried rice that my girlfriend got and it was comparable to the likes of Khao San Road. The penang curry I got was average however, and felt slightly too watery. I would definitely rate the curry dishes lower than Khao San Road and Pai Northern Thai - but hey, its probably about $5-$7 cheaper here so its still worth it. 

Overall:
-Good service and surprisingly cheap prices
-Would recommend getting the fried rice dishes over the curry dishes
-Noisy and busy atmosphere"}
{"text":"Delicious food every time! I'm obsessed with the Islamic noodles. It's a combination of panang curry and hot Thai noodles. I can't seem to want to order anything else but this. I do have to say that sometimes the meat is lacking but so far the taste is always the same."}
{"text":"One of the best value restaurant in Toronto.

Their price is right and the taste is pretty good.

I am a big fan of their 'Hot Thai Noodles' and the 'Islamic Noodles' (the second one is not on the menu but if you order it they'll get it for you. It's basically hot thai noodles smothered in coconut milk sauce!!!)

Their curry dishes are pretty good as well, green curry and red curry are among my favorites.

I have hard time choosing between a curry dish and a noodle dish every time I go.

The seating could be a bit crowding, but it's a busy place, at least the service is quick and nice. The waitors/waitress are always smiling, quick to respond to requests.

I am a fan, and they get 4 stars from me. (wish i could rate them 4.5)"}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant that resonates with many Torontonians and is in an awesome location. Personal favourites are the Thai basil noodles, spicy chicken, and Thai fried rice. I love how there's a full scale of spiciness so you can tune the dish how you like, great lively atomsphore, and prices are more than fair for what you're getting. Not much to complain about other than seating arrangement, I prefer full separate tables as opposed to the kind of \"bench\" alignment here but it's not a big deal."}

they have fantastic green curry, and their pad thai is great!

one of the better quick eats in downtown toronto."}

{"text":"For the price, service and quality of food I give this place five stars! It's not the best Thai food you can get in Toronto but it is pretty damn good for how cheap it is! I got the off the menu but infamous Islamic Thai Noodle and was completely satisfied. The portion was huge and it was only $10 for what's essentially two different dishes mixed into one. Definitely give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Salad King is brought to you today by the letter C: cheap, cheerful and central. 

VIBE 
In its new digs on Yonge street still nearby for those Ryerson students who need their food fix, I was most surprised that there was an elevator near the entrance. SK has really moved up since the fire of years yonder. 

For a casual dining option, the interiors are impressive. Bright and bold murals of cheeky sayings and colourful floral lamps that look modern really add a punch. 

But that said, Salad King still maintains its atmosphere of glorified cafeteria. Communal seating lends to many opportunities to eavesdrop on conversations. Also new are booths. There are plenty on the side. 

Service is friendly and quick as well. That said, Foursquare and Yelp were very useful in helping me choose a menu item. I don't think the staff would have revealed the secret menu item otherwise. 

THE FOOD 
I ordered a chicken satay. Four skewers with a generous helping of peanut sauce was very reasonable at $5. I wouldn't get it again though because even though it was real chicken, it didn't really taste like it and it was charred. 

The real surprise here was the Islamic Noodles - not on the menu. 
IT's pad thai noodles with their Panang Curry - Sweet Asian basil, peanut, lime leaf, bell pepper, Panang curry with coconut milk, served with steam rice.
All I have to say is GAT DAMN! Now it doesn't come close to Khao San Road's Sam Roas (which in my mind is the best pad thai I've ever had) but this one is full of flavour and the portions are PLENTIFUL! Plus, you'll get a nice chunk of broccoli in there so you can count your five a day. 

I got the chicken and shrimp and there were three pieces of shrimp in my bowl. I probably will just stick with chicken next time.

I like that they give you a pot of green tea as well. 

Note: their phud thai is not great as I've experienced in past visits. 

Total cost for an app, large sized main and green tea = $20

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
In terms of bang for buck, Salad King remains king of the castle. And atmosphere and space wise, this is a MAJOR step up from the old location. Kudos!"}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this place because I've enjoyed meals here before but my last experience here was ridiculous. I asked if they could make their \"pud thai\" without fish sauce, and they said no. They can't even just leave it out, which i'm sure wouldn't make it taste that much different, because the sauces are apparently all pre-made and pre-mixed together. There is actually a huge menu here but very little of it is vegetarian friendly because it all has fish sauce and can't be made without it. Even basic things that you'd think could be made vegetarian, like spring rolls or a currey, all follow this rule, which is surprising because thai is one of the few cuisines that has lots of options because there are lots of vegetarians in thailand due to buddhism being so prevalent. Even if you're not vegetarian, the fish flavour can be very pungent and overpowering and for lack of a better word, gross.

AAAnyway, she circled the 3 options I could have for a vegetarian entree, and I went with my usual, bangkok stirfry. Food doesn't take long at all. When it arrives i start eating it only find that it has chicken, now I'm not sure if i specified I wanted the vegetable one, but she never asked me to confirm which version (veggie, chicken, or shrimp) I wanted, and based on our conversation earlier I assumed she knew I wanted the veggie one. Well it had been about 5 minutes of sitting there not eating before she came back and I said this wasn't what i ordered but not to worry about bringing another. At this point I didn't want to play catch up with my girlfriend and I was already unimpressed by the menu and not even that hungry in the first place. So she says ok and the manager comes to see if everythings ok, I say yes so as not to be fussy.

So my girlfriend is finishing up and says that i was a little short with the waitress so when she comes to collect her plate I tell her I'm sorry if I was rude. She says no problem, but we're going to be charged for the order they got wrong, that her manager didn't want to take it off the bill. WTF? I ask to talk to him again and he comes over again and this time maybe I'm a little rattled and predisposed, but I really didn't like the cut of his jib. Anyway I had to go into detail about why the food was sent back and why i didn't want another and why i hadn't explained this before and he agreed to waive it off the bill. 

I wasn't going to write this review but my girlfriend who says she can't ever go back there and she was a regular before this, insisted that I should. She had waited around to bring takeout to her mom and the takeout process of ordering was way more haphazard and drawn out than eating in. After 10 minutes of waiting for her takeout they asked her if she had an order number or something like that and then it was back to square one. 

I'm gonna miss that sticky rice."}

{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Toronto! I've been going to Salad King since my early university days and I have seldom, if ever, had a bad experience here. The communal seating format is not the best but I've come to associate it with this place so i don't mind it much. The service is always extremely fast, the pricing has only slightly changed in the last decade and most importantly, the food is consistently DELICIOUS and served in huge portions. Best items on the menu have to be the veggie spring rolls, the chicken skewers, the green curry with chicken, the Thai fried rice and of course, the Islamic Thai noodles with chicken and shrimp. You just cannot go wrong with any of these. You can now also order it for delivery through Foodora, and it'll taste just as good at home. Solid 5/5."}
{"text":"Good food. Prompt service. Inexpensive. One of my favorites. I like the Hot Thai Noodles as a change of pace from usual Pad Thai. Can be cramped & noisy however when busy."}
{"text":"How do you review a Thai cafeteria? I joke, but the dining here is quite a unique experience. 

I was finally brought here after months of being told of its glory and tastiness. Too bad I wasn't warned about the set up. If you're up for an evening of yelling at your friends and hearing the discussion next to you, then this is the atmosphere for you. (I admit, I prefer quieter settings). Surprisingly, service is actually ok considering it's essentially a cluster of people crammed in together.

I ordered the Pad Thai and boy was it ever good! Authentic? Not so much. But tasty! And the portion size would explain why just about half of Ryerson university is chilling there. You are practically guaranteed leftovers at a very reasonable price! 

It's hard for me to give a star rating for a place like this because it is so out of the ordinary (and out of my comfort zone in terms of dining). But for what it delivers and promises, it's certainly worth 4 stars."}
{"text":"The food isn't too good anymore. When it used to be a small dump ages ago, I found the food to be better and then after the building was burned down when it was cafeteria style, it moved to the second floor of foot locker. The food was getting worse as the place grew bigger. 

I used to like their green and yellow curry but the pad Thai was also OK. I would only go there if I had no other places to go to in the area."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with their Thai Islamic Noodles! Pretty much the only dish I ordered since then. Don't get me wrong though - I also had their Siam Noodles and red and green curries which were decent. This place was quite popular among Ryerson students. Back as a student then, I gave it a try and I was not disappointed. Pretty loud environment with communal table settings though so not the best for intimate conversations. Nice decor."}
{"text":"My friend was in town and was craving Salad King, so we decided to go at lunch time during the week. I headed over early to snag a table. Unfortunately, they don't do this unless almost your whole party has arrived (they wanted 3 of 4 people there). So I stood around awkwardly in the entrance area for 10 minutes and watched other people be seated with a whole pile of empty tables behind me. Weird. 

We sat down and were catching up, so when the server came by once and then twice and we hadn't decided what we wanted, she said to just flag her down when we were ready. We took a while longer and then flagged her down, she nodded at us. And then 10 minutes go by and we had to flag her down again. 

I always get the sea queen, it's calamari with a honey lime sauce and rice. Soooo tasty. The calamari is always tender and the sauce is badass. We also got the spring rolls they were huge and quite tasty! 

I know Salad King is a super popular spot but it doesn't hold much appeal for me. I dislike the bench seating they have there, I don't like being shoulder to shoulder with strangers while I eat. The food is great but the not so great service and not being able to hold a table while you wait for your party arrives is frustrating. It's also super ridiculously noisy. Like almost yelling across the table to talk noisy. Not a fan!"}
{"text":"Would give this place zero stars if I could. The service here is terrible.  Came for late dinner around 9pm, restaurant was half empty and was refused to be seated because only 2 out of 3 people in our party were here.  While I was waiting another guest came in and asked for a table of 2 and was seated immediately even though she was by herself. Asked to speak to a manager and the hostess laughed at my face. Then one of the servers came over and told us if we didn't like the rules, then we should just leave.

Have been coming here for over 10 years, but the food and service has been going downhill. Will never be coming back, and I'll make sure everyone I know doesn't either."}
{"text":"Really delicious. I finish my plate every time I come here. especially ever since I've learned about the Islamic noodle that's not on the menu!

The Thai iced tea here is also pretty good and I usually order it with my meal.

For the food I would give 5* for what I usually order, but I would subtract 1 star for the cramped communal tables..I usually have to sit with my jacket in my lap :("}
{"text":"Like everyone else has said, get the Thai Islamic noodles, go spicey with them, the cream will balance things out."}
{"text":"Ok So I've been here 3 more times since my first review ( I CANT GIVE UP ON SALAD KING).  2 time was for take out.  One of my take out they gave me the wrong order BUT BUT The up side was nothing at salad king is bad so I didn't mind trying something new and now I have something I quite enjoy.

The food after 2 weeks has FINALLY started getting a little better, the sauce for the pad thai is finally tasting as it use to.  My Islamic noodles also make me very happy now.  

Few Key Notes However:
- Food is SMALLER
- Prices have gone up about $0.50-$1.50.  (Probably to cover the loss of revenue but do you think they'll lower the price AFTER they regain it...probably not)
- Place is A LOT nicer than the older one
- Take out takes a LONG time...Longer than if you were to sit and eat your meal. BUT Take out is LARGER than when you sit and eat


The one thing I don't like about Salad King which is actually one of its more charming qualities others would think is the way they seat people.  I don't mind sitting next to people, in a movie i'd rather not sit with someone right beside me but if there are no seats no problem.  I'm from Asia I'm very use to sharing a table.  Now the last time I sat here I had the most obnoxious girl talking about how her daddy buys her 1000 dollar purses every week and how she'll never marry a man that cant pay for her every expense.  Being a woman and being very independent I wanted to fling pad thai with chili right into her eyes.  And it wasn't like she was quite it was as if her voice was attempting to overthrow the ENTIRE restaurant.  Again, I love Salad King, not to hot with the seating arrangement.  


Overall, I love this place! And when I have time I WILL ALWAYS WAIT FOR TAKE OUT! 

Cost: 2 people, 1 app, 2 mains, $27.
Food quality: 5/5
Food quantity: Unsure as of yet
Service: 4/5

Would I Go Again: Of Course."}
{"text":"I love going here even though I order the same thing every time; Golden Tofu something or other.

Love the community vibe of having to share table. Where else are you gonna overhear a guy ask if he should take his shirt off because it's so hot out and you get to chime in and find a funny, light way to say \"no\". 

Yes you will wait for a table so don't go as a group and you will wait less time. 

Service is always great, I haven't a single complaint."}
{"text":"The Thai food scene in Toronto has taken off lately. If you are aching for some really good Thai food, this place might not be for you. Having that said, Salad king is a fine place for a bite for run-of-the-mill Thai dishes.

My favourite dish here is their golden curry which is quite tasty. Prices are cheap and you can get a decent dish for around $12-13 (after tax+tip)

The place is quite busy on weekends, and it is almost always quite loud. Communal seating in the middle of the restaurant can be charming and annoying at the same time.

A thing I do notice here is that service tends to be slow. Food comes fast once you ordered, but the hard part is waiting for your server....and the same happens when you want to pay. If you are in a rush and think this is a place for a quick meal, you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"Salad king was great. Fast service, great selection, tasty food and well priced. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Salad King, personified, would be my new girlfriend.  

My favourite dish is the Spicy Fish, followed by the Spicy Muscles.  For less than $10, you get a huge helping of green shell muscles, and are they ever MEATY!  We always chuckle at the Evil Jungle Prince, but have not ventured to try it.  Spring rolls are top notch, as are the appetizer soups (hot and sour mushroom is delicious and leaves you with a dry chili throat).  

5 chilies max for me.  My friend Mike always adds their tabled chili sauce, and then bitches about indigestion all afternoon."}
{"text":"Friday night, I was looking for a casual dinner, decided to hit up a favourite Thai spot of mine: Salad King. It was not too busy (but it can have a big line ups on some nights) and managed to be seated quickly. 

Take note: if you want back support in your chairs the common eating area's seats don't have back support and can cause discomfort or discomfort with unknown people sitting beside you. There is areas with cushions padded seats but they seems to always booked or filled up:(

Anyways we sat there for 10 minutes before we got water. We actually ordered before we got water which is a restaurant faux pas in my eyes and even our waiter seemed confused that we didn't have water (but it was no biggie) as he quickly went to get it for us. 

Ordered off the \"secret menu\" which isn't really a secret it was a special that was popular and kept around even though the promo placard were taken down. The Islamic Noodles is a combination of a delicious saucy noodles with carrot slices, onions, broccoli, chicken and egg bit. 

The food is the reason why I keep coming back and I do recommend this for its price, quick service and food for something causal and fun."}
{"text":"Their Islamic noodles (from the hidden menu) are really amazing. Depending on the cook, sometimes you get lots of sauce, and sometimes just enough. 
When you order chilis for spice, remember they can vary. I've ordered a 5 that felt like a 4 or 3, and sometimes it felt like a 6 or 7. 
They are usually very quick, even though they can be very busy from the lunch crowd. Coming at 3pm is a good time to avoid the lunch and dinner crowd."}
{"text":"Meh. I was told by a couple of people that it was very \"authentic\" tasting but I found it very Canadianized Thai. After spending 4 months in Thailand last year I have missed green papaya salad as many establishments here don't have it on the menu. I was excited to see it here and ordered it. Bland bland bland. The \"panang\" is soupy and more of a red curry with bizarre textured chicken and overcooked rice. More effort went into the decor than the authenticity of the food."}
{"text":"The last time I'd been to Salad King was at its old location across the street. This was a few years ago, so I was excited to check it out at its new location. It was just as packed as ever, and the service was efficient and pleasant. I also liked the communal dining style. 

However, the dish I'd ordered was not that good at all - I had ordered the Khao Soi which is one of my favourite Thai dishes. It had such a strong fishy taste that it totally detracted from the other flavours. I probably wouldn't go again on my own accord but tag along if someone else wanted to check it out. I'd also definitely order something different - maybe the green curry because who would screw up a green curry, right?"}
{"text":"Got the rainbow chicken. Was terrible. The sauce tasted liked anything but Thai. Service was super slow. Avoid... There's bunch of other thai spots in the area."}
{"text":"Here's a fun story!

My father and I went into the restaurant tonight to enjoy a meal after hearing cool things! So we drive 45 minutes from Oakville to check the place out and were told there's a small wait. When were taken to our table (which held 4 people), it was one with no back supports and being an Ontarian with a back disability, I was not able to sit in that position for too long so we requested the empty 4 seater booth next to it. The amazingly friendly woman at the front said we had to ask the manager if we were able to sit there, so he comes over acting like he didn't know what was going on and we explain how I had a back problem and JASON told us we were not able to sit at the open booth. My jaw dropped and we decided to leave. Nowhere else in Canada would this ever happen. We were politely told to screw off because of my disability. WILL NEVER RETURN AND WILL ADVISE FRIENDS TO NEVER GO AGAIN."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Salad King since I first started studying at Ryerson six years ago. Over the years, the portion sizes have shrunken noticeably, but since it hasn't really affected the quality, I am happy to go back whenever I'm in the neighbourhood.

My two all time favourites are the unbeatably creamy and satisfying vegetable (or beef) panang curry with rice on those God awful blizzardy Toronto nights and the savoury yet sweet and limey bangkok stirfry (with shrimp or chicken) of glass noodles and oodles of veggies for warmer days. 

If you've also got a sweet tooth like me, try the warm and sticky coconut rice with fresh mango slices too.

To avoid a long wait for seats, go with just one other person. It can get a little too loud for good conversation across the canteen table though. Complimenting strangers' food selections or making suggestions for first timers have been well received and provided good vibes in the past. I also enjoy going alone sometimes and snagging one of the elevated seats in front of the window to pedestrian watch."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since just after the original location burned down. The food is always consistent. It's good. 

The one major problem I have with the place lately is that no matter how often you come, no matter how well you tip, you're never remembered. Believe me, I'm a regular and coming here is part of our routine. The staff here doesn't change THAT much but it does. 

That being said we've been greeted by the same of two hostesses for the past year and a half and we may as well be meeting them for the first time every time. 

Our preferences are not unreasonable and we never ask for something they cannot do. But some care into recognizing regular beyond a tacky \"chili club card\" would be great. I've met street vendors who serve way more customers who still treat regulars with respect and recognition. 

The Saturday evening hostess now gives you attitude and it's most unpleasant. 

I know that's it a a popular Ryerson student spot and a few of the staff are students too, but students are paying customers too, just as much as they are people. I'm not a student but I see how people are treated now. It sucks. 

In the 6 years I've been coming here regularly, I've noticed that the quality of service has suffered. 

Even as I type this I noticed 3 servers see a napkin fall on the ground by the bar area, look at it or kick it, but not actually pick it up and discard it. 

I would give the Salad King 4 stars or higher like I used to but I can't when things I've fallen this far. 

It doesn't take much effort to make a customer happy. Failing to do so, even with minimal effort, is a failure on the entire establishment. 

Improve please."}
{"text":"My favourite Thai restaurant! I love the green curry with shrimp and mango sticky rice there!"}
{"text":"My favorite thai place in Toronto, one of the few places that you can get really spicy food. Service isn't anything to write home about, but the food is great and things come quickly."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went there one night to have dinner. He and I both got the Hot Thai noodle dish and 2 hours later got major food poisoning!! The worst experience ever! Never going there again."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. My boyfriend and I were craving some Thai food and this was in the area. Its located on the 2nd floor about a 3min walk from Eaton centre. 

In my opinion, the place was poorly designed. It didn't feel like a restaurant but more like a cafeteria. 
It wasn't that busy during the time I went but the waiters didn't really check up on us and walked by even when they saw that we had no water left. The seats were also dirty and had no back rest.

The food was okay, I ordered the chicken phud Thai at a 3 spice level and my boyfriend got the green curry at a 5 spice level. It tasted like any other Thai place, nothing out of the ordinary. I personally wouldn't come here again, the food and the place in general didn't seem that clean to me."}
{"text":"Very tasty and healthy food. Not much else to say. Seems to be always busy which says something. Offers many levels of spice for your choosing."}
{"text":"I keep wondering why they named this restaurant Salad King when they actually serve Thai food, but then again that's not really a big issue. The important thing is they make wonderful food, specifically SHRIMP PAD THAI! I keep coming back for this particular dish-- always served hot, fresh and flavourful. Chicken pad thai is good too. The portion is huge, which is why I make sure I'm hungry when I come here.. I've tried some of their curries but I find them ordinary and a bit less exciting, which is why I'm sticking to pad thai whenever I visit. Service is fast and excellent and prices are very reasonable.The place can get really loud and noisy during peak hours, but for me that gives it life and personality. It's fun coming here with friends, but it's perfectly all right dining here alone as well. Salad King has a modern, vibrant and energetic take on Thai food and I'm loving it!"}
{"text":"I went to Salad King for the first time yesterday and I have to say it was such a pleasant surprise! I have passed by it many times but never knew it was a Thai restaurant! 

I ordered the vegetable pad Thai, for $10 this is an amazing deal! Such a generous portion too. Definitely better than Thai Express for around the same price. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I used to love it here, but the service sucked and my curry tasted like coconut milk,  not like curry.   I asked if there was anything they could do to give the dish more flavor and the waitress brought me red chilli paste for my green curry.   When I hardly ate it, she didn't bother asking if everything was okay.   This place used to be home, but now I'd much rather stick to Ginger across the street."}
{"text":"SALAD KING IS NOT SALAD, ITS THAI FOOD!

If you go to Ryerson, Salad King is definitely a staple to your diet.
This place gets packed all the time! Dinner on a Friday night can mean 20min + wait times. Seating is packed and place is loud. 

Everything here is delicious. I've tried their tomyum soup, green curry, pah thai noodles, siam noodles,.. You can also choose your spiciness level. Beer towers for groups of 3+. 

Whether you're on a student budget or not, portions are big and will leave you with breakfast/lunch for the next day. Cheap good food fast."}
{"text":"two words. islamic noodle

you cannot experience salad king without ordering that its beyond amazing.

ive tried their chicken and beef satay -both were good!

mango salad: uh no. sorry but ive had thai mango salad and it tastes nothing like this. it was covered in a straight up lime marinade. with unripe green mango. cmon even spring roll's mango salad is better.

basil beef-flavourful sauce and good amount of meat in it. perf for a warm me up winter meal if u add 3-5 chilis 

panag curry- the same curry thats in the islamic noodles. so ya get it. u wont regret it

thai iced tea- interesting...it does have a unidentifiable aftertaste. doesnt taste like other thai iced teas ive had so i wouldnt order it lol"}
{"text":"1. the service is BAD. They make you feel that you owe them something. 2/3 of my experience. I have a feeling the waiters and waitresses are underpaid. 2. you feel like you are in a school canteen with benches and aluminum tables. 3. If you don't mind 1 and 2, food is so-so. OK given the price, but don't expect restaurant service."}
{"text":"I have frequented Salad King for many years and I have to say that since moving to the new location on Yonge Street, above Foot Locker, I've been really disappointed with the food.

The interior is really cool and there is great ambiance with their cafeteria-like long table seating. The decor is funky and they have cool little quotes on the way to the bathrooms, but the food really leaves nothing but disappointment since moving to the new locale.

The portions for one have gotten smaller. The have also changed their chilis/flames - I used to get a 7 or a 10 flame (I like my food spicy!) but am now doing a 5-flame, which really has a different flavour than before - it's more \"hot\" than flavourful. The pad thai has really become awful - I've had it on my last 2 visits (the second time around, I'd forgotten that I'd ordered it the last time and didn't enjoy it - it's such a staple, you would expect it to be good in a Thai restaurant). It was very, very dry, mostly just noodle, with very little chicken and veg. It wasn't very flavourful, just mostly hot. It's definitely not a dish that I would order again - I have had much better Pad/Phud Thai at other restaurants and I'm sad to see that it's gone this way...

The Golden Curry is another staple we always order, and it's still decent, although again, much smaller of a portion, and somehow less flavourful from before. Bangkok Stirfry is the same deal. I'd have to say I'm not as keen on going back as I used to be, which says a lot about someone who was completely addicted to this place in the past. Disappointed, to say the least... seems like more expensive rent and reno's have really put a damper on things.."}
{"text":"Very consistently good food and fast service! I've liked everything i've tried and will continue to go back here! I go here whenever i'm in the area DT and feel like thai food.  Prices are reasonable and the place is always busy (most i've waited is 15 minutes for seating). They've got some communal tables and a lot of normal ones.  Some staff are more helpful than others.

I almost always get the pad thai and an appetizer and have never been disappointed.

I like their star ratings for spice: 3 stars is mild, 5 stars has a very nice kick (if you like spicey food, otherwise don't go above 3). I don't think i could handle 10, but i like being able to get a consistent spiciness."}
{"text":"I've procrastinated about writing a Salad King review pretty much since I joined Yelp. 

Why? 

I don't know. 

Most likely, because it seems like everyone and his uncle has visited the King at some point. If you're downtown and hungry, it's one of the few cheap(isn) eats spots around. 

Probably, because the place has evolved ever-so-slowly; from dirty, cheap, fabulous hole-in-the-wall slinging excellent Thai food for peanuts just off the Ryerson Campus, to slick, stainless-steel-shared-seating spot overlooking the strip. Fancier location, higher prices, better publicity mean Salad King is no longer one of Toronto's best-kept secrets. 

Yet the food is still reliably good. While not cheap enough to warrant an undergrad visit, it still beckons me for lunch from my office, and I'll still propose it to friends or to my wife when we're in the area. 

Veggie spring rolls are tight, crispy little mores with crunchy-fresh veg. Sold as a tray of 3, you can ask politely for one as a side order. Do this. 

Noodle soups are a tad plain compared to the Ramenterias and Pho shacks about town, but filled with fresh veg, seafood and springy noodles they're welcome when I'm under the weather.  

Tom Yum is puckeringly sour, and just hot enough without trekking up SK's legendary chill scale. Uncharacteristically, I prefer the Coconut soup; less heat but tonnes of mouthfeel. 

Mains are variations on a theme: noodles, curries, stir-fries, all subject to the Scale-customize your heat level until you obliterate all other flavours, if you wish-though doing so would be a mistake, especially with the curries, which balance layers of flavour with tender-cooked shrimp or chicken and veggies. 

Golden curry is mildest on it's own, but packs an umami wallop, and has the biggest variety of vegetables. Bits of deep-fried tofu are always welcome. The green curry is spicier, and demands a shot of mouthwash before you head back to the office It does get the endorphins going, though. 

Late NOW Magazine reviewer Steven Davey praised SK's Pad Thai for it's lack of ketchup. I agree, and endorse these noodles for the generosity of protein and veg; the tofu and scrambled egg components alone rank this dish high. In recent years i discovered their curry version, which combines the best of Singapore rice noodles with standard PT. More savoury and less sweet, it's become a favourite. Now off-menu, the Islamic Noodles are an even better mash-up. Straight-up pad thai with curry sauce. Mind=blown. 

I don't usually get excited for stir fries, but single out \"Evil Jungle Prince\" for its name alone. There's some damn fine caramelized eggplant in there, too. 

Drinks? Dessert? Who has room? Or tastebuds, after all those chills?"}
{"text":"How I would have loved to have a hot looking cafeteria like this one when I was in school!  I really loved the colourful asian inspired wall art, the long stainless steel tables, the wide open space and semi open kitchen, and the great amount of natural light.

The service here was super friendly and efficient, and the food is fairly priced.  

As I was warmly recommended to try Salad King, I had high expectations on the food.  I ordered one of my favorite meals, the \"Hot Chicken with Cashews\"... and was a bit disappointed; although the flavour and were there, the rice wasn't sticky and the sauce was more of a broth (not thick enough... or at all, actually) which made it impossible to eat with chopsticks. 

This said, I am not closed to the idea of giving it another chance on my next trip to Toronto.

NB: For those who like their food with some kick, you can add some spiciness to whichever plate you choose (see Karine V.'s photo: http://bit.ly/k0aU6f)...  Which makes me wonder; did anyone ever try a meal with an \"20 chilis\"?

PS: If you have to use the restrooms, you might like the intimacy the individual stalls offer (each of which has its own sink) whether you need to freshen up, touch up your makeup or... want some alone time with your bo ;-)"}
{"text":"I had the wonton soup and the Thai Islamic noodles (not in the menu). The wonton soup was yummy but I've had better.  The Thai Islamic noodles were addictive! I don't even understand why they aren't in the menu. Thank god I read the reviews before ordering or I wouldn't have known about them. It is the perfect combination of flavours spicy, sweet and savoury! All for 15 bucks! I love cheap eats:) and the portion size was generous"}
{"text":"Communal seating so you'll be eating in front of and next to strangers if you aren't dining with a friend. Extremely loud atmosphere but service is great and the food is as well."}
{"text":"Get a secret dish NOT on the menu: Thai Islamic Noodles with chicken and shrimp. You won't regret it. That stuff is delicious."}
{"text":"Worst Tom yum soup I've had in my Tom yum history of tasting. Lol... Tasted like water aka nothing. The pad Thai is alright tho & thai tea can do better."}
{"text":"\"Excuse me, do you need some more water? I warned you 7 Chilis would be VERY spicy!!!\"

\"No, actually...these are tears of joy.\"

I really did cry a little bit (and GASP) upon discovering the lights ON at Salad King today. Clearly, it was God's master plan for me to have this FTR. (Thank you, God)

I quickly dashed across Yonge St and climbed the stairs (but they have a swanky elevator too!) to Salad King's new 2nd floor location on the west side of Yonge. 

My face was beaming. The new space is beautiful. Nice decor, HUGE, with a good mix of the large communal dining tables and tables for a party of 4. 

I was seated promptly and did a quick count - looks like enough seating for around 170 diners. Nice, they will need all of those seats to feed cheap delicious Thai food to the masses.

While I perused the menu, people were frantically calling their friends to tell them the news. \"It's open, OMG, get down here!!!\"

The menu looks pretty much like the old location (no need to mess with a good thing) - numerous Thai curries, Thai soups, mango salad, meat dishes, seafood dishes, tofu dishes, fried rice and stir fry noodles. A few apps and a couple desserts. 

I went for the Street Noodle Soup at Chili Level 7. For those of you unfamiliar with the old Salad King - you can select from Level 1-20 Chili/spiciness. I'm told anyone rarely orders anything over a 10 though. (I'm totally trying 10 next time - but I'm a very advanced spice guru and although Level 7 burned my lips, I need more!)

They weren't messing around in the kitchen OR with the waitstaff. They had a good 2 dozen servers and the food was brought out FAST and it was spot-on delicious. My soup had a really nice homemade look, unlike the fluorescent looking Thai soups they serve up at lots of crappy Thai  food joints.

Considering they had just opened ONE HOUR prior to me arriving, this is an awesome sign that the service and food quality at the new Salad King location is going to be A++. I'd say they have been practicing for the opening.

Prices are still great - not a single menu item over $10

Hallelujah."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money adding a protein in your meal. It never tastes right because they add it to the dish last right before serving (I think). It doesn't catch the flavours of the curry/sauce well and is just meat.

Also they didn't have dessert... :("}
{"text":"The service is pretty and you can choose how spicy you want for your dish. I tried the 10 chilli Bangkok fry. It was sooooooo spicy but I really enjoyed it! Recommend the most tried fried noodles and the dish with rice. The soup is also pretty good."}
{"text":"Salad king is my go to restaurant whenever I'm in Toronto. 98% of the time I order Pad Thai and 2%, some other type of noodle with coconut milk (forgot the name). I decided to order green curry with brown rice. I've had really good Thai curry in Vancouver and was hoping salad king would be just as good. 

Serving size was huge! Nothing to complain about here! I love the amount of brown rice and curry I got. I felt I got the bang for the buck :) 

Taste - it was pretty good, not bad. But, I just can't forgo the taste of the Thai curry from baan wasani in Vancouver. The beef was a on the chewier side. 

Service - good 

Overall, I still will vouch for salad king over anything else in Toronto. I would recommend anyone wanting to try an inexpensive and tasty place 8)"}
{"text":"3 chili's - 3 stars

It's a lovely restaurant that is VERY busy. Prices are fair for the food but don't come here expecting authentic and delicious Thai food. 

It's tasty and great for a hangover, a bit on the greasy side... Thai iced tea is tasty but definitely not fresh. Also had a Ceasar, very disappointing!

The fast food of Thai food. Better than Thai Express ;)"}
{"text":"Casual ambience almost felt like a fast food restaurant. Had the golden curry and siam noodles pretty good. Will come again."}
{"text":"I'm happy to say my revisit to the King after a two year absence was very satisfying, enough to even call this review the Return of the King (no, I'm not a LOTR fan just like you, please don't message me about it).
The busy restaurant was packed as always around 7pm; long line forming right into the seats, no space on the coat rack and little elbow room between patrons (collectively -1 star!). 
Brushing up on my newly acquired skills of talking to total strangers (courtesy of NYC), I struck conversation with the dude next to me while waiting for the menus. The good man happened to be on a connection flight to New York (from Newfoundland), and let me know he had made this connection JUST so he can have the Golden Panang curry! My companion and I ordered 2 of the Panang, along with the Chicken Coco Milk soup and spring rolls. Needless to say the curry tasted amazing, and for the price, I definitely was not complaining about the portion.
In a nutshell, definitely give Salad King a try. Don't go in a group unless you want to wait or make reservations for the second floor."}
{"text":"I've always thought Salad King as just an average Thai restaurant until I ordered their Thai Islamic Noodles just recently. (thanks to the Yelpers' tips).
It's an off - menu dish which is a combination of Thai noodles with Penang Curry sauce. It has a creamy coconut saucy taste with a spicy kick to it (I ordered 5 chillis). 

I went there around 5:30 and seated at the end of the long table, so it was abit quieter than usual. 
Our server was amazing. He was always attentive and was very polite. 

1 star taken away for their awful Phud-Thai, and the noise level (although it is expected and
I complain about it how  every time I go, it probably won't stop me from going back :p)"}
{"text":"Clean place, correct food in a modern canteen decoration. Do not expect a high class or quality food, and it is not that cheap neither. Service is fast. Probably better there than in the regular thai green spicy fast food chain.

Had to try it. Done. Have been told it was much better and cheaper in the past..."}
{"text":"For whatever reason, I'm not much of a Thai food fan.  It is one of my least favourite of the Asian styles of food.  I've tried many Thai places in the city and none have really done it for me.  Salad King, on the other hand, is a different story.  I like everything about this place.  I like the cafeteria style seats, I like the service, I like the food.  The seating, believe it or not, actually makes people more social and conversations with strangers at the table are fairly common.  A rare sight, indeed, in this city.  The food prices are awesome for what you get.  Presentation is great, although that matters little to me, and the food is delicious.  To be honest, I have no idea how traditional Thai is or how faithful Salad King is to that, but I don't care, the food is great.  I really wouldn't have them change a thing."}
{"text":"I usually get the golden Curry beef and the Thai fried rice to go and it's amazing!!!

Great prices. Can't say for the dine in, but the take out fried rice comes in a huge container and is good when I reheat it a day later for lunch. 

I've tried between level 2-4 spicy and gotta say level 4 made me sweat. I could only eat a few bites at a time .......but somehow kept coming back for more =p!

The curries are all soooooo good. There's a rich sweetness of the coconut milk base that just enhances the complex aroma of spices that's simply mouthwatering to even think about as I write this review. 

All the dishes are about$10

Only complaint ..the seating... Great place for coming for a quick meal, with frds, but not for a first date! It's shared cafeteria style seating and can easily become pretty loud.

Definitely recommend giving this place a try if you're nearby!!!"}
{"text":"Go here if you want an ok but quick meal. Dont go here if you like Thai food. A mango paste on mango is not a Thai mango salad lol"}
{"text":"Love it! They're not afraid to give you spice! Be warned their chilli scale is dangerous !"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place every week before the original location burned down and loved it! I've noticed since they moved locations that a few of the dishes have been removed from the menu and the quality of chicken used in each dish isn't great. I would recommend any dish without chicken and you won't be disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Salad King more than I'd like to admit. Despite its name, Salad King serves average Thai food, but comes in a generous portion and is fairly priced. Spiciness of the dish is to your discretion which is nice to have a choice. The not-so-secret Islamic noodles is always a popular choice. We usually order this with chicken and shrimp (one of the few dishes which you can get both in). 

The cramped cafeteria style seating isn't really to my liking but it provides them with ample seating and a high turnover rate. There are baskets beneath the seat to store your belongings while you eat because there's absolutely no room to leave anything lying around. 

Overall, the food is good if you aren't too picky about authenticity. It's cheap, large portions that comes quickly, and I really can't complain about the taste."}
{"text":"Serving sizes smaller than I remember.
Prices a little higher than I remember.
Place feels a little bigger than before.
Food is still delicious.

I wonder if their takeout size is still gigantic, because I miss the days when we'd get two takeout dishes and eat it for two days!"}
{"text":"Funny how they call it salad king but only have 1 salad on the menu.

It's located right by Ryerson, so it's definitely convenient for students on a budget. The atmosphere was like a cafeteria, but a pinch more upscale with cuter decor than a typical highschool lunch hall.

Like most Thai places, they had sizeable portions. My friend and I ordered the pad thai and the panang curry to share. Overall, the food was meh. It made me full, but not the happy kind of full. The panang curry was too sweet but not rich, and the pad thai was a little dry. 

Highly recommend hot sauce if you're thinking of eating at this place.

But I wont go back again."}
{"text":"2 people. lunch time. Busy as usual. Greeted by nice and pretty waitress. Seated in less than 1 min. Noisy and cheerful environment I like that. Order food. Roughly 10min wait. Got the Pataya chicken, friend got Phud Thai and a side dish of spring rolls. All delicious. Washroom clean. -1 star for taking forever to refill my water. Would eat here again. Ye"}
{"text":"Three star quality but overall four star simply because it bas always been consistent and well, delicious.  Not authentic by any means but a casual, decent and comfortable place to eat.  Mostly cafeteria seating, similar to thatnof Asian street food/casual dining. 

Pad Thai is decent, but my no any means true to Thailand.  Portions of mains are fairly large and I tend to take any leftover home for lunch the next day.  One of my favourite on the menu, rather \"Secret Menu\" is the Islamic Noodles which has green pepper, onions, mushroom, carrots and rice noodles in a flavourful peanut coconut sauce.  

Another favourite of mine is their spicy scale--three chillies is just under medium spice, my go to is about 6-7.

Ginger tea was ok--would not get it again as it is quite pricy for what it is.  In general teas are $3 which is fairly pricy for 'cafeteria style.

Nostalgia is what it is.  Not your greatest Thai food in the city but I'm happy it's around."}
{"text":"I went here twice. The first time, I got the pad thai noodles and it was really good but I do not regularly eat peanuts, it does blend in well with the noodles though. I noticed how small the spaces were but it did hold a lot of people. The second time, I got their islamic noodles (part of their secret menu) and it was ok but was not it a big fan of it as there was too much coconut milk in it and my friends agreed as well. It's a good spot for Ryerson students but I do not think I will be coming back only during times where I catch up with friends."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to come for a quick lunch. Fast service and food comes to you quickly. I'd recommend the Islamic noodles or their green Curry. There's better Thai places in Toronto but if you're looking for a quick bite,  this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My wife always talked about this place for years and I had never gone. One day we made plans with friends and tried out this place...we've been back 4 more times after that time in the matter of 6 months. We've even taken friends from out of town here.

This place is always busy. And there's a good reason for that...it's amazing food! They are friendly and so accommodating. They inform you on the spice levels, the ingredients, and anything else you want to know. 

We've had their Phud Thai, fried rice, and curries...all which taste amazing. Their service is also on point except for one time where we had someone that seemed like she didn't care to work there. But the food...that's what we really go for and we have not been disappointed. Now I know what the craze is about this place."}
{"text":"This is my favourite casual Thai joint.

Nothing fancy, but always clean inside and the seats are comfy, the decor nice, and the servers always friendly and very fast service. Prices not super cheap but reasonable for what you get (the portions are a decent size).

Its always pretty busy but can generally get a table without much of a wait.

Has your standard Thai dishes. My favourites are the islamic noodles (not on the menu), and green curry. I always ask for 3 chilis as even the 2 chili which they say is \"hot\" is not even mild imo. 

One downfall and the reason for 4 stars and not 5 - the food doesn't always come out piping hot. On more than one occasion it was served luke warm and although the taste was still great, it needs to be hot and steamy for it to be perfect. I think I will request it extra hot (heat wise) in the future and see if they can accommodate.If so they will get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"So I finally got to check this place out after hearing about all the hype from friends. It's right across from Ryerson and has a small entrace with \"Salad King\" on top. You'd have to walk up a flight upstairs since the restaurant is located on the second floor.

I was reading the reviews on yelp and the Islamic noodles were recommened. So my friend and I gave it a shot. The hint of spice added a good taste to it however, I found it to be a tad bit too sweet. You can definitely tatse the coconut milk in the sauce. Overall, it was a good dish. 
We also ordered the Bangkok Stir Fry noodles. Nothing special in taste. Just glass noodles stir fried with assorted veges and chicken (or shrimp, if you like shrimp). 
The Thai Ice tea had a distinctive taste to it; it tasted more like a milk tea than ice tea. Also, it can get awfully loud which is quite hard to maintain a conversation. 

Service was attentive and the food came pretty fast. However, I was turned off with our server's manner. He brought my friend and I a plate and my plate looked a bit dirty. He rubbed it with his fingers then handed it to me.. At first I thought it was just a scratch on the plate but when I tried cleaning it with my napkin.. It was actually residue. This makes me question their sanitary level in the kitchen...

I just felt that the food does not reflect the high volume of hype its getting..."}
{"text":"Ever since they moved to their new location, they are definitely more efficient. I never had to wait long for a table. They are so consistent with their food.
My favourite is the panaang curry. I have tried it at so many thai restaurants but they never measure up."}
{"text":"The reviews here are a perfect reflection of both how I feel and why Salad King is listed at the #1 'Cheap Eats\" on Urban Spoon for Toronto. Amazing selection of Thai food with a sliding scale of hotness for each dish. I won't think twice about where to eat the next time I'm downtown."}
{"text":"This is my ultimate craving. Whenever im in the mood for something it is 95% of the time the pad thai with 13 chillis. Im serious. I love the burning and the water chugging. This is the place for cheap, cheerful, and filling thai food.

Im not a fan of the islamic noodles nd i think thats because they werent spicy enough for me... the coconut milk really kills the heat. 

I dont think ive eaten anything else here to be honest. Love Salad King!"}
{"text":"Awesome place - yummy thai food, good prices, decent atmosphere. Great for catching up with friends. We tried the Islamic noodles (on the secret menu) - it's a mix of the Hot Thai Noodles and Panang Curry. We also ordered the Beef Satay as appetizer. The portion was big so we were glad to share it between the 2 of us. Friendly service. Unisex washrooms. We would come back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Whatever, I'm not that hard to please. But I am hard to *impress*, like the way everyone who took me there was impresssed with Salad King.
My sister and her friends (all Ryersonians) were so excited about going that I was accordingly excited about being invited along for what revealed itself to be something of a beloved ritual.  

Well, no disrespect meant (it's certainly better than the food I usually have access to when on *my* former campus), but it's really nothing special, as far as I can tell. They do that litter \"pepper meter\" or whatever they call it, and nobody likes shtick more than this guy right here, but all I remember was that my mango chicken was *far* too watery for it to be on purpose. It was ok, certainly not spectacular. The spring rolls were from the right side of the tracks (ie. good, in springroll town). 

Oh, and it was super crowded. Is. Always."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, but the location is good (close to Ryerson, and Eaton Center) and the actual look and atmosphere of the resto was cool. It was kind of awkward though cos when it gets busy, they start to put different couples or groups completely side by side - on the same table since their tables are really long. But at least everything was really cheap!

I had 'Sea Queen' recently, with 3 chilli. The squid tastes like nothing, but the sauce that came with it was okay (3 chilli = sauce completely filled with chilli flakes). I also had 'Mango chicken' before and it was okay lol not amazing. I heard their curry was good tho"}
{"text":"King? Maybe. Salad? Not so much.

Well, what I mean by that is that it was good, hence yes to the 'King' part, but I really didn't understand why it had 'Salad' in the name considering most options were rice and noodle based with chicken, shrimp or beef. Yes, there were vegetarian options, but not to the point where they can be called Salad King!

Anyway, don't let the outside of this place fool you. It's like a little hole in the wall type deal from the outside. Small entrance, you have to climb to flights of stairs to get there. It gives you the impression that it'll be some small place with less seating and quick service - but not at all! It's actually extremely spacious from the inside. The seating arrangement is a mix of tables and long benches that basically seat separate groups of people next to each other.

The menu is pretty extensive. We were recommended the Islamic Noodles by a friend so that's what we ordered. The helpings seemed fairly large so we decided to share one (turned out to be a decent decision because we weren't super hungry). The noodles arrived fairly quickly. Oh, I should mention they also have various options for spice. We went with level 3 which turned seemed like the right decision in the end. The waitress said she usually orders between a 7 and 12 - I'm not sure how she survives. 

As mentioned, the helping was large which is always a plus. It was flavourful, it had a nice mix of vegetables and we ordered it with chicken which in the end was probably less than we would've liked. Overall, it wasn't out of this world but it was definitely very good. The price was just north of $11. 

In the end, a 4/5 because it was a happening place yet the food didn't take very long to arrive. We were very satisfied with our meal, and the price wasn't crazy. Waitress was also friendly and willing to help out with our order - although I'm glad we didn't go with her spice level!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere! Came here at lunch time, it was busy but got seated very quickly. No separate tables, long communal tables, adds to the friendly ambiance. Servers were extremely friendly and helpful. We had the satay chicken skewers which were amazing! We were starving so they came out really fast. The Pattaya chicken is amazing. Not too spicy, has a sweet and sour taste. Even though it was in a sauce the breaded chicken was so crispy. We also had the pad Thai in garlic sauce with shrimp and chicken. It was so good, but spicier than we expected. Went well with the sweet chicken. The coconut water was so refreshing. We had so much food to take home, and price was very reasonable too. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"A cheap lunch or dinner Thai place with good food.
They have a wide selection of food in their menu and you can add chicken or shrimp or tofu to most of them.
The spice levels range from 1 to 20,20 being TOO HOT TO HANDLE.
I usually order the 5 spice level,although in some of the dishes even 5 gets bit too much.
I am a big fan of their Green Curry,Golden curry and Pad Thai with either veggies or chicken.
Do get their mango ice cream in the end for dessert.
The seating is very tight and it is a big table with lots of stools.The private area where there are proper seats is generally reserved or full.
The way they make you sit,you almost feel like you are having food with other people  which I do not like.You can hear them talk and stuff too.
It feels like a big college canteen which is fine sometimes but some days I want to be far from unknown people.Also,it is always crowded and there is always a wait of around 5-10 mins"}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times, because i was pressured to. Food is not tasty at all.. SERVICE IS HORRIBLE, and the servers are soooooo extremely rude.. not going there ever again"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Great place for university students. The decor is that of a cafeteria with the open concept kitchen. I'll go if I'm really hungry and want something fast and cheap."}
{"text":"Salad King Restaurant is good if you want a Cheap Fast meal of something resemble Thai food in the area.  Eating here alone sharing a communal table did give me memory flash back of eating in a University cafeteria. 

Khao Soi ($8.50) has this really nasty funny colour but lack the complex flavor. The yellow noodle which suppose to be egg noddle was not really the \"real\" thing. But on this cold winter day, I was happy to be warmed up with a hot soup.

Will I be back? Probably not, but not a bad choice comparing to eat in a food court. At least I am eating out from a real utensils and bowl instead of some Styrofoam.

Singha beer large format (22oz) for $8.75? Beer... I might come back for some beers.. and I will need 20 chilies!!"}
{"text":"Our hotel concierge recommended this, he was Asian, we said we wanted authentic delicious, the best Thai Food.  He told us he always goes to Salad King.  Reviews were very meh.  I could get the same Thai food in Detroit at Sy Thai, I don't need to travel to Toronto to get average Thai Food.  The atmosphere feels like a mall cafeteria, very loud, tired shoppers all over.  Tons of people.  Prices weren't too bad.  Nothing specatular.

We got the Pad Thai, and some curry dishes but nothing screamed out delicious or stood out.  

Would not recommend."}
{"text":"As a Ryerson grad, I believe I am entitled to say whatever I want about Salad King. I have eaten there so many times that I think I have the menu memorized. I recall a handful of awkward first dates that took place there. And it is the only restaurant to date that I feel comfortable eating at by myself (the window seats are so awesome for that).

BUT. I am so back and forth about Salad King. I love love love their Siam Noodles (with a delicious peanut/coconut sauce), and their Green Curry is probably my favourite thing in the world. They have great vegetarian dishes, lots of selection, a generally efficient staff, and lots of water refills (which is totally necessary when you can decide how many chilis you get in your food).

And yet I can't stand being there. Their cafeteria setup drives me up the wall. The last time I went, I was surrounded by the most annoying people in the world, and of course, they're so close to you that instead of talking, they're basically yelling in your ear. The great thing about being in restaurants is that you get to talk to the person you're with -- at Salad King, your conversation is broadcast along the whole table.

If you have reservations or a big enough group, try to make your way up to Linda -- I haven't been up there yet, but I hear it's much better. Or get take out to try how good their food really is. Unless you like being squashed and listening to other people's loud, irritating voices. I sure don't."}
{"text":"He recommended this restaurant to us, OR we will NEVER find it haha.
It was located on the second floor along the Yonge St. I have tried the Sea Queen, which was so good. Sweet and spicy fried squid roll, with special sauce. 
Thai milkshake was strange and the pink was too fake. Thai ice tea was also unique, but once you get used to that taste, you will like it."}
{"text":"I've been searching for authentic Thai good in Toronto and finally I've found it! Did take out and got the pad thai and green curry, both chicken, and they we're spot on. They both tasted like what I ate everyday for a month in Bangkok, Chang Mai, and the southern islands. No complaints, super yummy and reasonably priced. Sure is a terrible restaurant name though."}
{"text":"I have been here many different occasions and I must say that my experience has always been a bit variable.

The first time I came here was with my boss and colleagues. My colleague arrived 5 minutes earlier then the rest of us and they refused to seat her until the entire party was here. We made a reservation and the table was ready so I wasn't too clear on why they made her wait, but just be aware of the policy. They WILL NOT seat your party until every single person has arrived, which can be irritating if someone is running particularly late.

Another time, I went for an early lunch at 11:30am and we were seating effortlessly. Keep in mind that this location fills up very quickly around noon. If you want to beat the lunch crowd I would recommend eating at 11:30, as there were many tables free when we arrived. I have also ordered food from salad king through an app called \"Ritual\" and have had a very good experience. They sometimes have specials and discounts for ritual members which is nice.

The food itself is very delicious. It is very customizable. You can change the amount of spiciness and change the meat options to shrimp, chicken or beef. There are also a lot of vegetarian options for those who do not eat meat. Everything is very reasonably priced at around $10-$15. For around $10 you can get a HUGE serving of curry pad thai with a choice of meat. I usually bring home what I can't finish and eat it as a snack later. They also have delicious curries that you can get with a generous amount of white rice. If you are looking for a cheap eat, or if you are working or going to school near dundas square i would recommend trying out salad king"}
{"text":"Had the kali noodle with 15 chilis and wasn't impressed with the spiciness. Was pretty weak in terms of spice. But the noodles tasted pretty good. Long lineup; and loud. Not good for business lunch."}
{"text":"Its cheap and I am a big fan of the seafood fried rice (although I avoid the squid because it feels like I'm chewing on a piece of tire). Its hard to seat big groups because its such a small place so a lot of the times there will be a wait time. Also, recently the curry has tasted watered down. Boo Salad King! Why??"}
{"text":"The food is sooooooo good! And suuuuper cheap!"}
{"text":"I came to this place without any expectations, not even knowing it was a Thai food place. It's not hard to find, since there's like a big protruding sign at the front, but you have to go up two flights of stairs once you step through the front doors, which threw me off a little.

It's a very open concept kind of dining experience, looks a bit like a canteen with like long metal tables and wooden seats. I came with one other person, and I guess we were lucky that the table beside us remained empty the whole time. Although I don't think it would have been a big deal sitting beside a stranger.

I ordered the Siam Noodle which I guess is similar to Pad Thai except for the sauce - the sauce was made from peanut and coconut milk and was so fragrant and delicious! I really enjoyed it and thought it was super interesting. It was $9.75 for my noodles (I got them with chicken) and the portion was pretty big, I had a really hard time finishing and felt like I got my money's worth. I also like that you can customize the spice level of any of the dishes here - good for people like me who can't handle the heat.

Given the setup of the restaurant, it is pretty loud, I wouldn't really recommend this place for like, a first date or anything, since it can make it a bit difficult to hold a conversation. Other than that, service was friendly and attentive, food came out reasonably fast, and I thought it was a pretty good lunch experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered $150 of take-out.  The Pad Thai was not very good, not a lot of flavour.  The Tom Yum soup I really enjoyed, although it's supposed to be hot they really made it very spicy (and I love spicy food).  The spring rolls (regular and seafood) were quite delicious.  We also got two fried rice which weren't really memorable.  What really annoyed me was when I went to pick up the food.  I asked for a side of fresh chilies and at first he said they don't really do that (which confused me).  I've dined in before and asked for fresh chilies and they obliged.  But when I asked for fresh chilies on a take-out order the employee hesitated and then said OK, I'll try.  He goes to the kitchen and asks the cook for some fresh chilies and he got dried chilies for me instead.  I say to the employee I just spent $150 on take-out and you can't give me fresh chilies?  He has this look of \"my hands are tied\"... unbelievable.  I could have asked for chilies added during the cooking of the dishes but I wanted to add the chilies myself so I can control the spiciness.  

Anyhow Salad King, I'm big on customer service so I won't be coming back, and you get to keep your chilies."}
{"text":"Oh, Salad King. You introduced me to Thai food, and I'll always love you for it. Alas, some things must be said: Salad King is good, but not great. Salad King keeps drawing people because (1) it has a great location, and (2) the food is pretty cheap.

The best compliment I could ever give the Salad King is that it is very consistent. I've never had a bad curry at the Salad King, and that alone makes it worth visiting.

I'm gonna echo the sentiment of some of the previous reviewers: the seating arrangement can be very awkward. Don't be surprised to find yourself sitting next to some very loud and obnoxious people. This pretty much ruins the whole dining experience for me. If you don't mind listening in other people's conversations, then by all means, visit the Salad King."}
{"text":"It used to be way better. I came here maybe 3 weeks ago, service is fast but attentive. But I used to like the food taste not anymore. I had the Paid Thai, really traditional Thai dish, a little bit salty for me."}
{"text":"I frequented the original Salad King when I was a student at Ryerson University from 1994 to 1997, and I miss it sorely here in the Pacific Northwest. This restaurant was run by the best mom and pop operation I've ever seen. Ernest, I miss you, and I can't wait to have the best Thai food on earth when I'm back in Toronto next."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and the place was overcrowded, though the waitress was very friendly and the prices' very affordable."}
{"text":"All I have to say is one thing - ISLAMIC NOODLES.

The sole reason I go back is for that dish alone. OMGaaah. Also, I like the vibe of the place - it's artsy and unique. Bonus - it is walking distance from work and if I order ahead I just pickup and run back to the office!!"}
{"text":"Total fan! Chilli customization is a pretty awesome thing. Order the Islamic noodles, those are the most delicious thai fusiony noodley goodness I've ever had in Toronto. Prices are reasonable and the ambience is hip and young but not too pretentious. A very good place to go with friends. However, you do have to be okay sitting and eating next to strangers... usually as long as they aren't having a large and obnoxious or awkward conversation it's not bothersome to your own dinner conversation."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, unbeatable value.

Virtually everything on the menu is great, but the Thai Basil Noodle is my favorite so far. Come with friends and ask for the loyalty card."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening and had the pad thai & panang curry. Pad thai was a little too sour for my taste and the tofu in it tasted a bit off. The panang curry was quite flavourful, though the portion size was on the smaller side. Service is quick and efficient. Very conveniently located. I don't think there's any other decent Thai food in the Eaton Centre area. Communal seating is ok but I wish they had coat racks instead of the bin under the stools. I mean it's nothing to rave about but it'll do the trick if you're craving some Thai food."}
{"text":"Man was this place disappointing. With all these hyped up reviews, I'd thought the food was going to be passable at the very least. I got the golden curry with chicken. There were tiny bits of chicken drenched in watery, bland curry. Horrible. The Seafood fried rice tasted very salty and awful as well. The Islamic Noodles were okay but really not good enough to balance out all the other horrid food we got.

Oh and everyone is cramped like sardines there. Be wary of other very sweaty and smelly customers coming in on a hot day."}
{"text":"Dined at Salad King many years ago.  Decent well portioned  food  with  good service.   Prices are quite good and affordable for many. If you dont mind a tasty meal  in a  communal setting then step inside Salad King with your friends or solo and enjoy a meal .
My recommendation is anything you cannot get elsewhere and is unique to Salad King so you improve  the foodie experience. 
The wait times can be long so keep this in mind if you are in a hurry or have  a lot of time to spend ."}
{"text":"After multiple visits and ordering various things on the menu, the verdict remains the same: mediocre at best. 

The only well branded Thai restaurant in a busy area is bound to get a lot of hype and visitors. But the long wait during lunch and dinner hours is not worth it. 

I've gotten their pad Thai, mango salad, curries (none of which is great) and today I got their veggie lover: spice prince. Which quite honestly is a stir fry of frozen vegetables. I can taste that the vegetables are not fresh and they are soggy in texture. The brown rice is $2 extra which is not really worth it. 

Would not recommend this place for Thai food. 

Would CERTAINLY not recommend this place for two people, esp during rush hours."}
{"text":"Salad King delivers on two counts: cheap and fast. Quality need not apply.

The orange beef lacked beef. And the few pieces that were plated were fried until dry as a bone. The sauce was also pretty watery and bland. At the very least, I know you've got shitloads of cornstarch back there...use it! Don't know where you'd find oranges around these parts though."}
{"text":"one of my favourite places to eat in Toronto! cool atmosphere, love the bench layout. I mostly always eat just two meals (bangkok stir fry or hot thai noodles) and husband likes green curry and some more too, takeout portions are super generous and are ready within 5mins! some servers are really slow with water and sometimes - but rarely - you have to ask for it but in general I love returning here every few months and will miss it when I leave town!"}
{"text":"My favourite Thai joint in Toronto, whenever I'm downtown, I always want to stop by. The service is great and so is the food, the chilli system is my favourite thing as I am a spice lover! Prices are also great for the amount of food you get. 2 meals for roughly $12? I'll take it!"}
{"text":"I get salad king withdrawal symptoms when I dont have SK. The line up is worth the wait. If you dont like spice, order a medium as it can get really spicy. Must try: pattaya chicken and off menu item thai Islamic noodles

Pros: cheap, fast, delicious, large portions 

Cons: there is none"}
{"text":"I Absolutely Love this place! I spent four years at Ryerson and Salad King was my go to choice of food. Atmosphere is great and the place is clean and modern. While I miss the old location (being right across from the Ryerson Campus) where it is now located (on Yonge by the foot locker) it is still pretty easy to find. 

The food is amazing -they have a really goof variety of Thai food and it's delicious, and the prices are great. 

Seriously love this place...the only thing that I would change is the seating. Because Salad King is so popular, its always really busy so if you don't get a  booth you will probably end up at those super long tables ( in which you are sitting on a bench like chair-no back support) or in the front. I just wished they had more space to accommodate more room for your party so you are not so close to other people/tables."}
{"text":"I really like the different types of pad thai here, and the price is good.  One of downsides are the long bench-like tables they try to make you sit at.  I usually ask them to sit somewhere else because I really don't want to sit next to a random person and hear their conversation while eating my meal with friends.  So far in my multiple visits, I've always had a good experience here and would recommend it to anyone wanting to have some good and cheap thai food."}
{"text":"This place is in the perfect location right near the eaton centre and ryerson university making it my go to anytime I'm downtown! 

The portions are quite large and the service is quick, you can easily be in and out in 45min. I usually go for their flavourful shrimp pad Thai even though it's a little on the dry side. Do not order the wine, it's worse than boxed wine! Their mild has a little kick so opt for that if you're not very comfortable with spice."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch here today. Nice place inside. The menu is easy to read (it's basically your placemat) and the server was on point. She was really friendly and gave us a good selection of the top dishes. We went with panang chicken (one of my favs) and phud thai with panang sauce. We were happy with both dishes. The portion size was more than expected too. I would love to come back and try something new! The only reason I didn't give a 5 star was because I asked if it would be spicy and I was told no but it was still too spicy for me! But that's just because I like no spice in my food. Personal preference =)"}
{"text":"Finally got the Islamic Noodles ($11) with two chilis. Reminds me of laksa soup; if you feel under the weather, I'd recommend this in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"In the past year I haven't had a five star experience at Salad King so I have to revoke my previous rating. This past Saturday the rice was unspeakably bad. How can a Thai restaurant not know how to steam a pot of rice?? I can't look past that, regardless of the rest of my meal. 

I've got other Thai options up my sleeve for future cravings now (Golden Thai, Sukho Thai, etc.). 

Also, still unacceptably closed on Sundays and only open till 9pm other nights."}
{"text":"Salad king was the best! They now raised the prices between $1- $2 that it is changing from affordable for students to on the higher end of fast Thai food. The serving sizes definitely decreased usually my staple is the Thai fried rice but now it looks 3/4 of what it usually is and definitely less ingredients! 

I would recommend the mango sticky rice which also went up to now $4! It used to be $2.50! 

This is still an option but there are much better restaurants in the area that cost less.

On the bright side because of the increase, it is much easier to find seats and the noise has definitely been reduced."}
{"text":"Finally! The return of salad king!
My party of 3 luckily arrived rather early, and got ahead of the lunch crowd and avoided a lengthy wait.
The food was still delicious, with reasonable portion sizes that will leave you stuffed. However, my curry wasn't as spicy as I remembered it to be, but maybe next time I just need to kick it up a notch in the spicy scale. The Thai Islamic Noodle was as good as I remembered it to be.
On the other side, the food was slow. We waited quite awhile for the food, and my order came a lot later than my friends'."}
{"text":"Hardly anything could be made truly vegetarian, i.e. without fish sauce or oyster sauce (even food on their 'vegetarian' section of the menu uses fish sauce). 

Service was horrible and horribly slow - no one to take orders, they will bring out a large plate but no serving spoon, no one around for water refills, etc."}
{"text":"I went with a large group and it was pretty good. The waiter was really nice and customized one of my friend's order (she was vegetarian). The food came pretty quickly and tasted prett good. I got the standard Phu Thai with tofu. The portion size was also good too.

The place isn't that big but it was a good place for groups to gather. Its also located in a really good location.

Overall, I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Not a place to linger or for atmosphere but the authenticity, price and quality of the food make it a great spot on the go or before heading out for the night.

I wish they had kept the more formal restaurant upstairs at the old location.  They moved it into a strip mall north of the city which is disappointing. It had been a great mix of incredible food and experience.  

To the owners - bring back a more formal option to downtown.  If you could do it while bring lobster lychee back to the menu all the better!"}
{"text":"I've been in the city less than 6 months, and I've been to this place more than 6 times. That's pretty crazy, for my standards.

Food here is really good. I wouldn't say that it is Khao San Road good (that is still my favorite) - but the food at Salad king is delicious. I've tried everything on their menu - from the golden curry to the islamic noodles. I will say that they won't disappoint! If you want to go to a nice place with delicious Thai food with less than 15-20 minute wait - go to salad king!!! No crazy lineups (and even if there are people waiting, the pace is like Tim Hortons - you'll be seated in less than 15-20 minutes).

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Salad King, it's a staple for a good reason.  Here's my top 7 reasons. =)

1) It's fast
2) It's cheap
3) It's consistent (and I mean consistently good)
4) It's conveniently located (no better asian food around yonge and dundas)
5) It has become a scale for how spicy foods are.  (Ex., going out for wings, how spicy are these, would you say it's like a 5 or a 10 at salad king?
6) First time when my friend asked me to go to Salad King (talking about 10 years ago), I wanted to say no.  Cause who wants to go to a reso which serves salad for dinner.  Thank goodness, they served much more than just salad.  Good memories
7) In Seven words for reason 7, \"Order off secret menu - Thai Islamic Noodles\""}
{"text":"The food was cheap, but nothing special.  If this place doesn't re-open, I wouldn't be all that upset."}
{"text":"Inconsistent spiciness, poor service, and loud/crowded.

If you're looking for fast, friendly Thai food, look elsewhere.

It's not ALWAYS bad here, since I've had positive experiences here sometimes, but then other times just make you regret returning.

My worst (and last) visit to the place involved getting a \"mild\" fried rice. It ended up being so hot I could not finish even 20% of the plate! It's not that I can't handle spicy food, since I've had their 10 chili dishes before, but it was horrible that the \"mild\" that I specifically asked for was even hotter than 10-chili.

I asked the waitress if my order was correct, and the answer was \"well, the chefs are not consistent\", and did not even offer to prepare a new plate (heck, I would have been happy with getting a bowl of white rice just to dilute the fried rice down).

So no, don't go to Salad King any more. I used to be good sometimes, not anymore."}
{"text":"Salad King is a bright, bustling spot in the Yonge-Dundas area and while it serves up some tasty Thai food, it probably isn't the place for you if you're a food snob as it's not the most authentic. However, I've enjoyed everything I've tried here and usually go for the Islamic noodles (secret menu item!) which is their hot Thai noodles with curry. It's rich, delicious and super filling. Service is consistently fast and friendly, and I like that you can choose your spice level.

Keep in mind that they don't take dinner reservations and only take large group reservations for lunch!"}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful. Fun decor. Fast, delicious food which for the price, can't be beat. Islamic noodles are amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely great Thai food for the price, very cheap and extremely fast! The Servers are personable and friendly. 

The only downfall of this Salad King is the seating and the noise level. You can be seated next to several others and it can become loud and very squishy. It's very hard to get room for your jackets and coats (especially in the winter time!) There is just no room for winter gear. The cubbies underneath the seats aren't enough."}
{"text":"Was in town and stopped for some Thai. The food was delicious but service was sooo slow. I thought I could have flown back to NYC and back to Toronto before the server attended to us. Understanding they may have been short staffed but still there should still be some acknowledgement for the delay. Once our food finally came out, there was a piece of plastic in my brothers dish. The server called the manager out who was apologetic and made a new dish for my brother. They removed that from the bill which was good. Still the service was unfortunate and the plastic in the food are the reason for the stars deduction.

Was fairly easy to get a table for 4 on a Sat afternoon."}
{"text":"Street Soup Noodle: 3/5 Soup base is a Tom Yum soups base a little too sour for my taste. It was a decent dish. 

Thai Basil Noodle: 3/5 Nothing in particular, lacking a little salt in my opinion. 

Portion size is a little to the smaller size. 

Customer Service: 1/5 Maybe my friends and I went at the wrong time. But it seems like the restaurant was understaffed. ( many bus boys/ girls, but not enough servers and waiters). When the food finally came the server asked if we wanted some plates to share our food. We said YES. But she forgot, so I asked 2 different bus boy and bus girl to get some plates for us. 1 said he'll get our server... the other didn't even reply ( the restaurant was really busy, however it's just getting plates, not no one wants to do it) so I went over to the small room where they store takeout boxes and took 3 styrofoam takeout boxes myself to use. 

Overall experience: 1.5/5 Food was decent, can't complain since it was super busy. However the customer  service was really lacking. Nothing to hype over about."}
{"text":"King? More like Jack Prince.

This isn't the most authentic Thai in town, and since the post-fire revamp it's hyper-touristy and modernly decorated, but It's still a-ok with me. I have an affinity towards dives normally, but I do enjoy their clean approach to cafeteria style. The neon elephant decor always makes me crack a smile, too. 

I usually go for the Thai hot and sour and their seafood fried rice. Both are decent. Everyone else goes nuts for their green curry, but I find it a bit sweet. 

PEPPER POINTS: For their easy to use chili system. Be warned... five is hot!"}
{"text":"I went and ordered the pad thai - it was quite tasty. Unfortunately I'm very allergic to eggs - I pointed this out to my server, who then proceeded to serve me pad thai with egg. I ate half of the dish before I spotted the egg - even when I pointed it out he said that it was \"impossible\". They brought me another dish (egg free) and then charged me for it. I spoke to the manager to try and get the charge removed, but he said that it was \"impossible\". When I didn't leave a tip, the server asked me what was wrong with my meal. 

Terrible service, no respect to allergies whatsoever."}
{"text":"Mango salad was fresh and had lots of mango shreds.  I think it had three litttle pieces of cabbage.  Basically, it is a plate of a mango shredded.  It was ok.

What go me going was the islamic noodle with 10 chilli - a superb noodle dish.  It is a pad thai drenched in spicy cocconut sauce with lots of subtle ingredients.  It is food that looks so so (grey overall color) but becomes an art in your mouth and punches you out while it goes down your throat - and you want more.  And it is not even in the menu - why!  Holy name should be associated with holy food.

I took a star off because of the uncomfortable seating and loud noise.  It felt like food court."}
{"text":"Salad King is a downtown staple. I've spent my fair share downtown and when I need my pad Thai fix, salad King is there for me. 

Prices are fair for portion and quality. Also it's a fairly big space which is good considering this place's popularity. Not everyone is a fan of the cafeteria-style sitting on long tables and benches. So if you value your personal space, this might not be your style. I don't mind, since the service and food come prompt and I know I can be in and out rather quickly. 

Bonus points for them having some serious spice skills and options for anyone from mild to downright suicidal level spice!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite Thai place. Excellent quality,  amazing value for money and selection.  Dont bother going during peak hours because its always packed. But a perfect date spots when its quiet."}
{"text":"Simply awesome.  I'm by no means a \"foodie,\" but after many Torontonians suggested it, we wound up here and I make it a stop every time I'm in town!   The food ranges form mild to wild - you can choose how many peppers you'd like in your meal (I'm still learning to survive in the two pepper range!), and have discovered some amazingly delish dishes (Pineapple fried rice - YUM! And don't forget to try the mango sticky rice!).   I'm only ever eaten downstairs which is the less formal dining space - you sit at tables that are llike Asian cafeteria tables.  Upstairs is more formal.  Price is pretty cheap - lots of nearby Ryerson students love this place for that reason!  Reservations are a must!  If you drop in, the wait could be 45 minutes or longer on the weekend... which just speaks to this place's greatness!  I'm salivating just thinking about it... SALAD KING, I love you!"}
{"text":"I tried the Orange Beef this visit.  Its a lot different than a Chinese orange beef.  There is a light broth underneath the fried beef and topped with thin slices of cooked peppers an onions.  Its lighter in flavour but you taste some orange.  The service was super quick which is nice at lunch time."}
{"text":"I ordered a Pud Thai - medium spicy... the noodle came out very pale, dry and tasteless. I have had pud thai at many other restaurants in Toronto before and this can be the worst by far... on the other hand, Islamic noodle was really good, enjoyed the coconut creamy taste."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never heard of this place before! I went here on a Friday with some friends. We got here around 8pm and boy it was hella busy. We only had to wait for about 5-10 minutes before we were seated so it wasn't so bad.

The price wasn't bad for what I got, which was the Islamic noodles (not on the menu) and it was delicious. Our food came out maybe 10-15 minutes later which was fabulous because we were all starving. A tad too saucy though which did hinder the experience for me. My friend got the Thai Basil Noodles and they were delicious as well! We also got a beer tower which definitely got us in the mood for our Halloween activities later that evening. 

Our waiter was super friendly and amazing, great service filled our waters just the right amount of times. I do recommend going to this place for tasty, decently sized and priced Thai food."}
{"text":"I loved this place when i lived in Toronto and definitely a place i visit when in town.  I LOVE the islamic noodles and miss them so much at times, green and panang curry are great as well.  All this talk i may have to book a flight here soon!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here.  The only thing that somewhat bothers me is the communcal seating which reminds me of eating in mess halls during my university days.

My go-to's at Salad King are the Bangkok Stir-fry and the Mango sticky-rice (dessert)"}
{"text":"Salad King - the reason why my 'freshman 15' didn't kick in until my 2nd year at Ryerson. Throughout my freshman year, I thought Salad King was a salad store in the Eaton's Centre food court. Imagine my surprise when I finally decided to join my friends for dinner here one day. 1. It was never located in the Eaton's Centre. 2. Their specialty lies in Thai Food, NOT salads. 

I'm pretty sure I tried every single item on their menu, with the old location (before the fire) being located conveniently close to all my lecture halls. Since graduating and it's move to the new location, I haven't visited Salad King much. But one this is for certain, the food still tastes great! 

I'm always a sucker for the Islamic Noodles. If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend! Imagine Pad Thai meets Coconut Curry Sauce + wholesome nutty flavour heaven. That's what you'll get when you order the Islamic Noodles."}
{"text":"This place is definitely alright.  Came from lunch with a co-worker.  You walk way upstairs, and you are seating in almost group type fashion.  There are long table with stools lining both sides.  So, you are seated at a location, but then another couple just sat right beside us.  It is nice inside, but very cool with this seating setup.  
The food was good... spicy, good size portion, service was fast and efficient.  My co-worker ordered off the \"Secret Menu?\"... Thai Islamic Style Noodles.  I must admit.. it was better than what I ordered.  It was so good, other people in the restaurant came up and asked him what he ordered just based on the smell.  Price was reasonable.  This is a good place to come for lunch.  Recommended.  I will probably come back.  Didn't knock my socks off... but was A-OK."}
{"text":"Salad King is great! so many dishes to choose from.

My favourite is the Seafood Fried Rice, Bangkok Stir Fry & their new dish that I think that's not even on the menu yet, Khao Soi, which is basically egg noodles in curry soup. I love spicy food and I usually get 15-20 chilis. I love how they have a certain degree of hotness that you get to choose from, because for some people it's kind of hard to say how spicy you want your food. I personally love extremely spicy food, so for me it's never a problem, I just get the highest.
I like the Panang Curry and Green Curry as well.
Not crazy about the Pad Thai, it's a bit too sweet for my liking, but still alright. They also have Thai Islamic Noodle, which isn't on the menu, that's pretty good too.
Their portion is huuuuuge. It's more like 2 meals in 1 for me. I sometimes take half to go. They taste just as good microwaved the next day. 

For appetizers, I like the mini-shrimp rolls, spring rolls or Mango Salad. Their Tom Yum Goong is not bad either.

For dessert, I like the Mango Sticky Rice. yumm.

I've eaten at Salad King numerous times I don't even know. Ever since I was a student and until now. I was so glad when they opened their new location, because when they closed down the old location, my friends and I felt like we couldn't find other spicy-food place around that's good enough. I got so many of my friends and coworkers addicted after I brought them there. So obsessed they had to order take-out and actually have someone to cab it there to pick it up so they can eat it at work. Too bad they don't do delivery. I'd get it all the time.

The place is cafeteria style, so if there's only 2 of you, you'd most likely be seated at one of the long tables, beside strangers. If there's about 4 or more people, you might get one of the regular tables or booths.

Fast and great service. Washrooms pretty decent.

Price range is pretty cheap. Entrees are like $9-11, depending if you get them with Chicken, Beef or Shrimp. Shrimp being the highest.

Overall, I think it's a great restaurant that will satisfy your craving for Thai food (although it's not exactly authentic)."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the new location and it was great. I hadn't been there in about 5 years but now I plan to go more often.  We were a group of four on a Friday night and only ended up waiting about 15 Minutes for our table.  The atmosphere is pleasant,  although it can get a little loud.  We had no issues at all with the service, if anything they were very polite and accommodating.   The food didn't take too long to reach our table and it was delicious and plentiful.  We also found it to be very affordable. I can't remember the name of my dish but I will post some pictures later."}
