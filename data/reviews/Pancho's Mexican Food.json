{"text":"Good LA style Mexican food. Their daily specials are great. Tuesday is my favorite, street style carne asada tacos. The owners didn't want to pay Roberto's the franchise fee any longer. Not much changed besides the name. Menu is similar."}
{"text":"Personally I believe this location is the best at hygiene from the moment you walk in you realize how clean there floor is as well as their counters and tables, yes they might not salad bar anymore, bummer but they still serve green and red salsa when you receive your order and they don't limit you its just more hygienic. The whole facility is well taken care. 

The food is made fresh when ordered and have a lot on their menu to pick from it very tasty. I really like texture of their meat its not like bitting into gum like I've experienced in other places before and its seasoned properly.   

Its still owned by the same people they just had a name change it said it in the entrance the people are very friendly. i constantly see the same employees they had at Robertos still working there."}
{"text":"Even after there change from Robert's to Panchos I still feel it's the best Mexican food ever.! I can't get enough of there carne asada fries. There fries cooked till golden. There made fresh guacamole is very delicious. And the fresh ingredients they us to make the pico de gallo. The carne asada cooked just right as well. Very juicy and flavorful. They have a great variety on there menu for anyone who has a liking to something specific. There mexican food is still the best."}
{"text":"No spices on meat, meat tasted old, high prices,  extra charge for using debit card  will not go back"}
{"text":"Going downhill. New owners = higher prices, smaller portions, and got rid of the salsa bar. Now when u ask for salsa they give u a tiny container that is maybe half full. They also close early now. Just drive a little further to Roberto's."}
{"text":"The food was very mediocre and wasn't what I expected. The carne asada was very dry and not flavorful at all I've had better tacos from other places."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Used to be a Robertos. How can my carne asada burrito and quesadilla take 2 minutes and weigh as much as a bag of feathers? That is nothing compared to the taste which the freezer section at your local grocer could provide better results. Won't be going back. Save your $$$."}
{"text":"I am a regular that comes here and they never mess up my order. Hands down better than Roberto's or anything along those taco shop chains. The best thing to order is a breakfast burrito with bacon and potatoes. For roughly $5 it is worth the purchase and definitely underrated for the quality of the food. The customer service is above and beyond, I pay with card and the lady who works there always bypasses the tip option even though I would certainly leave a tip if she didn't and if I carried cash haha. I love coming here and it hits the spot every single time. I haven't explored the menu outside of breakfast burritos and carne asada fries. But for them to get it spot on every single time is an excellent job. The place is always clean and well stocked. Not a lot of traffic when I go to order but it's still excellent all around and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Thank you Panchos for always hitting the spot."}
{"text":"Amazing service Daniel the bartender was the BOMB!  Great food and incredible margaritas.  Great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Used to be a Roberto's chain. Same food, different hours. Quality is about the same if not better, don't expect the best Mexican food you'll ever have but a great spot that won't break the bank for decent food. Employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"What terrible service. I sat at the bar for 10 minutes with zero service at the summerlin location, nobody to be found, so I left. If you want real good Mexican food and amazing service then go to Juans Fajitas"}
{"text":"the food is still the same.  The only thing i can complain about it not being able to get your salsa and stuff anymore.  My family really loves the salsa and we loved that we could get our own.    That was always one of the best things about robertos."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been in business for more than 15 years. The only thing that has changed is the name, but everything even the owner is the same. Honestly I don't see why people complain about the salsa, I asked why they already have it ready and they said kids would play with the salad bar or people would just come in and get salsa without buying anything. It's for customers only and I get that. Besides all you have to do is tell them how many you want and they give them to you. Another thing is that is restaurant is extremely clean compared to other Roberto's. What I love the most is the new items they added to their menu and 99 cent tacos on Tuesday's and Wednesday's. The service is great and my food is always amazing. They are still in business for a reason. Totally recommend!!"}
{"text":"I was hoping when Pancho's replaced the Roberto's at this location it would be an upgrade, but was sorely disappointed. I'm sad to report that the burrito I ordered for take-out was probably the worst I've ever had. The burrito was cold, the tortilla was flaky in a stale kind of way, and my order was incorrect. I asked for french fries in my veggie burrito, but there was none to found. Instead, there was pico in my burrito, which I did not ask for. In the description of the veggie burrito, there is no mention of pico de gallo being added. Whose bright idea was it to pour onion laden pico in my cold burrito?? I was starved but couldn't get past the half-point in my burrito because I was so dissatisfied with the taste. I opted for leftover take-out pizza in my fridge instead! 

Unlike Roberto's, Pancho's does not have a salsa bar. An option of red and green salsa are provided when your order is handed to you at the counter. My burrito and a small drink set me back $7.36. There's a $0.50 charge to use a debit card and a $1 charge for using credit. It's painfully small inside, so I would recommend take-out only. The only positive thing I can say is that my order took about 4 minutes to make. Because my experience was a fantastic failure, I will not be coming back.

{"text":"Great food , great service , and excellent decor .  The mole sauce was fantastic , the fajitas were sizzling , and everyone was friendly .  It was a Monday night and they did not have any entertainment as advertised on their website , but it was still nice ."}
{"text":"Good food,prices and nice owners ask for the gordo gringo 2 eggs over a chicken enchiladas plate my favorite"}
{"text":"The food use to be good, when it was robertos, the tortillas are soggy and rubbery, the carne asada is always dry and no flavor.  It's a shame they can't get basic Mexican food to taste good"}
{"text":"Bring back Roberto's! The food is gross! How do you mess up chicken tacos? The oil that they used to deep fry the tacos was definitely way over used. Dirty oily rubbery tacos... just go next door and get a hot n fresh to go pizza from Little Caesars."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 tacos, one carne asada and two carnitas. It took a little while, which I was ok thinking my meat was being cooked. When I stepped closer to look at the cooking operations I noticed was cubed meat being reheated on a grill. I was hoping that was not my meat. Carnitas is a juicy shredded texture with a delicious distinct flavor. If you're looking for that don't come here. 

When I got home and looked at the 3 tacos I couldn't decipher the meats, both had a grayish color with no flavor to identify the two besides being dry as hell. The food was cold and it was 108 temp outside. The meat had no smell, I couldn't taste the difference.
The taco meat was obviously pre cooked by who knows how many hours or days. The carnitas are definitely a pre cooked dry pork chop chopped in hard cubes with zero flavoring. The stake was bland too. I will say there was not a drop of grease from the tacos but then again dry pre cooked meat would do that too. 

The tacos are single wrapped tortilla which sucked cause I had to put a ton of sauce to get it down however the sauce soaked the tortilla and it tore. 

I couldn't finish it no matter how much hot sauce helped. It was inedible and pretty pricey at under $10 bucks for 3 tacos with a $.50 charge for debt card use. This place has not salsa bar. You have to ask for red and green sauce. 

SKIP IT. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND THE HEADACHE!"}
{"text":"Pancho's excels and beat competitors like Roberto's and Tacos el Gordo. The meat almost melts in your mouth, and the servings are GINORMOUS. Last night I got the carne asada fries, and I could hardly finish it. Now you may be thinking \"maybe his definition of big is my definition is small\", but this isn't the case. The to-go box was literally filled to the lid with food. I couldn't close the box properly, there was that much. I look forward to going again and trying more items."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around this area. Better than Robertos and company. The bean and cheese burrito or beef rolled tacos with guacamole and sour cream are the best items. Rice is a little salty but I love it.  Walked in twice at 11 before they close and the food is steaming hot and super fresh!"}
