{"text":"I ordered delivery from Campus Biryani, and it's been two hours and counting.  All I ordered was falafel and samosas.  I won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Worst service in madison. Staff are rude. Ordered take out and was over 30 minutes late. Brought the wrong order and what they brought was less than average."}
{"text":"Wow, pretty terrible.  The bits of chicken were totally dry - really gross.  I'd never order there again."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars that would be generous.  Food is not cheap- they advertise food they don't have.  Service is horrible.  Don't support this place.  It should be replaced by a real restaurant"}
{"text":"I've been looking over the reviews of Campus Biryani & Gyros after my experience tonight, and have seen a pretty broad spread of comments-mostly leaning negative. I want to start by saying, contrary to numerous comments, I found the staff to be quite friendly and attentive, so that is the plus I want to give up front in this review.  However, on other points, my impressions were similar (notably the lack of cleanliness and dirty containers laying around with nobody there).  Tonight was my first experience at this place, and I am pretty familiar with various Mediterranean and Indian food, so I feel justified to say I was less than impressed.  I ordered the Greek Salad ($7.25) and Jumbo Falafel Plate ($9.99). For the falafel plate, it was supposed to come with a vegetarian mix, tomato, onions, parsley, pita, and tahini sauce.  What I received was a decent portion of uniform small falafels in foil, and on the side, a small proportion ( a small cup) of cut spring mix salad with a few pieces of onion and tomato and flakes of parsley.  Strangely, it came with a single small serving of tzatziki sauce (why?) and what appeared to be a tablespoon of hummus-no tahini as expected.  Considering I purchased the \"jumbo\", I would have hoped for at least two small containers of each or better yet, two single containers of actual tahini as advertised as while tzatziki may be good with gyros, it doesn't work well with falafel.  Furthermore, I requested on the side as an add-on the Nan bread, and never received it (just two pitas).  The Greek salad was unremarkable (and regrettably served with a small serving of balsamic vinegarette rather than greek dressing). For $7.25, it would have been nice to have a more diverse and flavorful dish beyond, again, spring mix greens, three slices of cucumber, a few pieces of tomato, literally five small canned olive pieces (NOT kalamata olives, but your standard black), and feta.  I gave this review 2 stars rather than 1 since it's my first visit and I didn't go back to complain and give them the chance to correct my order.  But then again, I shouldn't have to ask to be served what is advertised, right?  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"So I had called for delivery! They're so rude and took forever to make the food! I recommend to not order from here! They're so rude and even had the nerve to call back and tell me to never order from there anymore, due to the fact I canceled it because it took more than 2 hours to get here! I was so mad and felt very disrespected from the call! If anything they should've apology and try to work something out with a customer, but they're too ignorant to acknowledge about customer service!"}
{"text":"Ready for a story?  I ordered lunch online the other day from here through 24hours.com, linked from their website. The site said my address was outside their delivery area despite it being 2 miles away. Worked with 24hours.com tech support to get my order placed, they had me submit it as a carryout order then they changed it in their system. Campus Biryani then called and said they don't have any of one of the Indian items I ordered and sent some kind of Greek one instead. Fine, whatever. I'm hungry. Website said 45-60 minutes.  80 minutes later, I get a call from the delivery driver. He wants me to go downstairs and meet him in front of the building because he \"doesn't have time\" to bring it to the 4th floor as indicated on the directions. He says he will be there in one minute so I rush outside and wait for him.  6 minutes later, the driver finally shows up. Of course, this is now around 85 minutes since I placed the order and now I have to rush to a meeting in 3 minutes. By the time I finally got to eat my lunch, it was cold and wasn't that good anyway.  Never again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered take out from Campus Biryani last night and found the food to be the worst restaurant food we've had in 2 years of living in Madison. Neither of the Indian curry dishes even remotely represented curry. The vegetables in the vegetarian dish had definitely been frozen and did not taste remotely fresh. The curry sauce resembled lumpy, sewer brown cafeteria gravy. The beef dish was not much better. The beef was tender, which was nice, but the flavor was more like a boring Midwest pot roast than any Indian dish I've ever had. Apparently they're not very familiar with Indian spices because we couldn't really taste them in either dish. I ended up dipping my naan in my own olive oil and spices from home, neglecting the other dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered from here online and waited for an hour and 15 minutes. Called them up to see what was taking so long and said it would be there shortly, after seeking clarification he said the order hadn't even gone out yet. I told him to cancel the order and he tried to tell me I was an unreasonable person who didn't understand how restaurants work. Apparently wait times aren't really a factor in the restaurant business like I had been previously led to believe."}
{"text":"This place is kind of scary. It was so dirty I'm hoping I don't get sick because, in spite of appearances, we ate there anyway. I got veg biryani which was beautufully spiced. Quite spicy though, so I asked for a raita and was given a thick, sourcream-like cucumber sauce. The two together were delicious. Tasted my hubby's samosa- tough crust and strange flavor, but he liked it. No cold water available. Had to ask the guy to clean off a table for us. Place was empty and no clean tables. Don't even look over the counter into the kitchen - a disgrace. Whole place needs cleaning! Too bad, the food is really good, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I've given this place three shots as I regularly work and go to class just a few blocks away.  Each time I was disappointed.  In all three cases, the rice was not fresh and the main disk was lukewarm.  If you want a good laugh, order the Chicken Tikka Masala.  Best of all, the owner will blow you off until you actively try to order."}
{"text":"The delivery took about an hour, which was longer than advertised but the food was fantastic.  I ordered the lamb kabob, it was delicious.  Thankfully I didn't read these before I ordered."}
{"text":"Having just ordered for delivery, I can safely say, the service from this place is terrible. I ordered from them over an hour ago and called to see if there was a problem with the order. The guy who picked up VERY rudely demanded what my address was, and when I didn't understand what he had said, he promptly just barked \"WHAT ADDRESS\" into the phone. He then proceeded to let me know it would take another 15-20mins, making the total delivery time 2 hours, which is over two times longer than their original claim.  The guy then, without anything else to say, just hung up!  At this point, regardless of what their food is like, I will no longer be ordering from or eating here ever again. This was only my first experience with them and I already regret it. Definitely not worth being treated like S***."}
{"text":"The food was horrific. The chicken curry was bland and just plain inedible. Then it was delivered to me in paper Chinese to go box that leaked all over the place. Waste of time... Pick a different restaurant"}
{"text":"Pure disgusting, I ordered off grub hub said it would be an hour then finally 3 hours later after 2 several attempts to call, the driver who was the cook, owner, cashier and whatever else said he sent the driver out 20 mins ago, then the same person called back and said he would be to my location in 30 mins. I'm assuming this is gonna be some good food because I waited an eternity for it. The same person I was on the phone with delivered and said he didn't need a tip, (considering the fact I already gave a tip on grub hub is the only reason why I pay cash for a tip now) i just shook my head.   Now I ordered a gyro, two at that, some calamari, cheese fries, soda, and I got some dessert for free ... that gyro was cold and hard, cheese was a small container, fries was cold, calamari was cold, and the soda was hot. The food made me sick.    Bottom line this place is nasty, when you see that they are open on every place that has delivery service it's a reason why they are open."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon. A man, who was likely the owner was running the place. I'm a sucker for hole in the wall authentic food. This place fits the bill. However when we were there, it was FILTHY. There had been people in the place previously, but I couldn't tell if it was the day we were there or last week. The gyros come off the spit, the rice is good. The place is unsanitary as a place could be and still be functional. Not only was the dining area a disaster, but so was the area where food is prepared. The floor was filthy, the tables were crusty, the salt shaker was coated in dirt, there were chairs misplaced, lightbulbs were missing. I expected tortillas food poisoning and I didn't. I'm shocked. I think if the owners just kept the place clean, they'd have a legit, thriving business. After all, who doesn't love an authentic falafel sandwich or a gyro?"}
{"text":"You know, I have decided that despite their Gyros not being as good as most places in Madison they are still pretty decent for a place who will deliver.......oh wait.....  So, since my order was cancelled on grub hub they will not let me review them on grubhub so....welcome to yelp again Robert!!!!!   So, I am sitting here in my office and really have no desire to go and get some food so I hop on the wonderful interwebs and boo....lets order some food.  Pizza....nah.  Subs....nah. Gyros.....YEAH!    Awesome and will be here in a hour....perfect.  25 Minutes later my phone rings and it is somebody from Campus whatever telling me they are canceling my order because they are too busy.  Thats it....no sorry, no real reason, just cancelled.    Ummm, so why are you on grubhub then?   Also why did it take you 20-25 minutes to tell me this.    I have had your Gyros before and they are nothing special....at all!    Pizza Pit has better Gyros and that.....that is saying a lot.   How about this.....go on your grubhub page and update your account.  I will write it for you....  \"We make sub-par gyros and accept order all around Madison but in reality we will not deliver to you.\"      Perfect....thanks!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery the other night after spotting a decent deal on BadgerBites -- buy one item on the menu, get the other half off. After nearly TWO hours of waiting, my delivery man arrived. As always, he brought with him CB's surly, unfriendly, fuck-off attitude (for some reason the employees here have a serious attitude problem). Anyway, the food was just as disappointing as the service. A lamb gyro consisted of only meat and a few sparse tomatoes. No lettuce, hardly any Tahini sauce, and poor proportions. My falafel sandwich was a joke -- falafel had the consistency of wallpaper mixed with cornmeal, and almost no flavor. I couldn't detect any sauce whatsoever, and the pita tasted days old.  Save your money and don't order from Campus Biryani."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience! For the deliver man to call me and keep hugging and puffing because I didn't want to come down to his car!? What the heck!? Are you kidding me!? Then you keep me on the phone for 3 minutes while you drive up park and very slowly make your way to my building while making me reappear myself over and over and over....yup! Never again! First and only time ever!!! Plant of good places to get a Gyro and from the reviews I have read this place really has no place being open.   -15 yr restaurant career under my belt"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly! Very fast service for delivery and even put in a free chocolate cake and free sauces! Food was actually really good! We got classic gyro sandwiches and the gyro platter-really great quality, fresh, and very yummy!"}
{"text":"I would have rated something lower than 1 star, if I had a choice. This kind of restaurants should be shutdown. I ordered biriyani. I am an Indian. It was not biriyani at all. The chicken pieces were gross. At least 5 days old. I feel lucky I am alive after tasting couple of spoons. I threw the entire thing."}
{"text":"Food is delicious.  I had the vegetable biryani.  My daughter had salmon and rice.  My other daughter had a gyro.  The food was absolutely delicious.  I just wish that the place was a bit cleaner.  But the food was absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place about 8:00 on Saturday Night. There was a Gyro special listed outside for $5.99 and we were planning on getting Gyro's as it was so we were excited. We come in to a very unwelcoming, dingy dining area with an order counter in the back. The TV was on to some awful news station, and was clearly turned up so the person working could hear it. We could hear little else. Two other students were standing there and a laptop was plugged into the ceiling. Not a great start.  After waiting close to 5 minutes at the counter - guessing that the cook was the only one there and that he must be working on the two students order - he finally came over to see us. To say the guy working had a bad attitude is being kind. We told him we wanted the $5.99 Gyro special and a couple of fries. Should have been $16 dollars - he proceeded to charge us $18+ for the Gyro and fries listed on the menu. I told him we wanted the special and he just argued with us. Between his accent and the loud TV, I could barely make out what he was saying - except that the fact that he was going to over charge us if we wanted Gyros and fries. Based on his business and atmosphere, we were guessing we could be his last customer and just paid the extra $2. By this point, I just wanted to leave.   I'm not sure really how this place is in business. Most people wouldn't stay after walking in and the long wait to order. Being overcharged and argued with would have turned away anyone who made it that far. I do have to say that the Gyro wasn't too bad tasting though. The fries were a bit over done but not terrible.  I can't say we will ever go back. . . one star is for not getting sick from eating the food."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Staff is very rude. I ordered online only to find out they added more than I ordered because \"they would be losing money to deliver to me.\" Luckily GrubHub called to verify the addition.   After a shouting match with the manager (who told me it was too late to cancel my order) I got my way and he cancelled my order (begrudgingly)  and told him i would never eat there again.  I'd give this place 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"While the restaurant wAs small and not the cleanest, the food was fantastic and the gentleman that was working (I believe he owns it) was overly accommodating ,fast, and even gave me free dessert. I had a really pleasant experience and will come back whenever I want a gyro or a Greek salad. Seriously, if you can get over that it is a little hole the wall, your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"I notice that some reviews have negative opinions about the food, but thought I'll throw in my two-cents.  We went for dinner after a long lab day. It's kinda self-serve, but food is definitely cooked fresh.  This seems to be home style cooking; it's not greasy, saucy or salty. (All that is characteristic of Asian food in US) Lamb kabob is cooked just right and you can taste the lamb. Rice is pleasantly dry. The vegetable marsala has good mix and good portion of vegie with light tasting curry sauce. It suits the lightly seasoned rice well. You can taste the quality of the ingredients.  One thing to keep in mind is that if you're used to saucy Indian food, you might think the flavoring here is too toned down. But if you're looking for a light fare, this should work out well."}
{"text":"Would get cheap gyros here when I lived down the block (Gyros and board games...yum). I think they've since upped the price. I always enjoyed it well enough. It's not the nicest place, but I was never uncomfortable waiting for our gyros to finish."}
{"text":"This food is gross! I ordered vegetable korma and a shrimp dish, and I ended up with vegetable biryani because they didn't have any korma. The shrimp and the biryani were both so disappointing. The only thing I really ended up eating were the fries (which I admit were good), but the rest of the food will sit in my fridge until I am really desperately starving with no other food in the house. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"The worst food ever also the service is terrible  I will never order there again  Everything is over-spiced and over cooked not fresh ! I wish I could give this place -5 stars"}
{"text":"The guy who owns this place has a real bad attitude and it equates to bad service and a negative feel.  The gyros here, for lack of another word suck.  The lamb is terrible and that's what makes the gyro.  The sauce on it is decent but nothing special, and you can't really screw up tomatoes and onions so no credit for those."}
{"text":"Horrible. Can I give this zero stars ?  Nasty food. I ate 2 bites of my lamb biryani that took 10 mins to warm up and was steaming hot! I couldn't even eat it. The lamb piece was in the middle of the rice and it tasted horrible. Never ever go to a place with yelp reviews that are bad! Save your money. I politely asked for a box, put it all in, paid, walked out and threw it into the trash can at the corner."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. My boyfriend and I were so excited to order curry from here. It took forever to get to our place and... I don't even know if I can describe what was in the bag. But I'm going to try. Our respective curries were essentially dirty water with some pieces of old brown meet floating around in them (along with a few raw carrots. My boyfriend thinks his meat was spoiled. The \"curry\" we received looked like toilet water and  tasted like toilet water. There was nothing curry-like about it. AND It was also expensive. Additionally, we got a free mango lassee with our order - and that was EXTREMELY watered down too. All of it was watered down and too gross to eat so we had to throw everything out. I HIGHLY recommend against this place."}
{"text":"Extremely rude and offputting staff. It got to the point where my girlfriend decided we should cancel our order and leave because we weren't sure if this is what the owner wanted from us. He acted as if he was extremely inconvenienced by us being there. TERRIBLE!"}
{"text":"[I wrote this three years ago but somehow never posted it here.  Never again.  Never ever ever again.]  I've ordered from these guys a few times, and their gyros, while greasy, are pretty tasty. The service has always been more than a bit surly, but tonight takes the cake. Here's a breakdown: 7:50 P.M. I order two jumbo gyros with no onions and no tomatoes. After giving my credit card info to the guy on the phone (who is ornery as anything) I repeat: \"I did say 'No tomatoes and no onions, right?\" \"I heard you!\" he snaps.  9:10 PM I call back, reminding him that I placed my order an hour and twenty minutes ago. I had expected the standard \"It will be there soon,\" but was somewhat surprised to hear him say, \"The driver will be back soon and he will pick it up then.\"  9:30 The food finally arrives. I bring it into my apartment to find two gyros with-- you guessed it-- onions and tomatoes. I call to inform the restaurant of this error. The guy on the phone adamantly insists that, having prepared the order himself, he is certain there are no onions and tomatoes, to which I respond that I am, in fact, looking at onions and tomatoes. Now all these shenanigans would have been enough, had I not received another knock on my door at...  9:40 The delivery guy knocks on my door. He does not have my food. He is here to PICK UP the erroneous order! This is the sort of thinking that leads these folks to take two hours delivering your food. I ask him why he is stopping by for this food, but the question seems to go over his head. \"Never mind,\" I say, \"It's just that it's been two hours.\" \"Yes,\" he responds. \"But we are very busy.\"   9:50 Still waiting for my gyro and saliva combo..."}
{"text":"Food is delicious but everything else is awful. The staff is rude, gruff and unpleasant. They answer the phone with \"Yea.\" So you aren't even sure you've reached a business or just some guy.  Delivery from them is predictably horrible. It has never taken less than an hour and a half. Usually about two hours regardless of what they tell you.  But I have to say the Gyros are delicious and the Lamb kabob was scrumptious if a smallish portion. Their curried rice is flavorful and always tastes fresh. I love the food but hate the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from campusfood.com. they had to change the order because they were out of the curry. The order took over an hour to deliver. One of the items was wrong (chicken gyro, not the regular gyro). The chicken was WAY too salty. The larger portion appears to just be extra meat, not more toppings, so the meal is left unbalanced. The other dish (some beef patty with rice) was mediocre. The meat was decent but it was just 4 lumps of meat and rice, no sauce, veges, or anything to pull it together."}
{"text":"The lamb biryani is awesome. Strictly take-out material though. Don't even think about eating in."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious. The guy behind the counter isn't super smiley but that doesn't make a difference to me. I have lived across the street for 7 mos and never walked in there since I don't usually crave Middle Eastern/Greek food, but now I really regret it. I thought the falafel was delicious and the regular portion size was perfect. My boyfriend got the gyros which was also fantastic for the low price.   If you live nearby you should totally check it out. The fries are also delicious! I think people tend to go to like Jimmy John's and McDonalds too much and should support these smaller businesses instead. Especially this one because it's really good!"}
{"text":"I won't go here again. The food is ok, but the place is a dump, and the worker (owner?) acted like it was a hassle that we were there ordering food from his business."}
{"text":"Took over 2 1/2 hours for our delivery & it still never came, we were starving. The owner also called to tell us that he didn't have the ingredients for both of the orders we placed so we had to select new menu items. Driver called to tell us it would be another 20-30 minutes & admitted our food was in the car for over an hour. We called to cancel because we no longer wanted to eat the rotten food that had been sitting for who knows how long. Rude owner called back to tell us he refunded our money as a favor to us & that we should never to order from him again... no problem buddy. Worst customer service, delivery & restaurant in Madison I have ever had an experience with."}
{"text":"I actually like the food, but the owner is rude as hell. I ordered delivery a few times and always asked him not to ring the doorbell. He always did. The last time I ordered, he took almost 2 hours to get to me and then rang the doorbell 8-10 times, like a child. I still would have ordered, except now he says he doesn't deliver to my address, even though his delivery zone on every website says he does. This guy doesn't deserve your business."}
{"text":"I only had one experience with Campis Biryani and it was so profoundly negative that I haven't bothered to give it a second chance.   I can't speak for the physical location as my order was for delivery. I can't even speak to their food quality.  I placed the order at 2pm for linner (lunch and dinner, it's the lazy man's brunch, don't judge me) and after waiting an hour I called to see what was going on and they told me they would not start the order until 4pm and they would deliver it then, they were done with lunch when I ordered. The tone said even more than the message -- it said \"I'm doing you the favor of sending you anything at all, so just wait.\"  At that point I attempted to cancel the order and was cut off repeatedly until I had to yell at him to cancel my order. I don't get provoked to yelling easily, so it's quite telling that they managed to do so.  I'll never know how good or bad their food is because after that -- I'll never order from them again."}
{"text":"this place is what nightmares are made of and i never even got to taste the food... I got delivery.. the order was 1 hour late.. I calld grub hub they said he was in my parking lot to e down and get my food...I live in a house.. no parking lot. near me.. The driver then proceeded to call my cell phone 15X when i did try an talk to him he did not speak english..He then came to my door and rang the bell and banged on the door for 15 minutes.. Grub hub had already canceled the order..they got the restaurant to get the driver to leave... I have never ever had a delivery experience like this.. SO DONT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE ..."}
{"text":"Ugh. What a struggle this was. Ordered food from here via GrubHub and was told 40 mins to an hour. Okay cool. No problem. Bring on the deliciousness!  70 minutes later, no food at my door. Called in to see what was up, was told it would be another 15. Okay, no problem.   30 minutes later, still nothing. Called in again. 15 more minutes. A grumpy 15 minutes, mind you. Um, okay.   The food finally arrived, well over an hour later than initially promised.   I get it - things happen, sometimes it takes a while - but what doesn't fly is the fact that there was no apology, no thanks for your patience, nothing. Just an ornery, annoyed man answering the phone, repeating the 15 minute promise.   The food though, it was great. It's always great! I guess that's why I continue to eat from here. I think I've learned my lesson as far as delivery goes, though.   My advice: Just pick it up! Go in yourself. GrubHub was great and did give a $10 credit for the extreme delay (not even their fault!), but it's just not worth the headache."}
{"text":"I have had mixed experiences with this restaurant. The lunch buffet has been very good at times but whenever I have ordered something it has been a disappointment and expensive. Unfortunately, I ended up here on a date in the winter months and the place was almost as cold as it was outside. We literally could see our breath as we were sitting right next to a gigantic space heater. The staff has always seemed somewhat aloof and it almost seems they forget that they are actually running a restaurant instead of a lounge to watch the BBC. With that said I have had some satisfying lunch buffet encounters so it hasn't been all bad. My short advice: summertime lunch buffet."}
