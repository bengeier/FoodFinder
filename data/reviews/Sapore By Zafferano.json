{"text":"Was here last night for Valentine's and I have to say it was great. Food was as home cook Italian as you can get, staff was friendly and the prices were VERY reasonable. We can't wait to come back. Good job. Keep it up"}
{"text":"The food was great! Real Italian quality and feel. Amazing. The service was great and the design of the restaurant is very elegant."}
{"text":"Good quality food, if not a little expensive.  The brick oven pizza is amazing.  I've been to this restaurant several times and it gets loud if it's full and busy, otherwise it's usually quiet enough to easily have a conversation.  The wine list is ok, yet nothing specatucular."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere  made our visit to Sapore very pleasant. We have always loved Zaffaranos, so we knew what to expect when we visited."}
{"text":"As I walked in I was welcomed with enormous flies, and a bar full of dirty glasses.... nice restaurant, and very busy. Food was your typical italian menu, nothing great. But not bad ...service was good but a little pushy , we ordered a bottle of water, and he automatically brought another ,16 dollars later. I will go back. Overall it was ok"}
{"text":"Awesome for meeting and parties, service is awesome A+ there isn't a bad pasta on the menu, all good high quality ingredients. The mushroom risotto is my fav brought out pipping hit with parmiggiano shavings The antipasto platter for however many quests you have should start your meal off, there is a little of everything and put together fresh If you like lamb chops they do a nice job here, better than most  You can go into this restaurant and order anything on the menu no worries  Great place ...... Oh and the wood oven pizza is great!"}
{"text":"We just had dinner there. Our first time and our friends 3rd time there.  We had the worse service ever.    The waiter left us for 20-25mims at a time and then at the end of our meal we didn't see him for 45 mins. We told the manager if we could have our bill explained the issue and still no apologizes.   All the tables around us with this particular waiter received the same bad service."}
{"text":"Poor service dulled the meal.  Usually good but tonight's poor service was awful.  Apps cam with meals missing cutlery missing napkins no service.  If you don't like to serve don't be a waiter.   Your food is never that good"}
{"text":"More Woodbridge Italian than authentic Italian.  Service came with attitude,  and food was decent not great."}
{"text":"I went here because it was beside the spa i was going to otherwise i would have never gone here.  1. the atmosphere is AMAZING, its beautiful and decorated so nicely. Very clean, beautiful washrooms and all around upscale  2. Food was VERY AVERAGE. We had bruschetta and calamari as an appetizer and i don't know, honestly i've had better at a bar.... the calarmi was no seasoned enough and the bruschetta was awkwardly soggy. I had a pretty big group with me so i tried everyones food and we all shared. 4 people had gnocci and noone was too fond of it.. it was okk.... I had the new york strip and i have no complaints, but honestly the rippini was the best part of my meal... two girls had the lobster risotto and both HATED their lobster as it was clearly not fresh and water logged.   3. Service. We had two servers helping us a man and a woman. Man was outstanding and very helpful very quick and observant. The woman must have been new, she dropped the plated of calamri all over the table and spilt one of the girls drinks... and it happens i know but she wasnt even proactive to get us a new plate or clean up, it was the man who came and helped and replaced everything   overall it was okay, that's all i really got."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  If you're in the area, the options are limited!"}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner at Sapore to celebrate my sister's birthday. The service was prompt and professional, I very much enjoyed that my water glass was never left empty for too long (something very important to me as a guest - I'm always super thirsty!). I had the Ortolana pizza, which has rapini, mushrooms, peppers, zucchini, eggplant, and mozzarella. Honestly, this pizza was OUTSTANDING! Cooked perfectly, fresh ingredients, beautifully melted cheese...If I could have eaten 12 of those pizzas, I definitely would have. Everyone else in my party also thoroughly enjoyed their meals. I would definitely return to Sapore for more pizza!"}
{"text":"The decor is nice. The staff is friendly. The food is very good. But in my opinion the prices are just too high for what you get. I ordered a veal chop which was very good but forgettable."}
{"text":"Like usual this place aims to satisfy. The food was great overall. The service was a little slow... and the chicken was super dry but the veal was amazing as were the calamari and shrimp. I come here often  and really love the food.   I appreciate the fresh bread served with the meal and my kids enjoy the appetizer fish dish. Calamari shrimp and fish is to die for.   I have eaten the pizza here many times as well which is off the charts. Quattro staggioni is the best.   The pasta is always spot on too. The home made fettuccine was out of this world and the sauce was traditional and true to Italian origin. Outstanding job.   The desserts were all amazing and fresh.  Thank you for another memorable meal. Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Oh the taste of Sapore! Located in a somewhat desolate area of Woodbridge, this restaurant is a real gem of Italian food. Having to compete with many other Italian restaurants in the community, Sapore brings it up a notch with the high quality of their ingredients, attentive service, and rustic yet classy decor. I was here recently with my sister, and enjoyed the carpaccio di cervo and crostini di burrata to start; both were delicious. For my main dish I ordered the risotto ai porcini which was flavourful and cooked perfectly. There were many other items I wanted to try, as the menu offers a large variety of authentic Italian dishes. I guess I will have to wait until my next visit. Although it is a little far for me, it is certainly worth the drive for buon Sapore!"}
{"text":"This was our Valentine's dinner spot for year 2017. It had a grand rustic feel when I entered the restaurant. The servers were wearing all black and were very hospitable. Majority of the servers were also new Italian immigrants, so my experience felt authentic.  The food was delicious. The grilled calamari was grilled beautifully and the balsamic drizzle with olives and capers have it an amazing sweet and salty flavour. I had the Gnocchi stuffed with ricotta cheese in a rosé sauce. I'm a big fan of gnocchi and the different ways it's served and this was so delicious. I savoured every bite; although, it melted in my mouth so I don't think I did much chewing LOL.  Last but not least after all that food and wine there is always room for dessert. We shared the cream brûlée. It was served in quite a big dish which I was totally fine with :P that too was not overly sweet and very delicious. Had a good experience here!"}
{"text":"I've worked around the corner from this place for years, and I never knew how beautiful it was inside! Located in an industrial plaza in Woodbridge, this restaurant is huge and wonderfully decorated - rustic and classic looking. Warm Italian feel.   My Meal: Pollo Portofino Pan seared chicken breast with roasted red pepper and mushroom in a pesto white wine sauce. Served with roasted potatoes and grilled vegetables.   Verdict?: YUM! The chicken was tender and flavourful. The veggies were crisp. The roasted potato was...ok. But if that was the weak point, that's fine by me.   This is a venue of choice for my colleagues when we want to take a client out for a nice lunch. I would definitely bring someone here! I'd like to try one of their pizzas...a colleague at the table ordered one and it looked awesome.   Wait staff was friendly and attentive. As Arnold says... \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"Went to a friends birthday dinner at this restaurant. It's a beautiful place but the service was poor.   We arrived 8:30pm on a Wednesday, so it wasn't very busy.   After we placed our order, it took 45 mins to get our meals, by that time we were very hungry and he didn't even offer us bread at the table, but everyone else was being served.   Our waiter spoke little to no English, and I feel like the language barrier was a part of the issue. All he kept saying we \"it's good, it's good.\"  Some of us got our dinner, and when my friend asked what kind of meat was on her plate it, he said it was horse meat.   I'd suggest no one eat here, it's not worth the money and the service sucks."}
{"text":"Major disappointment on New Years Eve Dinner.  I decided  to return to Sapore where I previously enjoyed the wood oven pizza, which was actually quite good.  Though for New Years Eve they had a reduced menu and the pizza oven was not an option for anyone.  The dinner was at 5:30 and the restaurant was less then half full.    We had a table of 4 and we all ordered appetizers, rib eye steaks at $36.00 each and a bottle of wine. The steaks were all cooked incorrectly, especially my steak that was grilled beautifully on one side, though heavily burnt on the bottom side.  While, other steaks were raw and almost cold to touch in the middle.  The vegetables were very poorly chosen as grilled leaks and beets did not compliment the dish that had a sweet blueberry steak sauce.   Very disappointing, if it wasn't a busy new years eve night, I would have certainly returned the dish.    As for the appetizers (salads and calamari) and entrees the portions were disappointingly small for the price.  The prices are not justifiable.  The quality and quantity are severely lacking.    Often good service can compensate, though our server \"Shirley\" was lacking professionalism.  She did not give proper attention and likely did not submit our order properly as we waiting an excessive amount of time for our food considering the amount of people in the venue.  She was unpersonable and unsympathetic.  Even with only 4 guests she automatically included 15% tip on the bill, she probably had a good sense she wasn't probably deserving to get that if she wouldn't have done that.    As for the venue, one positive is that it is beautiful place.  The decor, color scheme and presentation make for a comforting yet elegant restaurant environment.    I do NOT recommend.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Went here cause a friend recommended we all go for Italian. So we went at around 8:00pm on a Friday night. Friend told me it's nice and not too expensive.   When we got there, the place didn't look inexpensive, but it had a beautiful atmosphere. Place I would definitely take a date too. They have a nice balcony area, but was told that it was for reservations and parties. That's okay.   We sat at a table close to a raptors game that they had on screen. It was playing cause it was an important game, else if would not be on. Mostly couples were around, and strangely all the guys were facing the screen...  Lol   First, ask them for tap water, they will bring you bottled water otherwise and that costs 6 bucks a pop.   I ordered a pizza upon recommendation of my friends,  che-che-ri-che I think it was called. Wow it was good, and see the picture. I left none of it to waste. Seriously. None.   Had a glass of wine too.   All together cost me individually $30. Not bad and I am pretty filled . I would definitely recommend. Especially for a date."}
