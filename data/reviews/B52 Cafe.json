{"text":"Had an amazing lunch with a friend today at B52! We each had the specialty latte, which was extremely creamy and delicious with notes of orange, vanilla and cinnamon. For our appetizer, we choose a trio of dips(hummus, cashew cheese dip and eggplant dip). While we loved them all, our favorite was definitely the eggplant dip, which had a delicious smokey flavor. The dips came with a side of the best and freshest pita bread we have ever had! As our main meals, she got the cashew cheese flatbread and I got the kofta. Both were sooo fresh and full of flavor! We ended our meals with a cinnamon bun (because we couldn't help ourselves), and oh my goodness it tasted like paradise on earth. Wow, I really cannot say enough about how lovely B52 is. Truly an amazing addition to the Pittsburgh vegan restaurant scene!"}
{"text":"Came here on a date night and was not disappointed. We split the six-plate mezze and every dish was delicious (though the fried tomatoes definitely stole the spotlight). It was the perfect amount of food for two and service was great throughout. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"B52 blew me away. The restaurant decor is just beautiful, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, and the food is magnificent. 

We started the lentil soup, which is definitely my new favorite soup in the city. We also shared the seitan sausage, hummus, baba ghanoush, and falafel - all incredible and very fresh. My friend and I both agreed that it was some of the best baba ghanoush we've ever had. Smoked eggplant is genius. 

The kombucha i tried and almond milk I had in my coffee were also great and I learned they actually make both of those in-house! We also tried some of their chocolate and I can't even handle how great it was on top of the rest of our meal.

This is already one of my favorite places. So excited to have such an amazing vegan friendly restaurant in the city!"}
{"text":"I sought this place out for a unique breakfast experience in Lawrenceville neighborhood and arrived just after 9am. It was not crowded, and the service was very fast. I ordered a latte that came with almond milk (it's vegan after all) but the after taste was so bad my stomach turned every time I took a sip. I've never had an almond milk latte before so I have no idea if this is normal tasting. My husband loved his straight up black coffee, so I think if you don't get fancy it's all good.

I had toast with cashew butter and raspberry jam which was delicious, and potato / carrot latkes. They were fine.

Husband had a tofu seitan scramble with kale, which was also basic and fine. We were on vacation so had no access to a kitchen--it would have been a very easy thing to make quickly at home too. 

The experience was capped off by the couple next to us discussing in horror that we get our coconut products from slave monkeys that are beaten and abused if they do not harvest enough coconuts."}
{"text":"I have an almost-vegan friend and she has heard good things about this place, so we went to check it out. We went on a Saturday noon and it was very crowded. It took us more than 30 mins to be seated. The decoration is very nice but the space is pretty small. They have lots of vegan food including cheese and hand-made chocolates that they bake themselves. The menu is medium-sized and decently explained. I had shiitake mushroom on flatbread and baba ganoush. My friends had falafel sandwich and avocado and raspberry toast with cashew cheese.
It took them a long time to bring our beverages, but the food came in a decent time. My shiitake mushroom flatbread had too much kale and too little mushroom on it and it was greasy. Baba ganoush was delicious and falafel was good. The cactus drink had a weird aftertaste. None of us liked it. Their cashew cheese was delicious tho. In general I think they are short of staff. The food is good but not super delicious."}
{"text":"I am not a vegan, but I do enjoy healthy and delicious food. B52 definitely provides both and in a lovely atmosphere to boot. This really is a lovely place. Marble bar, cool color scheme, and exposed brick provide a balance of elegance and grunge. Onto delicious drinks like creative kombucha and soda flavors. The food is flavorful and satisfying. I cannot even guess how they pack so much flavor into their fried tomatoes, but that secret alone will keep me coming back to enjoy the rich flavors and relaxing space provided by B52's wonderful staff."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times for brunch and have had a great experience each time. The wait isn't long, the service is good, and the food has been consistently tasty.

I would highly recommend the falafel and the cookies. I get hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"It was so good I came back for more. I stayed in Pittsburgh for the weekend and this little place was down the block. Had dinner and breakfast the next morning here. Baba ganoush was the best I've had and their homemade seitan was great. They had so much great stuff on the menu. Defiantly a destination spot for vegans/vegetarians or just people looking for great food."}
{"text":"While visiting our daughter for the Christmas holiday we had lunch at B52.  It was our last day and we had several options.  Choosing B52 was easy.  The day before we dropped in for coffee/lattes to go.  They were excellent.  For lunch we had avocado toast, latke, shawarma, roasted cauliflower and coffee drinks again.  Everything was delicious. Generous in portions. The wait team was attentive, happy and helpful.  Omar, the owner, stopped by and shared a story or 2.  When we go back to Lawrenceville next spring we will be back!"}
{"text":"Defintely has  room to improve.  I came away with a 50/50 experience.  Loved the decor, the drop ceiling, the energy.  We had the Manakish and baba ghanoush.  The appetizer portions are too small for the price.  I loved the cashew cheese manakish but the shitake manakish lacked seasoning.  We asked for some flavor and got salt and pepper."}
{"text":"First legitimate Middle Eastern/Vegetarian place in Pitt.  Take your pick off the menu - you wont go wrong!  Highly recommend the tea."}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh recently, and of course tried as many vegan or vegan-friendly places as possible. B52 stood out. We went for a weekday breakfast, so those were the only foods we tried. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive, and helped us choose amongst the multiple tempting choices on the menu. I got the spicy kofta tofu scramble, which was truly amazing. I've had a lot of scrambles, but this one was especially good. We tried the cashew cheese mannish (flatbread) too, and that was great. And don't miss the baked goods - the brownie was fair, but the chocolate chip cookies were divine, and vegan cinnamon rolls? I can be pretty picky about those, but these were perfect. So glad to have found this place!!"}
{"text":"After waiting excitedly for this place to open, I stopped in for brunch. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable, and attentive with out being intrusive. I hear it can get busy, but the atmosphere is also welcoming to the lone bruncher or coffee sipper. I ordered the tofu scramble and toast with almond butter and raspberry jam. The food was fresh and very flavorful. Good portion sizes. Will be making this a regular brunch spot. Can't wait to try the lunch food (and hopefully dinner soon)!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I went with a friend for lunch. Neither of us are vegan/veg but we wanted something lighter with this crazy hot weather and it looked like they would have a lot of different options. The waitress was really attentive and nice and was happy to help my friend with new dietary restrictions customize something that she could eat. I had the sauteed shiitakes and spinach along with the lentil soup of the day. The soup was phenomenal- high in flavor (not in saltiness) and really filling. My friend had the avocado salad which was a generous portion and with an amazing lemony dressing. The baba ganoush was fantastic- creamy and smoky (but not overly so). Everything was very high in flavor and visually appealing too. I will definitely be back to try all of the other things that looked great (cashew cheese flatbread, avocado toast, falafel, and many others). Also looks like a great take-out spot with a cafe window and tasty looking treats to go (hummus, baba, pickled vegetables, all sorts of desserts). Definitely great for vegans and non-vegans alike!"}
{"text":"We finally got in to this place on a Saturday for lunch and I'm so glad we waited! My guy got the Seitan shwarma wrap and I got the cashew cheese wrap and minestrone soup. We were blown away by how fresh and delicious everything was. Great portions and even better prices. We will definitely be back soon! Great addition to the pittsburgh scene"}
{"text":"The dining experience and service is pathetic. After we were seated for 15 minutes nobody came to check on us. I had to stand up and go after some server and ask for menu, water, etc. Then he said \"sorry\".

After that we tried the cashew cheese appetizer, my husband and I both liked it. For main course, I had the onion flat bread and he had the falafel sandwich. The onion flatbread was too sweet ( I am not sure if they added sugar or not). I was expecting more of a savory taste, also because on the menu it indicated that it has sumac (one of my favorite spices) which has a savory/sour taste. I did not like the onion flatbread. My husband said the falafel sandwich was not very well balanced: some parts had too little veggies to balance out the falafel. 

I would have liked to return to try out other items on the menu, but with their pathetic service, I doubt it."}
{"text":"Amazing. I'm vegan for 6 months now and it's so awesome to find a spot like this. I overate and made myself sick because everything was SO GOOD and SO VEGAN!! The service was great, super chill atmosphere, and delicious food. I cannot wait to return. Did I mention it was amazing?! Also worth mentioning, my non vegan friend was with me and she enjoyed absolutely everything we ordered as well. I give it a 6 out of 5!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for a vegetarian vegan spot with great food and a comfortable Nuevo Diner ambiance. Great coffee and espresso too. Small with limited seating makes it an instant classic, intimate neighborhood go to.  Great service and everything else. I can't write much but stop reading and get yo B52. No I do not own the place it's just damn good. Pittsburgh needs a lot more quality vegetarian spots like this."}
{"text":"I have eaten at vegan restaurants on the West Coast and the East, and this place tops all of them... so much flavor tastefully done. I highly recommend the fries, the sauces, the sodas, and the flatbread. This place is new, so go there - We need to keep this place going in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great! I was a really chill place to eat and relax. One of the few vegan restaurants in the area and worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great venue. I had the mixed platter with hummus falafel babe ghanoush etc and it was solid. Cookies are pretty good too"}
{"text":"Awesome dining experience. Pittsburgh may not have a ton of vegan restaurants compared to other cities of that size, but B52 makes up for it with sheer quality and a welcome assault on your tastebuds. 
If I lived here I would be here multiple times a week!
Great friendly staff, non pretentious vibe, beautifully presented food and incredibly authentic flavor profiles when it comes to middle eastern food.
Love it!"}
{"text":"Like to compliment B52 for doing excellent job catering last night for our Iftar..There was a variety of food with selective decisions which complimented each other..will purchase for personal consumption... Good Job Masha'allah"}
{"text":"Don't even know what the hell I was eating but it was all fantastic am definitely going back"}
{"text":"Got the Kofta tofu scramble and it was perfect. Also a \"bottomless\" coffee ($3 on weekends). This place exceeded my expectations. I arrived from out of town, flustered because I don't know the area, traffic was bad and parking difficult (you can parallel park on the street on Sundays, but its tight and just one lane in each direction so you piss off the people behind you). The café is adorable, clean and bright. There was a queue for tables but as I was dining on my own, I was seated at the gorgeous marble counter immediately. 

They were really busy and I was probably not their ideal guest: party of one, and desperate to get online on my laptop (generally frowned upon in restaurants, especially trendy busy ones) for reasons I won't go into. Suffice it to say I was desperate enough to risk the eyerolls of busy staff..... but at B52 I didn't have to. Everyone was polite and efficient and helpful to a fault. I LOVED the food, it absolutely hit the spot. And I think I had three coffee refills before heading out. 

I would definitely brave the traffic and parking to come again!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Cozy/ hip cafe atmosphere with a great menu and great drinks. Awesome place to grab lunch"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised by the quality of all the ingredients. The falafel was so well made and I have frequented many NY and LA falafel joints. I couldn't believe there wasn't any cream in my Matcha tea until they explained that they make their own almond milk! It was so rich and guilt free!! We will definitely return to try more!"}
{"text":"INVENTIVE APPEALING VEGAN

Hi All!

Working the side job as a world renown photographer ...note SLIGHT sarcasm...I finished some work on a shoot in town and decided I wanted something healthy, filling and different.

I Yelp searched and decided to head to Larryville for a late lunch. And I have to admit I was starving so I quickly ordered a falafel wrap and a chocolate muffin. Both were very tasty. I love the homemade pickled veggies in the wrap and I have to admit it was a giant portion so I had plenty to take home.

Chocolate muffin was very rich and delicious. Such a treat with way less guilt.

I fully intend to return and try more items on their menu!

Love you! 
Bye!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE

The kofta tofu scramble, cashew cheese manakish, moussaka entree and chocolate chip cookies are my favorites so far.  I plan on trying a lot more dishes and their Sunday brunch specials when I get a chance.  Everything is flavored just right, not too much or too little and nothing is over or under salted which is the case at so many restaurants even the high-end ones.  I don't know about others but the entrees leave me feeling full for at least 6-7 hours.  Bottom line, even if you are not vegan, you will find more than one thing to enjoy here."}
{"text":"This is my very first Yelp post, and I think it says a lot that the quality of this restaurant prompted me to make a Yelp profile. 
I'm not vegan or even vegetarian. And i would eat here everyday. I've been back 4 times so far and have every intention of making this a regular spot. 
Great food and service! You have to try the baba ganoush and the avocado toast. they have a great tea selection as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If I could give B52 zero stars it would be negative. The worst service I've ever experience. We've been waiting 40 mins for avocado toast and our server is unbelievably rude... I normally am not the type to write reviews but I'm shocked by the lack of customer service. Food is fine. I guess. The experience was just completely ruined."}
{"text":"B52 blew me away. The restaurant decor is beautiful, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, and the food is magnificent. 

We started the lentil soup, which is definitely my new favorite soup in the city. We also shared the seitan sausage, hummus, baba ghanoush, and falafel - all incredible and very fresh. My friend and I both agreed that it was some of the best baba ghanoush we've ever had. Smoked eggplant is genius. 

The kombucha I tried and almond milk I had in my coffee were also great and I learned they actually make both of those in-house! We also tried some of their chocolate and I can't even handle how great it was on top of the rest of our meal.

This is already one of my favorite places. So excited to have such an amazing vegan friendly restaurant in the city!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan but if there were more restaurants like this I would be. Fantastic menu and the food was superb. Going back soon and often."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.  We wanted to go somewhere that wasn't meat-centric, as we're both vegetarians.  There was a good selection of flatbreads and finger foods on the menu.  I tried the falafel sandwich.  It was huge and amazingly good.  The falafel was just the right texture, and the fixings on the sandwich were perfect.  My partner had a flatbread since she was looking for something a bit lighter.  It was a perfect match for what she wanted.  The servers were really friendly and pleasant.  I can't wait to stop back for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I'm a huge meat eater so i wasn't particularily looking for a vegan place, but the menu looked great so we gave it a try. 
and OMGGGG was it worth it!
We had the seitan shwarma, pick 3 with pita: Labneh, Fried Cauliflower (with garlic and lemon and some crazy delicious sauce), and Fried Tomatos. I cannot begin to describe to you how incredibl and flavorful the Labneh was with just the right amount of mint and extra olive oil drizzled on top. It danced around my mouth and just made me want to smile the whole time i was eating it. I can't wait to bring friends and have them try it! Fried tomatos instantly made me think of fried green tomatoes so when they arrived and it was red tomatoes, I must admit i was disappointed. However misguided my disappointment, they were very tasty and my partner would certainly order it again cuz he scraped that bowl clean with his pita.there was a great drizzle of cream sauce (it might've been tahini but I couldn't put my finger on the flavor amidst the tomatoes) and what appeared to be a drizzle of green tomatoes also. Now, on to my favorite: the fried cauliflower. There's an incredible kick of a spice that screams Middle Eastern cuisine and the best texture from the frying that I've ever had for cauliflower! i'm a stickler for great texture and the crisp seasoned florets with the tender stalks was awesome an was paired with a great creamy sauce (again, might've been tahini with some spice, not 100% sure). To be honest, the worst part was that I ate it so fast that I didn't feel like I have enough of it (I was sharing with my partner)! Not to discount any of these amazing flavors, the seitan schwarma was also incredible. the texture of the romaine and the great pickled turnips went great with the shaved and sesasoned seitan! 

For the record, ordering a pick 3 and a sandwich was PLENTY for 2 people. probably would've served 3 as we took home half of the sandwich and finished all of the sides instead. We also ordered a chickory root beverage that was unusual but good and the blood orange basil soda. The soda was oustanding, i would probably ask for an extra sprig of basil next time becauses I love basil and could've used just a touch more of it with the orange. Our total bill was $33 plus tax and they included an extra pita at no charge. Dont get me wrong, $40 after tip for lunch for 2 is not inexpensive, but we have another whole lunch another day. You could easily get out of there for less than $10 for lunch if you skip the drink"}
{"text":"Wow. Original menu, delicious. Each meal a symphony. That may sound dramatic but it isn't.

Whether you're there for brunch, lunch or dinner you will be greeted by an inspired menu and friendly, no, the friendliest and most knowledgeable servers in Pittsburgh.

Enjoy the ambience, savor the food and the homemade Kombucha.

Go. Go now."}
{"text":"I've eaten here dozens of times now, And I've loved it every time! The breakfast scrambles are very tasty, the greens cooked in garlic and shiitake are a great addition (which you can also get in one of their nice flatbread options), and the potatoes are just on point! Their falafel is amazing whether you prefer the salad or the wrap. The cabbage slaw with lemon gives such a perfect fresh, bright, acidic touch to the tender but crispy and flavorful falafal. I recommend their harissa sauce on everything, it's so good!
The coffee has always been yummy, but I'm an even bigger fan of the \"Chic Roja\" rooibos latte! They usually have some flavor of Kombucha on tap and the 3 or 4 times Ive had it ive really enjoyed it. Lastly, their chocolates are awesome little bites to grab on your way out. 
The place has always been clean, and the staff has always been friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. My only critiques at all would be the sign outside can be easy to miss driving through, and the smaller size of the place which tends to get backed up quickly, but for food that good it's understandable. 
I highly recommend B52!"}
{"text":"As a former vegan I can attest that some of their food is quite Heavenly or good at least but as a whole lot of their food is heavy on the wheat so it is not kind to the gluten conscious. I find the food good, the staff sir so friendly a little bit too uppity for my case. The cost is a little above the reasonable and my Spectrum so I prefer to make a lot of what they serve at home. It's decent vegan food but I have seen better vegan restaurants open and close then this one."}
{"text":"Loved the wonderful vegan brunch! The falafel wrap, lentil soup and the cashew cheese flat bread were perfectly sumptuous. The service was excellent. Definitely plan to make this a regular stop on weekends!"}
{"text":"Everything is so good. I'm not even a vegan and I've  been fantasizing about their dinner all week. The chocolate chip cookie may be my favorite ever. Chocolate cake- I hate cake but this is the most moist delicious cake I have ever had. The cashew cheese is on sour dough omg."}
{"text":"I think like a lot of meat eaters, I was a bit apprehensive about eating at a vegan restaurant. Not because I don't like vegetables or appreciate vegan cuisine, I just think that lots of restaurants who \"do\" vegan food cop out by putting lots of salads or other raw dishes on the menu and not really cooking quality food. You will not have that problem at the B-52 Cafe. 

I started with a turmeric latte, which was tasty on warming on a chilly rainy day.
The food is really outstanding. When we were eating our food it was easy to forget that you were in a vegan restaurant, The food is tasty and filling, the Middle Eastern flavors are bold and make you really not miss the protein that many non-vegans might. The baba ghanouj was smoky and flavorful.  I think that this is a dish that is often bitter and not well-made in many restaurants. I'm usually not a big hummus person at all I tend to feel as if it all taste the same way. But this hummus was very delicious. It was smooth and creamy with just the right amount of garlic. We also had a Za'atar Flatbread, topped with an abundance of spices and what I believe was both sesame and olive oil, it left me wanting seconds. 

The pita bread is honestly to die for. It is light and fluffy and not at all what comes to mind when you think stereotypical vegan baking.

I've never really tried to find any vegan or vegetarian places in the city of Pittsburgh, but this is a solid recommendation to have in my back pocket for friends who are vegan or vegetarian."}
{"text":"B52 recently opened in Pittsburgh and as a vegetarian, I had lots of friends sending me articles about the new vegan place opening in Lawrenceville. I couldn't be happier that my friends shared the news with me. B52 is a lovely, sun-filled cafe on Butler street (at the corner of Butler and 52nd... hence B52, I would presume). They have a coffee bar and lots of pastries and tables for sitting and ordering food. Their website touts the food as an American and Middle Eastern fusion, and it is quite delightful. As a vegetarian, I often am disappointed with vegan places because I still do want the eggs, cheese, dairy, etc. and miss them in vegan cuisine. However, the food at B52 is great and I didn't even notice the lack of dairy and eggs! The first time I went, I had the Kofta Tofu Scramble, which was good. Both times I went, I had a wonderful drink called the Love Potion #8, which is essentially a raspberry mocha (decadent and wonderful!). The second time, I got the avocado toast (not truly toast, as the bread is soft and untoasted, but I preferred it that way), which was fantastic, and a side of latkes, which were good but not as good as others I've had. Overall, it was a pleasant environment with nice good, wonderful coffee drinks, and relatively good service (a little slower than it should have been given the number of patrons the times I was there). The prices are a little on the high side for the amount of food you're getting, but are certainly reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding! In town for the holiday and needed a vegan restaurant for my daughter. Based on Yelpers recommendations alone we stopped by for lunch. Had falafel with fries while kids had lentil soup, seitan shawarma and spicy kofta tofu. Everything was A+. Highly recommend this place even if you're not a vegan."}
{"text":"Amazing food, Im not vegan but occasionally Im open to trying good vegan food from time to time. This was by far the best vegan brunch I've had in the city!! I ordered the avocado toast, latke and a side of tofu scramble with blood orange basil soda to drink. It was all very fresh, hot and filling for a very reasonable price. I will definitely be back sometime soon"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, very accommodating when it came to my allergies. Server was good and loved the atmosphere. Would have given 5 stars but it was a little slow."}
{"text":"I tried B52 tonight for the first time and think I'm in love. I will be dreaming of their baba ganoush. Hands down the best I've ever had. I got a falafel wrap and my partner got the kabob, and both were really delicious. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since my friend and I had lunch there so my memory is a bit blurry except to say that I'd go back there again real soon. I had the seitan shawarma half of which I took home 'cause it was pretty generous (I had some yummy lentil soup first). No room for dessert but they looked delish."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch today. Great selection of vegan meals. I ordered the falafel and side salad. It was reasonably priced and delicious. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"When I first walked into B52, I noticed the drop ceiling with reclaimed tin ceiling tiles and open brick walls. The layout and color palette was relaxing and quaint. The 32 seat cafe includes a full service coffee and espresso bar, as well as, small bakery and take out section. While waiting for a table, my mouth watered over the fresh baked goods including vegan cinnamon rolls, brownies, truffles, cookies, and more!

The menu has a Mediterranean theme, but it also includes some general vegan staples such as tofu scramble and buckwheat pancakes. The best part about the menu is that everything is made in house and prepared fresh! The kofta tofu scramble is a MUST try for brunch!

Don't hesitate to head to B52 for your next vegan meal! Check out my full review at http://veganhostess.com/2016/01/19/restaurant-review-b52-cafe-in-pittsburgh/"}
{"text":"Awesome, great good and staff. Only beef is they hand wash the coffee cups up front. Get a dishwasher!"}
{"text":"Two words. Tofu. Scramble.
Great customer service, laid back atmosphere and grade A food selection!"}
{"text":"The space is nice, and it's nice to have an option for vegan food, however the food itself is just ok.  

The side salad was way too heavily dressed, such that you can't actually taste the greens and veggies you're eating.  Personally when I go to a vegan/vegetarian restaurant, it's because I want to taste some vegetables, not vegetables masked as or pretending to be something else.

Overall, a nice setting to get pricey, average food."}
{"text":"Popped in today for a quick breakfast to go. Cafe au lait with homemade almond milk was delicious. The milk was rich and creamy-yum! Also got a strawberry lemon muffin. It was still warm and there were nice big chunks of strawberry. It was excellent. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu. So far so good."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here! Stopped by one day after work, not sure if I would like it because I am not vegan. I was pleasantly surprised! The staff was super friendly. And the food was delicious and so flavorful! I got the falafel and was a huge fan of the tahini sauce that goes with it. I also ordered the fattoush (listed as a garden salad but don't be fooled, the lemon, sumac, olive oil dressing is so light, fresh, and delicious!) also the onion flatbread which is known as msakhan in Arabic. I enjoyed everything so much. Learned they have a coffee bar inside too and the latte creations sounded amazing but decided not to get one to force me to come back again :)"}
{"text":"Back to reinforce my last five-star review with another five stars--B52 earns them. Came in on an early Sunday afternoon for brunch and was disappointed to find that the pancakes had sold out. I settled on  a piece of the peanut butter toast with raspberry preserves in addition to the cashew yogurt parfait (and a cafe rico, of course). SO GOOD. The peanut butter is made in house and was slathered generously on a thick piece of bread that was toasted to crispy-outside-meets-chewy-inside goodness. The yogurt parfait was absolutely delightful, topped with some thinly sliced banana and a touch of agave syrup. Together, these made a perfectly filling and satisfying brunch to the point where I wasn't upset about missing out on the fabled pancakes (though I anticipate coming back during the week to give them a whirl!)."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were looking for a good vegan restaurant in Pittsburgh and decided to try thus place out. He's a vegan and I am a willing participant and wow this place surpassed my expectations. Everything was flavorful and I love their spice blends. Plus you get a good amount of food for tour money. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal brunch. Had the tofu scramble, avocado toast, and their iced green tea with agave. Unbelievable combo. Definitely ask for their hot sauce. Will undoubtedly be coming back as early as next weekend."}
{"text":"My friends are vegan and are taking me to vegan cafes. This is pretty great place except they close early which I experienced several times."}
{"text":"Delicious food, inviting atmosphere, friendly service. High quality all round. I had a cashew cheese sandwich that was delicious. Baba is very good too. My son loved the chocolate chip cookie. Happy to have a legitimately good new veggie place in town."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite cafe in Pittsburgh. It's unbelievable how everything is vegan, and I love meat! The toast is thick cut and you can get it with avocado (topped with sesame seeds and tahini, this is my favorite dish there) or cashew cheese and jam (the cashew cheese is worth a try, but the flavor is pretty strong.) I like to get the sandwich and soup combo because the lentil soup is amazing, it's hearty and has a touch of lemon. The seitan shwarma sandwich is my favorite. The sandwiches are huge though, one is enough for two people. Funny enough, the coffee drinks are not their strong suit. I've tried a couple and they've always been a little weak, and not as hot as I would like. But definitely come for the food!"}
{"text":":0 :)
So. Good.
Nice prices, the wait time was fair, place was a little more intimate. Vegan options made me so happy. I was from out of town and I wish I could go back right now."}
{"text":"First off, I am an omnivore leaning towards carnivore tho I do love Middle Eastern food, which tends to be less about meat and more about plant based dishes. I was in Pittsburgh for a quick business trip with a friend of mine and we were searching for something different and came across B52 Cafe.  What a delight! The place has a real nice vibe.  Great soft music so you can still hold a conversation and the waitress was very friendly and helpful.  We ended up sharing a the Mezze \"Taste 6\" for $30 and that easily filled us up and everything was super delicious and fresh tasting.  I have been to Israel and dishes here would stack up well against anything I had there!! Be sure to save room for some vegan carrot cake. It was a big slice, big enough to share.  I did not miss the dairy at all, it was super rich and moist with icing that we fought over.  Oh, I also had a Chai latte with house made almond milk...loved the oversized mug!! 

I will definitely be back on my next pass thru Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"This is not an exaggeration: I think about the food at B52 at least once a week. And I've only eaten there  This is not an exaggeration: I think about the food at B52 at least once a week. And I've only eaten there twice!

Starting with the mezze -- the baba ghanouj was smoky and wonderful. The fried cauliflower was crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside and perfect with or without the accompanying tahini. I never thought cauliflower could taste so good! My favorite - and this is usually what I daydream about - is the labneh. Smooth, creamy, with just the right bite from the mint. Heavenly! 

The kebab with seitan came on a bed of rice with a little salad and veggies on the side of the plate. The cucumber yogurt was cool and refreshing, the perfect accompaniment the the hearty and savory seitan.

If you're looking for something on the lighter side, the manakish (flatbread) is a good bet! I had the cashew cheese manakish and it was so delightful! The crust was just the right amount, not too thick or too thin, and the cashew cheese had a bit of a bite that went well with the slightly sweet tomato sauce.

B52 might just be my favorite food in the city!"}
{"text":"Loved B52Great vegan menu loved the peanut butter toast with apricot preserves, scrambled tofu, hummus & potato pancakes. We had delicious desserts-chocolate chip cookie & vanilla cake. Friendly and quick service"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great service, delicious food in good portions and a plethora of vegan options you have to come. It's small and cute but I've never been let down the many times I've been. When you check it out you HAVE to get their hummus and pita it's worth cutting an arm off for! I'm not a fan of almond milk but what Iced Chi with almond milk has become one of favorite things to get their too! If you show up and there is a small like please stick it out, I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"New hipster Mediterranean vegan place in lawrenceville.

I had heard some rave reviews from my veggie friends but I just wasn't wowwed.

I had been excited to try some of their lunch entrees but beware- they only serve brunch on the weekends which includes the mezzes, flatbread, salads and some tofu scrambles. So I was unable to try a regular lunch entree which I find weird.

Bustling clean restaurant with many small tables and a larger communal one in the back.
We had the kofta tofu scramble which was good and only slightly spicy with generous spinach. We also had the avocado salad which was full of lemony goodness but not a revelation. The highlight was the onion flatbread (which has been jacked up in price from $4 to $6), the onion was like onion jam and very savory.

Service was fast friendly and excellent.

It was $40 or so with tip which I find too pricey for a small flatbread, salad and scramble. Portions were generous tho."}
{"text":"I died and went to vegan heaven. I had a latte, sandwich with cashew cheese and raspberry preserves. And we also split a cinnamon roll with a friend. It was all amazing! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"The coffee is reason enough. I don't know what vegan crack they put it in, but from the specialty coffee to the basic, it was all perfection. In addition, I sampled the Chai tea and it too was delicious.  The food...not bad. I'm not vegan but I often eat foods from this genre. I've had better, and I've had worse. The pancakes were pretty good and the Seitan/Tofu Scramble was decent as well. Skip the sausage - no one at the table was a fan. I'm not sure I'll be frequently B52 for the food, but for you vegans out there, I'm sure it's a great option. The service was also on point, and that goes a long way. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sunday around 2pm for brunch. There were approx. 4 parties ahead of us, but we decided to wait the estimated 25 minutes. The hostess was extremely friendly and thanked some parties for continuing to wait. 

About 35 minutes later, we were seated at a table for two. My husband enjoyed the lemon kombucha drink and our waitress even gave us a taste of the cherry vanilla. They were both refreshing, but I enjoyed the lemon better. 

Oh, avocado toast. Where have you been all my life? Lemony, tahini-flavored, and just enough texture from the black sesame scattered top, we ordered another round (which they forgot to serve, but voluntarily took off our bill as a result). I just could not help myself. Next the lentil soup came out, orangey-red in color, which had hints of curry and small chunks of lemon zest at the bottom. The lemon was such an unexpected touch and a surprising treat, as I neared the end of my bowl. I particularly enjoyed the parsley garnish, which contrasted well with the rest of the soup's flavors. 

Out came our onion flatbreads. Now all of you 'onion-heads' like myself have something to look forward to. Flavorful and cut into four, I very much enjoyed every bite. I thought maybe a base spread would have paired well on this flatbread, but I scarfed it down nonetheless. My husband also ordered the potato cakes, which were flattened and crisp. He RAVED about the tahini dipping sauce (which I might have to learn how to make, if I know what's good for me). I personally enjoyed it, but thought some fresh garlic/some other fresh spice would have enhanced its flavors a bit more. 

Service was good and and all wait staff were friendly, although we had two servers for most of the experience, due to high crowd numbers. If you end up coming for brunch, the lot just past the cafe is free on Sundays.  I am so looking forward to returning- and hopefully next time will save room for their tempting desserts!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch last week with a group of friends.  Started with a heaping order of avocado and peanut butter toast.  Both were excellent, especially the avocado. We also had the latkes which were good but not great.  I also ordered a 3 mezze sampler.  The hummus was fresh but the babaganoush was lacking for sure (I barely had more than a few bites).  We also had the falafel sandwich (which was pretty good but again not amazing, I don't think they make their pita fresh) and the cashew cheese sandwich.  The cashew cheese was pretty gross but that's not their fault as it's never very good (may taste ok going down but your stomach will be bloated and hurting for hours after).

If you are craving interesting vegan food in Pittsburgh, I would recommend going to Apteka and skipping this place."}
{"text":"ran in for a quick lunch before an 
appointment.  waitress helpfully
suggested the soup of the day,
which happened to be lentil and which
also was delicious. great menu and was told the brunches are fab.  took a banana
but muffin to go and scarfed it down after
my meeting.  perfect!  a don't miss vegan 
local if you are near lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"I finally tried B52 with a friend after having it on my list forever. I'm happy to say it exceeded my expectations! The atmosphere during the mid-morning on a weekday was really relaxing and nice. The service was impeccable from start to finish as well. I can only imagine how great brunch is!

I started with coffee and was given ice water along with it without having to ask, which I appreciated. The coffee was a definitely a cut above what most cafés serve in terms of flavor. My friend and I both got the avocado toast, and I ordered a cinnamon roll after seeing them brought straight from the oven. The cinnamon roll was absolute perfection, and I'm already looking forward to having another. The avocado toast was perfectly executed on fluffy bread with a hint of lemon and sesame seeds on top. It's still rare to find avocado anything in Pittsburgh, so B52 is a breath of fresh air in that regard. With such great food and a host of interesting-sounding coffee drinks and other things to try, I know I'll be back very shortly."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh, beautifully made veg-friendly Mediterranean food! I'm so excited that a friend recommended we try this place instead of one of the local chains. She had been there for lunch, but not for dinner. So we went for appetizers and small plates. LOVED the apps...and the service! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just came in tonight with my boyfriend and it met my expectations completely :) I got the mushroom/spinach flatbread with the tahini sauce and my boyfriend got the mousakka?? I think it's called lol but both were AMAZING! We left feeling very full and we will be back soon for sure"}
{"text":"A wonderful vegan cafe with a Mediterranean theme, great food and attentive service. All the food is prepared fresh. Although mostly Mediterranean cuisine, the chef uses some creative tweaks to keep the food vegan. 

Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about the food. The were no missteps common to a brand new opening, except the restaurant is more wildly popular than they could have thought and by the end of the day they were all out of soup.

Pittsburghers have been looking forward to more vegan and vegetarian food, I'm sure they will embrace this marvelous new cafe."}
{"text":"I warmed up in B52 with a friend over lunch on a brisk winter day. 

The two sets of doors keep everyone toasty and eliminate that gust of cold air when people come and go. Our server greeted us upon entering and sat us immediately. The dining area was very clean. The seating was close to other tables to feel intimate, but not close enough to hear their conversations. The kitchen area is open, so we could see the food being prepared. The restaurant has the vibe of being in a friend's kitchen. 

We both ordered almondmilk maple lattes, each had a little leaf artwork on the top layer. We both ordered the avocado toast, which was on thick grainy bread and heavily drizzled with tahini sauce. My friend ordered the shitakke mushrooms on the bed of kale and I had the lentil soup with preserved lemon (special of the day). Everything was the correct temperature. The serving sizes were just enough: you leave feeling satiated, but not with a doggy bag. The pacing is great for catching up with a friend, mid-work day. 

I look forward to trying their dessert or brunch next time I visit. 

B52 makes simply makes delicious vegan food."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good I honestly can't recommend it more. I'm vegetarian and it's so nice to be able to order anything off a menu for once instead of having to search through for stuff that's not meat. Even non-vegans will definitely enjoy the food. The atmosphere is cozy and the staff is friendly. I've been here a few times and some of the best things I've ordered are the lemon ginger turmeric kombucha, cashew cheese wrap, and seitan kebab plate."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch recently. It was my first time, but she had been before and mentioned how much she loved the cashew cheese. So, I was excited to try the food, being open to vegan food because of my egg allergy. 

We walked right in and were promptly seated by a sweet and casual waitress. They have an espresso bar as well as an impressive list of teas. I elected to try their Americano, and my friend had the mint tea. Both drinks were delicious and the perfect start to a rainy afternoon lunch.

For food, I ordered the sautéed shiitake as well as the hummus. Because I eat gluten free I opted for veggies with the hummus, which was an up charge. The kale and mushrooms were very garlicky and full of flavor, and a nice portion. The hummus was creamy and topped with paprika and olive oil. It was delicious, with the veggies or just by itself! My friend ordered a flatbread and added cashew cheese. She let me taste a bite of the the cheese, and it is very smooth and tasty. If I knew what regular cheese tasted like I could better compare the two, but due to being lactose intolerant I leave the cheese tasting to my husband.

The service was a little spotty at times and the barista actually had to come get our bills for us, but overall it was a lovely experience and I hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"I was blown away by B52 when I came by for the first time last week. I have been meaning to check it out for a while and now that I have visited, I will definitely be a repeat customer. First and foremost, although I am not vegan, I greatly appreciate and love vegan food. I love that B52 is entirely vegan- Pittsburgh really needs more places like this. I came by on a weekday morning. There were some people sitting and eating but it overall wasn't very busy. While looking at the coffee menu, I nearly fell over when I read that they have \"house made almond and coconut milk\". WHAT?! How incredible is that? I cannot even think of another spot in Pittsburgh that has this as an option. I settled on a vanilla latte with their house made almond milk and could not believe the flavor- it was so good, and only around $5, which is extremely reasonable for the high quality of the drink. I also had to try their house made dark chocolate, which was super tasty, and their house made pomegranate lime kombucha- also absolutely insanely good. I basically left this place with my mouth wide open, I was so blown away by the fact that they make so many things from scratch. I am so excited to come back here again soon."}
{"text":"There's not a single bad thing to say. This place is great! I had the spicy kofta tofu sandwich that came with a liberal serving of fries that were quite good. The latke was the lil small plate appetizer we got but if you get an order of fries, not a necessary acquisition. The latke was my least favorite part. My sister had the seitan shwarma which was incredible as well. The various soft drinks including the strawberry Italian soda I had were quite good as well.

Bottomline, great vegan food at a reasonable price. I also hear the truffles are great."}
{"text":"This place is probably good as a restaurant, but not the best coffee shop type atmosphere if you're looking to hang out and drink coffee or get some work done. The music is really loud and they want to seat you rather than just letting folks set up at a table. 

That being said, I got their vanilla flavored latte special and it was delicious...almost $6...but delicious. 

I will give this place another chance for a meal, but will probably go elsewhere when I want t hang out at a coffee shop."}
{"text":"I love Middle Eastern cuisine, but I usually think of it as being somewhat meat-centric. B52 Cafe is a unique, 100% vegan restaurant serving Middle Eastern classics like falafel, kibbeh, and moussaka. 

The menu is set up so you are free to order family-style mezze (small plates) or have a more traditionally structured meal with a starter and entree. Everything is perfect for sharing! 

The flatbread ($7) with tomato sauce, cashew cheese, and kalamata olives was seriously amazing. I was kind of wary of the cashew \"cheese,\" but it basically looks and tastes like a thick, creamy ricotta. You have to try this!

I had the fattoush (chopped salad with romaine, cucumber, olives, tomato, and mint; $7) and hummus with pita ($6). This combination was a perfect light dinner! Hummus is usually vegan anyway, so I shouldn't have been surprised that this version was delicious, served with fluffy, warm pita bread. I also tried a bite of the seitan kabob--very flavorful but not for the faint of heart! Make sure you like seitan (wheat gluten) or order the tofu option instead!

I'm not a huge fan of kombucha, but the kombucha they have on tap here almost converted me! The waitress was kind enough to let us sample the pomegranate lime and lemon turmeric flavors. 

Despite the lack of dairy and eggs, the desserts were delicious too! The frosting on the carrot cake was completely addicting. They also offer baklava and an assortment of dark chocolate truffles.

The atmosphere here is really relaxed and casual. I was seated at the communal table in the back. And the barstools are actually comfortable, which is hard to come by!

This is definitely a vegan restaurant you can bring your meat-loving friends to! If I lived in the area I would come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Some of the best vegan food that I have ever had. And they have kombucha!

First, let me start off by saying that the atmosphere of this place is really laid back - you sit pretty close to the tables next to you but it isn't too shabby. 

Our server was awesome. We went here on a Saturday night and had a crazy wait time for our food - it would have been easy to give this place a lower rating - but the way that our server handled the situation was amazing. 

I will definitely go back here, and recommend this place to anyone looking to have some great vegan food!"}
{"text":"Falafel balls are the BOMB. Vanilla coffee also wonderful. Had the chocolate cake and was amazed."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch shortly after they opened.  Hostess said our wait would be half and hour, ended up being more like 15 minutes.  The atmosphere is minimalist and rustic, while still maintaining a sense of warmth that's very inviting.  I was with my husband, who isn't crazy about \"weird, hippie food,\" and thus appropriately skeptical about this place, which holds itself out as a vegan/veg friendly establishment.

Well, he was pleasantly surprised!  From the coffee special (something amazing with homemade almond milk and orange essence) to the flat bread to the tofu scramble, everything we had was tasty, balanced, and well executed.  The service was attentive and helpful, and our waiter eagerly explained the things on the menu that we weren't familiar with.

All in all, this is a really unique new spot that is serving up some beautiful, delicious food in a lovely atmosphere.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I love trying new vegetarian/vegan places and this is one of the better ones! I always get the setain kabobs and they always are amazing. The atmosphere is a little dreary but the food makes up for it. I've tried the falafel salad and it was good but seemed like it need more flavor so I would recommend ordering some additional on the side."}
{"text":"Awesome food. It's great to have a tasty vegan option. I'm no vegan and it didn't feel like a compromise to eat here."}
{"text":"I love eating lunch here, the food is so fresh delicious and white. Everything is vegan. Are usually get a scramble or a sandwich and everything is always delicious. They have good chocolates and all sorts of desserts usually, again all vegan. 

Prices are OK, it's a little expensive for what it is, but the atmosphere is nice and it's a good place to take people got lunch. The chocolates are delicious!"}
{"text":"I am in love with B52 Cafe! They are kind of my new obsession! My husband and I ate at B52 Cafe last weekend for brunch. Everything we ordered was amazing! I love that they make so much of their food from scratch, it really shows in the quality and taste. My favorite is their cashew cheese! It is so nice to have a vegan/vegetarian restaurant use homemade cashew cheese and almond milk instead of soy products. If you're not a fan of soy like myself this place is the perfect alternative. Plus it just tastes so much better. 
The orange cinnamon vanilla latte is amazing! The homemade almond milk is a nice touch, it's super creamy and delicious! The deserts are great too! 
To top it off the food at B52 is so healthy. Not only does it taste good it's good for you. You won't feel guilty eating here!"}
{"text":"Always a fantastic meal at B52 - breakfast, lunch or dinner.  The labneh is worth a visit all on its own."}
{"text":"Unique takes on Mediterranean fare. Some of the dishes fail to match their non-vegan/vegetarian counterparts. The fresh house-made items are great quality and a blessing. Their chocolates are also unbelievable."}
{"text":"Finally made my way to B52 for brunch today. We had the falafel, sourdough pancakes and tofu scramble. All were delicious and we even had leftovers to take. I also want to add that neither me or my boyfriend are vegan, but we both very much enjoyed the vegan middle eastern fare at B52. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We were amazed . The mousaka , kabob seitan and French fries were outstanding 

Hummus was thick and delicious . The falafel was superb.

The cashew cheese flatbread was unappealing , tasteless and the cheese was a lump of sour mess 

The spanakopita is a big sour , vinegary let down...don't order it 

We hope to see an expanded menu"}
{"text":"B-52 café is very nice. They have a large selection of coffee and teas and fun drinks. The menu seems very small and basic but trust me it's good good food. Everything was super tasty. We had cashew butter wrap and a falafel wrap. We also had the lentil soup, it was topped with lemon zest and that made it super yummy. I had a vegan brownie for dessert, it was okay. I will go back and try other options on the menu."}
{"text":"For the record, I am not vegan.  I enjoy eating almost all kinds of food.  I came here with my family, some of whom are vegetarians, though not vegan.  The food was simply delicious.  A quick run-down.

We started with a shared 6 Mezze sampler.

1. The hummous was good.  I would not say amazing or particularly different, but very good.  Certainly better than the container hummous you get in the grocery store.  I make my own hummous and not trying to be immodest, but this was as good as mine.

2.  The Baba Ghanoush is really excellent.  It is much better than any that I have made.  It is smoky and has a perfect balance of eggplant and I assume garlic and tahini and lemon.

3.  We had a tomato and kale (?) dip that was delicious with Pita.

4.  The Falafel were really superb--lighter and more aromatic than most I have had--and I have eaten a lot of falafel in my life.

5.  The Labneh was a real surprise.  As this is a vegan restaurant, it was not dairy (it is usually like thick spiced greek yogurt/ cheese)--but rather seemed like it was made of a blended cashew butter.  

6.  The roasted cauliflower was good--just not super distinctive.

I did not sample everyone's meal, but I did try mine, and my wife's.

A.  My Seitan Shawarma Sandwich/Wrap was absolutely superb.  It was so delicious.  It was actually more delicious and juicy than any kind of Shawarma using Gyro meat I have ever had.  

B.  My wife had the Cashew \"Cheese\" sandwich/wrap.  It was surprisingly good - from a marketing perspective it doesn't sound great but the overall effect with the lettuce and spices is delightful.  I think that the Cashew Cheese was pretty similar to the Labneh.  

If you like Mediterranean food you will love this place.  If you are Vegan, you will love the fact that B-52 manages to satisfy both those who are looking for dishes that \"fake\" meat dishes, and dishes that celebrate meat free dairy free ingredients in their own right.

Go there, enjoy."}
{"text":"So unbelievably pleased with the service and food! Stopped here for brunch and got pancakes and yogurt- both of which exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere and delicious food. One of the only places where I feel like the BYOB policy works. 

Food is super flavorful and is generously portioned. I'm only giving four stars because there was some weird issue with the spinach pie that I ordered, and I ended up having to order a substitute meal to go because my friends had already finished their food. The substitute meal (seitan kabob) I ordered was FABULOUS, though. Will absolutely return."}
{"text":"Love B52! I could eat here all the time! Me and my husband will just stop by to pick up some of their delicious baked goods! My favorite dish is the Kofta Tofu Scramble. I actually crave it! The roasted cauliflower is one of my favorite \"appetizers\". The menu isn't huge, but you will love everything you try. Their specialty drinks are super good too! Just typing this review makes me want to go there and eat. Most important detail..everything is vegan!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and would deserve 5 stars, but it is just a little too pricey for what you get.  Always get a side of their Harissa and a latte. They are definitely one of the top vegans restaus in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This food is amazing. I eat lunch from b52 frequently and the vegan sataien wrappy is the best vegetarian wrap ive ever had! The food is absolutely delicious and extreamly healthy. The serving portions and very filling and the cost is reasonable. I would highly recommend this restaurant as one of my favorite vegetarian plugs in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"Great beverage selection. I got the housemade herbal tea blend and it was fantastic.  Also got an avocado toast and cashew almond yogurt which was amazing!  They had a lot of yummy desserts and homemade chocolates that were hard to pass up. Maybe next time.  They place is kind of rustic urban mix.  I almost missed the place cause i mainly saw the B and not the small 52 on the door.  If the place is marked anywhere other than the door it didn't stand  out to me.  Definitely worth coming to.  
It's not a good place to work or meet for business,cause the music was way too loud for that. Also the gals that work there seemed really nice when i walked in but then no one offered to take my order and when I asked if I could they made me feel like I was doing something wrong. Idk, it was silverware folding time of the day, maybe I was interrupting side work.
Still come here. It was great."}
{"text":"Nice smoky flavor on the baba.  Pita is warm and fresh.  Roasted cauliflower was yummy!  Flatbread was decent - mushroom and greens and the sesame and spices.  Nice atmosphere.  Would like to go back to try more offerings."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food, great service. Great ambiance. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but I would highly recommend to anyone! It seemed family friendly also"}
{"text":"An excellent Chef with a very creative menu. Everything on the menu is super tasty but I particularly love the fried tomatoes and the kabob dish. And the cashew cheese is amazing!  I always buy a pack of that to go.  Definitely one of my most favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Solid vegan cafe. All the food options we had were great but nothing was over the top spectacular. Their vegan treats are good as well. I would recommend the fried tomato as it was delicious. Nice vibe and decent service."}
{"text":"Spicy kofta tofu scramble with kale & pita chips. There is SO much flavor where its almost overwhelming. Really good stuff. Huge portion too, although the pita chips were too thick to use as chips, and too hard to break into smaller pieces. 

Potato-carrot-onion latkes was my favorite. Its like the next level hash brown with lots more ingredients and texture, all fried up. 

Avocado toast with black seasame was so simple yet so delicious. Chock full of the green mushy stuff yay!

Vegan brownie that tasted... very vegan. As in it was OK but the oil taste was apparent... possibly use more coffee or chocolate in their recipe?

Sampled their two kombucha of the day, where the the sour vinegar taste was very mild, well masked by the fruity accents. 

The overall vibe was very hipster, and service was attentive and welcoming. Good place for good vegan food."}
{"text":"Fresh perfect food, coffee, dessert and great space and staff are wonderful 

You must go, try the falafel sandwich omg so good!"}
{"text":"I was walking around Lawrenceville with a friend on Easter Sunday and lots of places were closed. The ones that were open, were packed and the wait time was out of this world. So we were strolling around and came across B52, which surprisingly could seat us straight away.
The place is quite small and cozy and they have lots of tables for 2. 

Our waiter was really nice and fun and explained the menu for us. We then decided to order a couple of things and share them between the two of us. For the drinks I ordered a normal coffee and a freshly squeezed orange juice. And for the food we had thick cut toast with almond spread and raspberry jam, the cashew cheese flat-bread and yogurt with compote.

I do have to say, that charging $3.5 for a kids glass of OJ is a bit outrageous. I get it, it's organic, it's fresh etc, but really. The portion size was also rather on the small side for the price. The taste, however, was amazing and I did enjoy all the items that we have ordered. 
All in all, I did enjoy my experience at B52. You can taste, that all the items on the menu are being prepared freshly, which is the reason I can look over the price in the end. 
It's definitely \"different\" and fresh, which is the reason I would definitely come back for another brunch/lunch."}
{"text":"There are not many places I can go to \"treat myself\" where I also feel like I'm doing my body a favor. This is one of them!
I am a huge fan of Mediterranean food, and this place does it right. I got the falafel salad with avocado, and it left me feeling replenished! The ingredients were fresh, the serving plentiful and I even had room for a vegan truffle afterwards! I can't wait to come back a try the mezze--house pita with tons of delicious dips to pair with it. I could live off that stuff. 
I would definitely recommend coming here for lunch, as the food is filling but won't slow you down midday! They also do carry-out. I have a great feeling that this spot will become one of my go-tos!"}
{"text":"An adored favorite. Excellent food, inviting atmosphere and staff, and reasonably priced. Vegan brunch, lunch, dinner, or takeout... can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegan but had an open mind when coming here. I got the kofta tofu scramble and was surprised about how much food they gave me! It was very good too - lots of flavor. I also got a coffee, which I wasn't too crazy about.

I went with about 10 other people and the waitress was very attentive and nice - she even split the bill without us even asking. Would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Good! Very impressive, but not fantastic. I know it must be hard to make an entirely vegan menu, and it really was original and yummy. There were a few things that I missed though. I had the seitan shwarmer which is like a middle eastern style seitan sandwich. It was very messy and the bread was so dry it was hard to eat. The flavors were very good however but a little plain. I was impressed by the vegan sauces. The staff was super friendly. I would return."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum, yum.  Everything we had was so flavorful and delicious.  And I'm not even a vegetarian!  Apparently, everyone - not just vegetarians and vegans - come to eat here because the food is so good.

- Pick 3 Mezze: fried cauliflower (my favorite of the three), Labneh (just okay in my opinion mostly because it wasn't as flavorful as anything else), baba gahnouj (pretty good)
- Moussaka (roasted eggplant, cherry tomatoes, kofta, seasonal vegetable, cashew cheese, saffron rice) - yuuuum
- Kabob (flame broiled seitan, onion, peppers, zucchini, yogurt cucumber salad, seasonal greens with beets, saffron rice) - again, yuuuum
- Carrot cake: Dense cake (yes!), cinnamony (I loved all the cinnamon but my dining companion thought it was on the verge of too much), frosting tasted really good - more like a buttercream than a cream cheese
- Maple spice latte: so creamy and delicious
- Cafe Rico (almond milk vanilla latte, orange zest, cinnamon): Refreshing flavor because of the citrus but it was one of those drinks where I kept taking sips trying to figure out if I liked it or not!  I only had a few sips since it wasn't actually my drink, so I never did figure out where I fell on the citrus-coffee combo!

Great atmosphere, friendly and patient service.  Even though we were still eating after closing time, no one made us feel rushed."}
{"text":"I love posting up at the bar with a pot of tea and lunch to get some work done. Great wifi, super friendly staff. Don't miss the brownies either."}
{"text":"Awesome flafel and humus! Labne is crushed cashew as they serve vegan diet so it's a totally different taste from Mediterranean/ m labne but it tastes good anyway. Cappuccino was not good at all!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is all vegan (including desserts) and tastes amazing. Their cauliflower is divine, no joke. Great cashew cheese flat bread, falafel salad... pretty much everything on the menu is great. The prices, service, and ambiance all are great as well. Will keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"The food and the place are exceptional but it is so very expensive. $36 (including tip) for breakfast for two on Sunday? My husband and son went yesterday and I was shocked at how much they paid. I do wish them success but I cannot afford to eat there!"}
{"text":"Not a vegan or vegetarian but I could eat here everyday. The cashew cheese is to die for and the sour dough pancakes are a must! I have only been for brunch, twice, but I hear there are doing dinner now! Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"The cashew cheese with the preservatives is amazing.  The coffee, fried tomatoes, fried cauliflower, and smoky eggplant spread were also delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, average prices. Menu is small which makes it easy to order, and there are some interesting dishes. Everything is fresh. We split the baba ganoush as an app, which was so good but kinda small for 3 people. I then had the falafel salad which was pretty yummy~ everything was crisp, fresh, and the dressing was light and pleasant. I feel like this would be a nice place for lunch or if you're dining with vegans"}
{"text":"Just can't ask for anything better than a vegan café with delicious food, amazing coffee & excellent friendly service.
When I walked in around 11 am on a weekday I was greeted with a smile and a choice of places to sit. The place was busy but there were still several empty tables. I had a seat at the counter.
I started with a café Rico latte...flavors of orange and cinnamon with house made almond milk...delicious! 
I wanted everything on the menu so it was very difficult to decide...I finally ordered avacado toast and lentil soup. There was a strong lemon theme with preserved lemon on the toast and chunks of fresh lemon in the soup...which I loved...so good! There was lots of avacado on the toast and the bread was the perfect blend of chewy and toasty. The soup was a great lentil soup and so bright with the bits if lemon as I mentioned.
It was such a treat to have a meal at B52 and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent! It was fresh, hot, and yummy! Coffee is good too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I enjoy nearly everything about this spot. This past weekend was my second time eating brunch here and it has all the elements of a vegan spot that I look for aka it is healthy, not too many meat substitutes are used, tons of variety in the menu, they don't overdo it on the salt, lots of veggies and also tons of baked goods offered. 

The avocado toast is super delicious-- really crispy yet chewy toast and then lemon tahini sauce on top creates an awesome combo. I have also had the tofu scramble both times I ate here, the portions is large, its adequately seasoned and is a full meal with sautéed kale and delicious latkes on the side. The pancakes are also massive and delicious so I have heard. As far as the beverages go they have that covered as well. When you order hot tea here they bring you a whole pot to yourself which I love. They also offer kombucha on draft, have nitro coffee which is dope, and tons of other specialty drinks. 

Service here has been really friendly and fast both times. The ambiance is pleasant and not too crunchy or hip, but more like a bright coffee shop/bakery inside. After I eat here I leave feeling satisfied, caffeinated, not overly stuffed and ready to take on my day in the Burgh. Excited to brunch here again when I visit next."}
{"text":"For a person respecting all living animals this place is the place to dine. FULL VEGAN menu with an assortment of options both classic vegan and Mediterranean. Service is on point and food is quick and tastes phenomenal. This is THE go to Vegan option in PGH. Keep it up B52!"}
{"text":"B52, I don't know how you guys did it. First time having a mock Kabob and wow it was sooooo tasty! Being that I'm Persian, I've had many kabobs in my life before going vegan. This made me skeptical but they definitely delivered an amazing veganized kabob. Also, the cucumber yogurt tasted just as good as any other dairy yogurt I've had, if not better knowing that it was cruelty and dairy free. The carrot cake was also delicious, I would have that cake on my birthday if I could. 

If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh I'll definitely make it a point to visit B52 again :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing quality food, service and venue. Even as a meat eater, I appreciated this food and my experience so much. Will come back many times and recommend it to others. Thank you, Omar!"}
{"text":"I've never been crazy about vegan food,  but this place changed my mind! I went here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by how good vegan food can be! I ordered the lavender latte with coconut milk, it was delicious. Then I got the falafel salad for lunch which was also delicious and filling. The salad was huge and had 4-5 falafels on it. I was so stuffed by the end of meal, I ended up taking half of the salad home!"}
{"text":"Hostess was unorganized. Sat people before us that had arrived after us. Waited an hour. Never were seated. Left. Unfortunate that they were rude and unorganized because I enjoy supporting vegan restaurants because of the ethical practices. Maybe they need to treat humans as well as they do animals."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I had the tofu scramble. I definitely will be back when I come back to PA. It was a great experience."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious and really cute spot. I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, but I really liked the menu items that are a break from the ordinary. The lentil lemon soup was so good, and will soon be a daily option. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Good place for vegetarians. Avocado toast is only available at weekends. Not ideal for meat lovers"}
{"text":"OK 1st, the BEST Falafel I have had in my entire life !!!! and the vegan options are amazing !!! and it is BYOB !!!

Went with a friend for lunch and this place was pretty packed,,,, UHHHHHH now I know why.  The food here is STELLAR !!!!

I have to say again, the Falafel is beyond amazing and I would have eaten a few dozen of them if I wanted to be gluttonous.  

The menu is brilliant and I totally recommend getting the 3 tastings of DIP w/warm pita.  OH MY... delicious.  They also have an array of fresh baked goods.

Honestly, I NEED to go back here; there is too much to try to make an informed review.

LOVED IT !!!  DELICIOUS !!  WILL be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to support a local vegan establishment but was met with a disorganized hostess that sat people that came in after my group before us and when we asked her about it, she was rude and dismissive.  Not a positive experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I had the spicy kofta tofu sandwich and added shaved seitan, and holy moly was it worth every. single. penny. The avocado spread on the toast is perfect and has a hint of lemon. Awesome coffee, awesome atmosphere, great service, I can't say more. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I will absolutely be eating here!"}
{"text":"I walked into this cool place with high expectations after reading many glowing 5 star reviews.  The neighborhood itself increased my expectations just walking up the street to B52.  We were sat right away and took a look at the menu.  The waiter explained a bit about the menu, and we ordered maple nitro cold brew coffees, the cauliflower mezze appetizer, falafel sandwich with soup, and kofta tofu wrap with french fries.

The French fries were awesome, easily the best I've had in years.  The kofta was the worst tasting thing I've had in recently memory (maybe it's an acquired taste?). A couple bites and that was all either of could stomach so we shared my falafel sandwich (which is actually a wrap.) The lentil soup was good, I liked the occasional taste of lemon.  The falafel wrap was also good.  The cauliflower tasted great (but salty) especially the dip that came with it.

The cold brew coffees were good but next time I will omit the maple. 

I was wavering between 3 or 4 stars thinking that perhaps my expectations were artificially high, but then I realized that after a while I started to feel self-conscious."}
{"text":"I've been here for both dinner and brunch and it's great.  The food is all wonderful and the service is friendly.  The space is tiny, but it's worth the wait.  Just give them your number and wander the adorable neighborhood."}
{"text":"My dog and I are currently Road Tripping... and we needed delicious, healthy vegan food  google searched for \"Vegan Restaurants Near Me\" and saw how many 5 star reviews this place had... knew immediately where we were eating dinner 

I got their \"MOUSSAKA\" and it was mind blowing and DELICIOUS. More than I could have ever hoped for.

I've been vegan for 2 years and this was top 3 most delicious vegan meals I've had to date.

I look forward to coming back to Pittsburgh to experience this vegan  taste bud paradise   again! Thanks to all who made this happen! I'm so very grateful for B52"}
{"text":"Expect to be served top quality food here. Every single menu item is cooked to perfection, delicious flavors, and always consistent. I've never been served a bad meal here. Breakfast is my favorite; portions are massive! The tofu scramble with the seitan is definitely a crowd favorite-huge portion, amazing flavor, so filling, and zero regret. Do not forget to use their house-made Harissa sauce--perfectly spicy! Also do not pass up on a drink. They make a ton of in-house drinks (truly everything is made in-house, from scratch). I've had the best vanilla lattes from here; made with homemade nut milk and chunks of fresh vanilla bean. Also they rotate different in-house kombucha flavors which are also always delicious. Can't wait to see what other menu items evolve and can't wait until my next visit. Oh don't leave without grabbing a sweet treat to go. Everything is vegan. The owner also owns Allegro Hearth Bakery on Murray Ave in squirrel Hill; if you haven't been yet, get there soon! Traditional, simple, delicious European style bread."}
{"text":"Delicious food whether you're strictly veggies or used to eating meat, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"B52 is so good...
I wanted to try everything on the menu, alphabetically - but I couldn't decide which alphabet to use. The environment is so charming and the staff so warm and sunny, I had to wear shades... literally, literally .

B52 is an excitedly welcome kind and gentle addition to the community that reaffirms that we are, indeed, the City of Champions!

Huzzah!"}
{"text":"Found this lil gem on a whim. 
Had an appointment up the street,afriend and I wanted to grab a bite 
Not a vegan but not opposed to tasty food...

Yummmm 
Avocado toast was super tasty. Def would get again 
Also enjoyed the maple spice latte (obviously seasonal)
My friend had a scramble don't remember which but it was delicious it had kale and it blended with the other ingredients seamlessly 
Loved the atmosphere. Cute cafe with a decent amount of space. Private feel in public. 

Waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive. 
Fast service and delicious food. 
Glad we stumbled upon the b52"}
{"text":"B52 is a beautiful, open, naturally lit space in the heart of upper Lawrenceville that serves delicious middle eastern vegan food and homemade chocolate truffles.

Their falafel sandwich is my favorite in the city!  The portion is very generous for $8, and it comes with pickled turnips (mmm!  so good) and slaw. The flavor packs a zesty, citrusy zing.  It tastes so fresh and healthy and yet is so filling. Get this with the harissa sauce for a little extra flavor and a spicy kick!

The moussaka is also out of this world good -- frankly, more flavorful and delicious than the best meat moussaka I've had in the city. That's quite a feat. Seriously, get this. It comes with deliciously seasoned rice (to which I added some harissa sauce, too) topped with toasted almonds and perfectly cooked green beans and beets, too.

I've also tried the tofu scramble and found the texture to be spot-on but the flavor to be quite bland.  Perhaps I will try the kofta tofu scramble, which sounds more flavorful, next time.

Finally, don't overlook their truffles!  They are sooo tasty.  I love my chocolate fairly dark, and their truffles are a lot less cloyingly sweet than most others I have had.  Some are more inventive than others (my favorite flavors are the creative cardamom espresso, and the relatively more familiar peanut butter).  Just try them!  They are delicious.

I have only ever gotten takeout from here, but the space is beautiful and I look forward to dining in for brunch sometime soon.  The staff has always been nothing short of pleasant and accommodating.

What a pleasant surprise for a meat-lover like myself!"}
{"text":"I like the space, I like the location, I like the menu. The staff are nice too. 

For a place like this in PGH, it's probably hard to justify the pricing. If it's all organic & hand crafted food....people should be happy to pay. 

Portions are big, food is tasty & ordering is pretty fast I think. 

The only negatives for me personally are: 1- price is a bit much on certain items 2 - there is a LOT of oil in a lot of the food. The wraps for instance are yummy but they literally DRIP with oil. 

Seitan is good. Salad is good. Tofu is good...no complaints from this vegan couple."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious almond mylk for amazing coffee drinks. 
as a vegan coffee snob I'm happy to get the straight black offerings of the local expert coffee bars. however, I like the fancy drinks, too, and had written them off as they are often not vegan and it's a bit of a trouble to ask. not here! everything is v'kosher and delicious!

i'd almost given up on eating out, with the exception of Amazing Cafe. 
but, I can't make this at home! 
our family shared the Mezza 6 and it lit us up with a rare excitement -- like the first time trying Cafe Gratitude or Gracias Madre in SF. 
B52 is like a cross between SF and Detroit -- super fresh ingredients with the smokey and rich depth of authentic Middle Eastern cuisine. 
A must try for anyone."}
{"text":"I went here today for such with wife and some friends.
Its is a vegan style resteraunt.
I started with a bowl of lentil soup which was delicious.
I then had a house salad which was also very good.
Then onto some potato latkes which where also very good.
The place is a little on the small side so not a lot of customers can fit at one time but we managed.
We where a party of 4 and where seated immediately and the server was very nice and very friendly.
The food was overall very good and also fresh.
I have to admit it generally is not the kind of food I would go for but I would recommend The b52 cafe if you are int h area."}
{"text":"A good vegan lunch! My boyfriend and I came here at 2pm on a Saturday for a late lunch. We had the almond butter toast topped with raspberry preserves, the kofta tofu scramble with complimentary tahini sauce, the falafel wrap, a side of latkes (shredded potatoes, carrots, and onion), and a side of fries. This was more than enough food for two people. 

Almond butter toast was very good (no complaints). Kofta tofu scramble didn't meet my expectations in terms of taste, but the sauce it came with (along with the tahini I added) saved it from being just mediocre. Definitely could've used more sauce though. My boyfriend did not like the falafel wrap and said there wasn't enough falafel, but I thought it was pretty good. The latkes were oily, but we really enjoyed them. The fries came in a large portion, which is always a good thing. 

Loved the tahini sauce. It tasted great on everything we got!

{"text":"I brought my family here for Father's Day for the Sunday Brunch. The space does not have a lot of tables and is very small so we had to wait about 40min to get a table, but once we did it was well worth it. I ordered the Kofta tofu scrambler with added shiitake mushrooms and potatoes on the side. I was very impressed with the taste and the quality. I am not vegan so I wasn't sure what to expect but since my father is a vegetarian I decided to try something new. The spicy sauce they serve with it is delicious. I also had the pomegranate kombucha drink which was also fresh and tasty. I would definitely come back here for Sunday brunch on my own again."}
{"text":"As it seems that the trend for more vegetarian and vegan cafes seems to be picking up, B52 is a cute little addition to Lawrenceville.  I met friends for brunch, and luckily we went early (10am) because by 11:00 the seating was all filled up.  After a morning run, I chose the hearty kofta-tofu scramble, and was not disappointed. I am not vegan, nor a vegetarian, but the flavors of this dish were just as good as many eggs and sausage dishes I've tried.  The most noticeable thing about the dish was the size...it was easily a double portion, and I took home the other half...which made my Monday morning quite nice ;)  My friends ordered the granola parfait and the pancake, and my meal was definitely the biggest portion. The granola parfait was noticeably small, but went great when paired with another food item.  Unfortunately, the sweet side of my meal wasn't quite as good as the savory.  My friend and I both ordered cinnamon rolls, which looked amazing presented in the glass serving dish on the counter.  Our waitress brought them to us warm, and with the icing melted on top we were really excited for a brunch splurge.  So it was a little disappointing when all I could think about was how I needed a glass of milk to wash it down...or better yet, dunk it!  The pastry was so dry, and I kept thinking...maybe it just needs...some eggs?  Milk?  Not sure, but it just wasn't what I was hoping it would be.  The cinnamon swirl was flavorful and would have been delicious if I was eating a scone...but a cinnamon roll is supposed to be soft, gew-y and doughy...and this one was not.  So my take-home message is this....if you like the hipster vibe of Lawrenceville, B52 Cafe will feel right at home.  Get the scramble, skip the cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"I wanted to get some coffee and enjoy the lovely Pittsburgh day after my hair appointment at Metamorphosis. I walked a few blocks down to B52 and ended up grabbing a seat at the bar and enjoying a nice lunch, too. 

I am not vegan but I am trying to incorporate more vegan/veg meals into my lifestyle. So I am excited for this place because they have a lot of new things for me to try and at a reasonable price! From the moment I walked in everyone was super friendly. Though about three people were tending to me, so I'm not exactly sure who I was tipping! But they were all fantastic. 

Almost all of the tables were taken on a Saturday at Noon. I opted for a spot at the counter area. I ordered the falafel wrap and it was so good. The homemade wrap itself was slightly dry but the falafel inside was cooked to perfection. The Mediterranean slaw was so good... my first time ever having pickled beets but they were good, too. I opted for a side of fries (total $11) and I'm glad I did because, heaven. 

I normally only like flavored coffee drinks, unless the coffee itself is really good. I got the vanilla latte ($5.25) and wow.... spectacular. Just the right amount of flavor and you can tell the coffee was high quality. 

Excited to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"The portions we so nice and mezza platter perfect way to sample everything.  Nice atmosphere and really good vegan food."}
{"text":"Went here this evening for an early dinner with a vegan friend who was in from out of town. The food was good but I was surprised at how the server treated our menu selection. She did ask if we had other allergies and I mentioned that I'm gluten free. She said they have an awesome gluten free flat bread that can accompany the mezzo plates (tapas style middle eastern dips- we had the baba, labneh, and fried tomatoes (which didn't seem fried, they were more like stewed tomatoes on a plate with extremely spicy wasabi) 

I asked if I could also get a piece of toast from their menu but on the gluten free bread. The waitress said \"no we don't do that because we don't think it tastes good with that portion of the menu\" it wasn't a \"let me see about it\" or anything, just flat no. 
I truly cannot imagine why someone else would tell me what they think I would prefer to eat based on their taste palate. It's a local cafe type of restaurant, not anything super upscale where you'd expect it to be a hard set menu. If I'm willing to pay extra to adhere to my allergies, I can't imagine why they wouldn't want to accommodate that. 

The bread they did bring out that was gluten free was really good and I imagine it would have been amazing as toast! It seemed like a type of pumpernickel with sesame seeds. I was surprised at how small the portion was (four pieces about one inch by four inches to eat three plates of dip with. She did bring pita for my non-gluten free friend in abundance but I was expecting more than what I got since I was the one who ordered it). I'm so so about whether I'd go back mostly because of the customer service - not because of the food!"}
{"text":"2/20/28 took a good friend here for the masooka but it turns out that it's only on the dinner menu 

We found lots of other things to try and she fell in love with the place.  

The last time I was there was for dinner and the waiter immediately asked and checked if the table wabbled and fixed it with a match book!  Hey, it's not a black napkin but still caring and impressive.

Today the table wabbled and when I brought it to the waitresses attention she gave me some lame excuse about not having matchbooks.  My friend suggested changing our table and the waitress was happy not to have to do anything on her part. 

Finally, we both bought containers of the baba to take home because it's the best....well I'm here to say that the flavor is greatly lacking in what they sell in the take out.  So keep this in mind...order a fresh order to take home ($7.50) and if you get the same waitress we had... hold your ground when she gives you some rumdum excuse to try to get you to adjust your order."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS! I was in Pittsburgh visiting and had no clue where to find good vegan/vegetarian food, I looked on yelp and decided B52 is where I should go based on previous reviews... 

From the moment I walked in I could tell this place was going to be good. After asking the server what he suggested I figured I'd get the falafel sandwich with the soup of the day, which I was so lucky it was my favorite: LENTIL SOUP... now I've had lentil soup hundreds of times (seriously) the moment I had my first spoonful I was like \"HOLY S*%^\" it was the best lentil soup no the best soup I've ever had in my life period. The falafel sandwich was also soooo delicious! 

My favorite part aside from the amazing food would definitely be the customer service, my server was amazing and super helpful, the barista was also awesome and really fun to talk to, but the OWNER-OMAR stopped by my table and had a genuine conversation with me and truly wanted to know what I thought of the food and was just so amazing! 

I will be making B52 a regular part of my routine whenever I'm in Pittsburgh and you should to!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my niece and boyfriend.  There was a little bit of a wait, but they were really nice and tried to accommodate everyone quickly.

We probably over ordered as everything on the menu looked good.  I feel like I should preface this by saying i'm not vegan or vegetarian.  My niece, who is 15, is debating whether she wants to become a vegetarian, so we like to occasionally take her to new places that she can try out.  B52 was a huge win on that front for all three of us.   This place was delicious.  I'd give it more than 5 stars if possible.

My boyfriend ordered the falafel sandwich. I have to echo other reviewers here, it was one of the best falafel sandwiches that I've tried.  It's crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside, with great flavor.  I ordered the avocado toast, which was delicious.  My niece ordered the Za'atar flat bread.  I tried and it really liked it.  I think she ordered it not quite understanding that it's not going to have  red sauce.  She thought it was a little dry.  We also ordered the mezze taste 3.  We got the Hummus, Fried tomatoes, and Baba Ghanouj.  I can not recommend getting the baba ghanouj enough. It was the best thing that I ate that day.  The smoked eggplant was phenomenal.  The fried tomatoes were a close second.  the hummus was also delicious.  I would have scraped the bowls clean if I wasn't sharing with two other people.

My niece and I had the house made sodas which were also a real treat,  They were really good.

This is a great spot.   It's definitely a must stop if you're in the Lawerenceville area."}
{"text":"Such a cool café with super friendly staff, a killer espresso bar, and delicious bites. They have just the right size menu for a little city spot that focuses on their beverages and to-go goods. I always like to see places that do a few things really well rather than try to offer too much and sacrifice quality. 

Stopped in for breakfast on a Friday morning. Had a cappuccino and tried the tofu scramble + almond butter toast + cashew cheese toast. Everything was amazing. You can tell these guys work really hard to put out great products made from scratch. Two thumbs way up."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to eating here for quite some time. When I arrived around the noon hour the place was virtually empty. I saw on the chalkboard a menu sign where you can order or asked to be seated. I choose the latter.

A nice, friendly, and helpful waitress gave me a menu and helped me interpret what I wanted to eat. Breakfast ended at 11 so that will be on a future visit. The menu has items on it that can be served all day such as \"mezze\" which is a choice of dip(s) with pita or thick cut toast served with various toppings.

Since this place is entirely vegan I opted for the falafel sandwich and a small plate of mujadara. Sandwiches can be paired as a lunch combo with your choice of soup, salad, or fries for $12.00.

When I was asked for a beverage I was disappointed to learn that they don't offer ice tea but they can take any tea your order and serve it with a cup of ice to cool it. I opted for the half pot of gunpowder green tea. It is served in a pot with a small glass and was ok just as it was.

The mujadara is made with basmati rice, green lentils, onions, and Tahini yogurt sauce. I received that small plate first and it was out of this world delicious! My falafel came with a homemade wrap. It consisted of Mediterranean slaw, chick peas, pickled turnips, preserved lemons, and Tahini sauce. This wrap was so big I had to cut it just to eat it. Loved it but it was a little messy. To me as long as it tastes good I don't care about it being messy.

I got to chat a little with the folks at the next table. One of them ordered the Shiitake mushroom flatbread AKA Manakish. it looked like a 6 cut pizza. He offered me a small slice to try and that too was out of this world good!

I was stuffed with my meal when my waitress went over the dessert menu. They serve various cookies and brownies along with homemade truffles made with various fillings. I decided to hold off for now until a future visit.

Prices here are very reasonable. You definitely can get a nourishing and healthy lunch here. My waitress told me as I was leaving that they do offer brunch on Sat and Suns only since they are open until 3. I will keep that in mind for a future visit.

B52 is a small restaurant located in Upper Lawrenceville. It sits next door to a bank so it isn't hard to miss while driving up that way. I was extremely pleased with my visit and have it on my bucket list to return to try their other offerings. Upon request I was given a take out menu to help me plan a future visit."}
{"text":"This place was sort of disappointing.  They had more on their menu for vegans than just having to throw together a bunch of sides and veggies, so I was initially pumped.  I ordered the tofu scramble with brussel sprouts and even my meat ending friend was confused.  Everything was cool properly and seasoned well, but the tofu...and it was cubed like in Thai food.  Super confusing.  The coffee was killer but the food was just meh.  I'll give it another shot...but I really don't see what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"I love this place. The menu is creative and delicious. The space feels comfortable. And the service is patient and kind. One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were there on a Saturday afternoon recently for our first visit.  We loved it and are looking forward to going back and ordering something new! We did have to wait a short time in line, but we didn't care, which is unusual for us. We were just excited to be there, and the vibe in the place is very good! We wanted to order most things on the menu, but settled on lattes and wraps. She the tofu scramble, and I got a Seitan \"steak\" like wrap.  We enjoyed and shared both, and only finished half of each.  The tofu scramble had a hint of spicy flavor, and everything blended together well, I didn't want to give it back to her, even though my wrap was like a \"steak um\". Very enjoyable. Loved the whole vibe of the place, its tight in there which we also don't usually like, but in here it didn't matter.  Lots of fun, and I am still full hours later as I write this review! We will be BACK! We have already told others about this GEM! VEGAN NATION!"}
{"text":"Vegan or not, B52 is a must try! I dragged my steak-loving friend here for lunch and he was surprisingly in love with the food.  It was my first visit and needless to say, I think I'm already obsessed. Definitely one of the best vegan restaurants I've been to in Pittsburgh.

I stopped in during the lunch rush. With the small space and limited seating, we would have had a bit of wait, but luckily, there were open spots at the bar. Service was fantastic from start to finish. We were promptly greeted by our waitress who was friendly and helpful throughout the meal - amazing all around!

The menu takes middle eastern cuisine and gives it a unique flare. Some items and combos may sound a bit odd, but they surprisingly work. I ordered the koftka tofu scramble which came with wilted kale, eggs, and a seitan/tofu mix. Highly recommend! Not only was it delicious but the portion was huge so you're sure to be satisfied afterwards. The seitan/tofu had the consistency of ground beef and was seasoned very well but not too overpowering. To satisfy my sweet tooth, I had the almond cashew yogurt which was essentially a yogurt parfait. Simple but still delicious.

Although vegan food has a bad reputation, B52 definitely raises the bar. This is a great lunch or dinner option for vegans and even non-vegans. If I could come here for every meal, I would be the happiest veghead on the planet."}
{"text":"Super yummy vegan food! Such a cute little place! The staff is also great and friendly! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! 

Came here on a Saturday morning around 11AM. We were immediately seated and served. My friend and I decided to share everything. We ordered avocado toast, a cashew cheese flatbread and blueberry sourdough buckwheat pancakes. 

Our waitress was super attentive and the food came out so quickly. The avocado toast was perfect: crunchy toast, creamy avocado and lemony tahini sauce. We loved how fresh it tasted! 

The cashew cheese flatbread was also delicious. The tomato sauce was very fresh and the olives gave a great salty bite. The cashew cheese was tangy and creamy. The flatbread was everything! 
We ended our meal with the pancakes. They were sweet and delicious. A little difficult to cut into because of the buckwheat but still amazing. They were light and airy. 

On our way out, I bought a cookie to go while my friend bought a cinnamon roll. Both were delicious! B52 is a great place!!"}
{"text":"I just love it here. It's consistently delicious with friendly service. That's really what makes 5 stars for me. I come here at least on a monthly basis, if not more. It's just such a great environment, I can't help myself!

It's all vegan... And while I'm not vegan myself, it doesn't matter! You don't need meat or dairy to have excellent food in my opinion. Everything I've had has been fantastic. I especially love 5 different \"mezze\" dishes you can pick 1, 3 or all 6 of for a deal. You can go with either hummus, fried cauliflower, baba ghanouj, fried tomatoes, falafel or labneh. I always get the cauli (it comes with this insanely good dipping sauce), baba and fried tomatoes. It also comes with fresh pita bread to dip or just eat plain. Great for sharing or if you want to try a variety of items. 

I also love the Falafel salad. While the falafel is good, I also can't get enough of the pickled turnips, which they actually sell sometimes as a grab and go item. You also can't go wrong with any of their homemade sodas or coffee bar drinks. Every time I come I can't just get a plain water. I have to get the featured drink. 

I still haven't trued their brunch, which I'm excited to check out sometime. I have NO doubt it will be sometime soon. Speaking of which, you should also get there soon..."}
{"text":"Really awesome experience. Great vegan food, especially the falafel (yes, of course, it's vegan naturally) but so tasty and done right! Thanks, Omar, wishing you much success."}
{"text":"I came upon this place by mistake through NoWait. I'm happy I did. I just had a coffee and cinnamon roll, but both were excellent. Vegan baked goods can tend to be dry, but they seem to clearly understand maintaining moisture content in their baked goods. It's a beautifully redone building with a tasteful mixture or traditional tin ceilings and woodwork with modern lighting and finishes. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I would recommend this place for vegans and their carnivorous friends ;-)"}
{"text":"This place is not just a great vegan restaurant, it's a great restaurant. Period.

My husband and I have been vegan for 6 years; and the veggie scene in Pittsburgh is getting so exciting. The first time I came to B52, no one even told me it was vegan. My friend just told me that it was Mediterranean; which was totally cool, because I knew that I could at least get hummus and veggies. But when I saw the menu, I died of sheer joy. I could eat EVERYTHING!!! 

To my pleasant surprise, the owner is also the head chef, and runs the kitchen; not just someone who saw a great location and wanted to capitalize on real estate and pander to the demographic. Meaning, the food is MADE with love, care, and attention to detail. Not frozen food simply heated up and assembled.

They make everything IN-HOUSE. Their almond milk, hummus, cashew \"cream\" cheese, and baked goods. At this point, I have tried everything on the menu, and have NEVER been disappointed.

During Sunday Brunch, if you get there right at 9am, you'll get seated right away. However, the place is also a small café, so groups larger than 4 may have to wait even longer. The place also fills up quick. BUT - worth the wait for the Sourdough Buckwheat Pancakes, which we always get with Blueberries (or you can add bananas, or both). My husband and I always tend to split the Tofu Scramble as well, to satisfy our savory side. Whatever they do to their scrambled tofu is pure magic. The Latkes are also better than any of our old family recipes (but PLEASE do not tell that to my Aunts and Great-Aunts - they might keel over).
Also, even if you just go for a coffee (Café Rico - hot - is totally worth a try!!) and Thick Cut Toast, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how full you may be. 

For lunch - anything on the menu is totally awesome. But the Falafel or Seitan Schwarma sanwiches (with Fries - TOTALLY get the fries!!!) are tied for my favorites. Ever since Station Street Hot Dogs disappeared, I couldn't find a worthy falafel contender. But this falafel is better than anything I've had anywhere. Again - don't tell my Aunts that. 

Dinner starts at 5pm, and you can't go wrong with a Mezze platter, flatbread, or entree. No matter what I have tried - I roll my eyes back into my head and think, \"How do they do it?!\"

Desserts - pick ANY of them. And if you don't say, \"this isn't vegan?!\" then you can call me any dirty name that you want to. Seriously. My favorites are the Cinnamon Roll and Baklava, but the cookies and brownies are worth sharing as they are dense and delicious. I'm not sharing my Cinnamon Roll though. Get you're own. 

They also have a quick Grab and Go section at the front to take home any of their great items. We have taken some cashew cheese, hummus, and pitas with us on road trips or for a picnic in the park, and it's the perfect snack to keep us going.

On top of the great food, and friendly staff, B52 always seems to be playing kick ass music as well. My husband and I joke that B52 feeds both our stomachs and our souls, as we are usually SoundHounding what's playing through the speakers. Our favorite find - Os Mutantes \"A Mehia Menina\" - 60's Brazilian Pop Song. Super fun and catchy.

Overall, B52 has replaced the hole in our hearts that Quiet Storm left. Yet, in letting any old things go, you make room for the better."}
{"text":"I came here for supper but I hope I end up going back sometime earlier in the day. B52 has the standard cafe equipment and high end coffee that certainly are worth returning for. I didn't have any but apparently their floral lattes are a thing. They also stock the good pita, humus, and some other Middle Eastern staples. I wish I had tried more of them. 

I ordered moussaka which was loosely interpreted by layering eggplant, a seitan/tomato sauce, eggplant and cashew cheese. Not the square cut from the pan you get a a greek diner but this was far superior. At first I was a little freaked out how closely their seitan approximated a meat sauce. The cashew cheese is really something I feel like I have only ever had like that at this restaurant. Tangy and thick, very similar to a dairy soft cheese. Had I not been traveling without a place to refrigerate it I would have most certainly purchased some to take home with me. 

The meal also included broccoli, saffron rice, and beats. I ordered a pot of tea with it and two house made chocolates at the end. I ate my meal at the bar which was a little cramped but there was a larger communal table I could have moved to if it was more of an imposition. 

The service was prompt and the price seemed just right given the product and location quality. The meal here made my night."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than B52, folks. This is, hands down, my fave spot in Pittsburgh. 

I've had almost everything on the menu, but my absolute loves? Seitan Shwarma, the thinnest-sliced seitan and crunchy pickled turnips make for a filling and flavorful sandwich. The Cashew Cheese flatbread, a smooth and creamy cruelty-free cheese, and at 7 bucks, a great value. Oh, and of course, the fried cauliflower = amazing. I promise you'll gobble it up like you've never gobbled a veggie before.

Not to mention the full coffee bar (including nitro coffee!) and delicious baked goods. I'm def partial to the Café Rico and the brownie as my after-meal follow-up. And the house made sodas? So refreshing.

Thanks, B52, for providing inventive and creative vegan foods options."}
{"text":"What happens when a carnivore walks in to a vegan café? Surprisingly, he gets full despite expectations! The 6-item mezze sampler is expensive, but fresh 'n filling. BYOB to increase the fun factor."}
{"text":"Awesome experience ,awesome food. Started off with lentil soup which was perfect. Had the falafel sammy/wrap which was super tasty and filling. Vegan fries were fresh cut, crispy and perfect. Avacado toast was super sized and made perfectly . Also had a maple nitro cold brew coffee that was super smooth . All around a great experience . Would definitely go back and tell everyone to give it a try."}
{"text":"After a few visits, I have enjoyed all they have offered. The kombucha, tea, and dinner was delicious. Their hummus is great!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for the weekend, and my son and I decided to try this place for breakfast based on the great reviews, and I'm glad we did! 
I had the kafta tofu scramble. The spicy sauce on the side was just the right touch to push the dish from good to great, if you like a little heat. If not, then you'll probably want to skip the sauce, but it was perfect for me. 
My son had the blueberry pancakes. They were soooooo good. He devoured them both and they were HUGE! 
We also got a carry out for some other people that couldn't join us for breakfast. The zatar and onion flatbreads were delicious. Chewy, thin, warm bread with the right amount of toppings. The labneh was good too. As for desserts, the cookies are out-of-this-world good. Even non-vegans said they were the best chocolate chunk cookies they've ever had. 
The only thing I didn't enjoy was the brewed coffee. It was VERY acidic and upset my stomach drinking it before the meal came (on an empty stomach). So if you don't like acidic coffee, try a latte or some chai :)
All in all, excellent food. I wish we had one of these in Detroit - our vegan breakfast restaurants don't have as good of food as this place!!"}
