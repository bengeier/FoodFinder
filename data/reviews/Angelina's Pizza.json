{"text":"We have pizza delivered at least once a week and love our pizza night with this pizza. Best sauce and toppings and they are generous with topping unlike the other pizza joints in the area. great flavor and fast service! Will not order from any other place!  LOVE IT! Btw, we order from the North Ridgeville location."}
{"text":"Great pizza, if you can get them to sell it to you. Called at 8:55 to place pick up order. Took our order and asked when we would get it. Said we would be there in 20 min, pretty standard time to pick up a pizza. We were told they would be closed at nine. We said ok, but you will be there cleaning up and we can pick up. They said no, that we needed to be there before nine. Confused as to why they took the order to begin with. Cancelled our order and asked for the name of another pizza shop in town and was told they couldn't do that.  Great pizza, bad service."}
{"text":"They gave us a welcome the neighborhood coupon when we moved in and now I am hooked. Their pizza is very good, and I love that they sell their dough for make it your own pizza nights. The pizza was high quality, good toppings, and the salad was great. The only reason they are getting 4 stars is I did not like their wings. I prefer non-breaded wings so they were a little soggy in my opinion, however, the flavor was great. They are a little pricey (but all takeout pizza places are in my opinion) and delivery was a little slow, but that's how you know it's being made fresh.   We order from here often now."}
{"text":"So, in my opinion, I would say skip this place. The pizza is ok, but for the money, I've had better. They seem to have issues honoring deals. I stopped in for the pizza by the slice deal that they had posted on a community facebook page as part of an evening community event. The staff looked completely unaware and stated they just weren't doing that. They never seem to run specials, and always seem annoyed with you when asked."}
{"text":"Never will i order from this place again!! Food was horrible! After waiting an hour for my food to be delivered.Not to mention I called to check on my order bc it was taking to long ..  my order was delivered  the food was cold and tasteless ! I was completely unsatisfied so i decided to call and request to speak with a manager.Even worst !! The girl was rude.rude.rude! Didnt even apologize !Dont waste your money!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and pasta at pretty good prices.  They do pizza by the slice at the restaurant, and they have take-out/delivery family style pasta meals that are great if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"My Favorite Pan Pizza in NE Ohio!  I love everything about this Pizza! The sauce is rich and sweet. Quality toppings and cheese applied generously (especially love their meatballs). The crimped outer crust looks great and tastes even better being flavorful with a perfect chew. Their House Special is my favorite - sausage, mushrooms, onions, and those awesome mini meatballs."}
{"text":"This is definitely really good pizza as long as you don't mind a kind of sweet sauce! The workers are very polite and the 4 buck lunch deal is such a steal! Oh and the cheese on the pizza is to die for!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Greek salad and added a chicken breast...possibly the grossest salad I have ever had...it came out cold,pre-packaged, chicken included. The chicken must have been a JTM because it wasn't a \"real\" chicken breast (think McDonald's processed chicken). My husband and kids had the pizza, which albeit greasy, was pretty good."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. We will be ordering from here again very soon. Taste like a true authentic pie."}
{"text":"Having traveled to the Olmsted area 6-8 times per year for business for the last 10 years, I've enjoyed Angelina's pizza numerous times.  It's our 'go to' spot when catering for shift training meetings.  The pizza is always delivered hot and on-time.  The ingredients are fresh and they will build for you whatever combination you want.  My personal favorite is the Italian sausage and onion pizza with extra cheese, although the extra peperoni pizza is pretty high on my list as well.   I'm getting hungry just writing this review!"}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious!  For you pizza-eaters who like a crimped buttery crust and a sweet pizza sauce, you won't be disappointed!  From Indianapolis but whenever we come to Cleveland, we order a cheese pizza with extra cheese.  Our receipt said 2x provolone  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten Angelina's pizza for many years and have always found them to be delicious.  Their consistency is their key to success Ever wonder why every time you order a pizza it's different? Angelina follows the same recipes every time right down the water. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Sauce is a bit sweet/basil tasting. A bit pricey, but worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Make your own Pasta Meal\". I chose Rigatoni with marinara sauce even though I wanted meat sauce and they don't offer such an item. I opted for meatballs with the marinara sauce instead. SpaceThis meal comes with a side salad and a breadstick. When I arrive to pick it up the salad was tiny and warm sitting on their warmer waiting for pick up. I open the bag and said where is the pasta and breadstick?  I had to wait for them to prepare the pasta with meatballs even though I had ordered a half hour earlier. I took my meal home and when I opened it I was so disappointed the breadstick was as hard as a rock the salad was warm and the meatballs are not homemade they're frozen! Next time I have to say I will order from Mateo's or Jo Jo Carloni's here in town. Very disappointment!"}
{"text":"The Search continues for the best pizza in Cleveland. I ordered over the phone and gotta say I didn't speak to the brightest bulb in the pack.  When she called back to confirm the address, she asked for my phone number again.  Seriously?  Did you not just dial it?  Are you not speaking to me?  Again?  I opted to pick it up in fear of the driver getting miserably lost. Same basic pizza.  Cheese & Pepperoni.   Outcome: we got good pizza.  Not enough cheese, pretty skimpy here.  Decent pie, just not fabulous. Searching......"}
{"text":"It was fast and simple i did carry out pizza was hot and tasted great i will be eating there again"}
{"text":"I wanted to give NEGATIVE stars, but this site won't LET me.   I TRIED to order some food from Angelina's online tonight.  I was CHARGED, TWICE, yet received NO food!  To make matters worse; the RUDE, SO-CALLED \"manager\" wanted to ARGUE with me, and tried to tell me that I wasn't charged, and I told HER that my CREDIT CARD COMPANY said that I WAS charged, TWICE.  SO, NOW, because of Angelina's Pizza charging me TWICE and giving me NO food, I have NO credit left on my credit card to get food from a GOOD restaurant!!!!!!!!!!  Thanks a LOT Angelina's Pizza for making me GO WITHOUT FOOD for a couple of days (seeing as you charged me TWICE!)!!!  GRRR!!!   ADDED 11/27/2016:  Katie Huber, the (SUPPOSED) \"manager\" of Angelina's, has decided to STALK me on Facebook!    She KNEW I was right, so she ATTACKED me in a PM!  How SAD for her!  She CHEATS people to the point they will have NOTHING to eat for a WEEK, and then ATTACKS  them on Facebook.  Oh, and GET THIS: this \"manager\" NOW says that SHE actually charged me THREE times, but STILL wants to blame it on my CREDIT CARD company instead of taking responsibility for HER mistake!!!!!!!!!!   Added 12/5/2016, after reading the TOTALLY MADE UP \"copy\" of the conversation between myself and the STALKING \"manager\" of Angelina's...As you can see, these people do NOT want to TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for THEIR mistakes, AND they want to STALK people.  It got SO bad, that I had to REPORT that \"manager\" to Facebook, AND block them!!!  FACEBOOK was provided the PROOF of the STALKING.   BEWARE of Angelina's, they want your MONEY, but don't want to give you the FOOD, or the SERVICE.  They are NASTY, RUDE, CONDESCENDING, and BELLIGERANT.  Notice how there is NO APOLOGY for them STEALING my money, which tells ME, that, that was their intent...to STEAL my money."}
{"text":"Warning there pizzas are addictive. great service, great pizza. love this place. They make the pizza old style with little crust piched beautifully. The sauce and all the toppings fresh and soooo taste. Really it's ADDICTIVE. Bet you can't eat just one slice."}
{"text":"Love it!  Great pizza - but their breakfast pizza is simply \"the best\".  I take it to the office, to business meetings and pick it up early on weekends - and it always impresses.  Not your chain style pizza - freshly made dough and ingredients, and sauce is superb.  Good salads too!  Have had them cater several events at home and office, and never disappoint.  A hidden charm."}
{"text":"LOVE it. crust is perfect. the sauce is so yummy. kind of on the sweeter side, if you dig that.  i think their cheesy breadsticks are fabulous.  this is my go to for carry out pizza. quick, hot, delicious! check angelinas out! i think some of the best pizza around!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and really enjoyed the pizza. Prices aren't that bad compared to most pizza places (minus maybe the big chain ones). Only complaint is some of the pizzas are excessively greasy...only a complaint unless you're looking for a lot of greasiness.   I like it and whenever i'm out in that area Angelina's is my choice of pizza provider."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Perfect crust and great sauce. Good garlic bread too. Not so great wings but hey, they're a pizza place!!"}
{"text":"Angelina's is a good pie. We got a delivery to our hotel (Ramada Elyria) and it was right on time. Good crust and toppings. Sauce was a bit on the sweet side but I can manage that.  Overall a good place to order in Elyria."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gotten this pizza a few times. The crust and sauce are both pretty tasty but it is just way too greasy and cheesy. This past time we both didn't feel well the next day after eating it. They have screwed up our order twice now by forgetting to put on one of our toppings. They did refund our money for one of the pizzas which was a nice gesture since we ended up with just cheese instead of pepperoni which wasn't what we wanted. For gluten sensitivity folks, they do have pretty good gluten free crust. Overall, for the price, I don't think it is worth it. I think we will be looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place around!  Our family does not order pizza often but when we do we only get the best.   Pizza: Top notch! Just tastes fresh. Good crust and sauce recipe. My favorite is the Hawaiian pizza.   Delivery: a little slow but most of the time I order is during the busiest times so I can't knock them for that.   Price: You get what you pay for... they are more expensive than your traditional chain pizza joints, but nothing unreasonable.   Overall... good pizza, right value.  Been to the N. Ridgeville branch as well and the same could be said."}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  The sauce is a little too sweet for me, and I do like sweet sauce.  Added some parm cheese and crushed red peppers and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Definitely the best pizza you can find in this area. We've had issues with their delivery a few times so I suggest sticking to carry out unless you like your pizza cold. They also offer a take and bake option, premade pizza that you bake at home, which is perfect if you like your pizza extra crispy."}
{"text":"We received a welcome package to the neighborhood in the mail. We figured we would give it a try. We ordered a large cheese and a large pepperoni and sausage. The sauce is fantastic, the crust is amazing and the toppings were perfect.  We have been sticking to Marcos but I am glad to have found a local pizza that is FANTASTIC!!!!"}
{"text":"The meatball pizza is my favorite. The cute little meatballs think wedding soup are just divine. I also love their super sweet sauce. I could dunk everything in it."}
{"text":"Just the BEST period!  I don't bother with any other pizza because none compare in my opinion. The sauce is wonderful, the crust is perfect not to thin and not too thick. YUM!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza, my parents used to drive to their other location when I was a kid to pick up dinner. The location wasn't close to us but it was definitely our families favorite and then came an Elyria location too. Don't always have to many deals but I'd say it's the best in the area hands down!!! Probably been eating their pizza for 15 years or more between the two locations. A little pricier then other place but I'd say you get what you pay for. All I know about is their pizza, never tried anything else on their menu. Definitely worth giving it a try if you've never had it."}
{"text":"Angelina's Pizza is the best pizza I've found in NE Ohio. Their take 'n bake pizza is my go-to since I can pick it up and then take it home and bake it off when convenience so it's uber hot and fresh. Online ordering is a breeze. My fav is the deluxe with extra sauce. Substitute the sausage for meatballs and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We stopped over in Elyria, Ohio on our way to Canada, and we were hoping to order something in since the kids were tired.  This place advertised all of these awards that they received locally for their pizza.  Our hopes were high as we were hoping for some  decent pizza and pasta.    When the food arrived I am sad to say...it tasted just as it looked, bad and probably not freshly made.  The onion rings were identical to the frozen ones you get in the store, and the pizza was sadly awful.  The pasta noodles were decent, but the Alfredo sauce that came with them was ridiculous.  The sauce was a watery mess with zero taste.  I cannot imagine it did not come from a can.  So please do not waste your time on this establishment.  For a small town like Elyria it may pass the test, but it fails when you look at actual taste."}
