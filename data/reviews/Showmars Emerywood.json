{"text":"It was good but parking sucks and the chicken looked pink and I asked if it was ok to eat and they said that's just the way the chicken looks. So we will see if I get sick. Also they had problems with their soda machine."}
{"text":"Sorry but I have to agree with Joseph to a certain degree, the manager is rude. I love Showmars but will not be returning to this location. I have never encountered this problem at the other locations in Charlotte which is why I gave 2 stars and not 1."}
{"text":"Great service, manager is always interacting with diners, food beats national chains by a big margin. Lucky to have one close."}
{"text":"It's one star because there is no zero star option!!!
A Greek salad with no feta cheese!!
And a dressing that smells like FISH OIL!! 

What a waste of time and money!
Never again."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Showmars to go to but now I will not go back!
It seems like they have new kitchen staff who have never worked in a restaurant before and have no idea what they are doing nor anyone supervising what is given to the customer. The meat is dry and the sauces are unedible. It's sad because it used to be the best but now I will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"How does Showmars do it?

I was impressed with Showmars the first time I tried their food and this time was no exception.  Showmars is the best food in its class compared to any of its closest competitors.  No other restaurant stacks up to Showmars in terms of food quality and service.

Our food was out reasonably quickly and everything was piping hot.  Each item we ordered was extremely appetizing.

Nothing disappointed.  The popcorn shrimp entrée is made with tender and mild tasting bite-sized shrimp. The crinkle cut fries are hearty and the uniquely shaped hushpuppies were prepared just as they should be.  I would classify the onion rings as quite good but I would not consider them to be a standout item.

My favorite item, the fried flounder was perfectly breaded and prepared and there was so much flounder I wondered how I would manage to eat it all.  I also requested an order of grilled pita bread.  It compliments the fish perfectly.  It has a slightly chewy texture and a fresh off the grill taste.  Their pita bread, just like so many of their entrees is hard to beat considering the price.  Overall value of all items is excellent.

Service was prompt, friendly and attentive.

I am still not certain how Showmars does it but I am certainly glad they do."}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite Showmars, but it does the trick on a busy workday when I need to get in and out with a well priced, non-fast food lunch.  Located just off of South Blvd, parking can be a bit of a squeeze during peak lunch hours, but you'll be able to find a spot behind the restaurant if there isn't one available out front.  

Today's lunch of a chicken salad pita with fries and a sweet tea worked just fine.  One thing I do particularly like about this location is the variety of dessert dishes.  In addition to the standard Showmars baklava, they also have several different types of pie (cream and otherwise) - whee!"}
{"text":"A charlotte staple, onion rings are fantastic but still rank second in my book. I came for the gyro though something seemed different about it but still good none the less. 

Ps. This place is not in Ballentyne.  It's Starmont.

HOLY CRAP I JUST NOTICED THEY HAVE CHEERWINE ON TAP!!!!!!!    
~angels singing~"}
{"text":"Changing my review since my last review. They have good gyros, I lived in a Greek neighborhood for a few years and let me tell you, the Greeks know how to eat.  The service is friendly and they have burgers and fries (yum). They also have some good fish sandwiches.  If you're close to one and you're hungry it's a good place with a big menu for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We just found out they changed ownership, and we're sad. We've been going to this Showmar's for probably 15+ years, usually getting the same items. The last time I ordered one of my usuals - fish pita, sauce on the side. When we got home and looked at the order, they had grilled chicken with lettuce and tomato on a pita. Not at all what I ordered or even sounding like it. When I called to let them know we'd be coming back to get the correct order, the lady on the phone argued with me and said she personally took the order and had it right.  But, she'd be willing to give me credit. Excuse me? The previous owners and staff would NEVER have argued something like that. And they probably would have thrown in a free piece of Baklava on top of it. This new organization needs to get to work on their customer service skills, as well as some of the other complaints noted recently here, or they're going to lose a lot of customers. They might already have."}
{"text":"One Star.  Ordered take-out by phone.  They said order would be ready in 10 minutes.  I came to pick up order, told them I phoned in order,  told them my name,  order was not ready.  Waited at least another 25 minutes. Finally I received my order.  No apology. Nothing.  Will not go to this location again.  Too late for an apology; should have been done on the spot while I was there."}
{"text":"The food was great. I ordered a burger pita. There were 3 patties inside which made a fatso glad. There were fries and a sodie as well. My fiancée ordered the chicken santario and she received it a few minutes later. She was glad to have eaten that. I don't have any late night gas as I lay here so that's a well cooked meal. The guy who took our order suggested I go back. I enjoyed the burger enough to go back again but I might try another item."}
{"text":"Our girl, Courtney has left Showmars...  and we are SAD.  It's like the soul has been removed from the place; very noticeable energy change.  The replacement girls are ok, but not personable like Courtney was.  We continue to miss her smiling face."}
{"text":"Love This Place!
The food is consistently good! The employees are efficient, and seem to enjoy their jobs!  I love the Super C burger, unless I get the Flounder and Shrimp Combo.  No matter what I order I know the hot food will be hot, and the cold food will be cold.  I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"I think the management has changed. My husband and I used to go here for lunch, but things have gone downhill the past two times. The atmosphere is less friendly. 

Today we walked out without even ordering, having waited directly in front of the registers while the manager and one employee ignored us for a long moment. I lost my patience when the employee served the person who had just walked in behind us--immediately after this customer was asked to move her car because she was blocking the back parking lot. It was as if we were invisible. 

Next time we want Greek food, we'll go to the Mad Greek."}
{"text":"I ordered two Greek veggie pitas and sweet potato fries. The food was really good. I got there right at opening. Service was speedy. Customer service was excellent. 

It is important to note that this location does not have soup or black bean burgers. I also was expecting them to serve more Greek food... Like dolmas, falafel, etc.. But they don't."}
{"text":"Food was good,waitresses a pleasure. But unless you are white, don't expect even a hello from the management.
I aproched the counter to trade out the tartar sauce i was given for a cocktail,the manager that helped me stared dagers at me. When I smiled and said thank you for your help,he rolled his eyes!
5 minutes later he was kissing ass on the 1/2 of the restaurant that was predominantly white.
He never spoke to a single black customer.
I love this chain, hate this location"}
