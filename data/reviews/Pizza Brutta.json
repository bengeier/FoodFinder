{"text":"This is your basic great pizzeria.  No table service, but a great atmosphere none-the-less."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Madison, with good nutrition in their food, along with the deliciousness everyone loves. This place also has great service and keeps the place clean."}
{"text":"So we picked Pizza Brutta for our inaugural move-in day Madison pizza.  Yelp played a big part in our choice, of course, and we weren't disappointed.  Wood-fired brick oven Neapolitan style seems all the rage these days, and I've been usually satisfied with the results.  New Glarus on tap gets one star right off the bat.  Add another star for a yummy field greens salad with roasted beets.  And two stars for the thin yeasty chewy crust full of fresh veggie options and that excellent 'Sconnie cheese.  Yep, I think I'm really going to enjoy living in this state."}
{"text":"Quality and local ingredients.  Classic Neapolitan style pizza.  I ordered the Rossoverde (basil, prosciutto, arugula, parmesan, mozzarella).  So good!  Perfectly cooked crust.  First time visit to this place.  Looking forward to trying other items on the menu!  Tip: Free bread and oil, if you check in on yelp."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta gets 5 stars for the food, but 2 stars for the atmosphere/ambience. I was expecting a more intimate experience. Instead, it was a noisy, messy college crowded restaurant, with very little seating. The tables are very close to one another and you might as well join the conversation next to you, cause you can hear every word they're saying.   Lucky for them, the pizza is amazing, so I'll likely go back. In the future, I'll consider take out, or going during off hours.  I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta is a cute little pizzeria on Monroe Street that specializes in gourmet thin-crust pizzas.  You order at the counter and minutes later your pizzas are served hot from the wood-burning oven. The toppings are top-notch, albeit a bit sparse.  I found the crust to be a tad too thin--I like a little more support for my toppings--but you may disagree.  I did not care for the gelato, which was gritty."}
{"text":"Have been twice already this summer and I'm testing out the delivery from Pizza Brutta. If you love mushrooms, the Cremini Pizza is definitely the best pizza you'll ever taste ! Love the stone oven in the restaurant, staff very nice. Delivery on time with delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Pizza Brutta on Monroe St many times and have always enjoyed so when I heard there would be a new one in Middleton, we were very excited.  However, our first visit was a disappointment.  Food - The pizza just didn't seen as good here as on Monroe St.  It was very soggy in the middle and all the topping fell off, don't remember that before.   The amount of mozzarella cheese was skimpy on the Margherita and we also ordered a pizza with the special buffalo cheese and it covered only about 10% of the pizza.  The sausage was very tasty and the tomato sauce was good too.  Price - you know going in to visiting Pizza Brutta that you are paying a premium for the food.  Based on what we ate on this visit we felt like we were overcharged and would have been better off getting a Costco cheese pizza and adding our own fresh toppings like we do from time to time.  Atmosphere - they have done a nice job with the layout of the new restaurant.  The oven is very much front and center for everyone to see and the booth were comfortable.  I have heard from others mixed reviews, perhaps we will give it another try in a few months when we feel like overspending on pizza."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Madison, the taste is incomparable.  The price is a bit much in terms of volume of food per cost, but that isn't much of a negative, as it's a result of the smaller amount of dough involved in their ultra-thin, ultra-delicious Neapolitan style wood-fired pizza. Quality over quantity, and oh, what quality.  I prefer the default margherita pizza, as nothing more is needed beyond tomato, basil and mozzarella, but there are many topping options to choose between, and none of them are anything but the finest quality. The dough is simple and perfect, only the necessary ingredients, so the flavors show through.  The quality does anything but dip as one ventures beyond the pizzas to the realms of fabulous salads (roasted beet with honey balsamic is my pick), and the lunch only \"Pane Brutta\" sandwiches (I absolutely love the caprese, probably more so even than the pizzas).  Do not leave without consuming the butterscotch budino dessert. Don't question it, just let the taste take you away.  The only downside of this institution I've found is the slightly high price point, but it's a faint complaint, and so much else is praiseworthy, there's no good reason to drop below five stars."}
{"text":"Will agree with Mio S. Good quality, fresh, friendly pep.  Actually their salad looked better than pizza."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice now and the pizza is just slightly above average for quality of taste and when we get to go the pizza is basically chilled by the time we arrive even though we're told 15 minutes.....the pizzeria at hilldale is much much better."}
{"text":"We have been to Brutta a half dozen times and the food is consistently great. Finoccio pizza is a favorite, and the large salads are big enough to share w/3-4 people.  Derek (owner?) has been uber-accommodating to my partner, who has a wheat allergy. She brings in her own crusts, and they load it up with any toppings she'd like.  Friendly, kind service + terrific pizza & salads + good wine or beer. Perfect for a relaxed night out with friends or sweethearts. A consistent favorite."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in town!! Place you orders at the counter, and watch your pizza being tossed and baked right in front of you! Everything here is locally-sourced and made from fresh ingredients on the spot. Once they have your toppings sprinkled on the pizzas, they slide them into a traditional brick oven!   I like how the crust is thin, so I could have more slices at one seating and savor the delicious sauce and toppings on them. Their attractive items are the bianco pizzas, made with olive oil base and sea salt. My personal favorites are cremini from the bianco series. The cremini and the mushroom puree blends in so well with the olive oil base i can't help but wish for more each time.  Their fladbreads that come with a tinge of rosemary make for good refreshing appetizers. You can order it with or without asiago cheese.   Pizza Brutta has a nice seating area with around 10 tables or so. Good enough for dine-in, or you can just order ahead for to-go orders. I don't think they deliver, though, otherwise I will find myself having a lot more of their pizzas for sure."}
{"text":"Prior to discovering Pizza Brutta, I ordered a lot of pizzas from Rosatti's and was honestly pretty happy about it. But I can now tell you...I'd been living a lie!  The first time we walked in to Pizza Brutta, I was the guy disappointed about the lack of a pepperoni pizza option (your judgment is painful!), but was quickly cured by the Pizza Diavola. Salami, peppers, fresh mozzarella and just a little bit of basil on a Neapolitan pizza. For me, Pizza Brutta is set apart because of its fresh ingredients, excellent variety and wondeful flavor. And, if you just want to pick it up and take it home - no hour wait here. 10 minutes if they're not busy and 15 if they are.  I will continue to throw money at them as long as they throw pizzas back."}
{"text":"Good classic Italian pizza straight out of a brick oven. There's nothing fancy about this place, just good pizza, good atmosphere, and good staff."}
{"text":"Great pizza at reasonable prices.  Highly recommend it.  Best pizza I've had in Madison.  We had our pizza with a pitcher of beer.  The food was great and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Madison.  The dough is great, and cooked quickly in the brick oven.  My daughter enjoys watching the brick oven cooking process, which you can see from most of the restaurant.  Always has a few pretty good local beers on tap, and tasty homemade pudding for after the pizza."}
{"text":"If you can't decide on a lunch spot come to Pizza Brutta. Don't think about it. Just do it.   When you get here order at the counter. It doesn't really matter what you order because it's all delicious but I suggest a Rossoverde pie and the caprese salad. Wash it down with a Dale's Pale Ale.    Service is always fast and courteous so don't forget to drop a few bucks in the tip jar. After all, you're eating delicious food for a really low price point. Don't be stingy."}
{"text":"Pretty underwhelming compared to what it could be. The focaccia appetizer is way too plain and it will most likely come out with pizza. The service was alright but nobody seemed happy. The cardboard box holding the pizza peel sits on the ground and is not good safe or eye pleasing."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza I've tasted. Thin crust, crispy, fresh ingredients, not greasy - just perfect! The service is fast and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing but the BEET SALAD is even better.  My husband and I went here after a friend recommended it (plus it's right across the street from Trader Joe's, so you can eat there before shopping to avoid doing groceries on an empty stomach--never a good idea!)  We split a Lombardo pizza and a small beet salad.  We left satisfied (although I could've eaten a pizza on my own, it was great!)  We will definitely be back to try one of their white pizzas."}
{"text":"Despite living in Chicago where there are so many food options, my favorite authentic brick-oven pizza place is a small mom&pop operation in Indiana. I first was introduced to the place about 8 years ago. I never thought I would discover a place that could come close to rivaling my Indiana heartthrob but Pizza Brutta unexpectedly has put up an amazing fight for number 1. It's hard to describe exactly why Brutta pizzas are so good; but the freshness of the ingredients and the baking know-how and capabilities definitely are part of the package. The true secret, however, is the sauce. It is i-n-c-r-e-d-i-b-l-e. I happened to stumble upon this place when I was in town last weekend (after reading a few Yelp reviews) and was so blown away, that I returned for lunch two days later before heading back to Chicago.  Madison, you're a lucky city."}
{"text":"Although Pizza Brutta does have some pretty amazing (and authentic) pizza, and tasty salads, I have to give the owner and his team a major thumbs down for what happened today. I placed a $550 order for lunch catering three weeks ago, all to be completely forgotten about. Upon calling to confirm my 11:45 delivery, the owner was completely baffled. I love to support local business and local food, but unfortunately Pizza Brutta is off my list for making me look like a complete idiot (and disappointing a large group of people looking forward to the food I was raving about).   The owner was understandably frazzled, but offered no compensation or reconciliation for his and his team's mistake. The suggestion to go to Subway or Jimmy John's was pretty appalling as well, since the whole premise of Pizza Brutta is to support local business, local food and local culture.  In sum: good pizza, but the team needs to get a better handle on catering. I'll have to enjoy my authentic Italian pizza at Cafe Porta Alba from now on!"}
{"text":"Yummy artisan pizzas! This isn't your typical chain pizza. The crust is tasty, the toppings unique. Definitely try the nutella dessert pizza - super delicious. We have been twice and both times have had great pizza and great service."}
{"text":"The pizza tasted great. The rest of the night, however, was a comedy of errors.  My friends and I went out on a Friday night to Pizza Brutta, and it was the first time there for nearly all of us. We ordered our pizzas, one each, and drinks. While ordering my build-your-own pizza, I asked the man at the counter for topping recommendations, and he had none. I asked if he thought the eggplant would go well on my marinara + arugula pizza, and he said he thought it'd be fine. Fine? Does that mean good? Bad? What should I get instead? Salesmanship is a skill, and he should know the menu and what works well together. I went with the eggplant.  The wine list was small and our wine came in small glasses better suited for root beer than wine (shape matters when it comes to wine). My Cabernet was adequate, my friends' glasses of Montepulciano were underwhelming. Our pizzas arrived, mine without arugula, my boyfriend's with a hair in  it, and my friend's pizza didn't actually arrive at all. She had to go and order it again, nibbling my crusts as she waited for her own food. We told the server about the hair in the pizza and she just shrugged. Que sera, sera is a great attitude, but hair in restaurant meals is unprofessional and unappetizing. My boyfriend was starving and not interested in making a fuss, so he removed the hair and ate around that slice.   My pizza tasted good - the crust was the star with nice flavor and chewiness, and the toppings were as expected (once I had them all). My friends thoroughly enjoyed the pizzas they ordered. However, the series of oddities from ordering to receiving our food makes it unlikely we will return."}
{"text":"I don't believe I've ever eaten better pizza.  Brutta's got absolutely amazing wood-fired crust, unbelievable sauce and the freshest, best toppings you can find.  The atmosphere is pretty good, too. I love the giant brick oven just behind the register, the pictures on the walls, the big windows facing Monroe Street and the cozy space.  I don't recommend going on an empty stomach, however. The pizzas are smallish and thin, and they'll put a dent in your wallet, for sure. But for the best pizza ever? I've gotta give 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and the casual and friendly service and high-quality pizza have been impressive both occasions."}
{"text":"Very authentic and delicious Italian pizza. Fresh and tasty and very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and casual atmosphere make for a great combination.  They even make their own mozzarella!  Great selection of fresh toppings and tasty brick-oven crust.  Would definitely return next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Pizza was OK. It's the poor HYGIENE that earned them 2 stars here! Bare hands for everything, including sticky goat cheese that was dug up using fingernails. After that, it was squeezed & scraped off of those hands...YUCK!!! It got worse once those hands grabbed the door handle to the back kitchen -- then back from the kitchen & wiping them down the sides of pants... You get the idea. The wood-fire oven is for quick browning from the top & bottom -- NOT for sterilizing all the stuff that's on it."}
{"text":"My mouth generally begins to salivate when I walk into the doors of Pizza Brutta; not only due to the tantalizing smells, but also the excitement over the meal I am about to consume.  Expect a crispy-crunchy wood-fired crust and an array of fresh ingredients. This is the real deal Italian-style za so don't mosey in looking for thick crust. A robust serving is given for a reasonable price and the service is always quick and friendly.   My only word of caution is that the toppings and sauce have a tendency to slide off, which makes for a less ideal pizza eating experience. Perhaps a less soggy pizza center would ameliorate this dilemma.  This place delivers in taste, ambience, service and overall deliciousness. I suggest stopping in if you're in the area or making a special trip to try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Really excellent crispy thin crust pizza.  Simple, fresh, and flavorful.  We really enjoyed the Margarita pizza, which arrived within 10 minutes of placing our order.  Loved the chewy, crispy crust and fresh ingredients.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza that I ever had around here. I love the crust and the fact that the pizzas are not extremely oily like most American pizzas. There's a bunch of customization that can be done and the ingredients are always fresh. I really like the fact that each pizza is hand made and you can see the chefs making them right next to the cashier. The only downside is that they don't do delivery and the restaurant itself is small and there's not enough tables sometimes."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever made. Period. They only come in one size though, like a small. But its superb. Sometimes I eat two pies."}
{"text":"This place is good.  Go, you won't be dissapointed.  We love the caprese salad as it is fresh and the mozzarella was fantastic.  I wish they would use just a little less olive oil however.    We have had many of the pizza's on the menu and they are all good and the prices are really reasonable.  I like this place, we will be regulars here and it is in our top 5 places to go.    Yelp tip....get the Wiso pop coupon after you check in.    Another yelp tip:  If you want to leave a tip have cash with you.  The credit card slip doesn't leave room for gratuity."}
{"text":"I've tried pizza from all four corners of this country and then some and I've yet to find a neapolitan style pizza that is better than Pizza Brutta.  I found this shop after reading reviews claiming how wonderful each pie could be.  I was in Madison for a week attending school at the Fluno Center and figured it was worth the walk to give this place a try.  All I can say is I'm so glad I came to Madison!    This restaurant is typical of what I have found here during my stay which is friendly people, great product, and a commitment to what they do.  Well I'm back here in Madison for more training this week and the first and last place I will hit will most definitely be Pizza Brutta.  This is truly one of those places where the food has always been as good as what I dreamed about. :)"}
{"text":"Loved it.  Perfect thin and charred crust and great toppings.  Very fast service for a busy place.  Better than the place at Hilldale."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Madison by far.  Light and flavorful, worth every penny.  The portions are very good for an individual to savor with stuffing yourself silly.  Ingredients are high quality and fresh.  They have a check in deal that I was able to take advantage of to try their signature margarita pizza.  Simply the best!"}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta is definitely the best pizza in Madison. If you like thin crust/wood fired pizza, this is your place. Food comes out really quickly! Plenty of vegetarian pizza options- and the salads are good as well!  Only reason lacking 5 stars is because the interior isn't anything to be impressed about.  If you can, get a seat at the bar at the window - good people watching on Monroe on a busy weekend!"}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere. Amazing pizza for a very reasonable price. Wonderful menu. I've had wood-fired pizza like this from different places & Pizza Brutta is definitely at the top of the list. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The pizza at Pizza Brutta easily lands five stars. Done in the Neapolitan style, Brutta's pizzas are some of the best in the city. Thin, stretchy dough is topped lightly with sauce and mozzarella cheese (some have feta or asiago), along with an excellent choice of toppings, like fresh arugula, prosciutto, cremini mushrooms, or prosciutto, to name a few. The pizza is then placed in a blazing-hot wood fired oven, where it is cooked to bubbly, crispy goodness in under a couple minutes. Order one of the pre-designed pizzas from the menu (which are sublime) or pick and choose your own ingredients to top your pie. The Margherita pizza has been perfected at Brutta, and it is a timeless but satisfying pizza perfect for looking for something straightfoward (it consists of red sauce, mozzarella, and basil). The Salami e Funghi is a perfect combination of crumbled Italian sausage and cremini mushrooms, the tang of the sauce cutting through the fat of the sausage. Other notables include the Margherita con Bufalo (margherita pizza made with buffalo milk mozz) and the Diavolo (pepperoncini and salami).   Moving down the menu, the salads and flatbread are good but not noteworthy. Brutta does the pizza best, and the pizza is what you come here for, anyway. Drinks consist of beer and wine, along with San Pellegrino sodas and Mexican Coke and Sprite (with real sugar, yum!).  The atmosphere is usually busy and bright, as the spot is very popular with Madisonians. Food is ordered at the front counter after standing in line. Hard wooden booths give the place an Italian cafe feel, but are not as easy on the back as they are on the eyes. The restaurant can be  noisy, but not overly loud.  The service and atmosphere are mostly why Pizza Brutta misses the mark of a 5-star review. The servers are all high school or college students. You order from the counter and sit anywhere, rather than having a waiter help guide you through the experience. Full waiter service could be incredibly useful for Pizza Brutta, given the different types of pizzas that are quite different from your average American slice. Servers have a tendency to clunk down plates of pizza, serving more as deliverymen than waiters.  That being said, Pizza Brutta is a must if you're looking for great pizza. They also offer takeout, and it's a great place for families."}
{"text":"A gem for fresh za in madison! Not the cheapest price for quantity but the quality of the za makes up for it. Beer selection is a little weak...but hey it's a small pizza joint and the za is the feature item! True pizza lovers will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta is delicious and affordable for Italian-style pizza. They have good selection of both red-sauce and white individual pizzas for about $10-11. It is plenty of food to take home a couple of slices for leftovers. They cut the pizza into slices for you, which takes away some of the authentic charm of the pizza, but it makes it easier to eat of course! They also have quite a few salads, but I have not tried them. Overall, it is a great place for good food in a casual setting."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison period. Simple, straightforward place with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I used to think the only good place to get this kind of pizza was Cafe Porta Alba, but Pizza Brutta is just as good, faster, and cheaper.  Their pizza is amazing and their sandwiches are just as good.   I've tried their sandwiches but I constantly find myself going back for a Margherita pizza with pepperoni.  Absolutely delicious every time I've gone and I've gone a lot!  Things to note:  The pizzas are approximately big enough for 1 person unless you're going to split a salad.  Their sandwiches are also delicious but it's very hard to order one when you could be getting one of their pizzas.  They bring them out to you as soon as they're done and they're piping hot.  I just can't say enough about how good they are!"}
{"text":"The Caprese Salad is divine! Super yummy fresh mozzarella which I adore. This is only my first time here and I think I should come here more often. All my friends love here."}
{"text":"Great! Was very organic and had a great body. I was worried that the 10 inch with a side salad was small for two people, but it filled us up. Recommend for those who love authentic Italian pizza not for those who crave toppings and extra cheese."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away on Monroe St. but lively inside on a Friday night. Great atmosphere and easy walk-up counter. Had the margherita and nostrano and both were delicious. Crispy crust but chewy. Beer and wine, too, and everything reasonable priced. Definitely will go again and try a few of the salads, which looked really fresh."}
{"text":"This is a fu-fu pizza place where every possible combination of pizza has a stupid forgettable Italian word name.  If you like that kind of thing, you will think this place is the best of everything there is in the world.  I like NY style pizza.  I got the oregano pizza and added pepperoni for a $1.50 more.  I don't remember the fu-fu name of the pizza, but it was one of the ones in the make your own section of the menu.  The good:  The mozzarella has the best flavor of cheese that I have ever had.  The sauce, even though it is just crushed tomato, had a very good flavor.  The crust, although thinner than I like, was excellent.  Quality of ingredients is top notch.  The overall flavor of the pizza is good.  I would give the pizza 4 stars.  The bad:  $1.50 for ~13 really small flavorless pepperoni.  Spots on the pizza had no sauce and/or no cheese - as far as I am concerned this is inexcusable.  What's worse is that I think they did it deliberately to be more \"authentic\" or trendy.  $1.50 extra for basil or oregano if it doesn't come on your named varietal of pizza.  This isn't leaves, this is small amounts of shredded herb.  In my opinion, a pizza sauce should come with the seasoning already figured out and included.  But again, the sauce is clearly listed as crushed tomato and did taste good.  This is why I don't eat at those pick your own ingredient Asian places where they cook it right in front of you.  Part of what I am expecting from a restaurant is to do the research work for me.  I have no idea of what would taste good together.  Why do I have to have a culinary degree in order to eat something that tastes good at your restaurant?  Of course, I could be wrong on this as their pizza was good for what it was.  The ugly:  This place is the kind of fu-fu that makes you think the owners have their heads so far up their own orifices trying to stick to a very specific idea, that doing something that is better would never enter their minds.  Lipstick on water glass.  Recommendations:  Provide disposable water cups.  Make a pizza named \"New York\" that mimics the best pizza in the world."}
{"text":"Oh man! The best just got better! Gift cards, boys and girls! Perfect for dads, grads, and birthdays. Nothin' sez love like a fire roasted fresh everywhere flatbread pizza creation!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The only negative I can think of is that they only serve their sandwiches during lunch. They have this one sandwich with pesto, mozzarella, prosciutto and arugula - it is to die for. I haven't had it in months and I still think about it every time I forget to bring my lunch to work and I am sitting at my desk trying to think of what I want to eat. Yeah, it's pretty memorable. Their pizza is also fantastic. Just be prepared to eat an entire pizza yourself. Don't try to share one, it's not big enough for two people, and you won't want to share it. This is by far my favorite pizza place in Madison. Just be aware, this is a wood-fired, thin crust, minimalist style pizza focused on the ingredients. Those who are fans of stuffed pizzas filled with 12 toppings may not like it so much."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. Pizza tasted as fresh as fresh can get and the flavor popped. I'd go back. I had the Nostrano and my girlfriend had the Lombardo. I liked hers a little more than mine."}
{"text":"Highly enjoyable! We were there on a Saturday night and afraid it would be hard to be fed in a reasonable amount of time, but if people follow the rules and order before sitting, it all works out. We got very lucky finding a parking spot nearby.  Ordered 2 pizzas and a salad for myself and my 3 teenage sons which fed us adequately."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza.   When done right, all food can be a near spiritual experience. Brutta does that for wood-fired oven thin crust pizza. It is delicious. Great local, handmade, organic ingredients, fresh, simple, perfect.  Yum.  Cons:  A bit expensive, and it will not fill you up like a cheap delivery gut bomb (think any national chain),"}
{"text":"Fantastic tuna sandwich! In awesomly crispy ciabatta bread and a thick layer of fresh arugula. Great lunch option."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta is the perfect local pizzeria. If you're a fan of neapolitan pizza and can handle burnt crust bubbles, definitely check it out.   They serve up tasty pizzas with fresh ingredients in a casual atmosphere. They don't allow reservations, but tables turn quickly. The staff is friendly and always willing to grab me some Parmesan. I highly recommend the Greco with olives, artichokes and feta."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great atmosphere . Gorgonzola and caprese salads are terrific. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Had the a fennel sausage and smoked mozzerella pizza. There was very little flavor to the sausage and to the whole pizza overall until I doused it with parmesan cheese. Also there was little to know smoky flavor the cheese. A definite disapointment but still alright pizza. Thus my rating is dropped to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good solid pizza.  Fresh ingredients.  Great wine and beer selections. Great dessert option."}
{"text":"This is truly the best pizza you will find in the entire state of Wisconsin. It hits the spot every time I go, which is a good amount. The neapolitan style pizza is made in the front of the restaurant where you could even watch if you'd like, by the pizza makers. All of the ingredients are organic, they use fresh produce and ship in special sauces and flour from italy. They have a wide array of pizzas on the menu so everyone could find one they love.  The restaurant owner founded it after traveling to Italy and learning about the pizza trade first hand from chefs there. He is really nice, I've seen him there working many times and he is very friendly and sweet. I have even seen him on the bike path with his family!   Also, they have some really delish drinks that I love (mexican coke and san peligrino's!!) that other restauraunts don't which is super nice.  It's a great place to go for a quick, cheap, lunch. A pizza is always about 9 bucks and will fill one person up heartily. There are no servers you pay then sit with a number and it is brought out, you can refill your fountain drinks, so I think that is really nice too!   Good job Pizza Brutta!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Olivetto and was pleased. If you're looking for greasy, cheese laden pizza, this isn't the place. It's fresh and the crust is plentiful. I think they could have been more generous with toppings considering the price. this pizza won't drag you down and fill you with grease, and I finished the single serving pizza fairly fast all by myself, left feeling full. If you want fresh, healthy, wood fired pizza, this is the place. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, helped us through ordering our first time. I would give four stars but I think it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Oh.... man.  Best pizza EVER. It was so delicious.  If it weren't so pricey (worth every damn penny) I'd probably eat there way more often. Slightly out of my price range but definitely a place for special occasions/when you feel like being fancy."}
{"text":"Greatest thin-crust pizza I've ever had!! I'm normally a deep-dish person, but that honestly weighs your stomach down sometimes -- it's just so refreshing to eat thin crust, and it's a different experience for me because after every slice of pizza from here I always want MORE.   My go-to pizza is the Salumetto, as I have quite an affinity to all things meat, and Pizza Brutta incorporates this perfectly without being overwhelming at all. On a vegetable occasion, I'd recommend anything they have with arugula -- let it wilt down a bit, and the spicy, soft greens perfectly complement the crisp, thin crust. If you're a light eater, half a pizza is usually enough, but as a light eater myself, I have days where I need an entire pizza to myself.  Their sandwiches are also top-notch as well. My favorite is the PLT (pancetta arugula tomato) and I must inform you that this is no ordinary sandwich. First of all, it's made inside pizza dough (+1) and it had a smoked tomato aioli (+2). Not your typical ketchup and mustard type of sandwich.  It's in a great place southwest of Randall stadium, but if you can't make it there on a lunch break, I highly recommend taking the time to venture here."}
{"text":"The first time I went to pizza brutta I was totally impressed. The pizza reminded me of pizza I had eaten in Italy. I like that they use really fresh ingredients and you can watch them make the pizzas. The last time I was there we put our order in and didn't receive the pizza with the toppings we had asked for. They did make us a new one right away, but that was a little disappointing because by the time they brought the correct pizza the rest of us were almost finished with ours."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison by far. Thin crust perfect light toppings that are meant to provide flavor (rather than a side dish atop the dough!). I love this place and go once a week or so without tiring of it. They also have a lunch combo that is the deal of the century. Service slacks off when the owner, Derek, isn't there. The past few times i was there my order was messed up-- three in a party of four are served and the fourth person's pizza comes out 20 minutes later, or salads are forgotten. They just have a really inefficient system for conveying orders from the register to the kitchen. But happily, they are so nice that every time they screw up an order, they give me a coupon for a free pizza. It must cost them a fortune and I wish they would simply improve their operation. But it doesn't stop me from returning because the staff are always friendly and the food NEVER disappoints. Great place to bring kids."}
{"text":"First time tonight.  Excellent pizza from the brick oven, arguably the best in town.  Did not take long to receive the two pizzas.  Upon leaving the owner/manager thanked us for coming.  That's local service!"}
{"text":"I am an artisan pizza lover but this place really skimps on cheese.  I appreciate that they use organic ingredients and pizza comes out fast.  Pizzas are individually sized."}
{"text":"Found this gem while visiting from out of town. We were the first customers of the day so they gave us an extra pizza for free. Awesome service and by far some of the best pizza I've ever had. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"One of our FAVORITE places in Madison!  The best pizza in Madison, hands down. The crust, sauce and fresh toppings are all perfect, and the salads were fresh and delicious as well. (sylvetta salad was our favorite} The location always made it a great outing,located across from Trader Joe's and near Art Gecko. This will be a spot we will not miss next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"On point service, and this is the only place where you can eat a full personal pizza and not feel fat. They have the classics (margherita, marinara, etc.), but also put their own Italian spin on some of the other pizzas (Lombardo, which features gorgonzola, ham, basil and garlic, and the Finocchio, which has oregano, pepper flakes, and fennel sausage are to name just a few of the pizza options). All of the pizzas have the same crust, which is crunchy while at the same time doughy, crisped to peak awesomeness in a classic brick oven. They have a nice salad option, which throws some of the pizza options into a bowl of leaves. And they offer a flatbread pizza! Okay, granted, it's not technically a pizza, just focaccia with oregano and olive oil, but it's still to die for. And for dessert? Creamy gelato or Nutella pizza, which was definitely an Ancient Rome delicacy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pizza in Madison. Along with great salads (perfectly - not overly - dressed), a solid beer and wine list, and a warm, relaxed vibe."}
{"text":"They have gluten free pizza! Was so happy to find they have gluten free - and it's delicious. We also ordered the caprese salad and it was so good. Very kid friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Awesome wood-fired pizza with a very casual vibe. I've had a few pizzas here, but I like sticking to the classics...oh, and the fennel sausage.   Their great personable service helped me pick out my pizza and pack up when I was done.  Only downside: buy the water, don't get the tap. It's not filtered, and tastes weird."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere.  Quality ingredients, Excellent wood-fired pizzas, salads, and sandwiches.  Been here many times, always been a good experience."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta is indeed a cute and very well designed artisanal pizzeria.  I use artisanal because they produce truly authentic and well made pizzas and don't go the route that so many others go with offering just weird pizzas with strange toppings and crusts. The pizza here always has the perfect amount of sauce, has a delicious thin crust, fresh toppings and hand stretched mozzarella.  And as perfect as the pizza is here it's the sandwiches that I love the most, they are some of the best in Madison.  Try the Caprese, Cosi has nothing on this places house made ciabatta bread."}
{"text":"The pizza is quite lovely and I thoroughly enjoyed my margherita with mushrooms. The fresh basil, the sauce, the mozzarella-- all above average. But what I was most impressed with was the level of service we enjoyed here on Tuesday night. This is an order-at-the-counter local spot and they only serve what they do best- pizza and salads. They also offer a smattering of beers and wines by the glass. The only white I saw on the menu was a pinot grigio, which I ordered. The owner, who took our order, looked high and low but could not find a bottle of it anywhere. Naturally, I was disappointed because- well, I was craving a glass of cold, white wine. Back at the table, our salad came and I contented myself with water, when suddenly, one of the boys from the counter walks over, smiling, with a glass of white wine and said, \"We seem to have found some white wine. It's on the house.\" Other people in my party reported having seen this same guy walking in moments earlier, clutching a bag with what appeared to be a wine bottle protruding from it. Honestly, in this day and age, it is so rare to find a place that cares this much about customer service. We have family in the area and I can confidently say that we will be back-- for the food, yes, but also for the people who treated us like family. You can bet that we tipped big for that little favor! =)"}
{"text":"Holy shit this is good stuff.  It's not \"normal\" pizza - each pizza is very small, has a thin crust, and you'll need to get a separate pizza for each person.  It's not a gorge-yourself-on-cheese-and-greasy-meat kind of meal.  It's pizza to be tasted, savored, and thoroughly enjoyed.  It's pizza for pretentious people, and that's okay.  In fact, it's better than okay, it's the best pizza in town."}
{"text":"I thought my freeza days when I graduated. Wrong!  Pizza Brutta has the best check-in deal in town.  Buy one pizza of any kind and you get a free bianca, formaggi or margherita pizza.   True Neapolitan pizzas are made to perfection in a wood-fired oven.  The ingredients are (mostly) local, applied appropriately, and result in a pizza that actually tastes like something.    On my most recent visit, I had the salami e funghi (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, Genoa salami, kalamata olives and mushrooms) and the formaggi (crushed tomato, oregano, fresh mozzarella).  The crust, as usual, was spot on and the flavors were well-balanced.  An added bonus: the mozzarella is house-made.   I can't wait to go back and try even more of the menu."}
{"text":"Fabulous pizza and great staff!  Wonderful combinations of sweet and savory if that is your thing.  Kid friendly without be overly kiddie."}
{"text":"When we are in the Monroe Street area, we always stop here. Fresh ingredients fired in minutes. Family Friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta is really quite good.  We were initially pretty surprised at how few people were there on a friday night, but they seemed to be doing a brisk takeout business, so I decided to not ruin my meal by worrying about whether this tasty tasty pizza place was going to have to close its doors.  Atmospherically, Pizza Brutta fell a tiny bit short for me. I liked the layout and casual service style (open kitchen, order at the counter from an extremely friendly person), but I thought the dining area should have been classed up just a bit to match the style and quality of the food. The giant coke machine in the middle of the dining room was especially off-putting.  Food was good, though. The salad was simple, composed of high-quality ingredients, and well-dressed. Every leaf of arugula was fresh and the goat cheese was well-chosen. i could have lived without the \"flat bread\" served with it, but it didn't really HURT the dish. We had 2 pizzas (one bianca, one rosso), which were very good. My only criticisms are that they should have been more generous with the green olives (hint: if you're putting a topping on a pizza, there should be enough that every slice will include some), and that the crust could have been a bit more chewy and flavorful. That said, I've eaten at a lot of very serious pizza places in other cities and this crust was not a disappointment, especially given the limitation of using organic flour, it just wasn't the BEST I've ever had.   All in all, we had delicious 2 pizzas and an entree size salad, which was plenty of food for 2 people, plus 2 beers for just about $40 with no hassle on a friday night. We'll be coming back, probably a lot."}
{"text":"I don't need to endlessly pontificate on this one; some of the best Neapolitan pizza in the Midwest.  Brutta is easily up there with Spacca Napoli in Chicago, Punch in Minneapolis and Il Ritrovo in Sheboygan.  Their commitment to local ingredients, ie. Iowa Prosciutto, Midwest flour and vegetables from the Dane county area, make them truly unique amidst similar restaurants.  The space itself is casual and efficient.  The prices are great.  My one complaint is their beer/wine set-up.  Each time you want a refill you gotta get back in the line (often reaching to the back door) just to get a refill.  Now, I've worked in the industry long enough to know that you can make some good dough (pun intended) on alcohol.  Why make it so difficult to get a refill?  Perhaps they could put a busser on filling drink orders?  Or maybe allow drink orders to be filled at the pizza takeout counter?  Either way, they really ought to rectify that...nonetheless, I won't let it taint my 5-stars."}
{"text":"If you're near Monroe Street, this is definitely one of my favorite places to eat. Service is generally pretty fast, as the format is that you order at the counter and the staff brings out the pizza to you.  The check-in feature is pretty neat for the free flatbread.  Probably wouldn't pay for the flatbread, but it was a nice appetizer that just doesn't compare to how good the pizzas are.  The cremini pizza is my go-to; the combination of mushrooms is super savory, and the white sauce isn't overpowering. Mushrooms and caramelized onions are my weakness, put them together with cheese, and then ooh boy what a wonderful combination. I get this almost every time that I come; it's too good to stay away if you're a mushroom fiend.  I tried the diavola too, which was such a contrast from the cremini. The spiciness of the pepperoni with fresh mozzarella was a lighter taste, but both were absolutely delicious!  My only qualm is that multiple times that I've visited is that, sometimes, because the dough is hand rolled out, the middle can sometimes be super thin and get a little soggy, that that by no means keeps me from coming back.  One pizza is more than enough for one person, but I would definitely recommend bringing a friend and splitting two because there are so many wonderful combinations to try!"}
{"text":"Best brick oven pizza ever & we know pizza!!! The staff is extremely helpful and the ingredients they use are super fresh. A menu that offers the off the wall choices made with a brick oven touch!! Don't leave without having the Nutella pizza--absolutely to DIE for!!!!"}
{"text":"It's not the best pizza I have had but it was good . One thing I might suggest is making the pizza bigger buying a pizza to share might not be enough for 2 people and at that point it becomes very expensive..but over all the food and service was great"}
{"text":"A local favorite. Wood fire pizza made to order!  Many of the ingredients are local, it's acceptable to swap/make substitutions with ingredients, and service is friendly and fast. It's very casual and you'll see students, families, couples."}
{"text":"Everything was on point. We had the beet salad and the gorgonzola salad to start - both were delicious and perfectly dressed. We followed that with a Quattro formaggio and an arrosta pizza. They were so delicious. The staff was friendly, attentive, and service was quick. The next time we're in Madison we'll be sure to eat here again!"}
{"text":"My friend from out of town wanted to go here and said it was great. She was right! Really quality ingredients and interesting pizzas. My husband and I split a special that had Brussel sprouts on it (my fave) and then a classic Margarita as well. They were both delicious. My kids enjoyed the gelato as well and I had a bite...wonderful. The crust is wonderful and I love that the pizzas are made in a wood-fired oven. I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Drove 3 hours for a wedding and decided to go for pizza! Discovered that they close at 9:00pm. There website clearly states 10:00 pm Friday even there yelp page says 10:00pm... We called at 8:40 to verify the time. Place didn't even pick up the phone... We were so excited to try it and mark it in our Where to Eat Pizza Book, but I guess they can't figure out how to change there website or pick up a phone...."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. We stop here on the way back and forth to my bf's family's farm in Wisconsin as a halfway point - and more importantly for an amazing meal and possibly the best Neapolitan pizza I've ever had outside of Italy.   Our standard order is the sylvetta (arugula) salad, a Diavolo and a Bianca. We love sharing one red, spicy pie and then the white, garlicky deliciousness that is the Bianca. SO.GOOD. The crust is perfection. Thin, just enough char but never watery or sloppy - and yet still so thin. All the ingredients you can tell are incredibly fresh. Throw in a New Glarus or $5 montepulciano and it's seriously a perfect meal - and all for about $25 (minus drinks). Plus we always have leftovers that are great the next day when cooked in the oven at 500 for a few minutes.   This place is truly a gem and not just for Madison. It's our favorite over any Neapolitan style pizza in Chicago. Try it!"}
{"text":"Best wood fire za in Madison! My cousin even slipped in her vegan ways to enjoy a cheesy slice at Pizza Brutta. Now I'm not saying you have to compromise your food values for this place, but it's a quant Madison classic and to not try it is a travesty.   My only qualm is that it's so freaky fresh that you almost need a fork if you don't want the thin middle to fall apart. From ordering at the counter to your belly, you're looking at about a 10-15 minute wait. Can be a dressed up or dressed down kind of eatery for sure. I would bring a date or my *vegan cousin here any time!"}
{"text":"High expectations? Yes. Pizza Brutta's savvy branding promises the kind of artisan pizza I've had in New York and DC... but we left a bit disappointed.   Sadly, the pizza was ho-hum -- mine decidedly soggy. And for $24 in Madison (sorry, folks, it's not New York), we expected some very good, crispy pies.  The atmosphere is fine -- nothing special, but clean and tidy. The staff missed a few opportunities to be friendly. Seriously, Pizza Brutta, we might have overlooked your soggy pizza if your staff hadn't been so glum.   All in all, not bad, but we expect better next time!"}
{"text":"Went here while visiting from out of town. My husband and I shared a pizza and a small salad. Yum! I can't remember exactly what we ordered but the salad had a blue cheese on it and was delicious. The pizza we got had a variety of cheeses. The pizza is super thin, but with the salad and one beer I was pretty full. My husband could have probably had more ;) I really like that they use mostly organic ingredients. I also really enjoyed the red sauce. It was probably the tastiest and freshest red sauce I've ever had. This place is definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta is my favorite pizza in Madison by far.  My girlfriend and I get the Lombardo with an order of the caprese, which comes with their flatbread.  They change up their beer selection so I am always able to try something new when I go in. I haven't found a pizza better than this in Madison. I recently moved to Sun Prairie, and I drive right by Salvatore's to get here, it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the Middleton location today for lunch. The USA Today review of Pizza Brutta is incorrect . Not only is it the best pizza in Wisconsin , it's the best pizza in the Midwest ! #lovepizzabrutta"}
{"text":"After travelling to Italy, I can legitimately say that this is as close as it gets in America! Pizza Brutta uses all fresh real ingredients (as much local as they can) nd cooks the food right infront of you in their brick oven, what more van you ask for?!  I have ordered multiple pizzas here but my favorite will always be the Margarita con buffalo pizza. Its a basic margarita pizza (mozzarella, tomatoe sauce, basil) but it has buffalo cheese too and oh my gods its fabulous!   I admittedly stick to pizza everytime I go but i hope to eventually branch out to their fantastic looking salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"LOVE the wood-fired, thin-crust, crispy pizzas! There are two different styles of pies: with tomato-based sauce (rosso), or with olive oil and sea salt (bianco pies). My friend and I tried the prosciutto arugula bianco pie and the nostrano (sausage, red pepper) rosso pie. Both were really flavorful, but we were surprised by how much we both enjoyed the bianco pie; the flavors were rich, yet light, and elegant.   Great (and super reasonably priced! Around $5.50/glass) wine list, and they serve the wine in these super-cute, unassuming little cups.   Only negative is that it's not a super cozy/cute atmosphere. Order up at the counter, and the tables are benches. Not much of a negative though considering the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: traditional pizza, straight from Napoli.  Pizza Brutta is one of those little restaurants that you always love going to. It's in a classic old building on Monroe across from Trader Joe's. The inside features lots of wood and is well-lit from the front windows. There's plenty of seating in the long entry-way, with some more tucked in a back corner.   When you walk in you'll file down the right side all the way to the counter. Here you can watch as they make each order fresh in front of you, with plenty of delicious ingredients, and then pop it straight into the wood-burning brick oven. I've been to Napoli, Italy; this is how it's done, people. You're not getting much more authentic anywhere in this hemisphere.  This time I got the Rossoverde ($12), which is one of their most popular. It features fresh tomato sauce, basil, prosciutto, parmesan, mozzarella, and loads of arugula. Their pizzas don't appear very large when you get them, but for personal pizzas they're more than filling.   The arugula was fresh, and you could taste it in each bite. The sauce is barely there, but featured just enough to hold everything together. I'll always want more prociutto, but there were respectable amounts of that and cheese.  My only minor complaint, and it's more of a note, is that the pizzas are so thin that they become droopy with all the toppings. It's a balancing act that they don't always get perfect, between not burning the crust but making sure the middle is fully cooked. That being said, don't be afraid to messy-up your hands and dig in. I'm drooling just typing this."}
{"text":"Have to agree with the last reviewer. Being from New Haven I have ridiculously high pizza expectations (ask my husband, I can be a real pizza beotch) Wood fire, brick oven, super fresh ingredients = awesome pizza. Pizza gets 5 YUM stars, Ambience gets 3.   1-Sometimes it's really chilly there. I can imagine the pizza chefs are dying next to that oven.   2-It maybe a kid friendly place but you get the occasional screaming kid tearing down the aisle with the parents ignoring them. I'm not anti-kid, I'm anti-rude parents. Grrr!  3- The chefs have a horrible predilection for playing loud Grateful Dead music. Barf.   Try the Rossoverde or the Diavola. So very, very tasty."}
{"text":"Great pizza, service and atmosphere. My 3 year old loved his pizza, which is actually a big deal. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went to the new Middleton store today and it was really good.  How's that for a review?"}
{"text":"Ate here after getting recommendations from friends and they were absolutely accurate.  Great pizza Margarita and the flat bread.  Service was great pizza was very tasty and the price was great,  I will certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"Vying to be our favorite pizza place in Madison... Lots of great options and very good gluten free crust (they cannot vouch for no cross-contamination but we've had no problems). We also love the salads. Good for both eat in and take out. Worth the wait, if any."}
{"text":"Er. how could I have not written a review about my favorite pizza place in town. and in the US!   Classic, italian thin crust pizza. With the freshest ingredients, sourced locally whenever possible, made in a italian standard brick oven. So delicious! I can't say more. You just have to TRY IT.  You enter through the door, there's a small corridor that leads you to the cashier. If you can't get close enough to the hand written menu above the cashier, there are printed menus found along the side of the corridor! There are several categories of items you can order - salad, sandwiches (lunch), pizza and drinks.   There are two types of pizza, bianco (olive oil based) or rosso (tomato based). My favorites are cremini (olive oil based with mushroom), salsiccia (sausage with mushroom, olive based), proscuitto arugula (olive oil based), magherita con bufala (tomato based with buffala mozzarella; I like adding anchovies on it too! And the smoky taste of mozz is awesome).   My new favorite is the special salad caprese - made with fresh moz, tomatoes and pesto. comes with olive oil and bread!   To end the meal, you have to get the caramelo budino. Best one in town. smooth, with tasty cream on top and smooth caramel on the bottom. Not too sweet, like how italian desserts are. Love this place!!!  Just a note, most weekends they are really busy, so prepare to wait. Or, you can order ahead and get take out to eat in the comforts of home!"}
{"text":"Came several times with my friends. Very good quality and authentic Italian pizzas! Reasonable price and a good variety of pizzas; they are all organic! Will recommend it to other friends ;)"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice on overnight stops passing through Madison. We're huge fans of Neapolitan style pizza. This place does not disappoint. We'll be back next time we pass through town."}
{"text":"Don't understand the hype at all. Crust was stale, pizza undersauced and cheesed. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I've probably been 20-30 times  even though I moved away from Madison shortly after it opened. Every time I am back in town I go back.  Easily the best pizza in town. In fact one of best pizzas ever in my book - and I have had a few. Fresh ingredient and very tasty thin crusts. They  bake it in a stone oven and you can watch if you want. Pretty fast and good selection. Always Grisham service.   Easily one of the best food places in Madison - and during my 8.5 years in town I went to tons of restaurants."}
{"text":"Really really delicious brick oven pizza. I had the margherita pizza with pepperonis and it was so tasty and fresh. And you can't go wrong with brick oven pizza! Totally recommend this place and its deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Great brick oven pizza and pretty affordable for what you get. Friendly staff. Definitely worth a stop if you're in Madison. My wife built her own pizza, with mozzarella and crumbled sausage. I had a creation off the menu, which consisted of fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about five times over a four year period. The only reason I do not eat here more often is that I live in the Atwood neighborhood. Enough said. I think Pizza Brutta should open on Atwood. I could set a goal of trying all their ingredients in different combinations. I know each pizza would be delectable. Ingredients are very fresh and the crust thin and crispy. Love the simplicity. The price is right.  I can't believe I ate the whole thing. I hate reheated pizza and I couldn't turn my back on such deliciousness.  Maybe it is just as well it isn't close by. I would weigh a ton."}
{"text":"Yum! It took me a good 10 years living in Madison before finally making it to Pizza Brutta and I've been missing out.   Highly recommend the Rossoverde pizza. If you're able to get there for lunch, their pane brutta focaccia baked sandwiches are amazing."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but they allow smoking in the outdoor seating area. Will not be back until it becomes non smoking."}
{"text":"Lazy hazy day reading bread porn (Chad Robertson's \"Tartine Bread\") interrupted by my boyfriend getting hungry. We went to Pizza Brutta and I had a great opportunity to indulge in the real life versions of the *crusty* *fire-baked* *sweet* *tender* *airy* crust that I had spent all morning reading about and mentally cursing the San Franciscans who can so easily go to Tartine.   But not to worry because Pizza Brutta is there to give you Madisonites the closest we can get.  It's sooooo good! And so local! And so brick-oven-y!  And their homemade mozzarella is soooo much better than mine!  My favorite order: Pizza Diavola. But I would like to give a whoop-whoop for their lunchtime sandwiches as well.  They also have an ample supply of the Isthmus so you can get your crossword on while you pizza."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the wood-fired Marinara pizza yesterday. I added cherry tomatoes and red onions, but probably should have added mushrooms and red peppers for a bit more substance.  It may have been the only vegan option other than building your own, but most vegan pizza options at other pizza restaurants aren't what I enjoy/expect in a pizza."}
{"text":"We eat here in Middleton about once a month and love it! Usually have what they call a small beet salad though it's pretty good size. Then we split a pizza. Absolutely delicious! I really like the wood fire taste and texture."}
{"text":"I would really like to give PB more stars. The place is nice. They have decent wine and beer, although not a large selection. The crust is awesome as many have noted. My issue is that they have great toppings, at high prices, yet put so very little on.  If one orders more than one topping the small amounts, when the pizza price has skyrocketed, are very disappointing.  Better to go to Naples 15 or Porta Alba if you love Neapolitan style."}
{"text":"The pizza is sooooo good! The food is very authentic, but a little expensive. Pretty fast service, and it is a great little gem! Good luck finding parking, but it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison hands down. Cooked to perfection and super high quality ingredients. It can get busy but their quality and quick service never disappoints. A must if you're on Monroe Street."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Took about 5 minutes to cook and it was extremely light and tasty. All the ingredients were great and the size was definitely enough for a hungry 20-something."}
{"text":"FAMILY FAVORITE !!  yes we love it,  and while  the prices are creeping up  it is still a family fav!      Make sure you park underground across the street- under Trader Jos for free.  Otherwise parking can be tricky in the busy neighborhood.    Outdoor seating would be a great addition."}
{"text":"Yeea pretty good. Some of their pizzas can be overkill wth the amount of toppings on them, but this is overall a great and affordable gourmet pizza place where you can have a pie to yourself and some beer to go with it"}
{"text":"Great Neapolitan pizza. Casual atmosphere and friendly staff. Small wine selection, but fits the bill! Love stopping by when we are in town."}
{"text":"This was unexpectedly amazing. There were kids everywhere, kind of smelled like burning, but the pizza was amazing. I got the make your own with Gorgonzola and peperochini (sp?) AMAZING! Others had the harvest tomato, and the motz, which were also great!   A little loud overall, but the food makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"If you are part of the small children contingent, you have found your place. This is not necessarily a bad thing. When I've been in the area, I've seen many families with small children file into this place. I would say they have everything for young families, except the massive stroller parking and a pile of battered plastic toys in the corner. Every surface is hard, which will cause your child's shrieks to be extra loud. The pizza is good, but I would take it to go."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other yelpers, this place is awesome! Hands down some of the best pizza I've ever had if not the best.  The smell when you enter is amazing. Their ingredients are local and fresh and they have a great variety of toppings. Their pizzas are pretty thin and doesn't overly stuff me but that's a good thing. The ambiance isn't super flashy  but then again everything done at Pizza Brutta is simply done and I think that adds to the charm of this place. Definitely a must try in Madison!"}
{"text":"Good and very tasty like the fresh ingredients well worth the stop and value you have to like more authentic napolitan style pizza and this is more enjoyable for you. if you want doughy, american pizza...this isnt your place"}
{"text":"I really love great pizza of many different kinds.One of my favorite types of Pizza is classic neopolitan style pizza.  They do a very, very good job here.  its a place that combines great taste in the food with genuinely good food.  I really like that they use organic flour and I think you can taste the difference.  The salad was even really good here.  If I had any little nitpicking gripe it would be the proscuitto they use is domestic and not from parma italy but most people won't pay for that so I can bust their chops too hard!!!   Great place if you want to try classic well prepared Pizza"}
{"text":"Tiny, top-of-the-line flatbread pizzas served on a crispy, fire-licked crust. If anything you have to try this place just because there's no pizza I've ever had that tastes anything like it. Everything is fresh - and by fresh, I mean they make most of their ingredients in-house and clearly rely on local/organic farmers for the rest. To even call this pizza implies that it's somehow on level with garbage you get delivered to you on football Sundays.  Those other pizzas have their place, but it's not here. This is an entirely different category of food - no globs of tomato sauce, no processed cheese, no pre-made ingredients or conveyor-belt ovens or heat lamps or frozen crusts. This is the only pizza I've had where I don't try to suck out the grease with a napkin prior to consuming.  You come here for Pizza Brutta pizza, and what you'll get is as unique an experience as you could hope for."}
{"text":"This is hands down our favorite pizza place in Madison. Super fresh, high quality ingredients, on the best wood fired crust I've had. Just try it. Quattro formaggi is the bomb!"}
{"text":"So Good.  I was looking for some brick oven pizza and it was so good and tasty!  Best in Madison for sure."}
{"text":"Get a bunch of friends, pick your own pizza, and share!  This place makes the best personalized pizza ever, with their crispy, slightly brunt crust, and delicious toppings.   And the pizza is pretty thin, so you won't feel too terrible after devouring every slice.   You seat yourself, and then go up front to make your orders. I highly recommend their Nostrano, Diavola and Prosciutto Arugula pizzas!"}
{"text":"Took my kids when we were checking around for places to eat. The kids love pizza. The environment wasnt bad, pizza was pretty good. Not a fan of the lack of sizing options, where they are all basically personal pan pizzas.   Would recommend to others, will probably go again.   Like how pizzas are made in the open. And the ingredients are all local (as local as they can get on some)  My kids loved their little pizzas and ate most of them when most other places they leave so much on the plate when we leave."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here because we had a gift card. When we first walked in we didn't know how it worked (and it must've showed) because one of the employees asked us if we had been there and took the time to explain the process and the different pizza options. We ordered and paid and then decided we wanted to try the cheese bread (GREAT decision). They put it in right away and held off making our pizzas. A short while later it came out and we were excited. Our pizza came out when we were almost done with the cheese bread and looked amazing. The staff was very prompt, the pizza was delicious, and we are definitely going to return!"}
{"text":"I was really hesitant to go here despite the glowing reviews and top star rating for Madison pizza mainly because after looking at their menu it seems a bit \"fancy\" for me in regards to some of the toppings I don't even know what they are to be quite honest.  I don't consider myself a \"gourmet\" guy really but I do know good pizza so I figured despite the appearance of this place on here and how their menu read I\"d give them a try.  Well I\"m glad I did because this has got to be the best pizza place here in Madison.  I tried the greek salad (side) and the pizza diavola.  I decided to add sausage and red onions.    I think it's a little odd they only do one type of pizza size here but hey I'm cool with it because the pizza is so damned tasty.  Others have raved about the crust and how fantastic it is and you can add my voice to that list.  I think I seriously could just eat this crust by itself with nothing else at all on it.  It's just that good.  But that's not the only thing that's great here, the sauce is very minimal but just explodes with flavor when it blends down in with the crust.  And of course the toppings are all very fresh tasting and also simply are very, very flavorful.  The whole thing just pops of taste in each bite.    The greek salad was good as well and a pretty good deal for $5 for the side salad.  It was quite large and I feel it's a great value for the money.  Of course the pizza isn't too cheap since what you're getting is basically going to feed one person, maybe two if each of you have a salad and aren't big eaters but you're paying for the top quality here for this pizza, not quantity.    So if you're like me and not a real fancy gourmet type guy don't be intimidated or think you're going to get this pizza and think, eww what is this weird stuff.  Instead you should give it a try because it's really indescribably good!  And if you don't know what some of the toppings are, just use google to find out!"}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta normally rates four or five stars in my book, depending on the day.  For two or three years, their consistency was marvelous.  But cracks developed in that consistency and the Brutta experience has become more variable.  Last night I tried two new pizzas: the caponata, which was delicious, and the market pizza, which was very disappointing.  The market featured olive oil, Parmesan, heirloom cherry tomatoes, basil and buffala mozzarella.  The problem:  four little tomatoes sliced in half for the whole pizza.  Three slices had no tomato or basil so the taste was overwhelmingly of thin focaccia.  Market pizzas from other local pizza establishments offering it are way better.  No contest.  Lesson learned.  I will not be ordering market pizza at Brutta again.  Whoa!  Last night I did what I thought I would not do and tried the market pizza a second time many weeks after the first mediocre experience.  This one--mozzarella, olive oil, Neuske's smoked bacon, roasted brussel sprouts, and small red peppers--was 180 degrees from the previous market pizza disappointment.  Deliciousness abounded in a pie filled with flavor and appeal!  I hope this means consistency has returned and have changed the number of stars from three to five."}
{"text":"Ok.I have been searching for this pizza since I vacationed in Italy back in 2010.  Pizza Brutta blew me away yesterday.  I always like to go with the margherita when trying a new, Neapolitan style, pizza place.  Theirs was absolutely delicious.  My husband went with the Rosso Verde which was also incredible.  Both pizzas looked like they were hand delivered to our table from Italy.  Perfect amount of toppings - not TOO many, just the way it SHOULD be.  They were chewy and slightly charred, perfectly tomatoe-y and the right amount of salty  - just the way they SHOULD be!  Perfection, truly.  Staff was incredibly nice and I loved the counter service style of the place.     Oh right, and not only is their pizza brilliantly delicious - their gorgonzola salad was also amazing.  Holy crap was the dressing delicious.    Pretty sure I'm going to move to Madison so I can eat Pizza Brutta whenever I want."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The ingredients were so fresh!  I came here after work with some coworkers and had 3 pizzas, draft beers, and the Caprese salad.  My favorite thing was the Caprese salad which had amazingly fresh basil, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.  The pizzas were fantastic, but beware that any pizza with olives has every strong olive flavor.  I'd go back again for sure.  The quality for price can't be beat."}
{"text":"No doubt the best pizza I have ever had. The most amazing pizza Margherita that I have ever tasted in the US. Pizza Brutta all the way."}
{"text":"Huh. I guess sometimes you have to go against the flow. People seem to love this place.  That's fine, but we just visited Pizza Brutta and the experience was less than stellar.    Everything was going just fine at first. We ordered our pizza and a caprese salad. The Caprese was fantastic, large slices of tomato and a very generous portion of mozzarella to go with it.  15 or 20 minutes go by and we began to notice our pizza was not coming.  So we started to look around a little bit to see what was happening.  People who had just arrived already had their pizza and were happily munching away.  One of my restaurant pet peeves is being served out of order, but usually I'll let it slide.  This was egregious, however, as we were the only people in the place waiting.  If this was the only problem with our visit, I probably wouldn't have thought much of it. As long as the food is good and they address any issues, everything is OK.  Not the case here.  We asked one of the staff if they could check on our pizza, because people who had come in much later than us were already eating. This person let out an audible sigh, and went back to check on our food. I'm not trying to cause trouble, I'm just trying to get what I paid for.  Ya know? Sheesh.  Now, I know, my wife knows, and you probably know what happened here.  They forgot to cook our food.  They could've just said so, apologized, and cooked our order. After all, this is not a gourmet pizza place. It's designed to be quick and easy single serve pizzas.  It would've taken all of 10 minutes to fix the problem.  But no, instead the staff person comes back immediately with our pizzas. Why is this a problem, you ask?    Because it wasn't the pizzas that we ordered.  They literally grabbed whatever was on the counter, and served it up to us. As if we are supposed to be so stupid that we wouldn't notice.  Insulting.  At this point, though, we just went with it and ate what was in front of us.  Oh yes.  I should probably comment on the pizza, being that this is a pizza place. It's just so-so. The crust is kind of chewy and toppings are sparse.  Also, there was some kind of funky-tasting spice on mine that I found to be disagreeable.  I wish I could report which pizza it was, but I have no idea."}
{"text":"Cute, casual, good pizza. Margherita pizza is my personal fave. Outdoor seating available for nice summer days as well!"}
{"text":"If there's mushrooms, I am there. Shared a portabella 10\" pizza with my friend over lunch.  The pizza was thin, but very good. The ingredients looked fresh. Cost= $12 with no drinks, just water. We arrived right when it opened at 11 and it quickly filled during the lunch hour. I'd go back to try out the salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Good pizza. I kinda wished they would have used gloves when they were preparing our food. Not sure if it's a requirement or not, but it was hard to watch. The dude with the Cubs hat was kind of a DB."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend after working out down the street! The first big thing to point out is its convenience! This place is quaint and has a good feel to it. Woody, open, and with friendly staff.   We ordered the special pizza, arugula salad, and checked in on yelp to get free bread! When our food came out, you could tell that it was fresh just by the color of it all. the salad with all the veggies on top and fresh goat cheese. It all worked perfectly together. the pizza too was definitely fresh with the dough being rolled out in front of you when you order. The sauce was light and the cheese/toppings were packed on from spicy sausage, artichokes, ricotta, and mozzarella. everything fit together wonderfully.   Happy pizza eating!"}
{"text":"Service - fast friendly and overall stellar  Pizza - fantastic crust but flavors weren't right. The combinations I've tried have mostly been a miss, with the exception of the margarita with bufala mozzarella.   Space - lovely ambiance, tables turn over quickly because pizza only takes a few minutes to come out. Family friendly."}
{"text":"Rarely do I find true Italian Neapolitan pizza in the U.S. These guys are very close to what you will find in Rome.  Me likey! Me likey!"}
{"text":"Spoiled by New Haven style pizza in Connecticut for many years, I could not eat any pizza when I first arrive in Madison.   Until I was introduced to Pizza Brutta.   I have been a fan since my first visit. Authentic and tasty Italian pizza, real oven, made to order, fast service, reasonable price, can't really think of anything to ask from this place. Everything is just perfect. Plus, I like it so much better than Chicago's deep dish style.   Prosciutto Arugula is my favorite, but I have tried at least 10 different pizzas on the menu. Never once I was let disappointed.  If you are sharing, make sure you get both red and white pizzas so that you have good variation."}
{"text":"Thin oven fired pizza that was made from scratch. Would return."}
{"text":"I lived in Italy for two years.  This is the closest thing I have found in the US.  It's a little noisy sometimes but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I was here on Sunday afternoon and was quite impressed with the beer on tap as well as the outer crust of the pizza. It had a nice chewy inside with a wonderfully smokey and crispy outside. My only disappointment came in because it seemed that while they had made an effort to cut the pizza, it didn't actually work and we had to rip and tear slices off. If we tried to cut it with a knife, it just caused the cheese and toppings to be mushed around. Even still, delicious pizza and good beer on tap."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Neapolitan style pizza. It goes back to the basics: cheese, sauce, bread. Something about fresh mozzarella melted over good tomato sauce on a well cooked crust is irresistible. Both locations of Pizza Brutta do this well. The results are delicious. The feel of both locations is a little different. I would describe this place as \"suburban.\" That can be both good or bad. But the food's pretty much the same and that's really all I'm looking for in a pizzeria."}
{"text":"Cheap(not in a bad way!), quick and tasty pizza! The prices are very fair and the salad surprisingly is one of the best I've had. Can probably split a pizza in halves for 2 people with an appetizer and have a fairly filling dinner."}
{"text":"A bit overrated if you ask me. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but Natt Spill has brick oven pizza that is just as good if you ask me, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Had the beet salad and Sicilliana Pizza take out. Both were excellent. The salad was made with fresh mixed greens (no Iceberg or Romaine). Beets and goat cheese tasted great and dressing was on the side. The pizza had a deliciously thin crust and the eggplant seemed freshly roasted. This takeout was spot on and I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Madison from West Palm Beach, Florida, and was worried about the quality of pizza in the Midwest.   All fears have been for naught, as this place actually is better than most of the pizza places I've ever eaten at before.   The cheese on the Margarita pizza was phenomenal.   I'll be back, again and again."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta is a nice little brick shopfront on Monroe Street that surprises you on entry with a decidedly low-key interior. The benches and floors are dark wood, and stucco walls studded with small photos and images of slice-of-life scenes of Italy surround the 'L'-shaped interior. The space can be somewhat noisy as there are few soft surfaces present.  Unexpectedly, it is more of a cafe than a restaurant. You queue up to order at the counter -- the wood-fired oven is visible in the back -- and they begin to make your pizza right there. Then you take your seat and they bring it out to you. I had been expecting more of a normal restaurant place, but it doesn't really matter and this is probably more authentic anyways. Besides, you're here for pizza; ambiance is secondary.  And the pizza is good. I went with the 'Rossoverde' and it was a great choice. The crust is thin and simple -- crispy where it should be and chewy where it should be, too. The sauce was light, flavorful and savory; in reality, it's little more than crushed tomatoes and its all the better for it. The cheese, prosciutto and sauce were all in balance and the pie was blanketed in arugula; it was as if a salad was served on top. All-around wonderful.  They have a good sized menu with sauce topped and olive oil topped pizzas, salads, and a fair selection of Italian style beverages like San Pellegrino sodas. Beer and wine is available but I can't explain the lack of an Italian beer such as Birra Moretti or Peroni, the latter of which is excellent with pizza.  I'll definitely be back, and recommend you go as well. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Talk about a pizza for everyone! You can see all of the fresh ingredients going on your pizza and you see it cooked in the oven. Every time I've gone here people in the group have gotten a wide range of different pizzas, and everyone said their pizza was just fantastic! Enjoy a beer or root beer with the pizza, or take it to go home. Pizza might be one of my favorite food groups, and I would put this as top five pizza places in Madison."}
{"text":"Hey are amazing! I ordered a pizza that was too spicy and they offered to make another free of charge. I felt bad so I have them a tip ;) thanks guys for an amazing experience as usual!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good but it was so cold as to be unpleasant to eat in. I recommend takeout only"}
{"text":"From out of town so can't compare it to other Madison pizza places; however, I had the lunch special - small salad, sandwich and drink all for 8 dollars which was wonderful.  The sandwich was fantastic (Soppressata) with this amazing thin still warm sweet bread that was just incredibly good.  I haven't yet had their pizza but I'll be going back to try it!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a pizza in Madison that I could enjoy time again. Pizza Brutta has just the pie I've been looking for. Their wood fired oven oven adds life and texture to the dough. The choice of pies has something for even the pickiest eaters. I love that they use locally sourced ingredients. They have earned our repeat business."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of fast food pizza, or even pizza one finds in a typical restraunt. Pizza brutta, however, is a favorite of mine. The crust is amazing, the ingredients so fresh, and they make it right before your eyes. Last year there was an Italian exchange student at my school, and he said that he hated American pizza, but really enjoyed pizza brutta, as it was just like the pizza from home. The environment is relaxed but with a little elegance, and always nice and clean. The service has always been very polite. I would absolutely recommend pizza brutta to anyone. The only downfall is parking isn't always very easy."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Local ingredients, dough made from scratch, baked to perfection. The only thing I could use is a spotted cow. Oh yeah, they have that too."}
{"text":"Love the individual pizzas for our fussy family. The boys love asking for dough to play with while we wait. Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but the toppings were really, really lean. I ordered the fennel sausage w/ green olives (which my husband ate) and there was hardly any toppings AT ALL. Not that I want it piled on, but it was mostly crust. Not impressed. My husband had a half greek salad and the dressing was good. I enjoy brick oven crusts a lot, so this was right on, but wow -- totally skimped. Guess this Chicago/Northern Illinois girl is spoiled by what she gets.   I don't think we'll be back when we go to Madtown."}
{"text":"I think I haven't reviewed Pizza Brutta because there aren't words to describe how much I love this place!   The pizza is amazing, crispy and delicious, there are some interesting toppings but I am a sucker for a good margarita pizza, wow, do they have a good one.  I took my Dad and he picked the basil off...can't take him anywhere!"}
{"text":"Pizza with integrity sounds kinda ridiculous but these guys strive to deliver real Neapolitan pizza with local ingredients and succeed...in spades. The Salumi plate is fantastic and the Pizzas simple and delicious. With minimalist pies you can taste and enjoy each ingredient so each part has to be good...and it is."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get pizza in Madison! I prefer the thinner crust Italian/European pizzas over the American pizzas, and this place serves exactly what I like. But if you like deep dish or more American style pizzas, then you might feel differently but you should still try if you get the chance. The pizzas are made fresh to order in a stone oven and it smells fantastic when it comes out of the oven. My favorite is Rossoverde, it has basil, prosciutto, parmesan, mozzarella, and a fresh topping of arugula."}
{"text":"Yummo!   I don't give 5 star ratings too often, but Pizza Brutta deserves it!   I friend recommended Pizza Brutta for lunch after the Women's Expo. I ordered the four cheese pizza aka QUATTRO FORMAGGI. OMG. It was so so good.   My daughter ordered the kids pizza with sausage. I ate her crust. That was good too. Seating was available and service was fast, friendly, and helpful. Prices were super affordable. Pizza Brutta had everything...except parking, but we can all use a little excursive right? :)"}
{"text":"Love the food.  It is so tasty from the brick oven.  I do really miss the lunch special.  I have 1 hour to walk there, eat, and get back to work.  The half salad half sandwich was the right size.  Now I don't go as much because I don't have time and the left overs would be weird after my 20 min walk."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza right up there with Salvatore's Tomato Pies. Great, fast service. Awesome, clean, spacious facility. A+."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Pizza Brutta in early June, I wasn't sure what to expect. I ordered my pizza and sat down with family and waited. About 7 minutes later our pizzas came out. My mouth was already watering from the aroma of this place. I took a bite of my pizza, I was instantly hooked.   The flavors, the crispiness, the fact that it's all natural ingredients. This place is a favorite now, I've been there 3 times since and plan on going back soon. I'd also like to mention that Pizza Brutta is in a neat neighborhood with some cool shops."}
{"text":"While my favorite style of pizza will always be New York thin slice, this pizza crust was pretty amazing. It was light instead of bready and tasted lightly salted with a nice char on it that did not actually taste carcinogenic. The toppings kind of slide off a bit, but most of it was due to the fact that my pizza had arugula, which they add after the pie has emerged from the oven. The flavors were great and the ingredients tasted fresh. They have some great beers on tap to accompany your meal, and the ambiance is nice and relaxed."}
{"text":"I'm 4 months late with this review. We really loved the pizza! As great as Punches in MN. I can't wait to get back here. So worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Went to Madison for a weekend get away and had an amazing meal here. The place is super legit. Great, moderately quick food at a reasonable price, with a ton of different menu options."}
{"text":"I was sure I reviewed pizza brutta already. This might well be my favorite pizza in Madison (actually it ties with cafe Porta Alba). Only thinking about it makes me want to go grab some!  Anyway, crust is perfectly cooked (crispy, yet soft) and well leavened (light and doesn't sit on your stomach or makes you groggy). Toppings are well balanced and in the right amounts, with both classic and creative options.  Simple, delicious pizza for curing your carb cravings!"}
{"text":"They use fresh ingredients, a wood-fired oven, and you can tell they love what they do and take pride in what they serve you.  Is there anything more you can ask for?  I live 1200 miles away and wake up craving their pizzas.  Also, if you've never had fresh mozzarella, you will be blown away.  Get the caprese salad, which features giant hunks of it alongside fresh tomatoes and basil, all drizzled in olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt.  I'd recommend a specific pizza, but you can't really go wrong with any of them.    Pizza Brutta will change the way you think about pizza.  You may never order delivery again."}
{"text":"Great wood fire pizza. I always get the market pizza, it changes every month but it is always really good. This place is also really cool cause you get to see them make it and put it in the fire pizza oven."}
{"text":"We came here for Sustainable Seafood Week, and more specifically the clam pizza.  A Nostrano (sausage and red pepper) was also ordered, and I also unlocked a free Margarita pizza thanks to Yelp.   The crust on these pizzas was simply amazing.  Now, this is not the same as Pizza Hut or Domino's pizza crust (apologies for even mentioning those names).  The crust light and slightly crisp.  These pizzas are made at high temps, which means they are done fast. The Margarita and Nostrano were really good, but the star was the clam pizza.  If only they could make a larger pizza like this!  I loved it. The staff was super helpful with our ordering, as I've never been there with a home but myself.  They also checked on us to make sure everything was ok. All in all, this was a great pizza night!"}
{"text":"So I am giving this place five stars with a bit of a different review. I do not particularly care for this type of pizza. I prefer an American style and this is not it, but what they do was quite appreciated by my family. They loved it. The owner saw that I was unhappy and asked if I liked what I got, I explained why I did not and that I was fine. Well he went ahead and made a pizza for me more to my Americanized tastes. It was ok, but this type of customer service is spectacular and you should spend your money here. This place deserves a good review and lots of business. We will come back and next time I will get a salad."}
{"text":"I have to be honest:  I am not sure why this place gets rave reviews.  The pizzas are all about 10.5 inches, which is on the small side and they are charging prices that you would pay for a 12-inch pizza at even some of the more upscale pizza places in town.  The crust dough is quite good but they did not evenly distribute it on the pan, so it was cooked very unevenly.  Some parts were so thin, the sauce just turned it to mush during cooking.  The toppings are really where it goes wrong though.  Almost everything on the pizza looked canned - the sauce, the pineapple, olives, artichokes, pickled jalapenos, etc. none of it tasted fresh and was cooked to the point of dryness.  The only thing fresh on the pizza was the basil.  To top it off, you order cafeteria style here.  I don't have anything against that per se, but their prices don't reflect the fact that you aren't really getting full sit-down service.  Quite honestly, there are better places within a 5-10 min drive that are cheaper and serve better quality ingredients.  This is simply not worth their asking price and wasn't good enough for me to go back even if the prices were $2-4 lower per pie like they should be."}
{"text":"As much as I think the midwest is really the heart of ethnic cuisine in America, it can be very hard to find good thin-crust pizza in this part of the country.  This place is a notable exception.  The pizza here is a culinary masterpiece: delicate, thin, light, immensely flavorful, artfully constructed, and reasonably priced.  I rarely have pizza this good outside of some that my particularly talented friends have made me in their homes.  I simply cannot give this place less than five stars.  This place could easily hold its own in the thin-crust pizza capital of the world, New Haven, Connecticut, and I have sampled many of the big-named pizzerias there.  It could also survive easily in New York, and could probably double its prices there.  Without a doubt the best pizza I've had anywhere in the midwest.  A true asset to the city of Madison."}
{"text":"We happened upon Pizza Brutta while walking along Monroe St. I have recently gone gluten free and usually don't have many options when I eat out. I was excited when they told me they could make any pizza gluten free. The pizza was delicious! It tasted like (or better than) other brick oven gluten pizzas I've had. My boyfriend was impressed with his regular crust pizzas. He said it was probably the best pizza he ever had. I highly recommend Pizza Brutta."}
{"text":"Delish!  Very low-key Neapolitan pizza place in the Monroe neighborhood.  All the tables were full but the noise level was low.  We snagged seats at the counter which we prefer anyway.  We got: Gorgonzola salad: drenched in dressing so not exactly healthy but it was real wisconsin gorgonzola so it was delicious.  Flatbread: free if you check in on YELP! (I think the deal is for a free bread with oil but they were out) rubbed with rosemary-smells so good  Finocchio:  green olive, red onion, sausage with red sauce: the fennel from the sausage is REAL strong.  I love that but be warned.  I could use more red sauce.  Salumetto: Salami bacon and asiago cheese. We asked for arugula to be added on top and they did not skimp! It was so spicy and fresh.  Dinner came to 31$ and we took home about half of it!  Such a good deal."}
{"text":"The folks at Pizza Brutta CARE....  and CARING is what it's all about right? Caring makes good pizza, good business, good vibes, good town. Ask, \"Do these people give a S**T?\"  At Pizza Brutta, YES they do- an 800 degree pizza oven, nice people taking your order behind the counter, fresh ingredients right there front and center being put on the pies as you order and nice guys bringing it out to you in about 2 minutes!  I hardly had time to take off my coat and get my water w/ lemon slice. 800 degrees cooks that thin crust FAST and HOT!  They make their own fresh Mozz!!  I would put a touch more oregano in the red sauce but, hey, that's me.  This is not the place to go if you want a huge pie to share with 4 others. All pies are about 12 inches and made to order. No slices for lunch.  I can't wait to go try the \"white\" pizzas. A salad at the next table looked yummy.  Space is warm with wood tables and chairs and booths. Not fancy, just pleasing. Just fast, hot, fresh, delish thin crust pizza.   YAY for restaurants that care."}
{"text":"Best authentic pizza in all of Madison. Absolutely amazing.   If you are looking for something like Ians (big pieces, typical toppings) this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"We love Pizza Brutta. It's a cozy neighborhood place that's great to eat in or take out. It's also great for kids (and there are usually a lot of them there). Their neapolitan pizza is pretty good - the best we've had in Madison. Definitely get the bufala mozzarella instead of their standard mozzarella - there's a huge difference. My husband and I normally get the bufala mozzarella margherita pizza. I also love the cremini pizza, which is a white pizza with cremini mushrooms and caramelized onions. I only wish the caramelized onions were truly caramelized and not just grilled. They usually have a few local beers available. And, there are kids pizzas available too."}
{"text":"Very good indeed. I've had at least 6 different pizzas here and they're all fairly priced and well constructed. For me, the basic margarita pizza is the best----doughy crust, sweet and herby sauce, and dashes of cheese and basil for a great price. I usually get it with extra olive oil for the crust. They know what they're doing here, and I love the casual seating atmosphere. Their storefront approach cuts price and time, but not quality."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in Madison, possibly the best upscale one.   The crust is always done right, with excellent topping choices and ratios.   A little pricey, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This is a Chipotle-style food establishment that makes AWESOME Neapolitan pizza!  So good!  Only point is that we were expecting a sit-down restaurant when we came in, but otherwise loved it! Would come back for a \"quick good pizza\" anytime i'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"The place seems okay from afar but it really just fails to execute. The menu items seem contrived to me and the pizzas come out kind of soggy in my opinion. Takes a long time and the service was poor as well. I have been twice and I basically had the exact same awful experience on each occasion."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch when passing through Madison - excellent!"}
{"text":"So good. Love that smokey fire oven flavor. Such great toppings. And spotted cow on tap"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible magherita pizza with buffala mozzarella. Crust is thin, fresh and not overly chewy. Next time we visit, we'll be buying one of their delicious homemade baguettes to go. What a great introduction to pizza in Madison!"}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta may be my favorite restaurant in the Monroe neighborhood, which is a mighty feat. They make excellent single serving pizzas, as well as very good & reasonably priced salads. This is because of their ingredients. They locally source nearly everything, from the meats, the veggies, the cheese, and even the beers, and it shows. It doesn't hurt that they also cook the pizzas Neapolitan style, so it makes the crust thin, crispy, and tasty enough to eat alone! My go to pizza there is the cremini, which is just flat out delectably savory with the fried onions, mushroom puree, and fried mushrooms. If you can take mushrooms, it's a real treat, and it ranks highly among my favorite madison pizzas. And don't forget to check in there on Yelp! They have a deal where you can get a free bread and oil."}
{"text":"Right when I walked in, Chris, one of the staff members greeted me. It's my first time here so he was very helpful with the menu and very knowledge about what they have. I ordered the Hawaiana and it's so good! There is pineapple, jalapeños, some greens, pizza sauce, and mozzarella cheese on it. The size I got is a ten inch and it was roughly about $12. My first slice was great! The crust is not too hard not too soft; it's perfect. I would come here again and I would recommend this place for hungry folks who are in for a slightly fancier   I just saw their sign, it says if you want to have a party, they have a mobile oven that allows them to come to you! That's so cool!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Yes, it's kind of expensive, but comparable to what you'd pay for a pizza like that in Italy.  Don't think of it as \"just pizza\". Think of it as a high-quality, tasty entree, which it is. Salads look good, but haven't tried recently. Take advantage of the check-in deal!"}
{"text":"I like Pizza Brutta! Neapolitan they say and Neapolitan you get! The pizzas are fresh, the crust crisp and the cheese just right!What impresses the most is that, of the several times I have eaten here, I have never found the sauce or any of my toppings taste stale. I have encountered the occasional burned crust, but what is a little blackness when contrasted with a whole lot of good tomato redness?? The highlight of their menu is the caprese salad. The mozzarella is super fresh, the pesto flavorful and the dish is a complete visual treat.   Go ahead, get whichever pizza you have to, but dont miss the caprese!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been there twice and gotten the caprese salad (which was a special) and the pizza both time. It's definitely a delicious place to go :)"}
{"text":"YUM! Delicious and fresh wood-fired pizza. I like the casual atmosphere and the location on Monroe Street. Good variety on the menu, great prices, too. The Brutta salad is delicious and you can't go wrong with the pizza!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place with amazing delicious pizza.  We had the Margherita and Nostrano.The only problem we have no leftovers."}
{"text":"I love this place.  And thank god it exists because the pizza options in Madison are not good.  The crust, toppings, cheese, etc are so fresh, crispy, and delicious.  It's an easy place for kids, adults, etc to eat without feeling like a \"family place\".  They have a few good beers on tap and great salads too.  I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Pizza tastes great but the price is a little high compared to sizing and level of service received. Beers are ok but again, you can drink for less somewhere else. I love the bacon tomato pizza, and my kids ACTUALLY EAT THE CRUST! Haha! Thanks, we will stop by again!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in Middleton.  Good crust, good toppings.  Not a pleasant place to be, though, due to a total lack of sound damping."}
{"text":"So this is it, 500 reviews for me. And I choose you, Pizza Brutta. Why?  Because I love you.  Honestly, you are wonderful. In the past couple of years, I have attended an event at your establishment, celebrated my birthday there and really find any excuse to eat at your establishment.  This is the perfect place for groups, a quick meal, a casual dinner, really anything.  The pizza options are amazing and your pizza is made fresh!  There are always a few beer options but they are really second fiddle to any pizza happening.  Ingredients are fresh and local. I really like that the pizzas are thinner and nice and crispy. Keep in mind, that you order pizzas, not slices. I wish I could say more about this place, but try it out.    It is a quality, simple and delicious place in town."}
{"text":"I tried a pizza with arugula on it, can't remember the name. It was okay but very, very dry. I would try their pizza again but request additional sauce."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Great choice of ingredients (super fresh, good veggie choices).  My kids loved the buffalo mozzarella cheese pizza!"}
{"text":"Traveling from Minneapolis and saw this place on Wisconsin foodie show. Love the idea of organic ingredients but crust and flavor falls flat. Had the americano, the arugula prosciutto and the Greek salad. Toppings cut unevenly and I'd get one huge mushroom and onion one bite nothing the next. The crust is chewy but I liked the tomatoes. I recognized that coming from minneapolis with punch pizza we are spoiled and have a high high bar set and if you had never had superb neopolitan style pizza this would be a revelation however having the standard of excellence in Neapolitan style pizza in my backyard - the bar is raised too high.  Average."}
{"text":"Checked in and got a free flatbread, which was pretty good :) I wouldn't recommend necessarily ordering it on its own but for free, it was definitely worth it.   Pizza is decent and fresh, service is fast. Ordered the Rosso Verde pizza on recommendation of whoever took our order, and would recommend this choice. While not the best wood-fired pizza I've ever had, it is one of the best slices I've had in Madison and it kept well over the next couple of days."}
{"text":"If you love simple, thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients, this pizza will rock your world!  My favorite combination is the mozarella with portabello- perfecto!  Right now, I consider the mozarella with portabello pizza my favorite pizza ever, and I've had pizza on the East Coast, West Coast, Italy...   Top if off, it's only $9, and comes out within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"I really like this place and my wife doesn't.  Mediterranean Pizza.  Good prices. Light on the toppings though.  Which may be good for some.  Fresh ingredients, lots of selection and  brick oven baked.   They get a little lower mark from me because it is a bit small and atmosphere could be a lot nicer if they were larger.  They are sort of part casual dining part fast food diner.  3 of 5 stars for a casual dining experience."}
{"text":"I love the oldness of the space of Pizza Brutta and that the kitchen is open and the staff is so welcoming and appreciative. And then there is the pizza...and what a pizza at that!!! FANTASTIC crust!! I ordered the Greco; olives, onion, feta, grape tomatoes, and oregano. BEST PIZZA I have found in Madison! This is good casual dining, order at the counter, get a number, grab a booth, wait for your pizza to be hand-delivered. Oh!! And you'll be thanked for coming in when you leave! How cool is that?!"}
{"text":"Wood-fire pizza, yummy. The owners have obviously studied how to make authentic pizza. The seasonal pizza are wonderful. Go there with kids, they will enjoy being able to watch their pizzas being made. Quick service, too."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta is a nice change of pace pizza joint that offers a light/fresh choice for pizza. They have a great wood fired oven that cooks the pizza super quick!  Toppings are somewhat traditional with a sense of \"originality/vintage\" pizza.   I think that this pizza is classic. It hits all the basics that you would want to find when eating a pizza just like you were sitting in a café in Italy.   From a choice of topping like mushrooms, arugula,  pitted olives, fresh mozzarella, and a great choice of meats, Pizza Brutta really makes a great little (single order, but I guess you could share) pie!   Huge salads.....make sure you plan to share this if you order one.   I'm not a big fan of crust on my pizza, but after giving Pizza Brutta a few chances now, I can honestly say I enjoy eating their crust. It has a almost sweet taste to it that gives it a \"I want to finish the entire slice\" kind of feeling.    4 stars because I wish I could have some more toppings. I'm a topping kind of guy and I want a lot of them! More cheese too!!!! It is so tasty, and I just want more for my personal preferences.   Plenty of seating!!!!  Order and pay upon arrival at the counter. Excellent wine, beer, and other drink choices.   Very accommodating staff!!!!! It's very nice to see a unique pizza place like this in Madison."}
{"text":"I've had many debates with people about the best pizza in Madison.  Given that there's quite a variety of restaurants and styles of pizza, there's a lot of room for debate.  However, having sampled nearly every pizza option in Madison, I can confidently say that Pizza Brutta is the best.  It's wood fired, Neapolitan style, which is different than a typical NY style pizza or a deep dish Chicago style pizza.   And it tastes amazing!   I don't know what's in the dough, but the crust is so flavorful.  They also provide olive oil for dipping and it's so good, you'll want to drink it.  All pizzas are handmade fresh to order right in front of you.  It's fun to watch, particularly for kids.  Many of their ingredients are locally sourced, which is awesome.  And they also make their own mozzarella.     As an example of how amazing the pizza is: We have two young children.  It's nearly impossible for all of us to agree on a single restaurant or type of food.  Pizza Brutta is the one restaurant that we can always agree on.  And the kids always finish their pizza without us having to constantly ask them to finish their meal.  It's a miracle!"}
{"text":"Our favorite wood-fired pizza in town. Tastes so fresh and the crust is the perfect blend of chewy/fluffy."}
{"text":"I like Pizza Brutta, but it's definitely not my first choice for authentic Italian pizza in Madison. It is a casual place, that does serve up good pizza, however it is not a place that I would want to go on a date or for a girls night out. So I'd say if you're looking for some good pizza in a casual setting, Pizza Brutta is your place."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta, ti amo. The bestest thin crust pizza with fabulous ingredients and fast service. I always go for the Rossoverde because the prosciutto and arugula are soooo dense with flavor! The sauce, cheese  and toppings are perf every time. Decide how much you're gonna eat before you come, because it's easy to gulf these pies down. And don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free flatbread!"}
{"text":"Really, really good.  Ate every bite.  Delicious sauce, without a bitterness or canned taste to it.  Crust is super-thin.  Try any pizza with ricotta added in; it's double delicious."}
{"text":"Just ate here for dinner. I picked up the pizza and by the time I brought it back to the hotel it was cold. However, the flavors were still good and the ingredients were pretty fresh. Sometimes... cold pizza just hits the spot. Really friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Seriously, just take my money @_@ this place has great pizza. The Neapolitan style crust is perfectly charred, crispy yet chewy, and oh so delicious. Top that with prosciutto, arugula, mozzarella, red onions, and olive oil, and we're golden. I liked that the arugula, though not baked into the pizza, was not overwhelming as it can sometimes be. The balance between the bitter and salty was just right.   I also sampled the diavola from my friend and that was pretty good, too. The tomato sauce worked very well with the peppercini (kinda spicy!) and salami (yum).  The only thing was that it was a bit crowded when we got there with no open tables in sight, but the turnover rate is pretty fast so we were able to get a table by the time we got our first pizza.  At some point the line almost got to the door, but it quickly shrunk because of how fast they were at churning out pizzas.  Oh and apparently on Wednesdays if you order a bottle of wine you get a free margherita pizza. I guess I know where I'm going this week :P"}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta.  Ohh, Pizza Brutta.  So many questions: how can pizza, which is already amazing, be *that* amazing?  Why can't pizza Brutta deliver to my 60640 Chicago zip code?  Why did I have to be torn away from that magical place, only to dream of it day after day after day, plotting my return to Madison, Wisconsin?  You walk in and straightway you're faced with their big brick oven.  Overwhelmed by the smell of perfect pizza.  It's reasonably priced, considering what you get: fresh, brick-oven pizza with fresh veggies, $7-$10.  They've got beer and a nice rotation of wines.  A good amount of seating: the place can get crowded and a bit cozy, but it's not one of those irritating family places (although there were a couple loud kids there one time we went).  My boyfriend and I were so overwhelmed by our dinner there that we went straight back the next day for lunch.  And would have returned forever after had we not actually been required to return home for school on Monday.  Oh man, I am definitely, definitely coming back to Madison to eat here again.  It was months ago but like all true love, it's unforgettable."}
{"text":"Good brick oven pizza. Ingredients very fresh and tasty. Only complaint is sometimes the pizza gets greasy and soggy."}
{"text":"Inconsistent quality and service costs them a star.  First marinara pizza was a five star -- needed more blistering and they should replace basil with oregano, but the charring was absolutely perfect, as was the sauce -- best sauce ever.  Second marinara pizza was only 3 stars -- crust was burnt.  Beer choices were 3 stars -- one so bad we didn't finish (spotted cow???), the other really good (red ale???).  Here with a large group.  Some orders were messed up and some corrections of those also messed up.  Overall a good experience, but we've had much better -- 4 stars."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh and FRESH! Outstanding food and unusually fast service (3 min for salad & app and 6 for 'za's). All in with drinks & salads about $10/p. If you're dining in - get your table prior to ordering. Highly Recommend"}
{"text":"Best pizza for 100 miles. Yes, Ian's is amazing drunk food and very creative,  so we'll leave that fight out of this. In terms of technical pizza, this place is perfection. I'm sitting on a beach in Napoli as I write this, so believe me when I say \"pizza brutta is the closest thing to \"real Italian pizza\" you'll find in Wisconsin. Also great is the fact that they offer a VERY solid gluten free crust for the trendy and/or sickly among your group. ;)  They have a brick oven on premises and a quaint little dining space. Not the best for big groups, but 4 or 5 is fine. The ingredients are all super fresh and authentic. As I said, I'm visiting the Campania region right now and pizza brutta would be right at home on any street corner here. The buffalo mozzarella takes on a lovely golden hue and the crust has the right amount of char. I like basically every pie they offer. The flavors are so diverse that making a recommendation would be pointless. Follow your stomach and order what you think you'll like (and you will! ).     The wine pours are generous and they have a decent selection. I haven't had their sandwiches, but the salads are incredible!  Get the beet salad!!!   If you want mac n cheese or a good old fashioned american style slice, hit Ians. If you want brick oven authentoc pizza but are constrained to a certain neighborhood or are walking, Nat spil and Gates & Brovi are very good too. But Pizza Brutta is hands down the best pizza in Madison.   Every vilas/Monroe resident and UW student NEEDS to try this place."}
{"text":"Its better than its competitor in Hilldale if you ask me.  The pizza is good, ingredients are fresh and I like its casual ambiance.  There are sometime a LOT of kids in the place but that's part of its charm.    It can get packed during rush times but tables turn quickly.  Don't be one of those people who grabs a table before you order.  You screw up the flow when you do that."}
{"text":"The best wood fire pizza I've had in Madison. The pizzas are served very fast and are relatively inexpensive. The crust is the perfect texture. Only downside was that the menu is relatively small."}
{"text":"Really sick of getting burned, black crust. It doesn't taste good, and pizza is too expensive for that. Salad was good, but hey it's a pizza place. The pizza should be cooked perfectly. I should  be able to eat the crust on it and not leave black hard crescents of bread on my plate. I don't even want to give these to my dog!"}
{"text":"Living in the neighborhood, I don't know why I don't come here more often.  Wood fried yeasty pizza dough with super fresh ingredients makes for a quick, flavorful, and delicious meal.  I was also surprised how good their beet salad was.  Served with goat cheese and ground pistachios, there won't be another time I won't order that as a side.  Super friendly staff as evidenced by the last time I stopped 10 minutes before closing on a Sunday night and the staff was still very accommodating.  Great Madison institution and great part of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza. Better than Chicago pizza even if you ask me!!! Not heavy or greasy. Fresh, bright flavors, perfection in the crust. Fast too. We checked in and got a free flatbread. We weren't expecting much from just regular bread but dang that was good. Good enough to pay for! The olive oil flavor is addictive. We got a pizza of the day and a Miele. I loved the pizza of the day especially since it had broccolini and I'm a sucker for that. But days later, I'm still dreaming of both. Perfect amount of heat, sauce, toppings and I didn't feel like a piggie when I was done. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful restaurant to have in the neighborhood! The Margherita pizza has become a staple for us. Nice lite fare on a hot humid evening."}
{"text":"Best Neapolitan pizza I've had in the US. Nice, modern, industrial space and friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you like Neapolitan, wood fired pizza, and are in Madison, this place is legit.  This place serves up the Neapolitan to meet this pizza enthusiasts expectations. The secret, of course, is the wood fired brick oven. I highly recommend this place for a quick and casual meal. The restaurant is quaint, the staff friendly, and the pizza amazing. You don't have to drive to Madison to get pizza like this, but if you are in the area, it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Pretty good flavors and a really quick dining situation. Nothing fancy, no love lost."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta is a family favorite. The kids enjoy their individual-sized kids pizzas (of cheese or pepperoni) and we generally try whatever the market pizza of the day is. We have never been disappointed! The market pizzas are loaded with fresh ingredients we wouldn't normally put on pizza it they are always fab. Last Friday night, when we were dining with a large group but in a bit of a hurry, the young man who delivered the pizza kindly took care of getting us another pitcher of beer so we could avoid the long line that had formed at the register. Awesome pizza m. Awesome service!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and asked if I could have chicken on a margarita pizza. Guy said yes but when I showed up it turns out they don't have any chicken at all. Also asked for pepper flakes and was told the best they could do was sliced red peppers. When I showed up I saw pepper flakes right next to the dough where they make the pizza but mine was already made. Finally, I picked up my order 20 min after I made the call and by the time I ate the pizza it was cold. :(  Pretty sure I just got unlucky with a new employee or something but the overall experience is worth just 2 stars."}
{"text":"It was a bit disappointing as I was expecting top notch napoletana pizza.  Crust was overly soggy and not nearly as good as I have had at Versace pizzerias."}
{"text":"One of the best iterations of Napoli style pizza I've had in America outside NYC. I'm a fan of the classics like quattro formaggi and margherita, but the most of the others are great too. I think the siciiliana flavors are too strong. One pie is enough for a hungry person. It operates and kind of feels like a noodles and company-tier place. I wouldn't take a first date here, it's loud as fuck   Don't be a pleb and get pepperoni"}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta is one of my favorite pizza places in town.  Their food is delicious and you can watch it be made.  Sometimes their flavors can be a bit overpowering (ex - sometimes their meat is a little salty and overpowers the other flavors), but it's still delicious. Favorites include the Cremini, Olivetto, and Rossoverde (pizzas) and the Caprese and beet salads."}
{"text":"First time at this place and I was happily surprised. I am a fan of really thin crust pizza and not thick crust, so I am usually in search of the best thin crust pizza in town. This place was recommended to my friends and so I went during a cold weekend night since I do not wanted to cook. I order over the phone for pick up. Prices are reasonable and comparable to other pizza places in town. The restaurant itself was quite full when I picked up my pizza, lots of families inn for dinner. I had to wait for a minute as my pizza was still in the oven, always a good sign, when it is not laying around. My drive from the pizza place is about 10min. I got home and re-heated it a little bit and had my first bite. Not bad for a re-heated pizza. I cannot wait for having one right out of the oven though."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta is another entry in the Subway-style of making your own pizza. You can choose one of their pre-designed pizzas or make your own and have it ready-to-eat in five minutes or so...that's right, fast food pizza. Either way all the ingredients are fresh...including the dough for the crusts.  The style of pizza here is one where the toppings are not heaped on with a ladle. The pizzas are not Chicago-style deep dish pies with four pounds of cheese on them but rather a thinner pie with a lighter application of all the layers which makes for a nice and very tasty pizza. Of course, if you want more toppings they will do that but their style is the lighter pie. All the pizzas come in a standard 10\" size, as per usual in most of these fast-food pizza shops...as such the odds are you'll still be a bit hungry after your meal.   Pizza Brutta is a nice friendly shop in which to schmooze and eat. Since it is so close to the University of Wisconsin campus it was filled with friendly and talkative college kids. The staff was very nice and there were enough of them to move the customers through the line. They also serve beer and wine to accompany your pizza. This was a good stop and we'll return when we are in Madison."}
{"text":"Friendly, local, relaxed, easy, and delicious. I especially recommend the tre colore pizza and the lunch special: half-sandwich / half-salad."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pizza anywhere. I thought I would never get decent pizza once I moved to the Midwest, and I was wrong, oh so wrong.   There are a number of places I love in Madison, but this one tops it all.  Fresh, and tasty, and great value, and amazing olives. I don't like olives, but I love their olives.  I just wished they would cook the prosciutto. I heard the lecture from one employee to another that it is simply not done that way, but I prefer it that way.   Also, in the past, I have gone to wood fired places and their pizza dough was dried out and burnt. Not here. Great crust, too!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, very crust and delicious I will came back for sure a lot of space to seat and a friendly staff 5 star for sure"}
{"text":"GET THE CAPRESE FLATBREAD APPETIZER!!! GET IT!!!  If someone only gets to glance at my review the one thing I want them to away is that, therefore I am stating it first and in all caps.   But really... it is amazing. They roast their tomatoes so they are warm and just starting to brown on the outside. Their basil leaves are diced up and made into this spread with olive oil I believe. Served on a warm flat bread and delicious mozzarella. An awesome take on the traditional caprese salad.  The pizzas that I have tried  Miele- this means honey which it does have but I would say this pizza is actually quite spicy with calabrian chilies on it, which I enjoy but just a note if you are thinking it will be sweet because of the honey.   Dolce E Piccante- I don't think they put pineapples on their pizzas in Italy but I'm glad they do here! I enjoy ham and pineapple pizza and love that they kick it up a notch with basil.   Proscuitto arugula- I was probably most excited for this pizza but it was the one I liked the lease. It wasn't bad, I felt like the others just had more stand out flavors.   Pesto- Delicious because of their amazing pesto. I can be picky when it comes to pesto. This one is delicious. Also has mushrooms on it.  Nutella- Nutella is always amazing, and it is quite yummy when served on their flatbread. I just wish maybe there was another topping on this? Marshmallows? Cookie pieces? A drizzle of chocolate?   Anyways to conclude my review...  GET THE CAPRESE FLATBREAD!"}
{"text":"I am not a pizza lover -usually.  I don't ever plan to go out for pizza, it just happens. We're running errands and it is fast and so we eat pizza.  My husband, however loves pizza. I mean, LOVES pizza. He loves deep dish pizza, which is my least favorite. But, like most pizza lovers, he just loves any type of pizza. If I'm to have pizza, I prefer it thin . This is why I loved Pizza Brutta. We were on our way out of Madison and my sister in law recommended this place.  We loved it! When we go back, we'll make sure to visit them. The owner stopped by our table to see how everything was, so that's nice."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta may not be the most well-known pizza place in Madison, but it should be.  Serving the epitome of authentic Neapolitan pizza, the pizzaiolo (pizza chef) at Brutta handcrafts pies that combine  moist house-made mozzarella cheese, hearty tomato sauce, and hand-stretched dough into beautifully charred masterpieces. Paired with fresh and flavorful toppings, these pies are not to be missed.  Two friends an I split two pizzas and a salad, which was a perfect amount of food for dinner.  We ordered one pizza from the \"Pizza Rosso\" menu (pizza with crushed tomato sauce) and one \"Pizza Bianco,\" a style that forgoes the sauce in favor of a generous drizzle of olive oil. Both were delectable.  Our first pizza, Salami e Funghi, combined the bold flavors of salami, crimini mushrooms, and kalamata olives with fresh mozzarella and crushed tomato sauce. The salty meat and olives perfectly complement the slightly sweet sauce and creamy cheese, with the mushrooms adding a smoky earthiness. The crisp, flavorful crust held these ingredients together beautifully, and was also delicious when eaten by itself.  The Prosciutto and Arugula was more subdued, yet equally impressive.  The stars of this pizza were the prosciutto, sliced razor-thin and layered generously across the pie, and fresh mozzarella, a familiar favorite by now. Olive oil, rosemary, and red onion provided a more subtle sweetness than tomato sauce, but were a nice balance to the bold and complex flavor of the prosciutto.  A pile of fresh arugula and freshly grated parmesan provided a hearty finish. And again, the crust shined in its own right.  Along with our pizzas, we also enjoyed a wonderfully composed caprese salad.  Thick slices of mozzarella were paired with roasted local tomatoes, a hearty crusty bread, and a generous drizzle of olive oil.  Refreshingly simple and quite delicious, the salad was a wonderful addition to our meal.  Pizza Brutta not only offers artfully crafted pizzas made with world-class ingredients, but does so with reasonable prices and exceptionally fast service. A well-deserved 5 stars."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch at Brutta today - it wasn't bad. We ordered two pizzas - we chose salami for the one we had with meat. I probably wouldn't do this again. The Salami added a lot of salt without any discernible flavor. The veggie pizza had better and subtle flavors.   I may be spoiled for life after spending a week in Milan where all the pizza was great - it was all wood fired, inexpensive and made with exceptional ingredients. But back to Brutta. I would be happy to go back and give it another try. I thought the ingredient choices were good, and the overall product was above average for the Madison Pizza scene.   I try to never compare a Neapolitan style pizza to any other type of pizza after reading a \"professional\" reviewer in the Madison area comparing her Neapolitan pizza at Cafe Porta Alba to the local Cheesasaurus Pizza at another Madison Pizza joint. She complained that that the toppings on the Neapolitan pizza was just to skimpy.  It's simply silly to compare a very specific style of Italian pizza to a uniquely U.S.-Wisconsin style of pizza. This said, I would say that Brutta out performs Cafe Porta Alba by a long shot. The crust at Brutta has a nice crisp bottom, but maintains a good chew factor and mouth feel.   Look if you are going to eat pizza, eat local pizza - Brutta is a solid choice, just not my favorite pizza in town."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison, hands down. Salads and sandwiches amazing too. We have long been a fan of the Monroe location, and the new Middleton location is in a big beautiful space with an awesome beer selection for the grown-ups."}
{"text":"First, I don't know how my committee member couldn't secure the Yelp Check In offer and it would have been nice for her to use since she got 7 pies for our meeting because I was able to use it during my trip.   Pushing along... all else I got to add is this:  MY SOUTHERN BORN & BRED MOTHER LIKED HER MEAL YESTERDAY.  (Margherita  free with Check In offer & Lombardo with no Gorgonzola add the fennel sausage @ $11).   Decided to get the Prosciutto Arugula $11.95  olive oil, rosemary, prosciutto, red onion, fresh mozzarella, arugula, parmesan MINUS THE ARUGULA ADD SPINACH AND BAKE IT ON for my bff awaiting our return. I think this meal made them hang around Madison 1 more day albeit he said it was the pain from his oral surgery. (Input suspicious eye here as the pain wasn't terrible enough for him to eat it. NOW INPUT LAUGH TRACK).   The new counter help was friendly enough but kept saying, \"GAL\" When I realized he said it to every XX table or patron - I brushed it off but meant to talk to him after putting my mother off to TJ's.   GAL is a racist word and when you start interacting with people outside of your color spectrum and age/peer group - just be mindful. I'll assume he meant no harm and probably doesn't know the history of the word so I'll get back by there this Wed. night and hope to give him a copy of The Color Purple (no need to get all \"Roots\" on him).   Just 'Too Close\" a la Alex Clare  P.S. Why does it matter that my mom likes this pizza. Honey~ if she ain't complaining (it's got too much cheese - her complaint on Pizza Extreme Chicago, the crust is too thick - in General even at CiCi's buffet, it's too greasy - take your pick...., not enough sauce - a la Dominoe's complaint) you must stand up and take notice. But IMHO: that Margherita is a burst of flavor for a minimalist. She didn't care veru much for it.   P.P.S. I told her, \"are you sure this is enough because it's easy to eat the whole pizza\" Her: How small/big is it? Me: The size of this plate they'll bring over Her: Oh yeah, this will be too much [Referencing my 2 pizza pie purchase] Me: Ok, so what should I get BFF? There's only 2 slices to put in the box.  Her: WOW! I ate all that. ROTFL well I guess it is good.  Me: D' Oh!"}
{"text":"Very very good pizza. Never had anything else there, except for the homemade bread they were selling one time. But I don't want anything else there.  It is thin crust brick oven pizza, where the crust is always airy. My favorite type of pie is the mushroom/onion white, but everything looks great.   I am reserving one star as I went recently and my companion had the special (with a lot of toppings) and the crust ended up being soggy. That was really a bummer."}
{"text":"Our favorite post-badger football game restaurant. We have some delicious pizza and by the time were done the traffic has let up. Love it!"}
{"text":"Any place that supports organic and local ingredients is good in my book.  I came here with a couple of friends and the cashier was very helpful. He answered my questions about the ingredients and recommended some awesome pizzas. There are so many to choose from!  It's pretty yum and feels home-made from an oven-fire. I think the best part is that because the ingredients are so fresh, it tastes homey.   Would highly recommend this place for a first date or casual get-together. Something about the vibe of the place feels intimate and vaguely romantic. Maybe it's the colors or the pictures on the wall."}
{"text":"There are two kinds of restaurant pizza. There is the American style, which we're all familiar with: huge pizzas to feed a family, pre cut into wedges, delivered, cheesy, meaty, saucy, taking outrageous and good toppings like sauerkraut. American pizza is awesome!  Then there's the pizza of western Europe. It's a dinner for one in a restaurant, uncut, very high quality ingredients, especially the cheese. The crust has a very different texture. The top has burn marks from the intense wood heat.  It's knife and fork food and you have to eat it as soon as it's out of the oven. Delivery is not suitable. European pizza is awesome!  Pizza Brutta is this second type of pizza, which is a totally different dish from the American one. Every negativity I've read in reviews about this place was from someone not getting something that they were expecting, which comes from that first kind of pizza place.  This guy is officially trained in Naples, the capital of European pizzas. These places are rare in the US. Please support them.  I had a margherita pizza with buffalo mozzarella. It was more expensive than the others on the menu, but worth it. I haven't had a european pizza that good since my honeymoon.   My advice is to go there to eat your pizza in house. Convince yourself that it's not pizza, but a different dish. Call it a Neapolitan open-face sandwich or something, and give it a chance.   This place probably has one of the best values in the area when you compare cost to quality. It's not an expensive place to eat.  I don't blame you at all if you're wanting American pizza tonight. In that case, go to Ian's."}
{"text":"I gave the original location 5 stars. Again, a lot of the negativities to this place seem to be coming from expectations of an American style pizza, which is an awesome but completely different dish. Again, this is the best food you will get in the area for this price.  The pizza here is an awesome Neapolitan style, baked perfectly with a nice char on the crust. Great ingredients for pizza and toppings.   This time I tried a margherita with their Wisconsin-made mozzarella and it was very good. I don't think you need to pony up the cash for the Italian buffalo stuff.   I was really struck by how fast the pizzas came out, I've waited longer at fast food burger joints.  Small selection of wines and beers but with just the right variety that everyone will have what they want, (as long as it's craft beer).  We got a very good caprese salad that came with a full size naked pizza crust that the menu didn't mention. It made the thing too big for us and we wouldn't have ordered it had we known that was coming.   I had a bit of a chuckle when a guy behind the counter tossed a pizza dough and it almost went over the counter and into a customer's face.  There were like 8 employees to three times as many customers. Most of them didn't really do much of anything for the 1.5 hours or so we were there. I just keep thinking, \"dude, why are you here?\".  I'm giving a point less to reflect the above, plus the bigger, scrubbed clean, kind of generic and sterile environment. I'm used to the darker, cooler place Monroe street where you get your pizza made by the man himself.   Make your menu describe the food better and make your staff pretend to be busy."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The brick-oven pizza is simple but excellent. The prices are reasonable and there is almost never a wait.   Probably some of the best pizza I've had in Madison."}
{"text":"Oh yes please! Best pizza ever! Yummy sandwiches and salads, too. All of their ingredients are so good! If only I could go there every day. Especially now with their bacon and brussel sprout market pizza. I wish they were open so I could go get one right now!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick and reliable pizza? This is your place! The staff is super nice and their service is fast! If I'm craving pizza, this is one of my go-to spots."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta sets the standard for wood fire pizza in Madison.   I've tried many of the pizza options on the menu and they are all superb, but I usually end up going with the classic margherita and a Greek salad."}
{"text":"PROS: Crisp, delicious thin crust pizza CONS: Runny toppings  I really enjoyed the crust and flavors of my classic Margherita con Buffala. My only complaint would be the runny sauces on top of the pizza. It may be a matter of preference and style, but I prefer my toppings to not slip off like water when I try to pick up a slice. Overall, delicious!"}
{"text":"Honestly....I love this place. Pizzas are great quality, super fast and super delicious. Simple ingredients and fresh. And the dough is also super great....brick oven makes a lot of diffeence."}
{"text":"Great wood stove flavor pizzas. Pizzas are a bit small and would leave two people still hungry so it is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, we had the Prosciutto Arugula, perfect dough, fantastic bread as well (good crust, a bit chewy inside, as it should be). Nice interior with exposed pizza oven, these guys love what they do so they do it best!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, and lots of options! A pleasant atmosphere, though the music isn't what I'd call a \"cool soundtrack.\" Really, though, they coax a lot of flavor out of simple and fresh ingredients, and they have a nice, soft crust. A great alternative to the greasier, junkier (yet just as tasty) pizzas from Ittza Pizza, Toppers, and Pizza Extreme. I probably prefer it to higher end pizzas served from Roman Candle and Glass Nickel."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with myself that I have never eaten at Pizza Brutta until yesterday. I've lived in Madison going on 14 years and I've wasted so much time trying to find great quality unchained pizza.  To me, great pizza is about the quality and not quantity. I would take fresh ingredients over too much sauce or cheese any day which is what I think you get with many pizza joints. You totally have a better appreciation for great pizza after you've dined at Pizza Brutta.  They are on the more expensive side. I don't think there was a pizza that was under $8 + the cost of extra ingredients if you so choose to add them. I dined here with my boyfriend, parents and youngest sister. Between 2 small Greek Salads ( great olive oil they use) for $5, 5 drinks for roughly $1.80 and 5 personal nice sized pizza's, the bill came up to $80. Quite a lot of money for pizza. However, taking in account their location and the fact that the pizza is made to order, it can justify the cost a bit. Still, I think they are a bit over priced. Extra mushrooms was close to $2 which is kinda ridiculous. BUT, Pizza Brutta is about as authentic as you will get to great Italian pizza in Wisconsin.   Pizza Brutta is popular for a great reason. The place was packed the entire time we were there. That being said, they aren't really a good spot for large groups. We got lucky scoring a booth for the 5 of us.   Overall, I really enjoyed my pizza and the atmosphere. I think it's mostly because you can basically make your own pizza and end the night being satisfied."}
{"text":"Great pizza variety.  We had the Rossoverde & Olivetti.  Very tasty, however 2/3 of the crust was soggy on both pizzas.  Need to take your time cooking it to get center finished.  Beet salad was really good.  Would come back."}
{"text":"I love and often crave true Neapolitan pizza that is cooked in wood-fired oven.  It's not your typical american style pizza - it's made with fresh dough that bakes into wonderful soft chewy crust in minutes.  They put on just the right amount of fresh toppings.  My favorite is buffla mozzarella basil and tomatoes which is called a Margherita.  Yummm!  they aren't grease or overly heavy.   The butterscotch pudding was a great way to end the meal...yummmy!  Sadly I live in the Chicago area so I only get to Madison once in a while for work.  But this is now on my list of places I must stop at when I'm town."}
{"text":"With ingredients like prosciutto and burrata on the menu I would be pretty surprised if anything tasted less than delicious. I'm super happy that they offer all of my favorite goodies to put on my pizzas! Pizza Brutta could take it to the next level (and star) by crafting slightly more creative flavor combinations for their on-the-menu pizzas or improving the crust consistency just a bit (I'm picky though).   I like how fast my order comes out."}
{"text":"Delicious wood-fire oven pizza made from scratch at the time of ordering.  Ingredients are all tasty, and the pizza is sure to satisfy even the most scrutinizing critic.  They have Sprecher root beer on tap.....mmmmmm.  After sampling just about every pizza place in madison, if not every one, I can confidently say this place serves up the best dish (at least if you like thin crust).  A little on the pricey side, but it's worth it.  Trust me penny pinchers, this will be far superior than your chain pizza slop.  Try it."}
{"text":"This review is brought to you by a serious hunger headache:  I submitted an online order at 7:47 pm.  I kept it simple and added pepperoni.  However, It is 9:17!!!! and my order still isn't here.   The restaurant is three miles away from my apartment and I still haven't gotten my pizza.  The restaurant closed 17 minutes ago, and I still haven't gotten my pizza.  I tipped 20% and I still haven't gotten my pizza.  I've washed my hair, put away my laundry, vacuumed, and i still haven't gotten my pizza.  What in the Madison pizza shortage is going on here?!  Never again.   It is 9:28 the order has arrived and of course it's not what I ordered.  Not only is it not what I ordered but we'll take a look at what arrived."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fun toppings but not overloaded like American pizza.  I could have skipped the salad but would recommend getting the bread as a side if you're a big eater, the bread is AMAZING, as is the pizza but if you're used to American pies your tank might not be completely full.    Service was super fast, it wasn't very crowded but we went on a weeknight during the school break."}
{"text":"The pizza had great potential, the ingredients all tasted very fresh. Unfortunately, the pizza was burned very badly and gave a very pungent bitter taste.  I've been to Europe several times, and this would be considered garbage for Europe."}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza crust was the real deal! Lots of flour flying around so not for highly allergic or celiac but perfect for me."}
{"text":"Small cozy establishment conveniently located on Monroe street. I was a tiny bit disappointed after hearing so many great things about this being the \"best pizza in Madison\" and stuff, but it was still really good!   I got the Margherita pizza, which is my go to at almost any place. The place has really great prices for their pizza - it's good quality for their price point ($8-$12 depending on which pizza you want). The pizza was great - I didn't enjoy the crust as much as some places, but I loved the rest of the pizza!  I'll definitely try it again sometime in the future, and it was certainly good pizza - I just have a hard time believing this to be the best pizza in Madison. My search for amazing pizza continues..."}
{"text":"Good value for a casual lunch.  A Margarita pizza with fresh basil leaves and 2 soft drinks for $10.50. The pizza (10 inch?) was plenty enough in volume for me and my friend to share.  The pizza is made fresh the second you placed the order and finished in the stone oven. It tasted good enough, but. I liked Porta Alba's pizza better.  Good sauce, but nothing special, and the crust is .. a-ok. The staffs are very polite and friendly. I'd give the service 4 stars."}
{"text":"If in the mood for fresh tasting pizza with a thin crust, this place has it. Our pizzas came out quick too."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. Before we went to another event, a friend and I stopped in to get a good base down. I was a little surprised by the 'stand in line' ordering. Very much an assembly line for ordering, preparing the food and wood fire grilling. My Pimento pizza was ordered and to the table in 5-6 minutes. They only have a couple of beers and wine available. I wish the selection for drinks was larger. The pizza was great. I love the chewy crust, the sweet tomato base and that goat cheese. Don't get me started on how tasty it all was. The simplicity, yet complex flavors of this pizza. Delish! Just the right amount of toppings too. I did snag a piece of the market pizza of the day. That was great too. But, that pimento pizza. It's made for dreams."}
{"text":"The family and I were looking to try something different and we elected to a visit to Pizza Brutta.   I liked the fact that Pizza Brutta fuels their brick oven with wood from sustainable woodsmen and that they partner with local and organic purveyors for most of their ingredients (free-range Prosciutto from La Quercia - yes, yes, YES!).  The kids, well they like pizza, so things were off to a promising start.    As mentioned by other reviewers, the ordering process for newbies is a little confusing.  Thankfully, I read those reviews before my initial visit, so I negotiated my way to the cashier and the friendly staff helped me place my order.  Yelp saves the day again!  We grabbed a booth near the over and we enjoyed watching the kitchen staff assemble our pizzas.  The oven kitchen is highlight of the rather austere interior.  It mainly wooden booths and tables with some Italian food-based posters mounted on the walls.  Definitely a kid-friendly venue.  In addition, I did appreciate the chalkboard that highlights some of the local suppliers used by the restaurant.  We ordered a loaf of the Italian bread and some cheese bread as appetizers.  While I enjoy crusty bread, I felt this crust on this narrow loaf was too difficult to chew through.  We partially alleviated this problem by thinly slicing the loaf and softening it up with the wonderfully grassy olive oil served with the dish.  The cheese bread was excellent, just a little too heavy-handed with the rosemary.   As for the pizza, there was a lot to like.   The tomato sauce was stellar - it had a wonderful balance of savory, sweetness and acidity.  The crust has both bite and chew, a hint of natural sweetness and serious flavor.  And the La Quercia prosciutto on our pizza had incredible texture, a sweet finish and just melted on the tongue.  For $12, the Rossoverde pizza was a great value.  There were a couple of negatives.  As mentioned by Liz B in her review, the crust was soggy in the middle of the pizza.  It was unable to support the toppings.  The Rossoverde pizza had far too much arugula - the bitter leaves dominated the taste buds until we harvest some of the greens from the pizza.  Finally, I wish there was more of that magical prosciutto.   In summary, Madison has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to pizza and Pizza Brutta does nothing to harm that reputation."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a casual dinner out.  The thin-crust stone fired pizzas are made with excellent, fresh, simple ingredients. This is NOT your pizza chain kind of pizza.  The person at the counter was incredibly helpful in guiding us on our selection, since we had never been there before. I'm definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Went to Pizza Brutta for a weeknight dinner with a friend and it was delicious. They have a variety of unique and fresh toppings and ingredients, making it fun to decide what you want to order. The one thing I would say was that the staff was a little off-putting, but we didn't have to deal with them much. I would recommend Bruttas for sure! Brick oven makes the pizza even more delicious."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place. Its logo is cool and hip and Novantis turned me on to thin crust oven fired pizza. Pizza Brutte! Where did you hide the flavor?! The topping were good. Fresh, cooked well and well paired. The crust? Its basically a cracker. Remember the obvious lack of flavor in water crackers? Add some smoke taste to thay and you got it. Crust I get though. Its a flavor carrier. The real tell is The Sauce. Im pretty sure they got in a batch of homogenized flavorless trucked in tomatoes. The sauce was just texture. It was bright andnsassy, or smokey or sweet. It was just... sauce.  They get 3 stars though for decore, service, and toppings!"}
{"text":"Love brick oven pizza (I have on in my backyard!)  Pizza Brutta disappoints greatly.  Crust is suprisingly below average.  Toppings are average.  Many better places to go for good pizza.  I have been here four or five times and have been dissappointed each and every time."}
{"text":"Any place that has a check-in offer for a free pizza is a-ok in my book! Sure you have to buy another pizza to get the free pizza, but whatevs... 2 incredibly tasty Neapolitan pizzas for around 10 bucks? Yes please!"}
{"text":"I'd give them 70% if yelp used a 10 star rating system, but since that's not possible, and owing to the small size of their pizza and the steep price you must pay for it, I have to limit this to only three stars.  Friends of mine who are near pizza-fanatics suggested we check this place out and compare their pizza with that we've had at other locations, like the Greenbush Bar on Regent Street.  Well, the pizza was good, and baked in a raging inferno of an oven, but they're small, and pricey, and I think better value can be had elsewhere.  I'm not a fan of the mass marketed pizza chains; my partner has shown me the wisdom of \"real\" pizza versus cardboard box delivery American tomato pies.  Pizza Brutta does a great job of what they're making, and if the pizza alone were the only parameter, they'd score high.  But you have to also consider value, and for me, that's where they're missing the mark.  Just one person's opinion, but if the pie is going to be that small, the price should be quite that high.  Is rent on Monroe Street so high that prices need to be, too?   Other businesses on the street suggest otherwise.  For the pizza, 95%, but for service and price, I've got to bring the overall rating down to 60%."}
{"text":"Good food and good service.  A nice variety of pizza and salads delivered in a clean and inviting atmosphere.  Outside seating is also available and can be less noisy if the inside area is full. This location (north Middleton) is a wonderful option for those in search of a non-chain dining venue serving up handmade pies in an efficient and delicious manner......Pizza Brutta is firmly affixed in my restaurant rotation!"}
{"text":"I've been here at least two dozen times since I moved to Madison a year and a half ago, so it was about time I gave Pizza Brutta a review.  I've eaten several of both the rosso and bianco offerings.  While nothing has absolutely blown me away, the pies are very good.  Brutta uses good quality ingredients, which make a huge difference in a pie.  My favorites are the procuitto and arugula and the nostrano.  My only complaint is that sometimes the crust gets a little soggy.  It'd also be nice if they offered pies with guanciale and speck......my favorite cured meats.  Service is always fast and friendly, and the prices are excellent as well.  Overall, Brutta deserves four stars, in my view.  I'm also comparing it to pizza joints in other cities, such as Mozza (my gold standard), Delfina, and Keste, so I'm holding them to a higher standard!    Great place and definitely worth your while to try out!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!  Came for lunch with family - didn't know what to expect when we walked in and saw the ordering counter.  However, the staff was patient with our confusion and helpful with the menu.  The food was incredible, everyone loved it!  The Bianca pizza was an especially big hit.  I also enjoyed the Caprese sandwich with the fresh mozzarella.  All of the pizzas are made using organic flour and house-made mozzarella.  The handmade and local ingredients truly make a difference.    Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Still love this place! I've been here several times and always had a great experience. The thin crust is perfectly fired, to the point where it is crispy and crunchy with a beautifully chewy center. I've tried a few of the salads as well as 6 or 7 of the pizzas on the menu, and I've enjoyed everything I have had at PIzza Brutta. It is a little bit pricey, with the cheapest pizzas around $10 and large salads (good for sharing with one or two others) about $8. I recommend ordering a salad and 1-2 pizzas for 2-3 people to share. The service is good and you get your food pretty quickly. Tables can be hard to get when it gets really busy, but people eat and get out fast so you never have to wait long.  Overall one of my favorite places in Madison to go to for delicious, consistent food and service."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop when in the Monroe St neighborhood. The fresh, wood-fired pizzas are delicious and there are a variety of fun combos and plain for the kids. Plus they don't mind adding or subtracting an item or two from their stated menu styles. You order at the counter and then grab a seat.  Seats are at a premium on weekends at lunch and dinner time and those are pretty popular times during the week as well. One pizza can be shared but I would be a salad to fill out the meal or order one yourself and save the rest for another day.  If you aren't into in pizza, their salads are worth stopping in for as they have some yummy options (like the one with walnuts gorgonzola).  They are pre-dressed so if you like to add your own dressing, ask for it on the side as the portions are liberal."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent and so are the prices.   I would rate Pizza Brutta higher if I could.  My gripes: I wish they offered delivery, table service, full bar and more food options.   Whatever...  The pizza has been amazing over the years, nuff said!"}
{"text":"I have dined here twice and been satisfied both times. The pizzas come out relatively quick and with a nice wood-fired char on them. The sauce is a bit on the bland side and could use a bit more flavor.  The price is good and its convenient if you're in the Monroe St. area its worth a try. Personally I feel like Porta Alba is the better choice for this type of Neopolitan pies but Brutta is no slouch."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the Prosciutto & Arugula. Good texture, fresh arugula, and you can see it being made and fired.  Don't like the water here (I think it's a Midwest thing), but the cherry bomb Wisco pop is amazing. Tastes like cherries, not cough syrup."}
{"text":"My dad and I were looking for a place to grab dinner. After reading the outstanding Yelp reviews and seeing the Yelp Check-In offer, we decided to check out Pizza Brutta.  We walked in and my first impression was, \"Holy crap, there are a ton of kids in here!\" It was Tuesday night around 6:00pm...is this when every family in the Vilas neighborhood goes out for dinner? Anyhow, we figured out quickly that you order at the counter. We walked up and saw the menu items on the board above the register, but there were no descriptions of each item. I then saw the menus on the counter and grabbed one.   We decided to try the salami e funghi pizza and the Finocchio (crushed tomato, oregano, pepper flakes, fennel sausage, green olives, red onion, fontina, fresh mozzarella, and we added banana peppers), plus the free check-in brutta salad (spring greens with an olive oil/balsamic dressing). The salad came out quickly and was tasty. The pizza came out shortly thereafter.   I picked up the first slice, the pizza flopped over, and half of the toppings fell off. WTF? I thought thin crust was supposed to be crispy, or at least firmer, especially when using a brick oven. So I had to use a fork to eat about half of the piece, until I could pick it up. This was my biggest qualm about the place.   The pizza was good, toppings were fresh and abundant, the sausage was outstanding. The staff was super friendly. I'd love to try some of their other menu options. Lots of interesting pizza topping combinations and the beet salad looked amazing! I'll definitely go back, but maybe next time I'll ask for the pizza to be cooked well-done."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza place in Madison, and I don't mind saying I'm a bit of a pizza snob.  Great crust - light, chewy, cooked to perfection in their brick oven.  Fantastic selection of toppings and some great combos - although the crust doesn't always hold up to piles of toppings.  But the true test of any pizza place is their margherita.  Pizza Brutta's has a bright, fresh, tomato taste which is just perfection.  Their simple white pizzas are equally good. Go. Eat pizza."}
{"text":"Wow, great pizza joint with amazing flavor. The carmel gelato is to die for! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Yum! I love neapolitan pizza, and this place does it well. I had their caprese salad, which was made with pesto instead of fresh basil, which was a nice twist. The roasted tomatoes on it, though... amazing. I love clever alterations to classic dishes. My pizza was a little over done, making the crust inedible, but I also came in 30 minutes before closing so I am cutting them a little slack on this. For some reason, the cheese would just not stay on my pie, making for a very messy experience, but it tasted so delicious that I really didn't mind. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good pizza place in Madison!"}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing! It is as close as you'll get to authentic italian pizza in the Madison area. Can't go wrong with the classic pizza margherita. Five stars :)"}
{"text":"Call me crazy, but I think the new Middleton location is quite a bit better than the one on Monroe St. Not only is it an excellent space (open, welcoming, spacious) with amazing wood accents throughout, but I actually believe the pizza are better as well. Now, the menu is remarkably similar and it's probable that everything is 'the same' but the crust on the pizza I had today had a notably better texture than what I've had before. My one complaint about Brutta in the past (always on Monroe) was that the crust turned out a bit limp, especially in the middle of the pie. The crust today in Middleton was crisp clear to the tip of every slice and held up under the weight of the toppings. It had gorgeous leoparding and there was a delicious but subtle char in every single bite.   Before I write too much more I'd like to have the chance to stop in one more time. Fortunately for me, this new location is right in the neighborhood, and if it continues to perform this well my family and I will be frequent patrons!"}
{"text":"I'm really confused about all the rave reviews for this place.  We went last night based on a neighbor's recommendation and the yelp reviews.   We ordered 3 siciliana pizzas, and all three were completely charred black on the bottom.  All had a charred chemical taste to the pizza.  The pizza oven at the back had smoke coming out of it.  I've been to wood oven pizza places before, and never experienced anything like it?  We asked the staff about this, and the teenage \"chef\" at the oven rudely stated that that was how the oven made them and nobody else had ever complained.  Whoever owns this restaurant should be ashamed."}
{"text":"The pizza and salad were really tasty and fresh. The brick oven is a nice touch which makes this place one of a kind in the area. Nice atmosphere, cute and welcoming."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizza from the crust to the toppings, which they incorporate local ingredients such as the tomatoes, cheese, greens, flour, & meats."}
{"text":"Terrific experience! My son has a food allergy, they accommodated to his needs and ensured all of the food was allergen free. The food was super yummy."}
{"text":"Wow! I have been there a couple of times and its some of the best pizza in Madison! I had the Salsiccia one time and the Diavola most recently. Both pizzas were excellent! In fact, the only place I get better pizzas is out of my backyard, where I have my own Wood Fired Pizza Oven."}
{"text":"Amazingly deli-sh. Go for the meat pies. (Pesto was not as flavorful and was REALLY greasy). Beet salad was amazing. Priced accordingly (not cheap)!"}
{"text":"Fan of Pizza Brutta since the beginning and still am!  My first experience with Neopolitan style pizza and the best. Pizza Brutta is ALWAYS good.  You know how sometimes you get an \"eh\" dish from a favorite restaurant? Never happens here. Friends have scientifically deduced that the best pizza option is an oregano pizza with sausage and goat cheese.  The delightful fennel sausage and crumbles of goat cheese, along with the oregano and mozzarella is DELICIOUS.  San Marzano tomatoes, house-made mozzarella, Harmony Valley greens...Brutta only maintains the best ingredients.  You can wash down your pizza with local beer or a Wisco Pop soda (on tap, sweetened with Viroqua honey).    Go forth, order a pizza for yourself, and be satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I'd rather give it a 3.75, but a 4 will suffice. The crust is incredibly thin and the sausage is almost minced. Besides that, the service is FAST and the place is excellent for children."}
{"text":"Nothing ever disappointed me! They have amazing pizza with that unforgettable crust! Need to try EVERYTHING on their menu."}
{"text":"Pizza Brutta had a \"Yelp Check-in Offer\" that we really couldn't refuse.   The BF and I were sitting at a Starbucks deciding where to have dinner and of course using our favorite iPhone App--Yelp! And we noticed that PB was offering a free Margherita pizza with the purchase of another regular pizza. We jumped in the car and headed over!   The crust was soft and melted in our mouths. The ingredients were so fresh the basil/spinach leaves looked as if it had just been plucked outside. The sauce was so flavorful and fresh.   I really can't emphasize I how fresh the food was. I will be coming back even without being bribed with a Check In Offer."}
{"text":"Very delicious pizza. I got the mozza and it was incredible! People are very friendly would come again!"}
{"text":"We happened to stop by for lunch bc upon check in with yelp there is a free pizza... yes a whole pizza that was delicious! They make their mozzarella cheese in house and their dough fresh! The service was great and it's kid friendly! We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"YES. Eat here. Don't ponder, just do it.   So good. Friendly people. Fast.   The Greco is one of my favorites here. Happy eating! :)"}
{"text":"These brick oven pizzas are light, fresh, tasty and made really fast. Love to visit this place when ever I get a chance."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison.  I always go for the pizza margherita, I find the classic pizza more balanced - other flavors are a bit tad too salty (tasty?) with all the extra ingredients on top."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Cozy and comfy atmosphere. Wood fire grills working in the back, delicious pizzas that taste like fresh ingredients! Such a treat. Here's a pizza that I can easily enjoy sans a multitude of toppings, although I'm certainly not opposed to that! But seriously, this tender and chewy pizza crust, topped with a tomato sauce that tastes so fresh and real, can stand on its own. The addition of their house made mozzarella is so luscious, it just takes it over the top. My favorites thus far are the Olivetto, and the Pesto (which uses pesto as the base instead of tomatoes).  I highly recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza, small but carefully selected draft beer offering, and great location.  Not really Neopolitan style, but different from traditional pizza (in a good way).  If I was a local, I would regularly dine here.  As a visiting parent, we usually will hit it."}
{"text":"Sooo what can you say about this place that so many have missed. This place is disappointing for all reasons for pizza and food in general.  So our Beet Salad is more of a spring lettuce with a tiny portion of beet and goat cheese. Not at all described appropriately.   Our kids pizza is more of lots of sauce with a small amount of cheese, which is exactly what ever kid wants right? WRONG!  Our four cheese pizza was burnt on the bottom so ever bite was burnt with no other flavor.  Worst of all you would think pizza would be able to have great crust, it literally is the starting point for a great pizza. This crust was more like a piece of paper with so much sauce when you pick it up it slides off.   Disappointed!  I would recommend you try any other pizza place! Don't waste your time or money!!!"}
{"text":"It was good, but I hear people talk about this place like its pizza raises the dead and turns water into wine.  It's not that good.  It's acceptable, at best.    Maybe it's just not my kind of pizza."}
{"text":"This place has awesome pizza! I love all the choices they have and they make a lot of ingredients in house.   I also like their lunch specials of 1/2 a sandwich and salad. The sandwiches are pretty big and the salad is fresh and plentiful as well. I really enjoy the sandwich with pesto, prosciutto, and arugula. I just wish they would offer sandwiches during dinner hours they are that good.  I hear they are opening a new location in Middleton... I hope it's true. It would be closer to home and I don't have to deal with Monroe Street parking!"}
{"text":"Totally on point for all visits!  Haven't been disappointed!  Their seasonal salads are super and memorable."}
{"text":"My mom and I are obsessed with this place, it is definitely our go-to lunch spot! It is easily the best wood-fired pizza I've had in Madison and the interior is cute too! My mom and I regularly share the Beet Salad which consists of mixed greens, honey balsamic vinaigrette, roasted beets, pistachios, and goat cheese which we swap out for feta. Then we split a classic Margherita pizza and our tummies are happy! We also enjoy our lunches with a tall glass of lemon water. The drinks are self-serve and I appreciate that they provide lemons for you to add and that the water glasses are of substantial size and material (I have a weird obsession with quality glassware... and some places give you water glasses that are significantly smaller than if you had ordered a soda)! Stay awesome Pizza Brutta, I'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"Local ingredients.Had the Fromalgia PIzza, house salad, and PInot grigio. All excellent. You order at the counter. Hipster Monroe Street location. Carry out available. Recommended."}
{"text":"some gouddda pizzzza, though expectations were high so ehh.  ingredients are fresh, kept simple. all about minimalism.   classic thin crust dough. twas good, but didn't blow me away. although I've never been one for thin pizzas (unless it is Ian's..they do their crust so right: crispy, yet doughy, so good). dough here was a bit on the gummy side?? if that's a thing.   we tried: pizza bianca - olive oil, basil, garlic, fresh mozzarella pizza rossoverde - basil, prosciutto, parmesan, arugula, mozzarella customized pizza of mozzarella, parmesan, fennel sausage  also ordered the caprese salad - tomatoes, basil, housemade fresh mozzarella, olive oil, sea salt ^^delicious.  not sure which pizza was my favorite. all were pretty aight flavor wise.  their pizzas are on the smaller size, so if you are starving, you should order six of them and you could probably polish them off just fine..*exaggeration*  I'll be back to see if they can't impress me more next time."}
{"text":"Best pizza around. Great ingredients and creative, but still classic pies. If you stop in for lunch, grab one of their sandwiches; Mozza or a PLT is where it's at."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place. It reminds me of Punch or Pizza Nea from my hometown of Minneapolis.  The salads are great, the location is great, and the setup is really nice.  My beef is with the pizza.  It just comes up short.  A little sloppy like they missed a step in the cooking process.  Maybe I am just comparing it too much to Punch.    It probably is one of the better options for thin crust in Madison."}
{"text":"What happens when you take a North Dakota Farmer with a meat science background? A pizza that kicks ass!  Pizza gets bonus points for being: -authentic neapolitan (they use tomatoes from san marzano!) -brick oven and wood fired (you can really taste it!) -fun, unique and TASTY combinations -perfect size- so you can get TWO and taste more (especially if sharing!)  -excellent service  I have had almost all the pizzas- can't go wrong- they are all great!  Perfect pizza in the midwest  (Oh- last time I was there- I took an extra to go and eat the next day- just turned my oven on to the highest it goes for a few minutes- perfection!)"}
{"text":"Coming here after being \"rejected\" by Bluephies that had lots of customers on Mother's day, so yeah, this place was our second choice, but not a bad choice.   Coming here for the first time, I was enticed by their wood and fire stone. However, I couldn't give more than 3 stars, because the menu and the way to order the pizza is a bit confusing for me and the cashier (or whoever taking the order at the counter) didn't really help me with that. I was given a long list, but I was unsure what to get. And she seemed to expect me to know how to order the food right away, like any regulars.  Luckily my companions who have been here often helped me. As I can't have any pork product, the menu seems to be limited. Still, I could get something. And it wasn't bad, I think. I remembered I ended up having all veggies pizza, as the meat products they have are pork.   I may be back to try something else, hopefully I'll be more an expert on ordering their food."}
{"text":"Not too shabby. Wood-fired pizza similar to Novanta. Got the Margherita. Was pretty good, but a little spendy, and the crust was a little thin for my liking. Great quality ingredients. I think I prefer Novanta's version but will give Pizza Brutta another try soon."}
{"text":"Simply the best!  My husband and I were in town, carbo-loading before a long bike ride, and hit Pizza Brutta twice in a week.  Yeah, it's that good!  I stick with the tried and true.  Their pizza Formaggio is sublime.  We also had the pizza Finocchio, with green olives, fennel sausage and onion, as well as the Rossaverde, with prosciutto and arugula.  The thin crust is devine!  So tasty and delicate.  I ate very last bite of food.  The pizzas come out of the oven quickly, perfectly cooked.  Pizza Brutta is the real deal!  It is simply the best pizza I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Never disappoints- just tried the Rossaverde with arugula, prosciutto, red sauce, parmesan and mozzarella... Just as good as the others"}
{"text":"Great pizza, can't compare to Sals or Grampas. I think the atmosphere is much more casual here and the prices or more expensive (if you eat meat that is).  So, just something to think about before choosing between the three!"}
{"text":"You can't beat walking into the restaurant and smelling delicious wood fired pizza cooking.  Employees were helpful regarding their menu.  I love their crisp but chewy thin crust.   Location looked brand new. All the tables and counters were clean. Bathrooms were also very clean."}
