{"text":"I love this place. Great selection of food with a nice interior decor ( Especially the skylight area). The sevice was fabulous and there was no trouble finding a parking space."}
{"text":"Last time we ate here was 8 years ago and we loved it. Very nice atmosphere and great food! We went on Sunday expecting the same and we were SO disappointed. This place has gone so downhill.

No more mood lighting, no more fancy chairs and tables and the food was awful. Tasted like frozen food heated in a microwave. Noisy, not very clean and no heat or very little in the washrooms."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place isn't already out of business.
We were the only people in the restaurant (aside from an elderly couple) and so I instantly knew the food would be awful. The only reason I didnt walk out was because we were here for a family friends event. 

17$ for food that seemed like it was out of the freezer and reheated. (I kinda feel bad for the people that paid for everyone's plate!). If I could give it negative stars I would."}
{"text":"I agree Sisters isn't as good as it once was as it now has new owners. 
We went once for dinner a few months ago and were really disappointed.  The food wasn't really fresh and it definetly isn't as busy as it once was.. 


We were married in Millie's House which is now unfortunately gone. As it was our wedding anniverary weekend we decided to go back and this time the parking lot was full, someone was having a big party so at least the food was moving and the brunch buffet was fair. I'd prefer to go to Ted's for breakfast"}
{"text":"Pretty good all your can eat place. Has some really nice roast beef and turkey. Supposedly has more to offer but we went on a Monday and it was dead so I am assuming that it did not have everything out. The rest of the food was ok but a tad on the bland side in an assumed effort to keep everyone happy. The staff was amazing and very friendly."}
