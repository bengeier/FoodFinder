{"text":"RIP off!!
Very small portion. 
Very bad service. 
The meanest owner ever (the woman in black)

We spent $30 for 2 takeout rice tonight and the owner refused to give me more minced ginger with spring onion when I asked. Wtf!  

I'll never come back again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the service and the food at Shark's Fin City at Pacific Mall. Will somebody please explain to me why a \"fast food\" restaurant takes almost a half an hour to make Corn and Fish Maw soup, and calamari?  Plus, the soup is not even that tasty, nor are the portions good. I feel we also were discriminated against because we are English speaking Asian, and not Cantonese speaking Chinese, and treated us as if we are stupid for not speaking their dialect, even though we live in Canada, whose official languages are English and French. For the love of all that is good and holy, do not ever go to this food establishment. To summarize:

1) half an hour to make soup
2) portions and taste are mediocre for the price
3) Ignored us because we are English speaking Asian, and not Cantonese speaking.

If I could give them 0 stars or a negative integer, I would."}
{"text":"overpriced and bland :( not worth the $9 I spent. Got the BBQ duck noodles and other than the duck, everything else had NO flavor. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"10 -15 years ago they used to be great, with the most succulent BBQ duck, now they are just another overpriced run of the mill BBQ joint. What happened?"}
{"text":"Shark Fin Soup, not something you normally see in a food court.  For the price, it's decent.  They do give you shark fin that's intacted, not the ones that were already shredded to pieces.  The soup taste good.  Service was helpful and friendly.  You do have to wait a little while for it though."}
{"text":"It is hard to rate Shark's Fin City.  On one hand, it is a rare fast food booth that serves shark fin and abalone.  The quality of both is decent given the price.  On the other hand, the portion is small compared to the other food booths at Pacific Mall.  In other words, you buy better quality food here, but you might not get full.

I ordered a 2-BBQ Meat on Rice for lunch.  The BBQ duck was delicious; it was roasted not boiled with water, and the duck was marinated well (see picture).  The squid was soft, but it was getting stale.  The portion was big enough for me, but I doubt a hungry man will find it so.

Lastly, the food was served in a nice reusable plastic container that I have gladly kept for home use."}
{"text":"I normally do not give restaurant 1 Star, and I'm doing so not because they are horrid. Their food is actually decent, but, for now, I HAVE to give them 1-Star for serving raw Shrimp Dumplings. That's just unacceptable after we waited over 15 minutes for it.
Hopefully, I'll have no choice but to upgrade the rating next time I visit."}
{"text":"On my second quest of the day, finding the best Singapore noodles in this mall.

I used to come to the mall as a kid and that's when I first started loving Singapore noodles/vermicelli.

I ordered Singapore style vermicelli (who would've guessed). It took a bit longer than most places to get my food, but that was ok. They weren't particularly friendly either, but we probably look like gweilo in an Asian mall.

Overall in flavour it was good, just a bit spicy, curry throughout and salty enough. The bbq pork bits were good and so was the egg. The downside was the pepper strips, as I'm not a fan of that in singapore noodles and the bell pepper flavour that it adds to the dish. Big portion though, so I can't complain that much.

I wouldn't go back, it was good, but not the best."}
{"text":"This place always line up when I pass by.
Will recommend to order BBQ food on rice but not other item.

The BBQ duck is so good.  BBQ pork is so crispy. Both recommend.

Food portion is big, I can't finish the meal.  Price is abit higher compare other place but it taste good."}
{"text":"If you want some 2-3 days dry age chicken and pork, this is the place for you! Everything else other than the rice is super dry. There's a lots of good quality food I'm pmall but not this one. Not gonna mention the service because the first time when I was here the lady is simply not nice at all. Now the second time I'm here again and the food is really bad. When I told the chef about the dry meat, he ignored me. I'll never come back again."}
{"text":"I happened upon this little food court restaurant in a Chinese mall while my mom was at acupuncture. \"Buddha jump over the wall\" was on the menu and I had heard about this dish in a B rated Chinese movie and thot I'd give it a try tho it seemed expensive ($26 CND) well it was Delicious and worth every penny. And even my mom (if u know Chinese moms who's super critical on everything) really liked it. That says something!
I plan on returning on my next trip to TO so I can bring it to my mom for a surprise"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and a group of staff were dealing with a customer's bill.  So i waited. The customer eventually left but they were still discussing the bill situation.  So i asked if it would take long and the lady ignored me.  So i said if it would take a while i could go somewhere else   Then she finally said, \"then go.\"  So i left."}
