{"text":"I used to live around the corner from the College Street location. On the regular, I'd be picking up half chicken dinners or chicken sandwiches to go, and occasionally stopping into their sweet patio to indulge in $17 pitchers of beer with my chicken.  Well, I'm now back in the west end and was pleased to see another Bairrada location ready to fulfill my portuguese chicken cravings.  2 half chicken dinners with a ridiculous amount of rice and potatoes comes to $24.85 after tax and will leave you either overly full or with left overs for a smaller snack later. This location also has a \"hot table\" type setup where they have various foods on display for you to chose from if you're not a seasoned veteran of ordering over the phone in advanced.   This location is newer than the College Street location so it's actually a lot cleaner (better DineSafe record too), but I did notice some of the staff from the College location working here, so you know there should be some consistency if you've ever eaten at that location, which is a good thing. The only downside here on Dundas St, no sweet back yard patio. Patios aside, tasty chicken at reasonable prices makes this place a score worth visiting."}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant and the woman behind the counter chopped 2 tiny pieces of chicken for a small portion.  There's more rice and potatoes but not enough chicken.  What she served is not going to fill a tall muscular man who goes to the gym 6 days a week.  Very stingy on the portions. Only takes credit cards.  No debit allowed. They have a no name bank machine there which I refuse to use.  Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Cozy athmosphere, great service, tasty food in ample quantities. We ordered bitoque and codfish and liked our choices very much."}
{"text":"I have gone here twice now and both times with big groups and this place is perfect for large groups that want great food at a reasonable price!  The music is fun and the staff is amazing!  Big Groups, this is the spot!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered for 12 people and the food was not good, chicken was dry, rice was under cooked and the uber eats driver was not friendly at all.  Will not be ordering again."}
