{"text":"Have nfl fantasy team, went to watch GAMES, wasted my time only showing g bay, chic, minn.  Have 20 tvs but only 3 games on, ask to c new orleans . . . Still waiting for them to change channel.   Great food but should not waste $$ on nfl package.  Won't b back, will try buffalo wild wings next week."}
{"text":"Fianc√© had terrible service her last visit and decided to give it one more shot for dinner. Walked in to the entry and saw the please wait to be seated sign. Stood there for about 15 mins with nobody helping us. What appeared to be the bartender walked right past us and said hello but never a someone will be right with you or anything. A waitress was helping someone at the counter further in and the other customer noticed us standing there and said something to the waitress helping her. Waitress didn't even seem to care and didn't bother to even make eye contact with us. We turned around and walked out. Will never be going here again and based on the high reviews for this place I can only imagine they are posted by regulars who might rate high enough or more like it get drunk their enough to get noticed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first on a Saturday afternoon and had a few beers. Tried the salads, great Caesar and garden! The place is clean, servers are friendly and professional. The owner is a nice guy and the clientele seem as friendly as the folks running the place. Only adds would be more vegetarian choices and more beer imports like young's chocolate stout, Val dieu, Sam smiths stout."}
{"text":"Took a group of 20 0n a very busy Fri. nite.  Had reservations got seating a tiny bit late.  However service  and food was absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"BBG's has really upped their game.  We used to come here often when they first opened, and it was great.   However, in the last couple of years, the quality of the items we liked best (soup, salads) were hit or miss. 

Came today for the broad menu and the ability to hold a conversation, but not much expectation for the food.  Boy, were we surprised.  The salads we had today were excellent!  Large, fresh, well prepared.  Two people also had the soup, and gave it high marks.  Service was good and reasonably fast.

Definitely a good place to come for good food and conversation, somewhat of a rarety in Stoughton."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere good service good food
We went in with a party of 20 on a Saturday   After a basketball  game  we had only a 20 minute wait! The waitress called out that each family should use their child's jersey number to order which kept billing later much easier for the group! Staff was friendly and food was good"}
{"text":"Six of us went the this place last Saturday night, about 9:30pm.  Wasn't too busy, as we sat in the bar area.  Wait staff walked by us several times.  We tried to get their attention as they walked by.  No help...  waited for about 20 minutes and went up to the bar to order drinks.  The bar tender was too busy talking to his buddies... waited another 10 minutes, then left.  On our way our, I mentioned to the bar tender, the horrible service, he didn't care.  Service was horrible, the food is average at best.  I will not be going back to this place ever again!!"}
{"text":"A typical american food joint with decent service and alright food. We got burgers and curds and were not exceptionally impressed nor let down.

I think thats how I'll leave this review, ambivalent. That well reflects my thoughts. As always though, take reviews with a grain of salt and give a place a try yourself."}
{"text":"This place is alway busy! The food was good. Prime Rib was great. My wife enjoyed her salmon. Might be a little pricey for what you get but I might be cheap ;)"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town. Great menu options - something for everybody in my family. The bar turns into a nightclub after 10:30 on the weekends. Lots of fun."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks. The bar can seem a little loud and unruly but it's no problem. No reservations are taken so go early or be prepared to sit in the bar and wait."}
{"text":"Wow they've got an extensive menu here!  Everything from pizza,  pastas, wraps,  burgers,  paninis, steaks and more 'dinner' meals. 

The parking lot was packed on a Monday night. 

Our group got the buffalo chicken wrap, Monterey chicken sandwich on ciabatta, bam bam chicken panini,  and taco pizza.

Evening tasted very good,  not like your average bar food. Everything was about $9+. I just wish they were more generous with their sides. I got the smashed potatoes,  which were essentially mini hashbrowns, and only received 7 of them. 

They have daily specials and I guess Monday was half priced pizzas. We sat by the kitchen and noticed all the servers bringing our pie after pie after pie. We were made aware of this after commenting to our server to which she replied,  \"yep half off pizza night\".

The food is for stars but I'd say the service is a three since they were mostly a younger bunch. Would have appreciated more attentiveness. 

Overall,  I'd stop and eat here again!"}
{"text":"For the most part food was good. Service was slow. All in all, I love the menu and plan and enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing service paired with great food, you can't go wrong! Specials were amazing! 8.99 for soda, soup and the main dish! I was in town for work, and hope to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm having a bad day or I simply just want something familiar to eat this is the place I go. My husband, my family, his family, my friends, this is the place we enjoy the most. It's cozy and offers a great environment to just hang out. Not to mention the food. 

THE. FOOD. 

So good! I love to try something new here every time I go because I have yet to be disappointed. I've had their burgers, sandwiches, wraps, appetizers, salads, pasta, steak, seafood, you name it. And let's not forget their fries, what are those things made out of, heaven? I just can't get enough of the food here. 

Also, let's time a moment to take about their bar. The bar is well stocked and their bartenders actually know how to make drinks well. *bows to bartenders* Thank you!

Another thing that I love is that this is the only place in Stoughton where there's outdoor seating at a restaurant. There's nothing I love more in the summer than being able to sit outside with some friends, delicious food, and a beer. 

Banushi's is fair in their prices and will not disappoint. 

There's only one con... their service. Most of the time, and I do mean MOST of the time, their wait staff is great and very attentive. However, this seems to only be the case during their rushes. Come in during a lull and expect them to take a bit longer and not come back to ask if you'd like a refill or to pay the bill as often. But that's my only complaint and only my opinion. 

Overall, good job Banushi's, I look forward to my next visit. I encourage you to visit and bring some friends and family (especially for sporting events), you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I thought the food quality and service were pretty good.  It is your basic bar/pub menu.  They won't knock your socks off but over all they do a good job.  They blanch their fries, soak them for a day or so and fry them, and I am a big fan."}
{"text":"We went to Banushi's tonight for our second visit and were again pleasantly surprised.  We took advantage of the 2 for $25 deal (1 appetizer, 2 entrees with 4 sides) and the serving were huge.  We had mozzarella sticks as our appetizer and we got 8 sticks with a side of marinara.  My husband got the house salad and home made soup (broccoli cheddar) as his 2 sides and the salad was huge!  It could have been a meal in and of itself.  The soup he said was good as well.  I got the chicken tenders and french fries with cottage cheese and got 4 huge chicken tenders with a good helping of fries.  My husband's entree was the ribs and chicken tenders.  He got 2 huge chicken tenders and what appeared to be a 1/4 rack of ribs.  My daughter got the spaghetti off of the kids menu.  We also got a basket of 3 rolls.  We left stuffed and have enough for at least another meal if not two.  

The service is good but my main complaint is that they do not pre-bus their tables.  We were trying to get food into 3 big take home containers and the waitress didn't bother to take plates as we were emptying them (and she walked past several times so there was ample opportunity).  We are from Oregon, WI and normally go to Headquarters in town but Headquarters has been very disappointing lately but I think we have found our new \"spot\" with Banushi's!  What would have cost us easily $60 with tip cost $46 at Banushi's and we have tons of leftovers.  The only thing they could do better would be to pre-bus tables."}
{"text":"The Italian Beef Sandwich was delicious as was my husbands fried chicken sandwich.  Both meals were served hot and in a timely manner considering how busy they were.   The cost was reasonable for the quantity of food received.  There was country music playing softly in the background so you were able to hold a conversation without yelling.  Will definitely return when back in the area."}
{"text":"Good place for drinks and apps or dinner.   The late night crowd gets a bit young and loud (okay, downright obnoxious) late night on weekends, but it's a great mix of people most any other time.  Not a fan of their fries, but there are other options and their pizza has always been solid.   Bar staff has always been great (we've never sat at a table, so I can't speak of that side of things)....but it's one of our go-to places."}
{"text":"Nice place, very good burger for me and my wife had the shrimp and they were huge and VERY good. The other 6 in our group  were very satisfied with there order and overall I'm sure we will all return. Service was excellent and prices were fair. Large selection of tap beer, 2 large bars, many  TV's. Make reservations as this place is catching on and very busy even on a Wednesday evening."}
{"text":"The go-to place in Stoughton.

20+ TVs and 2 bars makes it perfect for watching the game with your friends.  During Packer games, they will bring out free green/yellow jello shots for every Packer touchdown.  Go Pack Go!

There is a nice outdoor patio and two separate indoor dining spaces.  Lots of space for groups, but still intimate enough for a date with your special someone.

I've ordered something from every section of the menu before and have never been disappointed.  One thing I order most frequently is the BBG Wrap.  Try it!  You won't be disappointed.

The spinach artichoke dip off the appetizer menu is tasty.

Monday Nights are half-off pizza nights.

There is a banquet space downstairs that you can rent out for events.  I attended a company christmas party here once and was very pleased."}
{"text":"Came here due to a state hoops tourney. The service was outstanding. Food came out on time and was good.  If you are in the area check it out!"}
{"text":"Had one of the burgers and was not impressed by the frozen patties that had fillers in it.  Service was good though"}
{"text":"We stopped here after doing an afternoon on the lake. Menu had a good selection of food to offer. I got the beef fajita wrap and sweet potato fries and was pleasantly surprised that the wrap was toasted or fried and not just cold which made everything in side stay hot. Everyone liked their food and ate it all. Sweet potato fried were great. Prices are comparable to chain restaurant ( a family of 4 cost $60). Only negative was slow service, but we were not in a hurry."}
{"text":"It would be nice if the offered more vegetarian alternatives.  Finding a place in Stoughton that at least offeres a veggie burger is hard.  So far the only option is Deaks.

I tried emailing the bar about this, and their email address bounces, apparently they really don't care to get customer feedback."}
{"text":"Although the place is cool looking, it doesn't have much else to offer. The service is awful and the waitstaff are not friendly. If you want to wait forever to get your food order taken as the waitstaff walk past and ignore you, eat some (nothing special) food and have a table full of dirty dishes and glasses while you have dinner/lunch (because the waitstaff don't pre buss) Go here. It's clear all their waitstaff are unexperienced, out of high school and lack proper hospitality training. I'm not expecting first class, but as someone who works in the industry, I do like to get good service when I go out. Girls! Smile a little, it goes a long way and makes your table feel welcome. I will not go here again or recommend it."}
{"text":"I had never been here prior to this first \"check-in.\" I have to say I'm impressed. Stoughton has quite a gem in this place. My wife and i only stayed for drinks but our friends raved about the quality of the food. Plenty of space at the bar, and ample parking. Beer was cheap too! 

They have Stella, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed in our overall dining experience.  We stopped here on our way home passing thru not knowing any of the places in Stoughton, WI.  This particular one we felt was no good!  We were greeted and sat immediately after arriving.  After being sat is where it all went down hill.  So they sat us in a section away from the bar due to the fact we had our 4 year daughter with us.  That was fine except we all had sandals on and they were cleaning up broken glass that had been shatterd on the floor all around our table.  They must have had a bigger group that had left before us because all the tables were dirty and slid together.  No big deal things happen right?.  So then we went to try and order our drinks but never got any service or server to come to us after being sat.  There was nobody in the restaurant besides us!  They clearly saw us because they were cleaning all around us and I was swatting the flies off of my daughter every few minutes so it had to look like I was waiving at someone.  The flies were so gross we almost got up and left and went to the place up the road on the corner that we passed coming here.  Finally my wife went to the bar and got someone to get us drinks and take our order.  The young kid sat at the bar counting his tips and playing on his phone the entire time.  Even the kitchen staff was walking around playing on their phones.  Gross!!!  Nobody washed their hands!!!
When the food came out our daughter's chicken Alfredo had no sauce on it!  We had to ask for sauce!  Our chicken special was stuffed with chorizo and cheese had strawberries around the plate.  Weird and not very good!  The rice it sat on was over done and hard, the chicken was dry and over cooked.  My daughter never got her drink to go with her meal,  nobody came to check on us or get us any refills, my wife had to walk to the bar to get napkins and then the ones the young boy handed her were wet.  So finally I had enough.  I walked over and asked for my daughters drink and our bill as I told the owner or manager at the other bar our horrible experience.  She said sorry our staff is switching shifts right now as if I truly cared why I got horrible service...  We were paying customers expecting.  Once the new girl got there she was just in time to collect our check as we watched the rest of the staff goofing around and playing on their phones....
It was a complete joke!"}
{"text":"While there is plenty of space at this establishment, the food is only \"ok.\" Our sever was good, but the bartender (Stacy) who had to deliver beer because our server wasn't 18, as perhaps one of the rudest we've encountered.

The club sandwich was relatively flavorless, the chicken tenders were over cooked, the kid's cheeseburger was HUGE but not all that great tasting, the only person at our table who actually liked there food ordered a cheese pizza. Their French fries were probably the only thing I actually liked."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick dinner prior to a concert, and were very pleased with our food and the service.  We had two of their wraps (the cheeseburger and the Asian chicken), and they were flat-out awesome -- very tasty, the tortilla had just a little bit of crunch to it, and nothing fell down our shirts :-)  Our server was very personable and knew the details of the menu, and made it a point to get our order to us quickly.

Although it was plenty busy, the space wasn't as loud as I would have expected, so we enjoyed our dinner while watching Northwestern beat Mich State in three OTs.

Good atmosphere for a sports bar/grill, great food, great service, four stars for sure.  Next time we're in Stoughton, we're here for dinner."}
{"text":"I live right up the street and was happy to something new going in a beautiful building which had set empty for a long while. 

BBG's is an awesome sports bar/restaurant.  I have been there at least six times and food is always excellent.  The only only I did not care for were the nachos, which are made with the melted cheese-whiz type nacho cheese all over them.  

Burgers, chicken, PIZZA, and fish are all excellent.  Atmosphere is very nice, clean with tons (litterally) of granite topped bars.  Speaking of which, they have two separate bars here, one is loaded with TV's and is more of a sports bar, the other is a more higher end restaurant type set-up.

Bottom Line: I love this place and would recommend trying it, you won't be disappointed. 

NOTE: They seem to be PACKED on Friday and Saturday nights, and I have been quoted wait times of over an hour.  Something to keep in mind if you're hungry and looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"My friends and I love eating the food they serve here!
Everything we have ever tried tastes amazing. We love that not only do they have a lot of options but that each section of the menu (i.e. sandwiches, burgers, wraps, etc..) also has many options to choose from. 
Recently we took a friend here who is not from Wisconsin and has never liked cheese curds here. He tried the cheese curds that you can substitute as a side for ~$2.50 and he said that he actually really liked them and liked them enough to even eat them without dipping them in any ranch or ketchup. 
The one thing we have never been impressed with here is the wait staff. They do not seem to be the brightest or have a sense of urgency or idea of what is involved in being a good server/waiter. 
But even though we have never been pleased with the service we go back often because the food is too good to not eat here.

My friend and I have tried and enjoyed their rodeo burger. I liked the Gyro with the substituted sweet potato fries. And as mentioned above, they have AMAZING cheese curds!"}
{"text":"The jumbo shrimp dinners with two sides are fantastic. The Caesar side salad is really pretty excellent for a side. The shrimp are huge. Kinda noisy but it is a sports bar & grill so that's expected."}
{"text":"Had the Athens Salad. The mixed greens were white and the salmon tasteless. The tomatoes were mushy. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip and it was smothered in cheese with a lack of spinach nor artichoke. The pita and bread was tasty. I ate a pickle from a friend's plate and it was hot! Hot pickles? I told the waitress I was disappointed in the salad. She said that was that was  mixed greens. They seemed to be understaffed and didn't care.  I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Well let me say this, we are not from this area but at first site we thought this place was a BBQ Resturant. The BBG, we just glanced at thinking it was BBQ. Once inside this large open with 2 bars with lots of TV'S the food selection was great not to mention all the good looking waitresses"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times. My food has always been great. I've had sandwiches, soup, steak, Caesar salad, and drinks. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is new ownership so much as it's just a new design in place.  The building has a history of devouring whatever opens here, and from the previous mixed reviews and sentiment about the BBQ place most recently here, I'm kinda hoping it's the same guy.  It sucks to see anyone's business fail...

That said, BBG just opened fairly recently in a huge building.  There's a ton of tables inside, hardwood floors, two bars and a patio.  It's got a reasonable sports bar feel, and a menu designed along those lines.  The newness of the place was obvious on my visit (third week of April) if for nothing else than watching the servers interact.  I've opened enough places to recognize the vets from the new girls, the bartenders who think they're the shit, etc.  It's all fun to watch.

Ownership seemed to be in place.  Rarely will you see a manager in jeans and sneakers instructing service staff or talking to tables.  I've got mixed feelings about that, but it's much better than ownership that sits in the bar in a suit and keeps calling the employees over to them.  They seemed pretty comfortable with what they were doing.

I can't go into a lot of detail on the food.  This was my first stop from the Dane airport after spending the previous thirty-six hours travelling from Eastern Europe.  I had the Italian beef sandwich and she had a sandwich with chicken (I think).  My sammie was good, and decently sized, with au jus on the side and we both had fries.  Strangely, I remember not liking my pickle.  It was floppy, and I think we made a joke about being away so long that even the pickles are bored.

Beer variety was good, and they didn't seem to have a ridiculously overstocked bar (bad mistake often made by new places - you don't need every flavor of Three Olives).  Pricing on our bottles was fair and we left satisfied.

Service isn't worth extended commenting.  It was par, and our server was young and new to this.  She did well enough, and I'm sure she'll improve over time, as will most aspects of the place.

This is a long review for a three-star, but I think they can keep it going and hopefully survive through the summer and make enough money to get through the winter.  For the general local population that doesn't want to drive to Madison or Janesville...support your locally owned and recommend things for improval.  As much as I like Deak's, there's room for two in this town."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for lunch today and the  food and service was great! We both had the Black & Bleu Salad and it was delicious. We also had a cup of chili that was very good and our server said was homemade. I definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my family for lunch and had a great experience. We only had a 3 people in our group and they let us take an 8 top table during prime lunch hours just so we could be seated right away! Goes along way in my book! I ordered a turkey club sandwich and it was great. The turkey was fresh, cut off the breast. It wasn't the slimy gross turkey you get at a lot of restaurants. The place has tons of TVs for sports, it was clean, and the service was great. Well Done!"}
{"text":"I really wanna like this place. They have a monster bloody Mary and the best spinach artichoke dip I've ever had. Food can be hit and miss, though. Today my nephew ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger. It was so over done that a 16 year old boy sent it back. I had to do the dirty work to ask the waitress to take it back. (She never had come to ask how our meal was, and it wasnt that busy) she was nice about it, for sure. I asked for it to be done medium. The replacement took so long everyone was done by the time the burger came out. My nephew had helped everyone with their meal, so he wasnt hungry anymore. Good thing, because his second burger was again very well done. Not a hint of pink left, and dry as heck.  Sadly, I just paid the bill, and the server never did ask if the replacment burger was better. 

My nephew just read this, smiled and said they were both the worst burgers he's ever gotten in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Best atmosphere and food in Stoughton! We frequent BBG's between once and twice a month and truly look forward to going each time. The management and service staff are focused on customer service and ensuring a great dining experience.  That's just for starters!

I am a bit of a traditionalist in that I always get the same one or two dishes - but that is because they are good!  For me, it's Pizza or Burgers; the pizza is the best in town and their burgers are right up there!  For my girlfriend, it's all about the pasta, which she loves!

Ton's of T.V.'s, pool table as well as some typical bar games.  The restaurant has a large bar area with seating as well as a more formal dining room. We love the atmosphere.

Keep it up guys, you are becoming a tradition within our family and we look forward to many more memories and good times!!"}
{"text":"Met up with some friends for drinks and appetizers.

We had the spinach artichoke dip, onion rings, and deep fried pickles.

Everything was fantastic and the dj was awesome. Definitely the party spot on a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Had the Reuben with fries. Very tasty. My mom had bacon cheeseburger with baby cakes. Which are tasty. Server Christina very polite and helpful. Will be back."}
{"text":"We have been to BBGs at least 5 times. The food has always been hot,  very tasty and prices are good Portion sizes are perfect even for my husband who really likes to eat.  On Friday and Saturday nights,  you can expect a long wait. If you are the type that is happy to have a beer and hang out, you will love it. For children and many adults, the noise level is unbelievable and most children will cry if subjected to it. On Friday night two weeks ago we went in at 615pm and the place was packed to the point that there was no place to park, no place to even stand or sit while waiting for what we were told was a 40 to 50 minute wait. It was so crowded and the TVs were up so loud for a Badger Game that the hostess couldn't even hear my name and I was shouting in her ear. 
We left but were disappointed because my husband loves their gigantic walleye dinner."}
{"text":"Perfectly adequate bar food.  The fish fry was a little bland but perfectly cooked.  Service was excellent, even with a large party."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night during a winter storm, so the place wasn't really busy.  We had the fried green beans for an appetizer and they were really good!  The dipping sauce was just plain ranch, good, but not exciting.  I had the black, bleu, and green burger - burger with bleu cheese and green olives on it - two of my favorite things!  The burger was yummy!  I really wanted to try their onion rings, but they were out, so I got the cheese curds instead.  They were okay, but nothing special about them.  My husband got the Walleye and it was huge!  He liked it, but it didn't seem to make a huge impression.  

It was good food and good service, we'll probably be back again."}
{"text":"Came in tonight for dinner with my family and it was again a pretty decently OK experience. 

The food was really good tonight. I had the Asian salad which comes with chicken, mandarin orange slices, almond slivers and a tasty dressing. It was good, but it was really wet. There was a lot of watery sogginess at the bottom of the bowl. 

Service was alright. We were sat right away despite them being very busy. The bar side was pretty full, basketball game on all the tvs. We sat in the dining room side. It was quieter and less full. 

Our server was nice enough. She seemed a little flustered or something, asked a lot of the same questions multiple times. We giggled about that. 

I still think the pizza is the best thing on their menu, although no one in my group ordered one. They take a while and we were hungry!"}
