{"text":"Really great value and everything seems super fresh. Good variety of sides available."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. I advise anyone reading this to stay away - far away. I ordered 3 Chicken Shawarma Plates and cannot put into words what was brought to me.

Mushy and cold microwaved potatoes - clumpy and cold rice - and get this....NO CHICKEN.

I called the restaurant and I was told someone would get back to me within 5 minutes. After 30 minutes of waiting I decided to take things into my own hands and contacted JustEat. They ended contacting the restaurant (I could hear everything) and they REFUSED to refund my money and spoke very aggressively. 

Do not order from this place...they do not make good middle eastern food and have absolutely no idea how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok! Just have to say the beef Shawarma wasn't as I expected... too salty! The mixture of the fillings do not compliment the meats! Would not buy again..."}
{"text":"Tasteless food, delivery guy refused to come upstairs and made me go down 50 floors, and on top of that they forgot to include the drinks. Would not have cared about any of it if at least the food didn't taste like cardboard...."}
{"text":"I just had the falafel wrap and for the price of $4.99 it was a steal.  All the ingredients and vegetables were fresh and the restaurant is extremely clean.   The size of the wrap is large in comparison to what you will get other local shawarma places for the same price.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"New location for Ziggy's shawarma place. It's a small space with a booth and table for 4 inside. The chicken shawarma was good, pretty standard toppings and sauces with everything freshly made. They even serve vegetarian moussaka & jerk shawarma which I will try next time. Shawarma was definitely a solid 3.5 star and satisfying. The owners were quite friendly which makes the experience even more special."}
{"text":"Ordered yesterday on foodora (not sponsored unfortunately lol) for me and hubby and no regrets!! Large plates and the food tastes amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the falafel wraps. But I notice that when I went to order the beef shawarma last week, it came out of the microwave. I also saw there was only 1 rotisserie, which was used for chicken. So I'm not sure if all the beef comes microwave or just my order."}
{"text":"Eric and I eat at Bathurst and Bloor every Tuesday, most often at Sushi on Bloor and, when in the mood for shawarma, at Al Ghazale.  All of that changes now.  We must add Ziggy's to the Top Three in the Annex/Mirvish Village section of town.  We were attracted by the \"Jerk Chicken Shawarma\" sign.  who wouldn't be intrigued by this fusion of Old World and New World?  The Shawarma Plate included this spicy shawarma polus three salads or sides.  I had the roasted eggplant, mushrooms and peppers and baked cauliflower.  Eric had one of the cold cabbage-based salads in lieu of one of these sides.  We each had a lentil soup and a side of hummus, just to cool our palates from the jerk spices, along with a pita.  The food was very tasty and, even though it's closer to dinner than lunch as I write this, I can't think of eating more food.  
The owners (I doubt either was named Ziggy at birth) make their own tahini and bake the baklava downstairs!
Ziggy's is my go-to place now for a delicious and filling meal!!"}
{"text":"Lovely place to eat filling meals for a decent price. They open till 3 or 4am so if you are a night owl, this would be a great place to go for a late night snack. The portions are decent and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I stopped in for some veggie lunch, ordered a falafel.  Everything was fresh and the falafel were cooked as I waited. They offered me a piece of baklava, omg so good I bought a box of it. Going back here for sure."}
