{"text":"Cheap and decent Korean restaurant in Yorkville.  If you are really in the mood for Korean food for lunch during the weekdays, this is probably one of the few places in Yorkville. I ordered the Kimchi fried rice. It took quite a long time for the dish to be prepared, but in the end it satisfied my basic needs."}
{"text":"Hands down to this small Korean stall, they have amazing soups!"}
{"text":"Well, if this were an actual Korean restaurant and not just a food stall, it'd probably get 2.5 stars.  However, being just a food stall in a dingy food court, it gets 3.5 stars from me because:   a) They serve fresh, piping hot Korean soup, including the common Gamjatang/PBS (pork bone soup). I find this quite rare for food courts in this area of town.  b) They have like your typical Korean fast food on warmers like glass noodles,spicy fried pork, etc.    c) It probably is one of the better Korean food places within 200m of Yonge/Bloor since there aren't many other options.  d) Everything is under $10 tax in/  Verdict: if you work in the area and are craving PBS or some quick, cheap Korean food, this place is a little gem in Cumberland Terrace.  PS. Terrace is misleading as it is beneath a subway."}
{"text":"I work in the Yorkville area and I find that there is not one restaurant that offers good quality wonton noodles around here. One day, I had these immense cravings for a good bowl of wonton noodles, and the closest one would have to be in Chinatown/Spadina. Are you kidding me - I have to walk/take the subway all the way to Chinatown and come back for a bowl of wonton?    So the next best thing I discovered is to order Korean dumplings ($10 tax-in) here at Metropolis Cafe in the food court. In case you're wondering, the difference between Korean dumplings and Chinese wontons is that K dumplings use beef and leek or green onions versus pork/shrimp with the occasional black fungus and bamboo shoots in wontons.    It's not the same as wonton, but it's close enough. The Korean dumplings were huge, it was a hearty bowl of dumplings and soup with a side of kimchi. The cravings were satisfied.   Someone please open a Wonton Chai or Jim Jae Kee of sorts near Yorkville or at the Cumberland Terrace food court!!!"}
{"text":"Legit Korean take out for reasonable prices! The portions are very generous and the quality is very good. Service is friendly. See what's on special each weekday. I like how the bibimbap comes with japchae noodles and lots of veggies. My DC had the beef stew -- nice on a cold day. Yes, this food court is kind dark and old school, but I appreciate that there's options like this in over-priced Yorkville."}
{"text":"It's a decent inexpensive place to go for lunch during the work day. Food quality was OK but did the trick. I'll definitely be back in the future. Try the soups! They're pretty good there and a decent amount of food for $10.00"}
{"text":"Honestly, even though the reviews here are trending down, I found the food very quick and comfort-worthy - great for a brief lunch break. Was a bit expensive for what it was but appreciated the home-made quality and generous portion size."}
