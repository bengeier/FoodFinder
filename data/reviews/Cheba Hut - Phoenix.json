{"text":"The food is really good here! Everything was hot when it came out and it all was super fresh. It's also really cool how they have kool aid on tap. I strongly recommend getting the kali mist. It's amaze balls! They also have rice krisy treats made out of fruity pebbles. You need one of those. 

The only thing I didn't like was how loud it was. I had to scream at the person who was taking my order for them to hear me. Also, they seemed a little stoned so that didn't help. Still a great place. You should check it out!"}
{"text":"Good bread and chicken on the sandwiches. Garden salad is a little boring.  The nachos are made with Doritos, which is interesting tho not my favorite.   Solid bet for a quick casual bite to eat."}
{"text":"Hit and miss. I love Cheba hut but this location has gotten my order wrong time and time again. The last time I was there I waited almost 40 minutes just to find out the food was ready 30 minutes ago. When I asked them to remake the sandwiches, I got the same cold subs back. The food is good but the service isn't worth it. I'll hike it to the Glendale location for my fix."}
{"text":"We love this place!!  We get amazing food and service every time we come!  The whole staff is great, but we love Maya.  She is always so cheerful and makes an amazing sandwich every time we come in!  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"First time eating here....and totally worthy of a 5. Friendly, welcoming and delicious. The guy at the register was kind enough to give us some direction as to what to order...and it did not disappoint!!! Settled on the 5.0 and White Widow. Fresh, toasted and full of fillings...did not feel skimped at all. And who doesnt love Kool-aid??? We will be back to enjoy the bar and more of the menu. Oh, and dont forget to get the Fruity Pebble krispies!!!! DELICIOUS...and worth the price."}
{"text":"When you call and ask a question regarding something another employee tells you and yet you get a rude person on the other end of the phone who seems to be lacking customer service skills!  Don't worry we weren't going to show up to your establishment with 2-3 people asking for free subs!  It was a question!  I will stick with Jimmy John's on Roosevelt or Ikes's Love and Sandwhiches on 4th street, where their customer service is amazing!"}
{"text":"When I came to Cheba hut the manager gave us all $5 and said \"Id rather do this than pay for advertisement.\" Super cool place, good vibes, great food!"}
{"text":"Their toasted subs are very good.  I would have given them 4 stars instead of 2, but several times they have screwed up our order resulting in us throwing our money away.  We order to go...so by the time we realize something is wrong, it is too late to do anything about it.  One time I can forgive because everyone makes mistakes, but this has become an ongoing problem.  The problem arises when you request that they NOT put something on your sandwich.  (No onions, no peppers, no whatever.)   Half the time, when you get it and unwrap it you find they ignored your request.  We have ordered on the phone.  We have ordered online...thinking if they had it all in writing it would make it easier.  It doesn't matter...it is a coin flip whether they honor your specifications or not.

So while I admit the quality is generally good, today was our last order.  When you spend $20 on takeout only to find that one of you can't eat their lunch because it includes things you can't eat...that basically removes the restaurant from your rotation.  But if you're not picky about having things the way you want, give them a try."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Came back only got a nug but is was fire everything went smooth



I love cheba hut I always go to the one on northern. Far as this one goes the guy at the register didn't know what he was doing they forgot stuff on my sandwich and they put way to much ranch on my white widow could only eat half."}
{"text":"Not sure I get the long lines and hype.  Sub was okay, but nothing to rave about and largely forgettable."}
{"text":"Such a great spot for lunch. The service was quick. The sandwich was great. Everyone I went with (4 of us) got something different and each enjoyed it. Although I haven't been to a happy hour yet, it looks like they've got a decent one. I'll definitely go back to check it out. I'd recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe and the food!!!! Wish they had one in P83 district (83rd ave and Bell) near my house it would be an amazing place to go to right after a Spring training game!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing, I loved the food. This is a very cool clean place to chill with friends. And Travis is a cool dude working the register. He is very energetic and try's to get you, your food fast."}
{"text":"So good! Great subs and salads, I've also had the munchies snacks and look-aid. Super good and they have a bar and Galaga at this location. 
Get the Jamaican Red!!"}
{"text":"Good sandwich, but how hard is it to follow online instructions? Its like they only read half my order.  A co-worker went to pick up lunch for us and they didn't include my chips or condiments.  Frustrating considering we are at work and it wasn't possible to go back and have it corrected.  


Also... it should be illegal to knowingly put brown avocado on someone's sandwich. Definitely an unpleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Always amazing!!! This place has delicious sandwiches, full of flavor and amazing fresh baked bread that melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"I really like Cheba Hut. Started going here at the Tempe location and I think I like that location better. I visit the 7th St location often, but my last experience was pretty nasty. The cashier sneezed without covering his mouth and snot went in his beard. He wiped it off with his hand and then rubbed both eyes and picked his nose a bit. Next I had to hand him my card to pay for my sandwich which at this point I was reluctant to do. I was even reluctant to eat the sandwich after I saw him head back where they were being made.  The mention of male anatomy and female dogs on the music that was playing was also inappropriate for a daytime bite to eat. Save it for the club. Still, I like Cheba Hub because this is my only bad experience in over 10 yrs. The fine art of restaurant service cleanliness seems lost and the new wave of bringing drinks by grabbing the rim with your finger tips is in!"}
{"text":"This place is great staff is friendly and helpful, food is amazing and atmosphere is down to earth ! I highly recommend Cali mist !"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place in the valley.  Their bread is just right and they have a lot of cool topping combinations.  Just expect to your sub to take a minute and you may have to fight for parking down the street."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! Try their Midewest (club) everything & extra mayo. My friend put me on to this. I think Cheba Hut and Jersey Mike's are at the top of my list"}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix, first time eating here. Got dammit they made a lasting impression on me. I had the \"White Widow\" and it was a damn good sandwich. The atmosphere is very comfortable, definitely stoner influenced. The staff is very attentive, checked on me and my Uncle to see if we were ok, did NOT over do it. Very polite. Makes you feel welcomed. Definitely recommend to anyone. This is a great restaurant"}
{"text":"Great environment, friendly staff, and creative menu options. We were just driving threw and stumbled upon the place. We were so pleasantly superiors to find delicious sammies and a full bar. Nice!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Cheba Hut!  However, I work downtown Phoenix and the one located next to me has ZERO room for parking. There's been a few times now that I've attempted to come by for lunch, and gave up and instead went back to campus for Subway. I wonder how many other people have had similar experiences with this and how much business has been lost due to this parking problem.  Such a shame."}
{"text":"The bread was super tasty and toasted. Like most sandwich places, they did not have enough toppings and the meat was limited. Overall a good sandwich but nothing amazing to me."}
{"text":"Delicious toasted subs and other goodies like rice crispy n fruity pebble treats, cookies, and now they have beer and cocktails.  Did I mention Kool-aid??? Red, blue and grape. The griefo is amazing even if you aren't a veggie-saurus.  We also had the chronic - BBQ beef sub. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Love the apollo 13 and white widow. There is always a line here at lunch but it's only because the food is amazing. Staff will remember your name and make sure they take care of you. Highly recommend this place for subs over the typical chain locations."}
{"text":"So this is the second time that I've been here and so the first time I had to try it only because I've been to other cheba huts in the past . Well the first time they screwed up my order and didn't realize it until I got home . They gave me a free meal . Thanks ! So this second time around I went in about dinner Time and there was a line and seemed pretty busy at first . After ordering my food I sat by the bar and waited patiently about 10 min . The bar tender guy Anthony was cool. So then I noticed everyone disappearing to the back aka their stock room or kitchen . Then finally after 30 min of waiting some guy comes out and asked if I was ok and I said no! My food had never been started everyone was in the back messing around and paid no attention to their little printer where ordered pop up when a guest orders food . I had ordered 3 sandwiches for my family n i . No one said sorry or anything. My point is that dont hire irresponsible people . And why isn't there manager on duty !? Soon after I get home . Guess what ? They screwed my meal up again . Fml! Smh."}
{"text":"White widow is pretty bomb!! A lot to look at when you go inside & there also is a bar which I plan on visiting next time I have more time. Cool place & theme. Super chill vibes in there"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut thank you for existing! With out you we may not have a great sandwich shop in Phoenix. I have stopped in on numerous occasions and have always been happy with the food and service. I try a different toasted sub with every stop and the flavors are always so robust and wonderful. 

Yesterday my wife and I stopped in for an early dinner. We ordered my wife's favorite the Kali Mist. It's their take on a club sandwich with roasted turkey and bacon. The chipotle mayo, fresh jalapeños, pepper jack cheese, and avocado put this beautifully built \"sammich\" over the top! Of course we always add the LTO(lettuce,tomato,onion) as well. The fresh and flavorful garlic bread is ridiculously tender. 

My new item this trip was the Hummus Platter. It featured a House and Jalapeño Hummus. Both creamy versions of this treat were fabulous. The House had subtle notes of garlic and tahini. The Jalapeño had that wonderful chili flavor without over bearing heat. Along with the platter you also receive thin slices of crisp cucumber and ripe tomato. In addition, another sliced roll of the deliciously toasted garlic bread. I really enjoyed smoothing over the tasty spread on the tender crostini and topping with slices of tomato and cucumber. I didn't miss not having meat at all. This is perfect for vegetarians or peeps looking cut back on the game. Washing all of this down with your choice of Fruit Punch, Grape or Blue Raspberry Lemonade Kool-Aid makes this \"joint\" a standout. 

I \"highly\" recommend Cheba Hut to any sandwich fan, foodie, or hungry individual I come across. In fact, you should get your mind elevated or not...and find the nearest location to indulge on one of the best sandwiches you may ever have."}
{"text":"Great food, fun people, the right attitude :)"}
{"text":"Just as you should expect of any Cheba Hut. I feel like their sandwiches are kind of dry, but the flavor is good"}
{"text":"Came here for some munchies, randomly chose to Kali Mist and it tasted delicious. oh and the rice crispy treats are"}
{"text":"Very nice staff. New location. It's the same great cheba hut but closer to work. I hope the deliver in the future. Of course there is a bar and loo laid fountain.  what more can a person want?"}
{"text":"We were excited to check out the new sandwich shop in town, but were somewhat disappointed.  The staff was welcoming and friendly, the atmosphere is fun, but the sandwiches are just ok.  We tried the smoked ham, swiss, honey mustard and pineapple on garlic herb toasted bread...it was pretty dry and nothing special.  Hopefully we just caught them on an off day!"}
{"text":"I LOVE CHEBA HUT, but I am giving this location a 3. Every single time I go there I get the same exact sub the same exact way, no jalapeños. Every time they put jalapeños on my sub here but every other location gets it right. 

Your jalapeños are amazingly fresh, I'll give you that. Any jalapeño love would be in heaven. I just can't take the heat of them and that leads me to not be able to taste my sub."}
{"text":"Heard it was exceptional, meh it was more like marginal. Got my order so wrong-it was not even close- and we only had 2 sandwiches!. I have a food allergy which I was very clear about and they doubled what I'm allergic to on the first sandwich...Wouldn't even throw in a free brownie after I had to wait for 45 extra minutes(yes for one sandwich that was so wrong they had to remake it twice and it was still wrong! I finally just said I'll take what you have made, it's closer to what I ordered than the other 2. My goodness I really wanted to like this place! Why are great sandwiches so hard to find??"}
{"text":"This was a great place to have lunch. The restaurant was very clean and the restrooms were spotless. The dining room did not have a lot of people as it was just the start of lunch. I got the Italian sandwich on garlic bread (which I recommend) and it was delicious. Very fresh veggies and plenty of meat and cheese on the sandwich. The decor of the restaurant was hipsters and included a bar with many tap beer choices. I will eat lunch here again in the near f"}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place. Very laid back 70's. Great music, our sub was really good. Plenty of room. It's an order at the register and they will then bring your food out. Have to go to the bar for your beer or drink. Prices very reasonable. $4 Grapefruit Sculpin during happy hour. Nice. Will be back. Not too packed on the Friday grand opening, but I could envision a backup at the ordering area when busy."}
{"text":"They have a lot of options and will happily customize anything for you. The wait time can get a bit long even when there's not many people in, but they always get it right so it's okay. I'll come back again the next time I'm craving a sandwich."}
{"text":"Went to the Phoenix location 2 days ago and it was EXCELLENT!   Good job people, much improved!   People were GREAT, and my sandwich, well it was perfect."}
{"text":"Bread is ok.
Veggies...claim to be fresh...hmmm on further inspection (visually and physically tasting)...no way, Jose! And I asked Jose if it was fresh...he said yes. 
Tomatoes soggy and not ripe.
Cucumber soggy. 
Lettuce wilty and not from the toasted bread. 
I also was supposed to get avocado. It was a smear but in one spot on the bread and I got the large sandwich.

It is impossible to give no stars but the reason they get one star is because biggie smalls was playing over the speaker."}
{"text":"Uniquely different

The theme at Chibahut is based on the cannibus culture. The name might attract some and put others off, but there's a couple things to know; Yes, this is a marijuana-themed restaurant, and no, they do not sell or allow you to smoke marijuana in the restaurant. The atmosphere at Chibahut is very casual and the seating is varied- tables, booths, and high top tables with stools.

ChibHut serves subs and salads on fresh baked bread that is made daily at the restaurant. Chibahut  boast about their bread and they really should because it is absolutely delicious. I enjoyed the  \"Midwest Best\", loaded with Turkey breast, smoked ham, bacon, provolone, lettuce, tomato, dressing, on a toasted Garlic Herb Bread. In addition, to salads and subs Chibahut also offers unique sweet treats, like fruit loops rice krispy treat, cookies, and brownies. I'm going to definitely try a fruit loops rice crispy treat on my next visit

The staff at Chibahut are friendly and accomdating, and were helpful when explaining the menu. Although Cheba Hut is a growing chain, it was still a refreshing break from the everyday monotony of other chain sandwich shops in the area."}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  Nice staff great prices and they even have alcohol!  Great First Friday hang out!"}
{"text":"Three stars.  The toasted subs are reliably good. If you're familiar with the other, older locations, this one lives up to Cheba Hut sandwich standards. And it seems to attract a young crowd, much like the other locations. It can get a bit warm inside in the afternoon-- the store front has a western exposure and a lot of windows, so it gets a lot of direct sunlight. Also the music can be loud enough that communication can be difficult. I prefer other locations, but if you're craving a Cheba Hut sandwich, this location is a reasonable alternative."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty! Had a late flight and starving afterwards. They were still open and decided to try it! So hard to find decent late night food. I ordered a turkey sandwich with extra jalapeños ...beware they are REAL jalapeños! Not jarred! But still great sandwich. Also awesome service! I got there at 11:50, ten minutes before closing at midnight, and they were still super nice, not annoyed that I came in late and the guy at the cash wrap was okay with my multiple questions since it was my first time!"}
{"text":"The food is great always but your bartender has a serious attitude problem. The blonde girl. I was in the other day, it wasn't even busy and she just had an absolutely ridiculous attitude. All we asked was what drinks you guys had and she rolls her eyes and is rushing us to get out of her face \"what do you want?\" No hello or anything so we ask what's available \"Um ok? What do you like...\" we tell her beer. \"Ok.. (rolls her eyes again) I'm asking like what kind coors, blue moon , what?\" Just such shit attitude. Calm down get a job you enjoy. Just SO RUDE! Didn't even want another drink after that."}
{"text":"I have been going to Cheba Hut for years and it's by far the best sub place ever!! I've only ever ordered the white widow, because it's that amazing.. but I know everything here is great! Don't forget the Kool-aid, and yummy cereal treats!!"}
{"text":"Well, you wont walk out of this place high, but probably a few pounds heavier. Lol. Their white widow is AMAZING. I have not been to Cheba Hut in probably 10 years, partially because I forgot about them (I live downtown where up until now they had none in Phoenix). I'm not exactly sure for being around 18 years, why it took so long to have a Phoenix location, but I must say, it was worth the wait! Very good food. I like the 3 different size options. Happy hour daily. I think the whole pot theme is a bit overdone (for someone who doesn't smoke). But I guess that's the whole thing that sets this place apart. You step inside a trippy well decorated building. Luckily, my 7 year old only chose to point out the slug bugs all over the place, and not anything else! Will definitely be back, and probably put on all the 10 pounds ive lost over the summer!"}
{"text":"Eeeekkkk I'm a new fan of Cheba Hut Downtown!

CHEBA HUT

Cheba Hut is a \"roasted\" sub concept that started in 1998.

Founder Scott Jennings decided to showcase the harmony between great tasting food and a very specific \"counter-culture.\"

Their claim to fame is \"the best bread in the business\" and nothing fried.

The Cheba Hut motto:

\"Where the only thing fried is an occasional customer.\"

Cheba Hut has locations in Arizona, Colorado, California, Oregon, New Mexico, and Wisconsin. 

THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

I was on my way home from work and I thought I'd try out Cheba Hut.

I was hoping for breakfast, and I can't remember the last time I even had a sub sandwich and my expectations were low.

So I sat at the bar, and asked the bartender, James, what's good. James recommended some raspberry cider and the GRIEFO with bacon and turkey.

The GRIEFO, which is a cream cheese, guacamole, veggie sub, which I added bacon and turkey, was OUTRAGEOUSLY SCRUMPTIOUS! I ordered the 4\" and wished I had ordered the 8\" after I gobbled the whole thing down.

I tried another recommendation from James, called \"Other Half Gin Barrel Aged Headin' West Arizona Wilderness,\" which was also very good. 

I'm impressed, James knows his stuff.

The place was causal and had a lot of city employees there for lunch.

James told me that the place has a big crowd most nights. They're usually opened until 12am, and Fri/Sat until 2am.

I had James make me a fresh lime juice kamikaze, and we discussed the history of Chaba's and his cool 60's punk band, The Freaks of Nature, upcoming Europe Tour.

I even tried their homemade Rice Krispie & Blueberry Crunch Bars which I loved.

CONCLUSION 

Very casual. Good food. Cool place. Cool staff.

4/5 RECOMMEND

*Plenty of parking out front.

{"text":"love this place. the bartender/waiteress was a total bitch in the best way!!! food was so damn good. beer was so damn good. 2$ soco shots were perfect. thank you arely!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Keep in mains parking can be difficult at this location so call ahead ."}
{"text":"Phoned an order in, 4 sandwiches, and a couple of desserts...15-20 minutes later, we were picking up our meal and enjoying the best sandwiches downtown has to offer!! Order was right, customer service was on point, and prices are reasonable. Some places think downtown location warrants high prices. Not Cheba Hut. They stay true to their Tempe roots and didn't disappoint! We will be loyal and frequent customers!"}
{"text":"Was getting my muffler fixed at the shop accross the street and needing a couple hours to kill; I decided to grab some lunch. 

Lucky for me I noticed the vibrant colored van outside and while admiring the vehicle i caught myself tapping along to the music. How couldn't I give this place a shot? Walked in and greeted by a friendly staff who were helpful in explaining their menu. I think they offer awesome choices and i settled on the white widow sandwich (chicken, bacon ranch sub), chips and a drink. Took my seat and admired the beverage selection while i waited for my order to be ready. I sat down and paged through the local events paper and enjoyed the atmosphere. What else could you ask for? Oh yeah, the subs are delicious! Overall will return and recommend. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing food ! Only thing that I did not like so much was the menu placement . Almost drop my neck man lol other than that amazing !!! The kool-aid is badass!"}
{"text":"Full bar in a sandwich shop? Yep!
Tons of pro pot stuff on the walls? Yep!
There ya' go, I'm already sold. 
And then my sandwich was good and pretzel bits even better. Unlike a previous reviewer, my customer service was spot on and solid. I love it. Big ups!"}
{"text":"Convienent location to downtown.  When they say best bread?  Ya...bread was amazing.  The 12 inch sandwiches are enough for two.  Went with the t-Rex and it was very good.  Chocolate chip cookie?  Oh ya...loved that too!  Very laid back atmosphere inside and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Sandwich review only; I know Cheba can n has done better n the staff is always friendly .. With that said the AK-47 (French dip) needs help. If it wasn't for the au jus I may have tossed it out the window onto 7th street .. The bread was dry, the provolone was absent, the portobellos were raw n over powered the meat. It's a toasted sandwich but was cold in the middle; I cld only put up w half of the sandwich. Better off drinking the au jus n eatn the sun chips."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Cheba Hut and used to frequent their Tempe location when I lived nearby, so I was super excited when they opened the Downtown Phoenix spot. I ordered two sub sandwiches a couple weeks back and upon arriving home noticed they were each missing a couple key ingredients. A quick call to the store and they apologized and let us know a new team member had started and was still learning the recipes. I can understand (who hasn't been the new guy at some point?) They were more than happy to offer a free sandwich on my next visit. My next visit was today. I called and ordered two more subs to-go, they assured me they had my free sub accounted for. When I showed up to pay- I was shocked! They gave us BOTH sandwiches completely FREE! While I was only expecting one to be comped, they hooked it up and gave us the whole order free. It was so delicious and the sandwiches made perfect. What a refreshingly friendly place. \"Highly\" recommend :)"}
{"text":"This place is still around? Is what I thought when I drove by the 7th street location. I can remember back in the 1900's heading over to mesa to hit up this tasty sandwich shop. We were so cool. 

I love the sandwiches here. The turkey, the Italian, etc. what I'm saying is I've not had a bad sandwich here. I even keep a menu at home so I can decide before I go. That's dedication!  

The brownies, gooey balls are good for the sweet tooth. Try them. 

Love the whole word play with weed culture (that's what made me so cool in the 1900's).  Very creative. 

Highly (ha ha) suggest you try this place."}
{"text":"Something I have learned is to never under estimate the culinary creativity of a stoner. Someone with the munchies and a unique pallet can often imagine the most ridiculous flavor combinations and make them work. Cheba Hut is a cannabis culture-themed eatery that is the perfect example that proves this theory correct. I have never had a disappointing sandwich from Cheba Hut. If you are turned off by the marijuana theme, my only advise to get over it or miss out on the most terrific toasted sub in Downtown Phoenix.

In addition to the food being good, there are two more great features in Cheba Hut's favor that makes it stand out from many other places in the downtown area. It's open late (midnight) and has online ordering. I'm a late night worker with few options other than drive-thrus, which makes Cheba Hut an extra special treat. I typically order my food around 9:45pm and pick it up around 10:15pm, and it's always ready and delicious. It looks like many other late night eaters agree with me, because Cheba Hut is always occupied with a good amount of diners and/or drinkers at the bar in the back corner at this time.

The only negative is addressed in some other reviews. The parking. Cheba Hut is a stone-throw away from most of downtown (7th st. just south of Roosevelt), meaning driving will be a necessity for most people. The lot is small and the parking off to the side is limited. But isn't that the case for just about everything in this part of town?"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place hundreds of times and finally decided to try it out. While the atmosphere isn't my style the food IS! It's delicious. You can taste the freshness and quality ingredients. The staff is always fast and friendly which is great to find nowadays! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sandwich in the world. White widow with jalapeño cream cheese and hot sauce on the side. You won't be disappointed.  Bloody Mary's are equally as awesome!  Check it out. Nothing less than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Fresh ingredients and very friendly staff.  Only issue was not enough parking on the street."}
{"text":"Amazing toasted subs. This particular location has a secret stash sub called the \"Trex\" meat and more meat... oh and bacon. Mmmmm. Decor and theme is fun. Wait time can be a little long but the food is very much worth the wait. This particular location has free parking which is great for downtown phoenix but parking is limited. Their goodies are fantastic. Definitely recommend the goo ball and fruity pebbles rice krispy treat."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice addition to the neighborhood. Food is always consistent. This location has a full bar with excellent daily drink specials. Bartender James was very friendly and knowledgeable on all of the tap beers and cocktails. Only points to take off would be the music selection, it seems to always be the same songs and artists every time I visit."}
{"text":"My go-to sandwich is the Griefo, but I sub the house dressing for their chipotle sauce. It always hits the spot! The sandwiches are a little on the pricier side, so I usually get the blunt size and make 2 meals out of it. Just a heads up, the sandwiches can take a few minutes to make, but it allows time for you to enjoy the unique ambience of the place! For the convenience of location, I will definitely be returning again!"}
{"text":"I have never eaten here before today and decided to give it a try. I ordered from door dash and had it delivered to my work. I tried the Kali Mist and all I can say is WOW and couldn't be happier with the choice I made. Absoutely great food. I will definitely be back to try the other delicious sandwiches I saw on the menu!!"}
{"text":"As usual, cheba hut did not disappoint, huge sub, tons if fillings. Everything is always fresh in their subs. When I was there last night they had some good entertainment with some local rappers. Probably wouldn't wear a MAGA hat here, might get spit in your sub

I got the power green sub with added chicken. Little expensive at 15 bucks but you get a lot of food"}
{"text":"Awesome place even better food and staff definitely a spot I will come to every time im in AZ"}
{"text":"Amazingly good subs, ( I had the kind, 8 inch), super friendly and fun staff! THIS is how you run an outstanding business!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Welcome Cheba Hut to downtown, long waited but worth your time stroll in for a nug, and even a pint of beer of pint! Happy hour from 4:20 to 7:20 get your dollar off beer, they also have a full out bar in the seating area. Extended lounging and dining room in the patio area as well. Cheba Hut brings an hippie nostalgia feeling when walking in, high vibes and always positive of course. Sandwiches are themed from marijuana theme, no drugs in their food of course. If that was the case everyone would be happy! But they have a wide selection of veggies and meat sandwiches. Vegetations are welcome here! Love all the choices all delicious, don't really have a favorite favorite but the staff has a feel for their own food! So if you're in downtown and want to have a high happy time with your food and drinks come through to Cheba Hut! Stay hungry and happy Phoenix ."}
{"text":"This is way cooler than the Cheba Hut I used to frequent! Same stoner-themed sandwiches everyone loves, but with the addition of a bar in the corner. 

Things I like: As usual, the sandwiches are great. I'm no vegetarian, but the Magic Mushroom is one of the best! I love that they *try* to do a little bit of nightlife with an open mic, and staying open til midnight makes this a great place to have a light meal and pregame. Did I mention the fountain drinks are amazing?

Things I don't like: The bar looks...rickety. Bare bones, like someone nailed a bunch of particle board together. But it's better than nothing! I also dislike the ordering experience. Like...normally at a sandwich place you start with the sandwich as described on the menu and select what you want to add. Why did they get rid of that? Like, the sandwich by default comes with *every topping available* and the person taking your order blurts out, with auctioneer-like speed, \"would you like picklesonionsoliveslettuceetc on that?\" I didn't hear \"olives\" and ended up with olives in a place they should not be. Fuck that, sir. 

And why do you ask me if I want ranch? This is a gosh darn terriyaki flavored sandwich already? Who in their right mind is asking for that? And before you say \"stoners\", only people who don't toke think stoners make uniquely poor culinary decisions. I'm getting frustrated once more just thinking about it. 

But, whatever. Rant over. You should go here because it's plenty awesome regardless."}
{"text":"A delicious sandwich.  Perfectly toasted.  Good drink options lol if you are a kid ( kool aid ) and soda options. 
Lots of munchie and snack options.

Not a healthy meal option..  music is a bit loud to try having a quiet conversation. 

I will come back again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for quick work lunches. I usually get The Kind, which is pretty much turkey with bacon. For a quick sandwich fix at work, I think these have been great! I haven't tried much of the rest of the menu.

There's a decent amount of seating inside. However, parking might get difficult on rush hours. There are a few parking spots on the side of the building."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up an Alcapulco gold sub, blunt sized, no onions for the love of my life and some blue kool-aid. Total was $13.26. Seeing my boyfriend, priceless. 

First off, parking is kinda limited. For me at least because I suck at parallel parking. #asianproblems but I managed to find a spot within a couple seconds.

Second, I've been to many Cheba huts in Arizona. Tempe, Mesa, Glendale and I'm so freakin' flabbergasted at how big this location is! 

Third, the staff immediately greeted me right when I walked in and they have a cool little game arcade machine here! 

Fourth, I did have a bite of my boyfriends sandwich and I'm not sure why but i swear they put unicorn dust in it because it was so good.

I have to come back and dine here!"}
{"text":"Okay so this place is awesome! If you haven't been here, your missing out on a great sandwich. I got the 5-0
As in slang for cop or in this case ...some good bread fill with pork! Clever and quality meat. Seriously good vibe in the joint. Everyone was friendly and helpful. My buddy got a meatball pinner and ate the entire thing without out taking a breath.
Come here to eat. No joke"}
{"text":"They are on point when they get the order right! But I have been going since they had the first one in Tempe durning my College day that won't stop me from going!!!!"}
{"text":"Straight amazing but a bit pricey. Funny names, would probably make more sense if I was a stoner. Food's pretty on point though. 

Stay away from the chicken sandos. Pretty low quality, seemingly frozen, chicken strips."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite lunch spots!  We stop by almost every time we are in Phoenix.  We get great service from everyone, but Maya has always been awesome when we come in!  Keep Up the great work."}
{"text":"I love Cheba Hut but the parking at this one is horrendous. Seriously the worst. I've attempted to eat here multiple times and had to turn around to go home because I could not park. It's ridiculous. And today there was an event that took up one of the 2 places to park. Are you kidding me?! Are you trying to lose business?! 2 stars for the food because it's great. -3 stars for not only the crappy parking but because it's dangerous to even turn back around to drive home. 

I'm updating my review as I got a response from them. 
I love this location because it is so close to my home. Maybe two stars is a little harsh. The parking is still crappy but when I can make it, I love the food. And those treats! Mmmmm! I had a cycle CTC cinnamon apple one and it was amazing! I'll knock one star off for the parking."}
{"text":"I was pretty skeptical about this place because I normally get my sub sandwiches else where. So, my roommate decided to treat me to this location and I can say I was totally wrong.

As you walk-in your greeted right away by a friendly staff. I also notice that there were a lot of interesting stickers and art surrounding the area. There's also a awesome arcade game with over 250 games or more. A koolaid machine serving three flavors! Last but not least this location has a bar! There specialty drinks sound amazing and didn't have the privilege to try any of them. 

Now the sandwiches were amazing! I had the dank sandwich which is pretty much a \"pizza sub\". I
Loaded the dank up with pretty much everything you would see on a deluxe pizza. Lol. The bread was toasted to perfection and went well with the sub. It really did taste like a pizza just in a compacted sub. I will definitely be back at this place to try other subs and their drinks. 

Highly recommend this place for sandwich lovers."}
{"text":"I've been getting the White Widow sub for years. I think this sandwich place is under estimated due to their choice of theme/decor. They make great quality sandwiches and deserve a lot more credit. 

I usually get the white widow, which is basically a bacon chicken ranch sub. I get it without the mushrooms and get all the fixings on it. Their homemade ranch is sooooo good. 

Don't expect super quick service. They even have a sign that mentions \"quality takes time\". This location doesn't have that many parking spaces, so you may need to parallel park."}
{"text":"I love this place so hard ! Came for the grand opening and had so much fun!!! Butter sculpture competition, raffles and great sandwiches and great beer selection! We will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a place my boyfriend and I like to frequent! Love the chill vibe and the sandwiches are AMAZING!! We have introduced this place to some friends and family and they all loved it! The location is great, right in the heart of downtown Phoenix and literally right off the freeway so it's very convenient."}
{"text":"Picked up some sandwiches to go... 

Ordered California Club.
Was out of jalapeños so they offered to sub peppercini 
No mayo, I hate mayo. 

I get home zero peppercini and lots of mayo and NO avocado.
You just ruined my whole day sandwich maker! Thankfully I had some avocados and jalapeño at home and the mayo was a decent aioli that wasn't too painful to eat

So my sandwich ended up being pretty amazing. Now, I highly doubt they'd actually put a whole avocado on a sandwich (but they really should)

Flavor of bread was really good... honestly I should probably order it again to give a truly honest review of their product.... but it was good, I'm happy. Will be back."}
{"text":"Love that we have a Cheeba Hut in the hood!! Very friendly customer service and both times I've been my sandwich was just as expected!!  I've been frequenting the Mesa location for over a decade so it's nice to have one so close to home.  Good selection of craft beers at the bar, looks like Friday is all day happy hour at $3 a glass for craft, not to bad at all.  Don't forget to try the munchies!! I tried the Cap'n Crunch bar, wowsers! Can't wait to come back to get a Blunt of Chronic :-)


Edit 6/14/17
Tried to call in a take out order like I've done over a dozen times at 11:30 and was told \"no take out orders after 11:30\"  I live in the neighborhood and usually order on the phone and pick it up in 10 minutes later.  Pretty lame, no more Cheeba Hut ever again for late night eats, Welcome Diner it is."}
{"text":"Great bar, great food, and very super friendly staff and bartenders! Will definitely keep going there."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut is.... interesting.... They have a million different types of sandwiches that all have clever names. The sandwiches are super affordable and filling. The actual quality of the sandwich is decent. The last time I tried a special Caesar salad themed sandwich that tasted.... ok. They also have crazy nachos that are made with cheesy Doritos....they taste super processed buuuuuut still kinda good. Anyway, Though their sandwiches aren't amazing, I would rather get Cheba Hut than Subway or Potbelly any day."}
{"text":"Awesome place and haha I love the weed theme!
I'm in town for a week and happened to stay at the Holiday Inn down the road. This place was close by and open late. I had no idea what to expect but loved it as soon as I walked in. Super chill vibes and awesome artwork on the walls. 
Starving after the flight I ordered a \"blunt\" power plant. Which was dope! And a side of Not'chos for my munchies. Which was also amazing. 
Definitely gonna be back one of the nights later this week!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received!!!! Slowest 10 workers to make one salad, and no orders came out before mine, waited 25mins!"}
{"text":"My go-to sandwich is the Green Crack.  You'll thank me later if you decide to order that...you can't go wrong with roast beef, cream cheese, and jalapeño after a nice \"toasty\" day.  also make sure you drink the Kool Aid too!"}
{"text":"Best toasted sandwich in the valley.  I prefer the Midwesr Best which is aiken to a club sandwich.  The  tuna is great too.  My husband aleays gets the White Widow, chicken. I would skip the Meatball, though I generally love meatball sandwiches, the one here is so so. 


There is a full bar as well.  If you want something a little sweet they have a toasted PB and J which you can get in a 4 inch to satisfy your sweet tooth.....if of course the Kool Aide on tap or rice crispy treats dont do it for you."}
{"text":"I love Cheba Hut and this is the 3rd location I've been to. I decided to show my boo the place and he was not disappointed, absolutely loves the place and he tells everyone who will listen about it! I highly recommend the White Widow it is my go to sandwich always Blunt sized."}
{"text":"Not impressed. They messed up my order and the staff making the sandwiches seemed less than enthusiastic about their job...makes me super skeptical about how much care is being put into the food being served overall. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for work and stopped in to grab a sandwich. The whole vibe is chill and casual. Music is playing so not ideal to take a call, but remember you're there for food! I have two young kids and would take them here. However, if you're uptight regarding a hemp setting, this may not be the place to bring your kids.

I ordered the meatball, aka \"The Bomb\" and it was the bomb. Not the typical meatball, sauce, cheese, & bread in their sub. It came with the above along with mushrooms and bell peppers. Whoa!? What a great idea! It was pretty outstanding. The bread was toasted, nice touch. 

I went with medium or \"Pinner\" haha, with a drink. Came to $10. Not bad for what I received.

Definitely going back to try something else while I'm in town. I'm also going to grab the old school Kool Aid that they serve too!"}
{"text":"We had an Apollo 13 & it was delicious. Love the tips they add on the menu with each item; the banana peppers were the perfect touch. The decor was quirky and interesting, \"ethnic\" without crossing over into offensive territory, which is hard to do. The only thing that was missing from the atmosphere was the #NicKnSix experience."}
{"text":"Had their Loaded Not'chos, Fire Bread and a salad. Their Fire Bread is awesome!!!! Everything was really tasty will definitely be revisiting when in the area!"}
{"text":"Cheba hut has the best sandwiches in town! Their bread so toasty and tasty. My favorite sandwich to get from here is the white widow. They have so many sandwiches you can eat from I wish I could just try them all. They also have some delicious cereal treats and KOOL AID to drink from."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut is a solid choice for a sandwich with a stoner vibe. They're always promoting new specials and some sandwiches may vary by the location. 3 flavors Kool-aid on tap, great bread, fun staff and great food. The only knock is that they occasionally miss when you ask for something to be added or removed from your order. They'll gladly take care of it however."}
