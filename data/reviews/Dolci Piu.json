{"text":"I ordered a personalized caked just 4 days before the scheduled event, and Dolci Piu delivered!! Not only was the design EXACTLY like I wanted it to be, but the cake was also delicious! It only lasted about 15 minutes on the diner table and was the talk of the night. I was very impressed and satisfied by the service, will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Just came out of this place. Took a lobstertail at $7.00. It was the worse I've  had in my life. Being italian, i can tell the difference when fresh or not, It must of been 3 days old. I can reassure you, they are aware of it. They offered me something in return, i prefered not to. If your going to sale old pastries at full price, only shows your cheating your customers who are ignorant of quality."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries, viennoiseries and cakes. Coffee is great and lunch menu (hearty sandwiches, salads, quiches, tarts and pot pies) is delicious. Portions are quite large and the prices are fair.   Layout of the pastry/chocolate counter offers great eye candy.  Service is friendly and fast as they have many employees serving.   You can enjoy your tasty treat inside or outside on a small terrace.   This is one of the rare places on that part of Decarie that serves high quality food and still remains unpretentious."}
{"text":"I ordered my wedding cake from Dolci Piu.  It was simply gorgeous and I cannot even count how many compliments we got from our guests on the beautiful cake!  I know, I know, you must be wondering what it tasted like.  It was delicious!  We ordered different layers and each tasted fresh and pleased the palates of my picky guests.    We also ordered a selection of mini pastries which were enjoyed by our guests.  The only unfortunate situation was that my husband and I were too busy that night to enjoy the pastries!    In addition, we ordered a tiramisu birthday cake and it was devoured in no time.  Overall, if I were to ever get married again (to my current husband of course... I'm thinking a vow-renewal), I'd do it all over with Dolci Piu.    If you're planning an event and would like to order cakes/pastries from Dolci Piu, I highly recommend booking an appointment.  This place gets busy and you can't just walk in and expect an appointment!  The store owner is friendly and offers good suggestions, so it's worth the wait... just book in advance!"}
{"text":"I'm so lucky that this amazing Italian patisserie is so close to my home...I love their cannoli, pastries, cakes and viennoiseries...everything is so fresh and delicious, love their coffee too"}
{"text":"I first walked in this shop because of a tasting session for wedding cake. Got referred by my coworker. The attendant served a variety of flavoured sponge cakes including vanilla, chocolate, velvet, and lemon. Very delicious and with a fluffy texture, not too sweet. In the shop, besides daily bakery and pastries, they also serve snacks, sandwiches, daily soup, and a section of frozen meals, quiches, pies, cold cuts and homemade spaghetti sauce. It's an italian version of ?La Premiere Moisson? or ?Le Gascogne?but more of a private owned, less commercial type."}
{"text":"Alright, this is my first 5 star review.  I thought about this moment long time ago, what kind of place that would actually deserve a 5 star from a picky person like me.  However, there is really nothing to talk about here, they deserve all the praises from the Yelpers.  I do not know how the macarons and the pizza taste, I had ice cream here about 5 years ago and it tasted wonderful. I can only assume their desserts and freshly baked pizza to be of higher standards.  I ordered a birthday cake here for my girlfriend, and I had the chance to talk to the owner Patrizia about the design. At first I thought it was very pricey for a customized cake, but when I actually saw the final product today I was completely blown away. The minute attention to the drawings, to the texture of colour and the expression of the character, it was more of an art piece than a simple anniversary cake.  The flavour of the cake was fantastic, not too sweet, and had just the right amount of berries in it to compliment the creamy fillings.  Simply amazing."}
{"text":"I've known the owner, Robert Marano, since he was working with his sisters in Boulangerie Luigi's (Luigi's Bakery) here in LaSalle before setting up shop in Ville St. Laurent.  Walk in to a nice, well-decorated, spacious interior with a casual atmosphere great for enjoying a meal in a relaxing environment.  Great selection of chocolates, cakes and pastries. I definitely recommend their home-made gelato (Italian ice cream).  They've got free WiFi, too.  Did I mention that Robert and his wife Patty appeared on Slice Network's reality TV show \"Cake Walk\" (Season 1 Episode 1)? Guess who won first prize?  http://www.slice.ca/cake-walk/video/full-episodes/punk-rock-love/video.html?v=99088451846#cake-walk/video/full-episodes"}
{"text":"I get dizzy and overwhelmed at this place because there is SO many things to buy and eat!! I come here on almost a weekly basis and what I recommend is the chocolate croissants, their cakes, and vegetarian sandwiches! I recently ordered a vanilla, raspberry & strawberry, coconut 7 inch meringue cake for my boyfriend's birthday....not only did it look so beautiful to the eyes but it was YUMMY! Not too sweet and not too bitter...it had just a right taste to it, right blend and combination of cream and vanilla etc. Everyone liked the cake. Their choco croissants are the same....not too sweet like a lot of cafes make it. Their vegetarian sandwiches grilled? AMAZING.  They have grilled/roasted veggies with an option of cheese, really tasty. I would not buy their macarons though...it wasn't the right texture or maybe they had an off day. They have other options such as quiches, soups, gelato,pastries/muffins etc. Like I said....so many things to try and buy!  Anyway, worth checking out this bakery if you guys are in the St. Laurent neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place to pick up a box of pastries to bring with me when invited to dinners. They make amazing cakes for weddings and birthday parties, albeit a little pricey. It's a great place to have lunch and has a little terrace in the summer.  If you have a craving for a pastry, great quiches and sandwiches, or even great coffee, you have to check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new coffee/pastry shop to try and hang nearby. Lovely place to hang out during the day with friends. They have a big selection of pastries. My mouth was watering just by looking at them. We only had hot drinks but I must say that i definitely will come back because they seem to make beautiful cakes for all kind of events."}
{"text":"Do yourselves a favour and try their pastries! I went to charitable event last year where they served pastries from Dolci Piu, including an Italian dessert called Lobster Tails. If you've never tried one, you must! Delicious outside - kind of like a croissant shell stuffed with pastry cream. YUM. Got to try the chocolate and regular vanilla flavour. I've tried the mini size and the large. All good! Too bad it's so far from me...."}
{"text":"Loved the staff. Very friendly and efficient. The amaretti is finger-licking good. Wonderful place!!"}
{"text":"Discovered this gem thanks to fellow yelpers.  Had a wide selection of pastries, cafe food and sweet treats.    There's even a selection of nicely packaged goodies for gifts.   The ladies there were so sweet and helpful.  Would've loved to try their savory foods, looked scrumptious.    Loved this place so much that returned later in the same day to get more pastries for an afternoon meeting"}
{"text":"Amazing pastries, sandwiches, desserts and coffee!  I've gone here a couple of times for lunch and ordered cakes for special events. I have always been impressed!  Great spot!"}
{"text":"5 stars. 5 stars. 5 stars.  You walk in and you get a great selection of Pastries that will simply cheer up your day (and make you poor!). Did I mention I got dizzy at all the pretty things I wanted to eat?  Needed to buy 2 cakes since we were double booked that day. They were great and complete hits.  Service was quick and efficient and they made a cute \"Happy 1 Month!\" sign for me without even asking after I was chatting it up that I was visiting friends on their son's first month birthday.  Price tag is a bit steep but it is worth every single penny.  They do far more than cake and pastries as well."}
{"text":"They have the best cannolis!!  Never been disappointed!! They make them fresh, on the spot. Beautiful cannoli and filling!! I've had many cupcakes which are really good. There's a generous amount of frosting but not enough lol they have lunch option as well but never tried anything along with other dessert options."}
{"text":"So..today was my first time visiting this place. There were so many pastries and I came here specifically for the cannolis. I have been craving them for the past 2 weeks and I finally found a good place close to home!  You see guys, I had high expectations for this cannoli adventure. The creamy filling was rich and slightly sweet. The crust was okay and I would have liked it to be fresher. But, it was quite crunchy. I have definitely had better cannolis! I would rate it 7.5/10. The coffee was just okay and I am looking forward to trying other pastries. The place is super tiny and the seatings are not that comfortable. They had good customer service and the place was quite packed at lunch hour.  So, I think this place is definitely worth a try :)"}
{"text":"Not to bad place to pick up a quick bite It's a small place mostly has pastries. Coffee is great, pizza not do bad.   Could use more staff"}
{"text":"I didn't get to go to the patisserie myself, but my husband went to get a cake for his sister's birthday and he brought home a mini cannoli to try. It was delicious and filled with fresh creamy filling. My husband thought it was the best cannoli he's ever had. He's not Italian, but has had a fair share of cannolis. He said the cannoli was made to order so it was really fresh. The cake was just made too.  Can't wait to try this beautiful cake, which my husband grabbed before they put it on display  Should have taken a picture of the cannoli. We will surely be back and try other goodies."}
{"text":"No WIFI ... what the hell guys! Coffee is good, sandwich also, but seriously providing wifi to your clients is a bare minimum when you have tables so that people can sit around. I'll read the free journal .... OH WAIT!!!! There isn't any.  Wise up!  The staff working behind the counter is amazing."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place should be closed down. It's clearly going to lead to nothing but obesity and diabetes because it's nearly impossible to avoid stopping here after you have been once!   First, the people...so incredibly friendly, helpful, and ready to point out their favorite things if it's your first time or you want to try something different. Everything is delicious, rich, but not too sweet. Absolutely delectable.   It's a bit expensive, as you would expect, but...come on, it's worth it once in a while, and it certainly feels like you get your moneys worth!"}
{"text":"Really good baguette that's baked fresh every morning! I wish I could say the same about their espresso and cappuccino, as well as their croissants, but I can't. All three were very lackluster. The coffees just weren't up to par and the croissant was not flaky and buttery like it's supposed to be.  However, this is a great place to go in the morning to sit outside and people watch."}
{"text":"Great selection of sandwiches and desserts. We have ordered several cakes for wedding, baptism, birthday and been very satisfied with the quality and taste!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live in the area and we go to pick up croissants at least twice a week, they are so good!!!!! During summer we go for lunch sometimes. It's very pleasant to sit outside and enjoy its coffee. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Little place with so many sweets baked goods and coffee.  Staff working who serviced me were very friendly and she was helpful when it came to picking sweets since some of them I didnt know what they were but looked amazing.  Every bite was so good and sweet  hard to find a place like this in the states.  I would give an both arms and legs to pack them up and relocate em to Florida if that was possible lol."}
