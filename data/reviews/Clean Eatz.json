{"text":"Great food and customer service.  The fruit infused waters and lemonades are a great idea."}
{"text":"I ordered my first few meals from them this week, and I have to say; everything has been wonderful. I am not particularly a fan of healthy eating, but the meals I have ordered so far just taste like great food. I work over 40 hours a week and finding time to do my own meal prep just wasn't happening for me, Clean Eatz has been a life saver. I come home, throw it in the microwave and in a few minutes I have an amazing, tasty, well balanced dinner. No drive thrus, no stress about what I'm making for dinner. The hardest part is picking which meal I want to try next. I will be ordering again next week, and the week after that. If you are looking to eat better, or simply tired of grabbing a bad option because it's all you have time for, or if you simply love great food, give clean eatz a try. You will be so happy that you did."}
{"text":"I eat here frequently as I am trying to be more health conscious.  The food is decent for healthy.  The atmosphere is dry.  Aluminum chairs and the TV blaring.  But the counter is always busy.  Prices are moderate.  I do wish they would add a few more options to the dining menu.  I tend to go for the chicken bacon ranch flat bread, side salad.  Hubby loves the Arnold.  Very filling and full of protein for an intense work out."}
{"text":"Great experience. I am glad that there is a place with healthy food near my job. I look forward to having one of these locations near my home."}
{"text":"This place is great! You have to try their bowls or the hot wing wrap- AMAZING! I also appreciate the family friendly environment they have created including Christian music. I made the mistake of only getting food at the restaurant for a couple of weeks, but their grab and go meal plans are just as good as the food in the restaurant. Budget wise it's cheaper than going grocery shopping, you don't have to cook it (warm it up in microwave or toaster oven), and every meal has been fantastic. I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Although just opened, this place seems to know exactly what I needed relative to healthy eating. I was able to get tasty food that catered to my dietary needs, and my husband was also able to get a hearty sandwich he enjoyed. I would certainly recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time. She got the Build Your Own Bowl with quinoa, salmon, veggies, and teriyaki sauce. It was awesome. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented everything well.  Me, being a steak and potatoes kinda guy ordered the Thai wrap. I was very pleasantly surprised. It had a nice kick to it but wasn't overpowering, exactly what you'd expect from something with Thai in the title. For someone who doesn't willingly eat healthy too often, I would definitely come back again. The food is delicious and you hardly even realize the lower calorie count."}
{"text":"This is my first time here.  I was apprehensive as usual when trying a place for the first time.  I ordered turkey burger with a salad for $8+.  Half of my salad is what you see in the pics, old and bad mixed in with the good.  Although I ate the burger the experience with the salad made me wonder what about my burger or anything else was not fresh.  I did get two $3 off cards for next time from the guy who took my order.  Honestly, not sure if I'll come back or use the cards."}
{"text":"The guy at the front counter is very nice and helpful! The accuracy of the kitchen leaves something to be desired. If it weren't for the nice guy at the front advocating for my meal to be correct, it was,or would have been, wrong on 4/4 of my last visits. So, 100% of my last 4 visits came up inconsistent. It's a good place and I'll continue to go if they can work out the issues in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Bad food, terrible loud music, uncomfortable tables, disengaged staff.  Tried this place after work.  Concept is good, healthy food next to a popular gym.  Results were horrible.  Chopped chicken was extremely dry with bone pieces throughout.  Sauces were lame.  Music so loud and annoying, made you want out as fast as possible.  I saw they were out of forks and told an employee, he said \"sorry dude, they're all dirty\" and never brought more (I used a spoon).  Tables are cheap, thin aluminum ones that scoot every time you touch them.  Place reminds you of a class project gone wrong."}
{"text":"I liked this place!   I love the concept. It's clean food at reasonable prices.   The menu is simple and refreshing. They offer sandwiches,snacks, wraps, flatbreads, and even burgers! But that's not all they also have a Meal Plan option available. Basically, they email you the menu and you chose what you want for the week. Just submit your order by Sunday night and pick it up on Monday.Not to mention they are freshly prepared AND perfectly portioned meals. I'm in.   I plan to place an order soon so I'll probably do an update on my thoughts after that.   But yesterday, I stopped in for lunch and ordered the Thai Wrap. You get a choice of three sides either a side salad (with low fat dressing), yogurt parfait or fresh veggies. I chose the side salad.   By the time I remembered to take the picture, most of my food was gone. So I obviously enjoyed it! But I did manage to get a great shot of goodies and fresh veggies. The Thai wrap comes with chicken, cabbage, carrots, edamame and spinach with a Thai peanut sauce. I really enjoyed it! It was super filing and I didn't have to feel bad about making an unhealthy choice!   Overall, I'm excited this place is around to give me an alternative choice for lunch.   I'm looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for lunch, he got a Skinny Burger and I ate the Buffalo chicken wrap. This was our first time and let me tell you we will be back, many more times. We are on weight watchers and it's so hard to find a Friday lunch spot where we can treat ourselves without eating like crap.  I wish there was another shop open close to Fort Mill :) Hint Hint"}
{"text":"First time here--OUTSTANDING! Ahi tuna bowl w/quinoa, black beans, broccoli & snow peas & a salmon bowl w/quinoa & brown rice combo, plus veggies.  Excellent portions & food was delicious!  Great service as well--very friendly.  Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I dropped in while in the area for professional development. I wish they were located closer to where I live. They offer meal plans. I guess you can order and they will have your meals ready to pick up, or you can go in and they have huge industrial refrigerators where you can select your own meals to take home. This place is ideal for anyone who needs help with meal planning for fitness. I am going to look into pricing and see if driving down once or twice a month is worth it to pick up meals so I don't have to cook too often."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time and was very pleased. The menu options are yummy. The wrap I got was delicious. I'm excited to try the meal plans. The beverage choices were perfect for this menu. Lots of items under 500 calories."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this new business a five star review. We were more than happy to see this restaurant concept a part of our community and have supported it with dine in, take out as well as their \"Menu Plan\" meals.  I am however a bit disappointed in the atmosphere of the place in the way of friendliness.  The food is good for what it is and I have no complaints as far as that goes but the employees and owners are so aloof.  Each time I have visited I feel like they are of the notion that THEY are doing ME the customer (their revenue) a huge favor.  No Thank You's, No How Are You's, No Can we help you, No Nothing other than taking my money.  I am a business owner myself and treat my customers like they are APPRECIATED! Without them, I am nothing but a bunch of rotten food and debt."}
{"text":"I needed a new place for lunch in Ayrsley/Whitehall and thought I'd try Clean Eatz.  We arrived right around 11am, and the place had just a few others inside.  The person at the counter was very helpful and helped us figure out what we wanted to order.  I settled on the Fiesta Flatbread and Mike N got the Wasabi Crab Wrap.  We grabbed cups and got some of the complimentary water/flavored water drinks and headed outside with our number.  Within in a few minutes, our healthy lunches were delivered and we started chowing down!  My fiesta flatbread was just enough food and my side of fruit yogurt was just the sweet desert that I needed.    We checked out the coolers with the grab-n-go meals briefly on our way out - seems like a great healthy alternative to takeout!"}
{"text":"When we walked in the manager was visibly fustrated by whatever was going on with his phone call. I had never been there before and  was looking to the girl at the counter for some suggestions. She stated she was  new there and she doesn't eat food like that anyway. Um....Wow....ok.....after taking forever to decide, I ordered the   Wasabi Crab wrap with side salad. It had Had absolutely NO Wasabi on it. I was also missing a dressing I had ordered. I had ordered ranch and balsamic vinaigrette. The ranch was absolutely terrible and they both tasted like they had come premade. I let the girl know my wrap was very bland and that it was missing the Wasabi.  Instead of offering  to take it back and fix it the way it supposed to be prepared, she left me with my wrap to talk to the guy in the kitchen. I was informed all they had was wasabi powder and it was very hot. Um....ok?! I ordered the WASABI Crab. I Was asked if she could bring me some. Never offered to have prepared properly. I was brought a ramikin full of prepared Wasabi Powder. So at the table I had to unfold half my wrap, Try to incorporate a wasabi paste that was supposed to be a drizzle onto the bland crab and unsuccessfully re-roll my wrap. Very very disappointed. Not once did the manager ever come over to apologize or do anything to make it right.  I also ordered the healthy nachos. They were good except for the fact that Everytime I would cut a piece of sweet potato fries the paper in the basket would tear and I was fishing paper off my fork before I could eat.   All in all I doubt I'll be back and I was very dissatisfied with my visit. The concept is great, the execution needs some serious work."}
{"text":"Fast, healthy, delicious, well priced. Get a meal now or meals prepped for later. Great concept with food that's consistently high quality."}
{"text":"I travel a lot so nice to maintain a healthy lifestyle while on the road...great alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"Subpar experience in comparison to South Tryon location. Very noticeable differences in the ambience of setting (not very welcoming) and food quality (ordered the Clean Eatz Nachos at the Fort Mill location and the chips were burnt - this never happened at the South Tryon location!).  I have been going to the South Tryon location for almost a year, and have always enjoyed every experience but it seemed to be slightly out of the way due to the location (I live much closer to the Fort Mill location). Given this 1st encounter at the Fort Mill location, the South Tryon location has a loyal patron without any concerns to location."}
{"text":"I'm so used to being out of town and having to eat horrible and mess up my routine. This place made it possible to stay on track and eat healthy! It is clean eating!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Thai wrap I ordered.  Very tasty and refreshing!  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Very healthy and great tasting. Atmosphere is a little overboard, but food was worth it.   Big boy burrito was delicious.   The salmon for the salmon wrap was over cooked."}
{"text":"Nice unexpected stop on a road trip. Fast, healthy, satisfying. Buy some of the take away desserts or meals as well.  A little hard to find at first, but keep trying."}
{"text":"I decided to try Clean Eatz this past week after growing tired of cooking dinner for one. Their menu looked great - turkey sloppy joe w sweet potato tots, manicotti with blanched broccoli, and balsamic chicken pita with lettuce and tomatoes were the three meals I ordered. I doubled up on the manicotti and sloppy joe. These meals were not only fresh and nutritious... but they were delicious.   And for 5 meals for $38 it just can't be beat!!  I was essentially an Instagram influencer this week... I must have told everyone who crossed my path that they needed to give Clean Eatz a try.   My only recommendation would be some minor tweaks to the website. When ordering, you are asked for your address - not until the end of the ordering process do you find out it's actually your billing address that is needed. Mine are different so that was a little annoying. Also the pick up times aren't really clear, if there could be more specific pick up times listed for the individual locations that would be a great addition to the site. Something I loved is how accurate the photos were. What I saw was what I got.   Pick up was so easy and I cannot wait for the South End location to open!   I already put my meals in for next week and plan to be a long time customer!!!  Keep up the great work.. and if you haven't tried it before ... you're missing out!!!"}
{"text":"Healthy eating at a good price. Quality food. Staff is always friendly. I would recommend Clean Eatz to anyone"}
{"text":"The hot wing wrapped up is wonderful compared to the other 2 items I have tried.  Not dry at all. Yay!!!"}
{"text":"It's a nice spot to eat for a healthy, low calorie alternative. The grab n go meals are excellent for busy people who are looking to watch their calories. There's a large variety to fit most tastes."}
{"text":"Downgrade to 3 stars because you can only choose between extra protein or low carb (only 1 of the 4 options: extra protein, low carb, no carb or gluten free) Only 4 stars because I travel from Huntersville to this area & they don't make it convenient for pick up times on orders (Mondays for normal orders & Tuesdays for special orders i.e. low/no carb, extra protein) Plus I feel if you pick from the freezer section that they need to vacuum seal their foods to prevent freezer burn & ice crystals. Not a fan of the turkey spaghetti but so far everything else has been good. I do like that your don't have to prepay on orders especially with my crazy schedule of getting down that way. Menus come out every Thursday & orders need placed by Sunday night."}
{"text":"Customer service was non-existent. Walked in, was immediately handed a menu and told to read it. When I said it was my first time in and I wanted more information, I was passed off to another girl who said I need to sign up for emails since all information is distributed via corporate email lists.  This place is supposed to offer meal plans, so you would think theres a chef or a manager available to inform you about the ongoings of this process. I was told nothing is dealt with at the actual store, all ordering and meals are made at and shipped from corporate.   If I'm looking to spend $100+ a week, I expect a courteous, knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Came in after working out for a healthy meal before heading back to work. Went in and explained that it was my first time and that I wanted to read over the menu a bit. It took me about 3 minutes to read over everything and not once did the guy at the register ask if I had questions. He was not rude, but very disengaged.. especially to a first time customer. He didn't tell me if drink came with the meal or not or that I needed to grab a number; luckily I had a water bottle in my bag and grabbed the first number sign I saw. He just took my order, handed me back my card  and left, I'm guessing to tell the kitchen so they could prepare it.    I ended up ordering a pick your own bowl with chicken, brown rice, onions, broccoli, & black beans.. very blah. No taste what so ever; no seasoning at all. Looking back I'm assuming that they prepare it that way for individuals with special diets, but of course I would not have known that prior to reviving my food because I was never informed. However then the sweet chili sauce I picked to go on the side was also a no; too sweet, no spiciness at all.  Needless to say I will not be returning. I'll bring my own healthy lunch from home or head down the street to Publix for a salad."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time on Monday and was extremely impressed!! Took home a couple grab n go meals to try out... I gotta say, I feel like I've hit the jack pot with this restaurant!! So I just stopped back by to stock up my fridge for the next few days. Not only is everything under 500 calories, but it's seasoned to perfection and packed with protein and nutrients. Not to mention it's SO FRESH AND SO CLEAN, CLEAN!!  Not to mention the meals are only $6.50 each.   If you're looking to transition to a healthier lifestyle, but don't have time for all the weekly shopping and meal prepping, then please check this place out! It truly is a lifesaver."}
{"text":"I'm familiar with Clean Eatz because of their meal plans. Today I had one of their made to order bowls with Cauliflower Rice, Brussel Sprouts, Mushrooms, Black Beans and Shrimp topped with Fire Roasted Salsa. The bowl was plentiful with flavor and didn't leave me feeling bloated afterwards. Lots of healthy options to create your kind of bowl and the server Sena was very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Good concept-healthy food made to order at a reasonable price. I ordered the small salmon bowl with 3 veggies. The salmon was the only redeeming ingredient. The portion was large and the fish tasted fresh. The veggies were supposed to be steamed but were not. One of my side veggies was asparagus. The bulk of the asparagus were end stems. I hope I will be able to post a picture.  Luckily I ordered take out and was able to make a reasonable meal at home."}
{"text":"If your a clean eater, this is the perfect spot! In a week of traveling through GA & NC it was so nice to finally find a healthy place to grab a meal!   For Calorie counters, everything is listed. Custom options and pre packaged meals also available."}
{"text":"This is a review for the meal delivery service. Owner Mitch has been expanding the delivery service options to buildings Uptown. He came last night to our building to discuss the product, the options, and provide meal package samples. Unlike Blue Apron and Hello Fresh, the meals are 100% ready to eat, no additional cooking and cleaning needed. (Ok, you are going to have to clean your own silverware...). I was impressed by the flexibility of the program and how truly healthy the meal options were. I frequently substitute out things (brown rice instead of white, egg whites only, specific oils I agreed of dressing for sauces, XYZ in the side) and Mitch noted that this was extremely common for them among their subscribers, who are largely people trying to eat extremely healthy (with their own needs: weight, heart, paleo, whole grain, sugar free, you name it) in a delicious and convenient way. All-in, a week seems to run $6-8 a meal, depending on how many meals you purchase and how many others are getting delivery at your location. For fresh, healthy, custom, deliciousness delivered, that is pretty impressive. Also, as a special, the delivery charge for the first week is waived!   We also walked away with two sample meals (yes, as you can imagine, some people walked away with more than they should have and Mitch was extremely gracious about it). The meals are portion controlled. That means if you need 3000+ calories a day, you will be hungry if you try to survive on three squares of just this, no two ways about it. But they are balanced meals, with healthy proteins and vegetables, and a moderate amount of carbs as whole grains. Dessert and snacks are not currently on the menu but coming soon. Each week has 5 lunch/dinner meal options plus a breakfast option. Also, the BPA-free packaging is both reusable at home and recyclable.   Based on the cilantro lime chicken I had for dinner last night and the steak and eggs breakfast burrito this morning, I am going to be signing up for this service right away. It isn't a subscription so I can just do the weeks I want and skip ones I don't or am traveling. Beats the lean cuisine frozen meals I've been living on lately!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken panini. Bread was only lightly toasted, obviously they either don't have a panini press or don't know the difference between a regular sandwich and a panini. Bread was so soggy I just ate the chicken and turkey bacon. The tomatoes and spinach were not very fresh. Tomatoes were mushy as was the spinach. For the money they charge I was expecting fresh crisp toppings from a place called Clean Eatz, but maybe they cook them. Don't know, just very disappointing. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Awful.   Do not use this dirty place w rude clueless staff .   Made appt and confirmed. Was stood up by manager.     Staff silly and rude"}
{"text":"I have yet to actually try my meals so why I'm giving them four stars... I'll update next week.   Anyways, walking in there are coolers on the right which are your grab and go meals. We came for the first time and per the website we came to those first.   However, there seemed to be some confusion about the lines, and where to order.  I'm not sure I'm correct, but this is my take. Register on the left, by smoothie machine is for dine in, there really should be a sign. If there is a sign, it isn't obvious, or I'm oblivious... not sure.  Anyways, we get 10 meals & order lunch.   He got the burrito bowl, and I get the wrap myself thin.   His burrito bowl was massive. Apparently, they are all the same size. The small, medium, and large indicates amount of protein that's in each bowl.  He ordered the medium chicken. It comes with three options he picked black beans, edamame, and Brussels sprouts.   There were a lot of sauce flavors to pick from, he went with the teriyaki.   I ordered the thin wrap with chicken, guacamole, and cheese. It was good af!   It was packed when we came in, and stayed steady till we left. They make it through the lines quickly so even if there is confusion your totally gonna get served quick.   There is water, lemonade, and infused water set out. I don't know If this is extra, I brought my own water bottle.   Give this place a shot, I hope to see more locations pop up with how people are watching what they are eating, and concerned about what is put in their bodies. I've tasted a few meals from co-workers & im pretty excited. I'll update my review next week after we start getting more into the menu, and pick up.  I have high hopes tho!!"}
{"text":"based on the menu and other reviews I was looking forward to checking this place out. the concept seems really great. clean food, freshly made, and they make to-go breakfast, lunch and dinner. with all the fast food and chain restaurants, this place really stands out. so I went today and decided to get something off their snack menu. they had a few veggie options but decided to go with the veggie platter. it was basically raw broccoli, old cucumbers, carrots from a bag and non crunchy celery.  dipping sides were hummus and tazaki. I figured you can't go wrong with veggies, but I was wrong. a few hours later I ended up with an upset stomach and threw up. I went in with high expectations but came out feeling sick. maybe this is for those who eat meat and not raw veggies. needless to say, I won't be going back again for veggies or any other vegetarian option."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and I thought I would give this place a try and I'm so happy I did.  Upon entering I was greeted by two very friendly employees that answered my questions and showed me around the grab and go stuff and made some suggestions.  On my first visit I had the Thai/Asian wrap is was very good and packed full of chicken and fillings, very fresh tasting. With any entree you get a choice of sides and a drink for prices starting around 7.99, I had the weekly side which was sweet and spicy slaw, which was also good. But you can choose from about 4 I think they had salad, fruit and something else.   On my second trip today I had the jalapeño bison burger which was excellent, the bison is $2 extra but totally worth it.  Instead of a bun you get a little flat little multigrain thing which was fine I bought the same thing before at grocery for sandwiches, the burger had pickled jalapeños low fat cheese and buffalo sauce and every bite was delicious. Such a great alternative to fast food.  They offer grab and go meals which are frozen I have not tried yet and they have weekly meal plans which are freshly made and refrigerated, I plan to try the meal plan asap.   Oh they have desserts which I didn't realize my first time but is bad because I'm trying to eat healthier, but I did grab a strawberry fudge today and it was excellent."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst place for food I've ever been to. I'm not sure how they're getting all of those positive reviews; I suspect they or the owners' relatives wrote most of the 5 star reviews. I wanted to give them a try so I went and bought two pre-made meals (BBQ chicken with brown rice & teriyaki chicken with brown rice and broccoli). I went home and when I warmed up one of the meals I was about to throw up after a 3rd bite. Some might say that I should try their fresh meals instead of frozen ones, but the fact that they sell the frozen meals with such bad quality should tell you enough about their ethics and authenticity. They're simply scammers."}
{"text":"Wow. First time getting in to Clean Eatz here in Ft Mill. Fantastic, freshly prepared clean food bowl is what I had..... Quinoa, brown rice, onions , black beans and Ahi Tuna. Delicious. They also offer prepared options that you can even pre order as a custom meal plan. Very solid and varied selection of items in the menu. Check em out."}
{"text":"Stopped by Clean Eatz to give them a try.  The offer dine in, carry out, grab and go, and meal plans.  I tried the \"build a bowl\"  mine had chicken, mushrooms, black beans, broccoli and sweet potato,  the lady who took my order recommended the sweet chili sauce.  My lunch was very delicious and satisfying.  I will definitely be back to try their other options."}
{"text":"First time yesterday - I liked the choices as they were healthy, varied and easy to stay on track with my WW points. The guy at the counter was great - enthusiastic and friendly. I had a bowl - cauliflower rice, shrimp, mushrooms, black beans, corn and cilantro-lime dressing on the side. It was pretty good; portion was small (I got medium but the guy told me sizes only applied to the amount of the protein you chose in the bowl). The shrimp tasted slightly underdone. I did NOT like that the two dressings I'd ordered were sitting on top of my food in plastic containers (ew) or that the guy bringing it out bare-handed had his thumb 3/4 down in my bowl. There were no forks out (in their defense I went to lunch late) and when I asked another employee, he gave me a wrapped plastic set of cutlery then proceeded to fill the fork bin. The forks all in a bin to be randomly handled didn't seem sanitary and there was some kind of old dried sauce on the sides of the napkin holder on the table. NOT a nasty place but just not as appealing as I'd hoped; they seem a lil lax about that aspect - space was just 'meh'. I also tried the buffalo cauliflower and it was basically a few steamed florets soaked in hot sauce with a side of FF ranch - not impressed, especially for the price. Parking, even at 2:30 was a pain and laid out very poorly (Ayrsley problem, not restaurant) and the business door was a bit tricky to locate.  I will be back because it is somewhere I can get a healthy lunch and will try other menu options. I will also update this review should anything be drastically different either way."}
{"text":"Great place to get some healthy food! Love the space and the customer service is great as well!"}
{"text":"Very friendly. I got the fiesta flatbread. It was delicious! I also got the side salad. I was extremely impressed with the freshness of all the ingredients. I also love the idea that they have no soda machine! So the temptation isn't even there! I love the fun, bright colors of the walls here. Very hip! I will for sure to return.   Only suggestion I have is being open longer.   So if you do nothing else healthy all day, at least get your butt up and come here."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Good atmosphere, and Mitch (Franchise owner) is the man!  Very helpful with meal plan info.  Prices are good.  Dine in or just grab meals to go.  Super excited this place is finally open.  No more meal plan trips to grocery store!"}
{"text":"This is a great concept poorly executed. All the flavors are bland. The vegetables are cut too large - think broccoli that needs five good bites to eat - and are almost raw which is fine in a salad but not a hot bowl.  This location is industrial and has a tv playing sports even though 70% of the clientele are women.   Ultimately I'm not left with the impression that the owner cares about healthy food or healthy living. It's just an income stream."}
{"text":"Just ordered my first meal plan and could t be happier.  The service was excellent, the food is tasty and filling.  They cater to individual needs(extra protein or half/no carb).  I'm definitely going back"}
{"text":"I tried Clean Eatz for the first time the other day. I got several meals and so far my favorite is the Cilantro Chicken & Rice. I'm a gal on the go and often do not have time to buy groceries and meal prep myself so this place is great. The pricing is great too per meal. I spent less per meal than when I would be busy at work and going through drive-throughs (and not to mention, so much better for you) Thanks CleanEatz, can't wait for my next order!"}
{"text":"Great menu variety, relatively cheap prices, and enthusiastic staff. Recommend checking out their grab and go meals. I'll definitely be frequenting this place more often before and after workouts."}
{"text":"The service is excellent! I enjoy going to get a healthy lunch right after my workouts. Alex is very helpful in helping me choose my meals. He always suggest great options for me!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping for a true clean eating place in Steele Creek; alas, this is a galant effort, but I feel like I am being a bit generous with 3 stars.  If you're a gym rat in need of a quick, easy meal, this could work for ya. If you're traveling and looking for a Vegetarian or Vegan option, you can build that here. But there is nothing particularly clean about the food sourced from a US Foods truck (per the chef). When I inquired about the sourcing of their meats, it was like deer in headlights....like they never heard the terms grass fed, pasture raised, antibiotic free. The response was minimally processed with little sodium....(I hope so!) You won't find organic options, and you'll find better looking salad greens at the Harris Teeter salad bar. The place was clean, despite the 3 girls at the front counter being overly attentive to their phones and lip gloss. And everyone was nice enough. The food I received was cooked to a good texture: broccoli and beans were not overcooked, i.e. \"Clean\" is a bit of a farce, although a step up from most people's everyday American diet."}
{"text":"I've ordered the meal plans several times and i just picked up five meals for this week. I get to work and unpack my bag of meals to find 2 or 3 meals very empty. There is barely any food in the container. I am very unhappy, I've spent lots of money at this place."}
{"text":"My daughter was working here, which was my reason to stop in and patronize. I had one of their chicken wraps and thought it was really tasty. The dining room was a little sterile feeling, but not bad. The TV was on, but I couldn't hear it, turned down too low. I would say the in dining room was just ok, but I feel like the food is healthy. I want to come back and try and pre-pared meals. You buy them frozen, bring home and heat up. My kids say they are good, although I haven't tried them yet myself."}
{"text":"I'm BACK! Always stop here while I'm in town to grab a bowl of cauliflower rice and salmon!   They now carry energy drinks! I grabbed a few cans of C4 to try. Since I enjoy their other products. I also tried the buffalo cauliflower with ranch and yum. Definitely has a kick!"}
{"text":"Tried it and I AM GLAD I DID! Here, you can have a wrap and a healthy side and not have the \"itis\" for the rest of the day!   The cool thing about this place are he grab-n-go meals that are prep'd and ready for purchase. Granted, you will still require a microwave to get the to-go meal hot and ready but it beats a frozen bag of over-frozen items. Besides, the wait isn't long during the normal weekday rush (11am-12pm) so you're in and out if you want to just order something from the menu! AND if you're not one for meal prepping your lunch for the week, you can just pay them to do it and pick all your lunches up from them, Viola!   The only drawback is the lack of organization when it comes to ordering. But they're still a little new to the scene, so I'm sure they'll get this figured out sooner or later."}
