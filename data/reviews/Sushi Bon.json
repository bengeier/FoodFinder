{"text":"I have not been into the restaurant yet.  But I order delivery just about every weekend.  It has become tradition now that I'm stuck babysitting 4 kids alot lately.  We get the party tray A.  And replace all the cheaper roll with better rolls. Usually ends up costing $45ish+ tips.   Not bad.    Sushi is very Fresh and taste..........Awesome"}
{"text":"Out of all of the 20 sushi shops in our Little Italy neighbourhood, I think that this place is the best.  I go there probably once a week and it is always yummy and consistent.  I have had some off experiences on the street with other sushi shops, but after 4 years in the area, this is my winner."}
{"text":"Honestly the best sushi I have eaten, it's also pretty cheap for all you can eat!  Staff are great, clean place and exceptionally good food!"}
{"text":"we ordered delivery, and had no real complaints about the food apart from the tempura being a little soggy and the miso being pretty cold. we ordered 2 vegetarian entrees, which were supposed to each come with a miso soup and a salad, but we only received one of each. the sweet potato roll we ordered also came in 5 pieces, as opposed to the 6 pieces stated on the menu. overall a decent meal, but we didn't appreciate being ripped off."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place at all! Well as far as I experienced it, take-out is ok, but not sitting in.  I went for all you can eat formula, and the waitress forgot some food from our initial order.  Also I ordered a Don (can't remember the name sorry), and normally it is supposed to be served in a bowl with rice at the bottom and an omelett with meat slices on it... Instead I got a plate with rice, a fried egg, and meat slices...  Plus it was not heated properly... No really don't eat in there!"}
{"text":"This is my most visited sushi place. Not the most amazing sushi I've ever had but certainly tasty and satisfies the craving when it strikes.  And I actually find that the service is pretty good. All the women who work there are really sweet and fairly attentive."}
{"text":"Its a cozy little AYCE Sushi joint. For AYCE sushi its pretty much as good as it gets, and they have pretty good quality indigents and fish and meats. They have a small chinese menu which is good however their specialty is their superb Hot menu which most AYCE places are severely lacking in. Their Yakatori sticks, fried foods are too die for and my favorite in the city.   Theres sushi's places but don't be compared Nobu or Guu style to a all you can eat joint. They are putting quantity to your place and their quality is superb. The Staff are extremely friendly however they are obviously not Canadians so don't be so cruel. They speak english perfectly and will serve you correctly, the other reviewers i think are Haters!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Chef was trained in japan. Been a loyal customer for 6 years, and converted many friends."}
{"text":"Nah.   Terrible service. Asked for siracha four times. Got spicy mayo once when earlier I asked for no mayo on anything. Got someone else's roll, noticed so finally that girl at least got her roll. Waited for my soup and salad to come. Got my roll after a bit of a wait, though there was a girl who was here before me that was still waiting for hers after I heard they made her the wrong rolls. Asked for my soup and salad again... Got it after my roll.   Then there was a family who was doing the buffet deal and the dad made sure he got his money's worth because he took it upon himself to get up and ask the waitresses himself because they were ignoring him.  Fish was good but wasn't amazing so my tummy was like meh.  So naaaaaah."}
{"text":"I frequent Sushi Bon at least once a month. Their rolls are consistently good and fresh. Try the arctic roll; those things are like crack!  I only give it 4 stars because of the lack of professionalism of the staff. More than a few times we arrived at lunch at 12 pm only to find no one at the restaurant! (it opens for lunch at 12) I could see if they were running a bit late opening, but no one was even in the building. This happened to us about 3-4 times. Not to mention half the staff are swearing sweatpants? Very unprofessional.  If you don't mind being served by someone who obviously doesn't care about your job, the sushi is worth it."}
{"text":"Had an amazing delivery experience here!  The food was fast and fresh. Well priced for what you get.  The Red Dragon Roll is awesome!"}
{"text":"Usually a frequent diner of nearby Sashimi Island - I decided to stray and give Sushi Bon a try as they are rated exactly the same. I would give this place a 2.5.  The good: fish is fresh, grilled octopus is tender, the seaweed salad is seaweed salad and the miso soup is a little bit sweet.  The bad: service is bad. I must have asked for tea and water 3 times before I got it, I also neglected to get refills on ginger and wasabi. The sashimi slices are small, almost all the rolls come with mayo or tempura bits, hard to escape. Do not order any dessert except for ice cream - the deep friend french toast made me gag.  A very strange note on service - when the waitress was clearing our plates she left her own tray of dirty plates previously cleared from other diners on our table top as she went to serve another customer - it stayed there for 5 minutes?! Gross.  SASHIMI ISLAND ALL THE WAY."}
{"text":"Bof. J'ai vu mieux, beaucoup mieux dans le domaine à Toronto. Une enseigne qui vivote car il n'y a rien d'autre ouvert le midi dans le coin. De grâce, n'y perdez pas votre temps et allez chez Sushi D, deux portes plus loin."}
{"text":"Sushi Bon used to be a fave but sadly they've become 'all you can eat', so get ready for some sub-par fish and waiters who fill your water every time you take a sip..."}
{"text":"Used to live in the neighbourhood and would go there all the time - I still make the trek now that I've moved, skipping over the Bloor St. Sushi Strip in favour of my fave place on College.  First of all, the hard-working waitress you will encounter at almost anytime of day or night is the best. She's a total sweetheart and always does an amazing job.   I usually go for AYCE (whenever I have friends or family new to Toronto/sushi in general, I always bring them here) when I used to work in the hood, I'd get takeout. Fast and friendly, and very filling!  Lots of AYCE sushi joints load up on rice with very little fish and toppings in regards to their rolls - not so with Sushi Bon. Generously portioned special rolls are a welcome change, and thick cuts of fresh sashimi melt in your mouth.  My favourite dish on the menu: beef sashimi - cooked for a second or two, sliced up paper thin, and served alongside a flavourful ponzu sauce.  Love this place! gonna go tomorrow methinks! yum!!"}
{"text":"I don't normally go for AYCE anything because I know that I can't eat that much and the price is usually so inflated that a la carte makes more sense. But I hadn't eaten all day, I'd walked around ten miles, and this was the first restaurant I saw that wasn't fast food or Italian. So we went in.   AYCE dinner was somewhere around $20. Pretty decent price. You get to choose from a big menu, so you definitely have options to play with. I suppose if we knew what to expect from the food, we would've been ordering differently. Or not at all.   Don't get anything with crunch on or in it. It makes your roll ALL crunchy stuff and very little fish/veg. As I was trying to take the crunch out of the interiors of one of our TWO 8-piece crunch and something rolls (because, mind you, we didn't expect it to make our sushi so dry and flavorless), the server comes over and tells me I can't do that and I have to eat all of it. What the fuck? You serve me a substandard product and I have to eat it? In what world? I understand if I was actually \"wasting\" the food, but come on. It was pretty obvious that it was stale.   Now the sushi chef is glaring at our table. The sushi pizza we got on a whim is all rice and overcooked. I can't eat that rice. It's really bad. But again, \"You have to finish it or we will charge you.\" The karaage was surprisingly good. The sashimi was hit or miss; I would say 50/50. I would avoid ordering any of the sushi rolls because they were mostly average (or covered in crunchy crap).   I find it pretty funny that their website lists one set of prices, but also tells you that \"online prices may not be updated to reflect the actual pricing in restaurant.\" Then why the hell are you posting that on your website? That's baiting and false advertisement. Their website's photographs are nothing like what you actually get on your plate; there is very little in the way of aesthetic here. It's simply \"put on the plate and bring to the table.\"    I know it's AYCE, but you can at least make it look good before I figure out that it's not."}
{"text":"Sushi Bon is false advertising, unless 'bon' means 'crap' in some other language.  Dried out rice (that I expect had been sitting there for hours); tasteless fish; chewy, heavy tempura. Anyone who's actually had good sushi will be able to tell that this place is not good."}
{"text":"Cozy,warm,with friendly service, with a great menu. The food was exceptional,nicely plated , showing pride in their work. Cold beer with a nice selection and decent prices. Really a great to eat , give it a Go!"}
{"text":"Although the sushi was great and for a great deal. The food made me very sick and ruined my valentine weekend"}
{"text":"I liked the look of this super cute little sushi joint so gave it a shot.  Loved the presentation of my sashimi plate too, had never seen any place anywhere press the wasabi into a darling little leaf shape before or do anything more than plop the green clump alongside the ginger; however I was quickly disheartened by the look and taste of the fish as it began to dethaw and turn everything into a soggy mess.  Not tasty, or pretty."}
{"text":"The mighty has fallen. This used to be my joint yesterday, making weekly dine ins; however, since the sisters are no longer in charge of service, the device has become really bad. Food takes forever to get to the table and they forget orders. I don't get how a restaurant with 9 tables can be so poor on speed with 4 servers, 2 manning the sushi bar, and 3 in the kitchen. Very inefficient.  Only when the food arrives, you can forget the above, but memory recall is prevalent when it is time to pay."}
{"text":"Was expecting mediocre to good,  but it was instead fantastic. Everything was fresh and well-prepared, and the dinner price for $17.99 is the best I've seen for a Saturday night in Toronto. Sashimi, sushi, teriyaki, tempura and even dessert were all among the best we've had, including from much more expensive AYCEs. Try the \"Stir fried butter mushrooms\";  a generous helping of shiitake mushrooms in this amazing sauce.... ravishing. I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"This place looks nice but the food sushi isn't very good. Went there for dinner around 6:00 pm. The miso soup was a little more than warm and a little weak compared to other sushi restaurants. The seaweed salad, and tempura foods were really good and fresh but the actual sushi was fresh but tasted weird. Either way we said we weren't happy with the food and the management was loud, rude and disruptive to other patriots. Let's just say that we definitely will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but service needs improvement. It wasn't busy at the time. About 3 other tables when we came in and food came out in timely manner. They were there for water refills and cleanup, however our order was wrong on several occasions where items would be missing or something we didn't order was given or you got more than you asked for. The worst part was at the end where we ordered desserts and we were given them on played, but we needed it separated. My friend asked for some bowls so that we could separate them, but was denied. So we ended up having to use the plates and left over bowls from the last order. Finally, once my friends paid cash they weren't provided change despite us waiting for some time.  Side note, weekday night pricing is around $23 before tax, not $20. Not a big difference as either one doesn't make it worth going to. Should you decide to visit, hopefully their service has improved."}
{"text":"We came here for all you can eat sushi since the place nearby was closed.   There are a few menu options here. The $15.99 all you can eat, an extended menu with more options for $19.99 and then the a la carte menu. We did the $19.99 ayce menu.   The staff is friendly. There were only 2 other tables, as we had a late lunch/early dinner at around 4pm. The service was little slow to start with, but attentive after we put in our our first order.  I don't eat AYCE regularly and prefer a LA carte, although in university I enjoyed it.   The salmon sashimi was small in size, probably abput 2/3 the usually you'd get at most places, but nice. They tasted smooth and fresh. The honey garlic shrimp, steak and chicken teriyaki were all above average options.  The sushi was a little disappointing. They certainly looked tastier than they tasted. The red dragon was OK, but underwhelming. The flavor just didn't end up blending well. The arctic roll was tastier, but if you've never had it, the skin around it can be a bit gooey or stretchy like a rice noodle, so like my husband, it's not everyone's cup of tea.  I've had much better, but still not bad. The spicy salmon maki has good texture, but too much sauce.  The hand rolls are heavy on tobiko. The avocado crispy handroll had mayonnaise and completely overpowered the avocado. I don't like mayo, so that wasn't pleasant for me at all. The crispy salmon handroll and the tuna handroll were tastiest of the ones we tried. The nigiri is decent, but heavy on the rice.   I was looking forward to the ice cream, so I ordered a scoop of green tea and vanilla. The first bite of green tea I had was all freezer burned. My husband ordered the deep friend toast with vanilla ice cream and it consisted mostly of deep fried toast and little ice cream. That was a disappointing was to end a meal. We both gave up on the food and didn't really eat the dessert.  The hostess was nice, but there are many tastier restaurants to hit, so we will not return."}
{"text":"There's nothing I like more than consistency...   I like my socks in one drawer, my briefs in another... prefer clouds in the sky and grass on the ground...   Sushi Bon is hands down the most consistent sushi place I've been to in Toronto, and that alone deserves a fiver on the ol' star-o metre.   I've been going to this joint for years and have completely fallen for this place based on the service, speed and quality of food. The standards are high considering the low cost of the all you can eat menu.   Last time I was there, the sushi chef wasn't happy with some of the product so he literally walked out of the store and bought some at the college market directly next store. Maybe it's poor planning or quality control, but to me, it's a guy who gives a damn about his job and it shows in the quality of the food.   Would highly recommend this joint to anyone who is looking to expand their sushi game to other parts of the city. I would try to stay away from high peak times as the restaurant isn't that big, it can easily fill up.  The Mango Crispy roll is legit - also can't go wrong with a spicy crispy roll... the spicy mayo may have drugs in it, it's that good."}
{"text":"I ordered from Sushi Bon via JustEat.  I cannot comment on the accessibility or gendered aspect of the bathroom nor on the cleanliness.  I wanted to order sushi delivery at my new place and decided to try Sushi Bon.  For me, the selling point was $10 chirachi.  Oh I love chirachi.  I wanted to order my partner a vegetarian bento box, but surprisingly, they didn't offer one.  Instead, I ordered him a vegetable tempura \"meal\".  It was only $8 so I was willing to give it a try.  The food took almost an hour to arrive, which for sushi can be typical.  I had no issues with delivery.    The food itself was good but not GREAT.  My Chirachi meal was awesome!  The fish was very fresh, as was the rice and garnish vegetables.  My partner's tempura was good but not GREAT.  But it did arrive warm and crispy, so I like that.  My biggest \"gripe\" would be that the miso and salad that came with our meals were awful.  However, this is a problem with generally with Canadian-style sushi restaurants and not Sushi Bon specifically.    I'm going to try ordering from them again, but this time, focus on vegetarian rolls.  WISH ME LUCK!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but service was super slow. The server was probably new but she was dropping stuff and spilling soup on customers. I was actually frightened when she would give us our food or pick a empty plate up.  Like I mentioned before, the service was extremely slow.  The server did not bring us any chopsticks, plates or any wasabi until we asked her after we received some food.  Food took forever even though there were only 5 other tables at any given point.  Even our bill took 5 minutes to come! Food was decent but for the price I can't really complain.  Menu was quite limited but the food was still tasty. Probably never coming back, other options in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"First, try the arctic roll. Second, they have an all-you-can eat just like every other sushi joint on College.  You get what you pay for.  All-you-can eat at any of these places tends to be mostly rice.  If you want quality, they can and will deliver.  Just order a-la-carte.   I like the atmosphere here more than the local competition.  It is simple, and clean and they have a patio."}
{"text":"Okay, time for an update...So this place is slightly better than it was a few years back. The service is somewhat better (apart from the waitress asking us if we're having the AYCE menu or not before we've had a chance to sit down and think about it). The one thing that I discovered on my last visit was that the $11 bento box lunch is a good deal. As mentioned in my previous review, there's no \"Lunch Special\" per se (oh Thomas Keller, don't get me started, but I digress...) however the bento box meal is pretty much that. The rice arrives in the shape of a heart, everything is fresh and well put together. So, for that, I've upped it by one star. Good times."}
{"text":"Quite good for the price. They didn't use too much rice which I find is rare at AYCE sushi places.  Food came quickly, but the service was on the poor side as it took us leaving for a smoke and coming back for them to notice we had finished everything and were ready to order more.  If I was in the area and craving sushi, I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This is the second sushi place I have tried in Toronto this month since I've moved here, and I have to say that it is my favourite so far. At dinner time the all-you-can-eat menu was $14.99 for all the black items on the menu and the $17.99 for everything! The sushi I tried at Dundas Square called \"Spring Sushi\" was 23$ or something per person for all-you-can-eat and I didn't like it! In my opinion   Sushi Bon is much better and much cheaper and you can park at Metro near by! This was the cheapest all-you-can-eat sushi I've ever had and it was delicious, and the value for my money was fantastic! I was expecting it to be mediocre due to the price but I really enjoyed it!   The waitress was very sweet and came to check on us a lot, and it was around 9pm on a Thursday night when we went. It was relatively quiet, only 3 tables were occupied including us! They also have a very pleasant patio to sit on outside, but it was a bit chilly when we went so we stayed indoors!"}
{"text":"AYCE is a great value. $17.99 for Dinner. All rolls and sashimi were fresh and delicious. Can't stop raving about the avocado."}
{"text":"We've only ever ordered take-out from this place, so I can't comment on the service in the restaurant. However, no complaints! Which is great, because we order from other restaurants where one thing or another isn't going right.   Delivery is always prompt and the delivery guy is always very polite. This may be because we live pretty close to the restaurant, so there's no additional traffic factor? A few times he was so fast that my husband wasn't ready to pay, and the delivery guy didn't seem to mind the extra few minutes it took to get everything together, which probably made him a bit later for his other deliveries.   Food is always hot, no mistakes, and I like how they go through the extra effort of cutting holes in the styrofoam take out containers so the food doesn't get too soggy (a little can't be helped)."}
{"text":"I was recently taken on a date here, and I was pleasantly surprised by the food.  I'll admit it, I had read two or three Yelp reviews before heading out, and it didn't sound promising.  Neither did the date, really, but I'll always try something once.  I arrived just before my date did, and saw that the place was completely empty.  If I had been on my own, I would have turned back around and found another option.  I found the decor to be anything but warm, and the lighting was rather bright.  I quickly noticed that they had a curtained off, raised wooden platform area in the front window, and a low table for two with cushions on the floor.  It was like a private booth, perfect for people watching.  I told the waitress that I wanted that table, and I slipped off my shoes and stepped inside.  It felt like being in a store window display, but as someone who loves the spotlight, I felt right at home.  There was an orange paper string lantern beside me, and the ambient light was more welcoming than the rest of the space.  When I saw the options for AYCE (all you can eat), I decided to go with the 17.99 one (option 2) because I could get anything from the regular menu that way, and I love sashimi and nigiri sushi.  It was a bit disappointing that option 1 for 12.99 only included rolls, but at least it included premium rolls like the Green Dragon.   What I loved: -The CN Tower roll:  mostly because of the \"homemade sauce\".  Whatever it is, it rocked. -The salmon sashimi: cut very well, very fresh  What wasn't great: -Green dragon roll really lacked in flavour, and the tempura was soggy -The tuna sashimi; wasn't a great quality looking fish, and didn't taste as moist or buttery as it should have.  What I hated: -The Spicy Tuna roll; I couldn't even tell if there was tuna in the roll.  It was completely mushy, and the tempura flakes were soggy, and it all just fell apart.  We definitely got our money's worth and more in terms of how much we ate, and the quality was better than places like Big Sushi, and many other copy-cats in The Annex, but I found that some of the rolls fell apart because the nori wasn't bound tightly, or not enough overlap was applied.  The service was pretty rough.  It was the first time I was asked what I wanted to drink before there was tea on the table, and then the tea wasn't replenished until we had already finished our meal, even though our cups had been empty for an hour, and we weren't drinking anything else.  Even after we had finished dessert, and the waitress had cleared our table of all dishes, she didn't bring us the bill until we asked, and we were the only people there!  It wasn't as bad as the reviews I had read, and I think I would eat there again, but it did feel rather odd being the only people in the entire restaurant.  As cute as that special booth in the front window is, I'd have to weigh my options carefully."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from just-eat.ca. Was only 50 minutes for delivery and the prices were decent, so no complaints there.  However, my maki rolls were icky. Mayo and tempura take over these rolls. The yam roll was soggy.  The salmon wasn't noticeably terrible (although that might just be because it was covered in 1/4 cup of tempura).   I might order there again but definitely not a roll that includes mayo or tempura if there was a discount through just-eat. But probably not. These are the most highly caloric rolls I have ever eaten and are gross."}
{"text":"Out of all sushi places I have been to, I was not pleased. I'll start off with taste, which I found mediocre, personally. The miso soup was cold, the soy sauce was too sweet, the ice cream was nearly frozen and not pleasant and the sushi wasn't as good as I had hoped.  The costumer service here was exceptionally dissatisfactory, they were misleading and uninformative.  Great location, lots of potential but definitely lacking something, I would not recommend this sushi place there are others far better than this one if you are looking for some really great tasting sushi."}
{"text":"Five stars for the tender and delicious chicken yakitori, grilled eggplant and chicken teriyaki (the latter brought to us by mistake but the highlight of the meal.)  Ten stars for the waitress who handled our concern about the far-from-fresh tuna with great aplomb and class. She was a serious asset to this place. She deserves a better forum for her skills.  Zero stars for the rank and clearly foul tuna sashimi that was not only poorly cut, but tasted of food poisoning before my mouth was even closed. I subtly removed it without chewing and quietly brought it to the attention of the aforementioned awesome waitress. We felt badly for her when she came back (i.e., was told to come back) to our table and tried to convince us that the fish was fresh (\"the chef wants me to tell you that the colour is a bit strange but it's good\".)  The rest of the appetizers were okay, if uninspiring. The rest of the sushi and sashimi was gross, albeit not dangerous tasting. The spicy rolls were so drenched in spicy sauce we began to wonder what the chef was trying  to hide.  We left feeling more than a little underwhelmed and feeling pretty bad for the poor waitress and kitchen staff, who were doing their best.  I know AYCE is not high art, but this was a sushi farce. For the same price (and in the reasonable vicinity) Simon Sushi, Sashimi island, Sushi Island and Bikkuri are all much better options."}
{"text":"I went to this place on Jan 2 because I had a hankering for some AYCE sushi again. I wanted to go to Sushi Island but it was closed. Rolled down the street a little further to see that this place was open; empty, but open.  Like the other reviewer said, the pricing is like sushi island. For $12 you get AYCE sushi menu only and for $20 you get the full menu. Ordering from the whole menu I actually thought their food was decent. Although not as good as Sushi Island IMO, their beef sashimi was good, their agedashi tofu was good, and I found their sushi rolls to be pretty good as well. I did not experience any of the fall apart mushy fish that another reviewer did.  One downer was of course the lack of enoki beef roll on their menu, and I heard the microwave go off a few times which means something was being defrosted/heated quickly. I guess I can't fault them because  nobody was in there and we ate at like 3pm.  Maybe my standards are quite low but I found this place to rank number 2 behind Sushi Island on my list of AYCE sushi in downtown toronto. With the lineups that Sushi Island gets on a regular basis, I wouldn't hesitate to go down a few more blocks and eat here."}
{"text":"My fiancé LOVES all you can eat sushi (personally, I'd rather go to a more authentic Japanese restaurant and enjoy quality over quantity). We have recently  started including Sushi Bon in our rotation of other AYCE sushi places. Not only is this place cheap ($19.99 per person, Friday night - weekday pricing is even cheaper), but it also has a patio, so you can enjoy your sushi outdoors in the summer!  A few hits:  - Sashimi - Quite tasty - we had salmon, surf clam, eel,tuna - Seeweed salad - Beef & Lily mushroom roll (aka. enoki mushroom) - Chicken teriyaki - The sushi rolls weren't thick with rice like at other AYCE restaurants - The ice-cream tasted creamier and better quality than other japanese restaurants  A few misses: - Seeing yellowtail sashimi on the menu (limit: 3 pieces per person) made me hopeful but it tasted quite fishy - spicy salmon chips is literally spicy salmon on Pringles chips (I found this combo to be kinda odd)  - No soupy udon noodles - Honey garlic shrimps (doesn't compare to the Rock Shrimp at Sushi D)   I'm sure you will find us back here sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bon is almost always empty. I thought it was because there are a couple other sushi places in the same strip, and poor Sushi Bon just ends up neglected cause it's the last one.  But no. Sushi Bon has the same deal as Sushi Island and Sushi D, the $12-$15 all-you-can-eat Maki, but the selection at Sushi Bon just doesn't cut it. Their menu appears to be knocking off Sushi Island, but the rolls are sloppily made, fall apart easily, and use way too much rice. I got a couple rolls that were covered in salmon, and their salmon wasn't great either, a little too stringy and sliced too thick for my liking.  The service was a bit lacking, I think the staff are used to an empty restaurant and sometimes forget to serve the customers who are actually there. It took about 15 minutes to get someone's attention to bring us the bill, and we were one of two groups in the entire restaurant.  I went in the summer and the place was a sauna -- guess their AC only comes out of one vent in the floor, not a good thing for raw fish.  If you don't feel like waiting in line, or if you want fast delivery, Sushi Bon is a decent option, just don't expect sushi that will change your life."}
{"text":"Located on the south side of the street in the western part of Little Italy the place has a nice sized patio, without any umbrellas. We opted to sit inside because the sun was till beating down hard, and without any cover it would have been too hot. Inside the place is small, feeling smaller than it is because of a painted black ceiling and wall paneling that reaches halfway up the wall also painted black. It really could do with a makeover to lighten the place giving it some much needed life. We had a young waitress who seemed clueless about what she was doing and as the place quickly filled the service became more erratic and confused. Everything is available on brown/purple rice and I opted for a bowl of chirashi that after the long wait proved really disappointing. It was plated in a really small box and showed little thought to presentation and sadly, flavour. Everything tasted bland. As the place filled up it became increasingly noisy and too hot for enjoyment, making it a less than pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for AYCE as I lived in the area for a while, and Sashimi Island isn't open for lunch.    Sushi Bon is open for lunch AYCE and it has a patio too.  Also, if I get off of work late I can come here and they still serve AYCE up until closing time.  (Many places stop an hour or half hour prior).  Once I came here and the only table was the one where you kneel in the front window.  No thanks!  The grill stuff is fine, I like the beef teriyaki a lot.  But they only serve mayo as dip with the katsu and other deep fried stuff.  The sushi rolls have WAY TOO MUCH tempura flakes, and they taste kind of stale sometimes (which is surprising since they use so much you'd think they don't have time to go stale??)  The dynamite roll has too much mayo, as well as too much tempura.  A nice balance is needed in sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"Freshest Sushi on College street.  Love this neighbourhood gem!    The family that runs it is lovely and will make you whatever you want (even as far as running to the store if they don't have the ingredient on hand)."}
{"text":"We order catering from them.  Everyone was so impressed with their food  and raved about their quality.  It was fresh and tasted awesome!  We are very happy with their service, it was precise and professional!  Thank you Jane and your team for a superb service!"}
