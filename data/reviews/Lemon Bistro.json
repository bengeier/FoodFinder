{"text":"I have never given 1 star to any restaurant because no matter how bad it is there's no reason for 1 star, until this happened to me. Came in with a group of 5 on a weeknight around 8pm. We didn't have a reservation, but saw some empty tables outside, thought we'll give it a try since the review on Yelp was good. Walked in they were busy, there's really only 1 waitress there, so we waited a few mins until she would get us seated. When she approached us, we got denied for a table when she knew there's 5 of us. In confusion I asked if the tables empty were all booked up, her respond was no but she didn't have the capacity for 5 people. We were even confused at that point, can't they add a chair or combine two tables together? I have never heard of a restaurant that doesn't serve groups of 4 or more, we were definitely offended at this point and we left."}
{"text":"I had a caramelized pear salad, it was delicious! And for mains, I had beef shank and my friend had the cod. I find the beef a bit salty, the fish is very tender. Portion is good. Love to support local family restaurants! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and gorgeous ambience  Excellent service. Not sure if they still have it but the roasted red pepper salad with their house bread is just divine. All of the paintings are done by the chef and owner too!"}
{"text":"This wonderful little spot is fantastic.  You will need to make reservations as it fills up quick on weekends.  The menu is small, and simple with something for every taste (chicken, meat, fish, vegetarian).  The food is fresh and fantastic.  We have never been disappointed.  Menu is a little pricey, but worth it.  Great date spot."}
{"text":"My husband took me to this cute place on my birthday.  I had freshly Home made pasta and he had steak and fritz! It was delicious!  We were very impressed with the great service.  Our beautiful server Rikko was so friendly and sweet! She made me feel so special on my birthday!  I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to go somewhere special for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with taste food and very good service. I ordered cod fillet and my husband ordered the seafood pasta, and i absolutely love both of them!"}
{"text":"Had a Friday night here for 6.   Great service.  Comfy cosy place with delicious food.   If u support local business, make sure this one is on your list."}
{"text":"Highly recommend!   Intimate setting. Friendly staff! Great location with amble parking at rear of plazas.   Delicious dinner. I ordered the poached salmon. Very simple dish. Served with mashed potatoes and greens. Its simplicity made it delicious. No fuss dish. I enjoyed it! $24. Dave had the steak served with fries and roasted veggies. He was on cloud 9... Actually he still in. The steak was cooked medium rare. I tasted it and it was worth every penny of the $35. For dessert we got the Nutella cake. Which is a layered white cake with nutella. The nutella is thinned a bit but you still get a strong taste. It's sprinkled with nuts. yummm. It tasted like ferro rochier. I'll be craving this soon I'm sure.  Dave ordered the custard crisp. The custard wasn't very sweet which was good cause the crisp was. I wish it weren't as sweet so I could taste more of the custard. But still a very good dessert. You eat it with your fingers, so I got a little messy!  Drinks: I got a ceasar and dave got a red wine. He liked his wine. My drink was okay.   Bill came up to $105 not including tip.    Dave kept saying (while eating his steak) we'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"A Saturday evening seating for four...old neighbours reconnecting after 10 years.  Although quite small inside the Lemon Bistro made up for their stature in delivering great food.  Low points were the men getting served first and the fries with the beef tenderloin served in a coffee cup. Our waitress was quite attentive right up until we paid our bill.  It was then that the tee-shirt & ballcap \"bartender\" (who didn't know how to make a simple margarita) started clearing our table and interrupting our jovial conversation.  We let it go, until the another tee-shirt staffer again barged in across our table and pulled smaller plates & water glasses, blocking our conversation with no notice as he reached across our table blocking our conversation.  No apologies from either.  Then the hammer dropped on us when we were told (@ 8:45pm) by the ball capped bartender that they needed our table for another sitting and that we needed to hurry up...whilst our wives were finishing up their full glasses of wine.  I was PISSED, but to avoid embarrassment with our guests, I met ball cap bartender at the front door.  I said to him \"that wasn't cool.\"  He simply remarked \"I appreciate this\", but I quickly and harshly replied \"well, I don't appreciate it and nor do my guests!\"  Ball capped bartender just thanked me and I noted that we would NEVER be back.  Thus, my one star for ruining what was a great night with great friends based on the very poor judgement of two individuals that simply don't get it when it comes to simple customer courtesy.  Too bad as the food was great, but the final piece of their customer service was atrocious!  Guess we found a real lemon, so I will find another gem next time in Markham, where staff treat their paying customers with respect and a spot that can handle making any drink desired...so many to choose from."}
{"text":"Absolutely dreadful service. They were heinously understaffed for a Friday night, the entire team consisting of 2 mildly inept, forgetful, schmoozy waitstaff more concerned with talking up large groups of older customers than serving the rest of the restaurant.   The food was only okay. They had no listed vegetarian option, which I thought had become the standard in decent restaurants since the early 90s. When asked, they simply whipped up some plain pasta with random veges mixed in. Embarrassing for $16.   My fresh fish of the day was haddock. Garnishes were decent but had no real taste, other than to be really salty or somewhat burnt. Had to wait a couple minutes to ask for fresh ground pepper.   It took about 5 minutes to flag down someone in order to ask for the cheque and another 15 minutes and two reminders for them to actually bring it. The mother and son duo sat beside us also were rudely ignored for the duration. \"sorry for the wait, guys\" said the waiter as he saw me arrive at the tipping portion of the bill. Too little too late.   Absolutely avoid unless you know you'll be throwing money around in which case they'll treat you like royalty. Otherwise, be prepared to feel invisible. Food isn't even worth the crap service."}
{"text":"We had been here before, the service and food were great. However for my girlfriend's birthday, we booked a couple of weeks in advance as we had a large party and also it was during Christmas season. We were already disappointed when they wouldn't allow us to bring a cake in, stating they don't allow outside food. Fine, we respect that. When we finally arrived, the service was still pretty good. However we were once again disappointed when 1 of 3 starters and 1 of 5 entrees ran out before we could order. We booked weeks in advanced and had a large party, how could the restaurant be so unprepared? I understand it is a small restaurant, but we would appreciate it if we were informed of the very limited quantities once we sat down. The food in general was actually very good, but when we had to pay, we were again caught off-guard when they could not separate the bills by person. Again, it would've been much appreciated if we were told ahead of time."}
{"text":"This is our first visit to Lemon Bistro, and it definitely will not be the last.  My husband and I are very excited to find such a high quality restaurant in our area. The only downside is the price point of their food and wines are very similar to what is charged downtown, though I feel it is well worth it. The interior is very homey and cozy, however, it would be nice if they had a patio for the summer!   They only have a few items on their menu and it changes weekly, so the ingredients are always fresh. In addition to the freshness, we absolutely loved the flavour profile of their dishes. We ordered an apple leafy green salad with almonds for the appetizer ($12), and absolutely loved the basil dressing. It was a bit tangy and very refreshing.  I had the seared haddock ($26), whereas my husband had the fettuccine ($19) made in house, which we paired with Reisling ($11/glass). Both were extremely delicious. The seared haddock was presented on a bed of potatoes, with tomatoes and shanghai bok choy,  topped off delicious deep fried onion strings. The sauce appears to be some sort of fish broth, which was tasty, as it was flavourful, but not salty. The best part? I didn't feel thirsty after the meal. My husband enjoyed his fettuccine dish, although the pasta could have been a bit more al dente.  Overall, we really enjoyed our meal, and would definitely return to see what new dishes they have next time!"}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT: 4/5 - Definitely a hidden gem in Markham. This family-run restaurant is small yet cozy. You could even see the owner in the kitchen cooking your meal. A little tight to accommodate large groups but it's comfortable for groups of 4.  FOOD: 4/5 - Always great. Their menu is different every time and only serves a few selection each day. I've tried their braised beef in pasta, and it was so flavourful and tender. You could expect a classic French cuisine, nothing too fancy pancy, just great food with a lot of care to the dish. I brought my parents here and they loved the food.   SERVICE: 4/5 - The owner was extremely friendly and we had a great time chatting with him over wine. He also shared a little history with the restaurant and his cooking with us.   OVERALL: 4/5"}
{"text":"Small gem tucked away in markham main street. High quality food cooked to perfection. One of the few steaks ive had where i got the medium rare i asked for. Generally overcooked in many restaurants. Family owned and would recommend reservations."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight.  We made reservations for 6pm and were seated promptly.  We brought our 3 children but I don't think it's a very kid friendly place.  Doubt they ever serve many children here.  It's more of an intimate couple date place.  Mostly tables for 2, as when we were there tonight.  Has around 30 seats and the place was full tonight.   The food is absolutely delicious.  Everybody finished their mains and the kids all had dessert and polished that off too.(not sure if that means that portions are small, or that my kids are greedy gluttons)  The menu was a choice of 4 starters, 4 mains and 3 desserts.  We skipped on the starters, nothing much that we really wanted.  For our mains, the 6 of us ordered 2 of the braised beef rib, 2 of the cod fish and 2 of the roasted cornish hen.  I personally ordered the cornish hen.  It was nicely roasted with rosemary.  Nice and flavourful, the breast was a tad dry but that's to be expected.  I tried a piece of beef rib too, it was succulent, tasty and just absolutely delicious.  Did not try the fish but my husband and 8 year old son finished their plates.  For dessert, we ordered 1 of each, for the children.  They were presented nicely and looked very appealing.(even to a non dessert eating person, like me)  Only little gripe was the service.  We could have done with more water but the lady owner was very busy serving everybody and her son, Dan,  had to help  out at the front too.  Food does take a while to come out but definitely worth waiting for.  Very nice family owned restaurant with outstanding food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with family. The place is very small but has a very cozy atmosphere, which was lovely. Service was very good... we were seated immediately and our waitress was very attentive. The menu is quite small and varies from time to time so there isn's a lot of choice. However, the food is homemade and the ingredients are very fresh so it ensures great quality! I ordered the haddock vegetables and potatoes. it was absolutely amazing and the broth was to die for. My brother ordered the steak frites which was a very large portion size, but was also very tasty. Overall, I thought this place was very nice and had great, fresh tasting food. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I have come here quite a few times and have never been disappointed by the food.  It is a bit on the pricey side but the service and food more than makeup for it."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Markham. Although menu changes depending on whats in season, everything sounded very appetizing. The pork chop is a much have as the meat is so tender and flavorful.   It can be a little crowded and chilly if youre sitting by the door in the winter time but will definitely come back again!  Make sure you make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Cozy and small little restaurant on main street Markham came here twice for dinner on the weekends. The service isnt bad, usual and standard.   The first time my pasta was a bit on the bland side but the shrimp was large and cooked well. It was also a friend's birthday and the gave us complimentary cake which was very nice.   I got the grilled pork chop the 2nd time, the serving was large and the meat was really tender and soft. I was pleasantly surprised! It came with sauteed greens and mashed potatoes which were great as well. For dessert I tried the lemon daqouise, which they said was house made, unfortunately it was very chewy on some parts and very hard other parts.   Overall, its not a bad place especially there isn't any other great bistros around in the area and prepare for very low lighting."}
{"text":"I wish there was the option to give half stars, because if there was I would give Lemon Bistro 3-1/2. Overall, our experience was fine and I would probably try it again, but I won't be rushing back. We called to make reservations. I asked for 7 or 7:30 and was told that 7:30 \"would be better\". Assuming that meant 7 was a busy time, we went to the area and were prepared to wander around for a bit...but the restaurant was almost empty, so we went in and were seated promptly.   Our waitress was very friendly and took our orders. I had the mussels and my husband had the salad. Both were good, although the mussels were quite spicy, something I wish was specified before ordering.   My husband ordered the pork hock and I had the pasta. His dish was prepared very well and the meat very tender and nice. My pasta however was very bland. the pasta noodles were overcooked and fell apart easily, making it hard to twist in my fork. The limited sauce had little flavour. The chicken and mushrooms in the pasta were the best part, but it wasn't enough to make me consider this a \"good\" dish. More like something I would make for myself at home and be only mildly satisfied.   When the server gave us our bill, she took away my husband's beer that he was not finished with. We didn't notice until it was too late.   All this said, I saw other dishes that looked pretty amazing, my husband's food was much better than mine, and despite the beer stealing, the waitress was very nice. The atmosphere made for a nice date spot.   It's not cheap though, coming to $77 for the two apps, two drinks and two mains. So I was hoping for a little better. I hope if I try this place again it will please me a little more."}
{"text":"What can I say? Excellent food, well prepared and presented, great service, attentive without being disruptive, all at a family owned / run restaurant that has a great vibe /atmosphere.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Had an absolutely amazing meal here. I tried a few different starters, including the New England Seafood Chowder, Shrimp Risotto, and Kale & Red Pepper salad, and was wowed by all three. I'll be back here again soon to work on their some of their mains! It's important to note that Lemon is very focussed on serving local food - they source lots of their produce locally (check out their Instagram to see for yourself) and their beer and wine menus are often full of local selections. Come support this amazing, family-owned business!"}
{"text":"When I first walked into the reataurant, I was greeted with a smile and it continued throughout the night. The food was delicious but the only reason why I wouldn't give this a 5 star is because the food can be OK the pricey side. But overall the food was great and the environment around us made is feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Nice little mom and pop cozy restaurant. Lighting was a bit dim for my liking. Our party ordered the haddock and pork loin which was delicious and well cooked. Menu however, was limited. It was displayed on a chalk board in the restaurant and changes daily. When I went for dinner there were only about 5 mains and no vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for my brother's birthday. A very cozy, relaxed yet classy setting. Not a very big place but tables were evenly spaced out so you could still dine comfortably. I assumed it was a family owned restaurant judging by the dynamic of the staff, there were only two staff working the tables and one cook. When I first sat down I was surprised by the handwritten menu. It was just one page so there weren't a lot of choices which can be a good thing if you're indecisive like me. We ordered the Cesar Salad, cold cod, and vegetable soup as appetizers. The vegetable soup was tomato based and very hearty as it had beans, chickpeas, etc... However, I found the soup to be just average similar to any other bean soup. But I was pleasantly surprised by the Cesar salad in particularly the dressing used. It's very different from other Cesar salads I had in the past, I couldn't quite identify what it was definitely savory without being overly creamy. The cold cod was quite nice with the citrus glaze, only complaint is the portion was too small.   For entrees, we ordered the steak, salmon, pork belly, and the handmade pasta which was all the entree options they offered. The steak was cooked nicely and the texture wasn't too tough, one of the better ones I've had. I really like the potato skins that accompanied the steak, thought that was a nice change as opposed to the usual fries. The pork belly wasn't bad but I thought is could've been more tender. My favourite would have to be the salmon and the handmade chicken pasta. The salmon was perfectly cooked and I really like the texture of the pasta. There were also sun dried tomatoes in the pasta which I thought added a nice touch and the sauce to noodles ratio was just right. Definitely not too creamy or acidic so highly recommended! And at last for dessert, we tried the lemon dacquoise (totally embarrassed myself trying to pronounce it, it's french) and the warm banana cake. Both were good but I think the lemon dacquoise stood out to me more so if you're a fan of meringue you should definitely check it out. It is a pricey place, most of the entrees were between $20-30 and the steak was $34 if I remembered correctly. Overall, the food was great and the restaurant had a nice atmosphere with a slight uptown elegance."}
{"text":"I am sure that the 4 things on the menu are well done, but to have only 4 options for dinner is very puzzling for me. The wine is $16 a glass which is pure robbery (especially for the wines they were offering) and the chairs are so uncomfortable we decided to get up and leave to go some where else. Sorry lemon but I don't understand how you could have regulars with such a limited menu!?"}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 5 star!  Not the fancy type of restaurant but solid fresh delicious food, real cooking and authentic taste, plus excellent service. What more can you ask for?  I've been here quite a few times, loved the service, cozy and warm ambience, they only serve what's fresh and in season. All the dishes I had were fantastic. Anything from salad, pasta dishes, pork chop with bone in to desserts tasted delicious with a homemade flare. Presentations were great as well!  Highly recommended if you live nearby. Please note this place is small, reservations recommended. If there's one down side to this restaurant-the menu is not extensive, as I said earlier they served fresh and in-season items so their menu changes from time to time."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over five years . The food and service are always top notch. They guys care and it shows."}
{"text":"Lovely family owned restaurant featuring a limited menu, but that's because everything is made fresh to order and they use locally grown food. We had the battered shrimp, seared cod, and lemon dacqouise. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, jumbo sized, juicy and well seasoned. Cod was done perfectly although it does take a while before your entree comes, so order an app while you wait! The broth and vegetables under the cod was absolutely delicious, so light and flavorful. Some may consider it bland but I think that depends on your flavor palette.  The lemon dacquoise was delicious, great for the sweet tooth and I recommend sharing as it can get super sweet. If you prefer light, healthy and non greasy but fulfilling food, this is a great spot to dine at. Would definitely come back. Expect a very small menu,  normally between 3-5 main options, a couple of appetizers and the desserts are verbally described to you at the end of your meal. Service is friendly, quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Went on Fri, Dec 15th and made reservations for 6pm. The place was small and very dim, a few parties came in looking for a table and they could not seat them until much later after 8:30pm, most of the restaurant was empty but I guess they were waiting for people who made reservations. I highly suggest reservations if you are going on the weekend. The menu was quite small, they change the menu weekly and they were all written on the chalkboard, only about 5 apps and 5 entree. I found the entree portions quite small and too expensive for the price. I was really looking forward for Italian food but was disappointed with what I received. I got the poached haddock and beneath it was some stewed tomatoes and potatoes and leeks. To be honest, the poached haddock was dry, which I don't know how you can dry out a fish by poaching it, and the potatoes tasted old. My friend got the meatballs with handmade pasta and she liked it, but both came in small bowls.  Anyways, it was nice to try, but I doubt I will be coming back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. Had always wanted to come here. Nice attire older crown 40+ nothing wrong with it probably the one who can afford the meal and enjoy quality food. $120 plus tax and tip for two with appetite, main, dessert and drink. Instead of paying similar price for the keg this is a great alternative. Not kids or family friendly just FYI."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Mom and pop and very cozy.  Great for date night. The food is fresh and tasty. The menu is different each day is how I understand. It's what's up on the black board. The service is good. And overall the restaurant is Not trying to hard."}
{"text":"A small restaurant with a limited menu, but the food is always great and the staff are very helpful and attentive. It might be helpful to call ahead and book a table, it can be quite busy. All in all, a perfect cozy little space for any occasion"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night around 7pm. Before coming here, I read the other reviews and I know that I might have some trouble dining here without a reservation. Luckily, a table left as we were entering. After the host checked if they were able to accommodate us, we were seated.  The first thing we got were the PEI mussels ($11) to share. I expected the dish to have more flavour to it. The main flavour I got was the cilantro (keep in mind that I'm not a fan of cilantro but that's not their fault). I tasted the broth and I thought it was quite bland as well. I've definitely had better mussels elsewhere.  Next, my parents and I shared three main dishes. The tagliatelle pasta with braised beef marina ($18) was a disappointment. The braised beef was tender but the pasta was very soft. This dish tasted very Asian inspired. The seared haddock with tomato chutney ($24) was okay. It wasn't as moist as it could be. I thought that the tomato chutney went very well with the fish but they didn't have enough of the chutney in the dish! The best dish was definitely the oven roasted chicken wrapped in prosciutto and mushroom ($23). The chicken was incredibly tender and I loved their pickled vegetables on the top.  Lastly, we shared two desserts. The creme caramel ($7) was standard and tasted good. However, the star of the meal in my opinion was the apple pecan crumble ($7). The top was crisp and the warm crumble was awesome with the cold vanilla ice cream.  Overall, I felt that they did a great job creating dishes that tasted homemade, healthy and not pretentious. I also thought that the price went well with the quality and quantity. However, the taste just wasn't there and I just didn't feel a welcomed atmosphere while dining at the restaurant. They were never rude to us but they weren't overly warm towards us either. I think that it's important to note that ambiance is an important part to an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Lemon Bistro is a really nice gem on Main Street. It's a family-run French cuisine restaurant that only serves about 4-5 different entrees each night, but there's something for everyone. Generally it's: steak + fixings, a pork-based dish (pork hock, pork chop, etc), pasta (accompanying chicken or braised beef, or maybe veggie based), a fish dish, and sometimes lamb chops.   What's great about lemon bistro is the level of care they put into everything- appetizer, entree and desserts. Pork chops for example are always well seasoned, flavored and tender, and come with variety of vegetables. Also, from their website it notes they have their own garden, so I assume at least during the spring, summer and fall seasons, much of their vegetables are grown by the family.  The ambiance is really nice - it's cozy and quaint. Best to call and make reservations (especially on fridays/Saturdays) since they often have regulars or on occasion small parties. It's a nice place to take family and friends."}
{"text":"I rarely give full rating but this place really surpassed my expectations. It was my first time at this restaurant and I was a bit sceptical because I saw everyone sipping wine in an intimate setting and I was with my mom as we walked by looking for a place to eat.. I thought it would have been too posh for us and looks like from the crowd that it might be a bit expensive for us. But luckily we gave it a try and OMG! This was the the most well deserved restaurant at their price point. Everything was fresh and hand made. Their service was also well deserved, the waitress was very helpful and very willing to give you guidance for us new customers.  Their menus was small but that's OK because everything on the menu was unique and fresh. Their appetizers is about $9 and their dinner items range from $18-$30.   My mom ordered the poached cod and this was really good. The fish flavour came through with potatoes and strong beans. It wasnt too salty and too much spice. This was $26 but it was a decent sized fillet.  I ordered the \"the pork chop\" and this was definitely the best pork chop ever. Every bite I took I thought I was eating a nice piece of steak! It was seared perfectly with a nice seasoned crust and the bone in steak was huge! It looked like 14oz of meat over a bead of mixed stewed beans and chopped coliflower. That was well worth $23!  We finished of to share a Lemon dacquoise. And that was another amazing dessert, it was very light!  I'm definitely adding this restaurant to the top of my list!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Some great local local beer choices. Just the seating is a bit too tight. Not very comfortable."}
{"text":"They change their menu every week. The service was good initially. We got there at 605pm and the food came at 707pm . We waited literally an hour for the food but when I talked the the manager his first reaction was not to apologize but to tell us we only waited 35 mins because they had a timer in the kitchen. I mean we knew how long we waited...  anyways Later he came and apologized and gave us a free meringue cake.   The food was average to be honest. The shrimp salad was very mediocre. I can make better shrimps than they do."}
{"text":"My beautiful girlfriend and I came to this restaurant for our 6 months anniversary.  The environment was very warming and it felt like a good atmosphere for families too.  The service was excellent, as the servers were really welcoming and friendly.  Overall the food was fantastic and the desert was my favourite part.  The food tasted very fresh with their ingredients grown in their backyard."}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant a few times so I always wanted to try it. My kids reserved a table for an early Mother's Day this year. I was excited to try it but slowly I lost interest...  first of all, the menu is on a blackboard and they didn't tell us that was the whole menu. We waited 15 minutes thinking a menu would come... but I guess the blackboards the only thing. Pretty hard to see if you didn't bring your glasses.  First thing I noticed was how loud it is in the restaurant. The music is quite loud on top of three or four tables talking over each other like it's a contest. The washroom was the only place we could get a few minutes of peace... seriously way too loud and they should really just turn down or off the music when it's already so loud in here. We asked to move to the inner area so that it was a little quieter but they said we couldn't. There's two or three tables available and it's almost 9pm, I doubt there are that many more reservations... Waited for food for an hour. This isn't even an exaggeration. Ordered at 7:40 and I'm currently writing this at 8:45 and it still hasn't come. Only two bowls of soup came which took 20 minutes to make. I told them it's been an hour and they didn't even apologize, just said 5-10 minutes... they could have let us know how long it would take or bring some bread out or something. We waited so long my kids got a stomach ache from being too hungry. My husband and I got headaches from the noise. When passing by the kitchen I only saw one person in there and there's a full house right now...  Prices are pretty high too. The food is definitely good, but it really isn't that big of a portion either. And there are many more restaurants with good food but not a whole hour wait. She told us there would be fiddleheads to come with each main but we never got that. And really small menu. I feel like the chefs effort in his dishes was wasted from the noise and customer service. It might be better on weekdays. But the waitress we had didn't seem really enthusiastic or anything, just basic \"how is it\" like two times."}
{"text":"Very busy on the weekend!  Small restaurant with limited choices, but the food was very reasonably priced and tasty.  There was about 3-4 on mains and appetizer to choose from.   I had the rolled crepe spinach soup, it's light tasty.  Shared the calamari and Brussels sprouts salad with friends... The calamari was very good.   The main was roasted Cornish hen with root veggies. This whole plate was amazing!!   Ended with lemon dacquoise ... It looks as appealing as it tastes :)  Would love to come back again for other menu items."}
{"text":"very tasty food. Been here for the past 3 years since I discovered it. Best restaurant in Markham. I always order the beef tenderloin with a seasonal appetizer. The sea scallops (if offered) are some of the best. Pricey however, but I roll straight up balla so it's no problem. Good service + good food = happy dyna."}
{"text":"Small hand written menu that changes frequently. Service was nice and friendly.  We shared an order of mushroom risotto (appetizer size), flavourful  Entrees: I had home made pasta with salmon pink sauce , pasta was delicious & decent portion of salmon. Hubby had cod fish served with mashed potatoes, green beans and broccoli; he thought it was great, I tried some and thought it was okay. I liked my pasta better. Desserts: I had lemon dacqouise (served with delicious home made lemon sauce and crushed almond & pistachio). Hubby had white chocolate cake served with strawberry sauce. Both desserts were good"}
{"text":"I decided to take my wife here for our 10th wedding anniversary after I checked Yelp for \"French\" near my area that isn't on Yonge Street.  When we first got here we found out the hard way that the place wasn't a French restaurant. However, it didn't really matter.  The food was good.  The place is run by the family, the dad cooks, the mom makes dessert and the son serves.  From what I remember, they were an Italian, but they cook food that tastes good and may be mistaken for other cuisines including French.  The place reminded me of those restaurants I saw in Brussels with the signpost outside.  Their special of the day by the time I got there was gone, but they had another special (slightly more expensive) that I took.  Pork Belly and scallops.  Reminded me of the time when I went for tapas at Winnipeg where I was satisfied with the flavors, the only exception was I wasn't hungry after eating.  Though I still had room for dessert  My wife ordered the Spaghetti and Bacon with mushrooms sans olives (we don't like olives).  She loved the texture of the pasta.  She also said the price she paid here was cheaper than Shiso Tree but she liked it better.  For me I like both.  There'd be times I would still like the okonomiyaki pasta at Shiso, but at least I can go here as well for other pasta.  We ended up sharing a dessert which I had to Google to get the right bloody spelling: dacquoise.  It was the first time I had a dessert like that, the fact that I don't even know how to spell it intrigued me to dare try it out.  Overall, the price is on the steep side for random food encounters, but for an anniversary dinner, it's a bargain."}
