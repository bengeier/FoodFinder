{"text":"Very good burger, very poor desert. Went there Sunday, the right burger to order is any of the giant ones, the regulars are really small. I'm a hungry guy...
Lots of fries though, and my wife loved the Curly shape thing, I think they are called Suzy Q fries?"}
{"text":"I just ate at this what appeared to be great restaurant. I am actually shocked right now to see the reviews it has gotten. Maybe the others who have wrote on this didn't have the same waitress that I had this morning... 
After going to the gym today I stopped by for brunch. I was greeted by a miserable old waitress... When it was time to order I asked her a simple question about a menu item and she for some reason became incredibly sarcastic and rude. In fact she tried to make me feel stupid as if I should have already known the answer to my question although I had never been here or even heard of this resto before. I simply asked her about the #3 breakfast that comes with a steerburger (let me add it was more of a steer meatball) and my meat choices for this because it came with several choices. I said is the steerburger 100% beef. She must have not understood sthg because she became aggressive, in my face rolling her eyes and said \"of course it's not all beef. It's bacon and sausage. It's made from pork. I said no I'm referring to the burger. She said well yeah it's beef.
They've been making beef burgers here since 1958. I know that by me explaining the situation here it doesn't sound nearly as bad as it was being in it because you would have had to see this woman and how rude she was. She made me feel like I should know sthg I didn't already know. Throughout the meal she didn't come to the table at all not even to tip up the coffee or ask if everything was okay. The restaurant was not busy at all during this time. I was so upset the entire meal with how we were treated that enjoying the meal was difficult. It was not at all an enjoyable experience. I'm actually happy she didn't come back to the table because I was ready to make a scene. I consider myself a really nice, polite and caring person and just could not believe this woman was serving people. When we asked for the bill I couldn't even look her in the face. She goes and brings our bills back to the table and had circled on our bills \"service not included\" as if we are stupid and didn't know this. Anyhow she knew what bad service had been given and we were not impressed. I then paid with my credit card and put in only 10% tip. She looks at me and says 10%!!!! I didn't respond. I wanted the hell out of there. When I have a chance I will be messaging personally the supervisor or owner of this restaurant. I dine out a couple times a week and even have a food blog. I can guarantee I will never return to this restaurant again nor anybody I know. Good service is just as important as the food and really the breakfast wasn't that great either. The burger was the size of a meatball and the so called hash browns are basically over cooked curly fries that are full of grease. I ate one and left the rest. 1 star is being generous! The meatball did have good flavour though"}
{"text":"Best burgers best hot dogs and everything here is great
Chec out my tip 
That is my review this time lol"}
{"text":"My! Oh my! Oh my! Mister Steer burger! This diner is an amazing place for an amazing tasty kosher meat burger! Different things to choose from however they are known for their burgers...I have to admit, you won't be too happy when you get the patty, it's like having a small meatball in a oversized bun but once you take a bite. It's mouthwatering. It's so juicy with so much flavor served with a side of curly fries and coleslaw. Its heavenly!

This restaurant is one of those old school diners with a bunch of senior but don't be turned away by the old decor just enjoy the trip back in time. I promise that you will go back for more. It's located on Sainte-Catherine's corner of Drummond."}
{"text":"Worst burger joint ever!
 Don't go near this trap!  The burgers were burnt and about the size of a dollar coin.  The curly fries were absolutely disgusting as they were cold and reheated.  Then there was the half chicken which came out to two portions of breasts because the legs were sold out.  Fine!  But at least make them tasty and fresh!  The chicken was absolutely DRY and tasted like it was a week old!  Sorry this place is a disaster!  Too bad it was our first meal in Montreal and it was certainly \"unforgettable!\""}
{"text":"Very good burgers and curly fries. Feels like an old diner of sorts. Friendly staff and quick service.  Burger and beer was around $24"}
{"text":"My flavour place for breakfast whenever I visit Montreal. Unbeatable grilled ham steak with nicely fried scramble eggs is always my number one choice. Staffs are friendly here as well."}
{"text":"Food is ok, the small burgers is really small. Unfortunately my meal was overcook (meat) and the fries was dry. Didn't had a great experience with the waitress as well. Didn't ask for drinks, made attitude when i told that it was overcook. I regret my choice, next time, I will go at the QDC burger instead, same price,  higher quality with excellent service."}
{"text":"Good food but service sucks: waitress apparently was in a rush, serving appetizers and burger plates at the same time... didn't ask for desert and brought the bill and the credit card machine all together... almost cleaning the table as we were sitting at the table. No smile, no care.... almost rude."}
{"text":"I discovered Mister Steer at about eight this morning as I wandered the streets around my hotel seeking an alternative to what would undoubtedly  be a twenty-five dollar Sheraton breakfast.  The happy-looking steer wearing a cowboy hat beckoned me and, always the sucker for an animal that knows that as long as it remains a successful logo, it won't end up on someone's plate, I stopped in.

Today was Mister Steer's lucky day.  Too early for burgers, I settled on a tasty diner breakfast: two pancakes, three strips of bacon (the pig wasn't so lucky), two eggs (those poor unborn chickens), potatoes, toast and coffee, all for about thirteen dollars, including the tip.  Not bad at all!  Also, I was in and out in about forty-five minutes, which left me with plenty of time for a last minute trip to Simon's before checking out and beginning the long drive back to Boston.

So, all you buckaroos and buckarettes, if you're looking for a diner that opens early, serves good food at a reasonable price with friendly, quick service, give Mister Steer a shot--but not literally, of course.

Yee haw!"}
{"text":"God damn their burgers are dry. Their hot dogs and fries were just bland. There are way better burgers and fries elsewhere in Montreal. Hell.. walk to Five Guys on the same street.

The only positive thing about this place is that it's open late and right next to a strip club.

It belongs on Crescent street with the rest of the tourist trap places."}
{"text":"Great tasting, good value breakfasts. Classic diner feel.  Some staff could be a little friendlier but I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Lorsque l'envie de dévorer un hamburger me prend, j'essaie d'éviter les gargantuesques corporations proposant des boulettes usinées à la tonne. Mister Steer est une excellente alternative pour ceux qui souhaitent redécouvrir le vrai goût d'un burger à l'américaine, et ça dure depuis plus de 50 ans. Quand la serveuse m'a demandé quel type de cuisson je désirais, j'ai compris que je n'étais pas dans une simple gargote à pelotes. Il y a un spécial chaque jour. Ça a bien tombé pour moi, car j'ai eu droit au spécial cheesburger, que j'ai commandé bien cuit. L'assiette est accompagnée d'un monticule de frites tourbillonnées (assez bonnes dans le ketchup) d'une salade et d'une boisson gazeuse (root beer forever). Le burger nous arrive pratiquement dénudé, sauf si l'on le veut avec tomate,  fromage et oignons. Le reste des condiments (moutarde, ketchup, relish, cornichons à volonté (!) et vinaigrette pour la salade) repose sur la table. L'on a qu'à doser à notre goût.

La boulette est particulièrement petite et faite en hauteur, ce qui donne un hamburger relativement surélevé et dépourvu sur les flancs (ça coule de partout!). N'empêche que la viande est fraîche, goûteuse et juteuse à souhait. L'on le mange dans une ambiance américaine, s'apparentant aux «diner» des années 50. Le restaurant est immense; se déploie à une telle profondeur que j'ai eu de la misère à voir le bout d'où j'étais assis. Mon assiette m'a coûté une dizaine de dollars, ce qui est pas mal pour la qualité du burger. Je ne suis pas prêts à dire que c'est le meilleur au monde (c'est leur slogan, pas le mien), mais en tout cas, une chose est certaine, ce fut au-delà de mes attentes. J'ai bien mangé et me suis sali comme un chef...

La Sleeman est la bière adoptée."}
{"text":"Mister Steer's is a surprisingly good place. Tucked between 2 strip clubs each with its own 'promoter' outside screaming at dudes to come in for 'a free try', you wouldn't think their food is outstanding. I always get the plate with 2 burgers (one with cheese and one with bacon). The meat is sort of ball-shaped and has a lot of flavour. Fries are good as well and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"My parents and I flew in from New York to visit Montreal. There was a gentleman outside the restaurant encouraging people to come in. At first, this gave the impression of a seedy restaurant. However, once inside we found Mister Steer to be an old-fashioned style diner. The restaurant had delicious hamburgers (with small patties) and suzy Q fries. The fried fish and chips (fries) were cooked well also. Very crispy and flavorful. We also tried poutine for the first time in Mister Steer.

The waiting staff was very nice and accomodating as well. Mister is a good go-to spot for lunch and/or dinner."}
{"text":"Would give it four stars, but it is perhaps a tad pricey?

The little burgers are packed with flavor, this is quality beef and not your frozxen run of the mill burger patty.

Fries are small, curly, crunchy and made of what dreams are made of. Seriously some of the best fries i've eaten"}
{"text":"Steer Burger cooked medium rare is the besssstest thing on the menu... I don't usually like eating burgers but this one wassss AMAZZZZZING AND JUICY JUICY JUICY. By far the most tasty I have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Je connais ce restaurant depuis ci longtemps. Pour les amateurs de viande, vous serez servis! Le Steerburger est succulant et que dire du Suzie Q! Le restaurent à été rénové depuis peu et offre beaucoup plus de places assises qu'auparavant. Vous mangerez comme un roi et le tout à un prix modique. Le service est super et rapide et l'ambiance est décontractée. L'essayer c'est l'adopter!

I know this restaurant for so long. For meat lovers, you will be served! The Steerburger is succulent and what about Suzie Q! The restaurant was renovated recently and offers many more seats than before. You eat like a king and all at a low price. The service is great and fast and the atmosphere is casual. Try it and adopt it!"}
{"text":"Good service. Good burgers. Crap fries (Susie Q) and overpriced, non-refill pop. Good if you have a few drinks in you already, but otherwise I spent the time waiting for my food noting the dust and grime build-up. 

Bathrooms are very clean!"}
{"text":"Restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is great and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Its my go-to place before concerts/hockey games given its proximity to the Bell Centre, quick service and good burgers at fair prices.

The decor is very 70s diner and its situated between two strip clubs....all part of its charm!

As soon as you are seated you get a green salad - condiments are on the table and your choices are limited to orange (french?) dressing or oil and vinegar....again, part of its charm!

The burgers are meatball style - small, thick and served pink and spiced with \"Suzy Q\" curly fries. Burgers are small but filling and your plate will abound with fries!

Everything is decent, filling diner fare...and even, on the busiest of nights, you can be in and out in under an hour."}
{"text":"A staple anytime I'm in Montreal. Burgers look small in picture but they are definitely thick! Great fries too! Must visit."}
{"text":"They get and extra star because we were starving, and there were plenty of tables.  

The food is standard dinner fare.  We all had breakfast, which was good. 

The service was not great.  It may have just been our waitress, but she was in no rush to help us at all."}
{"text":"Nice little diner. We were looking for a good breakfast and hit the spot.  Didn't try the burger but everyone raved about them."}
{"text":"Ended up here because the place we were planning on was packed, and we were getting seriously hangry after a long plane ride and rush hour taxi ride into town. 

So, the burgers. I admit, I was a little scared when they arrived. The patties are the softball type - much smaller diameter then the bun, and very thick, which is not my preferred style. But, it turned out to be pretty tasty. The meat had a good char on it, and was well seasoned. After the first couple of bites, the patty squishes out to the edges, so you don't have that thing where you're left with a bunch of plain white bread at the end. They were also generous with the bacon on the bacon cheeseburger. 

I liked that the burgers came with both salad and a side. The fries were disappointing, though- underfried, so soggy and a little greasy. 

All in all I was happy with the meal. The burger was surprisingly good, but points off for the soggy fries and the pricing, which I thought was a little high for what you get."}
{"text":"I LOVE steak and shake and this is definitely the steak and shake of Montreal.  The bright lights and signs that covered the outside of this place are so Hilarious....all I saw was a large cow head with a big cowboy hat and all I could do was laugh my ass off.  So if what they were going for was attention they had my all!

When you walk inside it's like there's a giant hall filled with a long bar with stools that you can sit and eat at.  We opted for the booth style table and were happy to sit and warm up.  

We both ordered the cheese burger and  salad then after had dessert.  I ordered the brownie with ice cream.  The burger was delicious and not flat like the good old steak and shake burgers but rather was more like something you would make at home.  It tasted good, no complaints there and had little to no grease as well.  It comes with a salad (nothing special, but perfectly sized), and their fries that are much like curly fries but shorter.

The brownie was the perfect end to the meal and I was way too full to come close to finishing it.  

So, don't knock the cow with the hat until you try it!"}
{"text":"A decent hamburger joint, you probably won't have a bad meal but you won't be amazed.  They serve you a small salad when you sit down and the soft drinks come in frosty mugs."}
{"text":"Epicurious my beloved  brought me here, this place in its self is a blast from the past! I feel 5 again only thing that's missing is bell bottom pants and tobacco Adidas shoes it Great place to take a load off and have a decent burger odd burger cause of its ball shape but whatever its a burger and they grill'em well or medium as well .. oh and the fries with a side order of mayo your in diner heaven .."}
{"text":"All burgers are not created equal... and Mister Steer's is on the mediocre side, which is why I don't understand what all the fuss and rage is about.  I really wanted to like this place, but the food didn't do it for me :("}
{"text":"Je suis arrivé dans ce restaurant seulement car j'etais curieux ! Finalement jai ete bien surpris ! C'est un petit restaurant sans pretention qui fait de tres bon burger ! 

J'ai mangé le burger hero ! Une boulette d'une demi livre pour 14$ avec des oignons caramelisé et du bacon ! Un regal !


De plus les frites sont excellente et le service aussi :)"}
{"text":"We found this place having lost patience with Cora's. What a gem! A nice mix of old world American diner and Montreal ambience. It serves all day, but we only experienced the breakfast menu on the two days we visited. Wholesome, simple fare, with unlimited coffee all at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Interesting little meal. This place is supposed to have the best burgers in Montreal. Ummm.. eh?

I got the #7 which included a hotdog (on a burger roll) and a little burger. The hot dog was tasty, the burger was OK. It came with a salad but the only options were using the oil & vinegar on the table. I love oil & vinegar so that was a-ok for me. 

I'm guessing this was kind of a tourist trap, as my meal was $14, a little steep for the diner-esque cuisine. They give you a little jar of pickles though, (for your burger) and I love pickles so I totally ate half the jar. 

Overall, it's a pretty cheap eat (for the area) and only around the corner from the Sheraton where I'm staying."}
{"text":"hoooooooooo my gooooooooooooood this is the best burger ever eat and burgers i've ever eaten"}
{"text":"Best Burger and Fries I've ever had.  Good top quality beef in the burgers and curly fries.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Happy to see the management was keeping an eye on things - hopefully it is this good without the management present. Highly recommend for a great burger!!"}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment. We went with a family of seven. The older gentleman that was greeting was on the cranky side from the start.  We waited forever for the waitress to greet us. She was very friendly when we saw her. But it was infrequent bs SLOW which was probably due to the constant drama between the staff. The waitresses were fighting constantly and then talking about each other. At one point one woman approached another that was prepping salads and demanded that she treat her like a human being. 
The food was mediocre. Coleslaw was served out of a plastic tub. Burgers were definitely not up to their \"world famous\" claim. There were no free refills on soda and the kids ended up with a $23 dollars charge on the bill just for drinks. The food was way overpriced. $13-$15 for a meal that should be priced at $8-$10. It turned out to be a $150 crappy and extremely slow lunch. No thanks! We will never go back there or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Mister Steer's burgers, just never knew what all the hype was about until I tried it. I've eaten there a few times now and really enjoy their super supreme burger with their yummy Suzie Q's!

It's a very homey-like diner, simple and straight forward. Good and friendly service every single time! I haven't explored much of their menu, but when I'm craving a good burger for a good price, it's usually in my list of options!"}
{"text":"Mister Steer to this day remains my favorite and best burger in Montreal (IMO) best bet to enjoy one of these burgers is at home on the bbq. Pick up some hot fries and some meat to cook on the BBQ and you're good to go! Unfortunately, the past 2 experiences in the restaurant have been completely terrible and embarrassing for this restaurant to say the least. On my past visits, waitresses have been less than attentive. Needing to ask them for water, asking for condiments and we were never asked if we needed anything. The restaurant was empty on both occasions (probably 15-20 people) and the food took over 40 minutes to arrive for burgers! Ridiculous! And at the end of the meal, without previous disclosure, the restaurant includes an 18% mandatory tip which was absurd for the service we received. The servers definitely need training and some more experience. While the restaurants renovations and aesthetically is quite nice, the service ruins it all. If you want to enjoy a famous steerburger, better do it at home!"}
{"text":"I can always count on Mister Steer for a delicious burger. The burgers here are not huge, but they are filling, and what lack in size they more than make up for with really tasty and juicy meat. The Suzy-Q fries are shoestring style and soft, so if you'r expecting regular fries you won't be happy, but personally, I like skinny fries so it works for me.  They always serve a small salad before the Steerburger and it's actually pretty nice and crisp. The atmosphere is old timey diner and I like it.

The Steerburger with fries never lets me down, the prices are reasonable, and the service is very quick. I always try to stop in here at least once whenever I visit home and have always left with a happy tummy . A win for me, whether the Habs are playing or not!"}
{"text":"Was visiting town and against my better judgement went to this place. I went early afternoon and the place was pretty much empty. The waitress provided pretty poor service and seemed disinterested in helping me considering I was flying solo. The food was decent though I didn't get a burger which is what they are supposedly known for. With all the great places to eat in Montreal,  not to mention right around this place I wouldn't return. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. 

I got wings and cheese sticks FWIW. Not great value the chicken wings were very small like from a midget chicken or something or a deformed one. The cheese sticks weren't awful but overpriced. They also served it with ice cold marinara sauce which is banana land.

Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"In the mood for a burger and curly fries?  Come on over!  

Retro looking diner with lots of room and a lot of variety if you want chicken or an old fashioned tuna salad sandwich.

Me... Mister Cheeseburger, curly fries, and a vanilla shake.

Thick shake was satisfying.  Burger cooked medium exactly as I asked with a secret spice that makes it extra delish.  Generous mound of curly fries.  Hit the spot after a day spent walking through Montreal.

Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Staying at a fancy hotel in the area, there was no way we were paying thirty dollars a person for breakfast in their lobby serving some stale banquet food buffet. So we took a quick walk down Saint Catherine and visited Mister Steer. Eggs, oatmeal, breakfast meats, Montreal bagels, local tomatoes, crisp toast, fresh fruit and high octane coffee served quickly and cheaply with a smile in a no nonsense atmosphere with well-maintained 1950's booths and tables. And don't forget s side order of those Suzie Q potatoes. Unforgettable."}
{"text":"This became my favourite restaurant in the 3 days we stayed in Canada. Literally came here for breakfast every morning and sometimes lunch. Our waitress was amazing. Unlike the U.S, I love that they have a hook to hang your jacket right at your table. They have so many food options! You have to try the suzie Q fries with the \"orange sauce\". The burgers are great, juicy and made to order! They are small but the taste makes up fog it. Probably should order 2 burgers if you are a hearty eater"}
{"text":"I went into Reuben's at around 8:45 in the morning hoping to get a smoked meat sandwich.  They said they don't serve it until at least 10.  I said \"I'll be back\" because I didn't want to have eggs from Reuben's.  

So I just decided to walk down St. Catherine street to see what was there.  I saw a cool looking cow and they had a great selection of breakfast items, checked a few Yelp reviews and then ventured on in.

Likes:
-Service was friendly
-The Steerburger special is amazing. It's a small, but very good quality beef patty  (good enough that they ask how you want it - I said medium), bacon or ham or sausage, eggs, shoestring fries, toast and coffee for $9.85
-The coffee has free refills
-The Steerburger was very good and despite it being cooked medium, it was still moist.  
-The shoestring fries were AMAZING!! I loved these so much. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  

Dislikes: 
-None really but could be slightly cleaner.  I was going to sit at one booth near the outside but saw the seat was a bit dusty so I decided to find a new one. Not a huge deal though.  

Like or Dislikes depending on your preference:
-It's an old diner look but it adds to the fun of the place, IMO. 

Verdict: This is a great place for breakfast and much cheaper than Chez Cora.  Should try it out. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"The shared space between the meat and the gluten is melodramatically flawed. It's a gingerly squished meatball, resting on a sizable bun. The burger is as Lucy; very juicy!"}
{"text":"Mr. Steer a complété récemment une rénovation et bien que l'endroit fait un peu moins vieillot, l'esprit de l'endroit a été conservé. Les choses qui ont changées ont plus à voir avec les condiments à table qui ne sont plus dans des petits pots mais dans des bouteilles commerciales. Aussi, plus de pot de cornichons, il faut le demander.

Autrement, les prix sont toujours aussi intéressants et les burgers, frites et salade aussi bonnes. Le service est toujours rapide et courtois... en fait il y avait une vieille madame qui avait de la difficulté à commander et la serveuse a fait preuve d'une patience et d'une gentillesse exceptionnelles!

Mr. Steer n'est pas un gastro-pub, mais un endroit authentique pour une expérience sympathique et du \"comfort food\" dans la plus pure tradition!"}
{"text":"Tried suzie Q, it's pretty nice. A decent bagel breakfast with coffee."}
{"text":"Aye fam, this place is legit. Best hamburgers in downtown Montreal. The great pricing helps too. Aye, they have curly fries. French fries are for basics. Legit. I definitely recommend this place to anyone whose cruising around downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"We've been to this spot twice; once for lunch and today for breakfast.  The lunch was great and they do have incredible burgers that taste like a sirloin steak grilled and charred to perfection. Today we had breakfast and it was excellent!  The over easy eggs were the bomb and perfectly cooked. The service is top-notch and having waitressed myself this is a huge compliment.  My hubbie had the breakfast combo that included our loved steer burger (no bun) and it was just as excellent as it is at lunch. Great place!"}
{"text":"The steerburger is a decent burger, but not amazing. The patty is nice but the bun is on the cheaper end of burger bun quality and the toppings are adequate but unremarkable. The Suzy-Q fries are great. Service during weekday lunch was reasonable although it was semi-busy. Oddly enough the place is a teensy bit more dingy than my photos make it seem. It has a certain charm, but not really somewhere I'd bring mom or a date. A good place for a casual burger but not something I'd go out of the way for. Still, I'd revisit if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Very good burgers. Juicy and tasty.  Will cook it your way. I picked medium and enjoyed it thoroughly."}
{"text":"Incredible burgers
Long time tradition
I come here 2-3 times a year
Great friendly service!
Just waiting for my apple pie with ice cream !
And TGIF !"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been to this place and I don't know what it's like now but I always enjoyed coming here all my years of being a starving student or just starting my career in an entry-level position and wage.

They are know for giving you a salad with French dressing as soon as you enter.

They are also always celebrating some kind of anniversary and I swear it is not in any particular order (one year it is their 52nd anniversary and then it's the 49th anniversary the year after).

I usually go for their burger or their burger and quarter rotisserie chicken combo called \"la compagnie\". Each comes with their signature curly shoestring \"Suzy Q\" fries which are cut fresh in store and are always delicious.

The burgers are adequately sized and always juicy and delicious and their rotisserie chicken matches that of Swiss Chalet.

From reading other reviews, they have renovated in the past couple of years but I do recall the place from when I used to go as a 60's-style ambience.

Service is always friendly and you don't have to wait long for your food so it's great if you're in a rush... after all, it is located in the heart of Sainte-Catherine Street!

** I plan to go back this year so if the quality is still the same, this rating could be improved."}
{"text":"My grandmother used to work here, back in the days! Still has that old-fashioned diner vibe! Great burgers, done to your preference. With a side of Suzie-Q curly fries and coleslaw... you're back to \"Happy Days\"... Pop in, you'll be quickly served and on to greater things out on Saint-Catherine street!"}
{"text":"Fairly standard burger and fries joint with no frills to other. Proceeded to follow my friends and go there for lunch after we drove up from Boston. Don't ask me why exactly we went there but we were famished, it was close and we just went with it. No point in arguing and trying to spend time trying to find something else when you're both tired and hungry.

All five of us were sat at two adjacent booths and after glancing at their wide selection of burgers, we Americans decided to go ahead and order a bunch. In my case, I had a simple cheese burger, which came with a side-salad and some Suzy-Qs fries, which essentially are curly fries which have a light seasoning on them.

Everything came out reasonably quickly from the kitchen and the burger was cooked perfectly and was somewhat juicy. The fries on the other hand weren't that great and the salad... well... was a fairly standard salad.

I walked in not expecting much and got exactly that. My experience there was decent and the service was efficient, although not that friendly. Seems to me like this place is a tourist trap, especially since it's on St. Catherine's Street. The place was clean, the menu had a wide variety of items and the only catch is that it was cash-only which was kind of annoying, especially since it's 2011. 

With many more places to eat in the area, I'd stay away from this place as there's much better around, except if you want a burger in which case they do a pretty decent job. After all, they've been in business for over two decades so they definitely can cook their menu well. But it definitely lacked excitement and their menu had nothing local in it. A real shame."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, but definitely wasn't the best. Small sandwich and soggy fries made this meal less than amazing.  Waitress was nice and attentive, but go elsewhere if you can."}
{"text":"Mister steer, sometimes confused with Steerburger, but sadly not in the same league. It's not a bad restaurant, it's just overrated. I like the fact that its a bit of a neighborhood favorite, but they do not make a memorable burger. I wouldn't avoid returning, I just won't make it a destination."}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the only places I can get a medium rare burger, and they do it right. The fires are really good and the wait is minimal. Anytime I come back to Montreal, i always stop here. I haven't tried anything else because that burger is addictive!"}
{"text":"Do one thing at this institution:  order the strawberry shortcake.  It's pricy but it's a monstrous good old fashioned smile-maker.  My son had the most shit-eating grin I've ever seen on his face when the waitress smashed it down in front of him and said:  Good Luck brave man.  And then she gave me a wink and a spoon.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Somehow this is the best American style food I've ever had.  I know that seems strange since I was in Canada!

It was late in the evening and a friend and I were walking down Sainte-Catherine and we needed a bite to eat.  It was pretty late so we weren't sure what we would be able to find.  After walking around taking photos in the cold wet weather, a warm, comfortable place to eat had clearly made it to the top of the agenda.  When we came across Mister Steer tucked between two strip clubs, we decided to go for it.

The food was both good and fast with friendly service.  How fast was the service?  Well, I went to the washroom right after I ordered and when I came back the whole meal was already there!  Granted, it was late so they weren't that busy, but I have never had food come out that fast before.
  
The hamburger was very tasty and well seasoned.  It also came as a round lump, not flat, somewhat like it would if you made it at home.  The curly fries were okay, and it was nice to have a little side salad with the meal. For dessert I had hot apple pie a la mode.  It wasn't the best apple pie I've ever had, but it was still a very good dessert.

This place is the perfect spot for a home style meal on a cold day."}
{"text":"We were tired of our free hotel breakfast, so decided to check this place out.  The food is plentiful and cheap, and quite good.  

I had a combo with eggs, toast, a pancake, ham, and fries.  Good Lord.  I couldn't finish it, but it was all very good, some of the best diner food I've had."}
{"text":"I went to this place because it is close to my hotel.

I ordered a quarter pound burger, curly fries and a vanilla milk shake.  The burger was very good, but the fries were very disappointing.  They were lukewarm, soft and flat as if they sat on the side for a long time waiting to be served.  The shake was just ok.

As for service, it was ok as well."}
{"text":"Came back to Mister Steer once again, and the service was sub-par. Food was still great though. The bad experience could have been a fluke as they are often very good"}
{"text":"After walking around for a place to eat, we found the only only burger joint in the heart of downtown montreal to eat at.  There were only Mediterranean or  Asian restaurants as well as many bars, and as we were passing, the man was outside trying to get people to try their restaurant. He said it's pure beef, not like other places that mix it with animal products, so we decided to give it a try:

Hero burger - 2 1/2 stars - would have been 4 if they hadn't burnt it. We ordered well done, but my poor son had it charred.  For more than $17, he got a regular charred sized burger with lots of fries.  I think just ordering without fries is more worth it if all the other servings are with fries.

Combo chicken and burger with fries - 3 1/2 stars - again, I think they are trying to compensate for the price by giving a huge mound of fries. We ordered medium well, and it was a little  burnt, but ok, at least not as charred as the hero burger. The burger was excellent,  but the chicken was a bit burnt and dry.

Poutine with ground meat - 4 stars - first time eating poutine, but after trying other poutine at other places, I like this one the best. I think it's their gravy, cheese and meat mix that makes their poutine the best.

Steak - 3 stars - for $30, the steak was thin, but chewy.  I can grill better steak than what we got, but it was ok.

Salad - just basic - lettuce with strips of carrots.

Coleslaw - 3 stars - pretty good, ok.

Service - 4 stars - the waitress was nice and patient. We got to sit by the window to look outside and acclimate ourselves to the area."}
{"text":"Burger was extremely tasty! I just had the 1/4 lb steerbuger w/ cheese.

Cole Slaw EXCELLENT!

Great baked beans!

Nice salad!

Fries are great!

Wonderful staff!

Really enjoyed it! :) :)"}
{"text":"Mister Steer is a Montreal institution. Once voted to have the best burgers in Montreal . The interior has a dated 70's diner feel to it. 

Once you are seated - be prepared to get a green salad. There's no way to say no to it. The waitress will serve it to you immediately (I see the salad as a good introduction to the grease that's about to come...) and you have only 1 choice of dressing: French (never asked if you can have ranch..)

Mr. Steer is known for their ball burgers. What I mean by this is that the meat is not shaped into a flat patty - but rather a ball. It cooks nice and evenly on the outside. The only way to order a burger here is medium - anything else and you are loosing out on the flavour. 

Another great item here are the Suzie Q fries. These are curly fries that you can get with your burger. The fries are a hit or miss. Sometimes they are served nice and crispy, other times they are warm and taste like they have been waiting for my burger under a hot-lamp. 

If you are visiting - make a point to stop off here. It's a downtown landmark. If you are a local and have never been, what's stopping you?"}
{"text":"Love this independent old school diner right downtown on St Catherine's street! It's been lovingly maintained, the staff is wonderful: last week I had this classic, quick, kind professional waitress, the kind that makes you feel like they've been taking good care of people for a long time and you're in good hands. 

The burger is pretty rare even if you ask for medium, that's just how it goes here, so if you're worried about that then ask for well. But you can trust that the meat is fresh, as is the bun and veggies. And the curly fries are tasty. And you can grab a cold beer and an amazing meal and watch the city pour by."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick dinner. Ordered the #10 Super Supreme Burger with cheese, bacon, tomatoes, onion rings, and fries. Burger was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Fries were a bit greasy but you can taste the Yukon gold potatoes. Onion rings tasted like the cheap frozen stuff you can buy at the supermarket. Comes with a bowl of lettuce and carrot strings they call a side salad. Décor and feel is old school diner. Servers friendly and attentive. If you want a great burger and only a burger, definitely check this place out. Chicken sandwiches also look pretty good. If you want fries I suggest you ask to make sure they aren't greasy."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch here before the Alouette's game with my father in law as he was mentioning he has eaten here for 35 years! We ordered rootbeers and ordered lunch and it was out (no joke) 2 min later.  Good quality non greasy burger with curly fries.  I had a cheeseburger and fries and they brought out a nice salad before. So funny the choices of salad dressing are French (which they leave on the table or oil and vinegar, on the table as well). There is a sign on the wall been there since 1958! My father in law had the two small mr steer burgers. They ask how you want cooked. I chose mine medium. My FIL had his well done.  Very reasonable and comfort diner food! Would be great with a family or as a late night or early morning after bar food!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, with its highly-reviewed American food and cute signature steer. Unfortunately, the service was sub-par. First of all, service was slow and aloof. They were out of the nightly special (Fish & Chips), but we didn't find this out until five minutes after we ordered. Then, we had to practically hunt down the server to re-order and remind her that we were still waiting for our drinks (this is at least 20 minutes after we arrived). Contrary to the previous reviews, I didn't think the fries were as great as people said they were. The burger was OK but I've had much better for a cheaper price, nothing amazing here. And apparently you're supposed to get your soft drink in a frosty mug? Nope - more a tiny glass with a few cubes of ice (plus no refill offered when I finished it quickly). I know this place is low-key and I know the demands of working in a busy restaurant but come on.... service counts!"}
{"text":"Mr. Steers. Not the regular burger. Not the greasy, sloppy burger, not a burger made of chuck either, but made of steak. Makes for a different tasty burger served as a ball instead of a patty with crispy bacon and Susy-Q fries to die for AND they have black cherry cola. SOLD. 

This place has been around for decades and I've been going for over 20 years. Definitely worth the stop. Not cheap but for a different take on the usual burger, go for it."}
{"text":"If I had a buck every time someone mentioned their fries, this lunch would have paid for itself. This is a straight-forward 50's inspired diner. Nothing more, nothing less. Surprisingly, the place was pretty empty at lunch hour and I was assigned my own table near the back of the place. I had a cheeseburger, which was large and filling, but..nothing earth-shattering. Full disclosure: I'm not a burger connoiseur. The bread was regular store-bought bread, and the patty was.. round? How do I deal with that? The helping of Suzy Q. fries was generous, but they were soggy! Meh."}
{"text":"Mr.Steers has always been one of my favourite burger spots in Montreal. It's a dinner style restaurant in the heart of the downtown core of Montreal. It boasts in my opinion, one of the best burgers in the city. The restaurant has recently gone through some changes, giving it a more modern interior. Somethings, like its menu however have thankfully stayed the same. They still serve a complimentary little salad before your meal, and their Suzie Q fries are always tasty and served generously. However certain things have changed for the worse over the last couple years at Mister Steers. It's burger size has shrunken, while its prices have risen, perhaps to pay for the new interior, who knows, nonetheless, for those of us who knew what a Mister steers burger was like five or ten years ago, the new reality comes as a disappointing shock. Also the service which has never been very good, is still not very good. As a final verdict, I'd say that you should go there if you're looking for a unique old school burger experience, also please do not order the fish, made that mistake once, vowed to never make it again"}
{"text":"Well, this was kind of disappointing ...

We stopped by for breakfast since we walked past this place and it seemed good on the surface.  We also didn't want to have anything elaborate that morning so we opted for this local quick fix/diner place.  

The place was pretty empty at around 8am and we were able to get a decent seat.  Given it was Labor Day morning so they were pretty lean in terms of staffing and we found out there was only one cook at the time.  Unsurprisingly the food took awhile but that was fine.  

The breakfast platter I got was mediocre at best.  What killed me was how the eggs were a mess ... it's hard to mess up scrambled eggs lol.  Even I could have jammed it out better.  The bacon was also burnt.  

However, I did also try their pancakes and they were fine.  Gotta love Canadian maple syrup to save the day!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant It's my first time in Montreal and in Canada in general and my sister took me to this restaurant for lunch today. Excellent food and great service!!"}
{"text":"J'ai été pour la première fois depuis plusieurs (trop) d'années et je ne comprends toujours pas pourquoi que je n'ai jamais été depuis. Le restaurant de son apparence est très ordinaire. Le service est très courtois. La raison de mes quatre étoiles...c'est le burger. C'est tous simplement le meilleur que j'ai mangé de ma vie (sans exagération). Ce restaurant ,qui fêtera ses 55e années de service très bientôt, on la meilleure viande que l'on peut trouver dans un burger à Montréal. Je n'ai pas essayé les autres plats, les burgers sont tous simplement formidable et les frites \"Suzie-Q\" sont aussi excellentes."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of downtown Montreal, this place is a refuge for hungry diners - tourists and locals alike. We got to Montreal late, and we were all starving. With 12 other people in the group who were not into food adventure, we picked Mister Steer as a safe option to feed us. The manager was friendly as well as the wait staff. Our server was excellent, and boy she was a trooper. She served many tables with a smile - this place could benefit from more servers. 

My food came hot and well-prepared. I had the Super Supreme burger which came with a juicy patty in a right amount size of buns. The burger is a bit smaller than other burgers, but since it comes with their legendary fries, coleslaw and crispy onion rings, I am pretty sure no one would complain about its size. The coleslaw was not the best, but the fries. OMG. These fries. I need these fries in Toronto. I threw out my diet and finished all of it, because, vacation! 

Back to the burger. Like any decent burger place, you can ask them to cook it to your liking; mine was medium well. It came medium well, thus the juiciness. 

The ambience is casual like a family-style pub. It's unpretentious and unassuming."}
{"text":"Often lauded as a Montreal institution MIster Steer is serving up hamburgers in a old-school diner setting in Montreal.  They have supposedly been voted one of the best burgers in Montreal six years in a row.  The menu is varied so you will find something to eat even if you are not in the mood for a burger.

As Mister Steer is known for its burgers it made sense to get a bacon cheeseburger.  Mister Steer burgers have very thick patties.  The burger as a whole is decent but not mind-blowing.  While the patty is really juicy the bun they use is kind of cheap and not much better than what you find at the grocery store.  It can be accompanied by Suzie Q fries if you so desire.  I must admit that the fries are a little disappointing.  They were soggy and bland.  Sure you can add salt to make up for the lack of flavour but you can't do anything about the sogginess.  This cost me about $15-$16 which is fair for downtown.

I must have been here on an off-night because on my recent visit the service wasn't as good as some other reviewers are suggesting.  It was slow and at times it felt like our server had forgotten our table. There was definitely room for improvement in this area.

Mister Steer didn't seem to live up to the hype.  While it wasn't terrible it also wasn't amazing.  It would be the kind of place that I would come to if I happened to be nearby and really hungry, however I wouldn't make an effort for it."}
{"text":"I love diners, the vibe, the food, the comfortability. We walked into Mister Steer expecting classic diner food, a satisfying meal of fried foods and milkshakes. We didn't get to make it to the milkshakes, as the discovery of my friend's fish and chips being raw made her vomit in the bathroom. My other friend, who also ordered the fish and chips, consequently threw up when we got back home. I understand that sometimes things happen and this could have been a fluke, but everything else we had was also gross and incredibly overpriced. 
A dry, cardboard veggie burger with a single tomato and a few rings of red onion for $15? A side of pre-packaged guacamole for an extra $3? Six mozzarella sticks for $8? This is diner food, and yet my boyfriend and I left with a $45 tab. 
The only redeeming quality was the obviously sympathetic waitress who tried her best to accommodate us, but I still think our experience at this establishment was one of the worst I've had at any diner, or any restaurant in general."}
{"text":"I like Mister Steer. That's all there is to say about this restaurant. 

It's good. It's not life changing, it's not amazing, it's not the best burger you've ever had, it's that place that you go to sometimes when you don't really know where you want to eat and you're just like \"huh... ok, Mister Steer\"

The curly fries are good. I don't recall any special sauces or anything to go with them. 

The decor is 50s diner style. It's usually pretty busy for lunch.

Expect decent."}
{"text":"Mister Steer has lots of seating and reasonable prices. The food is okay - I had a western omelette. However, the service is horrible. I waited for about 30-40 minutes for my order when folks around me were getting served. When they finally brought my order, it didn't have the side dish that I had asked for. The server was friendly, but clearly over her head even though the restaurant wasn't full and they had help."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhhhhh ! Mister Steer
Je dois cette découverte à un collègue et ami, amateur de Hockey, Tony. Une trouvaille que je fréquente à chacune de nos sorties au Hockey des Canadiens. Un MUST évident à Montréal, une institution du hamburger depuis 50 ans ! C'est pas n'importe quoi ! Actuellement, ils sont fermés pour travaux. Nous attendons leur retour avec impatience. Burger, frites torsadées, .... des quantités rassasiantes ........ quel bonheur.

Ahhhhhhhhhh ! Mister Steer
I owe this find to one of my colleagues and friend, hockey lover Tony. I frequently stop by whenever I have a Canadians game at Bell Center. It's a MUST evidently, in Montreal, has been for 50 years ! That's not anything. Right now, they are going under works. We will wait for their return. Burgers, twist fries, .... filling quantities ........ happiness."}
{"text":"That's A Good Burger.


   Mister Steer is another Montreal experience. If you walk in at 6:30 on a Habs game night, you will be backhanded with some of Montreal's finest diner ambiance and hustle n' bustle.

  To keep up with the Jones', they have made additions to the original menu but in the spirit of being a Montreal purist, I just get the special.

  The Suzy Q Fries. The fries are...in a word, ethereal.... Shoestringish, crispy on the ends with a little sogginess in the middle, a damn good french fry.

  If you are in town and have Habs tickets, do yourself a favour and get a burger here prior to game time. You'll get a great taste of the city and save a gagillion dollars at the concession stands.

Go Habs!

{"text":"Je n'en reviens pas! Je n'ai pas encore écrit d'avis à propos de Mr. Steer! Pour un vrai de vrai burger dans un resto à l'ambiance de style \"diner\" le Mr. Steer est incontournable. C'est rien de trop compliqué mais quelques petits détails comme la possibilité d'avoir des oignons frits (au lieu de cru) pour si peu que 50 cents et les populaires frites Suzie Q rendent cet endroit un peu plus spécial que bien d'autres. Le menu n'inclut pas que des burgers, mais bon, c'est vraiment la spécialité de la place donc je n'ai jamais rien commandé d'autre que ça. Avant votre plat principal, on vous emmène une petite salade maison (laitue iceberg, tomates, carottes et vinaigrette française) qui permet de patienter un peu et surtout, de manger les légumes de la journée! Ils ont aussi un permis d'alcool donc vous pourrez rincer votre burger avec une bonne bière froide."}

{"text":"Heard great reviews but it was just okay.  Loved our server bit atmosphere was lacking."}
{"text":"In Montreal on business and asked for a recommendation for a burger place downtown. 

I have to say I was disappointed. While the burger was ok, it was nothing special.

The fries were soggy, and couple of onion rings that came with the burger were over cooked.

A very \"meh\"experience.

I wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"Oh Mister Steers, how I miss you so.

Favorite burger joint in Montreal. Don't expect it to be classy - it's got that old school diner feel, including the dirt from all those years ago. 

The service isn't the friendliest, promptest or most accommodating... also expect them to be mainly versed in French with minimal English abilities - can be frustrating, welcome to Quebec.

I love Steer burgers, my Suzie Q fries and my french dressing on the complimentary salad. 

I usually the get the 6 plus - 2 burgers, and I add double cheese, double bacon (to adequately cover both burgers) - I never understood why this was not the standard 6 plus, but I digress. 

Just amazing... these little burgers might look little and slightly resemble hockey pucks, which I know we're in Canada, so I wouldn't be surprised if some tourists got confused, but hey, they sure pack a punch and are quite dense! One bit in and you get that full-feeling... they really are packed in nice and tight.

They're kosher which is a cool thing to promote and you can even take home a couple to throw on your own BBQ (they don't taste as good, sorry!).

This place has incredible turn over and packs in people on a Habs game night. 

Solid burger. Solid burger joint. Try it, it's practically a Montreal institution!"}
