{"text":"Hot Box pizza has an outstanding order and delivery experience.  The food is great.  I would highly recommend this for delivery to Bethel Park -- they are very fast and very friendly.  I sent a customer e-mail to the support page about an issue I had with their website and I was pleasantly astonished to have received a personal response.  This company has an exceptional customer service philosophy.  Excellent wings - hard to find good ones around Bethel Park."}
{"text":"I think I had about the worst hoagie/sub/etc... that i have ever had from this place.  I used a coupon, i often wonder if that causes shops to prepare different food.  Anyway,  I had a buy 1 , get 1 free coupon,  so i ordered a steak and Italian sub.  When i picked it up , they came in a Styrofoam container which made me question the quality, but i figured i would taste it before passing judgement.  After opening the container, my expectations only plummeted further - the steak hoagie contained mayo in a tube, and the \"Italian\"  sub contained a tube of Italian dressing.  As i bit into each of the subs, I only became more dis-enchanted,  they were the absolute worst subs i have ever had - subway included.   I  will obviously never order here again,  and would not be interested in trying anything else unless it was free.  Google would not allow me to post Zero stars,  but if i could , i would."}
{"text":"We order from here frequently! The food is always good. The steak hoagie is a good go to! We usually get pizza and wings. Delivery is usually quick, take out is always ready quick, and food is always hot when it arrives! The shop is very small but good food. 

Tonight we got the Monday takeout special of a large cheese pizza for $7 with light sauce. Very good, hot, and cheesy!! We also got 2 dozen wings. We got mild buffalo and sweet and tangy bbq. The wings are always crisp when they arrive and very meaty!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why my boyfriend and I continuously give this place chances. Last time we ordered they sent our supreme pizza cold and without green peppers. The food is awful and greasy. They barely put any bacon on the overpriced \"loaded\" fries. They cover them in jalape√±os. The ranch, or any other dipping sauce you have to pay extra for and it comes in a small pouch that is hot from sitting with the food.

We will not order from here anymore. YaYas here we come!"}
{"text":"We ordered and it took well over an hour to get 2.5 miles away. Regardless of how good it may or may not be, we will never order again. And by the way, the wings were edible and the pizza was just okay."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate the food but it never showed up. After a 1 hour 45 minute wait, we called and were given the \"it will be there any minute\" line, after 15 more minutes we called and canceled. They apologized and stated they were busy... after reading the other reviews it was probably best."}
{"text":"Ordered one pizza WITHOUT cheese, received one pizza WITH cheese, and then was given attitude when it was brought to their attention that they had not given us what we had specifically asked for IN WRITING. Then when the replacement came it just had clumps of spinach thrown on it instead of being all over the pizza.... Who eats balls of spinach? NOBODY."}
{"text":"Stopped there by chance while going to another store.  Stopped in and ordered pickup that I would stop by and get on my way home.  Food was ready in a snap.  Staff was very friendly.  I got pizza snd wings for the family and we all loved it.  The teriyaki wings were very tasty!!!  Will order from them again!!!"}
{"text":"Easily the worst pizza I have had in Pittsburgh (and I eat a LOT of pizza.) We got a pizza, breadsticks, cheese fries, and the fried cheesecake- none of it was worth eating.
*Pizza - Looked good, but was nearly completely tasteless... how is this even possible? Even the feta cheese topping (which was generous) didn't have any flavor. 
*Breadsticks - These were tiny, soggy, and came in a foam container for some reason. The butter and herbs on them also tasted very strange and chemical. Just horrible.
*Cheese fries - The soggiest delivery fries I have ever received. Did you deliver to 10 other houses first or something? Greasy and gross.
*Fried cheesecake - This looked like it might be the saving grace of the night, but nope. It was basically a fried tortilla with cheesecake filling, coated in cinnamon sugar, which I know sounds great, but it wasn't. It was cold and somehow had no taste. It's like they have a special device that removes flavor from things or something. The strawberry sauce helped a little, but not enough.

I honestly can't believe that anyone thinks this is good food... there are so many better pizza places around here (like all of them!)"}
{"text":"My little brother called and ordered boneless bbq wings. He went and picked them up for us. He came back with a dozen breaded mushrooms tossed in bbq.  How high are the employees lol?"}
{"text":"We've ordered from Hot Box several times. The pizza is always really good and the sauce is exceptional. I've never had a single complaint with my order, the quality of the food, or the timeliness ... And bonus!  You can order thru grubhub."}
{"text":"This is a very solid, independently owned pizza joint.  Great crust and they have those old school little pepperonis.  Takeout and delivery only. Quick preparation time."}
