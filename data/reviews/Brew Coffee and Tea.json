{"text":"I'm so excited! Excellent lattes made from 100% ethical ingredients. The owner/barista is SERIOUS about supporting local and ethical business. This is my first time being to a coffee shop where everything from the coffee to the syrups to the milk is local/ethically sourced. Literally, she uses LOCAL MILK. Delicious and wonderful and somehow it doesn't cost anymore than other coffee shops. I'm a coffee snob and I tell you this place is the real thing.   *Obviously the coffee can't be grown locally but it's ethically sourced by a local roaster. This place is tiny so there's no seating but it's definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Small place but amazing coffee and tea. Had the coconut caramel blended coffee and also the raspberry lemonade, loved them! Staff is awesome! Definitely recommend it, I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Officially best coffee in the area! Gotta check this cute little place out. Its a diamond in the rough for sure. The owner is super chill and the show Friends is always on so if you are super awkward and don't wanna talk to her you can watch an awesome show !"}
{"text":"Walkable coffee shops are always a treat in my book.  Sprinkle in some charm, personality, fantastic customer service, and you've found \"your local coffee spot\".  Sure, you could drive through a Dunkin or step into one of the many Starbucks in town, but Amber (the owner) is all about local and does her best to source from as many local vendors as possible-now that's awesome, especially for a small business!  So yeah, pretty much every review before mine was spot-on and I just wanted to validate all the rad things that were written about this little gem.  Oh yeah...and \"Friends\" is on all the time! :D  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great people and they make a great cup of coffee! I can tell the owner cares about what they do. They don't normally sell coffee beans but there was no hesitation in accommodating me when I wanted to buy a pound of beans. They put in an extra order for me from their supplier and let me know when they would have it in. Didn't even charge me in advance. Now that's going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to go to for coffee or tea. The barista is so sweet and I go there so often that she always remembers my order! Brew is located right across the street from EMCC so it's really easy for me to stop by before or after class to get my tea fix. I always get the friendliest service and I have never been disappointed! I love finding new local businesses and this one is definitely one to support!"}
