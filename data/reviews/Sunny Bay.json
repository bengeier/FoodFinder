{"text":"Awesome cantonese place. .. not as pricey as keung kee or congee queen...

Service is top notch for a chinese resto"}
{"text":"A week ago, I had dinner at Sunny Bay with a relative on her recommendation as she was a regular customer. Food was ok and the price was reasonable but the service was very slow. It was not busy at all and there was only one waitress who did not seem to know what she was doing and could not remember which table ordered what. Twice she made a mistake, placing the dish on our table and the second time just when I had my chopstick over it she took it away and said it was not for us and took it to another table. Then a few seconds later she brought the same dish back because it was what we had ordered!. I always give any one and any place a second try so I decided last night to order take out on some other dishes (nothing fancy) thinking that it would be faster. WAS I WRONG! Not only did we wait for 45 minutes, No one not even the owner came forward to apologize. OK they were very busy with  a huge order (20 to 30 dishes) which had to be delivered but then there were patrons who came much later after us to dine in and they did not have to wait long for their food. To top it all, we noticed that there were 4 customers who came in about 20 minutes after us to wait to pick up their food which they had ordered over the phone and they were served with a pot of tea while they waited. We were really p....'sd. How come we were not served with a pot of tea while we waited? This is bad business on their part. The same waitress just as inefficient as before like... serving dishes like one at a time (one in each hand) & clearing dirty dishes one at a time. What about using a tray? It is not just the food that is slow, the waitressing too! My parents ran a very successful restaurant business in the 50s & 60s and they would never operate like this or provide this type of service to any customer!
I will never go back to this place again. And the food we ordered Beef Ho Fun & Orange Beef, we threw them out because they were just lukewarm, smell bad and the Orange Beef tasted like it had been marinated for a week."}
{"text":"First time here with the family and it was a decent first experience. I wish I had been more hungry coming to eat here. The restaurant is at the end of the plaza so it is easy to find and it may just have opened recently as they had a grand opening sign at the front of their entrance. They also have televisions around the restaurant to keep customers entertained.  The restaurant is pretty clean and well maintained for a Chinese restuarant.  It was steady when we got there for dinner service and it seemed pretty busy for take-out service as customers were in and out quite often while we were there eating in. We were first served with tea and soup. The soup was warm in temperature but the tea was extremely hot.. Shouldn't it have been the other way around? None the less, the soup was yummy! We ordered a couple of dishes. To name a few we ordered some fish dishes, shrimp with scrambled eggs, beef and bitter melon in black bean sauce, some vegetables and green beans and a salt and pepper porkchop.  I thought everything was tasty and the size of the portions were decent. My favourite that I would recommend is the green beans with shredded meat.  Apparently, if you spend over $25, you get to choose a rib or pork dish for $1, which is an added plus.  Overall, the service that the waitresses provided was really good. They were patient, considerate and happy to work there, which usually isn't the case at an Asian restaurant. Lastly, we finished off with a deep fried wonton looking dessert that was dipped with honey or syrup with flakes of coconut.  This was my favourite part of the whole dinner. The waitress even offered to give us second rounds of dessert! We also got a Chinese dessert. Depending on the day of the week, they serve different types of Chinese desserts which is a nice variety rather than your typical red bean dessert. Yuck! I would definitely recommend coming to check out the sunny side of this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Spacious place with very friendly servers (a little short staff imo). Offers your standard Hong Kong cafe style affairs. But I did notice that they have a sign on the window advertising a hot lamb stew special for $16. Tried the \"fragrant herb chicken rice\" w/ hk milk tea for $8. The chicken was massive and cooked to perfection. Free desert treat when you ask for the bill."}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant kinda dark inside without music in the background around 5PM on a Monday. Ordered fried pork chop bun from the afternoon tea menu.  The milk tea that was part of the combo looked like coffee and tasted like water. After 2 sips I stopped drinking that. It could be the worse HK style milk tea ever. Pork chop itself tasted OK but not too crispy. Paid an extra dollar for the fries and I got something that was like soggy taters / pan fried potato sticks.  I believe their fried noodles and dishes will be much better."}
{"text":"Very yummy. Always fresh and friendly. The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Chinese for dinner? Why not? I have been here twice and both experiences were great. The food is delicious. Not as greasy as most Chinese places so that's an upside. My biggest compliment is that this is one of the only Chinese places that give you ice in your water when you ask them for ice water. (They gave a straw too!!) Sunny Bay is located at the far left of the plaza. and the sign is relatively large. Only bad thing about this shop is that it is far north and not very accessible by foot if you do not have a vehicle. It is not saturated like the other Asian restaurants on highway 7 in Richmond Hill, but it is by its lone self and is not very well known on the map. I would come back if I was in the area but I would not purposely travel so far for Chinese food. Until next time, JimStar Out!!

Update: This place is closed down."}

Sunny Bay is a good neighborhood restaurant for regular family dining.  I patronized here once for lunch and once for dinner.  

I quite enjoyed my dinner experience at Sunny Bay.  We ordered a Sirloin Beef Cubes Stir Fry with Chili ($8) and a Eggplant with Minced Pork Hot Pot ($8) from the combo menu.  The Beef dish was delicious.  It carried a level of heat that was not overwhelming.  The beef was quite well seasoned and thus tasty.  The Eggplant with Minced Pork Hot Pot was decent.  It was well seasoned with fish sauce and not spicy.  There was lot of eggplant and little minced pork.  If anything, I wish the sauce wasn't so thickened by corn starch.  The sauce tasted okay, and it was not harmful to consume, yet the appearance of a starchy sauce was not appetizing.  

For lunch, I ordered a Hainanese Chicken Rice lunch special ($8) that came with a free hot beverage.  The presentation of the Hainanese Chicken Rice looked good.  The chicken rice was the best part.  It was rich in flavors, well portioned and had a hint of oil fragrance.  The chicken was not good because the meat was tougher and dryer than acceptable.   The dipping sauce selection missed the dark soy sauce, though it is usual for HK cafe to omit it.  I'd say the lunch experience could be better, because the chicken meat was tough.  I did realize that I could have ordered a stir fry noodle, and my lunch experience would have been better.

The services was very good at Sunny.  The 2 waitresses were smiling and polite all the time.  One of the waitresses had a big enthusiastic smile that was \"sunny\" and warm (pun intended).

By all standards, you get good value from dining at or taking out from Sunny Bay.  The food is well portioned for both lunch and dinner.  Most selections in lunch menu are priced below $10.  All the selections from the dinner combo menu are priced at $8.  Even I am frugal, I find the food here affordable.  It doesn't hurt that the services are good, too.  One note is that the table we dined at was squeaky clean, an improvement since Jennifer K's previous visit.

I will likely revisit."}

Sunny Bay is another Hong Kong Style Cafe that opens in  the area.

Thai deco deco from the previous restaurant looks and feels a little out of place and tired.

Afternoon Tea Set from 2 pm ~ 5 pm has decent selection of snack and noodle dish from $2.99  and up. 

Deep Fried Chicken Wimg ($4.99) and French Toast ($3.29) were both tasty with deep fried goodness!

This place really needs cleaning as everything felt so sticky.....

Not worth coming here for a special trip but may come by if in the area..."}
