{"text":"Whenever I want to eat indian food, this is my go to restaurant! I have been coming here for over 10 years now and always leave satisfied after every visit. The owner is really nice and if he is there, he will come and ask how you are liking the food.   The service is pretty good, never had to wait too long for any meal. My favourite is the chicken biryani which comes with chicken, rice and onions.  The dessert options are a bit limited, but overall they have many options including a veg and non veg thali which is rare to find these days. Pricing is also very reasonable and the restaurant itself is very clean, which is also a plus."}
{"text":"This place never fails! Their food is great, the service is super-friendly/quick, and the ambiance is really relaxing. I've come here with my family dozens of times over the years and it's always an awesome experience!! I've been to a couple other Bombay Bhel locations, but this one is the best in my opinion(I think it's also the head location).  Service: I can't recall waiting too long for my meals here. The servers are really polite, professional and friendly. And the management is super-friendly too, they always come over to say hi :)  Food: Amazing. And the portions are decent for what you pay. My favourite entrees here are the chicken biryani, chicken tikka(dry) & chicken tikka masala. And my favourite starters are the aloo tikki & bhel puri. Channa masala here is also excellent! All of the meals I've had here are delicious and flavourful, but I honest-to-God have never EVER tasted a better chicken tikka anywhere! It is just soooo good! I don't even live close to this location, so if anyone in my family is passing by on the way to my place, I sometimes ask them to bring some for me... Simply because it is THAT GOOD! As close to my Mom's home cooking as it gets!  Atmosphere: Warm & family-friendly. There's often some eclectic indian-fusion-electro-lounge music playing in the background, and the decor is really pretty. It's also a nice place to host parties, with either family or employees, and they're more than happy to accommodate."}
{"text":"One of the best customer service ever provided.  Food was served hot and the service was quick. Taste was fresh, no complaints.  Definitely will recommend. Decor felt exotic, place was clean."}
{"text":"Food is nothing more than average tasting...though portion sizes are good. Under staffed and consequently long wait times. They seem to think they are busy even when only 5 tables are occupied. No focus on the simple basis...like do not serve glasses that have more water dripping g on the outside than contained in it and  do not serve a curry on a flat plate. Anyone have a ' Caution...floor wet with curry' ? Maybe time to change from Bombay Bhel to Mundane Mumbai."}
{"text":"Visiting from New Jersey and family and friends in the GTA suggested I eat there. It's a very nice atmosphere, there were traditional Indian pieces all over, and the Indian music playing was loud enough to be heard clearly, but quiet enough to not drown out conversation.  As soon as i walked in, I was being waited on. The staff ensured we were never left for more than 5 minutes without being asked if we needed anything.  Upon ordering our meals, the waiter made suggestions on what to order to ensure we had the optimal dining experience. I had the Beef Vindaloo, which was spicy, but not too much to take away from the meal. Between sharing an appetizer platter and my vindaloo, I still could not finish it. I'm going to enjoy that and garlic nann for dinner tonight.  The next time I come back, I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The stuffed onion kulcha is to die for....  Good Indian food - the gravy/curry dishes and breads are good. The thali has large portions for a single person, but quality suffers. I would avoid the thali.   Service is terrible, but that's the case with most Indian restaurants I find. There's this one short waiter who is polite and cheerful, you're lucky if he's serving you.  The ambiance is good, the far end has a statue of an Indian deity with waterfall effects which is artistically done and is the focal point of the room, and the music is soothing Indian instrumental."}
{"text":"Update: I had to come back again a week after. The vegetarian version of the butter chicken (paneer makhni) is just too good!!  I am a strict vegetarian and this is my favourite place to come in Toronto. Lots of great options, especially the apps like bhel puri and dahi puri. Some of my favourites include the paneer makhni and the vegetable biryani with raita. Awesome service too! And they renovated in January so the place looks poppin. Highly recommend this place to all foodies!"}
{"text":"Indian cuisine at it's finest! I highly recommend the Baingan Bartha, the Saag Paneer and the Chicken Tikki Marsala. The Raita is unique in that it is slightly carbonated and the yogurt is homemade from scratch with the finest ingredients.  I have spoken with the owner on many occasions and he is a stickler for healthy eating habits. (If you order a Diet Coke, be prepared for a brief lecture on the dangers of aspartame!) Just the kind of person you want in charge of food preparation! He is extremely knowledgeable and a welcome presence at my table any day. For the best Indian cuisine in the GTA, look no further than Bombay Bhel!"}
{"text":"Food is literally amazing. If you order the right items that is. For veg - the paneer makhni and bhengin burtha (sp?) Is legit too good.   Most of meat I like there, their tandoori chicken is real good ID give it a go."}
{"text":"Place used to be good a couple years ago when I went occasionaly.  We just went there, 5 PM on a Friday, we didnt get a server come to the table until close to 15 minutes had passed. The basic chicken curry was not good, the chicken had lots of inedible bits like cartilage and tendons that absolutely should have been trimmed off.   Other curries we had were good. Prices are up from 2 years ago, I \"think\" ....most of the curry dishes were anywhere between 14 and 16 bucks each."}
{"text":"I just moved into this neighbourhood and we stopped in this evening as I needed to satisfy my craving for Indian cuisine. Lots of parking, entered and we were greeted and seated promptly. We didn't wait long at all and our order was taken.  We started off by ordering the vegetable Samosa for an appetizer. The waiter returned shortly thereafter and informed us that they were out of vegetable Samosas they only had the beef ones. Fair enough we ordered three and then three more, they were on the smaller side but very tasty.  Main course was Chicken Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken with a side of rice and the garlic Naan all of which were very well prepared and tasty. The Chicken Tikka Masala had a very nice kick to it which leads to my one gripe, I had to constantly hunt the waiter down and ask for more water,  a pitcher or a refill check now and then would be much appreciated.  All in all a pretty good dining experience, dinner for two was 41 dollars plus tip. Seeing as I'm in the neighbourhood now I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Our family has ordered and enjoyed the food from this location and is usually our go-to when we want to order good quality Indian cuisine. We normally check our order after picking it up at any restaurant to ensure we have everything, or ask the employees if they can check and go through our order for us before we leave.   Tonight our family wanted to celebrate a special occasion together with some of our favourite dishes from this location. After confirming on the phone that we preferred to receive our rice in a separate container from the rest of our food (about 6 orders of rice), and after a seemingly thorough review of our order by the host at the restaurant, our rice was not in the bag with the rest of the food we received.    We called to complain because the drive is not a short one to go back to fix a mistake made by the restaurant. After explaining the situation the host offered to send our food in a cab, but instead went out of his way to deliver the food personally. This was an example of great customer service to correct the original mistake that was made.   We will order from here again in the future and were impressed by the effort made to right the wrong that had occurred."}
{"text":"I have eaten at other Bombay Behl restaurants in the past and cannot believe that this restaurant is affiliates with the others.  The food was horrendous to say the least. The term horrible is being too kind.  I recommend they shut this place down!!!!"}
{"text":"I just had the best chicken tikka of my life here. So incredibly flavourful with a beautiful green sauce and delicious salad topped with a slightly acidic dressing- perfect combo. The chicken was beyond juicy and the portion size was extremely generous (which I find to be an issue at some Indian restaurants).  Prices were great and the service was excellent. We ended up chatting with the manager and he was so friendly and inviting. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Keep it up. Very good food. Thank you guys. Thank you Chef. Very nice barbq. Wow. Please do give it a try."}
{"text":"Service was great while I was rushing to get a meal in during my lunch break. The butter chicken and garlic naan were delicious and generous portion sizes for lunch. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time while we were in the area.  Our usual go-to place is The Host in Mississauga however,  we wanted something a little less formal.  We arrived just after 4:00pm on a Sunday and there were only 2 other tables occupied in the restaurant.  We were seated fairly quickly.  We ordered a variety of dishes including:  a Tandoori platter (chicken beef and fish tikkas), makhni paneer, beef biryani, channa masala and naans.  The food arrived after about 20 minutes which was pretty quick.  The platter was plentiful however didn't seem quite fresh.  The fish and the beef kabobs were really dry.  The channa masala was fine in flavour yet was served luke warm instead of hot making me think that it was not prepared fresh.  The makhni paneer was waaay too (tomatoey?) tasting with not enough spice.  The beef biriyani was full of beef chunks which was a surprise but again,  not quite hot- just luke warm.  All in all,  the food was just ok- not bad enough to send back,  not good enough to warrant a repeat visit.  The major complaint about this place was the atrocious service.  No one checked on us even once after we received our food despite there only being a handful of tables occupied.  We had to flag down servers constantly in order to get a water re-fill or order tea, ask for the bill etc.  It was also quite pricey.  After spending over $100 for lunch,  I expected more.  With a plethora of good and cheaper indian restaurants in Mississauga and Toronto,  I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Usually I don't really eat much Indian food, but this is a rare case, and I'd say it was a good experience. My bro and I came with a friend, and they had a good experience last time. Came on a Sunday around 7pm and it was fairly quiet, guessing long weekend affects business.  Their menu had decent choices, from vegan ppl, to vegetarian, and protein and different curries. You can choose if you want rice or naan with your curries, we did a half n half.  My bro and I got the butter chicken. Creamy and mild, and the chicken was boneless and skinless which is nice. The rice grains are long, like your pinky finger nail size long which is still rice, but unusual for me.   The naan was very light, buttery, and pillow soft, and not dry overcooked charred and burnt. It was a nice enjoyable naan with curry. The service is alright, even though it was fairly quiet, we'd still have to flag down server for some stuff. I'm not sure if all Bombay Bhel is this quality, but this location is good. And they have large seating capacity available should you be interested in bringing big groups, but not sure if they have enough staff to prepare and help you well.  The meal was about $15 pp, which is decent for dinner I'd say."}
{"text":"vindaloo chicken was pretty tasty, although a bit too salty instead of spicy. The eggplant dish was delicious too.  I liked the roti better the nun, and the mango lassi was nice and thick.  The place wasn't busy at ask for lunch on the weekend, and the service was pretty fast.    I wouldn't mind going back there sometimes."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!Butter chicken and rice were served cold! Took the waitress 10min to get me water! Never coming back to this place again!"}
{"text":"The food itself is wonderful as long as you go to the restaurant itself. I love the pakoras...just amazing. The curries are so delicious and flavourful I can't even describe it.   But what bothers me is that we wanted them to cater an event in our home that started at 12:30pm and they refused to do it because of when they \"open.\" Clearly our event wasn't important enough for them and they needed an excuse. I say this because I doubt that they arrive after 12:30pm to prepare lunch. Non-breakfast restaurants typically start cooking in the mornings in preparation for the lunch crowd.   Why not just have a policy on a minimum size of a catering order instead of lying?"}
{"text":"SMALLEST PORTION SIZES I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!  Let me give you the run down: I went here with a party of 6, we ordered the Butter Chicken, Chana Masla, Palak Paneer, Shrimp Masla, 10 naans, and 2 rices. The total bill came out to be $90 + tip. Each dish was about $13.   Now let me tell you about these portion sizes. Each dish came in a SMALL soup bowl definitely not enough for 1 person. We were ALL in disbelief when we received our food. Supposedly the take-out sizes are 3x bigger but when you eat in the sizes are smaller because \"you are using our facilities\". My plate minus the naan looked like a small sampler dish. I was able to get maybe 3 or 4 spoonfuls of rice and 2 spoonfuls of each of the 4 dishes we had ordered. THATS IT!  We had to fill up on naan to get full, but to spend $100 in total to fill up on bread was the MOST UNSATISFACTORY dining experience I have had! AVOID EATING IN LIKE THE PLAGUE. I wish I had taken pictures of the food but if I had all the food would have already been eaten.   Food Quality 3.5/5, Service 1/5, Portion sizes 0/5, Price 1/5"}
{"text":"I liked their Bryani and malai kota.  Overall good ambience and good food. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good ole Bombay Bhel.  Always mediocre, nothing special, but one of those places you go to once or twice a year when you rule everything else out.  That's what happened to me one night when I had a hankerin' for some take-out butter chicken, naan and some rice.  I don't remember much about the food itself other then when I took a bite of my butter chicken and felt this solid object grinding as I chewed.  Figuring it was just a chicken bone I spit it out only to hear the light clanging of glass hitting my plate.  Yep, I just found a shard of glass.  Now, I'm not one to get angry over something like this, people make mistakes, heck I didn't even want my money back, what I was worried about were the others who might not be so lucky in spitting it out before their internal organs meet a new transparent,  jagged silicon based best friend.  So, I called the restaurant, gave them the low-down and was told they will investigate and the owner's son would call me the next day to talk about it.  A day went by and no word from the owner's son so I called back and was told he would call me in a bit, which he did only to chastise me for throwing out the remaining butter chicken in question, rather than keeping it for investigation.  For all those that fall into similar situations in the future, apparently you're supposed to keep hazardous glass-laden food items in your fridge after initial ingestion so a restaurant's extensive and well-trained forensic team can go all CSI on it.  Anyway a few arguments later I finally received a semi-apology and was told to talk to someone named 'Tony' the next day at 6 to get my money back. Was I about to get Soprano'd at Bombay Bhel?  The next day, I came in and asked for Tony, and brought him to a corner of the already small restaurant so that other customers wouldn't hear about the treat-of-the-week in my food.  Again, the first question that was asked of me was why I didn't keep the butter chicken in question to bring in.  Jokes aside, is this a thing?  If I find a razor-blade in my take-out soup do I keep the rest of the soup hermetically sealed in the fridge for future scientific research?  About 30 minutes later going back and forth between Tony and the owner who basically blamed me for the whole situation, Tony generously offered to give me a refund which I never actually asked for...for just the butter chicken.  After a look of insult and disgust for not being offered a full refund after finding glass in my food (I'd rather be offered nothing), Tony presented me with a riddle: Why should I get a whole $25ish back when I only found glass in my butter chicken?  Surely that doesn't warrant money back on something which was perfectly glass-less like the rice and naan.  Flabbergasted (it's tough to work that into sentences nowadays so I had to take the opportunity).  Anyway, flabbergasted I made it my mission to get a full refund and another 30 minutes and a slight scene later (sorry patrons that were there that night) I finally had $25 big ones back in my pocket.  Note to eating establishments: If someone finds glass in your food, apologize, offer a refund even if it's not asked for, and you know, try not to get glass in your food the next time."}
{"text":"From the outside this restaurant looks abandoned:  the patio is empty of tables and chairs and weeds are growing knee-high out of the pavement.  The exterior is such a turnoff we decided to just keep walking.  If the management can't take a few minutes to clean up their exterior I hate to think what's going on inside.  What a hole."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian place in Sauga.  Service is always good,  I go for dine-in and take out frequently.  Main dish is the paneer makhani, it's so well made.  Although at this point I've had every veggie curry they make.  All good. Their nann is perfect,  they make it very well.   Not just my favorite Indian place in Sauga but aside from a few gems in Toronto and Brampton,  this is some of the best Indian you will have in Ontario."}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow service. If you order a meal for pick up expect it to take twice as long as what they say. It's even worse if you eat in"}
{"text":"Bombay Bhel is one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Mississauga.  When I used to live there, I would go and order from there all the time! Their bhel puri is my favorite.  Their veggie biryani is okay.  I also discovered my love for muttar paneer (the green pea and cottage cheese curry) here.  The staff are always welcoming.  The places is clean, has a cool feel to it, with low lighting and Hindi music playing softly in the background.  I can't wait to come back here to munch on  some good old naan!!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite restaurant for last 6-7 years in Canada. Awesome food. Papdi chaat, thali, kadahi paneer, garlic naan, speed of service - everything is just amazing!"}
{"text":"Bombay Bhel is an excellent blend of taste and ambiance. I highly recommend it.  1. The location: is easily accessible via 407/HWY7 and 404  2. The interior and exterior: is chic and the personnel are friendly  3. Facilities: clean, fair lighting, tables and chairs in good condition. It has both a take-out and dine-in facility  4. Food selection: was good, Naan was warm and made at the restaurant-brilliant! Dishes were in good portions, rice was fantastic and everything tasted wonderful.  Areas for improvement:  1. Presentation: Water didn't have ice or lemon, ice is pretty basic especially in the summer; utensils are wrapped together with a napkin-really?-No handkerchiefs like any fine dining should have.   2. Personnel: chic uniforms would greatly complement the great service I received here.  3. Specialty meat: Kosher and Halal. That'll be a great way to expand clientele. Especially in Richmond Hill/Vaughn.  In summary, I highly recommend this restaurant and would go back for more! Check it out folks."}
{"text":"Came here first time on the advise of a friend. The butter chicken Poutine was amazing with the cheese curds and fries.  I just found the sauce to be a bit on the sweet side. The beef koema was so good. The chicken Tikka Masada was great so much food we couldn't finish. It will make for a good lunch tomorrow.."}
{"text":"Love the food, the service and serene decor.  Travel from Toronto just to get my fix...definitely worth the trek but wish they were closer.  The garlic naan and saag paneer are my must haves but the other dishes did not disappoint.  Tried the Yonge location as it's a little closer to home but unfortunately not the same."}
{"text":"It was \"okay\". Got there on a Friday night and at 6:30pm the place was near empty. The service was decent, the clientele was a interesting mix of families and students. It's too bad they don't deliver."}
{"text":"Awesome food! By far the best butter chicken I have ever had. The server told me they are known in the GTA for having the best butter chicken, and wow, it was amazing. Decor is really nice. Service was quick and friendly. The garlic naan option was so tasty."}
{"text":"It was very tasty. I had butter chicken. Simply amazing. My father had chicken tikka, that was really good as well. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to Bombay Bhel and they have won us over by their service. The food is fresh and hot.   My party ordered Butter Chicken, Tandori Chicken, Biriyani & Paneer.  Wholesome choices which came with orders of fresh and hot Naan.  I found the service to be great and even had the manager come on over for a quick chat to check on us to make sure everything was good.   The dining area is clean compared to other indian restaurants in that particular area of Richmond Hill.   They also have a pick up discount when you order through the website.   I have been back twice since my first visit and the service and food has kept up to standards since the first visit."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have ever had.  I would've given this place a 5, but the service is lacking a little bit."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was A+++.   We are cheap, so by checking in on Yelp we got two free samosas.. YIPPEE !   We also got the coconut calamari for starters. It was alright. It was a good try to put a twist on the typical calamari. It was served with the same sauce that is served with the samosas. I think it would've tasted better with a ranch sauce or spicy ranch.    For entrees we got the tikka masala (chicken) and also this cashew nut curry- i dont remember the correct name for it but it was a vegetarian curry. Both were DEEELICIOUS! And not spicy at all which was a tad bit disappointing. We had it with garlic naan and rice and with mint and mango chutney.   The service was phenomenal. I drink alot of water and is often left with an empty cup craving for more. However i was never left with an empty cup. Everyone was so nice, service was exceptional.   Would definitely recommended this place.   Batniss signing out."}
{"text":"I work close by and this is a great place to go for lunch as they have a lunch buffet, they have enough vegetarian options. Usually about 3-4 Vegetarian options in the buffet (that is besides the deserts, rice, naan and all the other stuff that goes along with most indian food.)  Lunch buffet was about $14 (they add gratuity), so beware, don't tip on top of that if you don't want to.  Food is flavourful and the palak paneer is awesome.  Service is great and fast, it is a little dark inside, but there is enough room to seat a fair number of people.  This restaurant is close to the Toronto Centre for Arts, so its great for dinner and a show."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place. The Reno and the finishings in this restaurant look fantastic. The management spend time with their clients and know how to be great Indian hosts. Your food is served on authentic platters and have rich flavours, true to the region. Raj, the owner, gives you the feeling of being family! There is plenty of seating and the place is very clean. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"The food is a bit pricy and the portions could be bigger, but it's always tasty. When dining in, some servers are better than others. Food usually arrives quickly. Overall, this is a very good restaurant."}
{"text":"My friend had a promo coupon, so we went to enjoy some nice Indian fare close-by after work.   We ended up being one of the last people to leave the restaurant as it closed (9:30, seriously???), and enjoyed our assortment of naan, curries (w/ rice) and -- wait for it -- butter chicken poutine. Yes, BUTTER CHICKEN POUTINE! It was the perfect amount of sauce, so the fries were not soggy at the bottom.  Restaurant size: On the same side of the plaza as Bar Burrito and Hero Burger, you would think you would have brace yourself for cramped seating like the aforementioned establishments. However, it is quite spacious inside! There are booths which  can fit at least 4 people, as well as longer seating sections for your larger parties.  Portion size: A healthy amount of food arrives nice and hot, ready for consumption! If you're a lighter eater you may need a takeaway box. My friend and I are both Finishers, and even then we slightly struggled...  Service: It was quick to get a table and our orders. Perhaps it was due to a weeknight, but there was only one server staff for the entire restaurant. The gentleman did a fine job!  Final thoughts: If you're in the area, need to fill your craving for Indian cuisine and don't want to deal with The Host, you should consider Bombay Bhel! Too bad Commerce Valley E/7 is such a pain though..."}
{"text":"Did takeout and the food was AWESOME. The butter chicken is really good and everything else we tried (like the mango chicken and appetizers). If you are looking for excellent Indian food in Vaughan look no further. Ignore the low reviews, they don't know good Indian food. High quality and tasty. Will come back again and again."}
{"text":"Love this place for Indian food!  There's an Indian place right across the road from where we live, but we trek out an extra 15 minutes by car to Bombay Bhel because it's soooo much better.    We usually order 1 butter chicken, 1 chicken thali (a great mix of curry, rice, daal and naan) and 2 orders of garlic naan.  It's kind of like their version of garlic bread.  Buttery and garlicky, hot and chewy.  Delicious!    Samosas are yummy too-very crispy, but too small for me.  I could easily eat 3 in one sitting.  I think one order is one piece.    Service can be inconsistent too-depending on our waiter we may get a complimentary basket of pappadums or not.  Still-everything else makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Let me say I am a \"Huge\" fan of Indian food. Unfortunately, this place is easily the worst Indian food I have had in Toronto. I had a lunch meeting there today. The food is not FRESH. It is micro-waved.  Extremely lousy and they are certain to close. Please take my advice and skip this place, they are not worthy of your money, business or patronage.  We ordered their most expensive MEAT COMBO. The lamb curry was terrible, and the TANDOORI chicken were two crappy dehydrated old drumsticks. I really should have walked out after the first bite.  I hate to write such a review but they have no idea how to cook or run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the beef vindaloo and the palak pander and they were extremely tasty! Highly recommend! If you're doing take out - call first!"}
{"text":"I will be precise...Don't eat from here. I've never had this bad quality food in Mississauga.  Highly recommend not to take your kids otherwise they will have upset stomach for sure, the next day.  \"0000000000\" stars from our side."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Had the Briyani with Curry and Naan with Nutella: - Briyani was good. - Curry was good. - That naan was something.  8/10 would return."}
{"text":"Overall a low key, sub-par food experience. Not a place I'd recommend, but it's not like I would tell you to stay away either...  Food (3/5): Alright so I had the vegetable samosas, pani puri, and the butter chicken with garlic naan. The vegetable samosas had a bubbly skin to it and were alright, but I could do with less grease. The pani puri was disappointing. They gave the shells and then chickpeas and potatoes.. pretty much plain. Then some sauces. Looking at it was disappointing, eating it was even more disappointing. Would not recommend you order that here. The butter chicken was slightly better, but I found it was still lacking in the strong flavours that I love so much about indian food. It was almost like eating butter chicken on mute. It's butter chicken, but its not the best I've had. The chicken was slightly hard and dry on the inside considering it sits in tons of sauce. The garlic naan is incredibly garlicky but I like my naans slightly thinner and easier to pull apart haha. At least their mango lassi was good!  Price (3.5/5): It's a low key place so they've got $1-2 price advantage compared to fancier places. For all the things I ordered + 1 extra main for my boyfriend it came to $50 between the the 2 of us with food to take home.  Service (3.5/5): Honestly the service is more on the 3 side because it was awkward af... but so awkward it was almost funny (?). 3 key moments: 1) the waiting asked us if we were ready to order and we said yes. In reply he said, \"ok give me 2 minutes.\" Like wut? 2) as a different waiter was pouring water my friend was looking at the glass. Awkwardly the waiter stopped and looked at my friend with a confused look. My friend, \"sorry, i didn't mean for you to stop, can you keep filling up my glass?\" haha I don't really know what the waiter was thinking. 3) as the waiter was taking our dishes she ends up clumsily DROPPING THE KNIFE onto my boyfriends lap. In a rush, he picked it up and kind of shied away ashamed. Nothing really happened, but the service was so awkward it was funny...   Atmosphere (3/5): Very low key, almost home-like. Not much else to say, its a medium sized establishment and was moderately full throughout the time we were there for dinner on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fantastic customer service!  On a short trip to the area I went here twice because it was delicious!  On the second time the machine skipped the tip  (probably user error,  but I never saw the screen! ). The server was so kind and it doesn't effect his customer service towards us."}
{"text":"The food was incredible!  Was so happy to see they had Thali and for the price ($13) you got so much food!!!  Flavour was wonderful, nothing greasy or too salty. My husband had the tandoori chicken and it was a huge plate, served quickly and great taste.  Service was amazing and we had good to spare so excited to have lunch again tomorrow!   Highly recommended and will be coming back."}
{"text":"We visited this place as a couple to try the famous CHOLE BHATURE. This restaurant was one of a few indian places that serve this dish. We also ordered Lamb Bryani. Both dishes were absolutely delicious and spiced with perfect balance (not too spicy to make it hard to enjoy the food but still enjoyable for people who like spicy food).   The staff were very nice, professional and friendly with great and efficient service which made our dining experience very delightful. The menu prices were reasonable and relative to the quality and quantity of food actually really great.  We are definitely already thinking about going back another time to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Great food.  I eat here every time I'm in the GTA (about once a month). Mango Lassi is so good!"}
{"text":"Went there to curb chaat cravings with a couple of friends. Ambience is nice as far as desi restaurants are concerned, coming back to food we tried mix Papdi which was delish and made to order spicy or mild. Panni puri was a big fail, the water that came with it had no spicy kick to it. Would definitely go back to try more things as the chicken is Halal here. The servers were doing a good job, courteous and patient."}
{"text":"Food quality is absolutely horrible. I got a delivery through uber eats recently, and the onion pakoras were dropping in oil. The wrapped it up in a paper towel and threw it in a brown paper bag for delivery. I've had several other items from this place and was never once impressed. The pakoras were my last draw thought. Please stop serving low quality food. The host is right across from this place, a bit pricier but at least better quality food. Not ideal for \"authentic\" Indian food for sure."}
{"text":"Long due review. I have been coming to this restaurant with friends and family upon every visit to Brampton for some years and it never disappointed me. Except for a service once and not so fresh veggie biryani we ordered yesterday. It was old but everything else we ordered was super nice. Really love the food here and will go here until they exist:)"}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices - one the best butter chicken in the city.  I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"6ppl had to wait 40 min+ before we got any food. we had made reservation too. also had ordered two samosas which didn't come until after entrees arrived; in addition, we had to remind the waiter that we were missing one samosa. in conclusion, food was good; experience was 2/5."}
{"text":"In the Toronto area for business and this place is a pleasant surprise as it is right across the way from my hotel.  The food was very tasty and fresh and the prices were reasonable.  The service was solid.  My only complaint is that the portions were quite small.  Was there with 2 co-workers and we each ordered an item to share with the group.  Before we knew it we were pretty much out of everything and no one could really go back for more- oh well, not that big of a deal."}
{"text":"The food here is so authentic and delicious. It's flavourful without being overly spicy. The chicken is white meat, juicy and perfectly cooked, with no veins in it - veins are a big turn off for me!! The service is always attentive and they remember our order when we return. This will continue our favourite place for Indian food!"}
{"text":"We arrived Mothersday Lunch on a Sunday 1 pm opening, 2hosts at the door, no greeting just do you have a reservation, then pointed to the ones with reservations, but we felt kinda insulted with no greeting,  entrance has limited waiting area, numerous tables with 4 seats . Menus were given as water glass followed tables did not have cutlery at first,were brought shortly after, tables had cloth settings with brown paper as an additional cover, after waving the server we gave our orders- Pani Puri as an app 4 samosas with house Tamarind sauce was very good Main dish- two Non veggie Thali We chose beef as our choice Menu is in my pictures, as well as food photos Drink-mango Lassi In all food was good, nothing memorable great for once a try, but will be coming to try other stuff just may not get the thali. Did not like service after the food, they forgot about us, we need water refills, and cutlery and napkins but as we finished no one came to give us the bill we walked to the person on cash, a man with turban who seemed to be the owner. Very little greeting or acknowledgement except bill/charge/ receipt . Fix service pls be attentive."}
{"text":"Arrived 10 minutes before closing one night. We were told they are closing soon, but would be happy to squeeze us in before closing, and hoped we understand some items may be unavailable this late as they take too long to prepare (there was a specific item mentioned).  The server was a so personable and helpful. We also had two other servers stop by to kindly check on us and fill our water as we ate - bonus points for this, as Indian restaurants are uncommonly lacking in this area.  Two of us shared the following order: two naan breads (made to order), one butter chicken (chicken with creamy tomato curry sauce), one saag paneer (cooked spinach/cheese/spice mix) and one veggie korma (veggies in curry sauce, mostly cauliflower & potato), with one side of rice.  The smallish serving dishes looked disappointingly small at first, but served two of us very well (I was stuffed), with leftovers for one of us the next day.  I have had A LOT of butter chicken and naan in my life, and this flavour was up there with the best of the best.  I had visions of just grabbing the chicken dish and pouring the sauce right in my mouth/on my face.  I dipped every last bit of naan in that hot mess of deliciousness.  So addictive!  The server even sat another large party shortly after us, so they weren't shy about staying open later than their posted hours. Nice to know that the service came first, at least on this night.  I have tried to update the map location which is actually near 407 & 404.  Even though this place is WAY out of my way (I live downtown), I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had almost all the appetizers on their menu and tasted some of the freshest and delicious dishes we had in a very long time. The spices are balanced, dishes are well portioned and prices are reasonable. We did not venture out to the main course in this visit but going by the quality of the starters the entrees are sure to be good. Service is friendly and quick. This place sure deserves a visit. We look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"I ordered butter chicken, naan, and chicken biryani.  Service: 5/5 (friendly staff and fast service)  Clean: 3/5 (dining area looks clean but not much washroom is OK clean. I don't know about kitchen)  Price: 2/5 ( $35 is pricey based on chicken legs dishes)  Amount: 3/5 (it is enough for 2 with a bit extra remaining ) Taste: 4/5 (I don't like chicken legs but it was reach taste and well prepared, but it lacks white meat served in the dish. Overall: 3.6 /5 (I actually like it. I recommend to try it.  Even though it is not my first choice but I feel satisfied to eat there. I enjoyed it and I will go and try something else there and I will update my review if need it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is nice, but their food just isn't right.  I'm not Indian, but their dishes don't even come close to what I've experienced in any other Indian restaurant.  One bite and you know they're just not what is advertised.  It's not close to their other locations (which aren't the same either), and even a friend of mine who is Indian agrees with me.  I guess if you like it, you could think it's great, but I didn't and I'm staying away from this location in the future."}
{"text":"Been going to this location since at least 2002. Amazing food up till 2011-13.  I went in 2014 maybe the food was ok. I actually asked if they had changed the cheif and the man came out. And actually recognized me. Laughs.   Anyway.... last week. The food is TERRIBLE!!!! DONT GO.  Its so bad that i couldnt even bring myself to complain how bad it is. I just paid to get out of there.  Eglinton location is a better experience, with a nicer dinning area and presentation. (I went kn my birthday got a thali and went i went a week later... they charged me $6 more plus the waitor was terrible).  But the best value and food is on Erin Mills. GO THERE!!!"}
{"text":"Out of the 3 locations in mississauga. This is second best. The best one is Erin Mills.  If you are trying to impress someone and dont mind paying extra this is the place. Otherwise, go to Erin Mills. Best tasting food. Great service. No extra charges.   These guys charge through the nose if you make alterations to your meal. And the service i received the last time was TERRIBLE. (Also... they have the smallest to go tea cups out of all locations).   Ive been going to these locations for over 15 years now.   DO NOT go to Dundas location. It was so bad I couldnt even complain. I just paid to get out of there."}
{"text":"BEST BOMBAY BHEL IN MISSISSAUGA!!  DO NOT go to the other locations.  These guys have the beat tasting food. And dont charge u though the nose of u make changea to your meal.   DO NOT go to the dundas location!!!  Eglinton is nice experience but will charge for any alterations on your meal. And the servee was terrible the last time i went."}
{"text":"I tried a few different dishes today. The lamb Vindaloo was more mild than I would expect from a Vindaloo and some pieces of lamb were really tough. The samosas were absolutely delicious and had a nice amount of spice (not very hot either). The naan was nice and soft. The chicken biryani was okay.   The food was good, but I like more flavourful and spicy Indian food. Especially Vindaloo. That dish needs to be hot!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Indian food.  by far the best in Mississauga!  Fresh, full of flavour and the naan are to die for!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We've been going to Bombay Bhel for a few years now, and I love everything. The appetizers are amazing- the pani poori is sooo good! The paneer is excellent, I highly recommend the tikka paneer. I've been off meat lately and there are so many good vegetarian options. My husband always does the same thing- biriyani. It's pretty great. The service is excellent. We have eaten in the restaurant a few times and enjoy the staff, but the convenience of phone ordering for pickup really what keeps us coming back. The phone service is super convenient."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants of all time! The food has so much flavour and with all the different choices everybody will be happy! The food is always consistent and yummy! The staff is awesome and the owner is so friendly. It's my soul food and the best Indian food around!"}
{"text":"Dal Makhani, Paneer Tikka Masala and Reshmi chicken tikka are all HORRIBLE tasting!! I couldn't have tried anything else.Bad food."}
{"text":"Came on a saturday evening, the restaurant was about half full. Good atmosphere and decorations. There are 2 servers and they're pretty good with their service.   Ordered: Mango Lassi - good portion size and refreshing  Chicken Biryani - had a choice of curry sauce or yogurt sauce. Flavourful and chicken was tender, but not hot enough  Chicken Tandoori - Came with 3 pieces of chicken on a bed of green salad. Not as spicy as other restaurants  Navratna Korma - Mixed veggies and paneer in a cashew nut sauce. It's sweet and not as heavy as butter chicken. However it was made with frozen mixed veggies - maybe can improve with fresh produce  Naan is a decent size, soft and hot.   Got 2 vegetarian samosas on the house with a Yelp checkin - good size and piping hot.  The food took a while to come, otherwise would come again."}
{"text":"Went here on a friend's recommendation and I was not disappointed. Got the thaali with goat curry, butter chicken, and garlic naan, and everything was delicious. The garlic naan is the best i've ever had! The tandoori chicken was amazing. Butter chicken veryyy savoury. The food took very long to come out, but I'm fine with it because the food tasted fresh and was savoury. The waiters were attentive. It's on the pricy side (paid total $50) but I would still pay it for this amazing quality food. I'd definitely travel here again from Toronto if I feel like Indian food."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for Indian, though I'm definitely no expert (thus I can't comment on whether other places have much better prices/portions). Among the 3 dishes we ordered and naan, I didn't find myself stuffed so... it's possible portions are smaller. However, flavor was intact and I was happy with the food.   It was vegetarian night for me, so we ordered Malai Kofta (cottage cheese and potatoes in a tomatoey sauce), Aloo Gobi (curried cauliflower), and Palak Paneer (cottage cheese with curried spinach). I was a fan of all dishes, but Malai Kofta was my favourite! (I think Paneer Makhni would taste quite similar and also as good but did not try this)  Atmosphere was very comfortable for an intimate dining setting, and service was attentive. I think this is not a bad place for some good Indian food with friends or as a date!"}
{"text":"Biryani and chicken tikka are great . Reasonable prices as well . I think desert could be better. Overall great place for a meal"}
{"text":"The food is pretty tasty plus for me it's such a good deal to get their vegetarian thali. I go every so often and I can typically actually share the thali, and it's just $12 - but includes 2 vegetable dishes, dhal, naan, rice, dessert and raita. They're also great with us substituting out the dessert for another vegetable dish! Their servers are really nice too and they are pretty fast."}
{"text":"Went here late Friday night.  It was very busy but we had to wait only 10 mins to be seated.  I ordered the butter chicken and samosas, while others in my group ordered other meat and veggie entrées.   Both the butter chicken and samosas were very good. The portion size was abit small compared to other restaurants but I think it was just right.   Service was fast and efficient , and the restaurant had a Buddhist feel to it.  Will go back next time I'm in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Been here twice and loved it!  Good service VERY fresh food. In our butter chicken and vindaloo dish, the chicken was SOOO scrumptious, tender and juicy. This is how you know it was made to order and cooke to perfection. At a lot of indian restaurants the chicken is an afterthought.   Crispy delicious fresh naan here as well to go with thei bomb diggity butter chicken. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We have only been there once. The food and the service were both good. The owner took our order and remembered everything that we wanted and the way we wanted without having to write anything down. We tried 2-3 dishes 1 vegetarian and 2 non-vegetarian and everything was good. We live far away but we'll be back to try some more when we are in the area."}
{"text":"A nice little restaurant, great energy and friendly service. I had the butter chicken and although it wasn't bad tasting whatsoever, it was very salty and not as buttery as I am used to. Again, it didn't taste bad, but it just wasn't as good tasting to me as the butter chicken I have had many times before. Clean establishment with nice staff."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the lamb biryani, butter chicken, daal and saag paneer - everything was top notch - this is the best Indian I have ever had in my visits to Toronto."}
{"text":"We have had both take out and sit down at Bombay Bhel.   Food is always great.   Especially like  the Chicken Vindaloo, vegetable pakora, navratam korma, tandoori chicken and nan bread.   Give it a try, you will be hooked."}
{"text":"This place does standard Indian fare and does it well. It was not overly salty or ridiculously greasy. Besides, their non-vegetarian dishes actually have more than two little pieces of meat. Our beef vindaloo had a generous helping of beef. We accompanied the vindaloo with butter chicken, naan and raita. They had a mild chicken karahi that my young daughter enjoyed. The place would be a wonderful choice for business lunches since it has lovely decor and fast service. We will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"This place has the slowest service - appetizer came quickly but the rest of the food didn't come until at least 45 minutes later. We tried several times to catch the attention of the servers, who, by the way, only served one table at a time and would walk away, either back to the kitchen or wherever.   The food was mediocre at best, the only decent thing was maybe their garlic nan. Curry lamb was watery, bland, no lamb gaminess. The chicken tikka was a bit dry and also bland. Rice pudding was pretty standard, nothing special.   The worst thing was definitely the service. The nicest person was a lady who poured water and gave take out boxes. She noticed that we were waiting and that we were was constantly ignored.  Save yourself some time and go a little farther to a better Indian food place."}
{"text":"The lamb tikka was phenomenal. Quite impressed with the tenderness of the meat. We also had the chicken tikka masala and it was very tasty as well.  it appeared that all the tables around us ordered the butter chicken so either it is very good or that is the only dish that people in Toronto recognize.  The service was acceptable. Nothing spectacular but certainly adequate.  Skip the masala chai."}
{"text":"Nah, the food was not good at all. Had the weekend lunch buffet for $12.49, limited dishes and not tasty. The curries were bland and the desserts were much to be desired. The naan was indeed very good - perhaps the only fresh item on the buffet? Too pricey for the what we got. Would not recommend this joint to anyone!"}
{"text":"Customer service was nice. Veg thali was decent enough with big portions. The papri chat was a huge disappointment. Tandoori prawns were a disappointment too. They had grill marks on them but there was a pool of what looked like raw marinate underneath them .. so gross... and the portion was pretty small for the price.  One extra star for clean toilets... such a rare thing to find."}
{"text":"I had almost given up on finding good Indian food in Markham that was reasonably price. Then I found this place. Zounds! Was this the answer to my prayers?   I had the butter chicken with naan with a mango lassi. The chicken was tender and flavorful. The butter sauce was creamy and perfectly spiced. The lassi was thick and delicious. Is the price right? It's neither cheap or expensive but for the quality... it's fair. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Walking into this restaurant I had high hopes and an unbearable desire for butter chicken. I ordered the butter chicken, some garlic naan and some rice and a bottle of red wine. Everything looked appetizing and tasted even better.  It is one of the more expensive Indian restaurants, at least for butter chicken anyways. But it was worth it.  The service I received was short of perfect. The servers are all dressed up, to give the feeling of class and they're nice too. Servers are always walking around making sure you're doing okay.  The atmosphere was nice and relaxing, they have couches with pillows on it which made me just wanna fall asleep after my meal.  All and all, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone trying to satisfy their butter chicken craving."}
{"text":"The decor of the restaurant is lovely. The staff were attentive.  This is our first time trying this restaurant and it was OK. Not amazing. Maybe my expectations were high from all the Yelp reviews. We tried the Butter Chicken (wouldn't order again, very sweet!). Reshmi Chicken from the clay oven (tasty but nothing special) and the Chaat Papri. We also decided to change to the garlic Naan which is an addition charge and wished we hadn't and saved the $4.00.  The only difference is they slab a TON of that granulated garlic you'd buy in a bottle. So essentially it's Naan with raw garlic slabbed on top afterwards.   The portions were small and price high. For these reasons I'd be reluctant to return."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to find some good restaurants for Indian food. I came here on a weekday for dinner. The restaurant was pretty empty with only about 4 tables full. We were seated at one of the booths...my friend sat down and the booth chair fell back on her. The server immediately came towards our direction and apologized for that. He seated us at another booth and gave us the menus.   I checked in on Yelp and saw a free samosa offer. Upon ordering, I showed it to the server and he told me that they've asked Yelp to take it off for a while but it's still there. However, he still gave it to me. They were vegetable curry samosas; the biggest ones I've seen! It came with a tangy sauce that is really nice when paired with the fried samosas.   Since I'm all about trying new foods and wasn't sure what to order, I decided on getting something with more variety. I ordered the Non-Veg Thali (chicken). Itis basically an assorted platter of tandoori chicken, curry chicken, rice, naan, daal, raita, papadum, pickle, and dessert. The naan I got was pretty burnt so it was crispy and hard to the bite. I enjoyed the tandoori chicken and curry chicken as the meat was very tender. The papadum was also quite tasty. If you've had shrimp crackers, it tastes similar to that. The server also came to check on us a few times and even explained to us what everything was (my friend and I both ordered this). I didn't really like the dessert and the sour pickle as the sourness was next level.   The restaurant was very nicely designed with brick looking walls. The service was really good and attentive. I will be back to try more of their foods!"}
{"text":"3.5 I've been here a handful of times and order the butter chicken and samosas. Pretty solid Indian restaurant.  The computers that they use are from 1970s though. Their IT team needs to step up their game. Aren't there a lot of Indian IT professionals out there that can help these guys?"}
{"text":"Good food, okay pricing for the quantity. The dishes taste good for the most part- the shrimp tandoor thing was so great flavourful with big shrimp. The Brie pakoras were great --- you have to try them!! but I would have liked more for the price.  We tried some vegetarian curries and some classic meat ones, as well as the butter chicken - which was sweet? I'm not a fan of sweet butter chicken- but it was creamy.  The naan was bone dry- like so dry I had to ask for some sort of oil or butter on it. Also- they forgot to bring us a naan which was included with our dish.  Good Indian food, decent flavour and could improve with quantity of the appetizers."}
{"text":"Om nom nom. I've not been to the other Bombay Bhel's, so my review might not be as useful as some of the others, but I felt that the food here was decent. I ordered take out as I didn't have time to enjoy a sit down meal (toddlers, amiright?), but husband and I was happy full by 2/3rd of the meal so we would call it a slight win?  My biggest irk: I couldn't find prices online anywhere. The website posts a menu, but there are no dollar amounts attached to it - so I've posted their take out menu here. Also, I ordered a Thali (based on other reviews), and I was surprised to find out it cost me 17 bucks. Or something, I still don't know how much the Thali was - simply because it's not even on their take out menu. All I know is, I ordered a chicken thali and a palak paneer, and the meal came out to around $35. Which is a bit bonkers, but how can I argue? I didn't know the prices ahead of time!  The palak paneer was good, but a bit rich - the paneer was yummy. The chicken thali was very filling - husband was very content with sizing and assortment (he loved the dessert the best). I thought the tandoori chicken was well flavoured and juicy.  Would I order from here again? Probably, but it probably won't be my first choice as I'd rather pick up from somewhere else. If ever I decide to dine in, I'll give it a go here."}
{"text":"I love this place. The design and ambiance are very nice and soothing .  We tried the butter chicken, lamb buriani and pakora. All good and the portions are more than enough for two people. We ended up taking the rest home.  The prices are also good. They have friendly and professional  service."}
{"text":"Came here with 5 friends on a Monday after watching the NBA All-star Game and playing drinking games till 3 am the previous night.  All 6 of us ordered the butter chicken off the daily lunch which comes with your choice of naan or rice.  If you check in with Yelp, you can redeem 2 free Vegetarian Samosas if you order 2 entrees.  We ordered 4 more vegetable samosas so that everyone could try one.    Vegetarian Samosa ($0.95 each) - Pastries stuffed with seasoned potatoes.  These were smaller than other samosa's I've had in the past.  They were crisp outside and tasted average.  Also came with tamarind sauce.     Butter Chicken with Naan from daily lunch special ($10.50) - Tender charcoal roasted chicken simmered in rich tomato butter flavored gravy accented with dry fenugreek.  The flavor of the sauce was very creamy and sweet.  The chicken was tender but I found the portion was rather small as there was only about 6 cubed size pieces of chicken.  My naan came warm and was charred a bit too much as there was an area that was as dark as charcoal.  The other naan's looked like they were charred better without being burnt.  It also comes with a few slices of cucumber, one tomato slice drizzled with some Italian dressing as a small salad.    Service was great at the beginning as they gave us small plates and cutlery to eat the samosa's and refilled our water when asked.  However, when they served the entrees, they brought out 5 and completely forgot about the last.  We had to flag down the waiter a few times to get his attention.      I took 2 stars off because:  I felt the food portion sizes could be bigger My naan was over charred that an area was burnt Service could have been improved"}
{"text":"We went there last weekend for a lunch buffet. The food is delicious and is home quality; however, there are not many options. They had 4 curries and tandoori chicken, a very basic salad (just lettuce and carrots), naan and very basic indian dessert. All in all, it is very basic Indian food. Nothing special. Good for casual weekday lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their shrimp curry is delicious. The sauce is flavourful and full of vegetables, and the shrimp itself is perfectly cooked. The naan is great too, and you get a few big pieces with every meal. Can't wait to go again and try some of their vegetarian options."}
{"text":"With the portions that are pictured above and the steep prices combined with the mixed reviews. I was very reluctant to ever try this place. However it was a work outing , and majority rules!  To my surprise tho however, it was actually a pretty giant meal. It was 5 grown men and we actually had some leftovers. I would suggest that you get the platter as it is an assortment of meats (chicken, shrimp, kababs) and it fills you up very quick, the tandoori wings were amazing. The biryani was delicious as well. The curry's are on the milder side for those who enjoy spice. The naan is better then a lot of establishments.  I am going to stick to my intuition and say that yes they are small portions and are expensive for a la carte menu. Especially considering so many buffets around the vicinity. However the food was amazing. The platter did do wonders or else; there would be a star missing. Expensive- but worth it every once in a while."}
{"text":"Come on B.B, how is it you started off with linens an now brown paper lines your tables as if we are at jack astors. Why does the tandoori chicken come with ketchup packets. Where is the class.  Came here after a long time this week for my bro's bday. We ordered a spectrum of things, from lamb korma, to seafood curry.   The puri's were good, and the food was AVG.  So they don't have dessert other than ice cream and ladoos...lame.  I would come here for a quick bite but why bother when Saravaana Bhavan is in the plaza beside this...  Nicely designed decor though, cool waterfall wall with statues. But again...why construction paper instead of table clothes. I cant take this place seriously anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered Samosa. Pakora and Papri chaat for a total of 20$cad which I consider quite steep for the exprience.  Samosa was had a new spice flavour which did not bode well.  Pakora was too dense and was not well prepared.  Papri chaat was acceptable however had the same spice flavour noticed earlier in the  Samosa, also it was missing chopped onions and green chilies which is similar to having salsa with out tomatos or onions.   Food was below average however resturant was clean and well kept.   Most of the patrons were non tradational which could be explained by the kind of Indian food rendition this place touts.  Will not visit again once was more than enough."}
{"text":"My experience at Bombay Bhel was spectacular. The service was great and we celebrated a family's birthday there not too long ago. We ordered their appetizer dish which had a bit of everything, curry chicken, and the list goes on. They served us ice cream as well. Overall, it was very hearty and delicious! Highly recommend this restaurant to ones who have yet to taste Indian food/dishes!"}
{"text":"Mehhhh. It's alright. When I walked into this place, the décor was pretty crap. And I know that it represents North India any way. As a person that has an Indian origin, I wanted to give this really high expectations. But, after 10 minutes, it quickly plummeted straight into rock bottom. Let's start with the apps. POPCORN SHRIMP: Lies. All lies. At first, I was hooked since it's like popcorn shrimp. But they lied. It's not breaded. And, it doesn't taste good either! ONION PAKORA:Wayyyyyyyyyyyy too greasy. But, it tastes good. BUTTER CHICKEN POUTINE: This is the only appetizer that I LIKE. I mean, come on, Quebec Poutine with Butter Chicken Sauce? How bad could it be? So, the apps are meh. But the thing that I hate is...        SERVICE: The service in this restaurant is really, really GARBAGE. Do they have dumb people in the kitchen or what? It takes 45 minutes to a full hour to get your food. Also, it's wayyy too understaffed. Also, they put the drinks( in their form) and glasses. What's the point of that? Just ask if you like it physical or in a glass? And, they think like they are doing it one order at a time So, the service is horrible. Now let's go to the entrees. NAAN(regular): It tastes good, but the naan in HUGE. I like mine in quarters(¼). Since it's SO huge, I need to tell the waiter to cut it. And they didn't cut them into quarters. Instead, they cut it unevenly from ¾ to  pieces of just 1 naan. CHICKEN BIRIYANI: It's only okay. CHICKEN TIKKA: Don't know why they added something else(I don't know? A salad?) with it but, this is a must have. The chicken is nice and tender with the right amount of spice. BUTTER CHICKEN: This is another must have when you're going to this restaurant. A great sauce with a reasonable portion of chicken. And once again, the chicken is tender. CHICKEN VINDALOO: I like this one, but, it's not a must have for most people. The chicken is once again, tender and also juicy this time. However, if you like spicy food, then this one IS a must have. Overall, this is a restaurant that isn't good because of the crappy service which is the worst out of any restaurant in Toronto or in the GTA(that's why i'm giving it 2 stars)and all of the lies of their food. You see, when it first opened, it received acclaim but after 2 or 1 and a half decades later, it's not what it's supposed to be. Maybe in the next year or two, I want to see a better and faster service and no lies on their menu. So, in 2017 or 2018, they need a renovation. And fast. So, as of 2016, don't go to this restaurant AT ALL. Rating:1.5/5(2/5 on Yelp)"}
{"text":"To be honest, this place has excellent food. I absolutely love the Paneer Makhani, Baingan Bhartha, the flavourful rice, and the roti. Only two concerns arise. The first involves the small quantity of the food with the high price tag. While the vegetarian curries are delicious, I'm not too pleased about how little food I get for $11-$15 per curry. I would strongly suggest that the quantity be increased to make $11-$15 per curry worth paying. Secondly, the naan needs to be eggless. Many vegetarians such as myself consider eggs as non-vegetarian. Naan tastes excellent with the curries and to find that it has eggs in it is somewhat disappointing. Other than that, I love this place. The food is excellent and very filling."}
{"text":"Delicious! My mouth salivates for their Butter Chicken as I write this review. Excellent food and good value for price. Great service for both eat-in and take-out options. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been to Bombay Bhel several times now. It has become a weekly lunch tradition for my friends and I. The service is very fast and friendly. The food comes out very hot and the butter chicken is amazing.  They also make the naan in-house so you should order that with your butter chicken in place of rice. The prices are good and you can always get a table. It gets busy but it is a big place. If you want really good Indian food you should definitely try this place. You will keep going back.

{"text":"This is an excellent place for Indian food. It's near the office and I had it a few times on my own and also from office team lunches.   I've tried a variety of dishes and nothing was ever bad. I've had dahl, chicken korma, tandoori, goat curry and the list goes on. The portions are very respectable and each a la carte order can probably fill up 1.5 adults. Meals come with either naan or rice. Get rice or extra naan cause 1 naan is not enough to soak up all that wonderful sauce.  Price wise you are looking at $13-17 per dish. It's more expensive than a lot of Indian lunch buffet but you get quality here. And besides, 1 dish is more than enough for 1 person.   I will come back whenever I have a craving for indian food."}
{"text":"The best butter chicken I've had in a while. Came here for lunch and ordered the butter chicken lunch with garlic naan. Man the garlic naan is good, think butter brushed naan with fried garlic. The butter chicken is awesome. And the lunch portioned is priced appropriately. The butter chicken is tasty and creamy. You gets chunks of real chicken and a side garden salad. Service is a bit slow, so go early or order ahead if you can wheb doing lunch on a weekday. Depending on the day they can be really busy,  or half empty. Luck of the draw I guess.  Will definitely come back when I need my butter chicken fix."}
{"text":"Curries were way too salty (although the butter chicken poutine was surprisingly good and the saltiness of the curry actually worked well with the fries) Naan was bland and overly burnt on the bottom Service was lackluster"}
{"text":"Like this resto for butter chicken, eggplant, tandoori shrimp, vindaloo beef, samosa, pakora, naan  Take out is akways good and filling  Portions are small but seems fair price"}
{"text":"One of the best butter chickens I've had. Docking them a star though because it seems they use a lot of ghee.  PS. If you're dining in, don't order an iced tea to drink. It's not from a can or fountain - they use Nestea powder."}
{"text":"Nice opened environment. The spinach samosas was delicious! However found the food to be on the pricier side, for what you are getting. But to be fair... Indian food in Toronto are generally priced similar, if not more expensive than here.  Will come back!"}
{"text":"This place has definitely become one of my go-to places for Indian food in Richmond Hill! The decor is lovely. Our server was super nice and friendly! Made sure we were looked after throughout the meal.   We got the butter chicken and lamb vindaloo. Both were saucy and delicious. Although I do wish we had gotten the vindaloo a bit spicier. Definitely make sure to add a side of garlic naan to your order as well. It's bomb!"}
{"text":"The restaurant's decor was nice. The food was quite filling even tho, each dish portion was small. Tasted good.  Nice services.  I had chicken tikka masala, curry goat, and papri chaat."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Indian place. Butter chicken is out of this world. Their chaats are amazing too. LOVE!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 4.  Tried some new things, Butter Chicken Poutine & Brie Cheese Pakora.  Loved, loved, loved the Poutine!  Tried Veg & Beef samosas, both excellent.  Finished it off with Mango Paneer (was good but a little sweet for me, but my group loved it) and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Everything was flavourful and delicious.  Service was amazing, server was a gentlemen that made great suggestions, extremely pleasant and patient with our indecisiveness, never felt rushed.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy the Bombay Bhel on Hurontario- do not come here. I frequently visit the other location and am very impressed with the food so we thought we would try this location.. food is completely different and not in a good way. Beef samosa was just big chunks of badly flavoured ground beef in a very hard fried shell. Lamb vindaloo- horrible pieces of lamb, all you can taste is salt. Goat curry- same thing. Overly disappointed, could not have more than 1 bite. Good service but the place is outdated looking, not very clean looking, and bad food."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian restaurant  Love the way the food is served Very tasty food Did not like the naan bread with the potato  Everything was great - including the service"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Indian food here! The service is great as well. I would totally recommend this to anyone who lives close by and is trying to fulfill their indian food cravings."}
{"text":"Came her for an early dinner with family and some family friends.  Décor is really, really nice...customer service is questionable.  We ordered 2 dishes each of dal makhani, paneer makhani and malai kofta along with naan and tandoori roti.  In terms of curries, dal makhani is pretty reasonable, malai kofta was probably my favourite - the koftas are well made. paneer makhani is disappointing - forget about tasting like ketchup, the colour of the curry shouts ketchup...I had very little of it. paneer is chewy - commented on by other members too.  Tandoori roti was dry, very light in weight; Didn't have the naan but other members said it was alright. For the kind of prices that you have to pay, you should expect better quality."}
{"text":"4.5 this place totally hit the spot.  my boyfriend ordered the lunch vindaloo and i ordered butter chicken.  everythibg about the lunch meal was great.  including the service. very pleasent experience."}
{"text":"Bombay Bhel is a great place to go to when you're in the area. Servers provide great service, the food is tasty!  We ordered a veggie platter and butter chicken.  The veggie platter has three different types of dishes, rotti, rice, and dessert. Around $15   Butter chicken came with rice or rotti. Around $11  I would come back if I'm in the area but I already have a place I frequently go to in my area."}
{"text":"My go to joint for butter chicken. One of the best hands down - super soft and juicy chicken with flavourful sauce. I've been to a few Indian restaurants downtown and uptown and still was not able to find something comparable. Be sure to try their garlic naan with the butter chicken.   I have been coming here for years and their service has always been great and they have the friendliest staff.   Ps check in on yelp and get 2 free samosas!!"}
{"text":"My family has been getting take-out Indian food from Bombay Bhel monthly for the past 15 years; I've also dined-in here once.  It's the best tasting Indian food you can get in Markham.  We usually order the Butter Chicken, Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Tika Masala, Amritsari Goat Curry, Palak Paneer, and Tandoori Chicken.  Each entree comes with basmati rice or naan. My personal fav is the Butter Chicken - the curry is pretty much orange liquid crack-cocaine.  Though it's the best tasting Indian food in Markham, it's pretty pricey, so make sure you have enough funds to support your newfound addiction."}
{"text":"Wonderful Indian food and good service. Sometimes it would be nice if the servers were more attentive but that doesn't change the quality of the food. Simply wonderful flavours."}
{"text":"Decent place for Indian food. The butter chicken has great colour and the aloo tikki (fried potato patties with a curried chick pea sauce and a sweet sauce, 3 pcs) has lots of spices and flavour.  I prefer the cheese naan over the garlic, just because it's softer and chewier-- pure comfort food. But both naans are really fluffy and crispy!"}
{"text":"Simply the best indian food in the GTA.  Highly recommend the aloo tikki and the butter chicken.  The restaurant is always clean and the service is excellent.  The owner is  always around to give advice and is a  proper gentleman."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and had the lunch butter chicken which came with rice. I added naan bread for dipping. The meal was absolutely delicious, the chicken was tender and the sauce tasted amazing. Portion was great for lunch and definitely hit the spot. I loved how they package their \"to go\" meals to eliminate sauce spill disaster! Food was ready in time and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"What happened Bombay Bhel?  We usually love coming to your restaurant. Normally, the butter chicken, and eggplant bharta are great but today we are wondering if management has changed or the chef has changed?  The butter chicken was too sweet, the eggplant (even from first glance) did not taste anything like what we had before.  There wasn't any \"smoky\" flavour and it was tasteless. The chicken korma was tasteless as well. Too bad. We were debating between Ambiyan and Bombay Bhel and chose you but next time we will go to Ambiyan. Sad because we actually prefer coming here!"}
{"text":"I was SO thrilled that they opened up this location - I used to get to the Brampton location every now and again and it wasn't often enough!  Their food here is SO good - SO fresh - all their curries are served in little copper pots and piping hot.  Their northern style curries are amazing.  Try the butter chicken if you're a beginner or for more adventurous who like spicey - definitely go for the vindaloo."}
{"text":"My favourite place to come for butter chicken and their fresh nan! Hands down bang for your buck and awesome service! Love this place. Samosas chicken pakora and all the goodies!"}
{"text":"Thaali is worth the time and effort and the money - service is rude, slow and unapologetic."}
{"text":"Still our favourite go to for authentic Indian. Fluffy naan and decent prices. Sometimes the level of spice they use can be inconsistent, but we have yet to find a yummier favourite."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   Hubby and I used to have a favourite \"hole in the wall\" Indian restaurant in East Markham. That is until I took my brother and sister in law there and a roach crawled out from the side of the table. Never again!   Thankfully Bombay Bhel is NOT that restaurant, and it is now our go to place to satisfy our cravings for Indian food. The restaurant is dimly lit, clean, and decorated with Indian inspired art along the wall where a number of booths are located.   We usually order butter chicken with naan (can upgrade to garlic naan for an additional fee). The butter chicken sauce is creamy but not too thick, and I have been known to sop up every last bit of the butter chicken sauce goodness with naan. When are feeling the need for veggies, we order the okra dish, or the aloo gobi (Indian style cauliflower with potatoes). Each dish is served with your choice of basmati rice or naan. Their vegetarian samosas are pretty good too, and are served with a delicious sweet sour tamarind sauce.  The food is reasonable priced for what you are getting, although I find many Indian restaurants' serving sizes to be on the smaller size (this place included). Nonetheless there are few places where I would make a special trip to get butter chicken, and this restaurant happens to be one of them.  (14/100)"}
{"text":"I was turned onto this place but used to eat at the Eglington location which I find to be better, service and quality wise.  I have been to this location over a dozen times and it was always a decent place with spotty service.  However, taking advantage of a Groupon we did a take out run one evening as my kids are starting to enjoy Indian food.  High marks for packaging as they have quality take out containers and have a heat shrink wrap to keep everything from leaking out in your car.  Well i was shocked at how they raised their prices during Groupon and now charge for white meat. $17 for Butter Chicken where you try to find the chicken in the dish is a rip off. They charge an extra $3 for white meat. Who eats dark meat Butter Chicken????  I didn't enjoy the rudeness upon picking up the order and trying to understand the charges and how a take out order was so high even with the Groupon.  I doubt I will be back!  Normally I would rate these guys a solid 3 stars"}
{"text":"The food is good here. Chicken tikka masala is one of the good dishes to try. Just think and its bit overpriced compared to other Indian resturant in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Indian food. I mean, I like curry and what not but that's pretty much it. I think it's the coconut milk that they use or the spices but basically I only like butter chicken.  We came to this place because a family friend of my bf was having a birthday party there and we tagged along. I wasn't stoked by the idea but I'm up for trying new things.   The place is really small, and extremely red, not bright red but a maroonish-red but it was all over the walls. The restaurant is quite small and intimate. There aren't any booths just tables and chairs.  For lunch they have a buffet but for dinner it is a la carte. There is a wide selection of different curries and spices and different degrees of spiciness depending on your palatte. There are a few vegetarian selections for those of you non-meat eaters, I honestly don't know how you live...  I chose the safe butter chicken. You have to order your rice seperate as well as the naan bread seperate. The rice comes on a plate, not in a bowl, on a plate and the small was enough for sharing between 3 people. The naan bread was good, it's a little thicker than Malaysian roti but still delicious.  There wasn't much flavour to the curry. Although, I was ridiculously full by the end, I didn't feel satisfied. The spiciness was nilch even on the super spicy dish that my bf got.   An upside, is they have a liquor license and they serve very rare beers. Beers that they don't sell at the LCBO and are native to India and other exotic countries. They also have wine for those winos out there.  The food wasn't really my style but it was still good and it's a great place for sharing, not sure if I would recommend it for a first date but definitely a 3rd or 4th date, once you've gotten to know each other. You'll have fun taking turns dipping the naan into the curry sauce."}
{"text":"This is one of the top go to places for me to get Indian food in Mississauga.  The garlic naan bread and butter chicken never disappoints.  The Palak paneer (goat cheese with  a spinach) is also another favourite of mine, it does not packed as much flavour but the texture and cheese is good.  The tandoori chicken was also cooked right and flavourful.    If your stomach has space left I recommend getting the masala tea."}
{"text":"The decor is very good, food is good as well. This is a staple feature for Indian food for those who live in the area. Last few times we had been turned off the food since the chole was not good & bhindi is never up to snuff. But they redeemed themselves with an excellent veg-thali with melt in your mouth  daal/makhani. The tandoori paneer tikka was awesome. The milk kheer was sour & spoilt but they replaced it with gulab jamoon which had an old oil smell. Definitely not a place for desserts but food is good. However, the wait for food is long. So if you are really hungry, appetizers will be a good interim.  As for seating, the booths are too low & uncomfortable for tall people like us. Also, the slightest movement from the adjoining booth rocks you! They also run with very few serving staff which leads to long waits for service."}
{"text":"Bombay bhel is my favourite non-buffet Indian restaurant.  I have been coming to this restaurant ever since I was a little kid. They still have the same amazing taste for years. I always grab the chicken thai because it gives you a variety of things to eat. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious bite to eat."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Good service and food. Except for the last visit where we ordered the jumbo tandoori chicken wings and when it came out they weren't jumbo but small chicken wings. The times we went before they were big chicken wings but not this recent visit. It was disappointing and it's not like they gave more wings because they were smaller either. The butter chicken is delicious and the veggie samosas. Mango lassi was good too. I would come back but hopefully next time they would have jumbo wings as its stated on the menu."}
{"text":"Met my fiance here for a late night Indian food fix on December 11, 2012.  This was an excellent place.  We had samosas, butter chicken and lamb korma.  The naan was steaming hot too!  Everything was great and the service was the best!  Very nice lady who answered the phone and me much needed directions.  They are so polite and friendly :)  We will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"I am part Indian and I know Indian food as I grew up eating it.  I can tell you this place is 1/5 - disappointing taste, small portion, terrible value. Avoid"}
{"text":"Came back to try their spiciest curry and also decided to order some other dishes since we probably won't be finishing the curry. Ordered the chicken pakora, tandoori chicken, and a mango lassi. The chicken pakora was not what I was expecting. Ive had veggie pakora before so I thought it would be potatoes, onions and chicken. But it was just deep fried chicken, which was very dry. The tandoori chicken were amazing but for 10.99 I was expecting more than 3 pieces of chicken. Now to the main reason I came back. The spiciest curry was honestly very spicy, I only had maybe a spoonful before my stomach started hurting, definitely underestimated the heat. It was a good experience but it was very flavourless. No seasoning whatsoever it was literally pureed chillies, very bland. The manager came up to our table and actually warned us of the spiciest which I thought was very nice. The service was slightly better than before but I don't think I would be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food. Great portions for the price. Would come again if in the mississauga area."}
{"text":"Great place and great service. Their butter chicken is amazing and Naan is to die for and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I found myself recalling how I found Bombay Bhel, and how it turned from a great restaurant choice to a near addiction for me.  This was triggered by their recent renovation, where the only un-stellar part of the experience was the slightly threadbare and dim interior.  Now the place looks more like an upscale bar, and yet the food quality remains rock solid.  Compared to my previous review (see below), I have become a regular, always ordering the Beef Curry lunch special--outstanding for under $10.  Of course the naan is always delicious, and the tool of choice for getting at every bit of the curry gravy.  Yes, it has become an addiction.  I can tell by the cravings that never let me stay away too long! ______ In the middle of an ocean of Asian restaurants sits a quaint Indian restaurant.  I was introduced to Bombay by a business associate after 15 years of driving past it every day.  It is in the same complex as Go For Tea, Congee Queen and Baton Rouge, so there is a bit of competition.  But to the food:  I ordered a Chicken Thali, which is a nice assortment of  tandoori chicken, rice, naan, daal, raita, papadum, pickle, dessert & your choice of beef or chicken, or lamb for an extra $1.00.  The flavours and sauces were wonderful, which made the incredible fresh naan bread essential to sop up every drop. Just the right heat, tenderness and crispness of everything on the plate made it a great meal for a very decent price.  Although small, this place still competes with the other large upscale restaurants in the complex. I can only imagine the place is packed every lunch hour."}
{"text":"Update: I've changed my review from a 4-star to a 3-star. The food remains as it was (delish) but the service was just terrible. Two of us were there on a Thursday evening for dinner and were completely turned off by the waiter's rude, inattentive service. We waited 30 minutes for our bill after asking for it twice, and he seemed really put out by the ask. A VERY different experience compared to the waiter we had last time. Total bummer.    ------------------------------ Ooooooh so tasty!   We went to Bombay Bhel to satisfy my craving for Indian food. They definitely did that!   At first I was a bit concerned as the restaurant wasn't very busy and ambiance is a bit dated, but we were pretty early for dinner and were seated comfortably in a booth before a number of other tables arrived. By the time we got our dinner, the restaurant was 2/3 full.  If you go, you MUST try the beef samosas. I didn't think they would be good since I'd never had beef in my samosas before, but OMG!!! They knocked my socks off. The pastry was light and flaky and the filling was DELISH. I am still thinking about them...  We tried both vegetarian and meat curries and they were both delicious. They came with huge naan and ample rice that was so soft and fluffy I ate the whole thing, and I don't even like rice.  The service was lovely. The guy who greeted and served us was really nice, attentive and made useful recommendations.   The only reason why it's not a 5-star is the decor and wine selection, but hey...who really cares about wine with Indian food, right?  We will definitely be back.   Seriously...try the beef samosas!!!"}
{"text":"We sometimes go here for their lunch buffet on a Friday. It's just a short walk down from the North York Centre subway stop so it's quite convenient to get to.  The lunch buffet is $11.99 and has all the regular dishes that you would normally find in an Indian buffet. The food, for the most part, is really tasty (their Butter Chicken is fantastic) although I can't say that I'm a big fan of their Tandoori Chicken...  I find it to have an overwhelming flavour of charcoal.  This place isn't much to look at on the inside and I reckon they could do a little work on the outside to give it more curb appeal but the service is friendly and the seating area is well laid out."}
{"text":"food was 4 stars both the chicken tikka masala & beef korma were flavorful w/ a good consistency (though beef could have been more tender)  naan was freshly baked and did a great job soaking up the curries really enjoyed my meal   however, -1 star for both the service & cost  it took 30 mins to get the food & another 10 for the bill  price was also at the high end; 2 small curries w/ naan costed $37 if it weren't for groupon's \"buy $15 for $25 worth\", it's sort of a rip-off"}
{"text":"Went for dinner. If u love thali don't order during dinner time. There was not a lot variety. But butter chicken was  n samosa was . Lil disappointed that thali dish had once 3 item. Where else other places would have 5-6 small dishes. N the price was too high for that item only. But the rest is good.  Would go again to try other stuff.  Friendly n fast service."}
{"text":"Loved the Lamb bhiryani. The butter chicken pouting was off the charts.   Raj, the manager was awesome and looked after us very well. Good was piping hot. The raita took care of cooling down the flames of the bhiryani spices. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Bombay Bhel serves up delicious authentic Indian dishes. A big step up from typical buffet joints, without the high prices. Samosas were particularly good."}
{"text":"They don't know how to make Indian Chaat I don't even know why is the restaurant named as Bombay Bhel... Pani Puri Sucks Dahi Batata Puri Sucks.. Bhel Puri Sucks Ambience is Depressing... would never ever come here...."}
{"text":"I was really excited for Indian food and always liked the chain. I've never been to this Mississauga location.   I had the chicken tikka and lamb korma here. The food was pretty standard. However I feel that I got food poisoning from this place!  To top it all off, the service was terrible as I was constantly asking for more water, and was insulted near the end when they came to insistently take the plates I was still working on. It appears there were people waiting for a table and they'd rather take new business than to provide good service to their existing patrons.   I will not be returning."}
{"text":"So I've had Indian before... This is out of the can Indian food.  Had the shrimp pakora, beef samosas, and butter chicken poutine.   The butter chicken sauce was from a jar or can. The fries were from Costco. The chicken pieces were not tasty at all.  The beef samosa were just ground beef stuffed in pastry. Really? Not even an attempt at spices?  Shrimp pakora was just deep fried battered shrimp.  The only 2 good things I had? Service and the mango shake."}
{"text":"We have tried many different indian restaurants and this one is definately top 2. We had veggie samosas to start which were hot and delicious. For the mains we had chicken vindaloo, baingan bharta (eggplant) and the beef korma. They were all so good! The peices of beef in the korma were so tender and fall apart in the rich sauce. We over ate from how much we were enjoying ourselves. The naan here was incredible. We upgraded to the garlic naan and the way they make it here has so much flavor and its huge!  To make the experience even better we were served by the owner who took such great care of us. He knew it was our first time there so he explained what he thought was good and what foods compliment eachother most. We will definately return no questions asked!"}
{"text":"I really like their food and I have been there multiple times. Their vindaloo, butter chicken and biryani is some of the best in the GTA.   However, the last time I went there I sat on one of the booths and was bitten multiple times by by insects. Almost represented bed bug bites and left scars on my skin for weeks."}
{"text":"Place is clean, we ordered all appetizers, bhel puri, samosa & dhai puri all of them were good, prices were bit on a higher side."}
{"text":"What a Grand Experience!  Not knowing too much about Indian Cuisine, I asked for some suggestions.     Who comes to the table? The owner himself. He asked a few questions about what things I liked. And that was it, Told me what to have, and brought it to me. The Lamb Vindaloo w/ the Garlic Naan bread. and to compliment the dish he brought me a Kingfisher Lager. Awesome, simply awesome.  And tomorrow, I'm going back to try a few more things he suggested."}
{"text":"Best Indian Food around Square One, Mississauga. Everything is order a la carte and not a buffet style location. However, don't be deceived. One $10 curry dish the side of your palm, paired with garlic naan will leave you full and content. The place is clean, spices are not overwhelming when you enter the restaurant, but dishes are still flavorful and robust. I've been at this location time and time again and I can't help but salivate just at the thought of the food!  The texture of the curry is smooth and syrupy, but not watered down. Spices are well integrated and not overpowering. Paired with the fluffy naan with a tang of garlic is the perfect mix. Butter Chicken, meat is not dry. the Baingan Patiala (eggplant) has a creamy velvet texture with a splash of spice at the end. Aloo Gobi (cauliflower) is my vegetarian friend's go-to and has a crispy texture lightly sprinkled in curry. The Dal Makhni (boiled black lentils) is my favorite. The rich sauce stewed with coriander, fresh tomatoes, butter, and a dash of ginger makes me want to follow bite after bite. Did I mention to start off your meal with a samosa? It's not overly fried but the crispy pastry is a fine balance to the silky mains to come.   Service is somewhat attentive. Location is clean and elegantly decorated. Many of my colleagues and I come here for a lunch getaway. Reasonable price for your meal. Would recommend."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Indian restaurants in Toronto. They have the best butter chicken in the world. Mango chicken is one of my favourites. Butter chicken poutine is one of my guilty pleasures. Awesome decor to host friends and family. Gets packed on certain days so you might want to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I ordered butter chicken with garlic naan and samosas on the side, in total with tax this added up to $30 for dinner. Quite pricy for the amount of butter chicken you get but the quality of the dish was amazing! The butter chicken was richly flavoured with spices the chicken was very smooth and tender.   I also loved the samosas normally the ones I order the skin is thick and stuffed with mostly potatoes, but this place perfectly fried these samosas with thin crunchy skin and very juicy and flavourful beef as well! I would order theses again!   I saw that the lunch menu is a lot cheaper, it's the same as dinner except it comes with salad and a regular naan but for less the price! Next time I'll stick with going to lunch here."}
{"text":"Awesome food! By far the best butter chicken I have ever had, and wow, it was amazing. Service was a gong show took 20 mins just to bring us a drink. The beef samosas were delicious ."}
{"text":"Quite pricey for a chiken bryani. Really great customer service, nice people. Food was good to eat. If u need to go there better call in first for a reservation as we had to wait before being seating. Other than that good place to go"}
{"text":"The chicken Tikka is to die for!!  I love this restaurant absolutely great service and friendly staff! A++++"}
{"text":"Service was so so as the waiter was new and knew minimal English . He wasn't able to explain much on the menu. Food was ok as the quality it similar to buffet style. Pricing is high, therefore consider buffet style. Even was a groupon the bill was high. I would recommend this place as it one of three Indian restaurants around Richmond hill but only if host is closed across the street. The host is more experience but a bit better quality."}
{"text":"@BombayBhel #INDIANFOOD #MISSISSAUGABOMBAYBHEL  I went for a catered party - the whole restaurant was booked. The decor was a bit dated and the food was mediocre. I can't write home about the service either. While there were servers walking around with trays of drinks, plain water was a hard find and refills even harder."}
{"text":"I confess that I am not an expert on Indian food.  My Indian coworker and I came to Bombay Bhel for a Friday lunch.  She ordered a Butter Chicken with Rice and I ordered a Beef Vindaloo with Naan, which is a darker curry, I was told.  The vindaloo was delicious, creamy and a tad spicier than medium level to me.  She told me the food was authentic and the spice level was close to what she would make at home.  Further information is that true Indian food has variety of spices but not necessarily hot/spicy to the extent that it hurts your taste bud.  I guess that is the exact spiciness level of my vindaloo then.  The naan was very big in size.  It went well with the vindaloo.    The services was fast.  We had no problem splitting the bill."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a late lunch. What a  nice find! And very close to the hotel. Had Vindaloo w/Chicken. Just the right spice and great flavor. Very fresh and well made. Sweet tea was good, even though I normally do not like sweet tea. Not bad on atmosphere either, for a strip mall location."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Best I've ever received from an Indian restaurant! The staff are attentive and cheerful!   Ordered butter chicken, chicken tikka (dry) and fish tikka (dry). Each dish comes with naan or rice and an additional salad for the tikka so a good bang for your buck.   Everything tastes fresh and the chicken is super tender and juicy. I thought the butter chicken was in a small bowl and wouldn't be enough but it is so creamy and therefore filling (they put a good amount of chicken so it fills you up)   Bombay Bhel will be a family staple!"}
{"text":"Everything is well prepared and of good quality, but as a frequent eater of Indian food, I found it to be on the bland side."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Indian food for the longest time so I chose this location to be my very first.  Restaurant was packed and seemed to be very clean. I thought the decor was very nice.   I really can't remember what I ordered but the pic is posted below. The chicken Tikka (reddish chicken shown) was very dry and wasn't fresh. The goat (brown stew shown) was very nice.   Naan bread was okay so was the rest of the food. I also didn't find the food to be that spicy at all but I'm used to eating very spicy food.  Overall I would say the food was nothing spectacular which is surprising because if I thought if one particular food would knock my socks off it would be Indian food.   Service was excellent, my server was very happy to explain all the different foods on my plate.  I don't think I'll be back as though as I want to try other places. I think I will try Tandoori buffet as I will get to try many different dishes for one price."}
{"text":"I went there after watching great reviews on Google. Looks like they were mostly fake. The food was just average and the service poor. In Mississauga people are spoilt for choices when it comes to Indian food, the food here was just passable. For starters we ordered papri chat and chicken tikka, neither were very good. For main course the kadhayi panner was no good either and the naan was a little stiff. For desert the rasmalai that we ordered tasted exactly like the frozen one that we buy for our home, we strongly suspect that they don't make it in house and just serve the frozen ones.   Worst thing though was the service, while we had still not finished our appetizers they just brought our main course and placed it on the table and left it to get cold. When we asked for recommendations while ordering we were replied in a very curt and disinterested manner. My friend who had asked for water towards the end, never got it. Overall we ended up paying 100$+ for a dinner for 3 for very sub standard food and bad service. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now and every time I go to a different Indian restaurant I end up saying that Bombay Bhel tasted better. I've tried the butter chicken with naan and also the cashew nut sauce with chicken and naan. Both are packed with so much flavor. I can literally drink the sauce its so good. Even when I finish the naan I end up dipping my finger in the sauce and licking it to finish it off. Prices are on the higher side but well worth it. The decor inside is also very interesting. Its hard to describe but it has a dark hotel type of feel."}
{"text":"One of our favourite places to enjoy some savoury indian food.  Very friendly staff and the food is always extremely tasty.  Why is the rating not higher? Service tends to be really slow and often orders are forgotten.  When calling to make reservations, the person answering will confirm that you have a reservation for whatever time requested but wont take your name down, even after asking if they would like it....   If the service could just be tweaked a bit, it would make a significant difference.."}
{"text":"Excellent flavours, at a great location! Unfortunately, staffing let me down.  Ambience: When you walk in, it's a bit of a mishmash when it comes to design and furnishing. We needed a table for 10, and they didn't have any so they combined two round tables and a small table so that is made a shape of a dog bone. This made for very awkward conversations because of the seating. The place is very bright and very loud so I would say it isn't a great place to take a first date.  Staff: The appetizers came quick but our mains took a while. Me, being the luckiest of all, had to ask about my entrée which they said was coming (I am pretty sure they forgot it, since it took twice as long as everyone else's order). Staff were constantly running around but they also seemed to be absentminded, forgetting our food or water when we had asked about them. When it came time for our bill it took forever to get to us, and then it took forever to sort it out when we wanted separate bills). They also had a yelp check in offer that expired last year go, so you can imagine the organizational skills.  Food: I ordered a Beef Samosa to start and a Chicken Korma with a Garlic Naan on the side. The food is what boosts Bombay Bhel's profile. The curry was yummy and rich, the naan was huge (larger than the plates), and there was plenty of meat. I was actually craving more but I was so full!  Maybe I'll get take out next time, but I definitely will come back for the food."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by this place!!! Although it's not exactly the more chic place in Markham, it does certainly serve good food.    We tried the appetizer platter and what I really enjoyed was that the samosa shell wasn't deep fried chunky dough-ness.  It was actually pleasantly flakey.  I also enjoyed their pakoras.  What I really really enjoyed most out of that meal was the paneer makhni.  That sauce was *delicious*.  And if you read my other reviews, you'll know my obsession with paneer cheese :).    Overall, it was a great experience and I would most definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Love the butter chicken in this place. The service is bad, for a glass of water you really have to wait or keep asking couple of times, then after 30 mins you have it!"}
{"text":"I'm here very frequently, and this is by far my favourite restaurant.  Today I stopped by for the lamb korma, and I am also having some okra.  Nobody makes a korma like Bombay Behl!  It's a nice thick sauce that has some very rich deep flavours.    I stopped ordering Kormas years ago at Indian restaurants because most restaurants served pale meat in a lifeless sauce.  Not at Bombay Behl.  They have put a new twist on a dish and made it come alive!  I also often have the lamb chops which are both juicy and tender.  The lamb chops are cooked nicely in the tandoor and served with a little char.  I was not a big lamb fan, but this changed everything for me.  I eat the butter chicken here often which is a perfect complement of salty, sweetness, and creaminess.  All this and they do not use food colouring to get their red colouring.  This place has it all contemporary looks, good service, value for dollar, and friendly people and top notch food.  The music is pleasant in the background and not too loud , and the food is always good and hot.  The Spicing level is always good, because they ask.  There are a lot of seats, so this place is ideal for parties.  I also bring business associates here every week for meetings.  The staff know a lot about allergies.  I cannot eat several different things, and they have always found ways to make sure that I am well fed with many many options.  They are good for helping with nut allergies, dairy intolerances and understand how to prepare gluten free food well.  All this, and very clean bathrooms.  One of my favourite restaurants by far.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to the Bombay Behl in mississauga.  The restaurant is large and suitable for parties and large groups.  The service was very good.  The menu is very large.  I have eaten at most of the Bombay Behl restaurants.  This one is very good.  I had the okra and the curried goat.  The okra was very good.  It was oily, and was closer to the Pakistani restaurants that I have frequented over the years.  The flavours were definitely there and it was beautifully garnished with lots of grated ginger.  The curried goat was very good as well.  It was very flavourful, lots of beautiful touches in a sauce that was well balanced between salts and fats, and beautifully garnished with fresh grated ginger.  I did find however that the chunks were a bit too large, and that the goat could used a bit more trimming or spent a little longer stewing.  I ate it with a fork and knife.  It's been a while since I was served Indian food like this, bringing back the days of my original love for Indian food which was the heavy accents on the fresh ginger as they served it here.    Not bad at all.  I enjoyed the meal and the restaurant is nice.  It looks like it has been here for many years and has stood the test of time."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! They have great lunch deals which are at a smaller portion but are friendly to your wallet. My all time favourite is their butter chicken with naan - it is absolutely amazing, definitely a must try! They also have great service as the server took his time in explaining some unique dishes to us and often checked back with us.   Although the ambiance could improve (I.e. Brighter lights), I still recommend to give this place a try! You'll definitely fall in love."}
{"text":"The best!!  I need not say more. I just wish there were similar restaurants in the east end of Toronto that serve such quality and flavourful Indian food. Worth the drive for us!!"}
{"text":"Did some takeout last night from Bombay. So the food was great but a bit salty. An hour after we were all very thirsty.  I would say that was my biggest complaint.   Sag was great with plenty of cheese. The masala was well done."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch last week with my family and was really looking forward to this place as I had heard it was really great. We all ordered different dishes: the veg. thali, nonveg thali, butter chicken, and saag lamb curry. Overall, the best dish was definitely the butter chicken, it was tasty and had a nice creamy curry. The thali was not that impressive - the dahl mackhani was just average and the goat curry was not cooked well - the goat was not tender.   The naans were nice, fresh, and crispy.   I wish I would have been able to go to the buffet, as maybe I just needed more of a selection of food. Overall, like I said, I wasn't impressed and I'm sure I could have found some better Indian food somewhere else in the city."}
{"text":"We were in the area, starving & craving Indian food so we decided to go here & give it try.  The restaurant is decorated tastefully & is clean. We arrived 15 minutes prior to closing & the waitress was pushy. She was quite unhelpful when asking questions about meal options due to a serious food allergy, even though she was advised of the restriction she really didn't seem to care.  She seemed reluctant to honour the yelp check in deal. The food was good & the portions were well sized. The mango lassi was not as flavourful as I like it but I've had worse. The samosas were not very good according to my firend. The chicken tikka masala was very good,perfeclty balanced. I believe our second dish was the mattar paneer, it was ok, I was happy I tried it but wouldn't order it again. We had to order the rice & naan on the side & both were well prepared.  We ended our meal with a different staff member that was kind & attentive,he pointed out that the young lady was new to the establishment although part of the family. He made up for the subpart service we had received during most of our meal. We had leftovers to take home & were too full to try any dessert plus the kitchen was closed so we couldn't have had any if we wanted to. I think this establishment is overpriced for the quality of food.  Overall,I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"There aren't many good sit down Indian restaurants but this is an exception. Personally, I like this place more than the close by The Host.  Here are a few must try: Amritsari Goat Curry (w/ bone) - the meat was very tender, the curry was flavourful  Butter Chicken - this is a standard, good dish with a good portion of chicken  Korma (beef/chicken/lamb/shrimp) - we either got chicken or beef with this dish and the cashew nut sauce is definitely something different than your regular curry, this dish may not be very everybody because it's very creamy  We got 3 different types of naan. I have no complaints about their regular naan. Their garlic cheese naan was delicious as if you're eating a pizza. However, I was most disappointed with their garlic naan. It was partly burnt and it was still served to us. For the extra price I had to pay for the garlic naan, I expect to not have to throw out any part of the bread."}
{"text":"Consistently good consistently authentic flavours. We are always greeted by the owner who is a lovely guy that stops to say hello or make recommendations. Butter chicken is the best I've ever had. Pakoras and samosas are super. We tried various Dahl dishes are all excellent. Garlic naan is amazing so is the Tandoori. Tasty paneer and masala dishes. This place is great for the family. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Not the best Indian restaurant I've been to. The butter chicken tastes more sweet than spicy... no thank you. The meat was so dry as well. The naan was good on the other hand. Overall, I would never go back."}
{"text":"Our cousin was visiting from California and we decided to take him here for his first Indian cuisine experience.  I didn't really know what to expect as I haven't been here myself.  I just got a couple of recommendations from friends.  Atmosphere:  casual, dim, good for groups because they can put tables together.  I think there was a little holiday party going on in one corner of the restaurant.  Food:  we ordered butter chicken, beef vindaloo, panak paneer as well as cheese and garlic naan.  Aside from the panak paneer (spinach and cottage cheese dish) which lacked a little flavor, everything was delicious!  Beef was tender, the butter chicken was flavorful and the cheese naan was unlike anything I've ever tried!  The portions were good for sharing and we were at a comfortable 'full' level once we were done.  Service:  great!  Our glasses of water were constantly refilled and our orders came out promptly.  It wasn't very busy when we went (Saturday night) so I can't comment on the service during peak hours.  I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"@bombaybhel offers authentic Indian cuisine that does the trick to satisfy your cravings   Savouryand flavourful food dishes that I enjoyed: chicken biryani  garlic and buttered naan  onion kulcha  chicken korma cooked in a yummy cashew nut cream sauce  ras malai soaked in sweet thickened milk and garnished with pistachios For more food related reviews and posts, check out my Insta: @tacobelle._"}
{"text":"I on the other hand love Indian food. I had been to one of their locations in Mississauga years ago and the chaat was very good. We live near this location so thought, hey, why not!   They are very over priced for Indian food. For a leg piece of tandoori chicken its 11.99.....im expecting a lot for that price and didnt get it...that being said, the naan was very good as was the bathura.  We didnt actually try the chaat here, not sure if I will though....."}
{"text":"Was jonesin' for some Indian food and discovered this restaurant by a random yelp search. Decided to give a try based on aggregate positive reviews. We were rewarded with a tasty meal consisting of Tandoori chicken, butter chicken and goat curry.  Very flavourful.   The owner came around to speak with us afterwards.   I did express my concern on the lack of heat (spice). As each persons tolerance is different, owner said they can accommodate by adjusting spice level from 1-10.  I will be dialing it up in my next visit.  :)  Staff are knowledgeable on ingredients used in their food as well."}
{"text":"The most amazing Indian food! Went with a group of 4 and got 2 beef samosas, 1lb of tandoori chicken wings, chicken tikka masala, korma, butter chicken & lamb curry all with naan.  Everything was on point! The samosas were perfectly crispy and full of beef, the chicken wings were deliciously tangy and all the curries were amazingly spiced!  It was the perfect amount of food for the 4 of us (no leftovers), we even had to get an extra piece of naan because it was so good and we couldn't live with ourselves if we didn't finish every last bit. The servers were great and made excellent recommendations. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Run of the mill indian food.  Vindaloo was really vinegary and didn't tasete to me like vindaloo.  Had a nice flavor but defintely nothing special.  The rice tasted like it was made with laundry water.  Just nas-T.  Avoid this place, drive downtown and go to Motimahal."}
{"text":"Time for a new and updated review based on my most recent visit. Bombay Bhel is still one of the best Indian restaurants in and around town, but it is clear to me that either the ownership has changed or both the ownership and chef have changed. The menu has moved things around, a couple of things have disappeared, the Karahi is banished, there is a dedicated lunch menu that is cheaper and offers 3/4 of the quantity of the regular menu, etc. The biggest change is in the actual cooking. The food is still good and above average. I would go back; however, the cooking before was better. This is too bad because the dishes were consistently incredibly good for ten years or so... The Butter Chicken felt too tangy and the sauce was clearly too tomato-based to be authentic. I do not say that based on how a whole tomato was sitting in the small bowl that was the Lunch Menu, but indeed the dish was fifty percent butter chicken and thirty percent regular curry and twenty percent ketchupy. I hope this is not a sign of what's to come. The Vindaloo was hotter than in the past. One of the beauties of Bombay Bhel was the richness of all the dishes. Tomato, onion, curries, spices, onions and other vegetables found themselves appropriately and perfectly into the different dishes, but the food this time was more simplified and less crafty and rich (as opposed to spicy - as mentioned Vindaloo is spicier than before). Bring back the care and richness of the ingredients. I did not like my beef samosa this time. The meat was too ground and slightly bitter. The naan and rice were as good as ever.  They also have a menu item no one else has, which I must try sometime. The menu has a samosa 'spinich' that is probably a Bombay Bhel original. Seriously people, if expecting you to know how to spell English is too much use something called a spell checker.  The décor is still the same as always. The domed partition will remind one of Prince Of Persia if you have played that game on the PS or sat next to your boyfriend while he played it (yes, I know, but the Prince Of Persia actually happens in India). However, a couple of the panels on the wall decoration were falling off this time.  The service was very good. The food arrive promptly, orders taken immediately, polite waiters and water refilled all the time. The waiters expressed their thanks and listened and followed instructions.  I think I will try Bombay Chutney next time. The menu was always identical to Bombay Bhel due to shared ownership and perhaps Chutney has the exact cooking as before."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great beef samosas, and their chutney is great. However everything else on the menu is a bit pricey, like the butter chicken which costs $13. The service was fast and efficient. The theme of the restaurant is like a zen theme, their is a water wall, statues of buddhas and hindu gods everywhere. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"My favourite place / comfort food by far.  I come here at least once a week.  My favourite dish is the chicken tikka masala.  My wife who is vegan loves the channa masala and rice.  Highly recommend it and guarantee you'll end up coming back again and again.  Cheers,"}
{"text":"One of worst vegetarian Indian food i have ever had, being vegetarian and from india i believe have enough knowledge of good food. Tried 3 times and all 3 times had the worst food.  Would rather go and eat frozen veggies than eat here. Would not recommend for Indian food especially for vegetarian food."}
{"text":"I usually come here about once every 2 years and leave with the same feeling MEHHHH.  Our server thought she had a good memory, so she didnt write anything down, but she got the order right... good.. We asked for hot sauce later..... Never came.  Butter chicken is too sweet, beef curry wasnt legit, biriyani was dry and i dont think thats how it should be.  The chicken tandoori was good. Pass on this place and go to Host if you want Indian in that area."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. 2 stars because they have a grill menu, but the food is not good and the service is even worse. The interior is just poor. Not a place i'll be coming to again."}
{"text":"Food was cold, Naan was burnt, my chicken vindaloo was undercooked by 13mins, service was 2/5.  This rating really should be 1.5.  Go across the street to The Host and you will thank me later.  Your welcome!"}
{"text":"The food was great, I ususally get the butter chicken or chicken vindaloo and always enjoy the taste. The service was prompt, I will definitely be returning more often."}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant! Had all the appetizers they were great especially the chat papri and bhel. The kids enjoyed the butter chicken poutine (w/o chicken). For mains we had paneer masala which had an amazing sauce. Navratan korma was also very good. The bindi was also made well. The mango shake was tasty and filling. Raj was a great waiter."}
{"text":"If looking for authentic Indian taste... Then definitely not the right one to try out... they charge for the chutney ... But that's the only thing U would liked in the restaurant..."}
{"text":"Just had the best tandoori chicken I have ever tasted. Combine that with the best butter chicken in Toronto and WOW.  Decor was NICE and clean . Service was friendly and fast"}
{"text":"Food was quite flavourful and service was not the best, but just underneath it. Fried Brie for appetizer is a must, as is the butter chicken for main. They also have some great choices from the tandoori oven. Didn't stick around for dessert because the kitchen closed at 9:30, but we will absolutely return to check out their other items.  Definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"I don't know a lot (read: anything) about Indian food, but we had a friend order and bring an indian feast of dishes from this Bombay Bhel. I really enjoyed everything that we got! I don't really have much to compare it to, but everything was fresh and nothing had any weird bits or pieces in it where you're mid-bite and you think \"w...t...f was that?\" I tried the butter chicken, beef vindaloo, pakoras, a rice/beef dish, fresh and fried naan bread, and a few other items I'm sure I'm forgetting. Everything was very flavourful and for someone who was hesitant to try this meal, I'm glad I did.  The restaurant doesn't open until 1pm on Sundays, but they allowed us to call in our order the night before and had it ready for 1pm when they opened. Pretty nice of them to do that. It's the little things!"}
{"text":"I have been to Bombay Bhel a number of times. I first found this restaurant by doing a search on Yelp in 2013, before I joined as an active Yelp member!  We had a couple of colleagues from India who were helping us out. One was a vegetarian and preferred to eat spicy food. I felt bad that they were living close to our old workplace where there weren't many restaurants. They didn't drive. One evening, I asked if they wanted to do dinner, found this restaurant, and ran the menu by them. They approved, so we headed over there.  They loved the food! I first had the thali that contained chicken. The restaurant has both meat and vegetarian dishes. The food is scrumptious. I ordered the garlic naan and it is perfectly garlicky. I order it practically every time I am here.  Before both of them headed back to India, our team had a farewell dinner for them. They wanted to come back to this restaurant, so we did. Everyone enjoyed the food and great company.  The third time, I had two colleagues from Sweden visiting our department. It seems like a deja-vu situation, but they also didn't have a car. However, they weren't vegetarians.  I offered to drive them to the Toronto Premium Outlet, as they wanted to shop. We had a wonderful time. It helps to split up, come back, and compare what we had all purchased.  We reconvened at the Bay Outlet, when it was still kicking around. I asked if they wanted to come here. Both of them love East Indian food. So, we went there. They both raved about how tasty the food was. Again, the food didn't disappoint. I had the beef biriyani. It was done so well. The beef was tender and flavourful. The rice was perfect.  Since then, I have been back several times for various work-related outings. As you can tell, I love this restaurant and highly recommend eating here for both lunch and dinner.  The parking lot does get busy at lunch, thanks to the Service Ontario a few doors down. However, you will never have issues finding a parking spot.   (6)"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. The food is great. These guys are sharp. Unlike most local desi joints. They serve you water at your table as you're being seated. Food is quick and the butter chicken is to die for. This is my go-to Indian restaurant in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I would have to say that the inside was very nice and the service was good as well.   The food was pretty poor, Chicken Tikka was ok, Seehk Kabab dry as a damn bone, Vindaloo was not spicy Fish Masala was good.   I was rather surprised by the quality of the food as i have heard good things about Bombay Bhel.   Oh well."}
{"text":"Went with a colleague of mine to have some food on a recommendation.  When I arrived, the location was clean, spacious, and a night atmosphere. The staff was friendly and were very helpful in obtaining a seat while I waited. Menus were promptly provided and lots to choose from (sorry, forgot to take a picture of the menu).  I got the butter chicken and some naan bread...... gooood and spicy! loved it. I also tasted my colleagues veg meal with the mata paneer - pretty good.  Definitely recommend! Take a hot date out, you can have some hot food, then some hot (*censored due to me being weird*)."}
{"text":"Overall food was good, service was also good what was disappointing was the condition and state of the washrooms. Restaurant owners should realize how important it is to have washrooms clean,"}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying that I have been to 2 other Bombay Bhel restaurants many times.  I came here to take my family of 5 out for dinner on a Saturday night.  Their heating was not working, so we ended up being very cold the whole time. They didn't play any music in the restaurant and the restaurant was at half capacity, so it was very quiet.  We each ordered a thali. The waiter was helpful and able to take our orders, including some special requests we had. Normally a table is given papad in the same way restaurants typically give a basket of bread. However, we had to flag down a busboy after waiting 30 minutes to be given some.  Our thali took 45 minutes to be served. They gave them to us without the naan, which took another 5 minutes to be served. The portions themselves were less than at other Bombay Bhels. Some of the containers were filled ~60% full, and their reasoning was that \"some customers waste so we don't fill all the way\". Some of the servings were warm, where we would expect it to be hot. The dal was unusually sweet.  When we finished, we asked for a takeaway container to take our leftovers and the busboy gave us attitude.  Overall, we will definitely not come back to this particular location. If it wasn't for us going to Bombay Bhel locations for years we would have not visited another location ever again."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. I would give it a 0 star. Ordered food and waited over 1.5 hrs for main dishes. When asked for an update on status waitress never came back to our table to provide an update. Horrible service. Food never came. We told the waiter we were going to go elsewhere for lunch.  We had 2 apps that they said they wont charge us for when asked for the bill as we were going to eat elsewhere.   What a disappointment as the 4 of us were looking forward to it."}
{"text":"This place has been here for quite some time. I remember when I first came to this restaurant. They have upgraded and remodeled the inside. Their staff is friendly and courteous. The food is just amazing. From the first time until now when I visit, the taste of the food has not changed a bit. It is still just as tasty and fresh. I love the idea that it is HALAL and that just makes it so much more because then I can eat the chicken tikka which is mouth-watering. The bhel puri and sev puri are such tasty appetizers.  This is a must-try for anyone that has not yet been here. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I just came back home from this location.. We assumed it was lunch buffet but they said they don't have buffet today.. and as we were there, we took our time to drive up here, so we said we mine as well eat here, why not? The prices are pretty decent.. usually Indian a la carte can be expensive but not with this place. Everything js reasonably priced. What I had:  Vegetable Pakora - These were so delicious! I love vegetable pakora, for those of you who hate / dislike Veggies.. Try these and thank me later. It's a nice crunchy flavorful veggie treat!   Chaat Papri - I rarely get it but when I have my craving, which today I did.. I have to have it.. Usually when I get it, it is always just 'O.K' but they make it Delicious here, I actually enjoyed it so much I finished it! (I never finish it).  Tandoori Chicken - sooooooo flavorful.. I enjoyed it very much!  Garlic Naan - Light, Tasty and flakey.. I like it  Lamb Briyani - It was good, I which the lamb was seasoned a bit more but the rice carried most of the flavor, so badically all you have to do.. since there is no manuel for this is.. eat the meat and the rice together so the flavors run free! Lol  Butter chicken - This was the least favorite and I Love Butter Chicken!! It was more tomatoey, then creamy and I prefer it creamy. Don't get me wrong! It was delicious, I just wish it had a touch of cream in it but it was a very deep rich, red tomatoe chicken I would call it.. If I ever come here again, I'll try the chicken tikka masala instead.  Customer Service: Amazing! Simple, non pretentious and FAST! The gentleman taking our order didn't have to write down anything. He took our orders like a champ / Boss and didn't mind.. he was very patient and took his time and got All the orders Right! That is what you call customet service.. the only thing I didn't like was when we were taking left overs to go.. they just gave us packaging to pack our own stuff (I packed it all).. I wish restaurants still did this.. it helps, especiallt when we make our minds up of what type of Tip thwy deserve.. either way that man deserved a tip and he got one!   Overall: I recommened and I sure would come here again. I'm full and happy now. Smiley face."}
{"text":"Excellent food, prompt friendly staff. This location is smaller than the Hurontario or Richmond Hill locations. The biryani is excellent (lamb), channa masala is good, and the fish masala is outstanding - a real surprise. The naan is plain, and desserts small. Each entree is enough to feed 4. veggie and meat thali are available for diners who want a lighter meal."}
{"text":"The taste of the food at this place is good and the portion sizes are decent, but not good enough to allow me to ignore the terrible service that comes with it. I arrived when it wasn't too crowded and yet to get any sort of service seemed impossible. I was literally waving my arms around for some sort of attention. No one came to refill our glasses of water or take our order, and I also noticed that they give complimentary pappadums to all their customers, but not to us.  I got extremely frustrated. On top of that the servers finally approached us with a total lack of enthusiasm, as if they were forced to do their job.      I ordered the baigan bhartha, which was good and my brother got the thali. All of it was good, but not amazing. I have definitely had better in a place that also has great service. I don't think I would go here again, unless I here that they have re-trained their staff."}
{"text":"Solid food and good portion size.  Chaat papri seemed a bit pricey but overall menu seemed a bit over priced.  As different Bombay Bhels go, this one is much smaller and service was much slower.  Flavour was there.  Onion Kulcha was not as good and Hurontario and Eg location tho"}
{"text":"Great Indian food. They claim to have the Best Butter Chicken in Toronto and it does not disappoint. Very flavourful and on the sweeter side. We also had the Lamb Vindaloo which is one of their spiciest dish so be careful when requesting a spice rating. The service was great - very friendly and attentive. Recently renovated too. Would definitely be my go to place for authentic quality Indian  food."}
{"text":"Good bhel puri....hard to find a good restaurant for this.  I was in Brampton on business with the Chrysler plant at Bromalea.    My coworker had never been to an Indian restaurant, but had curry before when she went to Japan.  She was skeptical.  She called the \"Japanese\" curry as awful.  Having dinner with me, and me showing her what Indian food was changed her mind on curry.    Her comment at the end was, \"You are correct.  I have not had good curry!!\"  She thought the Bombay fish masala/curry as good.  She also like the murgh masala/makhani."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff.  We ordered some pakoras, channa masala, naan, rice, butter chicken, and bindi sabji.  The pakoras were yummy  - these particular ones had a lot more chickpea in them than onion. The channa masala was a tad watery and tasted like it had been poured out of a can and marinated for a few minutes.  The naan and rice were good (but I was secretly hoping there would be some saffron in the rice).  Butter chicken was good - the chicken was tender (on another note, I find it really hard to mess up butter chicken - only once have I had a bad one.)  The bindi sabji was fantastic.  Pan fried and delicious with the addition of the potatoes.    Although it is a chain, I prefer the cooking at the Bombay Bhel at Hurontario than this one."}
{"text":"Bombay Bhel is a popular spot around the North York area along Yonge Street... the reason, Indian lunch buffet.  Now I have been here a few times for their lunch buffet, but never for their dinner.  So please take that into consideration as you're reading this entry.  The place is decorated well, but nothing special.  So you won't be coming here for the decor nor will you be turned away with its shady environment.  For this visit, I came here for a very close co-workers goodbye lunch and we had a table of 12 on a Friday lunch.  Make reservations if you can.  The lunch buffets had a variety of Indian dishes, as well some a little more common/Westernized for its customers.  There was probably around 20+ dishes different choices.  I would like to say that this total included appetizers, mains and dessert.  So did it have major variety?  No, but it did include some of the main stables for an Indian buffet.  They had vegetarian offerings such as palak paneer as well as some stables such as butter chicken, biryani and tandori chicken.    Now I'm a major meat eater at any Indian joint I head to.  And yessss, sounds completely horrible but I'm a major butter chicken fan.  Doesn't matter if it's with naan or with rice, I will eat that stuff up QUICK.  I'm pretty okay with most Indian dishes as I have too many friends who love Indian, so after a while you know what's good and what's not.  Now, I was starving and work was... \"interesting\" so my sense of adventure was totally destroyed.  I went heavy on the butter chicken.  So how was it you may ask, it was... solid.  I didn't find it special or bad, the flavour was there as it was sweet and creamy to my liking.  However I did feel that some ingredients were missing to dish as a whole.   From all dishes I got, theme was really.. just solid.  Nothing stood out but I do have to give it up to them as they were always filling up the buffet dishes, water and there were never a shortage of any dish.  And trust me, limited naan is a bad bad things for an Indian lunch buffer.  It didn't happen at this visit.  Overall, I can't say I liked it nor that I hated Bombay Bhel.  It's an okay lunch bufffet, the price can be a little higher than the norm but still even with that in mind, I can see myself coming back.  The service was good and the place is laid out well.  I found the environment better than some of the cheaper lunch buffets that some might compare Bombay Bhel to.  So it's a little classier... not by much, but if I was downtown for lunch, I wouldn't be back.  I'll leave you all with that."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Indian food spots in the area! The service is great and the staff is always friendly! The is consistently good and there is a lot of variety to choose from whether you are vegetarian or a meat lover! I usually order the Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, Tandori Chicken and Naans(A MUST HAVE)!!  The decor and presentation of their food is pretty good as well!  Would recommend this place for anyone who enjoys Indian food!"}
{"text":"I am very surprised that the food here was awful, given the location.  This part of the GTA has such a large Desi population, I incorrectly assumed that bland and spiceless Detroit suburb grade food was not on offer.  WRONG!  Chicken was indercooked and under spiced, yet still tough.  The dal could have come from a tasty bite bag, and the Naan was over cooked.  Upside?  the service was prompt.  Next time, I will go back to the Dundas and Hurontario area."}
{"text":"I have been there few times. They have good food while the customer service is not that good. The hours is a little odd, they close 9pm. I had Palak with lamp and nan which was very tasty."}
{"text":"The food is alright, been here a total of 4 times for lunch, ordered their vinaldoo and butter chicken and every time the meat was always super over cooked, dry and tough to eat. Flavor of the gravy wise, it was great, but with over cooked meat it all falls off. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about their menu."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the food is always excellent, and more importantly very consistent. The potion size, taste, and quality has been the same every time.  Their samosas are delicious! Even many item that I have gotten has never disappointed.  The only downsides I have encountered is that parking is horrible. The restaurant is in a plaza that is always busy. It is not always easy finding a parking spot. The other is that service can sometimes be a little slow. Takeout has always been very quick, while dining in has sometimes taken a little longer then expected."}
{"text":"When I want to get my Curry-On, I usually end up at Bombay Bhel Thornhill.  I use to luv this place.  Not sure what has happened over the last year. My main dish that I order at all Indian places is Chicken Tikka Masala and it was a poor...poor...poor pretender to what it use to be.  It was red and ketchup-y (see pix) and it was watered down.  QQF!?! The beef kabob was dry and the Samosas were oily.  I always loved the Beef Samosas in the past but I don't know what has happened!?! With so many great Indian places popping up east and west of here and even in mid-town, it will be a struggle for me to come back here. All the luck to them. Cheers."}
{"text":"We came here with a large group of family on a Friday evening. The staff was very accommodating of our group, especially since we arrived at different times.   All of the food was all delicious, but the paneer tikka was A-Mazing!! Best paneer I've ever tasted. I had to stop myself from eating more because I knew we still had several courses coming. Do yourself a favour and order it! yum yum yum."}
{"text":"Great lunch place for work. We had a big group & they accommodated all is us. Lunch specials are good portions & love their butter chicken and tikka masala with naan.  Great value & we all enjoyed it. Service was excellent as well considering we were a large group."}
{"text":"Make the commute from Mississauga weekly.  Excellent food and amazing service.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Butter chicken was ridiculously sweet & inedible.  Price was way too high ($20 after taxes) for one dish!"}
