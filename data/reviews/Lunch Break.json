{"text":"Had the Cobb salad and it was the perfect amount of food and balance of ingredients. They are quick with your order and the staff is really nice. I'm glad I found this spot!"}
{"text":"This place is close to my work, so we eat there quite often. Today we had a to-go order and it was a bit late, so I called. They were super busy, so I drove down to get it. I could tell it had been a crazy day, yet they were all still smiling and being more than gracious to the customers. Because of the wait time for our order, the owner offered some free sides...very much appreciated! In addition, when I got back to the office, our order was perfect and the food was delicious as ever! Lunch Break is the spot to be...consistently good food, consistently good service and a fabulous atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Just finished my breakfast sandwich and it was PERFECT. My co-worker enjoyed his sandwich so much he ordered another one. Great vibes. Great people. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Ok so this is long overdue.   This place is amazing! I order from here anywhere from 2-4 times a week and they are always on point with everything! Not only do they remember all the small details of my order, but they deliver promptly! I get the #10, and a bagel and it's always satisfying and delicious. The ham they use is amazing! The owner and all the people who work there (I believe it's family owned and operated but I'm not sure) are super nice and catering! There are occasions I actually go in and eat instead of ordering, and it's always superb. Friendly, fast, delicious! Best part is, I live one block away!!! Keep it up and thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here fot the number #23 and the patato soup. I like it a lot. Bee boo baa baa boo"}
{"text":"First timer at this place.  Food was great, budget friendly, great customer service,  clean location! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I signed up on Yelp just to post about Lunchbreak. Even though their coffee and breakfast burrito are my favorite, I have never had an un-tasty meal from these guys. Definitely can't go wrong with the buffalo chicken wrap, italian meatball sub or chef salad. Very prompt deliveries!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! One of those places you can never say no too! I get the croissant delight, and it is so fresh and delicious. Very friendly staff and the wait for food is not long. A little more expensive than a Subway but it's worth it."}
{"text":"A very good deli.  Great selection of lunch items.  There isn't much else to say but good food and a good atmosphere.  The price is a little high but it's worth it."}
{"text":"If you work or attend school in this area, this is a great regular place to eat! Great salads, soups and sandwiches. I was visiting from out of town, and my friend took me there to eat (this was my second time). I had a cajun grilled sandwich (panini style). It was really tasty! This is a wonderful alternative to the fast food junk that's popped up in this area. I would def recommend you give it a try. If you're in a hurry, they encourage phone orders too, and per their menu, they also have delivery service.  Atmosphere is clean & neat with a bit of vintage flair. Prices are VERY reasonable for this type of deli food (and way cheaper than a value meal at the fast food joint, and probably less fatty and greasy too).  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: In response to my negative review, Amir (better known as the bald jerk off) took it upon himself to demonstrate exactly what a business should NEVER do, which is make the customer experience even worse. Take a look at the private message he decided to send me last night and you will see just how much this company cares about making sure you have a positive customer experience...   \"First off I put a rush on your sandwich to get it out asap, I was pissed off that we didn't get your order. (It doesn't happen to often) I even told my sandwich maker when you left I think you were pissed off. Second none of the employees knew you had an online order so what do you want from us to bow down to you? We serve over 200 people a day we don't have time to sit there and apologize to you were very busy. So overall we are sorry that you had a unpleasant experience and we will use this as a learning experience. And last thing I'd love for you to call me a bald jerk off to my face because I'd personally fuck you up.\"  smh. If I were the owner of this company I would be embarrassed that someone like Amir worked for me. Amir if your reading this, try to remember that your time would be better spent by taking a minute to apologize and show empathy to your customers, instead of threatening them over Yelp.  My original review:  \"Ordered from this place online 20 minutes before showing up to pick it up. When i arrived not only was it not done, they didnt even have my order at all. Didnt print it out. And to make it worse, the bald jerk off who runs the counter didnt apologize or show any empathy whatsoever. None of the employees did. This place has TERRIBLE customer service. Never again.\""}
{"text":"I'm from Denver, travel the Phoenix area for business and came across this incredible little deli.  The food and service are amazing at a very reasonable price.  I will be back on my next trip here."}
{"text":"I work in this area and we order from Lunch Break all the time.  No one who works here has ever had a complaint about any of the food.  I absolutely am a fan of the Grilled Buffalo Chicken Wrap.  The French Dip is delicious, too.  We've had their soups, salads, everything but breakfast.  They do deliver, which is wonderful, especially in summer, and I believe it is only a $1 delivery charge.  When I have been there in person, the man in charge there is extremely friendly and personable.  You can also get a punch card, so your 10th sandwich is free, if you dine in or pick up lunch.  Prices are reasonable and I just can't say enough about how good this place is for lunch, especially in this area."}
{"text":"I recently switched jobs and the thing I miss the most about my last job I'd Lunch Break! The #99 is seriously the best sandwich I have ever had (although I get it without turkey and bacon). Everyone who works there is awesome too and they all knew me by name. I miss you guys!"}
{"text":"Lunch Break is a great place to enjoy freshly prepared food, at a good price, with the best service I've experienced in a long time directly from the owners.   The location is convenient with clean facilities and comfortable indoor and outdoor seating.   It's great to find a family owned restaurant that really focus on taking care of their customers and while making quality food. What a great alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"The highlight of Lunch Break (and frankly, the only reason I'd go) is the convenience to this business district for lunch.  They have breakfast too, which I've been meaning to try, but so far I can only review lunch.   The sandwiches, side salad, and chili are all good.  I haven't had anything that's changed my life yet, but no disappointments either.  \"Good\" food.  But for the price, I'd expect great.  By the time you add a small drink and a side (potato salad, chips, cookie, etc) you're probably going to spend $10.  At lunchtime, I go almost anywhere else and either spend half that, get twice the food, or get seriously superior food that I can sit and enjoy.    I'm not really sure why it tends to take them so long to get food out.  I believe they make their sandwiches when they're ordered, which is good.  And they tend to get very busy at noon for obvious reasons.  But still!  I went in just for a side salad one day, trying to save the other $6.  I'd assume they have those pre-made in a cooler (if they don't... they should!) and it's not a complicated enough salad to warrant 10 minutes to assemble.  I asked about the price of chips on their own, and it was over a dollar for a bag.  If I got just the salad and hit up the vending machines at work for a drink and chips, I'd save about $3 more.  And I thought the vending machines were overpriced.  The outside seating is nice during good weather, and the tables inside are cozy.  I like the decor.  The cashier (the only employee I've interacted with) is always friendly.  Overall, I have no real problem with Lunch Break, I just think it's a little bit expensive and slow for what you get."}
{"text":"This place has very good food for lunch. I have had several items and all are very good. The only draw back is that it is a bit on the expensive side for lunch but you do get better quality food than a fast food place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just started work in the area and wanted ti meet for lunch and had no idea where to go.  We yelped this place and I'm thankful we did.  The parking is a little different and the location is a bit hidden but it's delicious and not overwhelmingly busy.  The people that work here are friendly and welcoming.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"it takes a little while for them to make sandwiches.. sometimes 20 minutes. The wait is worth it. I just call ahead and get it to go. I highly recommend the southwestern chicken panini. Very friendly staff, and off the beaten path makes for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Nice little lunch(or breakfast) spot, offers delivery within the area, super friendly service. You'll find a wide variety on the menu and food is good. Thumbs up! I recommend the jalapeno hummus. Good food, awesome peeps!"}
{"text":"If you are working nearby, this is a great lunch spot, but not worth driving out of the way to locate.  This place is located in an industrial park and you would never find it if your GPS didn't direct you here.  After reading the good Yelp ratings, we decided to try something new/non-chain for lunch, and my coworkers all seemed pleased.  They have an array of fresh sandwich choices including hot sandwiches, paninis, wraps and traditional cold sandwiches.  Their soups are quite good too.  NOTE:  They have a half-sandwich and soup combo deal, but it is difficult to locate on their menu, so ask for it.  Staff is friendly, and the food came out quickl, and all of my coworkers seemed pleased with their lunches.  I really enjoyed teh Southwest chicken wrap with corn, red peppers, jalapenos, chicken, and tortilla chips for the crunch.   The breakfast menu looked tempting as well.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Love this mom and pop lunch deli. Very friendly, great food and wonderful service! You can order online, over the phone or in person. Small dining area but the turn over is quick."}
{"text":"Oh man this place is sweet! Lots of great options, I wish I came with 5 other people to share food! I got the #99 & love it"}
{"text":"Nice change to fast food for lunch - or breakfast.  Check out this place if you live or work in the area.  They're open 7am-2:30 M-F.  I had a delicious bbq chicken wrap that was grilled.  Husband had a delicious pastrami on rye since it was the special of the day.  We got our food to go but they have plenty of seating inside and a nice patio area.  You can call ahead your order, order online or get delivery.  The gentleman who helped us (the owner?) was really nice and I love that when we left, he said, \"See you next time\"."}
{"text":"Best sandwich # 21 California for lunch and  for breakfast love their burrito I definitely recommend \" Lunch Break\""}
{"text":"It's amazing how easy it is to overlook reviewing places you frequent - just was headed to lunch and wondering what reviews said about The Lunch Break.  Surprised to find no reviews (however, it is off the beaten path for most I think - more of an industrial park breakfast and lunch stop).  The Lunch Break is just that - a small breakfast and lunch spot tucked into an industrial park.  The current owner, Darryl, has worked hard to improve the menu and facilities.  He has added tasty hot sandwiches and expanded their patio to be more comfortable on those nice days.  It's one of those places that if you frequent enough they will greet you by name (I frequent so often, and order the same thing so much that they sometimes have it made and ready before I get to the front of the line!).  Definitely a recommend for an easy/quick lunch without eating fast food.  Good sandwiches and salads!"}
{"text":"I woke up Thursday and wanted a Cobb salad so I yelped Cobb salad and this place popped up.  The salads are fresh and made to order. The ingredients are fresh and delicious. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I discovered this place a couple of weeks ago on yelp, and am so thankful I did! It has now become my go to place on days I don't bring lunch, and every time I am beyond satisfied with my food. The gentleman behind the counter is always so friendly, and my food is always ready when i call ahead, or made very quickly if I order at the counter. The chipotle sauce or chipotle mayonnaise is the BEST! I believe they make it in house, because it has so much chipotle flavor, and even chunks of the chipotle peppers, which I LOVE! The bacon was perfectly crispy for the BLT, and the ingredients are always fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"I have to update my review, because the more I visit Lunch Break, the more I enjoy this really great hole-in-the-wall for lunch!   They have gotten significantly quicker at processing orders. Even during the really busy hour of the lunch rush, I never have to wait more than 5 minutes or so to get my order. They have a great, extensive menu with SO many options... And hands-down, the BEST soup! I have not had or tried a soup I did not like. They all taste and have the quality of home made and it goes perfect with their half-sandwich combo. Same with the macaroni, potato & pasta salads. Pretty much everything is really good!   The staff absolutely recognizes you and knows you by name after a few visits. They are a great bunch to see on a regular basis and the environment is pleasant. I really like their rewards thing, too- after 10 visits, you get $5.99 off your next visit. Much appreciated to get a free meal every so often!   Asking for no tomatoes is still a hit or miss. Usually a hit because it seems that small request is only missed during really busy times for the kitchen staff. But I love this place and their great quality of fresh food & superb customer service!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of addicted to this place. My work is located in the business park down the street and I eat here too often. (probably 2 or 3 times a week)  The prices are fair and the quality is much better than what you'll find at the chains near it like Quiznos or Subway. I pretty much get the same sandwich every time, but I've tried a few and they are all good which one exception--I'm looking at you 'chicken parmesan sandwich.' I usually love those, but theirs is awful, almost borderline inedible. The chicken is clearly microwaved and frozen (so it's very chewy, and very grisly.) I gruelingly ate it, but it's back to the sandwich I usually eat.   Overall it's 'good,' not 'great,' but good, better than fast food and other sandwich chains."}
{"text":"This was an amazing find!  We just happened to be nearby at the Walgreens and stopped by to grab a sandwich on the way back to work.  Very reasonable prices and a large menu selection.   I had the chipotle chicken wrap and I was not disappointed!  Huge portions- very spicy as advertised and very fresh ingredients.  Would highly recommend plus they deliver!"}
{"text":"Lunch Break is my go to lunch spot... and not just because it's 2 minutes from my office.  The people are always friendly and the food is always delicious. They recently got a new soda machine and ice machine. Their menu has a new look. If you haven't been to Lunch Break in a while, you should definitely go!"}
{"text":"For a small lunch only restaurant, you can't ask for much more.  Great food, fast, good prices, and they deliver for a small fee.  They also have hot food like pasta if you don't want a sandwich, and salads if you are health concious.  Definitely adding it to my list of places to visit once a week."}
{"text":"Lunch Break is a nice little place for a quick lunch in the South Phoenix area off of 40th street.  They have sandwiches, wraps, salads, and soups that is always fresh food with a nice variety. The owners are extremely friendly, they are always willing to try new sandwiches on their menu. Their menu offers chips, macaroni/potato salad, cottage cheese and yogurt as sides to the combo. Prices are very reasonable.  They also have breakfast here, i have never tried but it is on my list :)"}
{"text":"Although the location might surprise you on the edge of an industrial plaza, don't let the food fool you. REAL sandwiches, REAL meat that tastes like lunch meat and good portions. Prices are very fair considering the quality of their food, a little more cash than a $ubway, but the taste more than makes up. One of the biggest attractions for me, SOUP, SOUP, and SOUP they have daily soups which I have not found one yet that I have not liked. Only negative comments would be regarding their chili and parking....too plain, too thin, almost like soup, but did taste good. They have a small parking lot with wierd access, wld recommend parking on Roeser Rd. I would def recommend this place for Sandwich and Soup. Small groups ok, location inside is rather tight and small, especially during lunch hour on weekdays."}
{"text":"We were in the area and needed a quick lunch. This place was an answer to our prayers. Great fresh salads!!"}
{"text":"Lunch Break is my favorite lunch spot! This place has the best sandwiches and salads .  The food is always fresh, the staff is extremely friendly, and I never have any regrets when I go there.  The place has a nice atmosphere with outside seating that I take advantage of whenever it's nice out! I would recommend that if your in the area to stop by and try anything on the menu; you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Lunch break has the best food! Whenever I order, it's always consistently good! You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. The place is clean and the food is always fresh and made to order. The owners are really sweet and care a lot for their customers happiness. It's hard to find people like this! The prices are very reasonable and you get a lot of food for what you pay for! Can't recommend this place enough! Go and enjoy it for yourself, you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Nice little hidden gem that I feel a lot of local business people go to for a quick but delicious bite to eat. When I say bite I say generously sized sandwiches. I walked in about 15 minutes before they closed(no I'm not usually that person but I was getting hangry and knew I was going to be stuck in traffic). I was greeted by a friendly older gentleman, gave me some time to look since I was a first timer. I went with the croissant delight. I'll put it simplistically: club with avocado and sprouts on a crossiant=absolutely yummy!  I had given my father a piece of it since I couldn't eat all of it and he to would vouch for them. I'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"My co worker told me about this place last week and I've been twice since. Food is delicious and fresh, staff is fast and friendly and the prices are great. Good portions, large selection of choices, really nothing not to like. Just became my favorite lunch spot to frequent"}
{"text":"A nice little find  Lunch Break is located in a business park in a part of town I was unfamiliar with and not having a lot of time to drive around looking for a lunch spot, I took the  recommendation of a co-worker and stopped by \"Lunch Break\" for a bite.   I have to admit, I have been told on more then one occassion that I can be like \"Joey\"  from the show  \"Friends\" when it comes to my sandwiches. So, I was a little apprehensive when we stopped at Lunch Break, however I'm so glad we stopped because I was pleasantly surprised.  Lunch Break offers a large selection of sandwiches, wraps, salads, drinks, and deserts. Lunch Break offers great lunch specials.  You can get a sandwich and your choice of potato salad, pasta salad, cole slaw, or chips.   Today, my lunch companion and I had the Chicken Parmesan on Panini Bread, and  tuna salad on sourdough.  Both our sandwiches were  fantastic and the potato salad is some of the best I ever had.   The price is right, the sandwiches are big and the staff are friendly. If your in the area give Lunch Break a try.  Expect great sandwiches, salads, soups, desserts, and the best customer service."}
{"text":"Came here in the afternoon and wasn't a long wait at all. Good selection in their menu with variety of food. Customer service is friendly. Ordered a burger and some fries. It was very tasty and flavorful. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My family and I are from Indiana and decided to stop before we had to catch our flight and we were highly satisfied. Very friendly, family-owned, and healthy food. The menu is large and has so many different types of sandwiches (hot or cold), wraps, croissants, paninis, and more. Would recommend if you want a healthy lunch for reasonable price and quickly!"}
{"text":"This is a small place that is easy to miss but work the effort.  The deli appears to be run by a couple. Very friendly. Lots of sandwich and salad options on the menu board. my southwest chicken salad was very good and only about $8. Freshly brewed iced tea."}
{"text":"I love this little place!!! Very close to my job, we go there 2 - 4 times a week.  I love the veggie wrap, salads are amazing.  Recently had the Croissant delight minus the bacon and  it was fabulous.  Who would have know a hole in the wall such as this would be so amazing.  Get there early cuz they do start to get busy.  My only complaint - why are you not open on weekends :)"}
{"text":"Always a great sandwich to be had at The Lunch Break. Breakfast burritos are a great way to start the day as well."}
{"text":"I love Lunch Break! Hani, Aida, and Amir are great people and do a great job every day. Myself and people from our company eat there weekly. They deliver friendly service and great food as well! For a small place in an industrial complex, they do a surprisingly great job! We will continue to support them and tell people how much we love them!"}
{"text":"This is in walking distance from work which is awesome. It's a great place to grab a fresh sandwhich, salad or wrap and they'll change things up on the menu of asked. Honestly I'd come here just for the service, everyone that works here is super friendly and I love going in there to say hi and talk to them. So far my fave is the #99, but on sourdough bread... So yummie!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, better service. The staff called me back after having trouble finding the place, just to make sure I could locate it. An extensive yet appropriate menu. Reasonable prices. The owner even brought out homemade jalapeño hummus with pita bread for us to sample (on the house). I'll be back."}
{"text":"Refreshing little mom and pop's deli shop. Food is fresh, delicious, and generous at a fair price. I will be returning to this deli on many more lunch breaks in the future."}
{"text":"I Love going to this place!! I work in the area and started coming for lunch and now I go all the time. I even started coming on my days off because this place is worth it!   The owners are very involved and their food is fresh and authentic and the service is always good. There is a variety of options to choose from so there is something for everyone! My favorite is the Greek chicken salad sandwich, I order it all the time because the chicken is so tender and they give big proportions. But I've honestly had most of the menu items and everything is tasty! You really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for lunch over the past five years or so. Have never had a bad meal! My fav is the chipotle chicken salad wrap. Unless you order the combo special of the day, meals can get expensive if you add a side and drink. That's the only thing keeping me from coming here for lunch every day."}
{"text":"What a great little sandwich shop hidden away in a business park. Everything is made fresh and you watch them make everything? right in front of you. Not a bad sandwich on the menu! They also have a wide variety of salads and wraps. And it is very vegetarian friendly. A must try!"}
{"text":"Everything I have tried has tasted great! I work right around the corner so I go frequently. Just changed my review as the owner makes everything right. Just some confusion. EVERYTHING is good! Prices are good too! Glad this place is around the corner."}
{"text":"Just like the name says, it's the perfect place for a lunch break. I love the croissant delight and the pasta salad."}
{"text":"Great family owned place, the food is good. I typically call in my order and it's ready for pick up in minutes. I would recommend the breakfast panini."}
{"text":"Very solid panini and I didn't feel gross after eating it. Chocolate chip cookie was also hella soft."}
{"text":"Hidden Jem! This place makes the best BLT sandwich. They offered delivery too. The owners are friendly and food is prepared quickly. So lucky this cute little spot is less than a mile from work"}
{"text":"The croissant delight is a must and love how they use sprouts instead of lettuce. Great quick affordable lunch"}
{"text":"If a simple, fresh quality lunch at a reasonable price is what you are looking for, look no further than the Lunch Break.  The restaurant is a bit off the beaten path, but relatively easy to find with Waze or any other GPS app.  On my last visit I tried the BBQ chicken wrap and was impressed with the fresh delicious ingredients they used.  The wrap was also stuffed to gills with chicken.  I hate places that make their sandwiches look big, only to take a bite and find them filled with too much lettuce or other fillers.  The restaurant has some nice outdoor seating for when the temps are comfortable.  If it's too toasty outside though, they have plenty of tables inside along with a large screen TV to watch.  All and all Lunch Break is a great change from the bland chains and well worth a try for lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"I work nearby and love supporting local business by coming here! Sandwiches are always super fresh, which I love. I also like how many choices there are on the menu. I usually get a turkey sandwich with a side of chipotle sauce, but my coworker has gotten a variety of the wraps and always finds them to be delicious too."}
{"text":"Lunch Break's food is always fresh, tasty, and so far my experiences have been that they have my order ready in a timely manner. The customer service here is FANTASTIC, everyone that works here is very sweet - the kind of place that definitely develops a relationship with their regulars. I started going here because it is near my work and have found that I now crave those veggie sandwiches on the weekend which means I do my best to get my fix during the week. :)  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what most people are raving about. Lunch Break is somewhat inconvenient considering their location. They're tucked away in a strip of commercial buildings. It's a good place for a lunch break if you work around the area. The place is a small sandwich shop that can seat around 25-30 people.   The text size on the menu is extremely small and difficult to read. It's very hard to read especially when you're lining up by the entrance. I ordered the panini thinking it's a simple sandwich to prepare. I was wrong. I watched the six customers behind me get their meals before I did. Not sure if they were using a luke warm panini press or a clothes iron but it did take a long time. My coworkers finished their meals when I finally received mine.   Heat up the panini press guys. I'd rather eat with my coworkers rather than watching them eat and then having them watch me eat."}
{"text":"Three years ago, my work was located in one of the many business parks near Lunch Break.   More like, you could throw a rock and hit this place... Kind of!   So if you work in this area, you know there's not too many options for lunch.   Lunch Break had some of the best breakfast paninis ever.    Fluffy eggs, buttery toasty, thick slices of bacon and cheddar.   Definitely not good for you, but oh so good!   The veggie wrap and buffalo chicken panini with celery and bleu cheese also made for a great lunch.   Highly recommend giving this place a try if you work in the area and need to escape the daily grind for a minute!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't go out of my way to check this place out. In the event that you're in the dirty south of Phoenix... You may want to check it out if you're in the mood for a sandwich shop that has much more flavor than Subway"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since this little sandwich spot opened years ago. It's now on it's third owners and they have made some big improvements. It was great before as my go to place for a sandwich on the way to work. Now it's even better with a wider variety of foods that includes Hummus (yippie) and breakfast items.      They still have my favorite Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Tomato and Lettuce/Sprouts on a Croissant and the Roast Beef, Bacon with BBQ sauce on a Whole Wheat Roll along with a big selection of new delicacies. I still love their potato salad. So yummy.       They even do some nice breakfast foods that are far better than anything at a fast food place.        If you work in the area or are just passing through, this is a great place for a good lunch."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. If you didn't know what you were looking for, this place can be easily missed. There's a small side up front but hard to see. I accidentally found the parking in the back but it was nice that they had a few slots specifically for them. Got there around noon and the line moved pretty quick. There's a big selection of hot and cold sandwiches as well as salads. I opted for the hot pastrami sandwich. The food came out quick but my hot sandwich was more warm. Compared to other pastrami sandwiches, the one here was ok. The best part of this sandwich was that the meat was thinly sliced and very tender."}
{"text":"Quick fast, tasty and very reasonable prices.  Glad I found this joint, it's so close to my work. I've had their salads, the Chef salad is big and filling. Their Reubens are tasty.  I've had the Reuben twice first time it was off the chain, the second time the meat smelled a bit gamey, but I ate it anyway. Could have been the end of the line for that meat, and needed to be tossed out. But what don't kill me only makes me stronger.  I'm glad to have found this place."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!! We were on vacation looking for a light lunch, something other then  a subway! We found Lunch Break on Yelp.  Great menu, Great service! Great food!They had a hot sauce on the table that was to die for. I asked the order taker ( who I think might have been the owner) if they sold the hot sauce, he asked if we liked it. He proceed to give us a bottle at no charge. The service was very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Location: The restaurant doesn't look like a restaurant from the outside. I mean, it's in an industrial area in an imendustrial building. May be a bit hard to spot, but nothing a GPS can't help with.   Service: At first glance, it didn't seem like much. But when I ordered my food, the owner (at least I think he is) gave me a free chocolate chip cookie. That was because I got confused about how their lunch combos worked and he offered me a cookie along with the chips I chose. The rest of the staff is also really friendly. +1 because I'm a sucker for chocolate chip cookies.  Food: I ordered a cajun turkey panini (#21), my brother ordered a Caesar Salad w/o chicken, and my dad ordered a California Chicken Sandwich (#7).  For the panini, I love how thin they sliced their tomatoes. I didn't taste much of the cajun flavor, but overall I still enjoyed it. My brother said that the Caesar Salad isn't the best he's ever had, but it's definitely above average. Dad also enjoyed his sandwich (no idea why though).  Overall: In all honesty, I would give the food here 4 stars, but I HAVE to give an extra star for that free cookie. Got to have my cookies!"}
{"text":"Not what we expected.    It is within the industrial area.  The food was just the same as any other typical deli places."}
{"text":"Other than the text on the menu being a little hard to read because it's so small (understandably so there's a lot on it! So many options) & parking being sparse, I have no complaints.  The restaurant was clean, the service was quick & friendly. The food, which came out quickly, was delicious!   This is definitely a great hole-in-the-wall breakfast & lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This place makes incredible sandwiches and is perfect for a quick lunch if you work around the area. My favorite is the French dip and my co-workers love the croissant sandwiches. The soups change daily and are home made and tasty. Their cookies are really good too. The people who work here are very friendly. I have not had their breakfasts yet becuase I am usually a few minutes from being late to work in the morning but I bet they are good."}
{"text":"First time here and I think it's lovely. I work around this area and want to keep coming back. The staff was friendly and welcoming. They keep the place clean and it's just a calming environment. I got the sandwich and salad combo and it was delicious!  :) ....I wonder how tasty their breakfast items are."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices! So glad I found this place! I had the veggie sandwich and it was so loaded I almost couldn't finish it. I was amazed at how filling it was. All the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious. I ordered takeout from here for 7 people and everyone enjoyed their sandwiches and wraps. I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its name.  They're only open for breakfast & lunch for its surrounding business neighbors.  Their menu is simple; breakfast, toasted sandwiches, cold sandwiches, panini, salad, and soup.  Nothing too great.  Their food is decent for their prices.  Like I said they serve to its neighboring businesses that need to grab something quick."}
{"text":"Awesome old style deli sandwiches. Very good. Not to many lioght and healthy options, but the food is very good. Great spot to call in your take lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"Found this on yelp with great reviews thought I'd try it out. I tried their BLT on crossaint it came out to $7 for a small sandwich. Maybe it wasn't their best sandwich but it was really bland and tasteless, not what I was expecting at all."}
{"text":"Ordered the California chicken sandwich, tasted excellent and fresh. Would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I discovered this place about 4 months ago and I've been eating here at least once a week ever since. The tuna with sprouts is my favorite. Best tuna I've ever had but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a spot to grab a quick bite to eat in this area of town and I finally heard about this place from a friend and came here with her for breakfast.   First impressions were nothing to write home about. Located in an industrial plaza, you would never know this little joint even existed from the main street. When you pull up there are only two parking spots immediately in front of the restaurant. I believe the others are around the corner but we came at 9:30am on a Friday and were able to snag both spots.   Upon entering, I noticed we were the only two patrons. We weren't greeted for quite some time as the only employee (possibly one of the owners) working behind the counter seemed more focused on finishing the ticketed orders. Another patron walked in - he seemed like a regular - and asked if we had been helped yet; we both said no. He spoke to the woman and cracked a joke about getting some service. Even still, the woman didn't speak or stop what she was doing! Finally, she helped us but by that time, the other gentleman had left out as he got tired of waiting. Once she helped us, she didn't apologize for the wait and wasn't super friendly. Interestingly, as soon as she began helping us, two other workers appeared from the back. It was actually quite strange. One, I believe was her husband (maybe the co-owner). They bantered a bit back and forth and apparently she had made a bunch of the orders incorrectly. After ordering at the counter, my friend and I grabbed a table and sat down to wait for our food. After a few minutes, I asked for a cup for water and overheard them discussing how he had made my friend's breakfast bowl with sausage when she had ordered it without. I actually watched him physically pick the sausage off of it - thank goodness he was wearing gloves! All that being said, the service, eh, was not the best.   In terms of the food, I ordered a panini bacon egg sandwich and it was just ok. It didn't come served with any sides. For $7, I'm not sure it was worth it. My friend ordered a breakfast bowl and she noticed there were a few sausage pieces remaining in it. It came in a very small paper bowl - she seemed to still enjoy it.   I was looking forward to ordering a coffee drink but they only had one of those diner coffee pots that was just about empty and looked like it had been sitting on the burner for several hours. They had refrigerated drinks but I opted for water from the fountain machine, which turned out to be Arizona tap water (blah!).  If I was in a jam, starving, and in the area, I would consider giving this place another shot. But my first experience here definitely wasn't great."}
{"text":"Ordered for 13 people for delivery at 10:58am. The restaurant is 2 offices down from us. Was given an estimated time of 12:00-12:10. Called at 11:40 to make sure they received the order in which they confirmed they had and would be here ASAP. Still no food here at 12:20pm ...they said they were waiting on a cobb salad and would be on their way.  I went over to the Lunch Break to see what the deal was. They said the guy just left with our food. It is now 1pm and still no food. They haven't been answering their phone. Nice people but we will not be ordering from them again."}
