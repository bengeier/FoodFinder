{"text":"Key West Shrimp House provides a lot of food for the money. I've been there four times and never had room for dessert. Dinners come with soup (step up to the seafood chowder for a little extra), a side (the twice-baked potato is the usual choice) and salad bar, which is less than amazing selection-wise, but has a delicious corn relish that's worth a second trip. Shrimp is obviously the specialty and is served in a bunch of different ways. There are other seafood options as well as a few steak and chicken choices. It's a ton of pretty tasty food."}
{"text":"As always we were greeted with a warm Hello and smile.  The service was excellent and the new owner even stopped by our table to see how we were doing.  This is my favorite salad bar around.  Our food was delicious and we even had to take some home.  Can't ask for better service when we go here."}
{"text":"The salad bar is fine. The food is fine. But this place is not worth enduring the service. Sign says seat yourself at lunchtime today. We wanted river view. Had 5 in our party.  Waitress was soo passive aggressive. Let us pull up a chair at the end of a four top but complained about it loudly. But was super sweet on water refills. It took an hour to get our food for no other reason but revenge that we added a chair to a 4 top. That's why tipping is good.  No good service. No good tip."}
{"text":"Still love this place.  Our young male server was once again excellent.  The owner visited each table and exuded southern charm.  However, a few of the dishes were not to our liking.  The shrimp scampi was loaded with cheese.  The vegetable casserole had been tasty, but this time it also was loaded with cheese.  Will certainly come back again and be more selective about what we order."}
{"text":"Although it is located north of the Ohio River, southern hospitality is served in abundance here. The food was good as well. Less casual than it appeared from the outside, the dining room is elegant but relaxed. And looking out over the river, watching the barges, eating great seafood served by the warm and gracious  staff made 5 stars an easy choice."}
{"text":"This was very disappointing.  I got the fried shrimp dinner.  For $18 I think it was a very poor value.  First, it comes with salad bar whether you want it or not.  Dinners should not automatically come with salad bar.  Second, it comes with soup too.  I got the chicken chili.  It was the worst chicken chili I have ever had.  There were literally 7 beans in it.  No chicken.  The shrimp was tough and not very tasty.  I recommend skipping this place and going to Captains D's.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"Decent salad bar, I had crab cakes which were not made with lump crab meat and were not very good. My fellow diner ate Scallops and Shrimp which were over cooked. Our server was a bit of a snob and not very helpful."}
{"text":"Ate here many years ago as a teen and remembered it as a special place with tasty food, so I was very disappointed to bring my family while hiking Clifty Falls and not have the same experience. My teens both ordered chicken alfredo. The younger one's review of it pretty much sums up our experience: \"The first bite was okay, but then there was a puke aftertaste.\" Both the scampi and fried shrimp were overcooked (clearly frozen) until dry and rubbery, and my sauce was completely flavorless, as was the twice-baked potato. Imagine ordering shrimp scampi at a hospital cafeteria--that's pretty much what you'll get here. But at fine dining prices! Location is neat in an old button factory--some tables have nice river views--but they've covered up much of the charm with tacky seafood decor. Service was very friendly and homey. If you go, stick to the salad bar and basket of crusty garlic bread."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood! We all had King Crab Legs and Lobster - it was off the chart good. A must stop and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Driving through Madison and stopped here to eat after reading reviews and looking for  a place on the river.  Location is not on the river, but it does have a view depending on where you are seated. There are two separate seating sections.  One with raised seating section with view of river, one with side view but obscured by bridge.  Latter section had a great fireplace with mantle setting a nice atmosphere.  It was on at the time of our visit.    Based on Yelp reviews, I ordered fried shrimp. Coating was light and tasty.  My husband had the Friday special of shrimp fettuccine.  It was creamy with large pieces of shrimp and well worth a try.  Both came with one side and salad bar.    Salad bar was small, but well stocked with unique twists on bar fare.  Wish I'd taken more of the mashed potato salad which was excellent as was the BQ? three bean salad.    Decor is dated, but so is the historical building.  Would suggest, however, doing something to hide the very visible wait service area as it was very cluttered and unsightly.    Will be back."}
{"text":"We were greeted by the owner and were able to select a window table overlooking the river.  Everyone was friendly and helpful, and service was excellent and prompt.  My husband had the fried shrimp and baked potato, and I had the grilled oysters and we both had the salad bar.  Everything was excellent and we really enjoyed the salad bar which features homemade salads.  I would recommend this unique restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Food = 4 (best coconut shrimp I've ever had... really!!!) Price = 4 Experience = 4"}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to say this was the worst, we were so disappointed and wished we had never gone back after years of having wonderful experiences there....the service was terrible but the food was worse!  We will not go back ever ...this restaurant will probably not be there in 2 years ....sad..."}
{"text":"The food is so terrible, I couldn't even make myself finish the meal. And the key lime pie? Foam on dry crust. Disgusting! We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent salad bar, huge portions, delicious entrees, creative kids menu, attentive servers! Bravo Madison!"}
{"text":"Good service and very friendly atmosphere. The food was very good the salad bar is small but it's unlimited trips to it."}
{"text":"Easter dinner with my family.  There's only one choice for us and Key West is it.  We were greeted by Susan and Brittney, who along with our server Andy, made sure we had a great experience from beginning to end.  We ordered a variety of plates including crab cakes, coconut shrimp, and steaks, all of which was cooked as ordered and tasted great.  There was also plenty to take home for later.  The salad bar is great which includes their homemade cole slaw which I enjoyed a lot and went back for more.  It would've been great to see Scott's cheerfulness too but we did get to sing happy birthday to a patron named John sitting next to us who was also having a great experience.  I recommend you add Key West as your go to place for families or couples wanting to enjoy something extraordinary!   Some things just make you go Woooo!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atmosphere!  I had the Seafood Norfolk and my fiancé had a ribeye.  We both had the double baked potatoes and a salad.  His steak was great and so was my seafood.  My only complaint was it was very expensive.  Not sure if I would go back or not but it was because is the cost, not the food."}
{"text":"VERY pricey!!! Outdated decor. Servers are friendly and knowledgeable but slow. Had to ask for refills on water and drinks. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"A definite stop for us in Madison every time we are in town.  My husband had the shrimp scampi and I had New York Strip.  The iced tea is delicious.  There is also a bar available for those who like to drink.  The waiter was impeccable.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Our family went there a week ago.  It was ugh, very disappointed, since we are about an hour away & thought it would be a good change from the norm.  My son had frog legs, they were inedible....tasted like fish....frog legs should not taste like fish!!!   The tilapia (sp?) was nothing more than rolled in crumbs and baked....I'm not sure it even really was tilapia.  I ordered the Shrimp Panama, GROSS!!!  My husband ordered the best thing, fried shrimp, can't mess that up.    Over all the food is yuck, but the service and staff were very friendly, if that even matters....I wish I had my $100.00 + back"}
{"text":"Place stinks like old folks home.    11 tables seated, rest not even pre-bussed."}
{"text":"Just don't go. You'll feel better hungry. Too much fried, fake, white bread, buttery fat laden crap. I guess the shrimp is OK. Anything else at your own risk.  May have been good in days past. Not now."}
{"text":"We visited Key West Shrimp House for Father's Day. we had a party of ten and they worked hard to get us on as fast as they could.  At first site, it's a little outdated, but it all kind of flows with the Anchor/Boating decor. It was bigger than I was excepting and we had plenty of room to sit. The menu is pretty big for a small town restaurant. I can see why locals love it. Some locals were known by name and even a gentleman with a walker was invited into the office to sit. (I offered him my seat but he insisted he didn't want it.)  I chose the Blackened Mahi Mahi with vegetable casserole. The casserole was not as I expected as it was full veggies in a sauce of some sort, seemed like mostly butter. I would have preferred steamed veggies. My Mahi Mahi was incredible! It was a huge portion, which I shared. I wish I would have boxed half of it and brought it home. It was like a steak almost!  The salad bar was pretty full. No boiled egg, which I just love as personal preference. Many varying options though, such as beets and pickled watermelon Rhine. They had a dill pasta salad which was awesome!!!! It came with a cup of soup which I upgraded to chowder for $1 more.  The chowder was good- not necessarily my favorite but my father and husband who LOVE it- said it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Was in Madison for work looking for somewhere other than the usual chain restaurants. I had come across this place and my coworkers and I decided to check it out. The food was great. I had shrimp and scallops and they were cooked perfectly. Absolutely delicious. The view of the river was beautiful and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. Will definitely be going here again the next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Wow... Very good.. Get here 30 min before opening.. Especially if you have a big party!  Filiget and lobster,  big lobster,  was delicious.  The blackened mahi also great and baked halibut too.  French fries were hot and good.  All you can eat salad with most meals and chowder(xtra) were also good.. Good service,  first time in madison,  and we had fun."}
{"text":"The Key West Shrimp House was such an amazing find when driving around Madison, Indiana looking for food. Located right on the river you almost feel like you are at a local eatery on vacation. The staff was super friendly, and the place was packed when we went, so I knew it would be good! I'm not understanding the 3-star rating! With all that being said, don't expect a five-star seafood restaurant. This is a mom and pop kind of restaurant, so my star rating is based on having gone in with that expectation. (Hopefully, this makes sense?) While waiting for a table we headed to the back for a drink at the tiny bar. Just be glad it's there...you and the workers must deal with the cards you're dealt lol! The bread and salad bar was good, and the fish and sides were delicious (this is my go-to word). The desserts are homemade and looked mouthwatering, but I was just too full. Please give the Key West Shrimp House a try and decide for yourself if it's worth a second visit. For me it was and my friends who visited after agreed!"}
{"text":"I won't be back, sorry. Unfortunately I felt it was too expensive for what you got and not very fresh. When we asked the server how the cab was, they even suggested something else..."}
{"text":"Absolutely Outstanding!!!  The food was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing!  The wait staff was totally on their game and never missed a beat!  The host was incredibly gracious and polite!  Even though were quoted a 45 minute wait, we were offered a choice of having a drink at the bar or venturing downstairs to play games and enjoy free soft drinks, and we were still seated within 30 minutes!  Can't wait to come back to Key West Shrimp House!  Y'all have to try it!!"}
{"text":"The following is a email I sent to the restaurant about 2 weeks ago and since I didn't receive a reply - I am posting it here.    \"I avoided posting on YELP or Google Maps, as a tour guide, because I think every restaurant should have a second chance.        My wife and I had lunch on Tuesday, about 1:00 pm.  We ordered a 1/2 order of cold shrimp, seafood chowder, and a fish sandwich.     The shrimp was \"mushy\" at best, waterlogged, and void of any \"shrimp\" taste.  I have never had shrimp that tasteless in my life (I'm 68 yrs. old - a retired chemist).      The fish sandwich was served on a stale dinner roll, instead of a bun, and it too was tasteless.  I could not taste any salt, pepper, or any other spices in the breading.      The seafood chowder was void of any flavoring - save the paprika seasoning on the top.     I have lived on both coasts and am an avid seafood diner, and been fortunate to travel the world on my employer's payroll and eating while traveling was my greatest joy.  I have a background as a cook, waiter, busboy, bartender, and restaurant manager prior to graduating from college and all of these jobs make me appreciate the hard work that it takes to succeed in food service.   We have eaten at your restaurant many times in the past and enjoyed the food; however, this time it was the worst.  I am only telling you this so you can revisit your menu/ cooking/ cooks to see if some thing has changed because you will be losing customers if all of the food is prepped like our meal was.    Please note that I do not want, nor am I asking for a refund or free meal - I only hope that you seriously take my comments as genuine, and objectively review your restaurant to constantly improve your flavor profile and food preparation.  It was truly the most tasteless meal that I have had in my life."}
{"text":"From the first time we saw Key West Shrimp House we thought, Hey, that looks like a great local place to try.  People we asked spoke highly of the food. It's wonderful they said. We finally decided to give it a try.  We liked the character of the building. The interior was fun, and the river view was pleasing.  We should have stopped with those observations.  First look at menu we noticed the pricing was a bit high compared to other establishments in the area, but if it's good it's not a deal breaker.  My wife and I normally share a meal because portions are often large and we don't like having a \"stuffed\" feeling after we eat.  Perhaps that upset the staff, I don't know.  We ordered an additional salad so we could both sample the salad bar. Perhaps it was just a bad day, but when the food arrived it looked a little like... left overs.  I thought the look on my wife's face was playful as she took a bite, until I also took a bite.   We looked at each other and both said the same thing....  Left over from lunch... and it was now evening.  Best thing we ate was the salad bar, and it was just a salad bar.   I'm sorry to say we won't return.  And for those that tell me how wonderful the food is, I'll simply respond with \" uh...not so much\"."}
{"text":"new owners! i had the red snapper. it was very good. wifey had the seafood norfolk. she was pleased. they have a great salad bar and good beer selection. full bar. service was good. i have given this place a questionable review in the past. but this visit brought some redemption. cautious 4 stars. we will give it another try soon."}
{"text":"I walked onto the porch of the Key West Shrimp House at 8:15 pm and was welcomed by a cheerful hostess that immediately thanked me for coming. I asked if I was too late, considering the restaurant closed in 45 minutes and she assured me, \"Even if you'd walked in at 8:55, you'd still receive the same great service.\"   She seated me and, after finding it was my first time at the restaurant, proceeded to explain the curiosities of the not so typical salad bar. Pickled watermelon rinds, mashed potato salad, three pasta salads and an herbed marinated tomato salad were just a few of the amazing options.  I remember her saying the soups were something onion, chicken something and seafood chowder. Yes, OMGoodness, whew!! I need a lifetime of that seafood chowder!!  Bryce was an amazingly attentive waiter and very personable.  He was able to explain the entrées and answer all of my questions.  I ordered New York strip, medium well with lobster and double baked potato.  He assured me that medium well was truly medium well.  When it arrived, he asked me to check the steak to see if it was to my liking. It was a perfect medium well.  The highlight of the evening was when the hostess came over and asked me everything was to my liking.  She manifested such an obvious passion about herself that I had to ask if she was the owner.   Of course she was, hahahaha!!! Cathy took the time to answer my queries about the history and how she became the owner.  25 minutes later and well after the restaurant had closed, we were enjoying great conversation.  I have never felt more welcomed in a restaurant. Cathy's South Carolina roots and southern charm has certainly made this a wonderful and memorable experience.  I highly recommend the Key West Shrimp House!"}
{"text":"Best seafood in Madison, IN. Be prepared to wait on special occasions like New Years, or Valentines Day."}
{"text":"We came to Madison for Mother's Day.  Key West Shrimp House was recommended to us by numerous friends. There were 16 of us in our party and when I called to get reservations, I was informed they didn't do reservations. The person on the phone was very polite, and informed me to come and put our name in, there was a room downstairs where we could wait with free soda, adults could get adult drinks and there are games to keep the children entertained.  We went out in our name and was told it would be approximately 45 minutes but he could not guarantee how quickly the parties upstairs would eat.  The gentleman that took our name came downstairs to announce as tables came available, he joked with us and was very pleasant. We waited 2 hours before being seated. It was well worth the wait. They were very apologetic about our wait, they had numerous staff that had called in that day. They gave us a sampling of desserts for our wait and thanked us for being so patient. Don't let the wait discourage you from eating at this establishment. From the person who answered the phone to the person who bused the table they all were very professional. We will eat here again when we are on Madison."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff. Fully stocked bar also. Coconut shrimp is amazing. If you want to make a great night even better ask for Davey. Best waiter ever!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the quality of the food. Blackened mahi-mahi was a little blan however cooked perfect. The shrimp cocktail and shrimp in a net were awesome along with the salad bar. The seafood chowder is the best around. Restrooms were clean as well. Three stars was based on the atmosphere, music was to low to cover conversations and the entryway smelled bad. The smell wasn't fish or seafood but sorta like ammonia or urine. The wait staff were prompt. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"This was a nice warm place to be welcomed after walking around at Clifty Falls and downtown Madison.  It was near dawn so the view against the river was awesome.  Two things that were most memorable.  The bread and the seafood chowder.  I would've been just fine having those two things.  But, I had to try the oysters Rockefeller.  Now, those weren't great for me.   The buffet seemed great, but I don't do buffets for the most part so I didn't try it.  I'd go back an hour away simply for the soup though.  It was that good."}
{"text":"Great local place that makes you feel at home. Cathy and her team really are top notch. From the service to the food made sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awsome 1970's type american fish house... we aint serving it unless its FRIED !!  actually..they do have some very healthy items....but...when in Madison...do as the Madisonians do !  Awsomely huge amounts of perfectly fried goodies....consider the \"Captains Table\"....intended for one..but trust moi.....split it !  Enjoy some Italian Margarhitas as well !  Wonderful and fun people that work there....the pony tailed maitre de is hilarious...just a really nice guy.....ooops...sorry can't remember his name....darnit !  This aint gourmet...but it is fun and good for the soul !"}
{"text":"I love the key west shrimp House I go there every time I visit Madison  The service is friendly and fast I love the view of the river the salad bars is fresh & delicious margaritas are so good! I always get the crab cakes & twice baked potatoes  The key lime pie is delicious"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and it was very good.  Fried shrimp and a choice of rice, sweet potato fries or french fries. I upgraded to a twice baked potato.  The shrimp was better than I've had at most other places.  The potato was good but it needed sour cream.  The salad bar is small but fresh.  I didn't care for the garlic toast that came with the meal.  It was too dry.  Key lime pie was really good.  The service was a bit slow but not excessively so.  If you're in Madison I recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"We're on our road trip of America and made our first stop in Madison. We wanted to go somewhere else, but it was closed and the locals made this recommendation. The atmosphere was just as sweet as the people, and the food was ok, but good for the price. The onion soup was really great and I even asked for a second cup. For the main dish I ordered the Seafood Platter: \"A combination of French fried food including Shrimp, scallops, fish, frog legs, and clam strips. One of our most popular dishes.\" We opted to not have it fried to be a little healthy... that was a mistake. I think I've learned that its best to order things as they were meant to be. The fish was just a little bland although my mom really liked it and the frog legs did not taste like chicken... unless chicken lives in a pond."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way through town, the owner personally greeted everyone, immediately making you feel welcomed and appreciated. The service was exceptional. Very family-friendly and accommodated my kids splitting an adult entree. Fresh salad bar included in meals. We enjoyed a shrimp appetizer, a seafood bisque and pasta entrees. Our 'half pint' picky eater, 3 year-old loved it too and devoured his kids meal! Each prepared well and served with smiles. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It was just ok....  The view of the river is nice.  The server was nice enough.  But the place just looks like an old face that had makeup put all over it to try to make it pretty but it's still ugly. I had the mahi mahi and a side of green beans.  The mahi was tough, like to the point where you almost need a knife.  The blackened seasoning saved it.  It's weird to rave about this because I never thought this would be something to mention but Dang were their green beans good!  My mom said they are like homestyle green beans.  Well whatever kind of style they were, they are the king of green beans.  Very good and they saved this meal.  The End."}
{"text":"I had the captains table which was a five course dinner. Tons of food and it came with two drinks for I believe $34.00.I thought everything was great. I cant wait to get back to Madison to have it again. The restaurant sits on the Ohio and has some great window seats with awesome views."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is on this place except for maybe the river view? We had to park in a near by grass lot because there was no parking.  We ordered the oysters to start and they were pretty fishy. I then ordered the crab cakes appetizer as my entree and the inside of the cake was so wet. My boyfriend had the platter and it was regular fried seafood. Definitely don't feel like you have to get dolled up to come, I was overdressed in heels. Our server however was the sweetest. Just wasn't impressed by food or location."}
{"text":"Not my favorite.  Our service was just okay.  She was very good at keeping my drink full, but she wasn't very personable.  My seafood chowder was wayyyy on the salty side.  It was full of seafood though.  I found several large shrimp and scallops in it.  Others at my table seemed pleased with their dishes.  I think I must have just chosen the wrong one for me."}
{"text":"Silver ware dirty plates dirty so look at your bottom plate oysters where not chilled bread was great soup was good"}
{"text":"The smell as I walked in was overwhelming...it smelled like urine...but I'm not sure what it was. The garlic toast was cold and dry. The beef soup was greasy and tasted like Campbell's canned soup. The salad bar was average. The fried cod was overpriced and the twice baked potato was nasty. They said the Key Lime Pie was homemade, but it clearly wasn't. The hush puppy ( not hush puppies) was very small and overcooked.  I think the restaurant needs a complete makeover and that includes getting rid of the kitchen help. When the server cleaned the dirty table I sat at, there was an empty glass on the table from the diners before me and she left that glass on the table!!!! And she poured my water in that glass and expected me to drink it!!! What a lazy server!  I wanted to try it and since I have, I won't be back. What a shame."}
{"text":"The service and staff were excellent.  The owner, Scott, was very upbeat and welcoming.  Cassidy, our waitress, was not only an excellent waitress but offered tips on fun stuff to do while we were in town.   My husband had steak and crab legs and I had the baked halibut oscar.  Both dishes were amazing.  They make great cosmopolitans also.  If you are in Madison I highly recommend you dine here."}
{"text":"The moment we entered the restaurant we were greeted by our hostess, Cathy,  with open arms and a big, sincere welcome ! Nice atmosphere and were seated promptly only to be greeted by our most awesome and friendly server. We ordered the Beachcomer and endless salad bar. Servings were huge and delicious...well worth the money. Joel & Debi"}
{"text":"I really, REALLY wanted to have a stellar experience here.  As it was, it was just....OK.  To be fair, the service was OUTSTANDING.  Our server was friendly and professional, and made us feel welcome.  The food was....well, it wasn't bad. But it wasn't excellent...it was just average.  The salad bar, while fresh and good, was a little underwhelming.  I chose the coconut shrimp for my entree, and, while the shrimp were HUGE...there just wasn't a ton of flavor to them.  My wife had crab cakes, and they simply tasted, to me, like frozen crab cakes you'd get at the grocery.  Again, not a terrible experience.  We certainly were full when we left, but I do think there are much better choices in Madison."}
