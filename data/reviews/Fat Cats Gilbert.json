{"text":"I've been here a few times for the awesome reclining, cushy seats.  There is a ton of room in each seat and ample leg room even when fully reclined.  All of the seats are assigned which allows you to get there late if you want.  Besides the great seats, every Tuesday night all movies are only $5.  In addition, you can refill your soda for free if you are willing to exit your comfortable seat.  The only food delivery I've seen is pizza from the local pizza place next door.  I have yet to try this option but who doesn't want pizza during your movie!!  Definitely check this place out.  The only time I ever had an issue was the theater adjacent to the mini golf and bowling since it is not sound-proofed enough."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I don't know how anyone can put a bad review. The movie theatre there is awesome! Huge reclining leather chairs, with more leg room that you thought possible. The best part, you can order some food and they bring it right to you in the theatre! Who wants to buy 7 dollar popcorn when you can recline with a pizza for the same price!? I left with leftovers! And the ticket for the move was less than going to any big movie theatre chain. I won't go anywhere else for my movie experiences.  I also loved the fact that, while we waited for the movie to start, I could grab a beer or cocktail and kick some ass on some arcade games. They have some new and enthralling games set up there. We almost missed the beginning of our movie haha!  Oh, and the staff there, are friendly and always ready to help. It's a comfortable and fun atmosphere.  Next time I'm definitely checking out the bowling. Nothing better than cosmic bowling, with the option of a movie within walking distance!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have four kids ages 3-9 and we all have a blast every time we come. I even had my company Christmas party here and we were very impressed with the staff, the accommodations and the price. The bowling was fun, the food is great, and the reclining seats make the movies even better. You can't beat this place!"}
{"text":"The theater itself is nice and has really comfortable recliners. The food is blah. We ordered a margarita pizza to share it was bad and had no flavor. It tasted like I was eating plain crust. I will return to see a movie but I won't bother with the food it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Held a birthday party here for my girls. People here are awesome. Only complaint I have is no one calls you back when you leave a message to book your party. Otherwise, very very good hosts."}
{"text":"I will be reviewing the theater specifically. The movie ticket prices are less expensive than harkins or AMC for example, and you can reserve your seats online prior to going to the movie, so that's pretty cool! Also, the seats are very comfortable reclining leather, with plenty of space between yourself and the rows ahead and behind you. What I didn't like about the theater was that the popcorn tasted stale and old, not hot, and the lady handed it to me in a bag that was all crumpled up at the bottom. I got myself a Coke from the soda fountain and once I was seated took a sip and realised it was flat. They must have not replaced the carbonation. And the screen and volume weren't as large and loud as a regular theater."}
{"text":"Wow! First time with my daughter on a spontaneous visit. Amazing service and the place was clean. We did the glo put golf and it was perfect on a hot AZ day as it is indoors. We will be back. You treat your customers and their children like gold!"}
{"text":"This place has false advertisement. They do not honor their online advertisement, shame. Make sure to call before you waist your time on driving to there location."}
{"text":"We just celebrated our Son Colton 5th Birthday party here and let me tell you it was absolutely amazing!! We paid for a total of 8 kids and they bowled for 90 mins, with a round of Glow in the dark miniature golf, and then each kid got a $5 Arcadia game card it also came with 4 large delicious pizzas and unlimited drinks for the kiddos! I will defiantly be using this place again for future birthday party's!"}
{"text":"Best place to watch a movie. Reclining seats with no annoying rails in front of you like other similar theaters. You can order food and have it delivered. Plus there's a wine bar, arcade and bowling!"}
{"text":"I love to go watch the movies with my husband and kids at Fat Cats. It is affordable. The seats are comfortable and they recline. I love that you can pick your seats ahead of time. I hate going to harkins where you have to get there super early to save seats."}
{"text":"Love this place love the deals the appetizers were amazing refillable drinks recline and dine he'll yah !! And oh 5 bucks Tuesdays !!!"}
{"text":"Great family friendly environment. We attended a movie and enjoyed the theater experience. Ordered reasonably priced cocktails before the movie and of course popcorn. Would definitely visit again as they have $5 movies on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Wow what can I say about this place accept bravo. What a great place to entertain the whole family. You can either play video games in the arcade , or go bowling or watch a movie in there theater.  Lot's  of different choices for the movies. Tuesday is 5 dollar movie night. Get there tickets on line and get a large popcorn free. Or get there early because seats fill up fast. I love the recliner seats very comfortable. To conclude my summary I would would say It's definitely a nice warm friendly atmosphere and a great entertainment for all ages.. So enjoy."}
{"text":"Such a fun place for my son's 10 th birthday!  Laura and Emily took excellent care of our group making sure we had everything we needed. From the greeting at the door with a \"we've been waiting for you! !\" to the very end,  we had a great and fun filled party!"}
{"text":"I went to a kiddos birthday party and we were able to sit in the most wonderful theatre chairs and eat  food! JUST LIKE AT HOME! This place is so cool! My kiddo and I have found our new play spot! YES! Thank you Ti for having your birthday party there! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Visited Fat Cats today for the first time to catch a movie at the dine-in theater. On Tuesdays they have $5 movies and if it's your first Yelp check-in, you get a free large popcorn with purchase of two movie tickets. In addition, I ordered a large drink so we spent $13 and some change for our experience, which is quite a bargain! I wanted to fill my cup with iced tea but they hadn't brewed it yet but an employee who appeared to be management (as a reviewer previously stated, mostly all employees are teenagers) offered to bring me fresh brewed tea to my seat once it was ready. Sure enough, about 5 minutes into the movie he showed up with my drink. That was great customer service. The popcorn was very, very good! I thought Harkins had the best but fat cats proved me wrong. The theater itself is perfect! I've seen movies at other dine-in theaters such as the iPic and Studio Movie Grill and fat cats surpassed my expectations! The seats are incredibly comfortable. Though we didn't get entrees from Pizini, I'd assume that it might be challenging to eat in your seat since there didn't appear to be a little tray or table to set your food down. Either way, I am highly impressed and will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this place every time I have gone. It's a nice place to get out of the heat and go bowling, mini golf or watch a movie. The prices are very reasonable but I do find the games to be a bit pricey but still a fun place to go to. I like that I can sit back and drink a beer while watching a movie!"}
{"text":"Family fun atmosphere. Nice alley. However tables are pushed close to seating; not very comfortable. A waitress never came to us; we had to go find her after 20 min. The arcade machine that gave cards to play wasn't user friendly. We had to try multiple times on multiple machines to get them. We had fun bowling and playing games despite the glitches."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this Family Friendly place in our Gilbert neighborhood! Our youth theater nonprofit, Limelight Performing Arts, hosted a karaoke fundraiser here in Pizini's. Laura, the events coordinator, made the process seamless and stress free. I appreciate a venue representative that is professional, responds quickly to both emails & calls, and is open to new ideas. She totally took care of us the day of and allowed us to bring equipment, flyers, and info for our organization and letting us turn up the music ;) Our kids had so much fun singing, playing arcade, bowling, and our parents did too! Extra bonus was the pizza had really fresh ingredients and an amazing crust, super tasty. I'm really happy to have found this place and look forward to hosting future fundraisers here, as well as bringing my kids for family time together.  I totally want to check out the theater with reclining seats"}
{"text":"Cool place.  Took my wife and son to the recline and dine (movies.) Overall, pretty cool spot to check a flick.  Prices are decent, the place is clean, and comfortable.  I like the idea of reclining on a chair.  Seats recline and food is served here.  Based on previous reviews I was afraid to order food from their pizza place so I have no opinion on the food.  The movie experience was great though."}
{"text":"I took the kids this weekend and purchased the tickets online hours before the movie started, you can select your seats as it's assigned seating. For all 3 of us and a soda was $18! The seats are giant recliners with electric adjustments and you can pretty much lay flat out. They have a great pizza restaurant and you can actually order pizza and they deliver it to you during the movie in your seat!  They have a bar, tons of arcade games, miniature put-put and a bowling alley. They have specials during the week, I think Wednesday you can get a lane of bowling for 90 minutes, 4 pairs of shoes, 2 pizzas and two pitchers of drinks for $30-$40  For star wars me and my friends want to go so we pre-purchased our tickets days in advance and selected where we want to sit and for 4 tickets was $20 total. If you want cheap and nice fun go to fat cats on Greenfield and baseline!"}
{"text":"This was so much fun for our entire family. The staff was so amazing and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. We played some games at the arcade which would've been fun even without our kiddos. Tickets were easy to win and prizes were great. Mini golf was a blast and got us to laugh at how badly we were at golf all together. We didn't do bowling or a movie but literally everything you need for fun is here. I loved it and we'll be returning!"}
{"text":"Took my eldest here for his birthday. The facility is pretty clean given its clientele (what kid doesn't make a mess?), the couche at the bowling alley were comfy and clean. Having the food delivered direct to your lane was a nice touch. Glow golf was fun, wish the course was larger! Arcade games were overpriced, but the kids enjoyed them. Should make the grabber games a little less rigged for you to lose. Pretty evident those things are wedged so tight it's a waste of money to even try. Overall a good time. Food was better than expected for a bowling alley."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! My family and friends come here at least twice a week. Either Tuesday for $5 movie day or to bowl , play games or mini golf. Everyone I have been I always have great customer service.  Bob the GM has always been helpful and I notice he makes sure his customers are happy. We have also gone to thunder alley a few times and the DJ Finchy Fresh makes it so much fun. He jokes around and gets everyone involved to play the contests . My son loves the football contest they play. It makes me so happy to have this amazing place so close to home and I feel comfortable bringing my kids here !"}
{"text":"Found out about this recline n dine the other day.  My son and I were going to go see a movie anyway and so we decided to check this place out.  We arrived early and so we played some of their few games.  I didn't like the fact that each game was a dollar.  I could see the racing game being at that price but skee ball really?  We ordered our food, one pizza and one panini along with drinks.  Our food was delivered to us in our assigned seats in the theater.  I wouldn't go as far as saying it was the best we've had, but it was delicious and we agreed that we could come here just for a meal.   3D movie price was reasonable as well as food prices.  Seating in the theater was comfy."}
{"text":"I love this place go there at least once a week! The service is amazing usually when you see younger people you expect to get terrible service but Fat cats has amazing customer service and the food/snacks are great! I love that they bring you your food so you won't miss a thing while watching a movie!"}
{"text":"Great place to bowl and watch a movie in the same night! Friendly staff great place to take your friends and family."}
{"text":"Very comfortable lounge chairs!  Love that we can pick our seats online.  Wish the concession stand people would kick it into 2nd gear."}
{"text":"We were excited when FAT Cats opened since it's within walking distance of our home. I like being able to order our food and have it delivered to our reclining seats during the movie. The one thing I don't like is there are not a lot of choices for new released movies."}
{"text":"Yes, five stars.  My son turned eight and Fat Cats did a great job with his party.  Our party planner, Danielle, went over and above by serving drinks to our routy group of ten, making sure they all got their bowling shoes, and walking the lanes a few times to retrieve dead bowling balls.  Facilities were beautiful, staff was accommodating, and the pizza was great!  Thanks, Fat Cats, for making this a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Awesome place love the recliners in the movie theatre, bowling is pretty Cool as well they play goos music. My kids love it there.  Mini golf is a little small but awesomely painted with a pirate theme. We have gotten through pretty quick when we have gone but I could see it being pretty backed up on a weekend"}
{"text":"I came to Fat Cats all the way from Goodyear (which is 40 mins away with no traffic) because of the good reviews on Yelp. It was my birthday and I thought lets go some place that has a lot to do. I was expecting to do some mini golf, a movie and bowl. However, when I got there I was told the mini golf was closed. I wish they would have said something on their website because I wouldn't have driven all that way just to bowl and see a movie. I could have done that right next to my house. But since I was already there I thought why not. So I got to Fat Cats at around 730pm and decided to bowl first because the movie wasn't until 9pm. I paid $38 for 2 people for 1 hour of bowling (which I ended up only playing 1 full game). I found out about 10 mins later that if I had came at 9pm the bowling would have been only $8.99 per person including shoes (about $18 off the price I paid). I wish the person at the register told me this info. cause I would have left and went to eat at a nice restaurant then came back at 9pm. I thought by not telling me that was shady thing to do to try to make more money off of me. Anyway, I ended up getting some food and 1 Blue Moon. I also found out right after I ordered that the beer would have been $3 compared to the $7 I paid if I bought it after 9pm. No one at this place likes to inform their customers about their specials and I think that is horrible!!! I tried to save the evening by saving a half off the movies because if you buy food and a drink it's $5 a ticket, but there's a catch which no one tells you about. You have to buy your food from the restaurant that is in the same building but not apart of Fat Cats. So, instead of paying $10 for tickets it was $20.  In total a night that should have cost only $50 ended up costing over $100 for 2 people.   I think the place was great that's why the 1 star, but the hiding of their specials and not telling me about them at the register is very WRONG!!!!  Only come to Fat Cats after 9pm that is my recommendation. It is not worth it any other time.   This place ruined my birthday and I will never be back again!!!   Update:   I got contacted by Bob Short, the General Manager of Fat Cats after I wrote this review. He asked me how he could make me feel better about my experience at Fat Cats and I said the only way I would be happy is if I got my money refunded and he did that. The credit card processing for the refund was taking too long so he offered to send a check in the mail. I received it yesterday.  I am very appreciative and thankful that Fat Cats would go out of their way to make me satisfied. This is what customer service should be like.   Now I will return to Fat Cats (that's if I ever drive back to that area), but still only when the deals are going on.   Thank you again Mr. Short for being so nice about everything."}
{"text":"Best theater in town!!! Decent prices, reclining chairs, and usually you can score a FREE large popcorn with a coupon they send out every month. The manager, Steve, always has fantastic customer service to both both adults and kids. I always tell my husband, \"That guy is so nice\" Great place to bring your family!"}
{"text":"Pretty fun to take kids and family! Love their deals and different activities available for my family. Overall a pretty big place and usually many things to do. The pizza is great too!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service from Sofia! She made my sons birthday party a success. All the kiddos had an amazing time and I didn't have to do anything. She was on top of it all! Laura was our event coordinator and she was great too! All employees that I enter acted with were so helpful and I felt very welcomed. I will definitely use Fat Cats again!"}
{"text":"Our go to place for movies.  Friendly service and clean theaters.  Like the ability to reserve a nice electric reclining chair for a movie and avoid the long lines and issues with other theaters.  They keep adding new stuff to make it easier and a better experience.  Not to mention the ability to order food to your theater chair.. hmm yes please.  Not a popcorn fan so I'll take a pizza anytime"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here since the month they opened. Manager and staff were very friendly and nice. The movie theatre is great and clean. Recently, we have not been going because all of a sudden they raised their prices again on video games. It's so ridiculous now and we also notice the machines break down a lot. We also noticed they went in and changed the number of tickets you could win on most machines that pay out 1000 tickets (with a higher price on top of that).  Its such a bummer they do that, we will not be coming here anymore if they keep changing up the price on video games and make the winning the bonuses half the tickets they were two weeks ago.   Prices are too High for video games. Rip off"}
{"text":"My daughter went here on a field trip during summer school and loved it! I am going there with my family soon! Plus she went the miniature golf area.  :)"}
{"text":"I managed movie theaters for eight years and have to say this is really special experience. It's a break from the norm and is reasonably priced. The seats are amazing, everything is digital now- so you can't screw the film up, food is good, and they have beer. I take my daughter once a week."}
{"text":"So here's the deal...Fatcats is lovely. They have an arcade, cosmic bowling, glowy mini golf, and a movie theater that not only has reclining seats (insert heart eyes here) but also is cheaper than local non-reclining theaters! You can order food and take it into the theater and their prices are on par with a regular restaurant, which is refreshing for a movie theater. I recently went bowling there and it was super fun! They were showing old school music videos, which did make me feel a little old hearing my \"jams\" in the mix, but after a glass of wine or two and it was all good. Plus it made for a good unofficial karaoke-bowl. Super fun time all in all. The only thing that would make it my regular \"go to spot\" would be being able to take wine and beer into the theater (right now you have to drink it outside of the theater), but it's not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Fat Cats if pretty great. I walked in just to bowl but ended up playing mini golf and seeing a movie with my loved ones. The seats in all the theaters are leather reclining chairs and we also got our food delivered to our seats in Star Wars. The kids had fun in the arcade and they don't have paper tickets, they have E-Tickets that go on your game card and most of the games had really good payouts for the kids to get some prizes and to top it off there bar is great."}
{"text":"The theater seats are extremely comfortable. That being said, I doubt I'll be back to watch a movie there. The track lighting on the stairs was too bright. White fluorescent bulbs in a dark movie theater? I was really surprised at how much it distracted me from the movie. It was pretty irritating. The bowling and games are lots of fun...which gets the stars."}
{"text":"This review is for the mini-golf, the arcade, and the general ambience/service.  We have Pogo Passes and wanted to use them for some cheap family fun. We took our daughters (ages 5 and 4), planning to bowl, mini-golf, see a movie, and maybe have some pizza.   There was only one person ahead of us at the register when we got there, but we still ended up waiting in line for several minutes. We were told that our Pogo Passes were not valid that night (Saturday), which is obviously our fault for not checking, but is perhaps a policy they should reconsider. We decided to do mini-golf anyway (it's fairly cheap), and went back there ready for some fun.   And...it really wasn't fun. Our younger daughter was scared by the large murals of huge sea creatures (sharks, giant squid, etc.) and the eerie pirate music (which was very loud at at least a couple holes). And it didn't take us long to realize that the course was all but unplayable. Weird obstacles just thrown in the middle of the course, tiny tunnels to get through (one of which had a hole in the middle of it, so your ball got stuck if you did manage to get it through), and open ended greens that let your ball go flying onto the next hole if you overshot. Sure, our kids had an okay time hitting their balls aimlessly, but it was honestly just no fun for the adults, and I'm sure the kids would have been happy to skip it.   By this time, we had decided to go elsewhere for dinner and a movie (that's how bad the \"golf course\" was). But we had already paid for some arcade games, so we headed over there.   The games seemed to be either \"jackpot\" games (like try to win the impossible jackpot of tickets) or shooting/racing games, with ski ball, basketball, and air hockey thrown in. There were also a couple \"claw\" games, where you try to get the impossible prize. So again, not great for younger kids, and cheap feeling for the adults. The worst part about the arcade experience, though, was that the card that you swiped to play the games. It's a good idea to have a digital card with a balance on it instead of tokens, but that thing was very difficult to get to work. It never worked on the first try. Not once. Sometimes we couldn't get it to work at all, and we'd have to skip the game entirely.  As far as the general ambience goes...it seriously felt like a 10 year old place, even though it's brand new. It felt very \"budget\" and not exciting or modern. The employees we dealt with were not particularly friendly or unfriendly...they were just kind of there, some of them working, some of them chatting amongst themselves.   It really was a disappointing experience. We will go back to try the bowling, since we have the Pogo Passes, but I don't have high hopes for it anymore. I hope they make some big changes to help this place reach its potential, before too many people are turned off like we were."}
{"text":"great family night out. comfortable bench seating at the lanes, good selection of domestic and imports. customer service on point. minor issue with food that sterling(?) fixed immediately. good times were had by all .  will be returning!"}
{"text":"Why are the Gilbert, AZ location movie theaters infested with moths?  I've notified employees months ago and they are still there. Buzzing in front of our faces and (maybe) landing in our popcorn! Gross!!!"}
{"text":"Great movie experience. Love the chairs and the space you have. We ordered from the restaurant and it was delivered to the theatre.  The food taste great much better than the normal movie food at other theatres"}
{"text":"I will refrain from writing a 2 page long review, but $400 for a birthday party, was not at all worth what we got. First off, the party hostess completely screwed up the bowling lane names that we had put down, so it was complete chaos...none of us knew who's turn it was or kept score, because it was complete confusion. We asked party hostess to correct it and she said she couldn't because it would take 20 minutes. So we just used four lanes of bowling and took turns, not really keeping score or knowing who's turn it was. Then, she brought out 7 pizzas for our party of 18, so we ran out of pizza. I didn't mention it though because she kept reminding us our time was up and we had to move to the golf tables. The 14 kids were in glow golf for 5 minutes at the most. It wasn't until I left that my daughter said the hostess told the kids they had to leave because they were cheating. Ummm its mini golf, not the Pro Am...I wish I had known that's why they only played for a couple of minutes, I would have left a smaller tip. Pizza was decent (the teeny tiny slice I had), and the bowling area is very nice. I just wish there was more attention given to our birthday party, especially for the price we paid."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Me and a friend tried out the movie theater and the seats are AMAZING but as for it being our first time it was a little bit of a let down. Staff was different then most family places they were just there. Not rude but not very helpful either. Maybe it was because it is new and not opened for long. EvenThough lines to get movie tickets and concessions only had one person ahead of us it still took a long time to get tickets and order. Also we did not realize we could get food delivered to our seats. Would of been a fun thing to add but we figured it out on our own after we saw the movie. Just a simple have you been with use before might of been a nice question to ask. If we said no a little info might of helped sell more of your items! I'll be back to try out the bowling and take friends to have a nice seat at the theater but over all I just wish harkins had those chairs!"}
{"text":"Great family atmosphere. Arcade, glow in the dark golf, bowling alley and a movie theater all under one roof very convenient. Movie theater has reclining seats and they also offer $5 movies on Tuesday's."}
{"text":"I only want to see movies in the plush recliners.--wonderful movie experience.   Great to kill time with the kiddos and  I often play just as many games as they do. ---many highly addictive arcade games.  When bowling the lights are difficult for me to adjust to the dark lighting with black lights."}
{"text":"The food and the service is always top notch. Fun for the whole family. Clean and well organized. The miniature golf was a little disappointing BUT that is not their signature attraction so I give them a pass but I will pass on that the next time we visit."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day for drinks, games and movie. We had a lot of fun playing games even though we are adults lol! Some games didn't work well but I'm sure if we asked someone would have helped us out. The drinks are good! I wish we were there for happy hour. We ordered food to bring into the theater. They bring it out in take out boxes when the movie starts. No servers. Food was ok, kinda like bar food. All in all we will go back again."}
{"text":"I tested this place out bc my son will be having his birthday party there. I am glad to see that the movie experience is awesome because I was not blown away by the games and the golf is hard but the pirate theme is cool. The card for the games needed to be swiped at least 3 times for every game to a really start working and it gets $$$. $10 doesn't get you far at all and the prizes have really high point redemption values. Flipside way surpasses in this area. When I spoke to an employee about the card and the games I didn't get much of a response except \"yeah we know....\" The place does look way more dated than its recent opening should portray. I am still looking forward to the movie here but otherwise I will stick to Flipside."}
{"text":"Bad first impression. The 1 star is because It is conveniently located, and the seats are comfortable & Theater is large. Food is average.   Now for the bad news.  Terribly warm - my husband had to complain so they would turn the air on for a few minutes, then it switched off again.  We couldn't sit back against the seat it would cause us to sweat.  The worst part is 2 babies cried the whole last hour of the movie. Who takes one year olds to an 8:30pm movie with giant scary dinosaurs roaring at the screen? Since the parents were too rude and selfish to leave, (just hung out in the hallway still inside the theater-- the manager should've done something at least one of the 2 times I complained. At least 5 other people were appalled as we walked out of the theater doors. I told no less than 3 employees, all I heard was 'sorry'.  I even made it clear it was our first visit. At the very least they should have refunded our tickets, or offered passes, might have encouraged us to give them another chance. I think we will try Roadhouse Cinemas where they don't let babies cry through your movie."}
{"text":"We used our Pogo Pass to bowl, considering it was spring break there was an 1.5 hr wait but they were kind enough to call us when our lanes were ready. The kids had fun using bumpers and the ramp for the littler ones that couldn't throw/roll the ball. The only down side was we wanted a pitcher of soda and they don't do that you have to purchase individual drinks starting at $2 for a small!!   We've previously done the $5 movies on Tuesdays, it's reserved seating! Which is great and the glow mini golf which was just so so."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The movie theater is extremely clean and the recliner is a super comfortable. The bowling alley is a lot of fun and there's always good music playing."}
{"text":"They finally got their act together and they offer online movie tickets.   Place is still overpriced but the movie experience we had lately was 100% better.   Great that you can reserve your seats and this place does not get too crowded."}
{"text":"Good theater with good seats. The concession stand was a bit chaotic with people there for other activities crowding the area. We stopped by the glow golf section after the movie and had some more fun. A good place for hot summer days."}
{"text":"This was the only theater that had a movie at a time that was right for us. Getting our tickets was painless. So was ordering food. The theatre and seats were awesome!   They brought the food to our seats. I wasn't expecting much taste wise-- and I wasn't disappointed--bland fried chicken tenders and a bland panini sandwich.   Overall, a nice find. We'll be back!!! We'll just skip the food part."}
{"text":"Update:  After my initial review I was contacted by the general manager of Fat Cats Gilbert. He was very apologetic and was very understanding. I want to support this business and after my conversation I look forward to our next visit being a positive one. Come in and give them a shot. If there is a problem talk with the management, they really care about their customers!"}
{"text":"If I could do a negative rating I would. I have never been here prior to tonight's fiasco and not sure I could be convinced to return. I was like oh how fun - movies, games and a bar? Fun adult night. We reserved our tickets and arrive early to check out the amenities. Well...we head to the bar after getting our tickets and I sit there for 10-15 minutes...as young girls walk up and are served immediately. Now, I'm not a 22 year old but I'm not exactly Shrek either. I finally sat at the bar HOLDING MY DEBIT CARD ON MY FOREHEAD. Still was looked over. After other people at the bar directed the bartender - and I use that term VERY loosely - over to me, I indicated I wanted the drink shown on the standup sign on the bar. He looks at me...says \"what's that....?\" Reading the sign. I'm like uhhhhhhh no thank you. I head to the concession area and ask if there is a manager. The young lady informs me that WAS the manager ( while rolling her eyes). She then asks if I would like another manager. Why yes....I believe I would. The other \"manager\" comes over and I repeat my story. Only to be told \" well I feel for him ...he isn't really the bartender \". Ok. This is a Saturday night. Shouldn't there BE a \"real bartender\" on what I would assume is their big night of the week? I ask \" so....this is my first time ...and probably my LAST time...here. And I will be sure to tell everyone about my experience. Do you even care?\"  The response was a blank look reminiscent of Helen Keller at a rock concert - nada. Never again. Good thing I had a Fandango gift card for the tickets. Just sayin."}
{"text":"We love coming here for movies! Normal adult tickets are $10.75 (including fees). The theater rooms are always clean and set at a comfortable temperature. The reclining seats are the best part where you can lean back and put your legs up. You can reserve your seats prior to showtime and just show your barcodes on your phone and cruise right in."}
{"text":"Definitely a fun place to go with family id give it 5 stars but the food cashier jerri was argumentive for no reason and unprofessional she seemed very upset and projecting her negative attitude towards us. Me and my family paid $300 hundred dollars for bowling and dinner employees should not be having a attitude towards us thats not what we paid for we was jus wanted to have a fun family night. Other than that everything was good"}
{"text":"We enjoy family night here on sundays ! But never had food just bowling,movie and mini golf !!"}
{"text":"I love coming here with my family, assigned seating is the best part. Comfortable recliners and food delivered to your seat, it's great. The concessions are fairly priced too."}
{"text":"Seats are really comfortable you can but them back and put your feet up. Good part is that you don't have to squeeze threw the aisle to get some where. The five stars are for the theater that they have i love it."}
{"text":"This place is WAY better than a standard movie theater. Food prices are a lot less expensive as well. This will be my go to theater from here on. The only negative is that you can't take your beer into the theater. Oh, The Last Jedi is awesome too!"}
{"text":"My husband & I ate here on s Saturday night. We wanted to bowl but there's 1.5 hr waiting list. No big deal, we decided to put a $20 bill into new arcade card and play some games. Literally more than half the games would NOT read the card no matter how slow/fast we swiped or what directions. Many of the ones that did read ate our card balance & didn't let us play. We reported it to arcade/projectionist Guy  & he made us walk around & relive everything that went wrong. He gave us extra tokens & put $4 on our card. I'd rather have $10 back. We were treated like we were trying to score free crappy token gear instead of like customers with an issue. Whatever. Won't be back. Plenty of places to go on Saturday night in Gilbert besides fat cats. No thanks. I'll happily pass on this place. Bad service=bad time."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! This is the only place I will ever go to see movies ever again. We went there as a family today to check it out and it blew our expectations out of the water!! When we walked in we decided we were going to see a movie so bought our tickets which are very reasonably priced! Then instead of the same ol' popcorn (which you can also get) we got pizza! And the pizza was delicious, along with the exotic variety! So while we waited for our movie and food, we drank a beer and played some of the many awesome video games they had! Then they deliver your food right to your seats. The seats, OMG the seats! The most comfortable seats ever! They sprawled back, reclined with tons of foot space in front! We were on cloud 9!!! We ate our pizza, watched our movie, while completely relaxed! We will definitely be back to bowl, golf, and see more movies!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were there yesterday and watch the movie in the recliners awesome sound system"}
{"text":"Fat Cats is a family fun center that opened a few months ago near my house. They offer bowling, miniature golf, dine-in movies, arcade games, food and drinks. For the most part it's a lot of fun, but there are some minor drawbacks to it. For starters, if you are a serious bowler, the lanes are to dark to see the markings on the ground that help you set up your bowling shot. The extra large video screens also cast a big reflexion on the lanes as well. Again, this is a family fun center not an AMF lanes, so if you remember that you'll still have a good time. The miniature golf is okay, not great. I'm not sure how they would improve it really. It just seemed flat and hard to follow where to go next. Small children like the glow in the dark aspect behind it. The dine-in moves are awesome. If you've ever been to one you'll know what I mean. I just wish you could find their movie times on something other than their website. The arcade is always a pleaser. Although if you're hoping to buy big prizes with the tickets you win its gonna take a while. The food is, well, pretty much like chuck e cheese food but the kicker here is, THEY HAVE A FULLY STOCKED BAR!!! That will numb any parent's anxiety of feeling like they are at chuck e cheese!"}
{"text":"Okay so I can safely say I've tried all parts of fatcats and am happy with what I pay for and get in return. The place is kept clean, caters to adults and kids and the prices are better than going to harkins or Brunswick AMC. The mini golf is worth exactly what you pay for it nothing too crazy in there."}
{"text":"Our 4 year old loves this place. Movie theater is nice, games are fun and so is the bowling. Love that the restaurant is attached. They even have ice cream there! A kids paradise and even the parents will love the cushy seating at each lane and reclining seats in the theater. We've not done the mini golf but that looks like fun too"}
{"text":"Wife and I had the best night with a group of friends. We spent 4 hours between movies and bowling and had a hoot of a time!"}
{"text":"I usually dislike this kind of place. I've never been because I figured it was like Dave and Busters. Expensive place for the kiddos to drop a couple hundred dollars into a game so they can trade it in for junk while the adults eat overpriced burgers and drinks.   I was pleasantly surprised. I apologize for the extra review in advance. I need to explain how I ended up at Fat Cats by first explaining how terrible of an experience I had at AMC. :-)  We went to an AMC and stood in line for 20 minutes while people slowly picked seats. (holy crap, this concept is annoying. Gone are the days of just getting there early and finding a decent seat. I guess it would be ok if people were capable of making a quick decision.) By the time we got the front, the only seats left were the handicapped and the cashier was willing to sell us. Luckily before we purchased, she informed us that we would have to sit on the floor. The floor? Anyway...for $14.00 a seat, I'll pass on the movie theater floor. How can you sell floor seats?   We ended up going to Fat Cats because it was the only other theater with another late showing. WOW...what an awesome place. We were early so we sat down for some food. $5 appetizers and $3 beers. $9.50 for a movie ticket with reclining leather seats. The theater was clean, great screens and sound, the service was fast and friendly.   This is my new go-to place. Dinner and a movie for two for around $40.00 with drinks."}
{"text":"Children's paradise.  Arcade, bowling, theater, pizza parlor.  There is even a little pub so the dad's can chill.  Theater is pretty sweet. Lounge chairs that recline into a position that is almost grantees you'll fall asleep.   Only suggestion: designate the seating in the theater a little better. I have had to ask that someone move from my seat mire than once."}
{"text":"We went here for my sisters 21st birthday and it was so great, the service was amazing and Laura was awesome with her service so sweet and filled all our needs. I would 100% recommend this place for a birthday or just to come and have fun, and if you have a party have Laura be in charge she made our huge group so happy !(: thank you for making m sister birthday the best ! The prices are pretty good too, and they have a cute glow in the dark mini half course which is so fun, and I love the movie theater, $5 movies on Tuesday and it's the best reclining chairs ! All in one family fun!"}
{"text":"Great fun place to go! They have an arcade, bowling, and movies. The arcade is inexpensive and will provide hours of fun. The staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The kids love going here, the movies are extremely comfortable, and food in the theater delivery is an awesome perk!"}
{"text":"Love bringing kiddo to the movies here----the only reason it is not 5 stars is that the concession lines are long and take forever"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to watch a movie! Once you experience a movie in those huge recliner seats, you'll never want to go to a regular theater again. You can even choose your seats from home so you'll have them reserved and waiting for you when you arrive. I've never had food delivered to me during the movie, but patrons nearby have received pizza  as they are watching the movie and that seems like a nice perk."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time yesterday to watch a movie. The theaters and seating are awesome and the popcorn is delicious. We sat in the back row and I could hear knocking on the wall behind me and I could hear kids talking/screaming a couple of times, but other than that, it's great!  The bowling alley looks awesome. I have to say, I was impressed.  Glow-in-the-dark miniature golf looks like fun, too.  I would suggest that employees wipe down the counters in between customers; it would take two seconds. There was stuff all over them and looked messy. The carpet could also use an occasional use of a push sweeper to keep the carpets looking clean and free of popcorn, You don't want such a great place to start looking like the Superstition Springs dollar theater. It wasn't incredibly busy when we arrived, so these are tasks that could easily be taken care of.  Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We love fat cats! A ton of things for my kids to do and they always provide great service."}
{"text":"We had a surprise party for our daughter' 14th and it was amazing! From the moment Laura called me to help me with the details to Tracy making sure everything was perfect during the event! Laura was very helpful with answering my questions and suggestions for how to make the surprise work!! She even made sure my daughter couldn't hear my voicemails should she have to leave one!! Upon arrival Tracy greeted our family and quests and had them waiting until I arrived with our daughter. Once we were all there Tracy made sure that we had any & everything we could need! She was simply AMAZING Great place for a party!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a family night or a date night.  Food is just ok, but I figure you can't be all things.  Reclining movie seats are the best!  Tickets are not much more than the regular theaters.  Call and get your movie tickets rather than waiting to buy there."}
{"text":"Love that its not a chain establishment. Great movie choices, love that you can pick your assigned seat, huge comfy recliners!"}
{"text":"We came here for movie night with a few friends. Wow! They have it all in on place: arcade, bowling alley, movies! I totally wish I had known about this place sooner. We only went to the movies though. The chairs were very comfortable and you can reserve your seats. The concessions are very reasonably priced too! Had a great time here and hope to be back to try out the bowling!"}
{"text":"People in our neighborhood were talking this place up and we were pumped to be able to reserve specific seats for Star Wars opening day ahead of time. Luckily, we still arrived 25 minutes early and had seats picked because lines were (expectedly) long and every show sold out. Parking was easy to find and we skipped the ticket line by going to the electronic kiosk on the wall to the left of the ticket booth (new purchase or reserved via web or Fandango).   We waited about 15 min. in the concession line where they had three cashiers and a food runner. Even with the chaos of opening day of a huge movie, all staff were so professional and friendly...even making jokes. Rock on! Concessions are moderately priced and a good variety. You can order actual food like apps, pizzas, sandwiches, etc. that they will deliver to your seat in the theater.   The theater itself has amazing, cushie leather reclining chairs with extended stadium seating and lots of legroom. You don't even need to get up for someone to walk by. The height difference from row to row is extreme and all rows but A seem to be seats with a good view (the screen takes up the entire wall above row A). Row c (handicapped row/main walkway we were seated in) has an amazing view but way too many people walking by between bathroom breaks and staff constantly bringing food. Seats 6 and 7 in any row are center screen. The sound system is amazing and the temperature is slightly cool (we'd much rather be cold than hot). Just bring a sweater or blanket if you get cold easily.   The only negatives were the people walking in front of us constantly, a few dark spots on the screen, the odd layout of the lobby area and an issue with ticket ordering. The layout is probably no big deal at non-busy times. The ticket ordering on the fat cat website was a bit annoying, as there were three seats left together and we only needed two...but the system doesn't let you leave one seat empty. We called and they mentioned that they couldn't solve over the phone but we could come purchase in person to override the system. We bypassed this by purchasing on Fandango (had to pay small convenience fee).   Overall great experience. We will be back and try for row D, seats 6&7. Most comfortable seats of any theater, even more so than the recliners at Regal Gilbert 14. The only difference between here and Regal is you share armrests here but have much more cushion and back/lumbar support. Yes, I know this makes me sound like a 90-yr-old. Ha! Enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"This place is clean, fun and makes you want to have fun no matter if its the bowling, glow in the dark mini golf, watch a movie in their recliners or play in the arcade area. The restaurant prices are a bit pricey so we decided to eat before we came here. We watched a movie and the recliners reclined back which made it a very comfortable watching experience feel like home. You are able to order meals and the servers bring your food to your seat in the theater. They do have free refrills on the drinks but they are self served so if you are needing a refill you will have get out of your seat and grab it yourself. There isn't any tables that you can eat off of so be careful on spilling it on yourself if your a clumsy eater like I am."}
{"text":"Came here to chill and bowl. None of the balls have the right finger sizes which isn't that big of a deal. The thing that is ruining our night is the annoying guy on the mic calling himself a DJ. Completely messing up the atmosphere in this place. Called himself DJ Minty Fresh. Saying the song watch me isn't \"real music\" then playing pour some sugar on me asking everyone to sing for a prize. Get the fuck outta here! Terrible. If I come back it won't be for awhile & if they have another guy talking the entire time trying to be funny I'll never come back. Such a good idea for a fun place can get ruined by one person. Staff is clueless. The front desk guy just came to clear out area at the lanes & told just to \"tip our server\" to imply we don't tip. I've worked in bars 20+ years I tip 20% or more to the worst servers. Never coming back here. We are all adults here hanging out on a Sunday night after 10pm know your audience. Terrible place."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Fat Cats and we had a great time. My beautiful wife ,myself , my 10 year old ,and my 7 year old plasma two games of bowling. We enjoyed simple snacks like popcorn, slushes, and pop the first game. The second game we had jalapeño poppers, chicken tenders, fries , and pepperoni pizza. Very satisfying! We will have to visit again to try mini-golf, movie , arcade games"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great as you can preselect your seats and not have to worry about getting a good seat if you are not early. Also they serve Stella what's not to love??"}
{"text":"We recently had my daughter's birthday party here, and I was blown away.  Initially, it was a little chaotic, trying to sort out the shoe situation, but once the kids had their correct shoes, they started bowling and had a blast!  Every member of the staff from Melisa (the event manager) to Michael (our server) to the mechanics and servers and support staff we met truly provided excellence in customer service.  They all really wanted to make sure we were happy and having fun!  Melisa went out of her way to be accommodating with me and making it special for our birthday girl.  I loved that her primary concern was that my daughter had a great time.  She was so pleasant to work with!  The pizza was really good!  I mean, when I think of bowling alleys I typically don't think of great pizza.  I remember greasy triangles where the cheese slides off the slice.  But this was high quality- we will probably return for the pizza very soon!  One tip I would have for you is be aware that if you have small children, the mini golf area might be a little frightening (we lost a few golfers that way) but the kids seemed to really enjoy it!  Overall, we were told several times over this place was the best party they had been to in a long while.  Our guests loved it, we loved it. We are already looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times for bowling and have had the pizza at pizini a couple of times. The bowling is great. The price is reasonable and my kids love it. They charge you for the lane by the hour with up to 6 bowlers and the bumpers automatically go up for the kids (designated when you pay). I really like the pizza. It's cooked in a wood fire oven so the crust is crisp and chewy. Plus I think it's reasonably priced. I've also had the fried zucchini, wings, and onion rings, all of which were good. The only thing I do not like is how much they charge for the arcade games (around $1 per game). It adds up quick when you have little kids who want to try everything. We also tried the goofy golf once but probably won't do that again as our kids are a little too young and really didn't get it. Overall we like this place and will keep coming back for the bowling and pizza."}
{"text":"We came to watch a movie here with my friends visiting from out of state! I was so surprised at how amazing this place was! Great theater and reclining seats and it was super easy to make reservations online. Prices were less expensive than the other movie theaters in the area! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We had a great time at fat cats. The food is much better than typical bowling alley grub. The nachos were really great! Unfortunately we had a lot of issues with lane 3 getting stuck and had to go ask for assistance in fixing it more than half a dozen times."}
{"text":"We had my daughter's birthday here recently. It was amazing Laura was very accommodating and super helpful. I didn't have to do anything Laura took care of everything and kept the kids having fun and happy while the adults got to sit back and chat.  I would definitely have another party here again! Thank you so much for everything.  One happy mama"}
{"text":"I have been here twice with my children. Always fun and food is pretty good at Pizinis."}
{"text":"Came here last night. Gotta admit it was a pretty fun date! We play with the arcade games then watched a movie in their super comfy recliner chairs. Overall the experience was pretty good. It's a great place to take your family. They also have a bowling alley and they serve alcoholic beverages. It's like a building of fun for all ages."}
{"text":"Big disappointment, my son insisted on \"0\" stars but that wasn't an option. The food was OK, but the staff seemed very disorganized and the place was empty. They definitely needed supervision. The games were few, and some were broken. The cards used to load and play the games, were difficult to use and my kids are older, don't know how little ones use them. No one was available to help. The kids were so disappointed after gaming, they didn't even care to get prizes! The glow golf, had a line out the door, not sure why and didn't care. My hope was to see a \"family\" movie, on a hot day. Unfortunately, Sinister 2, Hitman 47 and Straight out of Compton didn't seen \"kid friendly\" Sadly, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place. Horrible soda. Need to improve the tase, does not taste very good. Other than that, no complaints. Clean, nice staff and good popcorn."}
{"text":"I've visited Fat Cats approximately 5 times now and feel like I'm now able to add a review.   Movie theater: The theatres are brilliant and I give that portion 5 stars. Big comfortable reclining seats. The theatres are kept clean. It's the best way to watch a movie in my opinion. Great spot! The one negative is that if you choose to order food it's very dark and hard to eat without been able to see.   Food: I have tried multiple meals from Pizini while watching a movie. Tried pizza twice (Margherita & Carnivoro). I was very disappointed with the lack of flavor in the sauce,  very bland especially noticeable on the Margherita pizza as the sauce needed to shine with such few ingredients. The caprese sandwich/panini was very bland, needed salt and they forgot to add basil. I took it back and they remade it... But still very bland. The good... Some of the other sandwiches are much more flavorful. The Salume Italiano & Cubano had much more flavor and I really enjoyed. I've had the Salume in several occasions and it's probably my favorite. Their sweet potato fries had good flavor but were very soggy. The pasta salad that accompanies each sandwich is OK, but nothing fabulous."}
{"text":"Love this place. We go all the time. Replaced Harkjns for us. Love the seats and the crew is always nice. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"I really like Fat Cats! I think the whole vibe of the place is great. Very affordable too! My fiance and I love to grab our seats for a movie ahead of time on their website. The theater seats are comfortable and spacious. (I don't feel like I am sharing a couch with a stranger :)) Up next we are going to try the bowling ally!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here with my family and friends. They have movies, arcade games, bowling, and mini golf. Lane 14 made the ball curve a little to the right because the floor was uneven, but other than that I have no negative reviews. Me and my friends always consider going here when deciding what to do on the weekends."}
{"text":"When I asked my niece what she and her friend wanted to do, their eyes lit up as they suggested this place. The idea of a family fun megamix of bowling, mini golf, and arcade seemed like a fun place to me, too, though it seemed to me that a couple prongs of that trifecta might have received short shrift - particularly the mini golf, the nine holes of which are over in about half an hour, and the arcade, which is small and dominated by the rigged performance-type games (skee ball, test your strength) designed to turn your money into a handful of tickets which can be used to purchase small amounts of candy and cheap plastic toys. I would have preferred more of the type of arcade games that turn my money into three-minute opportunities to play shiny new video games despite the fact that I already have hundreds of games purchased for Steam, PS3, Xbox One, and Wii U at home that I've never touched. Although they do have Alien vs Predator and a Jurassic World cabinet, so it's not all bad. Two ten year-olds were able to play a game of golf and get bored of the arcade games within an hour, which can be a blessing or a curse, depending on how long you intended on staying. For me, I wanted more."}
{"text":"Awesome place, if you haven't been the GO. We spent our Easter Sunday here and it was a blast."}
{"text":"Very clean and entertaining place for all ages.  Bowling, miniature golf and an arcade with a pretty decent food menu!"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times. Today we went on a Monday around 6. Def recommend that over a wknd, no wait for anything. We were able to bowl, get snacks, play games etc. This is a good place to get some play time in with the family. Most games are .50-1.00 each."}
{"text":"Love Fat Cats! Movie theater is great. Haven't tried the bowling area yet ... I always seem to come at a high volume time when they are booked...my fault, not theirs. Wasn't overly excited about the golfing but it was a good one time experience. The arcade area is growing and getting better. Overall, my daughter and I love it here and don't usually go anywhere else. :)"}
{"text":"We used our pogo passes to visit Fat Cats for the first time yesterday. We did \"glow golf\" first, which is indoor miniature golf under blacklights. The whole thing only took about 10 minutes for 9 holes, and we had to wait for awhile, as there were people in front of us and people behind. It was fun for my 3 year old, but it's not something I'd pay for. Next we did bowling. Their bowling set up is really nice, with huge tv's playing sports and big leather couches. It was a little awkward sitting at the same table as another family, who were using the lane next to us; they have separate couches, but one table to share in between, which takes up a lot of room. We ordered some wings, and macaroni and cheese for our 2 little ones; the wings were decent, but the mac and cheese was really awful, even my 1 year old wouldn't eat it and she eats everything. It was basically pasta with shredded white cheese, and a horrible aftertaste. The family at our table ordered a pizza and they said it wasn't the best. While the food may have been lacking, we were seriously impressed with the cleanliness of the entire facility, even the bathrooms were spotless and well stocked. It would be a fun place to go without kids; they have a movie theater with leather recliners, a full bar, and you can order food and drinks to your seat. We will definitely visit again, maybe without the kids this time for a date night!"}
{"text":"What a great place for family's and adults alike. So happy they brought this business to our neighborhood. We don't have kids but my wife and I enjoy this place for some fun and drinks. They have a happy hour too which is actually very good!"}
{"text":"Loved the theater, waited way to long (only one person at the register and he had to multi-task, watched two employees (looked like management) sitting at a nearby table who never got up to help. The very worst part; I ordered the panini and 30 minutes into the movie I got violently I'll. I couldn't wait to get home to the comfort of my own space. I will definitely go back to the theater but I WILL NOT be ordering any food."}
{"text":"You can chose your seats online & they're so comfortable! While waiting for a movie you can get a cocktail, play arcade games, bowl, or mini-golf! Make sure to give your self extra time for the snack line because it usually takes a little bit and you can't take your cocktail in the movie theater which is kind of a bummer. They will bring the food to you in your seat which is super convenient since the line takes awhile. Overall it is a great place to catch a movie!"}
{"text":"Great concept for indoor fun. Went here for the Indoor Mini-Golf. Had fun, but the course was too short. Will go back to try the dine-in movie theater and the arcade & games."}
{"text":"It was our first time here with my son. I had prepaid for the movie tickets online and I was impressed that you get to pick your own seats. No more rushing to get good seats. Once we arrived we ordered our food and headed over to our seats, once there our food was deliver right where we were seating! Talk about amazing specially when being a single mother things can get complicated!  Environment: Fun & Decent. Comfy Leather Chairs that Recline  Food: Good but not great Employees: Very nice & Helpful  The only reason I will be giving them a 4/5 stars is because the seats where we were seating could be cleaned out. It was sticky and dirty.  Otherwise its a nice place to come & distress for a bit.   P.S: They have $5 dollar movie tickets on Tuesdays!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here recently with the office and the events coordinator did an amazing job. We usually take the staff to Amazing Jakes but after our experience we can't wait to return. We scheduled a 2 hour event with food, drinks and bowling. We had 30 people but that wasnt a problem. The food was consistent with our expectations, we had salad, pizza, sandwiches, etc. During our bowling competition they definately engaged our competition. They added personal touches to the scoreboards, at the end of the event it was someones birthday. We brought a cake for a small celebration. Fat Cats was quick to bring us candles, lighter, plates, a microphone for speaking or singing. Again I am quite impressed with the organization and I cant wait to return and experience some of the other things inside!"}
{"text":"Fun place! Bowling, a bar, arcade, & recliner  seat movie theater. We come here, get a drink, then see a movie.  You can order pizza at the concession & they will bring it to your theater."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of tween girls for some quality time over golf and bowling. We had a blast!!! The bowling was more fun than glow golf IMO because you have your own lane and can play without interruption.  We did not finish Glow golf because the wait between holes was just too long. We did get some pizza at the end, which tasted much better than I anticipated. A fun time was had by all!"}
{"text":"can go wrong with reclining seat, w/ $5.00 tickets every tuesday. arcade  best way to spend time while you wait for the movies with your family"}
{"text":"I feel absolutely spoiled by place. All the bowling and arcade games are fun. My kids love it. I also will not watch a movie anywhere else. It's so nice to purchase tickets ahead of time and pick your seats. Then you can relax knowing you and your family will all have seats together. The seats recline and are so comfortable you could sleep in them."}
{"text":"Love going to see a movie here! Clean theaters, comfy reclining chairs and getting your food delivered to your seats is a plus! Pizza is yummy and my boys love their chicken tenders and sliders."}
{"text":"The mini golf is pretty lame, but the movie theater and bowling alley are great.  I love that The Soda Shop and Sweet Tooth Fairy are walking distance."}
{"text":"Had such a wonderful time here with the family as always!! We love that we get to see a movie and play games all in one visit. The prizes are great too. Big thank you to Dave who served us. Best customer service ever!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for movies, especially on Tuesdays. You cant beat 5 dlls any movie! Seats are somewhat comfy.. my only compliant is that the loyalty cup is 15 bucks!! Man too much for me.. come on fatcats bring the price down to 5 bucks!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Recline and Dine about three times now for movies.  I must say, most comfortable place to see a move EVER.  The 2nd time my husband and I went, we watched a movie all by ourselves, it was like a private screening, I hope business picks up so they stay in business, great concept.  This last time there were some glitches in service, we got our tickets, ordered a pizza, a large popcorn and an ICEE.  When we went and sat down, husband looked at popcorn and said, that can't be a large, so I took it back out to lobby and the manager stated it was indeed a medium and had them give me a large popcorn.  Movie started and the pizza never showed up, had to leave the movie and go down the pizza which was sitting at the takeout window, getting cold.  Apparently someone popped head in but never attempted to find us, we were in the correct seats.  That is nice about this place, you get to pick your seats.  Anyway, we watched our movie and as it ended, the manager came in and announced the movie experience was not up to their standards and so he was going to give everyone a free $10.00 gift card to make it up to us.  We had to ask him what was wrong with the movie, cause  we didn't even notice an issue with the \"quality\" of the movie, just problems with food orders.  Manager stated there was a black border line at the top of the screen that should not have been there and some fluctuations in lighting...either way, we will be back and will continue to enjoy putting our feet up for first run movie.  We haven't tried the bowling experience yet, but prices seem reasonable with a package deal for bowling, pizza and shoe rental all included for less that $70 for 4 people, I believe.  In regards to food, I tried one of the salads, which was delicious and people with me have ordered the pizza and said they are good, so give them a try!"}
{"text":"Love this place, especially for the $5 Tuesday movies but the concessions need some work.  They have messed up our order 75% of the time we have been, however the management seems to make it right but it is a bit of a hassle.  Otherwise fantastic place to hang out with the family."}
{"text":"Love fat cats! Good service, clean and fun. We went for a special screening of magic mike, and the service was on point.  We really liked the theater recliners.  We didn't bowl, yet, but we will be back for that"}
{"text":"So amazing, bowling,  glow in the dark mini golf, tons of arcade fun, bar, movies with reclined seating, tons of huge TV screens , the place is well designed. You can choose delivery service when your watching a movie! A really neat place for a date! Staff was super nice! One of my go to's"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and helpful  The facilities appeared to be clean and well maintained.   ... But the food we ordered was sub par. Our BBQ chicken pizza had about 3 pieces of chicken on it and wasn't very flavorful. The cuban sandwich was fair art best.  TL;DR: go for the movies skip the food"}
{"text":"Best location to see a movie in the East Valley.  Assigned reclining seats, in-theatre dining. Great spot four games, indoor golf, bowling if you have children. I recommend purchasing tickets online, as good shows sellout quick."}
{"text":"I've visited Fat Cats twice now for the movie theater! This theater is the only \"recline and dine\" I've ever been to, and the experience has been excellent both times. I love how comfy the seats are and that you pick them when you purchase them. The prices are also very fair!   We've ordered pizza and popcorn from the concessions. The pizza is delicious and a great value for $8 in comparison to other theaters. They deliver it to your seat! The popcorn is also excellent and fresh.  The employees were all very friendly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here and we loved it!  Very comfy reclining seats.  Some good tastes from the menu.  Very casual and a fun time had by all."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and a movie (Pixels). Was pleasantly surprised that the food was pretty good, service was wonderful and I LOVE the lounge chairs for the movie. Will definitely be back for more. Still need to take in the bowling and mini golf."}
{"text":"We just rented a Fat Cats theater to see Star Wars for a client appreciation event. It was fantastic! The seats are so comfortable, the visuals and the audio were great, and the concessions were delicious! Our clients seemed super happy to be there, and the ones who hadn't been there before were especially pleased to discover a great place to watch movies! My coworkers and I took the front rows so that we could save the \"good seats\" for our clients. However, the viewing experience even from the front row was awesome, especially with the reclining seats. As the event organizer, I also really appreciated Fat Cat's accommodating staff. Overall, it was a very successful event and I was really glad it all took place at Fat Cats!"}
{"text":"I love fatcats. Great place for family fun. I am not giving 5 stars because we went bowling yesterday and the server never came over in the hour that we had our lane. I noticed he was very busy so after 20 minutes I went to him and he would not take my order. He said he would come to my lane to get the order. He never did. By the time I gave up on him I went to order pizza next door but the line was so long I did not bother. If I did order, our lane time would be over before our pizza would have been done. Other then this one bad experience, everything else is great at fatcats."}
{"text":"We tried the show and dinner, but it's not like the camelback show and dinner concept. Food is delivered to your seat, but you need to eat off your lap as there are no trays. Ordered sandwiches and they were s greasy mess. I'd skip the food if you come here."}
{"text":"Loved the mini golf. Kids are 5 and 8 and we had a good time. It's a small glow in the dark miniature golf. Maybe 1/2 hour to do.  But prices are just right."}
{"text":"We just really like this place.  There is something for everyone, so long as you're looking to have fun.  I've seen adults by themselves, families, teenagers, etc.  Even the little ones have a good time.  And you can't go wrong with a full bar.  I just wish I could take alcohol into the theater.  But still a great place no matter."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a movie. Love the reclining seats and all the extra room compared to other theaters. Last time I went, I ordered pizza which was delivered to my seat. It was surprisingly good and inexpensive"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Fat Cats quite a bit lately to see movies instead of going to any other theater. This is because we love having recliners and reserved seating so that we do not have to worry about getting there early. And what makes this place even better is that it does not cost any more than any other regular theater."}
{"text":"We played mini golf, we went bowling and played in the arcade. Perfect place to be to beat the Arizona Heat. Friendly staff, was clean, and all arcade games were in working order. We didn't try the food or movie theater.. maybe next time."}
{"text":"A fun place to hang out at whether you're a child or an adult. There are quite a few things to do here including bowling, a cinema with recliner seats, a glow in the dark mini golf, arcades and party halls. I've pretty much tried everything here except the party halls.   Prices at the arcades are very cheap in comparison to similar places. There are some nice games and it's easy to get a card and recharge it, and guess what, it's free! If I remember correctly, I had to pay to get a card at Dave and Busters! The cinema is also charged reasonably and they have $5 tickets on Tuesday afternoons.   I have never tried the food there so I have no comment on that. My only negative here is that they have recently packed the stuffed animals so tight in my favorite game and the claw is flimsy and falls on its side when you try and grab any thing. Very disappointing for me since this is my absolute favorite game and I'm pretty good at it!   Overall, people who work here are courteous and you can get pretty good service. I will keep returning in hopes that my game will be fixed! I also like to watch movies here most of the time."}
{"text":"Went to FC using Pogo Pass. Was told they don't accept after 5 pm on Fridays.  They claimed they had no control over the rule, although they are clearly the beneficiaries of such a policy. NOWHERE on their website is this limitation. They've lost us as a customer forever. They could have easily recouped any \"loss\" of 5 mini golf passes, by any money we would have spent on food, games, etc. Bad management decision regardless of whose fault they claim it is.  Update: they contacted me saying they wanted to fix things. Gave them my contact info, weeks have gone by and still haven't heard anything."}
{"text":"I held my daughters 11th and 12th birthday party here, definitely a fun and affordable option. My favorite part is the bar - they really thought of everything. 4 star rating is just because the pizza isn't great and there has always been a machine down when we go. The customer service however, is amazing."}
{"text":"We had a birthday party for our 9 year old and Laura Short was our host. She was so good with the boys. The food was great and she kept them engaged throughout the entire party. The boys had a very good time. It was the easiest party ever. Laura was great and the facility was a perfect venue for this age. Highly recommend it. 2 thumbs up..!!"}
{"text":"Fun bowling & cute little arcade. It's a smart idea to call ahead if you have a larger group coming in, as they aren't always able to accommodate. They also have a movie theater that I've heard good things about."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite theater! The arcade isn't big, but it has enough to make it fun, and they are the fun games. My almost 2 year old had so much fun at the arcade. The pizza was actually good as well. We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Just had our daughter's 11th bday party here and it was a hit! Bowling party with pizza from they're in house restaurant--no ordinary pizza, it was delicious..handmade crust, might he been brick oven baked. Endless soda. Glow in the dark golf and then each kid received $5 for the arcade! Wonderful experience! And it's nice and clean!!"}
{"text":"Super nice young kids working here. Easy safe parking and a genuinely fun hangout for the kids. Off nights are not very crowded."}
{"text":"I had to log on to the PC for this one, cause I have a LOT to say! First, as you can see from most of my reviews, I typically Yelp to give praise and help fellow yelpers find good food and fun things to do... not this time! I asked my sister to buy Fat Cats gift cards for the boys for Christmas, we've been looking forward to checking this place out. Keep in mind, it is Tuesday, and we arrived at 5:15.  First problem, ticket machine was broken, searched for another one, it doesn't take gift cards. Stood in line (once we found it) 10 min. to get gift cards turned into their cards and a small popcorn to hold off for pizza for dinner while we bowl. Got two $10 cards --- gone in 10 minutes. Ok, let's trade our tickets in for prizes. Twenty + min later we got some junk from the toy counter.  Next, let's bowl! It's a Tuesday, so we checked out the lanes, five open lanes -- we should be good! We were the third family in line -- a completely haphazard line that was unidentifiable at this point. Waited. Waited. Waited. Walked up to the front and asked WTH is going on. Credit card machine is down, we're working on it. Checked back again with the gal at the register after 10 more minutes. Suddenly a family of NINE were in front of us saying they were called from a wait list?? Pardon? After 45 minutes it is our turn! Finally, bowling and dinner for my four and eight year olds. Nope. The gal says, \"are you on the wait list\"? WTF? Wait list for what? There are now 30 people behind me and I don't think any of us knew there was a wait list. Had I known anything about a wait list, I would have most definitely signed in an hour and a half ago when we arrived!  I asked for the manager/only adult in the understaffed building and pretty much lost my $hit. He didn't flinch, acted like there wasn't a problem. I handed him my card and let him know I needed a refund. He got the cash and handed it to me without so much as a \"sorry\" \"explanation\" NOTHING.  Needless to say, my four and eight year old boys were disappointed, but much better behaved than me!"}
{"text":"We love watching movies and enjoy the reclining seats. Four stars because several times our movies have been ruined because of loud, unruly children and I've never seen an usher.  Would like to see ushers come into the movies like they do in the big theaters. Food is decent, not spectacular but nice to have delivered to you."}
{"text":"I had my daughter's 10th birthday here. The girls had a blast. We had pizza inside Pizini and then we went into their amazing theater to watch Kung Fu Panda 3. I had 11 very happy girls. They loved the reclining chairs and comfy seats. After the movie they played games in the arcade. This my family's favorite place to watch movies as well as spend quality time together. We love the bowling alley and the arcade games.   Laura was our party host, as well as the person who helped us set up the event. She did a great job. The entire staff was friendly and made my daughter's day perfect!"}
{"text":"Only have been to the movie theatre. But you Pick your seats! $5 on Tuesdays! Large recliner seats with spacing equally between all other seats."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and a movie. Pizza was great and the theater is clean and comfortable with the reclining leather chairs."}
{"text":"My kids love it here. The movie seating is super comfortable with lazy boy loungers. The pizza is great ! The mini golf is a little small but it was still fun. We like that there are several things to do. We also have bowled here."}
{"text":"Great place for the family, good prices.  Staff was pretty friendly.  Nice that you can order food and have it brought to you"}
{"text":"Theater is phenomenal; nicest one over been to. Seats were clean, projector/screen were high quality, and the sausage pepper pizza was delish. We'd love to return, maybe we'll use our pogo pass for some bowling before the movie next time. Ps. $5 Tuesdays for movies and free large pop corn with online coupon!"}
{"text":"Love fat cats. One of our favorite places to take the kids to see a movie or bowling. Good times"}
{"text":"Went to see AntMan today! Took Mom and we had lunch at Pizini before the movie. We did buy our tickets and pick our seats before lunch. The cashier was not super welcoming, I had to ask where do we go? How do things work? At Pizini they seemed to be overwhelmed at the register, but the pizza and salad were fast and fresh! The pizza was thin and toasty, made in a brick oven! Once we got to our seats we were happy to see comfy leather recliners, it felt like I was at home! Movie was great, although during quite parts you could hear noise through the wall. I wasn't excited to see unattended children running around like crazy at the entrance either! I would go back for pizza and a movie, next time we will take pizza in to see the movie!"}
{"text":"I think fat cats is wonderful. Their Tuesday movies for $5 is a great deal and their specials for bowling with pizza are a great deal as well. The only fault I find with them is their pizza is small and kind of weird, but other than that, great deal and great place.   Oh, I almost forgot, their theaters are the nicest I have ever been to. Very comfortable recliner seats and very wide isles to walk and not trip.   All in all, I recommend Gat Cats to everyone!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my daughters 11th birthday..Molly was our event coordinator and she was great...pizza was okay but kids enjoyed it and there was no complaints... Definitely a good place to do party  We chose to do bowling and miniature golf... Kids had fun so it was worth it"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! the event staff that we used for a corporate event was VERY accommodating. Things went ultra smoothe. we had a party of about 50 and they took care of every thing. From the Movie that we all attended to the bowling and arcade, it all made for a great event. Fun for all of the guests, outstanding food, wings brick oven Pizza, all at a price that was better them comparable venues. The staff is the best we have ever had at a corporate event. Melissa, Celeste, Shannon and Michael. Great safe environment for all ages. Luxury cinema with food and beverages. Dancing in the isles. Wow, we will definitely be back.  I highly recommend this place for corporate events!"}
{"text":"This has become our to go place for movies. The ability to pre-purchase reserved seats is awesome. No more getting to the theater an hour before the movie in hopes of getting good seats. The recliners and some of the food is a plus. However.... some of the menu items need to be improved in quality. I am willing to pay a bit more if the food was better quality. For example: I got a pretzel, it was old, stale, and so covered in salt it was inedible. Some of the food is good, not great, just passible for the price. I have resorted to smuggling in my own food from the outside. Even with the drawbacks in the poor food quality, the location does receive a 4 star raking from me and my family. Comfort, reserved seating, and great location."}
{"text":"Nice enough. But we will never go back. The location is great, and fun things to do, but it doesn't make up for how rude some of the people were to the kids. One employee yelled at one of the kids in our group for using \"too much strength\" on the strength tester game, and at another child because he was playing with one of the window stick toys at the window.  We found it inappropriate that he would do so instead of speaking calmly to the children or to the adults (who were standing right there). Especially since four out of ten kids got yelled at while we were there. (And there were eight adults watching the children, so the children were not unattended.)"}
{"text":"Diet Coke - great seats you can reserve! We've been here many times. They have the bowling though it seems like the lanes are too narrow for some reason - not sure if it is literally true but it feels that way. Good for kids because of all the games but we really only come for movies."}
{"text":"Cute place to play. The mini golf is fun and the game are new. We haven't done bowling. Would be cool to have for a party for kids. Unfortunately the place is pretty pricey so that's not so great.  But the food is good. We had some of the pizzas and chicken salad. Great to go when it's not busy."}
{"text":"Went to Fat Cats in Gilbert for the first time tonight and will never be back. Bought movie tickets and ordered food which we were told would be delivered to us during the movie.  45 minutes later... no food.  Went out three times to figure out what happened to our food. Kept being promised that we'd have our food soon. An hour and twenty minutes after ordering went out again a fourth time and was finally given our lukewarm pizzas. At this point we'd missed most of the movie so we asked for our money back so we could just leave. Initially they just wanted to give us a  $10 gift card so we could try them again. Had to explain that we'd never be back and finally got our money back for movie rickets and pizza  (but not the popcorn we had to buy to have something to eat during the interminable wait). Lots of other choices for movies in Gilbert - anywhere is better than this place."}
{"text":"Well, the people were very nice and that is why I'm giving them the 2 stars.  The seating was pretty comfortable too, but what I had a problem with is that the restaurant, Pizini, or whatever it is, failed to deliver our food during the movie.  It amazed me that they took both of our tickets and wrote down the seat numbers and still failed to follow through!  I was upset that when our movie let out and we went over to the restaurant that the guy who took our order was already off.  We did get our refund, but imagine waiting for food that never came?  It made for a horrible experience.  Sure, it's cheaper than AMC Cinema Suites, but as far as the food service, it's pretty horrible."}
{"text":"It's great that there's an arcade, mini golf course, bowling alley, and theatre all in one place. Unfortunately, the place is dirty, the service has been poor on several occasion. The food is cheap and awful. I ordered sliders and they were raw, I sent them back and it took 30 min. to get a new order. Half the arcade machines are broken. One arcade machine was beeping loudly and it continued for hours. No one shut it off or anything."}
{"text":"I love that I can reserve my seats, I can play arcade games with my daughter while waiting for the movie to start, that the seats are all electric recliners, and that employees can bring us hot food to our seats while we enjoy the movie."}
{"text":"So new place for the fam to try, but it may become the all for one place for us, movies, bowling and arcade games, oh my. It's open, clean and super fun... can't wait to play here more ... oh and the food looks yummy too ... the cheese pizza is nice and cheesy and can't wait to come back again!! #lfthx #fatcatsfun"}
{"text":"First off I must say WOW are the reclining chairs in the theatre comfortable. Best in the valley maybe. Pizza was solid and very well priced. Other fare is priced nicely from what I saw as well. Service was outstanding and the bartender was great and knew his product. Ok to good beer selection. There is only one thing keeping this from being a 5 star review and that is the inability to take beer or alcohol into the theatre. That being said, for the target market - families - that's probably a wise choice. If you want a great movie or entertainment experience in the east valley definitely give this place a shot. Did I mention the staff was incredible and friendly?"}
{"text":"The best experience EVER. This is the second time I had my grandkids bday parties.   Thank you Laura for making BOTH grandkids bdays amazing."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow. On three different occasions and spots throughout the venue, employees had left that station and was not attending to anyone in places like the concession stand or the prize area. Very cool place but the staff could improve."}
{"text":"Attended a company holiday party here.  It was so warm inside it was almost unbearable.  Food was provided and was pretty tasty.  The staff was friendly and responsive to our large parties needs.  We ordered tap beer and it could have been colder but it was good.  Very clean, will definitely bring the family back for some fun.  We did find that the bowling lanes were very sticky.  Staff exchanged our shoes and polished our lane but it made for our bowling experience mediocre.  However the staff was very attentive, just unable to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"A great establishment with great entertainment. The lanes are always kept up and the seating is nice as well."}
{"text":"Took grand kids (age 5 & 6) and had a great time.  Played video games.. they all worked! So many places have broken ones.  Fun, newer games too.  Kids loved it.  We didn't bowl or golf but plan to go back and do that.  We did have pizza and it was really good.,. better than I expected.  The place is very clean.  $1 a game I guess is reasonable these days.    They do have special pricing for different price points.  Great experience.   We will back!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't fun... My friend and I planned to come here with high expectations but when we walked in we were both instantly bored. We came with $150 but only ended up spending $25 on food and golf. The golfing was boring and we were going to bowl but we thought \"why waste money on bowling, listening to terrible 2009 music when we can go to an actual bowling alley like usual and have more fun?\" I'm honestly never going to come back. We ended up going outside and sitting in front of the restaurant for an hour in the heat and had more fun than we did inside. It was funny because we would look at everyone going in and we'd see them come out 10 minutes later."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. Cheaper than Harkins. Better pricing. Better food. You can reserve your seats and when someone was sitting in our seats they took care of it so we didn't have to. I doubt we will visit any other theater as long as they exist."}
{"text":"For movies, I love it! The mini golf is okay. Bowling is fun. The arcade games are pricey, Wednesday's are doable because they are half price. The pizza is horrible ! Horrible crust, very small. I don't recommend the pizza at all! The drinks are a bit pricey also. Sneak in water!"}
{"text":"Great place to see a movie in nice recliner seats. Order online but it costs 3 bucks to do so. Tuesday is awesome at 6 bucks a seat for any movie and any time. The food is ok and can be expensive, but better than just pizza. Staff is friendly. They could really take this place to the next level with an adult only venue or event. Use road house cinema as a reference. Cool place for the kids to bowl and play arcade games too. They show sports and music videos on massive screens, but its really small. Take the family and enjoy. And you may need to wait for a ticket taker to show up at the door so just walk in."}
{"text":"This review is for the Movie Theater only. My friend and I saw Batman vs. Superman. We loved the size of the screen, great surround sound and the reservable leather power recliners makes it feel like I am in a living room, very comfy! It's my new favorite Theater!!"}
{"text":"Came back to take my in law to a movie. Was a good experience, and everyone was friendly and helpful. Just a couple issues that knocked down my star rating.   1. Checked in and got a check in offer of a free large popcorn. Shawn Finch (MOD) gave us a FIRM FYI that we must print out the coupon next time. Um....ITS A CHECK IN OFFER!! I have to check in and be at your business before I can even redeem the offer. Am I suppose to go home and print it out and then come back? Don't offer a check in offer if you do not understand how it works. He allowed it \"this one time.\"   2. Hard to find seat numbers when Theater is dark. Our whole row was shifted down too far because people were confused. Row letters are lit, but seat numbers are not. Yes...I am the dummy for showing up late.   3. Sound was lacking. Kind of sounds like a good home theater system, not a cinema.   Lastly....I still prefer Harkins. I know...I know...how could I not love the comfy recliners. It's just, Fat Cats is great, but it's does not give me that cinematic adventure I am seeking after. It just does not feel like a theater in a weird way.   Overall, still a great place!"}
{"text":"Great time with the family tonight.  Bring the family to Thunder Alley! The DJ and Host TuShawn( probably spelled wrong) was a great entertaining host."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by the food, plus there are no trays to put your food when eating in the dark theater which makes for messy eating. I may give this place anotger try, as it was not awful. It just was not the best experience I have had. I think I prefer the traditional way of having dinner after the movie."}
{"text":"We took our 6 and 2 year old for a bit of fun today, and it was fantastic! Though the initial employee we spoke to (maybe his name was Gabe) was a DB (I have no alternative more articulated words to describe his poor attitude), we had a wonderful time!!  The food was pretty good (though it is pricey, you get a lot of food), and the service was great! Skip the mini-golf. It's a little chaotic and a bit of a free for all!  I actually think this place could with stand a major expansion. It was packed to the point of being a bit over crowded.   It blows CEC and PPP out of the water as far value goes. The arcade gives a ton of tickets, and ticket to prize ratio is well thought out. I think we spent $50 on games and had almost 1300 tickets to redeem.  Oh... GO HERE INSTEAD of Amazing Jake's! That's for sure!"}
{"text":"The bowling was fun although I wish I figured out the time vs. Game pricing. We had 2 kiddies with us and only managed to get through a game after eating at the lane and whatnot.   The miniputt was a bit disappointing not that we had planned to partake but it was pretty sad deal if peeps are going there solely for the puttputt.  I had fun playing the games, I also happened to have the cash to blow. I suppose a lot of these places tend to be pretty highly priced for the amount of time it takes to blow through the money on the card. I suppose renting of the space and employees cost a lot and so 1.75$ for a game helps out.  There was one game that I ended up doing pretty well on and wasn't able to play it again. Although, our second card allowed another player... Again, I guess they don't really want people to win huge time and time again...  Won't go out of the way to head back but will absolutely be a little more wise with the bowling selection next time."}
{"text":"I had no idea?!!  Fat Cats is so fun & affordable!  We had a day off from school and decided to head over and bowl a game or two.  Not only is the bowling affordable the video games is the best deal around!   You can get a TON of game play for an affordable price!  Next time we'll plan our time better so we can catch a movie, bowl , and play video games.  So incredibly worth it!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place to watch a movie. First off, the seats are fantastic. We are used to going to regal in downtown Gilbert. The chairs here are recliners but also very comfortable with a lot of padding. It's also nice to pick your own seat. They have a special on popcorn if you check in using Yelp. The bad news is that it is a little pricy compared to other theaters. They don't offer a student discount either. All in all, it was a good experience and they will be in the running next time we go to see a movie."}
{"text":"Really fun place with tons of things to do. Glow in the dark mini golf was fun besides the little kids behind us rushing us because they couldnt play by any sort of rules properly."}
{"text":"This place is way fun I wish they had one in california. Fun for the whole family bowling, theater, arcade, bar, food. Everything you need to have a great time. I would highly recommend for family of all ages."}
{"text":"We wanted to throw a surprise party for our 17 year old son, and Fat Cats was the perfect venue for it. Their events department was very welcoming and helpful, so kudos to Laura and Bailey for that.  We chose the TopCat Bowling package, which costs $20 pp. (it's slightly more expensive on weekend nights and there are other packages to choose from)The price includes a lot: pizza, drinks, balloons and paper goods, 90 minutes of bowling, one round of mini golf, and a $5 arcade card for guests. (Also a tee-shirt for the birthday child.) You have a designated party host, and Elizabeth did a fantastic job of making sure everyone was taken care of, handling the pizza, birthday treat distribution and group photo. She also kept the area neat and clean.  Now that my son is almost off to college, there weren't many appealing places to hold his party. He has outgrown places like Bounce U and Krazy Air, and his crowd isn't really the Airsoft type. Main Event is good, but a much longer drive for all of our northeast Mesa friends. If you're looking for a good party spot for your teen, I really think Fat Cats meets your needs."}
{"text":"Went to Fat Cats for the first time on a Tuesday night for the $5 movies they have. This place was packed! Who knew?! We purchased tickets online ahead of time and got to picks our seats. This was very nice since we didn't have to run to the theater to find a good seat. We got a bag of popcorn and the young lady at concessions was very friendly and sweet. Great first impression. We went to our theater and the young man checking tickets was very friendly as well. So far so good! The theater was nice and the seats that reclined was a very big perk. We had a blast! We will come back for sure and bring the kiddo next time for the bowling and arcade.  Only down fall was that alcohol wasn't allowed in the theater area. I was a bit disappointed by this as it was would be very nice to drink a glass of wine on girls night and laugh at the movie."}
{"text":"Great time. Food was great. Beer was good. Theatre is awesome and very clean. I take my girlfriend here as much as i can for movies and next time we go were gonna be trying the mini golf that looks like a ton of fun"}
{"text":"Came here for a class bowling night and had a blast! It's modern, has screens all over and fun music. Definitely family friendly. Also has games and movies on site."}
{"text":"Drove by several times without really realizing exactly what it was.  After going to their movie theater, I will never go back to normal chain theaters near me.  Seats recline and are very comfortable.  Food is decent, and remarkably cheap for a movie theater setting.  Kids meal is only $5 or $6 and includes pizza, drink and cookie.  Also have $5 Tuesday which makes this a very affordable family outing.  Favorite part is that I can pick seats prior to purchase, so I don't have to worry about getting there an hour ahead of schedule for new releases."}
{"text":"Darcie and I love catching movies here. It's actually rare now for us to go elsewhere for a movie.   It's clean, the staff is courteous and friendly, very reasonably priced, and it's oh so comfy.   Key steps to success:   1. Buy advance tickets using the Fat Cats online ticketing to reserve optimal seating   2. Arrive 15-20 minutes ahead of screening time*   3. Buy Popcorn and Drinks   4. Find your seat.   5. Recline and prepare for transport!  Yeah baby! Wash, rinse, repeat as needed.  A note on the food ---- It is convenient to be able to order food and have it delivered to you as you are reclining in the theater. But, in truth, I have found the food to be lacking on the 3 occassions I have ordered some. Give it a go. Your mileage may vary. The chicken strips are OK, if a bit overdone and rubbery. The Pizza, however, is down right awful... exercise caution.  To Fat Cats Owners and Management: The deficiencies cited above are very correctable. You guys could really knock this gig out of the park with an increase in food quality. I'm just itchin' to give you that fifth STAR.  These days the only justifiable reasons NOT to go to FatCats are:   - IMAX format preferred for the movie  or   - Movie not Showing at Fat Cats.  In conclusion: Thank you Fat Cats for being so awesomely awesome. I forgive you for your nasty pizza. Love ya bunches anyway! See you soon.  * You may need to arrive earlier during peak hours... we tend to watch movies before noon on Sundays... In Mesa/Gilbert, that's an off peak sweet spot."}
{"text":"The place is fun as long as their computers don't go down before hand or during your visit. We waited in line to be told they couldn't sell us anything or let us use any of the attractions. I kindly asked if we could play a round of mini golf while they fixed their issue and pay when finished and was told no. Finally got the bowling alley up and running and purchased a lane but there was no music and the TV's at the end of the lanes were touch and go. Heard all of the movies that were showing shut down during their computer issues which made the whole place worthless.  I imagine if things were working it would be a great place for the the family but they need to get a better back up plan in place if they continue with the computer issues."}
{"text":"This is a great place for everyone.  So much to do. Great movie choices and recliners to make it enjoyable.  Lots of games and food."}
{"text":"First time at Fat Cats was a success. I have lived literally 5 minutes from this place for several years now and finally made it in. My friends and I had dinner down the road and wanted to do something fun after we ate, so we thought, \"why not bowl?\" However, we did not end up bowling. Saturday nights this place is hoppin'. So instead of waiting to maybe potentially get to bowl (because they do unlimited bowling) we decided to glow golf instead. A lot cheaper. There are only 9 holes, but it's fun and passes some time. They allow you to take drinks with you through the glow golf course.  After glow golf, we played some arcade games. They have a lot of similar games to other establishments in their classification. A couple of games aren't kept up and so they aren't working and basically cost me a few extra credits, which is lame and my reason for 4 starts instead of 5. The prize selection isn't that great, but at 27 my only interest in their prizes are candy.   It is a cute place. Movies are comparable to other theatre prices and they do $5 movies on Tuesdays. I would love to try bowling here at some point, probably not on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Awesome movie theater!! Electric reclining reserved seats. Affordable pricing on food and snacks with free drink refills starting as low as $2.00. Highly recommend watching movies here."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome! We went on a rainy day. Bowling, movie theatre, food, arcade and the best part GLOW IN THE DARK MINI GOLF  Not to mention its pirate themed! They play 'a pirates life' etc while you play among painted sharks, dolphins, octopuses, starfish etc it's all so awesome. The kids loved it!  The course is 9 holes. My family of 4 (2 kids 2 adults) played for $15 and it took about 15 min.  We got popcorn and an icee while we played. I loved being able to have movie theatre popcorn without seeing a movie. They let you bring your food into the golf area as well.   We played a few arcade games after but decided to skip the ticket exchange for toys process because of how long the line was. There was two younger people behind the counter I think it would have been much faster with one or two more people behind the counter.   Overall, this place is awesome I recommend it for kids or a fun date night!"}
{"text":"Love it. Inexpensive. Good place to hangout with your friends. Music is okay. Employees are very helpful when u need assistance. Also a great place to bring your family as well."}
{"text":"I went to my grandson's 7th birthday party on Saturday, October 22nd. The atmosphere was very inviting. They were doing renovations so we were not able to sit in the normal accommodations for a birthday party. They had instructed all of the parents to sit at the bar, however; we pulled up other chairs in the main room at the children's table. Drinks were not given to the adults. We had to purchase them which was unusual as I have attended other birthday parties and they were always included. The were normally served in a picture  but at Fat Cats  they were  served  at the fountain . We went to a movie. We enjoyed it. They had enough staff for the party. There were plenty of games and arcades. We would definitely go again."}
{"text":"We LOVE Fat Cats!  They have movies (with recliners), bowling, glow in the dark golfing, arcade and more!  Our experience has always been stellar!  Never had any issues- great seats, great movies!  The app and website are perfect.  The pizza delivered to your chair is delicious and always eaten even with picky kids (adults too).  If you are looking for a great date night or family fun/ this place has it all!"}
{"text":"The arcade is extremely lame. If you're looking for a fun arcade, you should probably save yourself the drive and look elsewhere. My friends in I were there for less than 5 minutes. Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is great. Lots of activities for the family that will not cost you an arm and a leg to enjoy.  Bowling and food are way inexpensive compared to Main Event and Flip Side.  The movie theaters are a plus, they have nice recliners with a lot of leg room.  You get to pick your own seats and the prices are cheaper than Harkins.  I do like the free refills of soda.  We also had a birthday party for my son.  Melisa, our host and event manager, provided us with excellent service.  Get the package that provides bowling, pizza, and glow in the dark golf. It's worth it.  Overall this is my new place to watch a movie, no worries about finding a seat just buy them ahead of time.  This place is still under the radar that's why the theaters are not so packed but eventually it will get there."}
{"text":"It's hard to book an event or any kind of information from this place because no one answers the phone not a good thing when you're first starting out in business"}
{"text":"This place was so chaotic. We went on a weekday night when the credit card machines were down so I'm not sure if that was the explanation for the awful experience. The customer service was awful, no one knew what they were doing. Long lines with zero organization. I will definitely never go back."}
{"text":"Great place for the whole family!  They have a variety of activities! Mini golf, bowling, movies, and arcade area. They offer Tuesday $5 movies and I like how you can buy tickets online and reaver your seats!  Parking can be hard on Saturday's but during the week it's less crowded and easier to park."}
{"text":"Went to watch a movie here and the guy sold me a ticket to the wrong movie before the issue could be corrected the movie started but they were very apologetic compensated me for my food ticket and gave me a free beverage. Can't beat that customer service! Awesome place to go play some games with your kids and catch a movie, food is actually pretty good for a place like this. They only have a small theater so make sure they are playing the movie you want before heading out!"}
{"text":"Fun time! Took my 6 yr old here for indoor mini golf the other day to escape the humidity. Only 9 holes but it was perfect for my lil man and myself as well!  It was crowded but that didn't bother us too much. Gave us time to really enjoy ourselves at the slower pace due to several groups ahead of us"}
{"text":"The pizza here is declining by the visit! We came here for a birthday party while that was fun and all I feel that the service could have been a bit better.   Kids Pizza pack: I have notice that the cookies in the kids meal is bigger than the pizza. For kids that might be awesome but as a parent I want more bang for my buck!   Pizza: is it me or have the Pizza's gotten smaller?!?! My family has been visiting this location since it opened and the most drastic thing I can say is the pizza are much smaller than they where upon opening. I paid $9-10.00 for a two topping pizza that has very little cheese and toppings but had a ton of sauce. What I was eating yesterday seems more like bread sticks in the shape of a pizza. I will also recommend not ordering to go...I had my pizza home in under 5 minute and the pizza was countertop cold...like it had been sitting there a few hours! At this rate I would have been better off with a hot and ready and saved money! Go forward, I will have to skip out on Fat Cat's pizza not worth the money."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place. Always a good time. It is a little expensive though so be warned. Do you go on a Friday or Saturday night it can be pretty busy also. The recline and dine cinemas are probably the best part"}
{"text":"Check in to get your tickets is the usually short line.  We missed about 10 minutes of the movie, even though we got there with plenty of time (or so we thought) because the concession lines moved at the speed of nothing (there was only one person tending to that area).  Once inside the theater, it was hard to find our seats.  The chair are comfy, though.  I might give them a try once more to see if the experience is better the second time around."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER ... and much more!!  Salads are great. Lots of choices for adults and kids. Delicious. Reasonable pricing. Cher T., General Manager is personable and very attentive to guests making sure EVERYTHING is perfect. Service is exceptional by all staff -- smiling , polite and efficient. Order is ready AND served in a flash.  Lots of places to go for pizza -- but fat Cats /  Pizini - Gilbert is the BEST !  Rick & Peggy S."}
{"text":"AMAZING PLACE! Such great customer service and the funnest bowling, arcade games and CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE THEATERS! The seats are so comfortable it's almost hard not to fall asleep during the movie haha. You can even order your food during the movie! I LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot! I didn't check this place out for some time as I was under the impression it was another kid-oriented place. Since we don't have kids, we passed by and ignored it for months. We went bowling with family and I found I couldn't be more wrong. This place caters to everyone. There is a full bar, mini golf, movie theater, arcade, and bowling. Bowling is awesome here, a lot of nights they offer unlimited for a under $20/person with shoes. Drinks are decently priced as well."}
{"text":"Came here on a work event. The place is fantastic, clean and the employees are all professionals. Food is average, the usual pizza and salad, their panini sandwiches were great tasting, especially the chicken pesto. If I lived closer, I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Cher really made our experience so much better today.  Our 4 year old was having a rough time as he was over stimulated, hungry, and he skipped his nap. So a fun time was deteriorating into a crying mess.  Cher came to our table and noticed my son's teary eyes. First, she got him to talk to her directly which is impressive in itself. Then she had a whole conversation with him about how he needed to eat his food and then he could play mini golf.  Then she gave us a card worth $5 for games so that he could play a bit more.  It was such a nice thing that she didn't have to do but it improved things so much.  We have been here a few times and we will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Best place to see movies. I always go to $5 Tuesday's but you have to order online three days ahead of time to see new movies on tuesdays. Still very clean and the pizza and sliders are great! They even deliver food to your seat in the theater!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is a great place! We planned my sons 8th birthday party somewhere else and it wound falling through last minute. We called and spoke with Laura (the bday party coordinator) and she had a table set, balloons out and everything ready for us in FIVE MINUTES notice. She acted like it was a breeze and was so helpful. She got all of the kids names for bowling written down and remembered them the rest of the time, calling each by name. She was FANTASTIC. We have enjoyed playing in the arcades or watching movies here before, but I'm blown away by the level of service and fun we were met with for my sons birthday party. And with nearly no notice at all!! I wish I could give 6 stars for such an amazing party hostess."}
{"text":"Best place on the east side to see movies without a doubt! Prices are good, popcorn is good, seating is great, and free drink refills!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this movie theater so much, I don't think I'll return to a Harkins or AMC any time soon (unless my movie of choice isn't playing there).  The assigned seating alone is enough of a reason.  We got there about 45 minutes before the movie started, bought our tickets, and were able to enjoy a beer before the movie started.  A great experience overall.  I give it four stars because I could hear the bowling alley music while watching the movie... I'd recommend a little more sound-proofing on the exit doors in the movie theaters.  Nitpicky on my part, but still.. it was distracting.  We will be back though, very soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to go to in Gilbert; It's clean, fun, and usually not super busy. The movie theatre is comfortable and the bowling has competitive prices. During my last visit Ralph at the front desk was great. He was very friendly and deserves some recognition for his work ethic."}
{"text":"Great place to go with the kids! The movie theater is great, it's clean and the food is good."}
{"text":"Best kept secret ever on Tuesday nights you can get five dollar movie tickets and they have a happy hour Monday through Friday from 3 to 6 and you can get Coors light and Bud Light for two dollars draft they have reclining seats and they will bring you food to your chair you reserve your seat ahead of time so you really don't need to go into the movie until the movie time and all the previews are over if you don't want to Staff is very friendly place is very clean and well-kept"}
{"text":"I took my husband, daughters, niece and nephew here to see Trolls. They all had a great time playing in the arcade and loved the reclining seats. The movie wasn't great, and I actually fell asleep for most of it. I don't usually fall asleep in movie theaters, but the chair was so comfortable! We ate before we went, so I can't say much about the food. If I were going to be in town longer, I'd take my nieces and nephew back to try the glow-in-the-dark mini golf and some bowling."}
{"text":"Me, my husband, and our son came here for a game of bowling for our annual birthday extravaganza day. Our 4-turning-5 year old requested bowling as one of his chosen activities for the day. We decided to go to Fat Cats to check it out, even though we live smack between this place and Brunswick. I was a little hesitate because of the reviews, and I should have listened to them.  We showed up at around 1 on a Friday. There were two families ahead of us in line, but the first family was finishing up as we walked up. The second family was next. They proceeded to chat the guy at the register up and was clearly in no hurry. Neither were we, so we were patient. Patient, that is, until about 10 minutes later and we were still standing there with an anxious kid waiting to bowl. The annoying part is there were TWO other employees behind the counter that could have easily helped us but they were busy doing other stuff.  Finally, 15 minutes later, the family walks away. Does the guy at the register help us immediately? NO! Not even a glance up. He turns and starts talking to another employee. 3 minutes goes by and I'm telling my husband that we should just leave. Instead, he walks up to the guy and says \"Are you ready to help us yet?\" He says \"oh yeah just a minute, but he has to help you on that register over there\". What?? Why did we just wait so long for YOU to help us on THIS register if that other dude can do it?  Ultimately the same kid ended up helping us on the other register. To be fair, he was very polite but the whole experience was really lacking. Next, we bowled. It was as expected and uneventful. The couches and table were a very nice touch. I like that. My husband was annoyed that the lanes were so much smaller than normal. I personally didn't care.  Before we left my son wanted to play some games at the arcade. Loading a gift card was ridiculous difficult. The machines have conflicting instructions on which way is the correct way to insert your card and times out on you. Going up to the counter for help was impossible because of the CONSTANT line. Once you finally get a card to use, scanning those into the insanely overpriced games is difficult.  Overall, we will absolutely never come back here. We spent more time in line and trying to deal with their crappy technology than we did having fun. The experience was awful, and it doesn't seem like they care because there are multiple reviews complaining about the same thing. Clearly the employees aren't taking them seriously. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I freakin love FatCats! I brought my niece and nephew here yesterday and they had a blast in the arcade, even if they are a bit stingy with the tickets. Then we saw Lego Batman - so much fun! Love getting chicken fingers brought to my seat during the movie!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. My boyfriend & I always make this our date night location. It has everything you can think of to make it a fun date night. Before we start playing we stop by the bar for some drinks & food. The bartender Sean is hands down the best bartender I've ever had! We look forward to seeing him. I'm excited to see the finished arcade. Nothing but good things to say about this place."}
{"text":"Great place to catch a movie  Been to Fat Cats for several movies over the last couple of months and every visit has been great.  Comfortable seating and reasonable prices on tickets and food.   Haven't tried out the rest of the place yet, but will soon"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great place to see a movie or have some fun with friends. Great place for the whole family!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are very pleased with the cinema. We will have to go back and see how we feel about the rest of the establishment but I like that it seemed to be a good mix and more upgraded version of amazing Jakes. We are excited to return."}
{"text":"I really like Fat Cats in Gilbert. The wife and kids go out of their way to pick movies here when it's movie night.  I am 6'5 and a bigger guy. The seats are extremely comfortable and I like that they recline. I love that we can go online and reserve seats also, since when we do go it is with our entire family and the kids friends usually. When we get there we don't need to mess around with talking or waiting in line. I can just go to the machine and print off our tickets I bought online. The parking area can be crowded and hard to find a space at times.    The food is pretty average and I think could use an upgrade on quality.  They have quite a bit to offer there for \"fun\" . Arcades, bowling etc. I haven't used anything but the movie portion so I really can't comment to much on that part.  Tuesdays are $5 per movie, all day. Awesome since I am off on Tuesdays. It kind of sucks to go alone, but I like the price.  I wish this was a nationwide chain, but executives would find a way to really screw it up or some foreign company would buy it and probably ruin it, and then I would have to search for another gem to entertain me."}
{"text":"Had a get together with business partners and friends! Had a great time for our small group of 30 . Friends , food and bowling and a couple of drinks . The kids got to play, also! A win/win/win for all."}
{"text":"My husband and I went with another couple for a date night and it was fun, but more could have been better about it. The bowling balls did not have different sized finger holes for the sized balls, so if you want to have your fingers fit properly you have to get very heavy balls. My friend and I both had issues with our fingers getting stuck in the balls (size 6 and 5.5 ring sized fingers for reference). It kinda ruined the experience. But, it was still fun and a cool atmosphere! Another down fall was that they had us wait about 15 minutes for a lane but when we finally got a lane we noticed there were a ton of empty lanes that we could have used earlier. Besides those couple little details, it was still a fun night with friends."}
{"text":"First and last time visiting back and we will go to main event entertainment or anyplace else this place focuses on birthdays in the movies doesn't really take care of the customers who want to do more than one activity no discounts no group discounts and no package deal if you want to spend more than a couple hours here don't waste your time don't waste your money go someplace else"}
{"text":"We went to Fat Cats for a movie this Saturday. I love the leg room and reclining seats, but the concession stand is on the outside of the ticket taker so you have to leave the movie area and show your ticket to get back in. They call it recline and dine, but you can't bring alcohol past the ticket booth and the recliners aren't really suited to \"dining\". We will definitely go back since the ticket prices are cheaper than Harkins where you feel like you're in the 3rd class deck of the Titanic.   Biggest complaint? The armrests are all stationary so you can't sit close to Bae. If you want a good date place, try Cinemark at Mesa Riverview."}
{"text":"Clean, convenient, friendly this is how a movie theatre should be run! The bathrooms were super clean on a slammed Saturday, ordering tickets online, not having to wait in a line to get in and get there early to have to hope it's not sold out; I love it!! Got there right at the movie time, walked right in and went right to my seat.... awesome.   I see a few bad reviews (from some business experts... just kidding, morons is more like it) and read some of those other people's reviews of other businesses... you can tell by their bad attitudes and over analysis (like they could run a business any better... laughable), why they post their gibberish!   This place rocks... bye bye Harkins, AMC, Regal"}
{"text":"This is not hyperbole, March 2nd I had the absolute worst theater experience in my 30 years of living.   First let me say that movies are my passion, I get involved and when momentum of films are completely destroyed, it destroys the movie experience for me.   I was catching the 7pm showing of Logan, which tied with Episode VIII is my most anticipated movie of the year. There were unruly guests sitting in the seats to the right of my viewing party and I will go into more detail later, but since that isn't something FatCats can completely control, it's not the focus of this message.   During the climax and resolution, towards the ending of the movie, where all the drama is wrapping up, the emotional core of the film, the house lights come on. This was incredibly distracting and led to the entire theater chattering and wonder what was going on. As the movie continued for a couple minutes in a fully lit auditorium the house lights then turned off and the movie rewound about 10 minutes. This utterly destroyed the momentum of the narrative and in doing so the entire theater felt it appropriate to just freely talk. So now, not only was the momentum destroyed but the audience's attention is all but lost. As we reach the fateful moment, the house lights came on AGAIN in the same spot, much to the chagrin of audience. This caused the audience to chatter even louder, so even though I am seeing a bulk of this scene for a second time I am still not getting the entirety of it thanks to the plethora of distractions. This time the movie continued with house lights on, which as it turns out only had 30 seconds remaining anyway,   What was worse was the way the manager treated guests as we approached the desk. We were given 10 dollar gift cards to the arcade. Which is weird because I didn't have a bad arcade experience. I had no idea why we weren't given movie passes to see the movie at a later date, this time without the technical problems. Now it was a nice gesture and that didn't go unnoticed by me, however a handful of other patrons felt the way I did. We don't frequent the Arcade or Bowling Alley, which I am sure are a hoot, but I was there to see and enjoy a movie, which was obstructed due to technical difficulties. So when the manager reaches the table and I kindly explained that I would prefer either a refund or compensation for the Movie, after rolling his eyes and puffing he throws another gift card on the counter with attitude instead of to my extended hand saying \"This is $20, is that good enough?\".    No, it wasn't and it's not because I wanted more money, I wanted to be treated with understanding and respect considering that a movie I paid to see was ruined because of technical difficulty. I'm not an unreasonable guy, I know that technical difficulties happen but this certainly wasn't what I paid money for. What did I do to deserve a bad attitude? Because I was in a situation with many other people where it would be impossible to have been satisfied? Imagine if I bought a bluray and the last part of the movie was scratched or kept skipping, is it unreasonable to ask for a replacement? No and certainly wouldn't expect a condescending attitude.   I can't recommend this facility. I understand this could be an isolated incident and perhaps it happens one in thousand screenings, which would be outstanding odds. The problem is the staff didn't care to prove that these things rarely happen. The staff didn't seem to care to have me come back and make up for the poor visit. I didn't want or expect anything more than just the movie refunded or replaced and when that was explained, I was treated like I was the jerk. Not only was this the worst movie going experience I have had but possibly one of the poorest customer service experiences I have had. The \"manager\" seemed put out at the notion of relating to customers, much less indicate any ounce of empathy to the situation. Instead I was treated like I did something wrong.   I think the only thing I did wrong was chose to see a movie at FatCats  I am writing this because I want FatCats to improve. I want them to be able to provide excellent experiences and treat customers great. There are a lot of children that frequent this location because they do have an arcade and bowling and I am sure when movies like Moana or Zootopia come out they get to make a day of it and the idea that a family or kids could even possibly receive the same treatment that we did after having such a horrible movie experience is upsetting to me.   - Phill Stricklin  P.S.  Now, something that FatCats aren't entirely responsible for are disruptive movie goers. We were stuck next to three members who persisted to talk at regular talking volume throughout the entirety of the movie, when asked to stop they would momentarily but minutes later would continue. One gentleman had his cell phone illuminated practically the entire showtime on his knee, lighting up the entire row behind him and distracting the p"}
{"text":"Fat Cats really does have it all! I'm only reviewing the theatre portion, as we didn't have time to try the other stuff out. We saw Hacksaw Ridge. Movie and staff were both great! We had a wonderful time, the chairs were comfy, and holy cow CHEAP. Last time I went to a theatre with reclining seats it was $25 a person. These tickets were less than $8! Worth the 45 minute drive from Florence, for sure. Will be back."}
{"text":"Purchased an hour of bowling after the kid behind the insisted it was the best deal. Think we paid around 40$ for 1 hour two adult shoes and a child. After buying the round we changed shoes grabbed a pizza and a pitcher of beer. Stated bowling and realized after only 5minutes of bowling we were already down to 30 min. They had started the timer at the time of purchase not once we rolled the first ball. The pizza was small (11\" standard) and not very good considering the pizzeria has a fire burning pizza stove, had to order a panini just to fill up. Upon walking up to the snack par to purchase the panini no one was there so I went to the other counter, there they sent me back to the empty snack stand. I stood there for another good three minutes and had to return to the main counter. Keep in mind the timer for bowling is running down the whole time. Once I returned from ordering the time was just about up. Which was a good thing because, the place was not very full but they say the next group of people (group of 6) right beside us. We had to move out stuff onto one small table because their group was in our lane. I don't know why they did not sit that group on an empty table. We were going to stay for a movie but were afraid we wouldn't be happy with that either. I do congratulate them on hiring teenagers to work there but the lack of experience shows through the train of thought and lack of salesmanship.  I don't think I'll return here."}
{"text":"went last night for the first showing of star wars and i am sold. i love this place they could ad a few more arcade games but its all around fun.great Drinks, the movie theater ROCKS! i will never see a movie anywhere else super comfortable seats great sound system i had a BLAST and will return"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! We are so spoiled now with our reserved seating and recliners we rarely go anywhere else for movie. The have a game area which is reasonably priced and has pretty good games. The have a large selection of food also, so nice to have so many options. We haven't bowled yet but the bowling area looks fun."}
{"text":"A little dirty here.   I wasn't too sure what to expect. I was hoping for a fun place to hang out with my adult friends. This place is full of teenagers and kids.   Helped us feel young again. Movie was good for the price."}
{"text":"I was not familiar with Fat Cat's until locating it online while searching for a movie in a specific timeframe. Dine and Recline sounded good - my wife loves the general trend in theaters today with the reclining seats. Arriving at the theater it looked like a really fun place to hang out, especially if I had brought the kids: bowling, movies, and lots of arcade games. Unfortunately the movie was starting in 20 minutes so we didn't have time to partake in any of those activities. The movie tickets were just under $10, which is fairly standard. The seats were comfortable and it wasn't overly crowded. We enjoyed the movie experience. Dinner and a movie is often a pretty standard, mostly cliché night out.   Combining both into one concept seems like a great idea. After my first experience with such a place, maybe not such an exciting idea. Nice props for the bar area with cocktails and a good selection of reasonably priced craft beers. Unfortunately you cannot bring those into the theater, so with my time crunch there was no time to order one.  The menu was basically like bar food: pizzas, dive bar apps like cheese sticks and nachos, etc. We ordered the margherita pizza, which was is one of my favorites. It was just meh for me. It took about 25 minutes to arrive and one challenging thing I discovered about eating in the movie theater is that it is somewhat difficult to find the sliced pizza in the dark. The cheese sticks were okay, but again just standard. The soda was fine and for checking in on Yelp and buying to two tickets netted me a free popcorn - which was very large.   I would definitely go back and see a movie, and get the standard soda and popcorn. It would also be nice to spend time playing some games. But as for eating? I would probably go elsewhere to eat prior to the movie (or after the movie depending on the time)."}
{"text":"Had a fun time doing the glow golf with the kids. Lots of activities to choose from. Got to try bowling and the food next time. Lanes are $22 and shoes are $3.50."}
{"text":"I really love this place!! We go here often with our pogo passes. Bowling is fun and my kids love the glow golf. We don't do much in the arcade. I think it's a little bit pricey, the reason I gave my rating only 4 stars!! But the theater is one of our favorites--we love the wide recliner's & The ability to order pizza directly to your seats!! My only other complaint is that when it's busy the lines get long and it takes quite a while to be helped! Not fun with small children!!! But if you go on the off-peak hours it's a great place to be!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, we loved it! Very relaxing watching a movie in a recliner and they bring the food to you. Very clean! Great place for date nights or night out with the family."}
{"text":"My wife and I took the kids to this theater and it was well worth it. Every seat in the theater are leather recliners!!! The prices were the same as their competition. we noticed that every Tuesday is all movies are $5. What a deal!!!"}
{"text":"I love the movie theater here, leather seats, reclining, food delivered to you from pizinis, great prices, what's not to like???? I'll be watching movies here instead of Harkins from now on!  Plus they have awesome bowling and cheap Mimi golf that's pretty cool!!!!"}
{"text":"We went there to catch a movie on mother's day. Theatre was so comfortable, and we loved that we could select our seats online! So nice to not have to arrive an hour early to make sure you get a good spot for a new movie! :D"}
{"text":"Can't beat the $5 movie Tuesday. The seats are nice they play current movies. No complaints here."}
{"text":"We went bowling and had a good time.  It was great that it would automatically raise the bumpers for my daughters turn and then retract them after.  Good for adults as they offer plenty of food and beverage options, and also good for kids.  Fun place for family time, we might try a movie next time."}
{"text":"Took the kids here the other day and was pleasantly surprised by the comfortable seating.  close to the house easy to get in and out. Can stay all day if you want they have bowling and games too!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable experience for kids and adults. Wide selection of activities for decent prices. Movies $5 on Tuesday's! Didn't come for the food but would get 5 stars if there were more options."}
{"text":"Went to Fatcats Tuesday morning and had a blast! It's super convenient to have bowling, movies, golf, and dinner all in one place rather than having to drive around town... Also very enjoyable for all ages which is a must for my family, will definitely be going back this weekend to see a movie and eat with the family... Overall 9.9/10"}
{"text":"Nice and clean place.the bathroom was clean and kept up.lots to drink. All kinds of foods. I had a big cookie was great.and on Tuesdays 5 bucks 4 a movie."}
{"text":"This place is cool.  They have a small arcade, bar, mini putt, and bowling. The atmosphere is clean and friendly staff, although they try to tell you about too many deals at one time. It seems like they are trying to get the word out about all their awesome deals by telling you about all of them, when your trying to pay. It's very over whelming..  The Pizini restaurant that is attached, is ok. I ordered pizza, and probably won't order it again. The size was decent but the pizza was soggy. The crust was too thin (it's not a \"thin crust\" pizza) with too much sauce. I will try a salad next time.  The theatre was great! Smelt clean & new! The chairs are still in great condition and even with them open there is still walking room in front of them. It would be nice if they had trays for the food, so you wouldn't have to eat off your lap, but that's just a minor detail.  It's a great place for the whole family and I will return."}
{"text":"Great places for moviegoers the games are good the card readers are to finicky for my tastes"}
{"text":"I've never been to Fat Cats before.  We had 12 exchange students from all over the world and they wanted a place to go and hang out together.  I contacted Laura at Fat Cats and she put together a wonderful package for a fun evening for the students.  Laura was very patient as we tried and figured out what the students wanted to do. Going to Fat Cats was a great experience!  They bowled, played arcades, and played glow golf and thoroughly enjoyed themselves!"}
{"text":"Fat Cats is the place to go for entertainment.  Our family enjoys movies in their pristine theater with reclining leather seats.  The seats are so comfortable.    We love to order there fried zucchini and chicken strips with fries. All of their cook to order food is fresh and delivered to your seat.  They have great deals to save money at this entertainment venue.  Tuesday's are 5.00 movie days.   We also enjoyed bowling on a Monday night with their special family package that includes shoes, drinks and pizzas.    Can't decide still?  Just go there and have fun. You won't be disappointed.  They are located on Greenfield road and Baseline road just South of the US 60 freeway."}
{"text":"We love going to watch movies here! The chairs are so comfy and I love their paninis! They are the bomb! Date night with or with out the kids!"}
{"text":"First time here! Fun place for all ages! Bowling, Games, Laser Tag & much more. Bar area a plus too. Bowled 2 rounds, Ordered wings, littler ones went to play games which you can load on a card, much easier. Lots of fun toys to turn in for special prizes. Look for specials, coupons and Groupon deals. On Tuesday they have $5 movies! Check their website for that offer."}
{"text":"This place was OK. We tried it out yesterday and had a good afternoon, and the food was good. We did the mini golf, which was fun but nothing I'd feel like I had to do again. The bowling looked cool. The video games were the real let down. $1 a game? Every game? That drives me nuts. There weren't many games to choose from and they were all way overpriced.  The manager was a bit overzealous. On several occasions, I was asking a question to an employee, the employee is kindly answering my questions, and in swoops the manager, interrupts the employee, and hijacks our conversation. Have some faith in your employees, man! They're good kids. Your personal intensity is freaking me out.   The food is stupid disorganized. If you're bowling, they find you and bring you your food. If you're not bowling, you have to just periodically check the food window to see if you find something that resembles your order and ask someone to hand it to you. They don't call out names or numbers to tell you your order is ready. And forks are a real commodity around here. They hand you one when you place your order, and you get to carry it around until your food arrives. If you lose it, you will have to find an employee, do several versions of jazz hands to get their attention, explain and repent for losing said fork, then wait while they figure out where the forks are kept.  Now here's my warning to all- BEWARE THE CARPET DIVOT AT THE ENTRANCE. It tripped my son when we first walked in, and then my husband walks up to us later, he looks shaken, and he shows me a rug burn swelling up on his hand. The carpet tripped him and he fell on his face. Nobody said a word! Where's the overzealous manager when one of your customers is on the floor?  I must give props to the 8 year old little blond kid you've got running the place. I hope you treat him well. I saw him cleaning the food area, being an usher at the movie counter, and redeeming game points at the prize counter. He should be overzealous manager's boss.  Total price for family~ 1 kids pizza (hey was i supposed to get a drink with that?) Cuban panini, small fries, 1 med drink, $20 game card & mini golf for 3= $60. I wish this was a little better but it was a decent way to blow off an afternoon. We might go back but I doubt it."}
{"text":"Mediocre selection of games.  Only one guy working the ticket redemption counter on a Friday night?  They're trying to do to much, so they're not good at much.  Try Flipside instead."}
{"text":"Family date night here at this place, movie was great bathrooms were a mess I was in the restroom before the movie with my daughter and there was no toilet paper I told an employee as I walked out that they needed restroom in the second stall and of course my toddler had to go potty again and came back to not only one but two stalls without toilet paper! I get it it's Friday but dang it's your busiest night they should have clean restrooms at least. Another reason why I gave them three stars was the arm of my chair went up and I found this in between the seats! We will be back but hoping the cleanliness will be at little better next time."}
{"text":"Brandon was invited to a birthday party here and we found out that they have a theater with reclining seats and you can order your food and they bring it to you at your seats. It's pizza and panini and other stuff. Food is not that good but it was very comfortable and not very crowded. We saw Mission Impossible. Loved it. We will be back just not that often only because we get discounts at Harkins."}
{"text":"A great place for my teenagers to hang out or even a night out as a family.  From great bowling to a relaxing time watching a movie.  Overall we really enjoy going to Fat Cats."}
{"text":"This place is great. We've been several times and it's always a good experience. I really enjoy the fact that you can pick your own seats for movies."}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it. Came for a movie and we found ourselves comfortably enjoy the movie in the soft and huge reclining sofas. We ordered pizza and mac&cheese and they were delivered to our seats. Amazing! There are vast bowling area and arcade games that can make the visit even more fun. Highly recommend this place. Wish they have more locations so we don't have to go so far from home."}
{"text":"We visited for the first time today and used our pogo pass to play a round of glow golf and bowling. It was a nice little golf course for kids- pirate themed. The bowling alley is nice and modern- they had bumpers that automatically go up for kids and down for adults. Shoe rental was reasonable. We'll Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went with three teens to bowl and watch a movie they had fun. It was a super busy Saturday but the staff was hustling to make sure everyone got taken care of."}
{"text":"This is my kids and I most favorite spot in Gilbert to hang out! We absolutely love to come here! We will not go anywhere else for movies!! We love the mini golf and bowling! This place is convenient to our home and is packed with so much for us to do. As a single mom, I appreciate that the prices are reasonable and I can afford to have some fun with the kiddos with out necessarily breaking the bank. We have never in the many times that we've visited had a negative experience! Absolutely it here!"}
{"text":"The same quality of movie you'll get at the other bigger well known theater chains like AMC or Harkins.  Their recliners are far better though and more comfortable. It's also nice to be able to reserve seating in advance so you don't have to stand in lines or worry about getting there 45 minutes or more in advance to get a good seat. An added feature is you can order food and they'll bring it to you. The only downside is their recliners don't have any type of small table that flips up to rest your food on. It makes it a little awkward for eating a pizza or something other than popcorn and a drink."}
{"text":"Was a great place to have my sons 6th birthday as he gets older ill will come back and do the bowling the little birthday room was great wish time was longer but either way great place our party host was so helpful and nice"}
{"text":"my family loves it here and have been several times! my child had a bday party here a couple times, as well and both were great! they were a lot of fun for the kiddos, who also loved having their own space for bowling & hanging out, and very easy for the parents. The hostesses and coordinator were great, friendly and made the parties a smooth success; I recommend having a party here, its well worth it!  The movies comfy chairs, popcorn, drink dispenser, pizza and delivery to your movie seat are great. they are reasonably priced and decent quality.  the golfing is fine, although the course could be a little longer for play.  the place is clean and i feel good about bringing my kiddos here, overall.  if i could change anything, i'd say have some measures for assigned theater seats to ensure people take the seats they chose. you can't count on all people using common courtesy or respect no matter where you go, and we've had that issue a couple times. its bound to happen, but some people don't handle these situations well. overall though, we've had some great family experiences here and we recommend it."}
{"text":"We thought we had great seats since they were dead center but the blasted railings are installed so high that they obstruct the view of the screen. Also, no ushers come in during the show so you're often stuck with some little terror that's hopped up on slushies running around and ruining the movie for everyone except his own parents, who are invariably completely blind and deaf when it comes to their own offspring. I've had my last trip to this daycare center/ theatre."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this place out since we usually bowl at AMF. It's a fun place for kids but if you're interested in bowling bowling I don't think this place is for ya. There's no ceiling fans as you know when you start bowling it gets pretty hot! It was hard to read/understand the score board, you couldn't tell who was suppose to bowl next. They did a lot of games on the side to get free t-shirts or game cards. They do have cosmic bowling which was fun however their music kept cutting out. It's all couch seating so that's pretty nice, but the tables they had were too high and big for the area.  The arcade area is small with mainly ticket machines. The bar area was pretty plain. Wasn't much of a drink selection. We decided to try some snacks, they recommended the jalapeño poppers and fried zucchini. The jalapeño poppers were good but missing the bronco berry sauce from Arby's that would of made it lol. The fried zucchini had too much breading.  Overall we will try this place again but I think we will stick with AMFs for our regular bowling."}
{"text":"Great for movies! The ticket prices were much more reasonable than comparable recliner theaters for Harkins or AMC. And the recliners were super comfy and the theater was very clean.  I did not try the food from Pizini but the kiddos liked the pizza quite a bit."}
{"text":"Located in a great part of Gilbert, Fat Cats is a fun place to spend time with your friends and/or family. Movie theatre, arcade, bowling alley and restaurant make this a fun place for everyone. Food is pretty tasty and they have a bar with a large selection of drinks. Arcade games are fun and there's a ticket redemption counter with cool prizes. Service was great as the staff is efficient, accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"The bowling here is pretty awesome, especially when they have the late night music and lights.  One star away for the Lakers basketball machine (I'm a Suns fan BTW).  Joking, but all jokes aside the arcade is modest at best, definitely not on par with Dave and Busters or Main Event.  Overall, the wife and I had fun and would come back for late bowling and the movie experience, which looks fun."}
{"text":"I think its bull shit I payed for 6 movie tickets and $150 in food and cant get a water cup with a lid or a larger water cup for that matter. All the staff are rude pissed off teenagers that can't do simple task. I have come here over 10 times and its about time I did this damn review. At first I thought since it was a new business they probably still needed time to get in the groove of things but from the looks of it this will just always be this kind of business. Anytime I come here to bowl or see a movie its another grumpy employee that cant even greet you or check if you need anything and if you do need something have fun trying to hunt them down.. oh and when you do finally get ahold of who ever is \"helping\" you they will be making out or talking to another staff member with their phone out."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with family and a few weekends ago and played the mini golf and arcade games. The art on the walls for mini golf is amazing and the games/prices were decent. We did not try the food or the movie theater with the big seats but plan to some time in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Reasonable prices for movies and concessions.  Games are fun and don't cost an arm and leg to play.  This is a great family fun center."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back to @FatCatsGilbert! Less overwhelming than some other indoor attractions which I love! There's cosmic bowling, glow golf, arcade games and even a movie theater... extra bonuses, there's a full service bar to quench everyone's thirst. I could be here all day, but next time I come, I'll go for HH for their drink specials ($2 well drinks) OR I'll bring the fam/friends and give the Family Special a try!"}
{"text":"Okay, so this place has totally spoiled me!  If a movie I want to see isn't here, I won't go.  Most comfortable viewing experience on the planet.  Great, great, great sliders delivered right to your seat.  Arcade area needs some work, way too many machines/games out of order a lot of the time.  Bowling is a bit expensive.  The Glow Golf, however is super reasonable and is a great time filler if you arrive early for a movie.  Oh, and - the very best feature . . . choose your seats in advance!!!  No more rushing to get there so you don't have neck breaking front row seats.  Staff has always been very friendly and seem to like their jobs.  (Unlike the robotic type employees at nameless other theaters) I even downloaded their app on my phone because we have been seeing more movies lately than ever!"}
{"text":"Awesome environment. So much fun. So many different activities. Between bowling, mini golf, movies and the arcade. My kids love it. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Our family absolutely loves this place. It has completely changed our movie going experience. Bowling, games and a movie. Gotta love it."}
{"text":"I came to arizona from Iowa to visit an old friend and ended up coming here for bowling. Great environment! high energy! Fun people! One of the managers, Ricky Madrid, was very helpful and kind with handling a big group. He had a strong presence of authority.   Also, I went in to pizini to eat a pizza. Calming surroundings right when I walked in. The cashier, Judah Watson, was very spirited and welcoming. I like a fast and efficient worker and that is exactly what she was. My vacation in Arizona was one to remember."}
{"text":"Loved our first visit to Fat Cats!  The theater was great.  Loved the cozy recliners.  Food was ok, they do deliver it right to your seat.  I felt the prices on concessions were very reasonable.  We did bowling too, also very reasonable & a great time.  I enjoyed the neon,large screens, music, & couches.  They do have a bar, but you can not take drinks into the theater.  Will definitely be back, especially for $5 Tuesday movies."}
{"text":"Has replaced AMC and Harkins for me, for life. That sentence enough should make anyone come here and make the change as well."}
{"text":"I honestly had a good time at this place which is something I found surprising because this is not a place I would go. I came with a friend and we bowled 8 games until midnight and it was righteous. I don't care for top 40 but it works for this place. The bowling lanes were like being at a rave mixed with laser tag; what an experience. They have theaters and an arcade, too."}
{"text":"Lots to do!  From bowling to mini golf to movies, this is a great place to escape the heat. Kind of spendy, so bring the money.  But it is a nice treat for the kids once and a while!"}
{"text":"Here is the story; We took our son and his family to the movie Point Break. Movie and seating was great. We ordered pizza and it sucked. It was cold, chewy and soggy. When the movie was over my wife went over and told the counter person about our experience with the food and that we were very unhappy about the food. As we were leaving and standing outside the doors the \"On duty manager\" Jared, tracked us down outside and listened to our complaint. He apologized repeatedly and went back in and not only refunded our money spent on the food but gave us a gift card for the amount we spent on the movie. The company that owns this business needs to know that their manager Jared truely knows the meaning of \"customer service\" and went out of his way to find us and completely make our evening unforgetable. We will be back."}
{"text":"This review is for the food we received.... My oldest daughter(16) and I went to see in the theater today Minions. We ordered two chicken paninis and had them delivered to us before our movie started. Both paninis were incredibly hard, I'm talking break a tooth hard.  My daughters had little to no chicken on hers. We also weren't given forks to eat the pasta that comes as a side dish. The food was cold like it had been sitting awhile before being delivered to us. I'm very disappointed with today's visit."}
{"text":"Great place to take the family with all the things to do right in one spot, I specially like the movies where you can reserve your seats on-line."}
{"text":"We have had two parties at Fat Cats and it really was amazing to have a party hostess, have a room decorated and not have to worry about anything except enjoying the party. Was so much fun! Our little party hostess was a blast as well! This is our go to spot and to also host memorable parties that are so fun and affordable is a big bonus for us. We love Fat Cats and will continue to be loyal customers! (Ps- both times Laura has made sure our parties went well) love her too!"}
{"text":"Such a fun family place to go and enjoy with little and still enjoy some adult goodness as well!! Very affordable and a definet to do go to!!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend coming here to see a movie and eat during your movie! This place is nice and looks fun but it's not set up to actually dine at your recliner in the theater. You also have to wait in long lines to order your food so they can later bring it to you at your seat. Which if you didn't plan for will force you to miss part of your movie as we did. We weren't expecting to spend an extra 15 minutes trying to order food. Then if you don't know yet, you cannot have alcohol in the theater. There's refills on your soda but then you'll be waiting behind a flurry of kids doing the same thing. If I do come back here at least I'll know what to expect. But I won't be eating here out of styrofoam containers at my seat."}
{"text":"Great place to have a party. My hostess was fantastic, prompt and friendly and the kids had an amazing time. Bowling was a little backed up, but nothing I can complain about. The kids didn't want to leave, so that says it all."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Fat Cats in Gilbert and it won't be our last.  We bowled on this visit and the lanes were clean and kept up to date with fun scoreboards that showed cute clips after each roll.  The glow in the dark vibe made it feel like a moonlight bowl even though it was in the middle of the day.  This place has a cinema with the latest releases, a miniature golf course, arcade, bowling alley, ?and pizzeria.  There is basically something for everyone.  I highly recommend? this place? for entertaining the family!"}
{"text":"Came here with the lover for the first time after finding it on Yelp. I think this place is great due to the fact that they have a movie theater, bowling, and arcade. So it's very family friendly. There's also a bar for you to grab a drink before the movie. Only bummer is you can't bring it into the movie with you like you can at Esplanade.   I thought that the seats were too close together, there wasn't a lot of room. Also, they don't recline very far back as well. I don't think the little separator goes up either between each seat. Comparing this place to Regal Cinemas, I prefer Regal Cinemas over this one. I do think it's a great place to take the kids though. Plus you get a free popcorn when you check in!"}
{"text":"For some reason, they are refusing to accept my debit card to purchase movie tickets because it says \"movie pass\" on it. The manager is convinced that they are being cheated out of money for some reason? They refused to do anything about it and just told me they would not accept it. Terrible service. They lost multiple costumers from this experience. Me and all me extended family that were planning on going to the movies together."}
{"text":"Great place to have a kids birthday party. Our experience was terrific! The kids had a blast and our host was incredible. She took care of everything. I would recommend this venue"}
{"text":"This place is comfortable, reasonably priced, and one of our new favorite date spots. We played in the arcade and went to the movies a few times, and went to their bar area. Only the bar area is lacking, and you can't take hard drinks into the movie, but other than that this place is stellar. Those seats are incredibly comfortable."}
{"text":"We love this place! We usually catch a drink and place an order for pizza before our movie, Hazy is the best bartender in all the land! Try this place, it's the best!"}
{"text":"We initially purchased tickets to see Black Panther at the Queen Creek Harkins at 8:30PM but my husband wanted to ensure we had good seats so we cancelled our ticket order and decided to go to Fat Cats instead. If you buy your tickets in advance via Fandango you can pick your seats which is great. We ended up going to the 10:20PM show and ordering some food, we had a pepperoni pizza delivered to us in the theater (it's a small, shareable pizza) and we also ordered nachos, drinks, and I got a small scoop of ice cream. I actually meant to order loaded nachos but didn't say loaded so I was just given the standard which was my error but I was actually glad in the end that I didn't get them. Their nacho cheese is trash, it had the weirdest aftertaste, I ended up just tossing them out. Everything else was good though and I used my Yelp check-in to get a free large popcorn. Other than the nacho cheese my only complaint is that it was SO HOT in the theater. It was in the 70's outside but much, much, MUCH warmer inside. I was sweating like a sinner in church! I had to eat the ice out of my drink in order to cool down. I didn't want to get up during the movie to complain but if it's going to be that warm inside the theater, I'll definitely stick with Harkins going forward."}
{"text":"Ya so we reserved a bowling lane and they gave it to someone else and made us wait in a 30 minute line."}
{"text":"Came here for my god daughter while I was visiting them during the holidays. They have a bar for the adults, a few bowling lanes, movies, small food cafe serving finger foods only and a small selection of games to play from for the kids.   Price of drinks at the bar are average $10-15. Bowling was a bit on the pricer side for shoes and the lane, but that is only cause they do it a lil different here. They charge you by the hour, not by the number of games you want to play. If you think about it that is expensive coming with kids, we were barley able to even finish 1 game for that hour. We ordered some food before we played too. We got the chicken tenders w/fries, medium pizza, wings, and mozzarella sticks. It was all okay, since you can't mess up putting things in the fryer lol.   My god daughter loves this place and we will be back for that reason! And because we can play games together and their finger foods ain't that bad. Would hope that they get some more arcade games tho so we get more of a variety to chose from and play since all the kids are there playing games."}
{"text":"I love fat cats it's a little joint mainly for the neighborhood family and kids and even a little date night with your love her or friends we came here on a double date with my friends being that we're in our twenties oh this is a good place to bring our little nieces and nephews but let's go golf watch a movie all in one which is awesome we decided to eat first and let me tell you the appetizers are amazing I love how crispy their chicken tenders are I love that the drinks are refillable I love the seats in the movie theater I even love the mini glow golf and it's a short golfing course and it's fun of course with them right amount of people and who you bring we didn't get the ball because it was packed being that weekends are always packed and you're my boyfriend tend to go watch movies when its died down maybe on the weekdays or even Tuesdays if we can catch the late movie for $5 I thought that there should be more specials I will refer anybody or let anybody know to come here or even bring them with me thank you I love fat"}
{"text":"The back of the employees shirts say \"We create experiences that bring you back\".  Well, I can certainly say they did just that for my family.  We came for miniature golf and my son wanted to keep his golf ball.  I asked if they were for sale and they said unfortunately, no. My little boy was sad but we totally understood.  Shortly later a staff member approached my little boy saying that she knows he is sad and asked if a really cool slinky would make him feel better.  His eyes lit up and the smile on his face was priceless.  That was phenomenal customer service in my book.  I will absolutely suggest this establishment and plan to revisit in the future."}
{"text":"The movie was excellent.  The whole experience was great. Love the seating. The facility is very clean."}
{"text":"So I have decided to significantly drop the star rating for this place because of my last visit. I recently went to watch a movie and figured it was like AMC theater where you can buy a over priced beer and bring it into the theater. I confirmed with the ticket guy and was told it had to be in a paper cup in order for me to bring it in because no plastic was available. So I went to the bartender and ordered 2 big coors lights and went to the snackbar while they were being poured to get 2 cups. They made me pay 8 bucks for the paper cups, but figured this is what they do to make the most money.... I went back to the bar and gave the bartender by debit card while I poured a beer into my cup, he stopped and started yelling at me \"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING\"! I felt like a little kid in trouble, I asked him what he was talking about.... He  continued to yell at me as he swiped the beers away saying \"I TOLD YOU NO BEER IN THE THEATER\" and kept repeating himself... I Told him I don't know what the **BLEEP** he was talking about since I never asked him about the theater, I just asked him to pour me 2 coors lights. This old bartender continued to get on me to the point where he got degrading. I wasn't aware as a 34 yr old I had to ask for permission from every single person to have a beer and enjoy my movie. I will never watch another movie there, and honestly debate going back.... I don't get it, they have Arcade, bowling alley, mini golf, movies.... and a bar...... I didn't bring my beer in.. You offer it to me for a high cost, I pay you for it, and I drink it.... I am blown away to think they have restriction on where and where you cannot drink it."}
{"text":"My friends, son and I all love this place!!!!!  I am so glad they are open!  Its a Sunday mommy son date day.  The best part is that if there is an issue they do not give you any hassle they make sure to make it right! :)"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed  when I check my bank account and saw there was extra money charge to my account. When I spoke to the manager he said there was nothing he can do about it because I didn't have my card number (I got a new card Wednesday I was using a temp card during that transaction.) which is there is a signed copy of receipt but you can't do anything about it that a tip was added that I didn't write in. I will NEVER go back to this company this makes me sick to my stomach... Learn customer service skills and now I have to go to the trouble of reporting fraud because of this."}
{"text":"Such a fun place, but I seriously leave every movie with my clothes stuck to me because it's SO HOT in the theaters!!!!"}
{"text":"Ralph is the Shit! I havent had this good of customer service ever. Talk about a well trained polite worker! My group and i will definitely be back just to see ralph! Fat cats has my buisness now!"}
