{"text":"Cooking here is solid. Menu is actually a mix of Cambodian and Vietnamese food with some Thai dishes thrown in. From what I understand, the family that runs the restaurant is Cambodian who lived in Vietnam. Hence, the staff are able to speak Vietnamese.   The rau muong xào toi (a type of spinach sauteed with garlic) was excellent while the dau hu rang mui tiêu (salt & pepper tofu) took fresh tofu and deep fried the sucker rather than using already fried tofu. That's the first time I've had it that way instead of the usual refried tofu that most restaurants seemed to serve. I enjoyed both dishes while my relatives enjoyed their freshly fried fish. They said it was a  doré, which is some type of pike.  Service is somewhat lacking but prompt once called. The usual service that you can expect out of a busy Asian restaurant that mostly caters to Asian clientele."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a Gem!! Located in St-Michel in a strip mall. Prices are very reasonable and there's a lot of variety to chose from! Parking is a little bit hard but you can always find some in the little streets! Bring your own wine/beer so it's pretty much convenient. The food is delicious and it never dissapoints! If you are planning to go to dinner, don't forget to make reservation after 7PM or go before the big rush! Service is a hit and miss!"}
{"text":"Bro listen up, the food was mad decent. You have to get up for the bill but coug when you fine dine like this you need a bit of exercise. There is a great mix of spices in the dishes and a lot of choices on the menu. I defz recommend this restaurant to anyone who is on the look out for good Oriental food."}
{"text":"Food is good enough but amazing..no. It's fast it's cheap and it's tasty enough. Value for the money? Definitely"}
{"text":"Located near metro St-Michel, which is good in term of access. Last time I went there, i ordered their Red rice with beef. Portions are very generous. Taste-wise, it was very decent for the price paid (less than 10$). Service was lacking, as in any asian restaurant. Good location for lunch or dinner. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Alors heum.  Oui, mais non, mais oui quand même.  J'y vais pour souper avec des amis. Ils y vont souvent, mais cette fois, tout le monde est un peu déçu. Beaucoup d'attente, on nous amène les plats à plusieurs minutes d'intervalles, le service est très peu courtois, il est difficile d'obtenir un sourire. Qu'est-ce qui se passe?  Certains aliments sont tièdes.   À la fin du repas, nous avons encore de la place dans l'estomac. On décide alors de commander un plat supplémentaire en spécifiant qu'on veut bien le plat entier et non la version \"entrée\". Est-ce qu'on a l'air d'avoir trop mangé déjà? Aucune idée, mais en plus de se faire regarder comme si nous venions d'une autre planète, nous recevons l'entrée. À ce moment, ça suffit, on se dirige vers la sortie.   Dommage. J'y retournerai, pour laisser une deuxième chance aux assiettes tièdes et pour recommander mes coups de coeur. Cela dit, j'aime me sentir en minorité culturelle. Kim Hour, ça semble être tout un monde, un endroit où les familles se réunissent. On peut apporter notre alcool (bon à savoir pour la prochaine fois, parce que si c'est aussi triste, je boirai pour oublier). Heureusement, j'étais en bonne compagnie et cette assiette de champignons en valait la peine à elle seule!"}
{"text":"Menu is mostly Cambodian style dishes with a few Thai flavored items. Lots of good items to choose from. Don't think they compare with anything else in the area. They don't have a full liquor licence, but you can bring your own wine.   Nothing impressive with the dinning area, noisy and crowded during weekends. Located in a small strip mall, on a busy boulevard. Parking up front is limited and always a challenge during busy hours. Note on the location... They use to be somehow hidden around the Kim Hour market, but now they moved a few doors down where \"Chez l'père Gédéon\" use to be.    Overall a great experience, will come back for more."}
{"text":"This was one of those Yelp wins that makes me so delighted to be adventuring armed with an app amplified by such an amazing community. We were at the St Michel Market, which at a certain point becomes overwhelming, and we headed out into the rain with our wares when hunger hit and seconds before tripping weakly towards the metro I pulled out my trusty Yelp App, hit that Nearby tab and TADAM. Deliciousness right across the street apparently.   We opened the door and grinned at each other. A big comfortable room, full but with seats for us, and packed with families almost entirely Asian eating grilled lobster, whole roast fishes, glorious noodle mountains. Friendly happy service greeted and seated us and handed over big fat menus written in at least 4 languages in some parts, with Vietnamese, Cambodian, Thai and Chinese classics. We were only too people so we could only try so much, and neither of us are experts but the spicy Cambodian beef was just perfect in texture, and uniquely spicy and sweet and awesome. The Kim Hour noodles were just right too, not too greasy, but just greasy enough, and the veggies we ordered were tasty and tart too.   Inexpensive, and an excellent compliment to any St Michel adventure. Thanks wholeheartedly fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Went there after a gym session, my friend and I were starving and craving for some asian food so we went there since it is not far. Waiters were nice, they hurried us a bit to order, but that is kinda expected coming from an asian restaurant.  We had rice noodles with an egg, salt and pepper shrimp, chinese broccoli. and a kinda salad, dont know what the name is in english. They were all pretty good, especially the salad, which was really spicy (love it tho). The shrimps were served with the skin on, just the way I like it, and the noodles were quite nice. Overall, it was a very satisfying experience, will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good restaurant that offers cheap meals like pho, fried rice, and above all loc lac (beef cube), my favorite meal!  We were a party of three and we had lobsters (you can choose how they prepare it), loc lac, a pho and a Cambodian beef.  The loc lac was good, although I was surprised to see broccoli with it. The Cambodian beef was so so, I don't recommend it.  The service is not amazing, you need to pay at the counter, waiters are not really nice. But they're efficient so nevermind.  Overall, it's a good option if you want to eat cheap but tasty Asian food. Out of the lobsters, everything was good for a budget meal."}
{"text":"Très décevant, la soupe est fade et non traditionnelle, semble être faite vite avec les ingrédients de faibles qualités. Les nouilles sautés sont épouvantables, les garnitures sens le métal des conserves trop vieux."}
{"text":"I usually really like this place. This time though i am taking away two stars because the service was more then mediocre. They were extremely rude but as soon as they heard our order their attitudes changed. A table of 14 with a 500$ bill. It was mainly seafoods. We waited 45 minutes before getting our soups. The waitress forgot to give us plates, chopsticks and tea. It really is too bad because the food isn't all that bad here. I am a big sucker for good service. I grew up within the restaurant business and work in the restaurant business. Service is sooooo important. So two stars because the service was shi*!!!"}
{"text":"La plupart des assiettes sont tres bonnes. Resto chinois mixé avec cuisine vietnamienne et cambodgienne d'assez bonne qualité. Bcp de tables. Le menu resemble à un catalogue avec leur nombreux choix. Parcontre le service est lent et impersonelle mais ne le prenez pas personnel ce n'est que culturel..  Thé inclus et oranges coupés offert pour le souper."}
{"text":"Bon bon bon... comment commencer!? Je suis une habituée ici, je viens au moins 1 fois par mois. La nourriture est très bien, mais surtout pas cher! On amène les amis, la famille et on partage le plus de plats possible! Habituellement, je n'ai rien à dire, le service est rapide, peu courtois, la bouffe est bouillante. Pas cette fois-ci par contre!  Le service est exécrable, on reçoit un plat à la fois, d'abord les légumes, qui sont plutôt tièdes, ensuite les nouilles, presque froides... Et ça continu comme ça pour le reste du repas. Très décevant, en plus les assiettes sont presque vides. Ce doit être la 20e fois que je viens ici et c'est la première fois que je sors du resto déçue et non rassasiée. Étant acharnée, je reviendrai pour voir si le service et la qualité s'améliore, sans quoi ce ne sera plus un de mes rituels du week-end."}
