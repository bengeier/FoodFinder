{"text":"I eat here many times. I am that single guy people look at and feel sorry for cause I am reading something and ignoring them, unless she is hot ;)
You cannot go wrong with any of the food here. Really.
Now that its winter, its PHO and more PHO.
As custom men will serve you and the women will take your money, haha.
Check it out."}
{"text":"The best Pho in the valley. My fav dishes: lemongrass chicken and their beef pho.

Run by a family. Very friendly people. 

Swift service. 

The place is sorta like a street food place, very 'informal'. But is nice.

Not pricey for what the food tastes like.

For spice lovers, dont go easy on the chilli paste they serve on the table."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I had the egg noodle soup with Shrimp and Crab. It was delicious and I ordered a side of cold bean sprouts which I thought was interesting since all the Vietnamese restaurants I have been to have just brought it with the soup. I have been to a ton of Pho restaurants in Utah, Los Angeles and Phoenix and this one is a very good one indeed! I will come again for sure!"}
{"text":"Even if the pho weren't the best in town (it IS), I would love this place just for the staff. These guys are friendly and excellent. I feel welcomed and comfortable every time I go. They remember our orders and treat us like friends. Pho tai and spring rolls, with the excellent dipping sauce are the perfect weekend meal!"}
{"text":"So glad I decided to stopy by Khai Hoan last week.  I recently moved back to AZ from L.A. and was on the prowl for a Vietnamese restaurant.  

Service was quick and our food arrived within 15 minutes of our entering their establishment.  My daughter and I ordered the same item (pho with beef meatballs / $5.25 each) and Thai iced tea ($2.50 each).  

The pho broth was so flavorful and fragrant!  I normally cannot finish a bowl of pho, but this time around, I piled on the veggies and inhaled the pho within 5 minutes LOL

The place is open 6 days a week, from 9am-9pm (closed Sundays).  The menu has a mix of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes, with prices ranging from $6.25 to $7.85 for their entrees.  

I look forward to returning soon to try their goi cuon (spring rolls / $3.25), cha gio (fried egg rolls / $6.25), and the com tam dac biet (pork chop, beef, shredded pork, and steamed egg meatloaf over rice / $7.50).  

I'm spoiled with the diversity and quality of restaurants in L.A., so I'm hunting around the PHX metro area to find quality Asian restaurants.  

Anyone know of any Malaysian restaurants in the PHX metro area?"}
{"text":"Really good pho, but I have not had very much pho in my short life, so I don't have much to compare it to. 

The spring rolls to start were really good and the peanut sauce was super yummy! 

I got the vegetable pho with egg noodles. The broth was a little bit bland with a little hoisin sauce it was good. There were a lot of different vegetables in the soup and they were all super fresh and good quality! 

The portion size was smaller than the average pho but considering the fact pho comes in huge portions it is not a problem. 

The guy who serves you and welcomes you (I think he is the owner...) is super friendly and service is quick."}
{"text":"I give this 4 because it is better than its Pho restaurant peers in all of  Phoenix that I've been to. None of them stacks up to this place in terms of overall satisfaction(what usually lets the other places down is the lack of indoor decor and apparent uncleaniness). I usually order large Pho with everything and they usually get the broth flavor balanced and the meat sliced right in moderate sizes and in the right quality typical of good pho. There were readied condiment and fresh and clean vegetables to rebalance the flavor.  I also go for the \"com thumb\" which is  a good dry dish alternative when I'm not in the mood for soup.

The price is right on target for these items. I wouldn't want to say but they can probably get away with charging $.50 to $1 more per item (without pushing me to cook my own Pho) and people like me will still come because there are no other Vietnamese restaurant this overall good in Phoenix.

The outside doesn't look as good as the inside. The inside is well decor for a Pho place and clean. The service is average for Pho restaurant which means it's minimal.


The food reminds me of the many good Pho places in Westminster CA that I've eaten at. That is why I would take my folks here and drive further. We came around 930 am and lunch and we didn't have to wait long. They were fast in delivering the food even during lunch when it was packed."}
{"text":"Yes! Best Pho in Phoenix, taking into account price and convenience. The portions are huge, as is to be expected with a XL bowl of pho. The broth is superb. No salt water here, like some other cut rate places. I don't know what else I can say that other's haven't already. This place doesn't have a high rating for nothing. The build-your-own spring rolls are good too.

It's small and homey. Exactly what you would expect for a family owned restaurant. It's like having a meal in someone's home. You can taste the love that has gone into the meal and that's what counts."}
{"text":"Some of the best pho I have ever had... Most flavorful broth.  Most tender meat.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Is it possible to get tasty Vietnamese at a place where you don't have to turn a blind eye to the unwanted glimpses of the kitchen?  Yes, indeed.

While not a stunning polished restaurant by any stretch of the imagination, Khai Hoan is an impeccably clean little family place cooking simple good food in a strip mall on Apache Blvd.   The selections are tasty, plentiful and cheap with apps ranging from $3-$6 and Mains running from $6-$7.  

I enjoyed the usual Vietnamese favorites of spring rolls and pho.  While the grilled pork on broken rice was nicely flavored, the meat was a touch on the dry side.  

My favorite is the pickled papaya with charcoal grilled pork and meatball.  It's served with rice noodles, lettuce and fresh herbs.  The charred savory meat is nicely balanced by the sweet and sour papaya.  The rice noodles are great for absorbing the tasty broth.

But don't go here on a lazy Sunday...you'll be sorely disappointed since the place will be closed.

Don't forget to pick up some baklava from Haji-Baba (in the same center) for dessert."}
{"text":"Amazing Pho! Some of the best in AZ. The shrimp spring rolls are also delicious! Love this place. I come here probably about 5-6 times a month and would go more often if it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"When I moved back here after college, I knew that I needed to find a ph restaurant as soon as possible.  And this small, unassuming joint in a little strip mall on Apache has come through in a big way, time and time again. Really, it's as consistent as you can get: delicious food, attentive staff, and chock full of people eating there at all conceivable hours of the day--a sure sign of its quality, affordability, and character.

If you like Vietnamese food, come here. If you are new to Vietnamese food, come here. If you don't like Vietnamese food, then either don't come here or change your mind about it, and come here. Because this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Would you like some cockroach with your soup? Yes a live cockroach crawled out from under the napkin holder while I was eating.

The service was really poor. 

The food was ok.. not awful but not great. I got the vegetable soup. Its the worst I have had here on the east side.

For its location I would say look somewhere else. Tempe is filled with other great places to eat.

Bring some raid!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Everything I have had here is amazing.  The pho is just ok and I would recommend other places for better pho, but the spring rolls here are the best I have ever had - moist, mint, noodle, perfectly cooked pork and shrimp that hasn't been overlooked, amazing peanut sauce, and just tasty!  All the beef and shrimp dishes h are cooked to perfection.  And tea is $1.50 for a pot!   I love it."}
{"text":"worst fried rice I've ever had! I think they just gave me brown rice. it was so bland! I will give some other menu items a try again before I completely mark this place from my list! also, the bathroom is in the kitchen? kind of crazy and doesn't seem that sanitary to me haha"}
{"text":"I think this pho place has been the most consistent one in the entire Phoenix metropolitan area in my opinion. I've been going to this one for at least 8 years now and hasn't disappointed me. They don't mess around. Decor is the usual dumpy looking asian restaurant, where you need to walk into the kitchen to get to the toilets. However, the Pho is fantastic here. Price is very reasonable, you can get a large bowl of Pho Bo Dac Biet for under $7. Very generous on the meat, tendon and veggie. The beef is very tender, the broth is very flavorful (not too salty, not too bland, not MSG tasting) and the right amount of fresh veggies (basil, bean sprouts, lime, mint).Their spring rolls are also very well done, and the peanut sauce is to die for!


The service is very fast and polite servers. 

This place is very popular among the college crowd due to the close proximity to Arizona State University. Definitely should give it a shot if you have never been to this Pho place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I would not come back to this restaurant.  The broth for Pho was not very tasty (did not have a lot of beef flavor).  Price is expensive ($8 for a bowl of noodle soup and the portion size is small.)  Pho Thanh only charge $5 for the same type of noodle soup.  The broth taste better and you get a lot more noodles.  However, beef ball was good.

My guest had the bun bo hue.  It did not have pork sausage (cha lua) but instead has joint/tendons/beef meat.  She asked for just beef ball.  The broth was spicy but lack depth.  It did not taste a little sour and spicy as it should, it has strong fish sauce flavor.  Everything considered, the price is expensive for the quality/quantity.  The restaurant was nice and clean however.

I decided to try this restaurant due to many positive reviews, however, after eating there I wondered where other people taste are like due to their positive ratings.  I'm Vietnamese/Chinese have eaten VN/Chinese cuisine all over the map.
This is my honest opinion."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in the valley. Not fancy but the real deal. Cheap too!"}
{"text":"For whatever reason, it seems to be exceptionally difficult to find good Asian food in the Valley.  Fortunately, although after a lot of scouring on Yelp, I came across Khai Hoan.  This restaurant is very unassuming but it is really, really, really good.   

I took other Yelp contributors' advice and had the Pho.  The Pho came out quickly, it was hot, had great flavor, and was pretty inexpensive.  Even though I've had Pho at other Vietnamese restaurants, this meal was truly great.  I am glad I succumbed to the Pho fascination that is infiltrating America because this iteration was some of the best Vietnamese food that I have ever had.   I have been fortunate enough to try great Vietnamese food in both Chicago's \"Little Vietnam\" and New York's Chinatown and it's not a stretch to say that Khai Hoan certainly equals the quality of the food that I had in both of those places.  

Even though this restaurant has waiter service you must still go to the cashier at the end of the meal to get your bill.  That's hardly a reason to fault the restaurant especially since their food is so good and their prices are so reasonable."}
{"text":"I come here almost every time I visit my kids at ASU. Never disappoints. Owners are super sweet. Best pho in town."}
{"text":"Pho is great although it hasn't been consistent lately.  My husband ordered some spicy chicken wings and that was tasty. The service is ok. This place is our top pick for pho."}
{"text":"This place has amazing Pho. Not to mention the best crab puffs in town!  Service is always super fast and they remember their regulars. ;) great for take out too. Try the iced coffee it's delicious! The Thai tea is tasty too."}
{"text":"I have been going to Khai Hoan with my family for several years now and we absolutely love it! Whenever we have friends or family in town one of the first places is Khai Hoan because the food is just so fantastic! The owner is super friendly as are the rest of the staff. I have never had a bad experience there, and the food is always delicious. I usually go at least once every two weeks, otherwise I get withdrawals! By far one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona and definitely worth checking out. So what are you waiting for? Go eat there!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. The meat is really good quality.  But the biggest thing that stood out was a server. A young guy with a blue hat. He gave the best customer service!! He was extremely patient and kind. We took my grandma along and she needed to go to the bathroom so she had to wait at the table. He checked to let my grandma know that the restroom was available. I know it may sound silly to leave a review about something like this but it's not always about the food but sometimes the experience."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho!  Don't have Bahn Mi though :(."}
{"text":"Remember eating here a couple years ago and the pho was really bland. Even though it's the closest pho place to my house, I'd rather make the trip to Pho 68 or De Vangs."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place won Best of Phoenix for 2014 because there was nothing good about it. 

The water we were served had old brown limes in it and our dinners failed to please. If you need to use the restroom you will literally have to walk through the cluttered kitchen with trays of exposed meat to a dirty bathroom. While we were waiting for our dinner my boyfriend killed a roach on the wall next to our table. My vegetarian pho had three pieces of fried tofu that tasted like they had been fried in week old oil. I also shortly after had a horrible stomach ache that lasted several hours. My boyfriend had grilled pork chop over rice that was too salty and the rice was mushy. We will not be returning to this location ever."}
{"text":"I love pho, ramen, basically any kind of noodle soup.  

I have had my fair share of pho and I can honestly say that this is some of the best pho I've ever had!

This is my go to place for a down home, no frills, cheap meal.

Stick with the pho soups here, but some of the vietnamese rice dishes are scrumptious too.  

Get #37 (Pork Chop Rice), it comes with pickled vegetables, shredded pork, something like a sausage patty, an egg cake, a pork chop and a side of fish sauce.  Here's a tip ask for a fried egg also which just goes great with the pork and rice. 
-(so delicious) 

I have been known to eat two meals a day here.

Also, the staff is very friendly and it's family owned, so an extra + in my book."}
{"text":"It's saddening when one finds better Vietnamese food in Phoenix instead of San Jose...

Any place that can make a good banh xeo (and be generous with it too), gets a huge thumbs up from me already. Along with so many other dishes like banh cuon and com tam bi, there's a lot to try out. I also finally tried some of the pho today and it's definitely better than what I've had in other restaurants (family kitchen's another story). All too often, I find the broth to be too light and flavorless, but at least today's pho was dark and had flavor, if still somewhat weak. It was also fast too, pretty much within 5 minutes of ordering. Maybe I'll suffer the inconsistent broth other reviewers stated.

Finally, to all the reviewers about the bathroom: get over it. I've seen a LOT worse, and while one may have to cross the kitchen to get there, blame the building owner and developer who designed the damn layout of the place. Heck, I'm sure there are city codes being broken there, so I'm sure the city would love to know."}
{"text":"Had Vietnamese food for the first time today at Khai Hoan in Tempe - very very good. If you go there, try the Banh Uot, super yum"}
{"text":"it is a good restaurant, even it is not Chinese foods, but it is similar to Chinese foods,because they provide Vietnamese rice noodle soup, which is very delicious , the price is very cheap as well.  I remembered I ordered beef pro, lots of soup in that bowl. it is extremely full for eating one beef pro."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love Pho and we are always looking for great Vietnamese food. This is one of our favorites. the staff is quick and quiet and always welcoming. The broth of all the Pho is amazing and I recommend the rare and well cooked beef and of course the spring rolls. We probably eat here about once a week. Great Prices and great Pho."}
{"text":"This plane is outstanding. I regular here with a buddy and every time we arrive the staff is more than welcoming. My favorite is the garlic chicken with brown rice and Thai tea. It makes an outstanding meal. I tried a pork chop once but it was a little too dry for my taste, but overall this is one of my favorite places to eat. The people here are awesome and well deserving of business."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho place in AZ. I've eaten pho almost every week since I was five and have even traveled to Vietnam for a bowl...so I'd like to think I know what I'm talking about when it comes to this amazing dish!! The broth is amazing and they run their restaurant very smoothly from what I can tell. I've never had a mistake on my takeout order...not even a missing spoon (this is important to me). They give you a ton of meat and the spring rolls are incredible!!! The only  part that sucks is that they are closed on Sundays...which is usually the day I want to eat it!!!"}
{"text":"Khai Hoan is my favorite place in the valley to get Pho.  It reminds me of the Pho I've had in San Diego.  They have a lot of flavor.  The service is fast and they package it perfectly when you need to take it to go.  Their spring rolls are phenomenal.  Make sure to try the Thai iced tea as well."}
{"text":"This place got me hooked to Pho Thai.  At one point I was there 3 times a week.  The owner is so personal and friendly.  

The Pho Thai, spring rolls, and fried rice are to die for.  But everything else...no so much.  But the Pho has me hooked.  It gets crowded around lunchtime, so you might have to share a table or call ahead and get your fix to go."}
{"text":"Fantastic pho and other Vietnamese dishes. If all they served was the pho I'd still come here. It's a massive portion and comes with a small cornucopia of goodies to add to the broth: thai basil, bean sprouts, lime and another green I'm quite sure of (good whatever it is). Their fried rice is also quite tasty. 

Prices are great for the quality of the food and the staff is friendly. 

It does tend to get crowded around lunch time, but never 30min wait crazy, or the like.

No bike rack, but they get brownie points for letting me lock my bike to their fence.

If you haven't had pho, you owe it to your taste buds to give Khai Hoan a visit."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I go here weekly to get my pho fix.  Khai Hoan is by far the BEST pho restaurant that I have been to in the valley, and I've been to a few of them."}
{"text":"Liked the combination pho, staff is very friendly, environment is cozy even right before closing at night."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! The food is always fresh and its quality, consistent. The combination starter plate and orange chicken are big favorites with my kids. I haven't eaten anything from the menu that I haven't enjoyed. Price-wise, this place cannot be beaten! The owners genuinely care about their product and their patrons and the staff are helpful, attentive, and friendly. While you don't need to make a reservation, I would suggest phoning ahead to make sure it is open."}
{"text":"What can I say? Khai Hoan has the best Pho that I have tasted in the Phoenix area. 

I generally get the Pho with Rare Beef and Beef Balls. The broth is tasty and not too salty or oily, and the Beef is super tender. 

Also not to miss is the spring rolls. At first sight I was a little weirded out as they looked (and felt) like *ahem* something you may find at the Le Castle Boutique, but that's just how spring rolls are (chef boyfriend says technically they are summer rolls, as spring rolls are fried). But they are TASTY. Peanut sauce, crunchy fresh veggies, fat shrimp. MMMMMMMM I want some right now. 

Last, you MUST get the Vietnamese coffee! You brew it yourself in the cutest little contraption that drips right into a tiny glass of calorie-free sweetened condensed milk. It IS calorie free, right? RIGHT?! When it's done brewing you pour it over a cup of ice and it is DECADENT. 

Go there. Now. And crave it every day thereafter."}
{"text":"The Pho is 10/10 top notch. As good as any I've had in Vietnam. The broth is delicious and the vegetables are high quality and crisp. I ordered it for takeout and they gave me a bowl of broth and separate plastic ziplock bags with the meat, veggies, and a Styrofoam container with the noodles and tripe. That way, the Pho is perfectly fresh when you combine everything. Note that if you get the steak, it is razor thin and raw, but it cooks quickly when you put it into the hot broth; this way the steak is perfectly tender. If you like Pho you should try this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit. I had #2 pho.  Last time, I had #1 pho and it was it was too much. A very kind Japanese waitress told me that they had small portion. (Not on the menu). I ordered that, and it was the perfect portion.  I am pleased with their service.  For sure, I will be back again."}
{"text":"I moved here from LA and this is STILL the best Viet food I've ever had.

the guy (always the same guy working, that's a good sign) is friendly, the food is outstanding and so, so quick!

the place isn't much to look at, but when I have my face shoved into the food it doesn't matter.

interestingly this place also serves the best coffee in Tempe."}
{"text":"Very good, friendly service. We were waiting for some people to join us and they seated us right away and let us wait. 

Nice small place. And some good pho! We have a few favorite place in town and this was up there with them. The spring rolls were ok, good peanut sauce though!"}
{"text":"The best broth in Tempe! Open early and the best hangover cure. So close to campus. The staff is incredibly nice and there are always customers in there at all times of the day."}
{"text":"Amazing! I got take out here one night and will definitely be back. Pho was soo flavorful and delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here because of all the good reviews. The springs rolls were good but a little bland. The peanut sauce tasted like it should, so that was good! 

My husband ordered the spicy garlic chicken with rice. It wasn't spicy at all but it tasted good in comparison to my dish.

I ordered a rice noodle dish (#47) with beef, shrimp, crab, and vegetables. The noodles were horrible (Clumpy and Chewy), the sauce was horribly bland. I ended up dipping my  veggies in my husbands garlic sauce. 

I left unsatisfied and now have a horrible stomach ache from the greasiness I called dinner.

Maybe I just don't get it but this isn't the first time I have had Vietnamese and to me its just not good. 

Sorry"}
{"text":"It's that time of year and they make some of the tastiest Pho around. Also, to go service is on POINT, you're in and out super quick. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Heres a review my to go experience and of the items I ordered:
1-5 Five being best.
1. Pho Ga (chicken pho)-4
rich aromatic broth, slightly too salty- had to water it down when I hot home.
2. Pork Spring Rolls-1
The rice roll itself was very rubbery, the menu says grilled pork it seems like shaved pork thin and with no charred flavor at all.  These were also missing bean sprouts-only had lettuce, mint, and vermicelli noodle.
3. Lemonade-3
SWeeeeeet! If you have a sweet tooth you will love this. Get a Large.
Overall I think its a good stop dine in for Pho. Just not amazing.
The to go packaging melted and my soup was all inside the bag-so dine in.
I was still able to save it by pouring it into a container to reheat."}
{"text":"My group and I ordered Pho Tai, Hu Tieu, the limeade and the Vietnamese iced coffee. 

Good: pho and iced coffee. Coffee has a ton of condensed milk, just like they make it in the motherland. Pho was good, just came in a small bowl and filled to the brim so it was hard to add fixings.

Meh: Hu Tieu, limeade, and pricing. The Hu Tieu was kind of weird as it had a pork/shrimp shu mai in it, along with imitation crab meat, maybe it's a regional spin I'm not familiar with since I was raised on southern style. I still prefer Hu Tieu at Pho Thanh. I get the pricing- it's next to the college. 

Definitely won't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Best pho ever! I love the OG approach to the food speaks for itself and ambiance is not a factor! I have been eating at this gem since the 90s and it has never disappointed. I can see people who are ethnocentric hating on the decor and lack of kitche decor but it's all about the pho!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  My husband, daughter and I go here every Friday.  The best PHO in the whole valley.  Believe me."}
{"text":"Been reviewed many times so I don't need to belabor...nice, clean, owners are very friendly and pricing is very reasonable.

Got spring rolls - solid...
#10 Pho (shrimp / crab) - broth didn't seem to have much flavor and I hit it with the entire arsenal of ngo gai, thai basil, sprouts, sriracha and lime juice. Lots of shrimp though.

Would not hesitate to come back but it's a bit of a travel from my CenPho home."}
{"text":"Delicious pho. Can't review anything else. As a \"vegetarian\", I make an exception for this place, and get the beef broth with the vegetables and tofu (sometimes I ask for half noodles and more veggies). I come here at least 6x a year."}
{"text":"We passed by after the ASU basketball game on a rainy day. Pho sounded like a perfect option on a dark, gloomy day. I ordered the #5 pho. First of all, I was surprised at how slow the service was. Pho is usually out within 5 minutes at most pho places but this definitely took at least 10. Second of all, I was disappointed with the pho itself. The soup lacked flavor and tasted watered down. The noodles were already soggy so they must have taken too long to bring the bowl out. There was a decent amount of meat but that didn't help with the bland taste of the soup itself. It was overpriced for mediocre quality. The side dish they put out was also lacking, the content of 1 lime, 1 jalepeno, bits of mint, and bean sprouts filled up less than half the plate..."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, satisfactory, authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Fried rice is fresh, fluffy, non greasy and delicious. Pork has a nice grilled and marinated flavor. Many varieties of noodles here and very generous with them. Not a fancy place but very nice when you must have these flavors."}
{"text":"When it comes to Pho, good broth is crucial and Khai Hoan does not disappoint.  Unlike other Pho restaurants I've tried in the past, Khai Hoan was very generous with the amount of meat they add to the bowl.  I had the chicken pho and the dish was brought out hot, fresh and with water and lime, all for $8.  For a tasty and authentic bowl of pho in Phoenix at a great value, I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"This is most home food like place to me . Been there countless time when i lived in tempe. Plenty of food, consistent freshness and good quality, friendly owner. Love it!"}
{"text":"Came here on 10/15/14. Been coming here for years..found tiny snails on my mint disgusting wash your damn veggies! Never coming back"}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese (no affiliation to this place, found it 6 mos ago). I've been to pretty much all the places within a 10 mile stretch and I will say this is the best one. You won't regret. I've tried the majority of the Vietnamese menu. Best Pho in town but everything won't disappoint"}
{"text":"Get the Vietnamese coffee - it is decadent. So delicious!

The Pho is wonderful. Their broth is absolutely delicious. I could just eat that. The beef is always tender and they give you just the right amount..not too much, not too little.

The service is good, they bring out your food quickly! Everyone seems very friendly. 

After eating here once, we were hooked. We have been enjoying Pho at least once a week since!"}
{"text":"This place is good. However, I ordered the Chicken Pho and they obviously put turkey meat in there. Not complaining, it was good turkey meat."}
{"text":"My favorite pho restaurant in all of Arizona!! They always provide the best service, food comes out fast, and pho is always hot as it should be. The owner even recognizes us when we come in. HIGHLY recommend. Such a cute place with great service"}
{"text":"The best Pho spot in Tempe, hands down! Small hole in the wall place but their service and food quality is exceptional. I've been coming here ever since I found out about it. The family who runs this place is super nice and friendly and always makes sure you're well taken care of even when the house is full. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, good prices. If you've been to Cyclo in Chandler you should be made aware that this is her sister's restaurant and recipes. Not as flashy but just as good if not better."}
{"text":"This place is great! Let's start with the food.. I began with the springrolls which were awesome. The marinated beef added in is a great touch. I then had the chicken soup, the broth was bursting with flavors. Just enough cilantro and green onion. The pho here is what I have been looking for around ASU. 
Don't forget about the employees! Great people with in hearts.. with great food ad welcoming staff I want to run back right now! Thanks for making my first visit enjoyable, I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is how pho should be made! The flavors, consistency, and temperature were on point. My family and I will def be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"BEST PHO IN THE EAST VALLEY! well, i think so, anyway. 

This place is a gem! don't let the neighborhood fool ya. khai hoan is in a weird little strip mall (as are many of the best restaurants in az) on the other side of haji baba. they redecorated the interior recently so it's not as gritty as it used to be, but the food is still as delicious as ever.

my favorite dish is the #5, well done and tender beef pho with tendons. the broth is superb, the meat and vegetables fresh, the atmosphere authentic. the selection of beverages is also good, with the taro teas and the required drip iced coffee. they even have fresh coconuts and salty lemonade.

it's convenient that the light rail runs right by, but i've been known to drive all the way down from deer valley just for that soup."}
{"text":"Went to Khai Hoan for lunch today with my friend Sam.  Pho is something I've just recently gotten into, and this place was awesome!

Little place, not super easy to find, but worth the effort.  I got the chicken pho - I don't have the huevos to try some of the other things - I just don't do tripe....  As everybody else has said, the broth was delicious, noodles plentiful, and add ins like basil, jalapeno, lime, etc were very fresh.  Couple dollops of sambal oleek and you're good to go!

You get a big honkin' bowl of soup, and it was less than $7.  

The place was totally full by 11:30, so if you go at lunch, keep that in mind.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ever since my first taste of that sweet and mysterious broth nearly 10 years ago, I have been on a quest for the perfect bowl of pho. My domestic journey started with sampling nearly every Vietnamese joint in the Valley from Gilbert to Goodyear. My appetite was insatiable... I even ventured to Vietnam in 2013 with a large motivation being culinary adventure and my love of everything related to pho

I can say with the utmost honesty that I have never come across a better broth in all my experience than that at Khai Hoàn. Is eating pho tai on a low plastic stool in Ho Chi Min City a near religious experience? Yes, of course. Does that mean that this state of beef noodle soup nirvana can only be achieved in the Far East? Absolutely not. 

It can be attained right here in Tempe and we are so lucky for that"}
{"text":"Really good Pho and surprisingly good Chinese food. My daughters, who have lived half their life in Asia, were very impressed when craving some Pho during recent trip to Tempe. The family owners were very nice."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best pho I've ever had!! I love coming to this place. The people who work here are super friendly and the service is great. You get your food right away- hardly any wait. The iced coffee they make with a French press is the absolute best coffee I've ever had too- it's like a dessert. Definitely try the pho! My favorite is pho #3 with the raw beef. If you're in the area and you like pho, try this place!!!"}
{"text":"I just re downloaded this yelp app just so I can make this review! I love this pho restaurant! I normally dine in, and it's always really fast and hot, and the staff is always super friendly and attentive.  This time I ordered the pho to go (#4 beef) and I couldn't be more pleased! I was given more than an ample amount of veggies to add to the soup.  I ordered crab puffs that were hot and crunchy, even a few minutes after i picked it up.  Like always the staff was awesome and my food was perfect!"}
{"text":"The place isnt much to look at and is in a little strip mall setting, but the food was delicious.  Service was great and helpful when it came to the menu, food was fresh and wonderful!  We had the Won Ton soup, a pork chop over fried rice (tons of fried rice), and sliced beef over seasoned white rice."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's so good!! They have vegetarian pho that is just delicious! A lot of places don't have vegetarian broth, so this place gets bonus points for  that. Also, it's really inexpensive and the staff is really friendly and welcoming. Don't forget to order the crab puff appetizer!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: decor matches the style of food, and has a family kitchen feel to it.

Service: service is very quick and courteous.  Our waiter took care of keeping our drinks topped off, and made sure we had enough hot sauce, and garnishes for our pho.

Food: the pho is some of the best around.  The meat is fresh.  The broth is very flavorful, but not too salty.  There are plenty of noodles, and they are well cooked and have a lovely, somewhat firm texture.

The lemongrass chicken is bright and has a unique pleasant texture.  It also comes with a unique cracked rice that holds up well to the dish.  This is the only restaurant I've been to that serves this kind of rice.  I wish more places had it.

Spring rolls are solid, cheap and tasty.  The peanut sauce is a huge winner."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese food I have found in Tempe.  I have been a repeat customer since all the other local places I've tried are about 3.5 stars at most for food.  The reason I gave 5 stars has a lot to do with the service.  They are always very courteous and nice when I come in.  The food is about 4 stars. This is not as good as San Diego, but its the best around Tempe!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese place in the valley and I've been to tons. Their pho broth has a really good flavor and the herbs/greens that come with their meal are crisp/fresh. Their spring rolls are really good. Most people serve it with hoisin sauce, but Khai Hoan has a really tasty peanut sauce to go with it. And their pork isn't just sliced cooked pork, theirs is marinated/grilled so it has a nice smoky flavor.

Try the specials. The banh xeo is like a crepe/omelette and you get 2 huge ones in an order (I only got one when I got take out though....) and the other special (who knows the name), is a fish cake noodle soup that's pretty good too. 

Owner is friendly and service is efficient."}
{"text":"What could be better than going to a restaurant that gives you a choice between Vietnamese & Chinese food?  Nothing wrong with choices!!
Hubby tried the chicken pho and I a grilled pork chop atop pork fried rice.  The latter dish was the recommendation of the waiter (John) when I told him that I wanted pork but nothing with a sweet sauce. 
The pho came with the usual accompaniments: basil, jalapeños, lemon, and bean sprouts.  Hubby had ask them NOT to put noodles in and John suggested they add veggies instead. (Don't you hate a man that watches his figure?)  
He let me taste the broth and I thought it was incredibly delicious.  He thought the chicken was overcooked, but I reminded him that it was chicken breast and thinly sliced so the longer it's in the hot broth the more cooked it gets.  AND  what restaurant is going to chance serving barely cooked chicken? He cleaned his bowl and next time he wants to try the rare beef PHO.  My dish consisted of a very thin pork chop over a bed of fried rice--a real huge portion of rice.  The pork chop was not dry and had a char-like flavor.  The rice was NOT greasy and tasty.  
We really like the customer service here as well as the food.  The pricing is very fair and we felt it was a good value for the money.  Come by sometime."}
{"text":"The food was very good for the price. I had the #23 (Noodles, eggrolls, beef, shrimp) for $8 or so and could only half of it. They want a $10 minimum purchase to process credit/debit cards. 

The service was a little slow, but we go out to eat for the social aspect. There were quite a few people coming in for takeout. 

The restaurant is smaller. There are about 8-10 tables."}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite spot for Ph? within like 10 miles of our house. The Ph? is awesome, I always get the #1 with extra vegetables and it's perfect every time. Spring rolls and egg rolls are a must, the Vietnamese coffee is on point, I only wish they made Banh mi but then I would probably never leave.."}
{"text":"This was always my go to Vietnamese shop. I dont remember when we discovered it but it had to be some time in 2000- 2001. Because i was on the the red line valley metro bus to get to and from work. Its route went back and fourth on Apache blvd. And i worked split shifts with 3 1/2 hours betwee shifts. . So i found places to go get lunch that were right on the red line route. 
I still cannot find a Vietmamese shop here in Portland that does Pho as good as Khai Hoan. I always got the vegan pho. They loaded  it up with a wonderful assortment of vegetables. It was delicious. Bok choy, broccoli, carrots, snow peas, fresh mushrooms, corriander(cilantro) a few tofu,  and fresh ginger. And not just a small amount of vegetables  the bowl was full to the top with these veggies. Instead of rice noodles i would sub clear glass noodles and they had no problem doing that. I didnt care for an overload of noodles so they would always scale back the amount of noodles for me. The added bonus of the side plate of basil, bean sprouts, mint, cilantro , dandelion greens, jalepenos and lime was perfect. So many Vietnamese restaurants will give such a small plate of this which for me is always dissapointing. Khai Hoan gives a full plate of it; as well;  they would bring me some extra fresh chopped ginger. I had become a regular and the waiter knew what i liked and i wouldnt have to ask. 
They get an extra star because they have fresh coconut to drink.

Every place ive been to lately for pho;  fill the bowl with tofu and rice noodles and barely any vegetables at all. Extremely unsatisfying and disappointing. . 


I think they use MSG. But they told me its very minimal. And the vegan pho has no msg. 

Take the light rail east. Get off at Dorsey and walk east on the south side of the street or get off at McKlintock and walk west south side of the street. You'll find Khai Hoan in a shopping plaza right next to a mexican carnarceria and a smoke shop.

I miss you Khai Hoan. Please come to Portland and show them how pho is done right."}
{"text":"Credit cards are accepted for tickets over $10. Friendly service and very quick about getting your order to you especially if you are going here during the lunch crowd. Pho is just the usual nothing outstanding or special."}
{"text":"For this area, they may deserve 5 starts, but was spoiled eating phoe almost weekly in Richardson, TX. Anyway, I'm happy I found this place and that it's close to where I live."}
{"text":"A little hidden, but a great place for Pho! But truthfully, I go there for Hot & Sour. And let me tell you it's a rarity to find Viet food + good Chinese food in the same business. In fact, I don't think I have ever found it. 

My wife will always order the Pho, and I will take little bites, here & there. 

Overall, whenever I go to Tempe I make sure to swing by"}
{"text":"I'm a recent transplant from So Cal and was seriously missing good Vietnamese food. One of my coworkers invited me to check this spot out for lunch one day and I was instantly hooked! Their broth is on point. I also had the fresh shrimp
spring rolls and Thai tea with boba. The peanut sauce for the spring rolls was a little heavy on the peanut butter, could use more hoisin and sugar but the softness of the boba in the Thai tea made up for it. I'm super excited to have found this spot and will return often for my pho fix!"}
{"text":"Super authentic Vietnamese restaurant. It's nestled in the corner of a complex on Apache and is a small, unassuming spot. Parking directly in front of the restaurant can be a little tight because it's busy but there's plenty of parking in the complex. Good to come with a group but is also a more intimate spot. Ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer, they can with peanut dipping sauce and were super delicious. Best spring rolls I've tried. I came here because I was craving pho and ordered their veggie pho. I loved the rice noodles, they were soft but not too thin. Got a huge bowl of soup with lots of veggies, broccoli, bok choy, cabbage, onion, carrots, and mushroom. Also had tofu. The veggie broth wasn't very flavorful but luckily they have trays of sauces and spices on the table so was able to add some chili sauce and soy sauce to get more flavor. They didn't have too many veg options but I was there for the pho so I was happy."}
{"text":"I been visit this restaurant almost 20 years.  I always order the #1 and egg rolls.  It is the best in town!  #27 is great too.  The pho and the soup base is so yummy and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"The Saturday hangover took it's evil course and Vietnamese food was a necessary evil this afternoon. 

I was in Tempe, and my friend and I agreed on Vietnamese. I remembered a past visit here, and had an OK experience. 

I figure with a more relaxed situation (last time was a rush), and a pleasant afternoon, things might be better, and they were.

Just like my last visit, I went with the Bun. It was better than I remember it. More flavorful, the spring rolls were phenom, and as always the service was fantastic.

The only thing that held me back from a five star, was the lack of ice cold air conditioning. 

They had some fans blowing, and it was a tad muggy, but I joked to my lunch date, \"the weather in here is authentic, like Vietnam\". Haha!

Luckily there were no complaints on the other side of the table. My friend ordered the Chicken pho. She downed it like a champ and was very happy. 

Whenever I am in Tempe, I'm definitely hitting up Khai Hoan.  

One last tip.....$10 minimum for credit card. But it shouldn't be a problem."}
{"text":"It was a full house when we got there so had to wait about 5 min to get a table for five. Wasn't too bad at all.

I ordered the \"everything beef\" pho but the smaller version and the size was pretty good def not too big but not too small either. I could still see the red of the sliced beef so it shows me the meat was fresher....i think... Lol

I usually put lime and siracha and hoisin sauce in my soup....then when I squirted some hoisin sauce into my soup I remembered why I didnt like this place the first time I went there... The hoisin sauce was kinda gritty... Idk from what so it was weird to me...nonetheless I still ate it.

The soup itself was not bad but with how I like my soupit's still not upto par with what I truly want...

It was also pricey -er than other Vietnamese places that I have been too...prolly coz it's close to ASU... 

My fam ordred rice place they were okay not bad"}
{"text":"Visited Khai Hoan during a Restaurant Crawl. Loved the Spring Roll and there was one more roll I enjoyed but forgot the name. It was deep fried but not greasy. Vert tasty. I plan to return for some Pho."}
{"text":"Small place and you have to go through the kitchen to use the restroom, but the food is really good! I ate number 43. It was rice with pork and shrimp cake. Amazing!"}
{"text":"The pho is good.  The other food is ok, I just hoping that they serve the food with a regular rice and not the broken rice"}
{"text":"I'm a stickler when it comes to PHO, so this place falls under 3-star territory for me. The reason for this is because the beef PHO usually has pretty well-done (dry) meat in it and the broth is inconsistent. Sometimes it's rich and fantastic, other times, a little on the bland side. Their spring rolls however, are very good and I couldn't resist them whenever I would 
drop in. 

Khai Hoan is a decent lunch spot in Tempe for those looking for a PHO fix. I'm not into the Chinese side of their menu, and they are by no means the best the valley has to offer. I prefer the PHO places in Phoenix, but these folks are friendly, prices are cheap, and they get the job done. Then again...there's also Haji-Baba just a stone's throw away."}
{"text":"Small restaurant, clean. They only have one size pho on the menu for $8.95. The beef pho was so good we came back again on a Sunday but they were closed so we came back the next day. We ask if they can make us a large bowl with extra noodle and beef. I expected they would charge more but it was only $1 extra. The bean sprouts and garnishing are fresh also. The Ca Phe Sua Da (ice coffee with condensed milk) was good also."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and the food was delicious. 

The name of the appetizer is escaping me, but it was rice paper, hot water, and big plate of fresh herbs, meats and veggies so you could wrap your own spring rolls. We weren't very successful at wrapping our rolls, so we ate a deconstructed version. Still yummy, and the waiter did warn us that it wasn't a good dish for beginners. 

Boyfriend went with the pho, and he gave it two thumbs up. I ended up going with the Hu Tieu, which is made with either egg noodles or glass noodles. I really enjoyed it, but was full before I even made it halfway through my soup. I will definitely come back to try this again next time I'm in the mood for soup."}
{"text":"I swear I did a review a year ago . . . 

This little restaurant hits a home run everytime I've been there.  Their crispy egg rolls are fantastic, and their pho is the gold standard.  

That's all you should need to hear.  Go there NOW"}
{"text":"As a Vietnamese person myself, I'm pretty sure I can recognize good pho. While I am well aware California is the best for pho, as a resident of Arizona I think Khai Hoan is excellent.

The pho broth is nice and light. Also, the Mi Xao is done excellently. I always order the appetizer sampler with my brother (Spring roll, egg rolls, crab puff, and fried shrimp) and the variety of flavors was superb! The prices are relatively cheap too - which is a good thing as it's a 10 minute walk from ASU and accesible by the light rail.

It's a bit of a mixed opinion here, but my friends ordered Chinese food at this Vietnamese restaurant (-_-;) and I got conflicting opinions. One guy said that his was awesome, while the other said some of his chicken was uncooked. However, I get fried rice from time to time, and that's done perfectly.

If this is your first time, I suggest starting with the pho tai (#3). If you're THE culinary expert on pho and don't like it, just shut up and eat. As of now it's the best pho in Arizona, and it's a nice change of flavor for those who haven't eaten Vietnamese in a while, or ever!"}
{"text":"I had the spring roles and the #3 pho with thin slices of rare beef in it. The spring roles were great, they had shrimp and pork in them and were fresh. The pho was AWESOME!! Great portions, fresh and flavorful. They brought the standard plate of fixings and I loved everything I added to it. Friendly, efficient service and a clean environment. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, all things considered. I ordered the eggrolls, bun bo hue and then the Che. All tree cost around $20 and I would return. Pretty authentic restaurant and there is a fish tank to stare at if you're eating alone like I was haha. The eggrolls came with four and they were actually decently sized. The food filled me up and the noodles were adequately portioned"}
{"text":"Wish I had found this little joint a long time ago. Im Gunna make it plain and simple the best pho I have had. The best bun I have had. And I know they put crack cocaine in their orange chicken. I almost hate going there because I can't choose which one of the three to get when I roll up to eat there."}
{"text":"First I would like to say that Pho is overrated. It is pretty much the same everywhere, and it is delicious everywhere. I am not going to try to convince you to try Pho, because I never order it myself.

I usually order Bun, which is a dish of room-temperature vermicelli rice noodles on a bed of cucumbers, greens, and basil. On the top of all of this deliciousness is usually some sort of meat, usually pork or beef. I personally like the combination of spring rolls, shrimp, and pork/beef. Over all of this is what is called a fish sauce, but doesn't have a fishy taste and is rather sweet and savory.

The Bun at Khai Hoan is comparable to all the other Bun dishes I've had in the past. I feel that Bun and Pho are two Thai dishes that are difficult for restaurants to screw up.

Before you leave, don't forget to get a Thai iced or hot tea. It's inexpensive, delicious, and they have to-go cups."}
{"text":"Such great food every single time. Always a good mix of company in there, and so authentic. The first and best Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to"}
{"text":"Very good Pho! Fast friendly service. This is an easy recommendation. The Vietnamese Coffee is also solid."}
{"text":"Super good! Spring rolls were good,  but the fried pork lumpia was FANTASTIC! We even ordered another 4 (amount per plate) for home to shove shamelessly into our faces. Beef pho was good, but i liven it up with chile oil (kept in back-available upon request). Great!"}
{"text":"The best place for pho hands down. 

What are the most important factors in determining the worthiness of a pho restaurant? 

The clever use of \"pho\" in the restaurant name? exa: What the pho? phoking good?
- NO

The freshness of the bean sprouts, and herbs they give you?
-NO (but this hardly is ever the case)

The Broth?
-YES
 This is the most important facet of pho, the broth pulls everything in the bowl together. Having said that the broth here is superb! Compared to other pho joints in the valley Khai Hoan's broth is by far the most unique and best tasting. The broth is savory, with a deep flavor. It is not sweet or salty, it is perfectly balanced. This place is small and quaint, they let their food speak for itself. Their selling point is in their broth. 

Springrolls
- Good portions of meat in the spring rolls. Generous shrimp and pork cuts. The peanut sauce is thick and sprinkled with fresh grounded peanuts. Its the best peanut sauce in my opinion. The sauce attaches itself to the spring roll, unlike other pho joints where the sauce is watery and thus upon dipping, the rolls do not retain much sauce and displeases my deprived taste buds of gravy peanut sauce. Khai hoans peanut sauce has the texture of Kindergarten glue, its great. I also use it to dip the meat from the pho!"}
{"text":"Not from this State but I've been having to do a lot of work in Tempe lately.  Every time I'm there I visit this place at last once to get my Pho Fix.  Comparison to some great Pho places in Monterey park CA.?  This ranks with some of the best I've had Pho-sure"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. .. fast service ...

Maybe it was me but the Pho ok.  The broth was weak and lacked flavor.   My main gripe is the amount of noodles you get.  A TON OF THEM.   I had to scoop out over 1/2 of them to get to the meat and broth."}
{"text":"This is some of the Best Vietnamese Food the valley. Nice little Family Owned and Operated hole in the wall restaurant in a tiny strip mall in Tempe. You will always see the same friendly family members there providing great tasty food and service. Inside is clean and cozy but simple. Gets busy really quick at lunch. On many of my visits there for lunch I see our hard working local law enforcement and fire fighters taking a break and enjoying a quick meal before they get back to work. Some of the tables are round and ready for a large group.

I love the Pho there. It is so much better than some of the others in town and is packed with flavor. It comes with a plate of bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos and some lime wedges. The table also has all the condiments you may want such as schricha, housin sauce, fish sauce, etc. The Glass and Egg Noodle Soups are fantastic as well. Try the Bun which is very tasty and is an Angle Hair Noodle dish with the meats of you choice topped with scallions, peanuts, fried shallots and served over chopped red lettuce, herbs, cucumbers, sprouts and yummy fish sauce. One of my favorites is a specialty dish call Pho Ap Chao and is a plate of fried Crispy Rice Noodle Cake with Shrimp, Crab, Beef and all sorts of Veggies covered in a delicious light brown garlic sauce. So good.

Everything is great here and they have too many dishes to explain them all. They also serve a large selection of Chinese food for those who are not in the mood for something different. Simply Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho, 1st time here, came with Vietnamese friend who says it's the best in the valley.  I agree."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch. Got a combination pho. The broth was highly disappointing. No spices. Would have been better with a chicken broth. $10 for the pho. Not much ingredients in it either. Maybe their other dishes are better, but would not come back"}
{"text":"I've had pho all over the country...and in some of the more \"Asian centric\" cities...however I have yet to come across any other restaurant that is serving better Vietnamese food, especially the pho, than Khai Hoan.  

I've been going to Khai Hoan for about 4 years now and I've never had a complaint.  The food, taste and quality, service and pricing is outstanding.  

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"4.5 rounding up to 5.

My favorite pho restaurant in the Phoenix metropolitan area. I went to college at ASU, so I used to frequent this place at least once a week. I've had everything from their noodles - pho tai, bun rieu, bun bo hue, to their lunch specials - orange chicken, fried rice, etc and can't say I've ever been disappointed. Their soup for all their noodle dishes are very flavorful and well-portioned.I used to come here so often the owner would just ask - \"the usual?\" 

Khai Hoan definitely has a special place in my heart :)"}
{"text":"The best Pho in the valley!!! And there may be better Pho out there  but I have not had it so as far as I an concerned it's the best Pho on the planet!!! And the spring roles are good too! :)"}
{"text":"It was a cool night here near Phoenix, AZ. Fall is upon us - which means - Pho!!! Soup for the soul! Thanks to Yelp my girlfriend found a hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant. Mostly Vietnamese. First off, the ambiance is more like a hall versus restaurant, but it was well done. It is kinda loud - but you can still hear the people at your table.

The service was great, the prices were super reasonable and the food was fantastic. I would come here again...

A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"So the other day, I was in the mood for sushi at my usual spot (Sakana).  

Unfortunately, they were closed for lunch, so the next choice was some pasta at Caffe Boa next door.  Also closed for lunch.  Double Shit!!  

Pasta Pomodoro?  Their tortellini alfredo rocks!!  Then I find out all of their AZ locations closed.  Triple shit!!  

Stomach is growling and quickly getting pissed off.  Okay, Haji Baba then.  

Bessie gets me there in record time but alas, the place was PACKED, even for a 2pm lunch.  What to do?  

Wait...there's that little Vietnamese joint a few doors down, that I've always wanted to check out but just never did.

Well, I guess they say better late than never for a reason.  I popped in, grabbed a seat and was quickly served up one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes.  Deelish is all I can say.  Now I've got a new little spot to add to my local list of favorites."}
{"text":"Great place. Authentic, fast, courteous.  My favorite lunch spot in Tempe"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Tempe. Nothing fancy about the place. Very basic restaurant and you have to cross the kitchen to go to the bathroom. But the food is to the point. I got the pho tai bam. And it was delicious . The veggies on the side were not that fresh but it was end of the day. My girlfriend got the shrimp cake and pork with rice. It was delicious. 3 stars for stale veggies though."}
{"text":"BEST SPRINGROLLS IN THE VALLEY!!! Great chicken pho as well - stay away from the rice dishes."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time.  Why do people like it so much?  I think that there are way better Viet places not very far away. I ordered rare beef pho. The bowl was quite small - not \"gigantic\" like some of the reviewers are saying.  Small.  Smaller than I am used to, and i didn't order a small bowl.  There was only one size choice and that's what I ordered.  I think it was $6.50.  The broth was salty and not very tasty and the rare beef wasn't very rare. 1 1/2 rounded up to 2."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix, driving crosstown, and this location was about midpoint... we followed our gps directions, and there we were... about 8:30, the place was almost full, with one table available, an auspicious sign!  We ordered, watched big bowls of steaming pho come out, and ah yes, ours came too... i got vegetables and tofu, in chicken broth to soothe an incipient cold, my husband got a rice dish with chicken,,, both were excellent!  One of the owners came by, apologized for our having to wait as they were busy and short handed... we hadn't felt ignored at all, but did have a nice conversation with him about Phoenix and that we'd all escaped Southern California traffic... very good food, very pleasant interaction.  Don't come expecting fancy, but come hungry looking for a tasty meal!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and have been for a few years now.  I eat Pho anytime I am feeling sick and it knocks the illness on it's ass!  I went to pick some up since my man had a sore throat and I knew it would make him feel better.  For $15 I got Chicken Pho, crab puffs and spring rolls. $15 dollars!  This fed myself, my man and his brother.  It was a Monday night, the place was packed but it still took only 10 minutes to get my food.  While I was waiting 2 of my friends walked in.  Winner winner chicken dinner!"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves a killer pho ap chao - it makes my taste buds dance in ecstasy, it is so good.  This place is tucked away in the recessed end segment of a long strip mall on Apache Blvd, so it's easy to miss if you're not looking out for it. Service is fast, and the food is relatively inexpensive - prices are just a tad over those of most Vietnamese restaurants in the Valley. Their pho is OK, though I find the flavor to be somewhat one-dimensional, without the herbal complexity of the pho in, say, Pho Thanh or Pho Avina. And I find the pho to be a bit on the salty side. A squeeze from the lime wedge served on the side helps cut the saltiness, while the fresh herbs served alongside the pho help to give the flavor a needed boost."}
{"text":"One of the best pho places in town!!  The owners are very friendly and service is good."}
{"text":"The Pho was pretty good. The chicken fried rice had no vegetables in it and the chicken was very suspicious."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for pho! The best customer service and the best pho I've had. The owner already knows what we order which is pretty awesome.  I'd recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Great Pho, would have gave them 5 stars however they don't serve a nice slab of tendon they shave it thin. Other than that this is the 1st really good bowl of Pho I have had in Phx."}
{"text":"I was absolutely starving and I decided to stop here. The manager came by and offered me some suggestions from the menu and both were very delicious. The spring rolls with the peanut sauce was amazing. And the bun pho was  amazing."}
{"text":"There peanut sauce is terrible,  Pork in the bun was dry and chewey.  Went there because of the ratings and never will go back.  Why were there no Vietnamese people eating there?  That should tell you something right away that they avoid it."}
{"text":"It was pretty good, but definitely not my favorite pho in the valley. Skippy on the veg and just a little too much star anise in the broth for my taste."}
{"text":"Loves it.  For only a small amount of $$ I leave the place with take-out feeling like I just went grocery shopping.  The portions are crazy big.  The ingredients are fresh.  The taste is spot on when I'm craving vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Been here a few times already and while the atmosphere + service is very basic, that's kinda what I like about this place as well. The food here is pretty good depending on what you get though:

Seafood Pho = Just okay as I wasn't much of a fan for the broth. The actual seafood was fine but overall I probably wouldn't order pho from here again.

Broken Rice Plate (Grilled Pork) = Food was great but it was quite pricey considering how close this restaurant is to the university.

Chicken With Broccoli (Lunch Special) = First item I tried from the Chinese menu and it was not bad at all, not to mention great value for lunch time.

Since I live close by to here I'll most likely frequent this place. The Pho was disappointing but everything else has been good so far."}
{"text":"This was first time ever trying Pho. I wanted to try it due to all the good reviews. It did not disappoint. I had the Pho and quail plate. Both were full of fresh, clean, light flavors. Service was delightful and the location seemed to be very clean. Will try again."}
{"text":"The worst Vietnamese place I've been to, as a Vietnamese if you want authentic Vietnamese food I suggest you go somewhere else. I had bún bò Hu but it was nothing authentic like it. The beef in the soup seem like they used left over beef cause there was a horrible smell. The food was way too over price. It's made for caucasian that's not familiar to Southeast Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"OVERALL: I'll be back, and probably very soon.

THE GOOD
- The service. It was incredibly speedy (unlike previous pho experiences) and everyone was incredibly friendly. I actually noticed many patrons knew the employees well enough to ask about family and recent trips!

- The broth. So good. While I was too full to finish the massive amount of tasty noodles, I still made sure to drink all my broth!

- The price. For a huge, delicious, satisfying meal and taking home enough for later, $12 wasn't bad at all. I definitely didn't need the appetizer of spring rolls and that would've knocked me down to $8 easy.

THE BAD
- Being new to this restaurant, I walked in a bit aimless. There was no one waiting to greet and seat, but at the same time this isn't self serve. I walked up and asked if I should seat myself and grabbed a menu, but the guy behind the counter acted like that was a bit out of the norm. It was mildly awkward.

- This restaurant is quite casual and *almost* divey, in that each table has its own napkins, spoons, chopsticks, etc. The table I sat at had only 2 napkins left and very little chili paste, but I didn't see anyone moving to restock it anytime soon.

THE UGLY
- Good pho has a bit of a kick to it, and Khai Hoan doesn't disappoint... so when your water runs low or completely out, it's a bit of a bummer. They did refill it eventually, but it took them longer than my mouth wanted."}
{"text":"I have tried this places multiple times before finally deciding to write a review. This is kind of mom and pop restaurant. It's small, but the décor is quite nice and neat, they even have a big fish tank right next to the cashier counter.

The service is fast and sufficient enough. We love the owner and his wife because they are way so nice and always greet us with firm handshakes and warm hugs.

About the food, so far I have tried #2 (Special House Pho), #15, #25, #55 and some other plates as well. I can say that the #2 House Pho I still my first option, everything else just doesn't fit with my taste. Also, #55 which is the rice cake place with grilled pork and pork roll sparks my interest, but the grilled pork is way too dry and lack of moist. 

We will come back for the Pho because no where else can beat them around this area. It would be nice to sit down and have a bowl of hot soup during lunch time at this place."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. The food is good and the vibe is nice. I typically go to pho43 in Phoenix but this place is solid as well. The place looks clean and the pho and portions are great.  Definitely suggest this spot."}
{"text":"First time visit today! Flavorful, rich broth. Service made the experience even better. Very helpful and kind. I will go back!"}
{"text":"Some of the most bomb pho this state has to offer.  I can vouch for the Pho Tai, the Bun/noodle salad dishes, and the wonton noodle soup dealio.  Plus, the old dude who works there is a pretty friendly guy unlike most Asian-hole-in-the-wall establishments that put customer service dead last.  Thus, the food is good, the prices are fair, and the workers are friendly.  Why not eat here?"}
{"text":"Pho is amazing, nice people.  Everything I want from a restaurant.  My go to Pho place."}
{"text":"Great place for college students.  The young Asian server is very friendly as well as the serving staff.  The pho was salty but the portion was great. The bun was good.  The restaurant has poor signage and so spotting the restaurant was not easy."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, the broth was so flavorful. Came in one day, slid over the tray of condiments and hey what do you know, cockroach. Tried to brush it off, moved over to a new table. The waitress brought us thai tea.. tiny roach in the thai tea. By this time, we got up and left. The owner followed us out and says \"You're not coming back are you?\" F**k no I am not! Beware, you have been warned. Contacted the health department, you can find my email in the pics above =)"}
{"text":"This place used to be my place to go for pho, but then I had a bad experience (the water tasting funny and the veggies not being so fresh) and decided to try some other places.  (This was during the summer however and I will say that based on the 6 years of living here in Tempe, many of the restaurants that stay open during the summer start to falter with the quality and freshness of their food.  A problem which I hope will be rectified this summer.)   But, given that it has been quite chilly lately and school is still in, I recently decided to give this place another try.

I agree with all the other reviews about this place.  The pho, the portions, the price, and the service are all very good.  No problems with the freshness of the veggies this time.  But I am still adverse to the water (I think it is non-filtered tap water) and one of the lettuce leaves that came with my egg rolls still had some dirt on it.  

Also, note that this place, given the weather and its size, was packed during the usual lunch hour when I visited.  But, the table turnover was pretty quick and you only have to wait a few minutes if at all to get a table.  But, you might have to share a table with someone if you are a single."}
{"text":"Top 2 or 3 Pho places in town. They also have some great Chinese dishes for those who are scared to try, or just don't like Vietnamese food. Our kids love the orange chicken here. 

I recommend the pho tai or the grilled pork over vermichelli noodles. They also have fresh coconuts to drink! 

Forget cyclo (waaaay over rated) hit this place up!"}
{"text":"Khai Hoan is a strip mall Vietnamese restaurant in Tempe that feels oddly familiar, like that classmate's sibling you never knew in high school that added you on LinkedIn eight years later. Oddly. Familiar. 

The restaurant was relatively empty in the middle of the week for lunch. It seemed like there weren't many nearby workplaces that generated lunch traffic; maybe Khai Hoan kills the delivery game. 

The spring rolls were quite pleasant. Anytime I can dip a bunch of cellophane noodles into peanut sauce, I will. You can take that to the bank. I recently had some awful spring roll experiences with old taco lettuce, so Khai Hoan was refreshing.The vegetarian pho was fine. I'm wasn't loving the bok choy, but the broth was satisfying enough. The portions felt small, but Khai Hoan was otherwise affordable. 

I might be spoiled by living in Houston, where Vietnamese is the most spoken language after English and Spanish. Khai Hoan reminded me of the first time I had Vietnamese food back in high school in Kansas City: If I didn't know what I liked, then I would default to liking the dish. The only thing is, I do know what I like these days. 

I would come back and try other vegetarian dishes if I were in Tempe again."}
{"text":"If you ever want to schlep it, come here at any given time and you will always be guaranteed a good bowl of pho. It's not fancy and perfect for those bum days. It's loud with every language thrown out there, reminds me of UN conference meeting. Love it! Food is consistently good. I mean I've been coming here since my ASU days, probably my longest standing relationship. I love that you can ask for Extra Large bowls!!! If you're adventurous, they have everything from tripe to pork blood in their pho soups. The egg rolls have the just right crunch for rolling up in lettuce to dip. One of the rare places that also carries good banh mi. I also love their rice plates, both the shrimp and pork are really good flavors of grilling.

If you rather be fancier, you can go to their sister location Cyclo, literally owned by one of the other sisters. I personally like the girl next door types so you can find me here."}
{"text":"Sort of a family run place with the best Pho in the valley. Nothing fancy going on here, just good eats. I've never ordered anything except the Pho, so can't speak to the rest of the menu... But really, why would you order anything else?"}
{"text":"Finally found a great Vietnamese restaurant in the valley!  I had the beef and shrimp rice noodle bowl for lunch.  Everything was perfect.  The seasoning on the beef and shrimp, the noodles, the fish sauce, and roasted peanuts.  Can't wait to go back.  This place will be in my regular lunch rotation.  It was packed for lunch, so a short wait may be expected if you go during peak lunch time.  It's worth waiting for if you have to!"}
{"text":"Such great pho and portions for a great price! Super tasty food and friendly service."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Pho places and so far this one is the best. I've lived in Cali, AZ, NV and now IN and nothing beats this place. I want me some Rare Beef Pho with the best broth I've ever had. 
I was introduce to this place by a friend a year before I left AZ, and I'm sad I didn't get to experience it the whole 4 years I lived there. Now I live in IN and I have a feeling I'll have to wait a long time before I get to slurp be up some good stuff."}
{"text":"This was a great find! We had phô ga and the phô with beef and tendon and an order of spring rolls. The rolls and peanut sauce were good, the broth was tasty, and the service was good."}
{"text":"Best Pho and Best Pork Fried Rice on the planet. Hands down!"}
{"text":"Eat here once, sometimes twice a week. I can only speak for the pho, but it's among the best I've had, and the staff is on top of it."}
{"text":"Authentic. Vietnamese Cuisine.  If you're looking for a great Vietnamese restaurant with great food, authentic to the culture stop by Khai Hoan!  Owned and operated by a very nice Vietnamese couple you can tell they really care about their customers and the quality of their food.  Great Pho, and my wife loves the Bun Cun (probably spelling it wrong).  My wife is Vietnamese and this is one of their favorite spots in town.  Try it, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Reasons you should eat here:

1 - You live in Tempe.
2 - You haven't had pho.
3 - You like pho.
4 - You are vegetarian and want to eat pho.
5 - You like bún.
6 - You like small restaurants where you'll get to know the owner.

When I used to live in Tempe I would go there often for pho, and I've introduced lots of my friends to pho for the first time here. Khai Hoan is home to the best pho you'll find in Tempe, hands down. So many places have opened up in the surrounding East Valley that Vietnamese is kind of becoming a PHOlooded market (ouch, that was rough), but I can say that it's got Tempe on lock without a doubt. The #5 is probably my favorite, but it might be a bit much for newbies, so go with the pho ga (chicken). Khai Hoan is also great because it is one of the few pho places, that I know of, that serve veggie pho (not in the pho section of the menu, but the veg section), and it is loaded with delicious vegetables! It's best to come during the evening if you want pho because the broth only gets better as the day goes on. Another great item on the menu is the bún. I feel that bún is way overlooked at Vietnamese places, but it's a great if you're not feeling soup; get it with the egg rolls on top! Lastly, the owner is awesome! I went in there so often that he basically already knew what I was going to order the second I walked in the door, and that's great service."}
{"text":"I don't get it. 

Let me clarify by saying I am Asian-American and I've eaten authentic homemade food all my life. 

I had to come visit this joint because of all the reviewers who claim it's to 'die for'. 

Perhaps I am spoiled living in the land of the Northwest and great Asian food. 

Location was hard to find (even with GPS) because of the giant tree and not greatly signed storefront. When I finally found it and walked in, it wasn't too crowded but not too slow either. 

The owner didn't seem 'that' thrilled to serve me & my girlfriend and was quite rude in the way he'd cut you off mid-order to ask if you wanted beef or pork. 

I opted out of Pho because some reviewers had said they never tried anything else. A good judge of a restaurant is that it can make more than the noodle soup. 

So I went with the spring rolls as well as the bun thit nhuong. For those who aren't familiar, it's the vermicilli noodles & charbroiled pork. 

My dish came out and it was definitely not 'traditional'. Instead of the meat on skewers or even charbroiled, it was just sliced meat on my noodles. 

It was nothing to write home about and the owners/wait staff seemed bored as hell. It was a Monday night and the place seemed busy but I imagine when you live in AZ - you don't get much authentic Asian food. 

Skip it unless you're wanting to say you had Pho."}
{"text":"The pho at this place is amazing. I always get the seafood one. The flavoring on the broth is excellent. The prices are very inexpensive, and the staff is always friendly. I have had pho at many places in the valley, and I always come back to this place. It just can't be beat. I wish they were open on Sunday, but I think it's nice they can spend time with their family. Family owned/operated business owners never get a day off."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in town. The pho is incredible. Always busy, but quick and efficient service."}
{"text":"The Pho is outstanding, the spring rolls are fresh, delicious, and plentiful, and the atmosphere is exactly what you look for and expect when going to a Vietnamese restaurant. I personally love the demeanor of the owners/cooks/employees. They have a very direct and no-frills approach to their business, but they always deliver an excellent meal. I first visited two weeks ago, and I have already been back three times since. For anyone who is less adventurous with food, their Chinese dish offerings are surprisingly delicious. My roommate is not a fan of Pho, but has gone with me three times to Khai Hoan because he loves their Kung Pao Beef. The Pho Tai Nam is my personal favorite. 

One note: Make sure you take cash if you plan on spending less than $10 (which is easily possible, given that any Pho dish is less than $8). There is a restaurant policy that anything charged must be greater than $10. However, I highly suggest ordering the spring rolls along with any dish. You will spend the allotted minimum and come away more than satisfied."}
{"text":"Just landed from Phoenix airport , craving Vietnamese made a quick stop . Food was very good !"}
{"text":"The Pho is delicious.  The owner [Sonay] is hilarious. All the staff are really sweet.  And, they just did a bit of redecorating.

This is a good place to take a date.  Just don't go there too regularly with the same person as Sonay might end up liking your Ex more than you and then once you've moved on and started seeing other people Sonay will give you flak for it and only let up once he feels comfortable enough interrogating your newest romantic interest and is sufficiently impressed with that person's responses.  I'm just speaking from experience... and it's all in good fun."}
{"text":"Being a San Jose native, I know Pho and Vietnamese cuisine. Let me tell you, Khai Hoan is excellent.  Definitely the best I have had in AZ and comparable to the best noodle houses in San Jose.  

The pho (rice noodle soup) is great- beef or chicken.  The dry noodles and rice dishes are generous portions, and very tasty.  Great ingredients in everything.  Make sure you get an order of spring rolls.  . .   

If you have not had Vietnamese food, check it out!  It is fantastic.  If you have had Vietnamese, go to Khai Hoan and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for good Vietnamese, and the Yelp reviews pointed me here.  (Thanks, yo!)  

My pal Amy never had Vietnamese before, so I gave her the intro via some pho tai, pork spring rolls and some ca phe sua (hot coffee with condensed milk).  It was a hit.  And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.

Solid broth, fresh veggies, standard mom-and-pop Vietnamese place atmosphere, friendly waitstaff who was also very happy to leave us alone (which I like).  

Yum!"}
{"text":"Dammit all, I don't care if it's hot! I want some steamy delicious pho! I tried it for the first time a couple weeks ago and it was broth-slurping good. Eggrolls were scrumptious, too. Was pretty disappointed by the \"crepes,\" The menu said they were stuffed with pork and there were just a few little straggling bits of meat inside. That's not \"stuffed!\""}
{"text":"Looked up this place on Yelp for a PHO restaurant on a stormy rainy day. It's a small nondescript store in a small strip mall. The menu had a lot of items and we ordered the #1 Pho and the Bun Bo Hue. The Pho was kinda bland and the added meats were small. The Bun Bo Hue was a little better but not one of the better BBH that I have tried. All in all the meal was quick inexpensive 2 min from the ASU field and the service was good."}
{"text":"I chose this place because of rating on yelp. But really, 4 stars? According to the reviews Pho might be good but about what we took can't say the same. Sorry! I would love to see white meat of chicken instead of fried skin. Not everything seemed to be fresh... :("}
{"text":"Such an excellent hole-in-the wall Vietnamese restaurant! The broth in my seafood pho was incredibly rich and delicious. I am always impressed by the minimal wait time for food and service."}
{"text":"If I could do 3 1/2 stars I definitely would. 

Went here with a friend to have some late-night pho. The deciding factor was, not only the fact that they had decent ratings, but they were one of the only pho places in the Tempe area that is open past 8PM, which is nice for students who work or have late classes. 

The place itself really is average. Very casual setting, awkward huge fish tank in the corner, and workers eating in front of you. But hey, it's really not that bad when you go with someone who can hold conversation. 

Pork and shrimp spring rolls are of very good quality, the veggies/meats are fresh, and they're not overly-covered with rice paper. The pho is very good. It is not too oily, which is a huge plus. The veggies are nice and fresh, and it is served piping hot, which is what I like compared to warm soup. 

Service is a bit below average, but it really isn't expected at such a casual place like this. I will be back for some night-time pho!"}
{"text":"I have my own pho place to call my own, but I admit that I was won over by their pho. I love the texture of their noodles and meat, but wasn't all that impressed with their spring rolls and bun. I think it's a pretty nice place to go to though, so people should stop by for a bite."}
{"text":"Have to admit, I have not had their pho so I can not comment on that. Love the banh cuon! Its so good! Fresh, soft rice rolls filled with a minced pork & mushroom mixture served with fish sauce vinaigrette. It's topped with egg rolls or cha (sliced pork roll) or a combination of both. You get to choose. It's one of the best banh cuon I've had and I will continue to come here for it."}
{"text":"I was visiting my son and we stopped here for lunch one day.  From the Yelp reviews, we ordered egg-rolls and banh cuon.  Both were delicious!  The rice banh cuon were filled with ground pork and fresh.  We chowed down our lunches in short order."}
{"text":"I've tried a few places around Tempe and Mesa...  This one is off University in a small strip mall.. not too hard to find.  Its a cute little resteraunt. Take out and dine in are always quick.  The broth is always so hot i never have to worry getting home in time for it to cook properly.. SO good.. but doesnt  beat Pho Than Bros!"}
{"text":"Went two days in a row for the Chicken Pho.  It was very good.  Chicken was tenders.  Broth was very good.  Nothing fancy about this place, just good food and nice people.  Still not sure if seat yourself or not.  You just kind of walk in and meander over to a seat and wait for them to meet eyes with you and then it just happens, the reciprocal head nod which says, yeah...have a seat right there."}
{"text":"if you love pork, #16 is ridiculously amazing at this place. Spring rolls are glory to the tongue, and food is out quicker than some. Great service, great food. Just go already..."}
{"text":"Banh cuon is fresh and so bun thit nuong cha gio. Huge portions, reasonable price and friendly service. Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Nice Vietnamese and Chinese Restaurant , pleasant atmosphere good service and their yummy delicious Pho is served with fresh aromatic condiments . I am glad we found Khái Hoán Restaurant . We will be definite be coming back here the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Love the pho, but I tried a bun dish last time I went..this is the definition of summer food. Light and refreshing, and it came with an eggroll on top. I wish it hadn't because now I am addicted to them. They have vermecelli in them, its the most amazing texture! Pho and eggrolls are a MUST!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had the number 8 and 9 pho (beef and chicken). The food was great. Almost as good as Miss Saigon in Tucson, but what sets this place apart is the owner and his staff. Everyone is really friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place, by far the best spring rolls I've had in Arizona aside from homemade. Their bun bo hue and pho are always delicious; great broths, fresh veggies and perfectly cooked meats. Also, their customer service is always great, every server or counter person you pay with has a smile on their face. Me and my boyfriend come here every now and then, either to sit down or for take out and it's never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Ordered the #1 \"Everything Pho\" and shrimp rolls. Food was good- small little joint. I don't usually eat Vietnamese food but I wanted it for the health benefits today, so I feel a cold coming on. Food was good and I will probably go back if I want it again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service!!! Loved the pho and the the egg rolls are a must!!!
Iced coffee can't be beat!!!"}
{"text":"OK. I had high hopes for this place. But unfortunately it fell far from what the reviews people posted about it. Maybe because it was 745pm -8 ish when we arrived, but the flavor wasn't there. I compare it to my favorite place Pho Than on 17th Ave and Camelback and it wasn't even close. There was a ton of flavor missing! No matter how much Hoisen sauce and siracha sauce, couldn't get the flavor I'm use to. There is another place on the corner of Rural and University that has WAY better tasting broth which is literally all you base Pho on. The true deal was the service.  We sat down and ordered and our food was on our table within 15 mins."}
{"text":"Delightful authenticity punctuated with new Vietnamese dishes I never had before - the boi cuon. Very friendly service- when they got my order wrong they brought out the egg roll without charging me extra. Clean, no fussy good food.  A gem."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend and wanted to have pho. I looked up restaurants on yelp and found this restaurant. 
I arrived here around 11:15am, and it wasn't busy.

My pho came very fast and was good. The broth is savvy and flavorful. Lots of meat and enough veggies. The portion is generous. 
You will have to spend at least $10 to use credit card. 
Walking distance from the light rail station. I will be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing place the pho with extra ox tail is to die for..... The spring rolls with peanut sauce is amazing and their iced coffee hits the spot!!!! I drive out of my way  30 minutes just to have it! And awesome workers always so happy to see such a close crew and family."}
{"text":"The beef soup in Pho is outstanding. It seems a little bit salty at first place, but it is perfect when you eat with rice noodle. I also like medium rare beef in Pho. However, they put some beef organ in the soup which I don't eat it. You might tell the chef not to put that organ in a bowl. The owner is service-minded and nice.

BBQ dish is also great, but the egg was too dry. The cons side of the restaurant is that they don't have proper restroom for customer. I have to walk pass kitchen to the stuff restroom."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the number 7 
The pho was okay... it was average ive been to pho places that tastes better but what really made me upset was they dont accept card unless you buy 10$ worth or more so i ordered the chicken fried rice hoping it was better.

The chicken fried rice was....... well the rice first of all didnt have any vegetables it was just chicken and rice fried....(?) is that normal? Most fried rice i get from pho restaurants have at least onions or peas or carrots lmao but yeah it lacked flavor although they had a large portion size??? 

Would not come again"}
{"text":"Good pho is so hard to find. This place has amazing pho!! My boyfriend and I are from Cali where the Vietnamese food is amazing. Since we've moved here we were looking for a pho spot that would remind us of Cali. The pho here is so delicious!! The broth is perfect! If you know Golden Deli in Los Angeles, this place is very similar. 
We've made friends with the owners son since we've started going here for our pho. He's super awesome and has been giving us great service since day one. Food comes out hot and fast. This is our AZ pho spot."}
{"text":"Delicious and to the point! My date and I arrived just before they were closing and although they started cleaning up around us, which is usually quite abrasive, they didn't prematurely drop the check. 

The pho was very tasty. I had the well done and rare beef pho which our server suggested, \"I have had a bowl every day for the last thirty years.\" I can now relate after it was promptly delivered to us. FLAVOR-VILLE USA!!! The broth was tasty, beef was delicious, the veggies were fresh, and our server came by and suggested sauces we needed to add for the optimal flavor. He was very helpful and considerate despite his stoic demeanor. Definitely going back sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one since every time I'm there, many of the customers seem to be regulars. When I'm craving pho, Khai Hoan is definitely top of mind. It makes me think of my Mom's home cooked meals and hanging out w/ my loved ones. Although a \"hole in the wall\" in comparison to the many other Vietnamese restaurants in the valley, I enjoy the unpretentious attitude, great service and awesome food."}
{"text":"We usually order the pho thai (rare beef) & egg rolls.  The food here is delicious.  We've tried several pho places since moving to Phoenix from San Diego.  This place is pretty good."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. This is by far the best Pho I have had in all of AZ. The broth is so good that I would come here just for the broth alone. The super everything #1 is what i generally order and it's the best. I love this place and when in Tempe I will come here every time."}
{"text":"The food is really good, the service is always quick and helpful, it gets busy around dinner so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"i'm vietnamese, and my family in the old country was from the north (pho is originally a north vietnamese dish) and lived in the south. Hey this already gets me street cred. WORD.

I'm really a snob when it comes to pho. I rarely rarely ever order it unless i'm real homesick, or craving it like a 512 ( not those roxicets)  cause I am that loyal to the way my parents make it.  I think pho should be eaten without siracha, and without hoison just lime for acid kiddos.   

I thought their pho was pretty good.  Sometimes at restaurants you can taste a lot of MSG in the pho.  Pho needs MSG kids and it's okay it's just soy product don't worry.   But sometimes it gets excessive and it just makes you crazy thirsty and you can just taste it immediately.  Since I don't pour sriracha and hoisin in my pho it also can smell just not as clean.  Ha, I can't think of how to describe this in english ( I swear i'm not a fob).  The portion was a decent size, and a good noodle to meat ratio.  I hate when It's all meat no noodles.  All in all pretty good and fulfilled my craving and didn't just make my homesickness worse like most of the time.  My friend had bun thit nuong cha gio (bbq beef, egg rolls rice noodles)   They have banh hoi too which is cool, I like that better than just bun.  It looked pretty good, he really liked it and they gave you two cha gio (egg rolls) cause lots of places are stingy here in arizona and like to give you one. 


The guy  who owns the place is really nice really friendly guy.   A lot of people in the restaurant seem to be on very good terms with him which is nice.  He reminded me of one of my dad's friend's  I bet he even has a really bad gambling problem too ( ah the curse of the vietnamese) The place is really clean for a vietnamese place.  Vietnamese places aren't know for their cleanliness so a real plus.   Expensive I guess if you base it on Cen Pho's prices but much better food I think."}
{"text":"One of the best pho i ever tasted. The place is a bit far from my place and hard to find- but the drive is all worth it. Mught also want to call them before thinkinh og deiving there- cause one time we drove all the way and yelp says they were open but the time we got there it was close. Try their pho its really good. I recommend the pho and their rolls. 

The pho they make has more aroma and flavor than most vietnamese places i have been. If youre in the area and wants to try something i would suggest this place. The only thing against this place is- their a bit more expensive than the other vietnamese places i have been to!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed vietnamese cuisine over the years. Wanted to take my little sister out for lunch and we were looking for a place not far from the airport. This is a small family restaurant in a shopping complex. We ordered the shrimp spring rolls and my sister loved those. By the way did i tell you this was the first time ever she was trying vietnamese cuisine ? :) She was not too enthu about the Pho(which i love by the way) so we ordered crisp lemon grass chicken with steamed rice. The dish was flavorful and the portion size was good enough for two people to share. I am definitely going to this place again for the Pho.."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! It's so nice to be able to eat here whenever it's chilly outside. Actually, allow me to be honest, I probably would eat here everyday but I settle for 1-2 times a week.

I get my Pho with extra meatballs and no onions and they make it perfect for me each time!!! The folks are awesome and no matter how busy it is everything come out SUPER fast! You know a girl loves to eat in a timely manner with my hectic schedule!

The Springrolls, the crab puffs the chicken fried rice all amazing too! For a good time time and warm feeling after a FANTASTIC meal this is the best come winter or AZ summer time:)"}
{"text":"I recently tried vietnamese food, maybe 3 years ago.  I especially like the pho soup and spring rolls.  Since then, I have been trying every place I can that serves pho.  Out of every place that I have been so far, this place is always the one I come back to.  It's a little hole in the wall type place.  The kind you would drive by and never even notice if you weren't looking for it.  The pho has some of the best tasting broth and is a good portion.  It's about average price if not closer to the cheapest I have found.  It comes with a good sized plate of sprouts, basil, mint, lime, and jalapeno.  The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size.  The peanut sauce that comes with them for dipping tastes almost like fresh made peanut butter and has fresh ground pieces of peanut in it.  The service is fairly quick and very friendly, even with the fact that there is some language barrier.  I was actually taken to this place for the first time by an ex-coworker of mine who is an old vietnamese guy.  He told me himself that this is probably the best place he has found to eat pho at, and based on the fact that it is usually packed with asian people during lunch time, I am very inclined to believe him."}
{"text":"My buddy's brother recommended this place.  We tried it and the Pho was just 'ok' in my book.  Not sure what was wrong with it.  It was Large with tons of noodles but the flavor was a little off.  Might try it again for a second look."}
{"text":"I used to have Pho Pasteur in Boston/Chinatown at least once a week due to its cheap, veggie comfort food. Their red bean and coconut milkshake kept me alive during flu seasons in New England.

Now we are in a new era...or at least new area and I was jonesing for some PHO. My brother found this place and I can't believe how often I drove or rode my bike past this tiny lil complex without realzing Pho was in my vicinity all along. Walking in, its set up like a proper Pho place should be- absolutely NO FRILLS. White walls, simple tables and chairs, tvs on, and ordering counter with pyramids of spring rolls waiting for your take out bag. We got tea and water right away and I spinned around the Lazy Susan-yup, all the sauces and utensils are there. Check. I got the simple veggie Pho and veggie spring rolls with cold soy milk (it can get really hot and the broth means the heat can stay on your lips-soy milk is a good way to counter the effect). Delicious. Nothing crazy, all fresh, no non-sense staff, cheap amazing prices. Quick service and my Pho craving totally sated-this may be my new places I stop on my bike to eat something fast besides the near-by notoriously slow-serviced Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Rated best Vietnamese restaurant in Phoenix in 2014. Food was tasty and hot when served.  Fairly small restaurant which has a capacity of about 50; every seat was filled and there was a wait list. Service is quick but the noisiness prevented the waiter from properly hearing some of our order. The #1 Pho fulfilled its promise with many tasty ingredient; their word was \"everything\" but many was what they delivered. The veggies served with the mini noodle dish were fresh, crunchy and clean. All of the BBQ meats were delicious. I would come again and would recommend to others.

It holds it own compared to what I'm used to in San Francisco; if fact, it's better than some I've had there."}
{"text":"The fried rice is amazing and the Szechuan chicken is my go to dinner. Tastes similar to orange chicken from panda express. My wife gets the pho. Family owned, i love this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty authentic place to go and I would come here again if I was in town and had a Pho hankering. If compared to the places in LA, I would say the flavor of the pho broth is OK, the rice dishes are not as well marinated as the ones I've had in LA. They have all the regular menu items of a Pho place and the service was quick."}
{"text":"\"The pho on Apache is better.\"

That should be the tag line for this restaurant. All of my Asian friends swear that the pho here is better. I had a friend who would walk 1 mile from his apartment to eat here.

I tried the bun and some bowls of pho here. It was great food, but my mind wasn't blown away and I can't tell the difference between the other two pho restaurants by ASU.

The service is good here and the owners are friendly. It's definitely worth 4 stars."}
{"text":"Prior to a few months ago, I had never had pho before. Now this is my go-to pho spot for lunch. The service is always insanely quick and the staff is very polite. Some days it can be super busy, but they always seem to quickly find a spot for me. The portions are large and you receive a separate plate with bean sprouts, basil, jalapeños, limes and other items to add to your pho if you please. My coworker has had a few meat and rice plates off the menu as well. He loved them! I would definitely recommend this place if you like pho!"}
{"text":"I just had a horrible experience there.  I've been to this place a few times before.  Never really impressed but gets the job done.  I just happen to have a hankering for pho since it had just rained.  Rare event and rain causes me to think of comfort food, which pho definitely is up there on my list.  

I come in, sat down, water served and barely glanced at the menu when I sh!t you not, the guy (I think he's also the owner) comes to my table and said something maybe like \"Ready?\" but it sounded more of a grunt.  

I had just happened to look to see that the #7 was what I wanted.  I ordered rare beef pho with meatballs.  He then takes me menu right off my hands.  Um...I was going to take a look at the spring rolls, but ok, I guess I didn't really care for that.  I'll just sit here and sip my water, without a straw, which I would like if someone would come by.  I knew I wasn't coming here for service.  Why is it so rare to have good service in Vietnamese restaurants? It must be a tall order but at least smile dude.  I guess that's what I pay for.  And then a cockroach walked across my table!

Eeew!  I shoo'd it away with my napkin, looked around to see that no one paid attention.  Ok, I won't make a big deal.  I just want to eat and go back to work.  I noticed when I looked around that there was a couple in the corner looking across the room for service waiting for their bill.  They don't know you're supposed to pay at the register, without getting the bill first.  Then 2 guys seat at a table besides me.  They were handed their water and menu almost immediately after sitting down.  hmm prompt service....seconds later dude comes over to grunt.  He just sat them down.  One of the guys looked at the other and chuckles, he wasn't ready to order yet, they just were settling in.  OK it  was not my skewed perception, he really wants us in ready to order.  Then the roach came back around.  I'm done with this place.  yuck. The guy must've eyed them because once the guys put their heads up, boom there he was again, \"ready?\"

My pho came and I ate it quickly, hungry, don't want to think about it.  Pho was so bland and disappointing.  The bowl was small for $7.50.  Upset with the roach more than the horrible service and food.  Went up to register to pay and darted out of there, never to return.  In and out in about 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"Went back here twice more since the first time, and there is definitely something wrong with the pho broth. It smells like French onion soup and tastes like how the dregs of a deep fryer smell. What's going on with their broth recipe?? None of the usual overwhelmingly drool-worthy star anise simmered in a beefy broth.

Very sad... still haven't found a pho place to measure up to the Pho \"Number\" chains back in Colorado."}
{"text":"Went here at 8:30 so about 30 minutes before they closed. My dad order pho Dax biet and my mom and I each ordered two different types of Com Tam (broken rice) dishes. The pho came out a little hotter than room temperature. The bowl should have come out steaming hot. There was barely any meat in the pho. The rice dishes were under whelming as well. The rice was exactly room temperature. The proteins that came with the rice dishes were dry."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Saigon in the East Valley. The food here is good. It's very hidden so you have to somewhat search for it in the corner of all the other restaurants there. I ordered their rice rolls and shrimp. It has lettuce, mint, and I think basil. It was pretty good. The place gets pretty packed around lunch time so try to get there before noon. This place seems like a family business so there's this Asian man that sit by the entrance reading a newspaper and minding his own business, kinda funny. Overall experience very good!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese food. Everything was great. Had spring rolls, pho #2, and crispy chow mien. Friendly service too. I will come back for sure. Ask for recommendations if you are not familiar with Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I have been eating at khai hoan restaurant for over 3 years and it is by far the best pho in the Tempe area. Sonny, the head man over there, makes you feel more than welcome and comfortable.  Every bowl of pho is always consistently amazing in taste and delivered to your table in less than 5 minutes 9 times out of 10. Top notch crab rangoons! Enjoyable lunch cafe style dining. Don't forget to sauce it up baby! (m-swiss style)"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Stevie B - Because I Love You)

I got real hungry so I went to Khai Hoan Restaurant
And I decided to write this review
Just to let them know, exactly the way I feel
To let them know my review's are real.....

Because I love pho, but I'll eat anything
I'll try out some bun gone, some eggrolls too
Because I love pho, don't forget to add the sides
I'll be alright, if you want me to be your guide (to Vietnamese food!)

Khai Hoan Restaurant has replaced one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in the valley!  Pretty bold statement, but this place deserves my love.

I brought the parents here for a meal and ordered some eggrolls to start.  Nice and crunchy with some hotsauce/fishsauce and bam!  It got me rolling.  I, of coursed ordered some Pho while my bro order the Bun Gone-- My Pho was pretty damn good, nice warm pungent broth and tender beef round eyes.  I love adding the sides of basil, bean sprouts, peppers, and lime -- the amount of mix really depends on how I feel that day.  Some of this and some of that; always a surprise to my palate!  The Bun Gone was freshly made since my bro had to wait for it, but boy was it worth it!  Freshly made flat noodles with ground & fried pork, mushrooms, with a side of eggrolls and Cha, a pork sausage.  Overall, one of the best I've tasted around the valley!  Nice soft noodles and the crunch of the eggrolls brought the texture, while the Cha and pork combinations gave this dish a protein punch!  Wow!

The service here is excellent, but the seating is limited so if you come during the dinner or lunch rush don't be surprised to sit next to a stranger or a new friend! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2008. Nice small restaurant with lots of options. I like their pho, spring rolls, and eggs rolls the best."}
{"text":"Vietnamese food is a comfort food for me, especially pho, hot noodle soup really helps me settle my upset tummy. A group of us just skydived and some had queasy  feeling, so I suggested Vietnamese food. A quick Yelp search led me here and everyone in the group was very pleased with their lunch.

I started with iced Thai tea. I thought sweet Thai tea was perfect for my tired body and it was. One person on my table also tried per my recommendation, she liked it as it wasn't too sweet.

Spring rolls was good, good way to start lunch as they are not heavy and give me an opportunity to eat more vegetables. 

Pho dac biet was very good, their hot soup was so comforting for my stomach. I wouldn't say meat portion was generous but seemed they had more noodles than I've had from other restaurants.

They let us pay all individually, I think we all paid by credit cards. Minimum for credit card is $10. We went up to the counter, each declared what we ordered and paid separately for own meal. I appreciate they let us split a check without any issues.

Service was very friendly, relatively close to several major freeway, I would come back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"This place is almost too legit. I'm always getten all the spring rolls n shit. tastey as hell the the peanut sauce. you can just soak it right in there my friend! Plus the noodle soup is gon have you doing backflips right there in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite place for true vegetarian pho (yes, they actually have vegetable broth!) for years. I'll never stop coming in every time I'm in town. The owner and all employees are incredible friendly as well."}
{"text":"If you have tasted San Jose, California Pho, this place is for you! I didn't think I'll find good pho in some place like Arizona but it caught me by surprise.  It's just as comparable to the pho in San Jose California (Land of Vietnamese/pho joints)

Hidden Find:

Pho broth - Tasty and fresh. Noodles are just right and al dente ( a tad bit).  Decently priced $6.25.  Near the ASU campus.

Bathroom - Only if you pass the kitchen area.

Bun Canh - Rice Crepe was good

I was disappointed with the Bun Hoi - The rice vermicelli was a big blob 
rather than neatly pan fried. (- one star)


CLOSED on SUNDAYS

CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"It's a nice hole-in-the-wall restaurant. I had actually missed it the first time going down Apache but saw it in a small plaza the second time around. 

To put it simple: The food is good and plentiful, prices are quite reasonable, service is fast and flawless. I placed a order and within minutes my order was coming out. 

The only qualm I have is the parking but for most, that will not be an issue."}
{"text":"I like the food. The restaurant? Not so much . The restroom is dirty and that gets my apatite. They should clean it."}
{"text":"some how they still can do Pho Bac (north Vietnamese style noodles soup) that i love, the couple very friendly, i always feel at home when i come here ! when i have PHO, i like to have mung bean (Vigna radiata), green onions, basil, hot chili sauce ( Pho is good for hangover) and I'm from north Viet Nam, so after i finish my noodles i always ask for a bowl of rices to eat with the soup left, man ! i bet yea, you will full your stomach. and if you are not Vietnamese, i suggest you try a real Vietnamese egg rolls, wow ! yummy ! hint : they have very good Pho Ap Chao (pan-fried rice noodles) as i know"}
{"text":"I went to Khai Hoan yesterday and ordered the rare beef pho.  Now, this is the first time I have had pho before and I would say it is much like a glorified bowl of Ramen Noodles.  That said, it was good.  To me, not great, just good.  We got the combination appetizer plate.  The spring roll was amazing.  The crab was great.  I didn't like the \"egg roll\" as much as I thought I would, but it was definitely fresh.  I had fresh coconut juice to drink and it was delightful.  I would go back again for sure, but I would be ordering something other than the pho."}
{"text":"When I attended to ASU, I often visited here.
I like there rice porridge, Egg noodles, and many other rice combination plate.
Not too expensive, Tasty, fresh vegis... I would love to come back here again and again."}
{"text":"It's a very small restaurant, but do not be quick to judge, the food and service is AMAZING. Did I mention fast as well ? When my boyfriend and I arrived, the restaurant was almost full, but we were still attended within a minute. The food was served to us by one of the chefs and he was very respectful and kind to us! Their pho is A+ for me and their orange chicken!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho with great taste in a smaller than usual bowl size. Might just just be as good as Dragonfly (Mesa) and Pho Ao Sen (Mesa) for taste, but their bigger bowls gives them an edge. It is ranked #1 ahead of Cyclo (Chandler) for food by the Arizona Republic and interestingly enough, the young Man who runs it is the Nephew of Justina the Owner at Cyclo. GREAT PHO! Okay Springrolls."}
{"text":"I admire the family that owns this joint! Hands down, the best pho broth in the valley. The service is great and you can be in and out of there very quickly, if needed.  The pho to-go is packed both car & consumer friendly!"}
{"text":"Good Pho, but paying almost 10 dollars for a large pho in AZ is ridiculous.  Pho is cheaper in Hawaii and Hawaii is expensive."}
{"text":"This is the best pho joint i've found since moving out to Phoenix. Good portions, reasonable prices and great selection."}
{"text":"Khai Hoan could open their doors in Seattle (pho on every corner) and still have a good following.  Salty, fatty, perfectly flavored broth. Even in the dead of summer, I'll get a bowl of pho here."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Pho place around!"}
{"text":"While in the Phoenix area on business. I was in the mood for Vietnamese cuisine.  Yelp pointed me towards this restaurant.

Located close to Arizona State University.  The place is clean and they serve Chinese food as well. I only ordered the spring rolls (referred as summer rolls in other places) and the large bowl of beef pho, or as they call it \"The #1 super everything\"

Portion sizes are huge! I had a lot of pho in my bowl, my only problem was the the taste of the broth was very bland. The broth was a little underseaoned for my taste.

The spring rolls were a bit of a disappointment.  The seam or edge where they met when they closed the roll was hard. I shouldn't hear the crunch coming from the spring roll skin while biting down.

Overall, not a terrible place. If you're hungry and want to stuff yourself with food, in this regard this place will not disappoint.  If you're looking for more taste and flavor,  you might want to look elsewhere. 

I will need to try the other dishes when I'm back next time. Maybe then I can give them a better rating"}
{"text":"Favorite Pho in the phoenix area so far.  
Great, tender meat in my pho chin nam (#8).
I see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so I'll have to try that sometime soon.    
Nom nom.

Friendly staff.

See ya there!"}
{"text":"Really yummy, no frills Vietnamese. I had the veggie spring rolls and the vegetarian pho - both were delicious. The spring rolls tasted very fresh and came with a peanut sauce and the pho was generous on the noodles and came with your standard fare - broccoli, carrots, bok choy, tofu, and beansprouts and basil on the side. Could have used more tofu, IMO, but that's my only main complaint.

Go up to the cashier to pay, $10 minimum and they do not take American Express."}
{"text":"An out and out gem - the quality and the portions at this place blow my mind, making Khai Hoan stand out as a true Vietnamese gem in the valley.  For me, happiness at a Vietnamese restaurant is a big old glass of young coconut juice with fresh coconut pieces and lots of fresh herbs for whatever I choose to order - whether it's Meatball Pho or Bun with Grilled Pork or even crispy Cha Gio,  give me tons of greenery to use and a sea of nuoc mam for dipping.  This place keeps me beyond happy - the pho comes out piping hot and brimming with rice noodles and meat.  They do not skimp, whereas a lot of other places in the Valley cheap out.  Plus, their broth is fragrant and not greasy, making it a go-to if I've got the sniffles.

I typically come here for lunch and they do a bustling business - folks know that this place gets the job done and they show up.  You shouldn't have a problem getting a table as the service moves quickly.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"I guess I don't get it because I couldn't get over my friend having to use the bathroom in the kitchen! What?! Really?! That can't be right, or sanitary. We stayed anyway because of the great reviews. Wish I hadn't. It just didn't feel clean. The silverware is on the table, just hanging out in a little compartment on the table, probably seeing all kinds of coughing, sneezing, \"kid hands\" fun. I don't get the menu either. What kind of pictures and descriptions are those? I felt sick after I ate there and I am definitely not going back. Please try it if you want. I think the lesson to be learned here is \"to each his/her own\" because people seem to really love this place, so maybe the problem is with me ;("}
{"text":"Spring rolls, egg rolls and Pho are just as good or even better than the best Vietnamese in other cities (San Jose, NYC and Denver, to name a few)...but the building, service and drink offerings are lacking. There's water and juice and...water...
Kinda sucks to waste a nice Date Night outfit on this drab locale. So don't bother. T-shirts and flip-flops abound.
The Lemongrass Chicken isn't quite as spicy as my husband remembered from \"the old days\" but he still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Randomly tried this place for lunch after finding it on Yelp. I called in my order for pickup (definitely use the menu item numbering system when ordering, it was hard to hear/understand the person on the line taking orders) - it was ready for me by the time I picked it up 10 minutes later. The grilled pork rice vermicelli was fantastic! The pork had an amazing flavor and practically melted in my mouth. I will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Finally, a good Vietnamese place in Tempe! It's right down the street from campus, too, which is great. My friend and I had been looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant for a little while, and when we came across this one, we were shocked that we'd never been there before!

The pho soup is great, and although the spring rolls are just a little lacking in flavor, they also are very good. It seems that there are plenty of options here, too, so I definitely want to explore more of the menu. For instance, they have \"rice rolls,\" which are basically stuffed rice crepes. I really do want to come back and try some of those!

Big portions, fast and friendly service, good food, decent price. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Best pho in town, hands down.  Owners work in kitchen and always make sure every dish is prepare to perfection."}
{"text":"The pho here was stellar and great for the price. They offer a big bowl of the pho dac biet called the pho xe lua, which means the train pho (I found it to be very humorous.) The veggies given were all fresh and they even cut off the roots of the bean sprouts which some pho restaurants don't bother with. I'd recommend this place if you want something around Tempe and decent!"}
{"text":"Tried it because of yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. The pho was amazing! Recommended!!"}
{"text":"Holy hell the Pho here is good. I've had better and more unique recipes, but this place does a traditional Pho like no where else in the valley. Did I mention this place is cheap as well? You get a HEAPING portion of everything it contains (I usually just get beef and the Pho \"staples\"). Make sure to get a portion of fried rice to take home with you to use in something that you make. 

They have a TV in here, and it's usually on a sporting event. Whoever controls it watches a fair amount of soccer as well. 

The one star you see missing from this review is because of the service. I get that they don't speak much English but the employees and sometimes the customers \"stare\" at you. 

Also, come hungry. The food comes out lightning quick here, so it would be a great place to get things to-go for lunch."}
{"text":"Tried this place this morning and the worst Pho I've ever had, doesn't taste good at all. And Bun Cha Ha Noi too, the meat was cold and too salty. I will never come back."}
{"text":"We went here after reading so many great reviews.  The place seemed dirty. I went to the ladies room and had to cross through the kitchen.  They were microwaving food.  The pho was ok.  Ive had way better. The entire meal was mediocre at best!"}
{"text":"I swore I order teriyaki chicken, not teriyaki rat meat.  Two words for their Chinese menu, Gar and Bage, yall should take it from me, I'm as Asian as they get, haha I know I know, I can speak engrish wheel well."}
{"text":"Moved to Tempe from San Diego about 5 months ago. I've only been to a few Pho restaurants out here and this is my favorite. Food was great as well as the service. Shrimp Spring Roles are the best; especially with the peanut sauce. 
Prefect for them rainy day blues."}
{"text":"BEST. PHO. IN. THE. VALLEY.

HIGH QUALITY PHO.
HUGE PORTIONS.
ACTUAL VIETNAMESE FAMILY MAKING THE FOOD.

The aforementioned points are very important for me. As someone who ranks pho as probably one of my most favorite foods in the world, I take pho restaurant critiquing very seriously.

Broth: 5 Stars
- How do you tell if a pho restaurant is good from the get go? You order it. They bring it to your table. Get your spoon... and taste the broth. This is where the love and care shows, people! This place has some legit broth and it shows that they actually care for the food they are making.

Vegetables: 5 Stars
 - Some places have nasty wilted bean sprouts... but at this place the veggies are always fresh. Good assortment of what's available: basil, bean sprouts, lime, jalapenos and some sort of cabbage-like leaf that has a great peppery taste.

Spring Rolls: 5 Stars
- A lot of places has this pre-made, but this place makes it to order. You can tell because when you bite into it, you can tell the pork was just recently grilled.

The only tough this is they may forget to fill up your water cup just because it's so busy.

As a Seattle native who's in the area for school, I had gone to many other places only to be incredibly disappointed. Back in my hood, pho places are just as numerous as Starbuck's and a good place is hard to find. Coming into this restaurant reminds me of going to some of my favorite places back home... I'll always be a Khai Hoan-er for Life!"}
{"text":"Yum! Spring rolls, French coffee or fresh squeezed Lemonade & #15 Seafood & Pork Hu Tieu."}
{"text":"This place is ok if you are in need of pho in the Tempe area. Being from Seattle where the pho is bomb, it is definitely not the best but it is a good bowl of pho. I always get he pho chin (steak pho), nice family opened place and the staff is always attentive."}
{"text":"I am a self proclaimed pho connoisseur and my life goal actually is to try pho in every city, state and country there is. This place is hands down my favorite pho place ever. This is authentic as you can get. Pho broth is on point, the spring rolls are bomb and the service is friendly and super fast! I've finally achieved a life goal and I am now a regular there. They know my order as soon as I walk in the door!"}
{"text":"Not kidding, this could easily been the best pho I've ever eaten, if they just adjusted a few things! I ordered the seafood soup with egg noodles and my sister ordered the beef pho. We also got the Chow Fun, which I was pleasantly surprised since it's a Vietnamese place? The broth for the soups are suburb, great taste! But the contents, such as the roast pork, could use some improvement. The wontons however were amazing! Delicious! I should of just gotten the noodle soup with wontons! I didn't like the thai tea but my niece drank it all. I definitely think this place needs an upgrade as the bathroom(singular) is LITERALLY through the kitchen...awkward! But hey, at least you get to see if the kitchen is clean and make sure the cook is handling your food okay--ha!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. Definitely come here if you want banh coun,  it's super good and it's really well done. You get a lot of food for the price you pay. We ordered an appetizer, 3 drinks, and 3 entrees for about 50 dollars. Definitely will come back for the banh coun. Well done."}
{"text":"One of our old standbys... friendly service, great food and not too pricey.  We always seem to get the spring rolls (Gai co cuan?) and beef with noodle bowls (Bun Bo Nuong) and I love the home-made lemonade"}
{"text":"*Excuse me, angry Californian Vietnamese girl coming through.* I can not believe each order of crappy and dry banh cuon was $10 because I wouldn't even give it to a homeless guy for free. Money isn't a thing for me when the food is good but damn it! I am so pissed off that I've wasted one meal and an appetite on basically jail food. 

Ordered 2 banh cuon togo and the ground pork filling was so dry. Shrimp paste/ cha tom was also dry and flavorless. The banh cuon dac biet only had cha lua? Maybe she heard me wrong. Nuoc mam sucked!!!!!! Didn't even add any chili or provide me with it so I could throw it in myself. And way too much banh (rice cake) ratio vs filling and veggies! Both my dad and I threw most of it away. Perhaps we are spoiled with decent food all of our life? BUT SERIOUSLY it was one of the worst meals I've ever been so unfortunate to come across. This probably ruined banh cuon for me, for freakin good. 

Also, I saw some lady get a cafe sua da (viet coffee) so I followed suit. Instant regret!!!!!!! Oh my god it tasted like powdery mud. 

How dare these people serve customers such crap."}
{"text":"Good spot for pho in a quieter area of Tempe. Prices are fairly standard for AZ (about $1-2 more per item compared to San Diego). 

Egg rolls weren't bad. A little dry for my taste, but good flavor. They're not at all stingy with their vegetables here, and even include cucumber/carrots, which I don't usually see at my pho spots!
My family ordered 2 Pho Xe Lua (#1, \"Everything\" Combo Beef) and 2 Pho Tai Nam Gan (#5, Rare+well done beef & beef tendon). Overall the consensus was pleasantly surprised with quality! They don't give you the largest portion of meat, but it's a solid bowl. The broth is SO flavorful, and didn't seem to be full of MSG like so many of pho experiences. (My family didn't feel alarmingly thirsty after this meal as we often do post-pho). 
The Thai tea was just right and not sickeningly sweet like some places tend to do.

If I'm back in the area, I think I'll be back to Khai Hoan for my pho fix!"}
{"text":"This is a great little hole-in-the wall pho restaurant. I'm pretty picky about my pho, and this place hits the mark! They make an excellent broth and the service is very fast. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I decided to give Khai Hoan a shot before a musical at the Gammage. Thank you fellow Yelpers for directing us to this unassuming little restaurant. 

I had the chicken pho with extra veggies,  but requested it bun style--broth on the side. Call me crazy (the waiter certainly looked at me as such), but I wasn't in the mood to splash pho all over my nice dress...yet I still wanted to try the broth. 

The pho came out piping hot. I was miffed by the absence of fresh basil and sprouts on the side. These essential veggies were fondly missed. 

The chicken was tender but a tad dry.  Broccoli, carrots and bok choi--cooked to perfection.  

I really like that the hoisin sauce has a thicker consistency than most pho restaurants.  It went perfect with Sriracha and lime. 

The entire meal was very reasonable.  Next time I'm trying the spring rolls and some Chinese food."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese place in Tempe. I've been going here for four years and have introduced it to many of my friends, which they all enjoy! The food has always been consistent, meaning that the soup taste fabulous everytime you dine in. I would highly recommend the pho, summer rolls, and eggrolls."}
{"text":"Pound for pound, this is the best phucking pho you will ever have in the Valley. Tender  thinly sliced rare flank with tendons & tripe (they don't skimp on the meats either), with tasty rice noodles, in a rich restorative broth--this pho here is the real deal. Garnished with crispy beans sprouts, fresh basil, peppers, and a Chinese menu for your scared friends & family; there are always friendly folks working, and it can get crowded, but it's quick, healthy, affordable, and easily the best pho within 600 miles. Bomb!"}
{"text":"Located amidst the huge construction for the light rail system, is this little Vietnamese pho house. There is almost no decor and the service is made difficult by the fact the waiter/owner does not seem to speak English well.

But the pho is great. The selection is, as usual for pho, filled with red meat versions of the noodle soup. However, there are a couple great seafood phos, and the garden rolls are excellent. You know you're in the right kind of place when everyone else in the restaurant descends from the same region as the food, and yup, most people here seem to be Vietnamese every time I go.  

An excellent bargain, and perfect for when the weather cools off a bit."}
{"text":"I was so uncertain about Vietnamese food when a friend directed me to this place a couple of years back. I decided to let the owner, who knows my friend, pick out a meal for me! He asked me a few things about what I like to eat, if I wanted the pho or something else-- I chose to have something else because I just wasn't feeling like soup (I know, blasphemy)... He chose one of the Bánh Xèo (crêpe) dishes with beef and veggies on the menu. We ordered what is now my favorite soft, rice noodle spring rolls with peanut sauce and a tasty Thai Iced Tea (Yes, I combined my Asian experience). THEN, my dish arrived with delicious sprouts and tasty marinated beef and veggies galore, all within two layers of amazing rice noodle crepes. It is hard to order anything else now! It was very fresh and came in a large portion, so come hungry! I have since also tried the pho, and it is also scrumptious and gives a lot of bang for the buck to satisfy any hearty appetite. I would recommend this place a thousand times and no one I know has ever knocked it after they tried it. 
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was a hot Friday morning.  I'm used to the San Diego mediterranean climate.  Strangely, I craved pho.  Was I homesick? Ricockulous.  T and I yelped it.  We filtered Kai Hoan out of the yelp masses, and off we went.

I stayed with my staple - a large bowl of #1, the combination special of pho.  I enjoyed it - except I couldn't place it why the broth flavor seemed to start strong and finish less so.   That's not to say, I didn't enjoy it, but it made me wonder.  

T ordered banh cuon, which is like a steamed stuffed crepe.  I've never tried it.  I do know that Chinese versions usually serve a variation of this as part of dim sum.   From my experience, it's usually served at breakfast.  Yummay! 

But T looked at it twice - it was served on a bed of lettuce.  Wet lettuce.  It seemed strange to have it served on wet lettuce. Maybe it was for looks, but she claims the moisture further moistened the banh cuon than needed.   

When I'm home in San Diego, I'll try banh cuon."}
{"text":"The fact that I can walk across the street to this and Haji Baba has made my new house a very happy place. 

Hoan has a diverse menu of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes. I always get the pho tai nam. I should try other things, and will, but the pho here is damn good and super cheap.  The well done beef in the pho is really tasty and tender, and there is tons of it.  

Not dressed up in the least, this place reminds me of many places in Chinatowns of 'larger' cities. The owners seem to be always present, a family operation. 

I asked the dad about the possibility of doing sandwiches and he said they might, if they can figure out a way to get good fresh bread everyday. As much as I would like a good bahn mi across the street, I really don't need the extra 10 lbs. 

Khai Hoan. Consistent. Flavorful. Variety. Simple."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese restaurant is one of my frequent stops in the area. I first discovered this place on Yelp, and since then have tried a variety of items on the menu. The squared-shaped interior is largely dependent on natural lighting. The horizontal layout includes TVs, rows of tables, and a small kitchen in the back. 

For appetizers, I recommend the Goi Guon ($3.95). The spring rolls come with grilled pork, shrimp, rice vermicelli, and peanut sauce. The ingredients were fresh, ranging from the rice wrapper to the contrasting tastes and textures embedded in the middle. For this dish, I often ask for fish sauce on the side. It's a good opener for those who wanted something to hold them over until the main entree. 

The menu consists of Chinese and Vietnamese dishes, but I come here largely for their signature item: Banh Cuon. To me, this is one of the best Banh Cuon I've tasted so far due to the stuffed minced pork and soft fluffy rice crepes. Among the options, I recommend the Banh Cuon Cha Lua ($8.95) that comes with slices of Vietnamese ham, chopped red leaf lettuce, basil, herbs, pickles and fish sauce. I also suggest the Banh Cuon Chao Tom ($9.25) that comes with soft golden fried fish cakes. The combination of fresh and fluffy textures, perfect thickness on the rice crepe, delicious toppings, and fish sauce made this particular menu item a must try for first time goers. 

Their Pho ranges from $7.95-$8.95 per bowl. The lack of depth in the mild-flavored broth was a consistent pattern from each of my visits. Even though the broth couldn't stand on its own, I find ordering those that come with more than one meat item such as Pho Tai Nam Gan ($7.95) and Pho Tai Sach Bo Vien ($7.95) an effective method to circumvent the problem. Their pho also comes cilantro, yellow onions, scallions, bean sprouts, basil jalapeno and lime. The side of veggies is always fresh. I only wished the broth could offer more depth and complexity, especially given the high price they charge on these dishes.

The Bun Thit Gio thit Nuong ($8.95) came with great textures ranging from the grilled pork, bouncy noodles, and fresh veggies. I really enjoyed this dish, but again the prices are simply too high for me to rate this place higher.

Lastly, their Thai Tea with Boba ($3.50) was too sweet with boba that was old and staled. I don't recommend it.

Service was prompt but limited to the extent of taking your order, bringing food to the table, and the bill at the end. Given the strengths and limitations of this place, I'd be very strategic in ordering items that are associated with rice noodle crepes, vermicelli, and quite possibly, the noodle sticks. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their Banh Hoi items."}
{"text":"We were referred to eat here because it was one of my friends favorite places but we were not impressed. My standards for Vietnamese food are quite high because I'm Vietnamese and have had authentic food. The pho didn't have enough meat and the broth wasn't as flavorful. The spring rolls are not traditional, the pork was grilled which some may like.. However again the original spring rolls does not have the pork grilled. The pho bowl price was about $1-$2 higher than the norm."}
{"text":"It was my first time there, i ordered Chicken Pho, Spring Rolls and Iced Chai Tea, the pho plate is huge, i ate probably half, its delicious, warm, savory and it comes with bean sprouts, mint, basil, jalapeño and basil. 

The spring rolls come with a very good peanut dip sauce, staff is very nice and funny. They give you fre water refills, because if you put too much hot sauce in your pho you will need it. Will come again!"}
{"text":"I did some yelp-search for some amazing pho places in the east valley, and really didn't have a ton of options, so I picked this nearby 4 star place. 

Now, as I've said before, I am a pho snob. I just am. I have come to accept it and embrace it. Khai Hoan is somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars for me, and because I'm a generous person, I am delving out a 3 star review.

Pros:
* The service is fast.
* The staff is really friendly
* They offer a bunch of varieties of pho an pack the veggie pho with lots of broccoli and bok

Cons:
* It's not located in the best area of Tempe
* The broth wasn't extremely flavorful (definitely beef based)
* You get a small portion for the price of the pho. $7.50 for what would be considered a small bowl of ho anywhere else I have been.

Ok, last thing, which was really, really...odd...the bathroom is located behind the kitchen. Wait, let me rephrase, through the kitchen, then behind the kitchen. Wait, let me try that again...you have to walk through the kitchen while the cooks are back there cutting up fish and other random food items in order to reach the bathroom. It feels...well...unsanitary and quite awkward to traipse through the tiny kitchen, trying to avoid running into the person with the huge knife, while food is being prepared. See? Odd, right?"}
{"text":"FOOD: 
With both a Vietnamese menu and a Chinese menu, it's hard not to find something you're into. The meat is flavored well and the noodles and rice are consistently tasty. It's just as good as any average authentic Chinese restaurant, and the prices are great (especially the lunch menu!).  

SERVICE/ENVIRONMENT:
The service is quick, very friendly, and accommodating. The dining room is small as it is located on the butt of a strip mall, but overall it is not dingy."}
{"text":"Visited some family in AZ who are pho fans.  They took us here to try it out.  

Spring rolls...good, they used bbq pork instead of the traditional steamed
Pho...pretty good, a little bland so I added fish sauce

I just don't know how people eat pho when it's 110 degrees outside. LOL. 

Consistent pho restaurant service...fairly quick, checked on us once, and no water refills (just like in Denver :-)"}
{"text":"I came here with my family and I was excited to see a more authentic option. I ordered their summer and spring rolls. They call their spring rolls egg rolls, but they are basically the same thing. I also ordered their Thai tea. It's not super sweet, but it's still very delicious. Then for my main course  I order their number 2. It's their pho with all of the fixings. The broth was refreshing and the portion size was good. I wasn't even able to finish my whole bowl. 

The service was very professional and friendly."}
{"text":"Boy do I love Pho! But not just Pho, goooood Pho! Khai Hoan is the best Pho in the valley, hands down. It is better than all of the Pho I have found in LA as well. There broth is extremely flavorful. The meat is great quality, and the rare beef is always brought out freshly placed in the bowl so that it doesn't get over-cooked.  The rice dishes are also very good. 

Sonny, the owner, is an amazing guy, and the restaurant is a truly family owned and operated business.

Also, I recommend checking out their 'sister' restaurant, Cyclo in Chandler. It is a very kitchy space with modern furnishings and bright, bold colors."}
{"text":"Usually very busy and popular here, so my experience has been one of the few that have been subpar. The pho is a hit or miss depending on what day and what time you go. The service is a bit rude and not exactly accommodating or inviting. What really made me question whether I want to come back or not was the shrimp I ordered. It was just basic fried shrimp covered in sauce, but they didn't take out any of the black vein or whatever it's called in the lining of the shrimp. Needless to say, we didn't finish our food."}
{"text":"Well Hello Khai Hoan!
You've been there all along and I never knew!
Great Pho and spring rolls, pretty standard decor...no music.  Don't go for a first date, but go for your second, third, and fourth!
Try the Pho with rare and well done beef...YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and it's one of my Favorite pho spots in Tempe. They always have very good customer service and all the servers are friendly and welcoming to everyone who steps foot in the restaurant.

I was thought it was interesting how they had an arrangement of Asian food on the menu; it's not only limited to Vietnamese food which I think is interesting for large groups. I've only been here for pho, but they never disappoint! I usually get the #10 which is the seafood pho and it includes shrimp and imitation crab and lots of noodles! 

This has been my spot since I moved to Tempe 2 years ago and ever since I've hooked my boyfriend on this place too so I definitely recommend! The only downside would be the location of the bathroom; you have to go through the kitchen and the staff glares a you a little it. Seems strange to have a public restroom there, but it's a small establishment so understandably there is little space. Hopefully it'll change in the future but I'll still be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Great family owned Vietnamese restaurant! The spring rolls and the classic Pho dish are my fave! Gets real busy a couple hours before close, but lunchtime is pretty chill."}
{"text":"Ohh the pho!! Best place in and around town to get some great pho. I have been coming here for years and it has never disappointed. They also have great Asian dishes like sweet and sour and orange chicken. A+"}
{"text":"I have had some of the best pho in the southwest. Some of the best being located in Denver and Little Saigon in LA. I went into the meal expecting big things but I was sadly disappointed. 

The meal started off strong with good service and a friendly wait staff but took a turn for the worse as I got an opportunity to try the food. I ordered a bowl of steak pho and egg rolls which didn't take long. 

The egg rolls were bland and after they delivered the food a saw a baby cockroach climb from under the plate. I knocked it off the table and stomped it on the ground. I got kinda queasy after this and didn't want to eat the soup but I powered through. The soup was big and had a lot of noodles but it lacked flavor even after the addition of the Thai basil, bean sprouts, fish sauce, Sirracha, and chili paste.

As I went to the front to pay I saw another baby roach on the wall. All in all 4 egg rolls and 1 bowl of pho and it totaled $17.98 which is way entirely to expensive for Vietnamese food. 

I will not come back here ever again."}
{"text":"awesome small family owned business serving excellent authentic food with excellent service!  the broth is made from scratch and delicious."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pho spot in Tempe! My boyfriend and I frequent here often and although we've never gotten anything off the menu aside from the pho and spring rolls, everything we order is always consistent and delicious. They have a pretty extensive menu that includes both Vietnamese and Chinese foods, but their pho is what keeps us coming back. Their prices are also extremely reasonable for the portion sizes.

The service is quick and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We've been doing takeout a lot recently, but the food is always just as good. We've tried a few different pho places in the area, but none seem to match up or compare to here! It's a pretty small restaurant that gets packed during mealtimes so you might have to wait a few minutes, but because of how quick the service is, you likely won't be waiting very long at all. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a quick bowl of high quality pho!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a quality Pho and was recommended this place from a trusted friend who knows his food. Very pleased that I followed his recommendation and encountered this hidden gem. I had the iced coffee, appetizer sampler, and steak pho. All were excellent and I will definitely be back. Cheers all around."}
{"text":"Ordered Beef Pho. I probably shouldn't have added the basil. Maybe the broth was too basic. I'll have to try this place again as well."}
{"text":"Excellent soup and vermicelli bowl #19. Plenty of food at very reasonable prices. Definitely would go back. The service was quick."}
{"text":"Pretty good if a bit odd. 

My take away Pho was rather a bunch of different bowls and baggies full of various stuff to build your own Pho. Cool in an odd way, perhaps?

Also, i got wrong Pho - seafood vs. chicken. Kind of not the biggest deal ever but never then less."}
{"text":"Best PHO in Arizona!! Amazing spring rolls as we'll. please take the time to try this place:)"}
{"text":"There seems to be a lot of vietnamese places in the Phoenix area. I've tried more than 30.  This place is by far the tastiest.  It's not just the Pho but also the other items on the menu are equally tasty, I like the diversity on the menu and have taken out of town friends from New York and San Francisco to come here to eat and no one ever complains."}
{"text":"My first Pho experience in the Valley, and it was very good! When I first walked in, I noticed that all of the patrons were Asian--this in encouraging! Service was spot on and fast. Good amount of chicken in my pho, which comes with a side plate of fresh basil, sprouts, and a wedge of lime. Nice, savory broth and a large portion for around $9. 

The man who was taking the orders and running the food seemed like the owner? I look forward to taking my wife here and trying other dishes; the other diner's plates looked lovely."}
{"text":"Decided to update my 2010 review!

Mom and I enjoy pho very much, but she can't remember dining here all those many years ago, so I suggested we return.  I made my requisite phone call and asked:

1.  Do you serve egg noodles, and may I get these rather than rice noodles in my pho?  Yes, and yes.

2.  Do you offer both seafood and beef broths/stocks as pho options?  He said they offer both chicken and beef and added that most places only serve beef.

3.  Do you use MSG in pho items?  Yes, as do \"most places.\"

Mom ordered the \"#1,\" which was a combo of meatball, steak, and tendon, though \"not much 'laman',\"  meaning that the meat ingredients were sparse in her opinion.  She really enjoyed the soup, though, and, it looked to me, a lot of rice noodles.  Her request for an extra plate of bean sprouts, lime wedge, and mint leaves was met with a gracious smile and prompt execution!  

I decided to skip pho due to the MSG involved and instead ordered the beef lo mein, and chose to add side plates of steamed rice, crab puff, one fried shrimp, and pork egg roll for $1.50.   (Intention was to have mom give these to my aunt during her visit, but Mom just asked me to take leftovers home.)  The beef lo mein was delicious, but I am almost positive that it contained MSG, as well.  If I were to order this dish again, I would request extra veggies added, such as snap peas, or broccoli, because I can't eat the julienned carrots included-- I want more veggies!

Also ordered Vietnamesfe coffee.  It's basically a shot (perhaps a very concentrated double-shot?) over condensed milk.  Swish it around a bit and then pour over ice.  $3.25 plus tax.  Delicious, but may I suggest offering this beverage in two sizes, our perhaps serve the original size in a smaller glass?  I had about two small sips before transferring the rest into a to-go glass (super-concentrated creamed coffee!) and well, you can imagine what my mom thought when she saw how little space the remaining liquid occupied...  I plan on adding more ice when I drink the leftover coffee at home.

KH offers Styrofoam for takeout and leftover packaging.  I try to avoid supporting Styrofoam pollution."}
{"text":"best pho place ever! my boyfriend and I got the #1 and #2 pho and it was sooooooo good!! there was so much pho for such a great price that we had leftovers! we also had some spring rolls and my only complaint was that I wish there was MORE SPRING ROLLS for the appetizer but other than that the food was amazing!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, Seann C. reviewed this place and now I need to get in on the action.

THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!

I grew up in Northern Virginia (Fairfax) which has a HUGE asian population, and when the city weather sucks 6/12 months, Pho is there to rescue you.

Pho is pronounced \"fuh\"... Like do, re, mi FA, so, la, ti, do. Please fix yourselves.  : ) 

Now I'm in Arizona and I STILL crave Pho like nobody's business and then I heard about Khai Hoan.  Actually, this was my boyfriends first Yelp find and we love it. 

My favorite is the summer rolls, and raw and cooked brisket Pho.

The summer rolls are better back east, but I'll take what I can get.  Also, the peanut sauce has chunks of peanut in it.  I don't care but some people like smooth peanut butter instead of chunky... Catch my drift?

The Pho is amazing.  It's exactly the way it is back in DC/VA. But... I have a secret... 

I KNOW WHY!!!

The owner is from Arlington, Virginia!!! He's legit.  Not that he wouldn't be anyway as he is Vietnamese.  But there is a certain amount of street cred you attain when you're from Arlington.  Clearly... His Pho shows.  

BEST PHO IN PHOENIX, HANDS DOWN!"}
{"text":"meh, I ordered the special combo heiu teiu glass noodles. it was a 2 start but ill give them 3star... not real heiu teiu... cooked in pho soup and thrown in a 1 shrimp, 2 imitation crab meat,  4 slices of pork, and a bunch of bean sprouts. 

The owner guy wasn't that nice either.  he told me to wait like a was a kid when I had a question for him.  

you try to support Viet ppl n business,  but really dude.  

I didn't try anything else... perhaps their pho is good cuz that what everyone was ordering, but I won't be back to try it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch and dinner.  I love Vietnamese food so it is hard to say anything bad.

I like their fresh spring roll and the pho hits the spot.  The food seems fresher and less greasy here.

Prices seem fair compared to the others in Tempe."}
{"text":"Background - I'm from Cali.. so im sorta a viet food snob, meaning I know what good viet food taste like. This place was average, nothing great.. They did put a slice of lime in the water which was nice. Other than that blah..."}
{"text":"Great little Vietnamese restaurant serving pho, noodle dishes, and rice and meat dishes.  We tried several different dishes and some seafood pho.  While I appreciate that they had the seafood pho, the flavor wasn't as good as other pho I've had in the past.  The lemongrass chicken was probably my favorite dish here.  Cooked perfectly, and filled with lemongrass flavor in each bite.  I will definitely be coming here again to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"This was the spot that me and my Biochemistry buddies would go to for our monthly post-exam meal. We would come, sit down and devour all that is needed to drown the pain, the pain of Biochem. 

Food = spectacular, everything is really good, from the pho to the orange chicken."}
{"text":"If your looking for good Phô don't look any further. By far this is the best we have had. The service is quick and they never disappoint. We love the spring rolls, but with the fish sauce. Don't forget to get a coconut too! They cut it on the spot for you. Plus it's a family owned restaurant and which we love."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Vietnamese food before, this is the place. It's among my favorites for lunch and service is fast. They set a high standard for others.  Pho (soup) is the most popular item on the menu and they have the widest variety to choose from."}
{"text":"Really good food. I don't know what I ate but the jalapeño soup was excellent. Service was great! Will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese food. Tried their Bun Cha Hanoi and it was lacking a little flavor and the meat was slightly drier than I would liked but more than edible. Liked that they didn't skimp on any of the dishes since the portions were huge! Decent prices for somewhere other than Little Saigon."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! 

I love this place! I am from Seattle and I've been struggling to find a good pho restaurant since moving out here. Khai Hoan reminds me of some of the restaurants I used to go to back home.  I love hole-in-the-wall family restaurants like this one. No fuss, no frills. Just good food and fast service.We were greeted, seated, ordered and got our appetizer in 10 minutes. Food was delicious!!! Definitely go here!"}
{"text":"I come to eat here at LEAST once a week. My usual order is the P1 with the steak on the side. The employees are all really friendly, and the food is amazing. I've introduced my family and friends to this restaurant and they all love it as well. A MUST go if you love Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Khai Hoan Restaurant, new try for me. Very typical Asian \"hole in the wall restuarant\".  I read some of the yelp reviews, looking forward to a good bowl of Pho, though I have to admit I was apprehensive reading about the \"bug\" sightings. We went for lunch, was greeted and seated right away, service was very good.

We started off with the Goi Cuon (spring rolls with shrimp, grilled pork, rice vermicelli and peanut sauce) which were yummy. We ordered the #4 Pho Tai Man (rare beef, well done beef and rice noodle soup) and the #6 Pho Tai Sach Bo Vien (rare beef, tripe, beef balls and rice noodle soup). The Pho was very good, served with fresh basil, sprouts, jalapenos and limes. 

All in all, good service, good Pho and no sighting of creepy crawlers. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Over the years, I've been dragged from one pho place to the next by pretty much every single friend of mine and despite not being a fan of pho (even though everyone thinks I should be, being Asian and all), I feel like I can weigh in to say this place beats out the competition, hands-down.

Prices here are probably on par with other places but you most definitely get your money's worth, especially with the #1 (or Pho Xe Lua, so the online menu tells me) .  The broth isn't too sweet or too salty (this is starting to read like Goldilocks) and the portion sizes are good enough to satisfy me and all the bottomless pits I fondly call, my friends.  I've personally never had anything other than the pho here, but I've heard that #13 is pretty good, and the kung pao chicken was ordinary.  Though I'd never order kung pao chicken unless I was beaten and tortured into submission to eat at Panda Express.  The owner is also really friendly and always takes the time to talk to my boyfriend because he and his ex-roommates used to frequent the place 2-3 times a week.

Quick note, if you're planning on splitting the bill, bring some cash along cause there's a $10 minimum to use your card.  Or just add-on an iced coffee or if you're adventurous, the salted plum juice!"}
{"text":"I stop here every time I'm in Phoenix- seafood pho never disappoints. And they brew iced coffee in the traditional way at your table. You don't come here for ambiance but the food will bring you back!"}
{"text":"\"Hands down dopest dope I've ever smoked!!!\"

No but really, this place is amazing! It's the my family's go to spot for pho, we won't go any other place. We drive from Far East valley for this place and have been for the past 7+ years, the food, service, and over all experience is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place for 10 years. Never been disappointed. The owner Sunny is a very nice guy. He makes sure every single customers satisfied. 
Food is always great here! If you're looking for some real Vietnamese pho, come here! :)"}
{"text":"I always order the bun, each one I get is always delicious! I've been coming to this restaurant for 6 years and never has their quality wavered. Their fresh rolls are really big and come with a great peanut sauce. The pho is delicious. Give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"I went to this place specifically because of its reviews. I am going to make this short and sweet. It was good but I wasn't falling over myself amazed. I did not hate but I did not love it.

Between the two of us we decided that it has to be the most authentic Vietnamese food in Tempe. The Pho soup was good but it really needed more meat in order to satisfy. I like really chunky, chock full of whatever kind of soup and I just felt this needed a little extra. The taste, however, was great. Unique in and of itself.

If you are super craving Vietnamese I would recommend going here. 

I really don't have a complaint but I really don't have a rave either, I was just meh on it."}
{"text":"Amazing Pho, super friendly, attentive staff and clean restaurant! My mom and I decided to try and new Pho restaurant and it did not disappoint! If you like Pho, you will LOVE this place just as we did! I would highly recommend this restaurant and will be returning frequently!"}
{"text":"Great place for Vietnamese food in Tempe!

If you're in Tempe, and you're looking for a good spot to get Vietnamese food, this is probably the place to go. 

It's a small hole in the wall looking place but serves pretty authentic and good tasting Vietnamese food. Currently didn't try the pho, but judging from other people's bowls, it looked pretty good and the portions seemed huge. The prices are a little higher from what I saw $10 vs $8 at other places in Mesa or in Chandler. 

I would definitely recommend the bahn cuon, which is a minced meat dish wrapped in a rice noodle. Pretty tasty especially with the fish sauce. Might not be for first-timers or for people who are not used to Asian foods. 

I also got pho ap chao, which is a crispy noodle deep fried, then doused with a noodle sauce with meat and veggies. Pretty good! 

I would definitely recommend this place in you're in Tempe. I will definitely come again to try the pho."}
{"text":"Best pho in the east valley, and best egg rolls/spring rolls in Arizona. Been coming to this place for years and have found it to be very consistent. Lettuce and herbs are really fresh (those served with pho and egg rolls) though sometimes they skimp on the mint. Bring your own bottle of water!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Vietnamese food we've found in metro Phoenix.  Enormous bowls of delicious pho, served quickly with friendly and efficient service.  Our \"go to\" place for pho now.  Cheap too!"}
{"text":"They have really good quality pho.  The broth is amazing and not too salty like most places we've been to.  The meat is not rough and chewy , if you get the rare beef on the side so it doesn't cook too much in the broth it will turn out very tender.  They also have something called banh cuon which is a pork/meat wrapped in rice paper... as a California native like I always mention, I have had my fair share of good pho and vietnamese food.. they have REALLY good banh cuon!

Great place for pho and banh cuon.. I have yet to try the rice dishes.  But I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place had some pretty good pho tai. Its just a plain ol' restaurant with a bunch of tables and chairs. Some TVs to watch whatever happens to be on at the time. Seemed to be packed right up until the minute they closed - which we knew that minute was coming when they were putting chairs on the tables around us."}
{"text":"Solid place for pho. Don't be fooled by the seemingly dead strip mall, the place is in here

The cha gio were decent. The wrapper was good, there was something slightly off with the filling. I thought the menu said it came with noodles, but mine did not. The plate for cha gio burritos was great otherwise

The ice coffee was pretty darn good. Nice coffee/milk flavor to it, ice creamy but not overly

The pho was just OK. The broth was missing depth. The beef flavor was there and the hint of lime. I wonder if it was just light on the fish sauce or the other spices. The meat was well sliced, though, and they have white pepper.

There is still better in the city, but I also didn't have the Bahn Cohn (sp) so that could be my issue not theirs"}
{"text":"10 years ago, this place changed my life!!!

I attended ASU and graduated back in 2000.  During my senior year some of my Chinese friends and I (I'm Chinese too) decided to go eat pho @ Khai Hoan.  Up until then, I lived my life pho-less and oriented my dining experiences around a majority of the chain restaurants that are littered around the Phoenix.  I say \"litter\" because a majority of them really are rubbish...  I'll cover those in other Yelp review(s).

So we head over and I first notice that Khai Hoan doesn't have much street appeal and to be honest, before they revamped their interior within this past year, it wasn't that great looking on the inside either... 

But I quickly found out, that doesn't matter ONE BIT.  This place rocks.  I'm no stranger to soup and initially thought this was a variation of a ramen soup meal but I was so wrong.  The broth packed an amount of flavor that would seem impossible to cram into a liquid that was so thin.  The meat was soft and I found myself inhaling the noodles and broth to make up for the nearly 20 years of NEVER HAVING PHO...   

Since then, I've been making up for that injustice.  I've been having pho nearly once a week or sometimes even more often than that and have been going on a spree to convert my friends to being pho-fans.  

:-)"}
{"text":"Ok, we have been going to this restaurant every pay period for the last year, and I am yet to actually sing it's praises on here. I'd like to note that we actually live about 20 minutes from this restaurant, and yet we still make the trek out to it on a regular basis because it's we really really love it.

I always get the Pho Ga (chicken), and my boyfriend gets the large beef pho with everything in it. Out of all of the pho I've had in the valley, the broth and flavors are my favorite here. 

I always find the staff to be quite pleasant and nice. Many times it's a full house, but we've NEVER had to wait for a seat despite that, because there's a lot of seating available to accommodate a steady/quick turnaround.  

I of course would recommend this place. In fact, I have a photo of their business card in my phone so I can text it to my friends whenever they are looking for a place to go :) For the record, all of my friends that have gone have also loved it! ;)"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a Saturday night. Everyone wanted some Pho so I pulled out my handy dandy Yelp bookmark and Khai Hoan it was. I trust all my Yelp friends. 

It's a small little place in a strip mall with pretty limited parking. This is one of those Asian mom & pop with just a few tables with nothing really decorated. Pretty bland but we came here for Pho and the food. Everyone says this is the best Pho place.

When you walk in there's really no one to greet you. We looked for a table and they somewhat guided us to the table since we had a party of 6. Menus were given to us and water cups passed out fairly quickly.  

We started off with their egg rolls, shrimp spring rolls, and beef spring rolls. All of the spring rolls were really good but I really liked the shrimp the best. Love the peanut dipping sauce. Nice and fresh. Everything was exactly what I was expecting. The egg rolls were really good. Nice and crispy with lots of filling. Just how I like it. So our appetizers were really good. 

I was going to get the Pho cause everyone said its the best but my wife ordered the Pho I was going to get so I decided to get something else. Was also told the Bun was good. So got the #23 bun tom thit Cha gio. Don't know what that means but it had grilled pork and shrimp with egg roll, little salad, and rice noodles. Really good. You get a nice balance meal with the bun. Fresh and good. Really enjoyed it and gobbled it up. 

My wife got the pho tom Cua which is seafood noodle soup with shrimp and crab. Didn't get a chance to grab a bite but she didn't complain at all. Everyone loved their food and they give out really big portions. I was the only one who finished their meal. Then again I'm a big eater. 

It's not the cleanest place. Typical small Asian restaurant. Their bathroom is in the back. You have to go through the kitchen and you can watch them prepare the dishes. So kitchen seemed pretty clean and surprisingly the bathroom was really clean compared to other Asian mom and pop shops. Not bad at all. 

Service was pretty good. Water cups brought out quickly but we did have to ask for refills. Like I said no real ambiance. Pretty bland but you don't come to these type of places for that. It's all about the food. Very fresh. Very tasty. Really good food and they bring out the food really quickly. So if you're looking for some good Pho, Bun, spring rolls and egg rolls this is the place for you. Man was this good."}
{"text":"Came back again but the noodles in the pho were overcooked this time
The thai tea also had a bad batch of boba

However their gui cuon and the peanut sauce were pretty terrific"}
{"text":"Amazing eggrolls and great flavor pho! Can't go wrong here! Clean, fast service and sooo good!"}
{"text":"The pho is very good.  The broth, with its black licorice-like flavor is really outstanding.  The rare beef and tendon were also excellent (although the tendon wasn't chunked, it was stripped, which was a first).  My Vietnamese pork chop, while very good, didn't seem very Vietnamese (where was the ubiquitous red BBQ?).  I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Based on reviews here on Yelp, my son and I tried Khai Hoan tonight.it had the added benefit of being a short walk from my hotel.

The pho was among the best I've had, with some subtle difference in the spicing of the broth that elevated it well above normal. Service was quick, efficient, friendly, and unobtrusive. 

I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I want to first say I don't come here for the service, I come here for their banh cuon, since it's one of the few places that seems to serve it. The service is \"weird\" for a lack of a better word, you're not really greeted or order confirmed verbally or with any expression. But you're not here for the service you're here for the food. I'm used to my banh coun having the meat being rolled into the rice paper but here they serve it on top. The banh cuon is plated over bean sprouts and lettuce, and the thit nuong is a little thin but the dish itself is still tasty. I would come back for the food!"}
{"text":"Wow, I had the number one, large pho with everything, and I was just really impressed with the flavor and the amount of meat! I've only have one pho in Phoenix to compare to so far and this blew the other out of the water. I don't think pho should have a clear broth, this was cloudy and probably the reason it was very flavorful. And I love thinking I'm finished and all of a sudden a find more meat at the bottom! 

The service was quick too and the food came out soon after we ordered. 

Btw, minimum $10 order to pay with a credit card!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pho I've had thus far in Arizona! Drove from Northern Phoenix and found the food well worth the drive. 

Came in with a couple of gals to have Pho for lunch and came in with big appetites. We decided to start with Egg Rolls (Cha Gio) and Veggie Spring Rolls because we were super hungry and we had a Vegan with us. For the main entree, I opted for my personal favorite: Pho Tai, simple bowl of Pho with thin raw slices of beef and typically topped with onions and/or green onions.

The Egg Rolls came out fresh and piping hot, filled with Wood Ear mushroom, meat and a bit of veg and served with dipping sauce. These also come out with a few cucumbers, perilla and lettuce to eat with the Egg Rolls. Two thumbs up for scalding hot egg rolls, delicious in flavor and pretty big in size.

Pho Tai came out in a small sized bowl, but filled with noodles, a beautiful brown broth, slices of thin beef and sliced green onions. Don't be fooled by the small bowl, it holds a good amount of noodles and broth nearly at the brim. The broth was absolutely delicious and as close in flavor to the Pho I was raised on and can be found in the Bay Area. Good balance or savory, sweet and aromatic. The pieces of beef were actually really tender and soft to eat, I've found that some places provide really tough slices of beef which ruins the eating experience. Another good sign here is the freshness and abundance of greens served along side your Pho. Here they serve a good amount of bean sprouts, lime, jalapeno, mint and Thai basil. So go right ahead and pile what you want in your Pho and I don't care who says it, go ahead and add Hoisin and Sriracha to your soup. You're the one eating it!

Service here is expected from most Vietnamese establishments, pretty casual and informal. It's not uncommon to see owners, staff members or family having their lunch at tables in plain sight or on their phone. Though it's the type of environment that's not found in corporate or chain restaurants, these mom and pop shops serve up what's real. The man serving us was great, he took our orders, refilled waters and was always an earshot away if we needed anything. Definitely, would come back. Don't judge this place by it's decor or casual service style, these bowls of soup are amazing! Came in hungry and practically had to roll out and with take out boxes!"}
{"text":"Needed some fresh and authentic Vietnamese while in Phoenix. Had the Pho w/extra veggies. Spring Rolls were also delicious."}
{"text":"I am no Pho expert, but do try to satisfy my cravings once a week. Been to countless Pho places in different states, north/south Cal, Arz, Houston, Dallas, OKC, FL, Pho here is average, a little on the salty side and heavy on MSG. Customer service is also average, after my order was taken no other words came from any one there, not even \"thank you, see you again\" after I pay for my meal at the counter. Cafe sua da is below average, bland, almost no flavor. Gave 3 stars because there are worst Vietnamese \"Pho\" restaurants out there, much worst."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out during my lunch break. Called in my order ahead of time. Walked right in and the lady asked if I called earlier and I said yes. My order was ready and didn't even wait a single minute to get my Pho, it was so good that I wanted more.  I would recommend this place to anyone that's in the Tempe area. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Vietnamese restaurant of my life time. Yes, its a pretty damn GRAND introduction.  I live in Southern California but I make excuses to visit Arizona just to dine here. Everything is top notch from quality of the food to family oriented welcoming service here. Oh and of course pretty much EVERYTHING on their menu is epic. I have my normal \"Four items\" here which are
*Spring rolls
*Crab puffs
*Vietnamese ice coffee
*Pho 

Back in my AZ days I used to dine here lunch & dinner and me and my friends never got tired of this place EVER.

I have friend from Dubai that is dying to go back.

Nuff said."}
{"text":"Going to have to proclaim this my go-to after trying it. Ordered the #1 (super beef - has everything) and took it to-go with a couple of tips from the cashier on how to best serve at home and it turned out awesome. Fresh veges as always, and some tasty rice and meat to go with a bunch of delicious broth just about sums it up."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the Valley. The family that owns it is very nice too. Get the Pho combo! Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This had been one of my go to places to eat for close to twenty years! 
Best Pho in the valley! Tasty and fresh everytime! The menu has many safe and recognizable Vietnamese and Chinese items... Plus there are the adventurous Vietnamese items that take you to another place filled with yummy treats.
I love this place... And it's family owned. Yep they are all there everyday!"}
{"text":"I usually eat Pho when I go to a Vietnamese restaurant and maybe I should have. The Com Tam Dac Biet was odd. The rice, shredded pork, grilled meat, pickled veggies were good; however, there was a weird looking patty meat, tasted good I guess, but I was just confused because I never had that on my Com Tam before. Also, the steamed egg was weird: it was super dry, yellow and gray in color, looked like a dry eraser. My friend said the Pho Ga was good. My other friend ordered broccoli and beef and it was a big portion (awesome), but it came out with like a yellow fried rice (he couldn't even explain it). We all ordered spring rolls, flavor was on point, but the rice paper was a little dry, making it tough to eat. I must commend this place on their great customer service though; they're always there to refill and take away whatever \"trash\" you have. I would go back to try out different items. Not everyday do you see a Vietnamese restaurant serve Banh Cuon, especially in AZ."}
{"text":"Amazing! I had the #18, my friend had the pho both were extremely flavorful! The staff is very friendly and the place is very clean. I recommend this place to anyone and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the #3, rare beef. Great pho, probably some of the best I've had in Phoenix. Also had the spring rolls, which were great. I really like how they use larger pieces of grilled pork rather than the thinly sliced boiled stuff.

Very close to my work, so I'll definitely be back. However, my Phoenix favorite will remain Pho-Tan on 17th Ave. and Camelback."}
{"text":"I moved to AZ a few months ago from NYC, where I lived in a neighborhood of great Vietnamese restaurants, and have eaten my way through the Vietnamese enclaves in Boston and in Hong Kong -- and this place ranks up there with the best of them. You can tell how authentic a Viet place is by the condiments when you order: the right kind of basil, mint leaves, and limes. This place has all that correct, and their fish sauce is perfectly seasoned: not too sweet like some faux-Viet places, and just the correct color/taste. I'm lucky that it's down the block from my new home, and I can run in whenever I want. The pho is right-on, with really tasty and rich broth, and I also love the noodle cakes with grilled beef. 

Only complaint is that I find the price to  be slightly higher than what I'm used to in NYC (of all places!). But it's only about $1-3 off per entree, and I understand it may cost more to get their supplies to the desert."}
{"text":"Finally I found a good pho place around town.  It's not the best I've had but good.  I am a pho fanatic so I know what good pho taste like and not so good pho taste like.  

I just need to ask everyone one question.  Why do people add siracha and hoison in their pho?  Everyone does it and I don't understand.  You ruin the flavor of the broth.  Just a squeeze of lime is perfect.  If you want siracha and hoison, use the little side plates for the meat.

If you want good cheap food here's a place to go."}
{"text":"Went there with my son today. He was thinking back to when he was a freshman at ASU and went there. Food is still great. People are very quick and friendly. It was a good time today, thanks!"}
{"text":"Second time to this place. Their Pho is very good, really fresh raw ingredients on the side, to customize your dish to your liking."}
{"text":"Delicious Pho! Definitely recommend stopping by for lunch or dinner. Veggie springs rolls were good too!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place, the beef spring rolls and number 4 are my favorites. We eat here at least once a week and having tried at least 8 other Vietnamese restaurants in the valley this is our favorite. Great price amazing food and family owned. Good service too."}
{"text":"Best place for pho I have found in the valley. Get the #1 with everything: tripe, tendon, fatty flank, meatballs and the regular beef. Don't let the ingredients intimidate you. It's out of this world good!

If pho is in your future, be forewarned that the serving sizes are massive. I have never been able to polish off an entire bowl. So come extra hungry and skip the tempting spring rolls (also delicious with a killer spicy peanut sauce). Because if you've ever made the mistake of trying to stretch out a bowl of pho by taking half of it home, you know the disappointment that comes along with that cloudy bowl of watered down leftovers. Rice noodles just don't hold up well. Le sigh.

Lately I've taken to phoning in my order and picking up my Pho To Go (someone needs to snatch up that name, stat!) at the same price as the dine in option ($6-8). I have discovered the secret to pho longevity this way. Noodles and beefy parts are packaged separately and the broth is also in its own container. Nothing gets water logged and cloudy and I can easily make four meals out of one order. They toss in all the baggies of goodness too! Bean sprouts, basil, limes, jalapeno and mint in one; cilantro and spring onions in another. Hoisin and sriracha on the side. I seriously get hog wild with these additions. It's like a new bowl every time I try it!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!! The best pho in AZ next to OC. Being an OC native I searched for some comfort food from home and have tried many but this place by far makes the best pho I've had in AZ. Will definitely be back to try other favorite Vietnamese dishes of mine."}
{"text":"A sober Saturday night when all my friends were out drinking led me to this restaurant. 30 minutes on the train and a 5 minute walk and I was here. Upon walking in, I had high hopes. 

Khai Hoan has the typical \"we aren't trying to impress anyone\" Vietnamese restaurant atmosphere. It was filled with a lot of Asian folks speaking their native tongue, unlike a lot of places full of whitey.  The woman who owns the place was very cordial and although her english was somewhat broken, she was tremendously helpful to me. A walk through the kitchen to wash my hands revealed how clean the place has to be kept. Obviously they wouldn't want anyone walking to the restroom and seeing a dirty kitchen. Hopes still high!

My bowl of bun came, #19 ($7.25) with egg rolls and pork, my usual bowl at any Vietnamese restaurant. Usually, the bowl is oversized, giving you room to mix up your ingredients once you put your favorite condiments on it. Unfortunately, the bowl was packed to the brim so I had to make some adjustments on how i eat the dish. As for taste, the overwhelming flavor of barbecue pork dominated everything in the bowl, which was a delicious flavor, but somewhat disappointing that I couldn't taste the sauce.

This restaurant is also in a pretty skeezy neighborhood. I'd forgotten how long it has been since I have encountered your run of the mill trailer park white crack/meth heads in public. They kind of scare me. I'd rather deal with a drunk bum anyday. 

+2 for the service 
-1 for the overwhelming taste of barbecue
-1 for the awful neighborhood"}
{"text":"This one of my favorite spots for good Pho, the prices are very reasonable. I have to say though the place is very clean but also you can see all of the family helping out to cash register and cleaning tables. I had the Pho super bowl and it was amazing, the broth had great flavor without any chili but once you add the rest of the ingredients all the sweet and spicy flavors came to live. A must check out of your in the area of Tempe."}
{"text":"Had my first visit there this afternoon. 

Very good broth in that pho. I had a large bowl of the number one \"everything\" version (complete with tripe). The meat had been cooked long enough to be tender. The spring rolls were good but not that far above average.

Perhaps one of the best indications of a good ethnic restaurant: There were plenty of customers of the ethnicity in question. 

Service was very good. The spring rolls came out almost immediately as an appetizer, which differs from many other places I've been.

So yes, I'll be back."}
{"text":"this is the best thai/pho food around chandler area.....yes the environment are not 5 stars but food is really great...."}
{"text":"Extremely fast and friendly!!

The one thing that sets this place apart from the other pho places is the speed and friendliness.

If you are craving good pho and your body is like, \"Hey, I need pho now, can't wait!\", then this is where you want to go. Once you order, it is in front of you in about 5 minutes, even on a busy sat night.

Not only that, but the owner here is super friendly and always is around for some good conversation."}
{"text":"I have been to my share of Phó places in the Valley but this is one of the best outside of California.  You can always judge a restaurant by it's clientele and this one had a range of ages and ethnicities. When you see an older executive sitting next to a large family of Vietnamese who are sitting next to college kids and business professionals, you know it has to be good.  The shrimp spring roll was good, the Phó was excellent and the Thai tea was okay. I think out of our meal the tea was the only part lacking. I will definitely come back for lunch again!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a bowl of beef pho and it was yummy... I'd give them more stars, but they practice a community type of setting with all silverware in a bucket at each table, and the fork I chose wasn't clean.  I just imagine everyone touching the utensils, not very appealing for me, but to each his own!"}
{"text":"Let me think best spring rolls best egg rolls great pho best people so like the best my all time favorite for Vietnamese"}
{"text":"Great pho and Ban xiau (crispy thin pan cake filled with a combination of sprouts, shrimp and meat). Super yummy and the best part is the Ban xiau comes with 2!"}
{"text":"Amazing, plain and simple.

I don't quite have the experience that my girlfriend does when it comes to Pho (she grew up back east), but this place has the best Pho that I have tasted.  I took my girlfriend here to try it out because I saw the reviews here on yelp and I am glad that I did.  The food we had was amazing and we will definitely be going back for more.  

If you are in the mood for great Vietnamese food, Khai Hoan is the place to go."}
{"text":"Eating here almost made me feel like i was back in the bay area! Upon walking in, i remember my co-workers exclaiming in excitement,
\"There are other ASIANS HERE! WOH! You even pay at the register!\" 

That's authenticity roite thar.

I didn't think that i would be able to find an authentic asian restaurant in the phoenix area but this place proved me wrong. Not the best pho ever, but the best by far that i found in the area."}
{"text":"Oh god. Yes.

The Pho Tai here is pho king incredible.

Best in the pho king Valley."}
{"text":"Is ok. Nothing great here. Just an average Pho experience I would say.

This is a dove in a very divy part of town. Luckily the company I had was amazing and makes any meal great.

Side note: the opposite side of the same shopping center had the best Chicken Shwarma in town. Haji Baba. That place is bomb."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service, plentiful portions, and great flavor! I was served the best Thai tea I have had. A recommendation sent me here with a guest and we had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! So fresh and delicious, the only bad thing I can think of is they are busy, which is a good thing because their food is amazing! Their spring roll is literally the best spring roll I have ever had only to be followed by many more! Oh one more thing, their peanut sauce... If I could get that in a bottle to use at home that would be one step closer to heaven!"}
{"text":"The Pho is to die for! This is my go to place for comfort food, especially on chilly winter evenings. 

The broth is delicious,and, the pho has just the right amount of everything you would dig in for in a bowl of Pho! Don't go if plastic forks, lack of appealing decor or indifferent service bothers you. The Pho makes up for the lack of everything else (for me!), but, that may not be the case with everyone. The rest of you, head to Unphogettable, which also gets a four star, but, that rating relies on factors other than just the Pho."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this restaurant a better rating, but it's hard when you see a cockroach on the wall next to your table! Having read many of the reviews, I caught at least 3-4 other reviews saying there were cockroaches either on the wall or on the TABLE (I would DIE if the latter happened to me). 

I understand it's a good place with good food, but I think they need to address this cockroach problem. I wanted to like it and make it my go-to Vietnamese place, but it's hard when I imagine cockroaches in the kitchen too (I just get the feeling that they KNOW they have this problem and they are not doing anything about it).

Also, I did not really like that the utensils were all hanging out at the table. I wasn't really sure how clean they were after being out there for God knows how long, and being exposed to God knows what!

Now with the food, I am not an expert on pho, but I did enjoy my chicken pho soup! However, I thought many of the chicken pieces were very tough to chew so that was annoying. We also got some yummy spring rolls. 

In summary, I would say 3.5 stars for food, and 1 star for being dirty (I also caught a few yelp comments that complained about dirty lettuce or veggies)."}
{"text":"Very authentic viet cuisine. When you walk in, you know it's good just based on the smells. Service was great and food is still good after all these years."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town PERIOD!!

If you're looking for a great bowl of pho, this is the place to go.  Being Vietnamese myself and growing up on homemade Pho, and also coming from California where pho joints are a dime a dozen.  I know good pho when I taste it and I'm telling you if you live in the Valley, this is where you go to get the best pho in town.  I make pho at home all the time and I still can't perfect the soup the way Khai Hoan has, and that says a lot!  They also have really good Vietnamese egg rolls and spring rolls as well.  I love that Khai hoan offers other Vietnamese specialties like Banh Xeo ( vietnamese savory style crepes with meat and shrimp) and Bun Rieu too.  

This isn't your fancy shmancy kinda place, it's a wear your flip flops and shorts if you want kinda place, just don't come in wearing nothing but your undies cause well, let's be honest, no one wants to see that now do we? -=o)"}
{"text":"Amazing little mom and pop shop that I've never seen devoid of customers and for good reason.  

Hands down the best pho I've ever had out to eat.  Fresh ingredients,  made quickly and oh so good.  Sometimes I dream about it.  

The fresh rolls they make are awesome as well. 

This place is fantastic for vegetarians.  While there are three vegetarian options,  they are never cross contaminated and taste amazing.  Also, the pho is all you need in your dining experience,  just saying.  It's that good. I can't emphasize enough,  try the pho (meat eaters and vegans). 

My boyfriend and I love dining here and we are able to suit both our diets with this menu."}
{"text":"A block or 2 from the main Arizona State campus, DL introduced me to this Vietnamese plaza-embedded eatery, offering the well-known Vietnamese dishes typically found nationwide.

But besides these common goodies, one that I've eaten for the very 1st time was called Banh Cuon, aka Vietnamese Rolled Rice Cake/Crepe.  You're probably thinking of something literally sweet: nope, it's at the polar region, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/khai-hoan-restaurant-tempe?userid=jQYIE9bjrh9EP-B5FXpqPw#4FC85Th0ookwRhbqJ8p1-Q.  Anyway, for DL it was his 2nd visit at Khai Hoan, & because I usually wanted the Pork & Egg Roll Vermicelli Bowl/#19 ($8.95) instead of Pho--the summer temperature further explained--he reordered the Banh Cuon Dac Biet Khai Hoan/#25 ($9.25), or in American terms Khai Hoan's House Rice Crepe.

My bowl was like every yummy Vermicelli Bowl I've devoured: excellently textured & filling meats, copiously bouncy noodles, and fresh veggies.  My major issue is that, based on many Vietnamese eats I've visited other than in CA (whether hole-in-the-wall standards or at popular status), at roughly 9 bucks it's the highest priced Vermicelli Bowl I've ever discovered--more than the cost found at my favorite place to get this hulk, located all the way in Minneapolis.  I looked at the prices of their Pho, too, & I'd rather save it for either in my home state or this local spot near DL's residence.

The next items slightly placed aside this concern.  Our drinks, i.e. our Thai Tea and French Press Iced Coffee, were at consistent value among other competitors U.S.-wide.  Both, to me, were sip-tastic, with the exception of the sub-average tapioca pearls.  As for the saved-for-last Banh Cuon, in spite of the monetary tag, this would be my only reason I would revisit.

The patted rice roll was consistently soft and uniformly thick without being mushy &/or too slippery.  Sandwiched in these rolls was some scrumptious stuffed ground pork.  For better complementary textures, we dove into the exact tastiness and texture of the grilled beef and egg roll, plus some thick very gnaw-friendly pieces of Vietnamese ham.  They were so tasty w/ the Vietnamese fish sauce that we made sure not to allow this platter go to waste, consequently expanding our bellies silly--though I do hope that there's an equally yummy version back in the OC.

Frankly, their prices are comparably steep, especially when you have a pleeeeeethora of Vietnamese restaurants scattered in either Southern Cali or metro Phoenix.  That said, I'd again be returning to this swell Tempe eatery when we both are cravin' for their signature soft & savory crepe.  In math terms: 2.5 stars for the price, 4.5 stars for Banh Cuon, plus 3 stars for everything else average out to 3 mixed stars."}
{"text":"Great prices and big portions with good service and consistent quality! 

Recommendations from locals: Grilled Pork Chop with Broken Rice and Tri-Color Dessert with yellow mung bean, red beans, and green gelatin strips"}
{"text":"The Grilled Beef, Shrimp, & Egg Roll vermicelli was good. A bit too much rice noodles. I ended up throwing half it away...the noodle a bit soggy that what I'm use to but after the sauce it was no biggie. Overall, still pretty good!"}
{"text":"being that i'm fully vietnamese and my mom has made all types vietnamese dishes ever since i was a kid, i have quite the tastebuds for authentic vietnamese food. also, growing up in so cal there are a lot more restaurants to choose from. 

for arizona, this place is probably one of the best authentic vietnamese restaurants in town. i always get their pho ap chao....even the owner knows this when i step foot in the door. :) their pho is really great..the broth is good, the beef is good, the noodles are good. everything is like it should be. their spring rolls are pretty decent. what i really like is it doesn't pretend to be something it's not. it's a hole in the wall place, but most good and REAL vietnamese places are. the food is great and the service is quick."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this little place. The Pho is phenomenal! The broth was light and clean, yet complex and rich. We also ordered some lemon grass beef and that was cooked to perfection. The Thai tea was perfectly balanced and the price is good.
The environment is basic, and the service is somewhat spotty but the food is what makes me come back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Nice to see some variety when it comes to Vietnamese! Doesn't hurt that it's DEEELISH as well. I had number 13 with egg noodles and the appetizer sampler. Nice variety of things in the number 13- wontons, BBQ pork, fish balls, surimi, and shrimp. Quality of BBQ pork and the wontons could improve- but I wasn't mad at it. Soup broth was really nice- drinkable on it's own. The appetizer sampler was great!"}
{"text":"As we ate a huge cockroach crawled out of the spoon/folk dispenser on our table. Staff didn't appear fazed by this, we left our meals mid way and left the restaurant disgusted. We were charged the entire bill regardless of our experience. Interesting."}
{"text":"If you are debating about whether to try this place, Khai Huan will not let you down. The broth in the pho has a savory, comforting flavor, and the different types are all delicious. I had the #16 (sweet wonton), my friend had the #3 (pho tai with very tender beef). Reasonably priced at about $9 a bowl. Nice and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"most authentic Vietnamese restaurant. their pho broth is the best I've ever come across. highly recommended. my go to pho place."}
{"text":"They do not serve fresh Pho noodles.  Sorry, you got to have fresh pho noodles for the soup.  Not the dry kind that has been sitting around for years.  It makes a big differences."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast. This was my first time eating pho and it was superb. Friendly and clean"}
{"text":"A weird hole in the wall family owned vietnamese/chinese place. I really only get pho there with some appatizers but after a few visits this became my favorite restaurant. A nice local casual feel with the best pho Ive ever had. You have to eat here"}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I rarely make it down to ASU to eat since there are so many Vietnamese eatery there.  I have been there many times and they have always been great.  It is a little pricy compared to other Vietnamese venues but they do have Bun Cuon (rare treat that is a must here).  Their Pho were in par with local establishments.  The smile from the chef (older Viet lady) and bus person is great and I have a feeling that the tip went to the young kid who only took the order which it should have belong to the chef and the Mexican bus person who really provided the service.  May be I'll make a point next time to directly tip the person who really served me instead.  The owner said hi since he was doing electrical work, he was busy and couldn't serve me.  I will return whenever I have opportunities to run down there..It is extremely popular with ASU students so you will feel the vibrant energy there..Cool place to be."}
{"text":"This place has been around for many many years. When I go to this Plaza I either come here or go to Haji Baba. I usually get the bun which is the vermicelli noodle with choice of different meats and egg rolls and some vegetables underneath. The beef this time was a little tough but still seasoned nicely. Staff is run by the family which is very helpful. If you're in the neighborhood and you want good Vietnamese you should go and check them out. Plus everything on their menu is around $8 to $10 for nice size portions"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service, and great prices.  The pho is excellent, but frankly everything on the menu is very good.  I've started using it as my lunch meeting place and everyone I've taken there has been hooked!"}
{"text":"The service was impeccable, and the food was really amazing. Large portions and super fast. Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"I've been to Khai Hoan two times now. The first time I got the number 5 and the second time I got the number 15. Both were excellent!

The service is fast, we didn't have to sit at the table for long before someone came over and took our order. Even getting the food didn't take to long. The beef in the number five was perfect, sliced thin and rare when it was put in so that the broth could cook it. 

The broth wasn't overly oily and you get a big plate of 'fixing's (like bean sprouts, lime and basil) for your soup.

Overall, this place was great--though I think the soup needs more meat on average.

I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Very unassuming little restaurant with delicious food. I have never eaten in, but we get take out at lunch a lot (we work close by). They have always been super quick with our order (we don't even have to call ahead) and we have never experienced the unfriendly service that I have read about in some of the other reviews; every time we have been in everyone has been very friendly.

I am from the northwest and may be a little bit pickier than most Arizonans when it comes to Asian food and this is the best Vietnamese food I have had in the desert. I love the pho and I really enjoy their fresh spring rolls as well. I have had the beef and seafood and they are both fantastic as far as Pho goes. 

My boyfriend ordered off the Chinese menu and said it was meh. Not impressed, so I wouldn't recommend it.

If you are looking for super casual and yummy comfort food stop in and enjoy some delicious soup!"}
{"text":"Okay, this is my first review ever. Only writing one because I am so pleased with the pho here. This is the first pho place that had legit, authentic pho. And I'm from California.. little Saigon/Westminster area of orange county so I know what REAL pho tastes like. I ordered togo and was quite happy that they included everything I requested. Other places usually don't listen very well. They had the saté chili and the extra oil I requested on the side. The broth was quite flavorful compared to other pho broths I've had in Arizona. The meat was fresh and delicious. Everything was perfect. If you're looking for real, authentic pho in Tempe.. this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place.   They got it right.  Pho is wonderful.  Price reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been here several times- I live about five mins away. I always leave super satisfied  pictured here are the spring rolls and Pho Tai. 

A great local place for pho  the service is always really fast and friendly. It has a great family run vibe while also being super high quality good. If you're looking for some awesome Vietnamese food that's well priced this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great food. Very authentic pho and spring rolls. Family owned, and very friendly. Lots of locals come here because the food is great!"}
{"text":"The Pho here is perfect! It's become my comfort food...if I'm sick I'm eating a bowl of this vs. traditional chicken noodle. I e also tried several other items off their menu and haven't been disappointed. The staff is very helpful with questions and menu suggestions."}
{"text":"The Best Pho in the Valley. Hands down. Anyone who knows good Pho will tell you this. 

No, it's not a super fancy spot.
No, it's probably not the best looking restaurant
No, it's not a large expanse (You'll be lucky to get a seat)
Yes, it's hard to find.

But they know what they're doing. I will look past all the negative aesthetic drawbacks, and enjoy a bowl...because it's that good.

The broth is the most flavorful I have ever had the pleasure of slurping, the vegetables are the freshest I have ever snapped between my teeth, and the noodles are the most perfectly cooked (a little past el dente).

Order take out and enjoy it in the comfort of your well appointed kitchen, or living room for that matter. That's what I have done anyway."}
{"text":"By far .... The best Pho place around!  Tasty broth, plenty of meat & great service.  A must try."}
{"text":"It was a particularly chilly, grey day after an all nighter storm, and my boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place while desperately looking for \"a place that makes huge bowls of soup\". Not much for ambiance, of course, but the food - OH MAN. 7-8 bucks gets you a steaming large bowl of pho. Spring rolls weren't bad either!

The one thing that MIGHT bother people (just not me, because I've travelled around Asia a lot) is you'll have to walk to the end of the kitchen to get to the bathroom. It's not an unpleasant walk, and the bathroom is clean."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place! I'm new to Tempe and I had been dying to get my Vietnamese food fix! I decided to order takeout and I am so happy I did! The employee over the phone was very friendly and I got there in about 15 minutes and my food was ready. I ordered the spring rolls and pork rice vermicelli. So delicious! I think the portion sizes were perfect and the prices were pretty reasonable. Next time I plan on dining in and trying the Pho! I hate to get pho takeout so I truly need to get around to trying it. The restaurant is small but clean. I will 100% return and I give this place 5 stars for what it is. It's delicious, it's nimble, and its reasonable."}
{"text":"The pho was amazing! I was in search of a good pho place while being out of town. I was a little nervous because of how picky I am when it comes to pho. It is definitely a hole in the wall. I would recommend the #4 if you get pho. So amazing!"}
{"text":"Love the PHO!  We recently moved here from Southern California the home of amazing pho and this is now our goto place. We have tried several and landed here."}
{"text":"I stopped by here due to other pho restaurants closing at 9pm, let me start off by saying bring your own water. The water they serve is absolutely the nastiest thing I've ever drank in my life, it makes tap water taste like wine. Now on to the food, I ordered a number 4, and the portion sizes are just ridiculously small here.. my bowl size is the size for child. The flavors were good, he broth tasted amazing and the meat was good. Overall, with the quality of the water and he small portion sizes, I would not come back here again. But the food was good."}
{"text":"I got the Bun Bo Hue. The portion was big, like any other Vietnamese restaurant. The meat in the soup was very very x3 hard. The beef slices were so hard that I couldn't eat chew on it. It was also dry and dark colored. I'm very sure it's old beef. Leftover beef and cooked again or something. It was honestly so hard that I'm a little scared now lol. They give you a lot of the meat, but then it just went to waste because I couldn't even eat it at all. I do like how they give you a lot of pork blood cubes, which are my favorite part of the dish. I felt like the broth needed more flavor to it. I had to put like two table spoons of fish sauce to the soup, which I normally do not. Maybe the soup just needed to be cooked longer so the flavor can build up. They had a $10 card minimum."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant that I wouldn't have noticed if it wasn't because of my foodie friend. Apparently it has been around for quite many years. Staffs are friendly and food comes out quickly. I ordered a rare steak Pho for dinner. Portion is generous but unfortuntely the meat isn't rare and a bit overcooked. However, the broth is absolutely delicioius. I also ordered a dessert type or drink with 3 different types of beans in it. Again, it is sweet and delicious. I will come back here again to try different types of dishes"}
{"text":"My favorite Pho place in AZ. I always ask for rare beef so I can cook it in the broth on the spot which makes it extra tender. Their crab puffs are the bomb.com"}
