{"text":"Great food. Great prices. Clean restaurant. Las Vegas' NEW A MUST!! Ordered the Salmon Bowl, while the kids got the Unagi bowl... both were yummy!!"}
{"text":"Shoutout to the cuties behind the counter making the poke bowls! ;)  Super bomb, must try."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant while looking for a place to eat on my trip to Vegas. Since it was a grand opening, I figured, why not. I tried the sashimi bowl with mixed assorted fish and was delighted by the fresh taste. The ratio of fish to rice was just to my liking. The staff was friendly and helped me choose the right bowl to gratify my odd, insatiable hunger for that lunch period. Their unique selection definitely will make me explore the other options available on their menu."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast service.  I like it.  Come back more.   The burrito is very good. Fresh food.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I was in town for business trip and wanted something fresh for lunch.  I happen to drive by Spring Mountain rd and happen to see this place with grand opening sign so decided to give it a try. First of all, it's chipotle like set up where you could see what they are putting in with your own eye. This was a plus as I was able to trust that is going into my mouth. I had sashimi bowl which had combination of 6 to 7 different kind of sashimi with rice and mixed green.  Food was awesome and loved the freshness of the ingredients.  it also came out with miso soup and sweet potato chips.  Miso soup was AMAZING! I would be sure to come back to this place on my next business trip.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"7.5/10 stars. The food was great and the service was friendly but it was a little slow. It was understandable, as they seemed to be training a new employee but I was in a bit of a rush and it would've been nicer to get my food faster.   I got the sea world sushi burrito, which was delicious and had a good amount of fish in it.  Overall, it you're like me and you're curious about sushi burrito trend, this is a great place to try it out for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place is just nee and trendy. The tuna is huge disgusting chunks just put on top of a salad. No taste, no style no common sense to cut the tuna up"}
{"text":"Good place for getting a sushi burrito fix!  Prices are the same as other places offering similar menu; however, the advantage here is that you get free side orders of sweet potato chips and miso soup if you dine in. Also free mochi ice cream if you leave a yelp review so it's a win-win for both sides :)."}
{"text":"It's always nice to find a new restaurant in town that you want to return to. I've never had a sushi burrito and have been seeing these places pop up everywhere. I wondered if it was made with a tortilla and maybe was a reason I hesitated trying them earlier. To my delight, it was rice with ingredients inside and then simply rolled with seaweed. I loved it. It's funny how they call it a burrito. In Japan, this is just called a futomaki roll with different ingredients inside and has been around forever. When it's introduced to America with \"burrito\" slapped to its name, people think it's new, and it becomes a new craze (like ramen, which has been around in Japan forever). Anyway, I really enjoyed my sushi burrito since I've always loved futomaki rolls. It was fresh, and I liked the ingredients. The only problem was that there weren't many choices for me since I don't eat raw fish, but I could go back and just eat the same thing. The restaurant was very clean and the service was great. The cashier was patient when I asked her questions (for example, no tortillas, right?) about this new thing called the sushi burrito."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fresh and filling. Staff was very friendly and happy to help. Loved the Santa Monica Burrito. Will be back to try everything else."}
{"text":"Really Good! Ordered a make your own sushi burrito with tofu, avocado and spinach. I really liked it with the cilantro aoili. It came with complimentary sweet potato chips, which were good too. This will definitely be my go to spot when I'm near China Town."}
{"text":"Ordered the poke bowl and it was amazing! Everything was cooked perfectly! You could definitely taste each individual ingredient! I usually get one of the burritos but I went on a limb and I'm glad I did, California Sushi Burrito never fails me whenever I'm in the mood for some type of seafood! The drivers are always polite, the food is always fresh, and the delivery is always on time, usually early. I definitely recommend!!'"}
{"text":"I love Sushi Bowls.  This place is fantastic.  Always fresh and the make my bowl just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Sushi and burrito lovers, rejoice! Delicious, fresh, close-ish to strip and great pricing make this an ideal find for locals and visitors alike. Attentive and friendly staff craft yummy creations to your custom orders. Super place."}
{"text":"I know this place is new but they have stolen my heart and earned a five star review. They make bowls and burritos with fresh fish and tasty add ons. The miso soup is delicious as well. My sister and I popped in on a Saturday afternoon and the guys working were really patient with us taking fooooooorever to make up our minds on how to create the perfect sushi burrito. They gave us complimentary and totally legit sweet potato chips. I ended up getting the Santa Monica wrap and it definitely put Jaburritos to shame. Check. Them. Out."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!!! Staff is great always welcoming and very nice. The quality is great, I've had some pretty bad experiences, but this place is great!!"}
{"text":"Love the ease of the location and how clean it is. Definitely could use some better flavor profiles and the bowls are limited unlike other poke places. Still a good find!"}
{"text":"A ton of sushi burrito spots have popped up over the last year or so, but California Sushi Burrito is one of the few doing things right! I'm usually a poke bowl person but CSB's burritos are stuffed with so much fresh fish that it's hard to resist going hand-held. The SeaWorld is my fave, with a great sauce that is light without being overpowering, while the Blue Ocean comes in a close second. Next, I'll probably try the Palm Springs. For their grand opening special, dine-in orders come with sweet potato chips and a miso soup- no soup for you if you take your order to go."}
{"text":"Delicious burrito, fabulous service and great vibes!! I chose the SeaWorld wrap and they customized it for me.  The free sides to eat in are totally worth staying! Highly recommend this cute hot spot!"}
{"text":"4/5 stars, easy! Such a cute little 'hole in the wall' sushi spot. Portions are great! Their small bowls are bigger AND better than most sushi take out spots. Not to mention they offer sides w/ your burritos or bowls! You get a good sized cup/bowl of miso soup and banana chips. Which definitely completes the meal, perfectly. I've only dined in twice, but I think it's safe to say it's become one of my go to spots for take out sushi. Most definitely would recommend this place to anyone...Especially if you're craving sushi on your lunch break, the wait time from when you order to when you get it is literally 5-10 minutes (max). & that's the kind of \"fast food\" I'm looking for sometimes  nonetheless, my experience overall has been wonderful each time. Definitely stop by if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Sweet potato chips were delightful despite the fact that I'm not a huge sweet potato fan in the first place. We got the sashimi bowl and the poke burrito, both were delicious!! Huge poke fan and this place is up there for one of the best I've tried!"}
{"text":"I definitely Recommend this place to anyone.  My favorite would be the boss j.  The chips are also so good.  I will definitely  come back and try out the other burritos."}
{"text":"Found my new go-to poke spot! Stopped by recently and I'm super glad I did. The food is great and the quality is fantastic! The interior is also very clean and chic with a variety of stuff on the menu.  I got the Sashimi Poke Bowl for about $12 full size and the portions are generous. Couldn't even finish it so I might just get the smaller bowl for like $9 next time instead. The bottom is split into half mixed greens salad and half rice. It was well seasoned and topped with a TON of Poke and seaweed salad. The flavor was very good and the fish tasted fresh with a nice texture.  They were also running an offer of a side of free sweet potato fries/miso soup depending on what you get. The soup was decent but I wasn't much for the fries. They also have mochi ice cream available!   Overall, I would definitely recommend and I'll be back! (:"}
{"text":"Love it best sushi burrito in town very cute place and good prices and also cool people who work there"}
{"text":"Living in vegas there's many options for a good sushi burrito, but once you have the blue ocean sushi burrito you'll understand what separates California sushi burrito from the rest. Amazing staff, place looks amazing and Juan made sure my experience was something to remember! Looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"First off, I have to say, this place looks great! It looks super small and kind of sketchy on the outside, but inside it looks so cute! The staff is also very helpful and kind!  I got a Salmon Bowl, and it was so good! It was very refreshing and the fish is very high quality. It with several other toppings like tamago, salad, and avocado. My meal also came with a side of miso soup and sweet potato fries.  My only deal is that it took a while(?) but I was with a party of like 12, so it's totally understandable. I would stop by for some more lunch breaks if I lived in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"First time I've seen this place, which I think is a chain restaurant. The thought of a sushi burrito sounded odd but we didn't have much time and wanted something light and quick.   Boy was it a pleasant surprise! The service was quick and pleasant. I got the sushi bowl and the sashimi was fresh with generous portions, so much so that I couldn't finish. Perfect!  I'd definitely go back if I ever see one again."}
{"text":"I went this place for lunch while i was in las vegas, and lt was really good. The place looked clean and nice and service was really good. All the ingredients were fresh and ready to serve. If you are looking for quick lunch or togo place for dinner, i think this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and I must say I would definitely eat from there again. My sushi/burrito was great. It was a baked salmon with cream cheese and other stuff but either way it was delicious. The only thing it was missing was spicyness. I'm assuming I had to ask for wasabi and we didn't.  So that was our bad. We couldn't fix the issue since we got this food delivered at work and it was fast. Next time I'll know. But other than it I give it a thumbs up. :)"}
{"text":"The food is really good here friends introduced it to us and I keep telling other friends about this place. Lovely environment, amazing food (burrito/bowl), and friendly staff. :)"}
{"text":"Tako cheese.. I can't believe no one has written a review about this deliciousness yet. It's a combination of crab mix, cheese, corn, octopus and scallops all baked with eel sauce and served hot. It's INSANELY good. It's very similar to dynamite if you've ever tried that at a sushi restaurant before. It's usually on the appetizer side.   I ordered the tako cheese and a salmon bowl and it was around $15. I ordered for delivery because this place is in Chinatown and ain't nobody got time for that! The salmon bowl comes with: salmon, crab mix, spicy tuna, tamago (this is a Japanese egg type thing, really good!), onion, red pepper, sesame,soy sauce, furikake, sushi rice, mixed greens and seaweed paper. What I got was a bowl that had many of the above mentioned items, but no red pepper, and instead had pineapple. I love pineapple and I am glad that they included it, but other people may not be happy about the surprise additions/lack of items. Also, tamago, where have you been all my life? This stuff is good, although I do find it an odd ingredient for a poke bowl. They also had seaweed paper on the side in a bag. Again, weird ingredient for a poke bowl.   For my sauces I chose spicy garlic ponzu, and hot yum and spicy yum, which is basically sweet and spicy mayo. I got them on the side so I could taste them and add to my bowl as needed. They charge $0.25 for extra sauce, but I am a sauce lover so I loved having this option.   Some things to note. They may not offer BYO bowls? I ordered for delivery but I didnt see any byo option on the menu. I thought the price for the salmon bowl was great. It was like $10.50 for a huge bowl with 3 scoops of fish and a generous amount of toppings. The bowl was enough for 2 servings. With my meal I received a side of sweet potato chips for free. Those things are sooo good! They appear to be deep fried and then tossed in sugar. I added some salt to mine so I got the sweet/salty thing going on and it was so yum.   I will definitely be back to try their sushi burritos and get that tako cheese again."}
{"text":"AMAZING i go every week ! My usual is the Salmon bowl but with no pineapple (im allergic, and no onion bits) that's just me! I've tried so many sushi burrito places and this is by far THEE best ever I am for sure not going anywhere else , it is packed with flavor you can tell they take pride in their ingredients ! I recently tried the Taco cheese bowl and let me tell you!!!! Blew me away oh my gosh! I have sent so many people there including my parents and they are hooked ! They have stamp cards too! The prices are great in my opinion for something so flavorful and filling its perfect. The greeting, the service, and the cleanliness of the whole place is ON POINT! I love this place fact I'm going tonight for dinner ^.^  Definitely worth a try you will not be let down!"}
{"text":"Cool spot. Good bowls but they took like 15 mins to make and it wasn't busy, I appreciated the free miso and sweet potato chips. We had a free yelp soda with check in, but all the sodas were flat. Whoops. I'd come again overall."}
{"text":"I ordered the Palm Spring Sushi Burrito. Bomb. Nice place to eat here in Chinatown, chill place.   Customer's service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places to go to! They're all always super nice & generous when it comes to portions. It's aesthetically pleasing in all ways. There's complimentary taro chips and miso soup when you dine in! Everything about this place is always spot on (-: make sure to get a punch card for every time you visit, too! Good food, good service, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute :)  Always great customer service in here. Fun vibes, great upbeat music every time I come in, food is always made promptly and done really well and always tastes great as well :) Plus they have a stamp card too! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place and conveniently right behind my home!  Mochi ice cream is my favorite."}
{"text":"The poke burrito was really good. Slightly too much sauce, but the flavors really complimented each other. Even got free miso soup and sweet potato chips just for dining in! Yum!"}
{"text":"INSANELY good. Wow. I have poke all the time, but I'll admit I've never had it in a burrito format. I got the Santa Monica and oh my goodness, my eyes popped at the sight of it. First of all, it's HUMONGOUS and well worth the ~$10. They do not skimp on their fillings, which include various types of fish, shellfish, and tempuras and finished off with some veggies and sauces. You also have the ability to custom make your burrito if you choose. It's wrapped in a bed of rice and sealed with nori.  It's absolutely delicious, I cannot stress how good it is for the price. It's fresh and just really well made. The ingredients they put in there perfectly balance each other out and the ratios of fillings to rice is just right. If you check-in on Yelp, you get a free soda and if you eat in, miso soup and chips are included! I highly recommend this place for some good cheap eats in Vegas. I'd go here at least once a week if I lived in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and fresh fish and good atmosphere. Can you ask for more? They give a complimentary miso soup and plantain chips for dine-in customers.Over all great experience and if I spend enough time in Vegas I'll come back..."}
{"text":"Great burritos tried the raiders and the Santa Monica burritos and they were delicious and very large for the price, came with miso soup and chips that were sweet and the miso soup was delicious.."}
{"text":"Very good service . I enjoyed the food very much. The staff was very nice .  If you hungry for something different you have to check them out"}
{"text":"Like all the other sushi burrito places that have popped up in Las Vegas in the past year, California Sushi Burrito is right up there with JaBurritos and Pokeman. However I do have to say, California Sushi Burrito prices are a bit cheaper and their customer service is a tad bit better. They offer a lot of good deals like free soda with yelp check-in, free miso soup for any burrito/bowl done in, and sweet potato chips with any burrito/bowl takeout.   The Santa Monica and Poke burrito were both very tasty. It had the perfect amount of sauce/fish/topping ratio. My boyfriend has never tried a sushi burrito ever and he thoroughly enjoyed it for a first timer. We highly recommend this spot if you're ever in the area!   Don't forget to ask about heir stamp card if you're a loyal poke eater. From looking at the card, it looks like buy 6, get one free, buy another 4, get another free! They don't allow combining cards, so don't forget to bring your card with you!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and fresh fish. Can you ask for more? And they give a complimentary miso soup and plantain chips for dine-in customers. Over all great experience and if I spend enough time in Vegas I'll come back..."}
{"text":"The BEST!  Hands down!  Working graveyard  , I get off work at 10am and always looking for a good place for lunch.  All the other sushi burrito places don't open till 11am. California Sushi opens at 10am!  I can call ahead my order and pick it up on my way home!    And the food is 100.99% amazing!!  Sushi bowls with sashimi, salad, sushi rice!  Come with 4 pieces of roasted sea weed and a bowl of fried sweet potato chips!!!  Absolutely amazing!  Vegas native and this is my fav place!!!!   Thanks you guys!! You're amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place got some pretty good sushi burritos. They definitely DO NOT skim you on contents. My Santa Monica burrito was PACKED with yummy goodness-spicy tuna, crab mix, shrimp tempura....oh man...typing this is making my mouth salivate! Boyfriend got the Blue Ocean and he really enjoyed his as well. For those of you who like soft shell crab....this is the burrito to get!   I really appreciate the fact that they give you a free bowl of miso soup for every burrito or bowl you order. I love me some miso!!!!! Came out pippin hot too! Also, checking in on Yelp gives you one free soda.  But what happened to also getting a free order of the sweet potato chips? Prior to coming here, I was looking through multiple reviews and most mentioned they got sweet potato chips along with their miso soup? Hmmmm.....unless they dealt away with the chips now."}
{"text":"Great service it was my first time here. The fish is fresh The ambience of the actual restaurant is nice the employees are very kind and nice even though they messed my order up and put masago when I asked for none when I called the young Lady put me on hold and the owner Juno jumped on the phone he was very kind and apologetic gave me a refund and offered a free bowl for my next visit. To me that's awesome customer service even though they messed up. Juno went above and beyond to correct the mistake and make his customer happy. You can't find great customer service everywhere and they definitely have it. Thx Juno."}
{"text":"I come here first time to try Sushi Burritos because I just ate sushi rolls. I ordered Palm Spring and Tako cheese. Palm Spring includes salmon, avocado, rice and vegy. How good they are! I got free of sweet potatoes and miso soup when dining in. It's so great! I love miso soup which makes me better. ;)  The staff is friendly and helpful. She answered my questions. I like the decoration too. It's nice! Before I leave, I buy a bottle of Oi Ocha, Japanese green tea. I will come back to try the other burritos."}
{"text":"this place is awesome!  saw this place in construction for few months while commute and finally got to try them today.  all the ingredients are fresh and staffs were really nice.  dont really have much experience with pokes and sushi burritos, but the staff was kind and patience with me.  place was clean and restroom was also very clean! price is right for lunch and maybe dinner to-gos."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and it's such a great value. It's better than going to an AYCE restaurant because it's half the price and just as filling."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Very fresh, delicious & healthy! Family & I stopped here on the way out of Vegas .... omg the perfect spot. Very clean inside well decorated and amazing service. The food was bomb! Definitely stop here if you love good sushi. WILL be returning."}
{"text":"Trendy healthy food at a reasonable price! I had sushi burrito in SF for the first time and fell in love with it. I was surprise to find sushi burrito in Vegas! The place was clean and neat which I appreciate. I got the Santa Monica and it was fresh and DELICIOUS! I can tell that they use good ingredients. I would definitely go back again when I'm back in Vegas. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Been here more than a few times.  Really enjoy their burritos.  All the ones I have tired have been tasty.  In the Chinatown area, there are a lot of choices for sushi.  If you do not want to stuff yourself, this a great quick and fast choice.  Great for lunch!  Orders come with sweet chips.  Will continue to revisit for a portion controlled meal."}
{"text":"So good . I order the sea world burrito and it's so good first time trying it . And they customer services there is awesome as well"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi burrito place hands down in Vegas. Everything is so delicious and perfect most of the time. I came here more than 15 times already and used to come here every week. I introduced this place to my other friends and they now come here every week. I haven't been able to go recently due to a change in diet but as soon as I'm done, I'll be back to eating here every week.   The price is cheaper than other sushi burrito places and the more expensive options are worth it as they pack on so much more fish. My favorites are the unagi bowl, the sashimi bowl, and the beef bowl. They also include free miso soup and chips if you dine in.   Don't forget to get their stamp card as their stamp card has 2 free entrees instead of just 1 that most places do. I only wish this place got more popular because everytime I came those 15 times, the place was dead empty and me and my friend were the only customers for an hour."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Exquisite food, and their portions are big. The price is definitely on th"}
{"text":"This place is good! Bowls are huge! And great presentation. Good customer service and it's on my way to work so it's perfect. Wish you guys luck! I recommend this place."}
{"text":"New place! Great options and a nice environment. I will be back to try more! The burrito I got was delicious and can't remember what I ordered but will update the review next time I go!"}
{"text":"I decided to pop in on my lunch because this was the closest sushi burrito spot from my job.  Boy, the parking situation was funky due to Garionban and 8oz Korean Steakhouse on the other side of the plaza.   Now the interior looks very nice. There are tables with chairs but there are also seats that line the walls, decorated with pillows for maximum comfort. It was giving off more of a cafe vibe but nonetheless a creative touch. I ordered the Blue Ocean which was an alright type of good. I was not digging the lettuce and the shrimp tempura too much. I had to pick them out :-( My order also came with a side of chips, but I did not like them that much either.   Service.. hmm was not that good. So when I entered, there were a couple of people seated and obviously waiting for their orders to be done. From my experience at other sushi burrito spots, you order, watch them make your burritos until it gets to the register and finally you pay.  Here, you go straight to the register, order, pay and then wait until they make your order.   With that being said, one of the employees told me to wait as he made the other orders. There were two people working, but they were talking and doing everything slowly. It took them 15 minutes before taking my order and it took them another 10 minutes to make my burrito. I'm sure they would have made my order quickly if I said I was in a rush, but... they were too busy in their conversation and I did not expect it to take them that long."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Wednesday. They have tables inside and 3 outside. I ordered the Raiders burrito which has a couple different spicy fish. You get to see them make the burrito in front of you which was cool. The portion is massive! Def one burrito will fill you up! Adding sauces to it costs extra but they have soy sauce and siracha for free. Dining in they give you fried sweey potatoe chips which are good. Burrito was very tasty. Would def eat again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  They have a lot of variety at fair prices.  Very pleasant people - very helpful!    I had the poke bowl to go, but I need to come back for their Unagi bowl"}
{"text":"best sushi burrito ever! very delicious !  must try it! evrything is so fresh and clean."}
{"text":"California Sushi Burrito..  I would say that this place has really delicious sushi burritos! I would recommend anyone to come here and try their sushi burritos  Like oh my gosh..very very delicious. And they have different kinds of sushi burritos with unique names (?) The customer service is kind and friendly. When you go inside, there's an ocean, beachy vibe and it fits right with the restaurant. But again, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I like it very much! Today is my first time coming here. The store is really nice and clean. The menu is on TV display really clear. I ordered boss j , it's really good ! I love this place will be in my lunch list for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the large bowl with salmon sashimi. Service was fast. Easy place to grab a casual lunch and then go for a massage."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA, found this awesome sushi burritos & bowls joint. I tried ton of sushi poke and burritos places in LA and, I must say, this place is legit! My fiancé and I ordered Salmon poke bowl and one of the sushi burritos options (they have many original options) and they were absolutely delicious. Fish was fresh, plates were well balanced and flavored juuuu~st right. Great service, awesome ambience and, most importantly, A+++ food! Keep up the good work Cali Sushi Burrito!"}
{"text":"My first time experiencing this place was amazing !! I'm surprised this place hasn't franchised already! And watching it while it is made makes the experience everything."}
{"text":"Today service was bad. I went around lunch and waited for around 25 mins before I finally had to get up and inquire about my food. A customer that came in recently got his food within 5 mins.  Even a couple that came in before waited for their food for a long time only to find out, the order was incorrect.   To CSB, allocate your time wisely with dine-in customers and to-go. You have quality food but don't let your customers wait to long. Most come in during their lunch break."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Great quality and great price. Taste great! Love it so much! Thank you for you being here Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant with amazing food . They offer delivery with EAT24 and GrubHub ... The food was delivered extremely fast on 16 miles from the restaurant ! Definitely will   Order again !! Thanks California Sushi Burrito"}
{"text":"My buddy and I love sushi burritos and were looking for a new spot to try out. A quick Yelp search landed us at California Sushi Burrito and we weren't disappointed at all. I had the Santa Monica Burrito and loved it. The only ding I can give this place is that they didn't seem to offer a soy paper wrap as opposed to the seaweed wrap, which is something other places offer. But my burrito was delicious nonetheless. The interior was super clean and well-decorated. My only concern is that, while we were there between about 11:40 am and 12:15 pm, nobody else came in to eat....only two mobile delivery guys. So, help this place out and hit up California Sushi Burrito!"}
{"text":"Super delicious! Fair pricing. Loved the crab mix and complimentary miso soup and sweet potato chips"}
{"text":"Really good seafood and great value! I came here with my family and they were very patient with us as we ordered all of our food. Everything was made quickly and tasted very fresh."}
{"text":"I've come here for takeout for at least 10 times now.  I love the salmon bowl and sashimi bowl.  The portion is generous and the taste is on point!  Even the sushi rice is extra tasty here.  The bowls also come with complimentary potato chips and seaweed sheets.  The fish was never fishy.  This place is definitely in its own league when it comes to sushi burrito/bowl places in town.  Hands down the best value and great taste!   Call ahead if you are in a hurry.  It usually takes 10- 20 minutes for the bowls which were made through a meticulous and thorough process.  I've seen it with my own eyes!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week, sushi bowls are the best in town and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Food is great, great atmosphere in the restaurant also. I highly recommend trying the Santa Monica burrito. Liz was super courteous and very friendly. Come and try them! I even got a free drink for just checking in!"}
{"text":"I didn't actually try the sushi burrito myself, but got their Beef Noodle Bowl instead. This was absolutely delicious! It's got right amount of beef and rice, so you're not left with awkward amount of either items. If you dine in, you get free miso soup and chips too.  My bf's sushi burrito was pretty good too. It looks like they also serve boba here. We didn't get to try it here, but these were extremely popular among kids who were also dining at the restaurant. I will definitely come back and try other items on their menu too :) One more thing - They are closed on Sundays, so make sure you try them on a different day."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of the poke bars that have been popping up in town . This one is on the same parallel it seems . Walk up counter service . The guys making the burrito were a little slow and looking at the ingredients list while making which can be expected at a newer establishment .The ingredients were fresh and tasty . I  tried the blue ocean sushi burrito which was good and came as listed on the menu minus lettuce by my choice. The interior is very clean and has a modern ish design. There is some outside seating (3 tables ) for the nicer nights . They could be a little quicker making the food .Overall a quality poke -sushi burrito spot ."}
{"text":"I don't live in Vegas, but I come pretty often and on my last 3 or so trips, I've been making an effort to try the sushi burrito I had been hearing so much about. We got a group of friends together (which actually included the guy who reviewed below me lol) a couple weeks ago to try California Sushi Burrito... I must say, the sushi burrito was everything I dreamed it to be. I ordered the Blue Ocean Burrito, which included an entire soft shell crab as well as a crab mixture and shrimp tempura inside its delicious wrapping. Since we were dining in, it also included complimentary sweet potato chips and miso soup... all for around $10! AND if you check in on Yelp, you get a free drink, making this a large and very economical meal. The Blue Ocean burrito was delicious, it had a ton of flavor and was very filling. I personally don't like sweet potatoes, so I was not a fan of the sweet potato chips, and I also did not really like the miso soup, but I enjoyed my sushi burrito so much that I did not care. I 100% would return here and get the same thing again."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place!!!  Food is amazing and fresh!!  Its a very comfortable place to just sit and enjoy your meal, good music,  and all around a very pleasant experience.  A must go and a new lunch date area for me and my hunny!"}
{"text":"Great sushi burrito sets itself apart by a friendly more personable atmosphere and a little California flair. Worth trying out definitely good food."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great service and lots of food for the price. I got the salmon bowl and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for a few hours and was craving Sushi. This place a stood out to me. Staff was friendly and recommended the Santa Monica Sushi Buritto. It was excellent. It also came with complimentary sweet potato chips as well. Will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Hey this place is great  the atmosphere is very chill and different. As far as the portions ? Every time I've been here I come out extremely full. You won't be disappointed ! The owner is very helpful and nice ! Give this place a shot !"}
{"text":"My new favorite Sushi Burrito spot.  (Sorry Soho)  They are super nice.  Prices are great.    They give you sweet potato fries free.   Very pretty inside.   Furniture and decor is so much fancier than Soho.  Don't tell the whole world about this place because I'd like it to be my exclusive hot spot!"}
{"text":"Yummy food! Love the menu and excellent mix and taste. I also love the fact they were willing to switch out an item that was too spicy for me. Free sweet potato fries with meal and when dining in free miso soup. Beautiful ambiance - elegant but homey and comfortable, love the color scheme and style. Clean and nice bathroom. Awesome customer service. They were really friendly, helpful, and nice. They go above and beyond. I would go back especially. Everyone's gotta try this place. Great value for money and excellent experience."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place, awesome atmosphere, food is impeccable, just thinking about the food makes my heart melt, excellent service, I always get the sashimi bowl, comes with a ton of fish varieties."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite quick, yummy, inexpensive sushi spot in Las Vegas!  Tried 2 different burritos and they were perfect!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST!  I ordered the salmon Bowl it was amazing, the portion size is so big, I was very impressed with the flavor, and the fish it was very fresh. Also had two other friends order as well, both got sushi burrito and they absolutely loved it. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"The best salmon sushi burrito I have ever eaten! Get the Santa Monica with salmon! You won't regret it! You also get free miso soup and sweet potato chips!"}
{"text":"The burrito I ordered had too much imitation crab and sauces so the burrito didn't keep in fold and came fell apart. Other than that, the burrito tasted great and fresh! I ordered typical poke burrito ( number 1) . You just need to make sure they don't put too much stuff! You can see the guy making it in front of you so that's something you should keep in mind."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful find!!  The place is clean and artsy, the decorations is refreshing and inviting but most importantly, the food is awesome!!  Simple menu and fresh ingredients.  Juno recommended the Santa Monica, very yummy and plenty of poke and very tasty.    Everything behind the counter is super clean and service is fast and friendly.  I will definitely come back and try different items in the menu.  Fast, casual and good tasting food!!"}
{"text":"California Sushi Burrito is a very sophisticated place, but it is also very casual. The food is DELICIOUS!!!!!!! It has just the right amount of flavor. They offer many different sides. It was delightful. Overall, this is a very nice place."}
{"text":"This place omgosh I love it! I'm not going to another poke bowl place again! Thank you for the delicious sashimi bowl. If you're reading this review don't hesitate to come here you won't regret it. I love sushi and poke places and yeah this has been the best so far! Haha and I never write reviews"}
{"text":"Super cute decor & clean with friendly staff. I don't have much experience with sushi  so I can't compare the food to other locations, but the Blue Ocean burrito was tasty."}
{"text":"Great service very helpful since I'm new to the sushi world but love it very clean as well"}
{"text":"So good!  Yum!  Loved it! I had the sea world burrito!  Restaurant is so cute inside! Workers are friendly"}
{"text":"We ordered two blue ocean sushi bowls that were amazing. The bowl was a little bigger than a traditional bowl but not as deep which was really nice because it wasn't a cluster fuck. It was clean and well represented. The restaurant itself was very clean and well kept. I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I love this place. The bowls are loaded with tons of fresh fish, salad, and rice. If you dine in you get free miso soup and their house made chips with any burrito or bowl you buy. The store is clean and well decorated."}
{"text":"The orders sometimes takes a while but I thought the food was good as well as the service. If something was inconvenient to the customer they would always try their best to keep them satisfied!"}
{"text":"I am so sad this place is closed. We used to come here almost weekly and it was quality food unlike Soho Burrito I just went to in lieu. So sad."}
{"text":"Nothing special and a bit on the pricier side. I had expected delicious melt-in-your mouth sashimi based on the numerous 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"This is nothing less than amazing! The food is SO good. I recommend getting the taco cheese. The place is insanely clean and has a very hipster urban feel to the restaurant. Def coming back!"}
{"text":"Another great sushi burrito place around Chinatown. My first time visiting here I ordered myself a salmon burrito. Everything was delicious. The salmon was fresh, the lunch comes with a miso soup and some chips. Not a fan of the chips thoug. The area is a little small but easy to find. A lot of parking to find as well. Will come back to try the bowl since the burrito is a little small for me and didn't fill me up."}
{"text":"Fun spot for a sushi bowl or a sushi burrito. It tasted nice and fresh (I know, we're in Vegas but I'm from Seattle) which says a lot.  The sauce was mild and the tuna came through which is important for me."}
{"text":"My name is Maritza and this is my number one Favorite Place to eat!! I have recommended this place to so many people and I will continue doing it because of the great service it provides as well as the tasty food they serve. The manager here is very nice and the way he carries him self is very professional. I love that I can call to make an order in advance and it's always done when I get there. I remember the manager recommended the Santa Monica on the first day and ever since I have loved it !"}
{"text":"BOMB!! Honestly, I have had a lot of sushi burritos and they are always hit and miss or shall I say miss miss miss hit LOL.. But honestly I have eaten here a couple times and it has been hit hit everytime!! Keep up the great work and amazing and fresh fish."}
{"text":"I am visiting from Chicago and we stopped by to check it out after seeing the grand opening signs. Best decision we have made so far here in Vegas! The service is fantastic and the food absolutely delicious. I highly recommend coming here. Such a great take on sushi, five stars!"}
{"text":"cozy place. Easy to grab quick bite, and the parking is big. Fish is fresh and they give you free soda when you check in yelp."}
{"text":"There are many good things about this place but I gave it 4 stars for a couple reasons.  Pros: Good fish portion.  They weigh it out so its consistent every time.  I thought they were pretty generous with the amount of fresh fish  Friendly staff and clean restaurant.  The staff is really nice and the space is very clean and new.  Its a good environment  Flavors were pretty good.  I chose the salmon bowl (normal size) and thought all the ingredients went really well together.  It was toped with salon, seaweed salad, tamago, crab meat, spicy tuna, crunchy wontons and cucumbers.    I opted for salad instead of rice and they didn't have a problem with that.  All bowls and burritos comes with complimentary sweet potato chips and they give you a free soda with a yelp check in!  Cons:   To be fair, the reason why I gave it 4 stars is just how the poke restaurant is structured.  I think I prefer a poke bar where you can add as many ingredients as you want.  This place the bowls are all structured with set ingredients.  Options are a little limited.  You also don't get too many options with sauces.    Some of the fish pieces were a little chewy.  But overall it was delicious."}
{"text":"We were looking for something fast before we head to the airport and decided to try this new place. Great thing we did! We're pleasantly surprised how filling each bowl is. The ingredients are fresh (which is very important for sashimi). And they have a very cute modern interior. We'll definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Good food. Wasn't sure what to expect but it's was surprisingly good with fresh tasting fish. The sweet potato chips were goodl"}
{"text":"This was a nice switch up to my typical poke adventures. I usually go to poke express but since it was so far away decided to try this place out. I ordered the sashimi poke bowl. It came with a good amount of fish for the price and came with a complimentary sweet potato chips. And added bonus was getting a miso soup since I dined in. I was unaware this when I made my purchase but since their crew forgot the cashier made certain to give me my miso soup and apologized so nice surprise when you aren't expecting it.They also have a stamp reward program which I am not used to at poke places. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I like the sushi burritos and food bowls here. I would recommend not getting any of the large bowls since they start to taste boring after a bit. Also you gotta get the sauces my favorites are the spicy yum sauce and the eel sauce."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced sushi burrito place with great fish and lots of good toppings. They have a lot of great pre mixed options for both burritos and bowls and they include a lot of good sides, such as the miso soup and the sweet potato chips! Really cool design in the restaurant and lots of seating. Not super busy on a Monday night but would come back for sure."}
{"text":"First time here and was real good. Fresh and very clean.  Being new I need to come a couple of more times to see if it keeps its level of quality of food and service up. But for now you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"They don't offer a build your own option, and their pre-built sushi bowls don't have a whole lot of variation to them. With the exception of the beef noodle bowl, all of them had spicy tuna, furikake, and tomago. I didn't want spicy tuna or tomago, and am super picky about furikake. I won't eat it in most places. There is also a limited choice of sauces. It is a lot of food for the price, so if value is all you are looking for, then it might not be a bad choice. I think I would rather pay more and get more variety."}
{"text":"At first the thought of a sushi and burrito combo was farfetched, but you'll catch yourself taking a load off because of the calm and cozy atmosphere. The man at the register was cheerful and catered to my preferences when suggesting the \"Santa Monica\" a mixture of different fish and veggies. Clean and casual, prices are decent 10-15 dollars for a full meal"}
{"text":"I'd never had a sushi burrito until this place opened up. They were great at helping this newbie figure things out. It was great. The food is awesome! The free miso and sweet potato chips when you dine in Are the perfect addition to anything you pick from the menu. My favorites are the sashimi bowl, I recommend the small unless you're a starving orphan; also the Santa Monica burrito is the best! You'll never leave feeling hungry!!"}
{"text":"Woah, this was a great sushi bowl. I ordered the small Salmon bowl and it was the perfect size for a late lunch.  I eat poke a lot but I enjoyed that there was mixed greens in the bottom, good textured sushi rice, tempura onions, and it had seaweed paper. The miso soup was great and it also came with sweet potato chips. Such a fantastic deal for just $9. Oh and the salmon was delicious. The pieces weren't too big which I dislike at other purveyors. The owner was very attentive and I like that this is a local establishment instead of a corporate chain. The quality, service and interior ambiance were top notch. Hurry over and try anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant....food is really good...taste is amazing....the service is super fast and the employers very friendly....beef bowl is my favorite..i recoment this plate....thanks guys for all"}
{"text":"Pretty decent but not the best poke spot I've had here in vegas. Very clean and nice layout. The only complaint i had about this place is just the service needed to be more faster. Being the only customers we waited about 10-15 minutes for our bowl and burrito. Some other places get these orders in and out. I appreciated the free snacks and beverages they give when you dine in, and check in on yelp.   The fish looked pretty fresh and not that stingy with it. The only downfall is that we noticed that they didn't give us some of the toppings we requested on the check list. I don't know what happen just right after eating at this place i seemed to get a bad stomach ache. This place is still growing, and all thats missing is their service needs to be more accurate and quicker."}
{"text":"I really really like this place. It was the first place I tried a sushi burrito at and it did not disappoint. I've been here 3 other times since. The food is fresh and tasty, the staff is pretty nice and the atmosphere is super cute and relaxing. If you're in the mood for something new, try his place!!"}
{"text":"Dope little whole in the wall spot, staff is friendly , cool, accommodating and food is great and fresh. Stamp card as well"}
{"text":"Slow service. I came here for lunch and ended canceling my order because they took too long. I had ordered 1 burrito to go. I cancelled it after waiting for over 30 min. I might as well come to a sit down restaurant probably would have had faster service. At the time I was cancelling my order someone else came to get their money back because they took too long and got their wrong order. Will never be coming back again."}
{"text":"I tried this for my first time and it was so good! I had a DIY vegan bowl with brown rice. Very healthy and filing. I had the mochi green tea dessert. Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"I'd say the sushi burrito here is solid but unspectacular--I would place it in the middle of the pack in terms of Vegas sushi burrito places. So I am a bit surprised they have as strong of reviews as they do, because I didn't find the seaworld roll to be on par with the best rolls I have had elsewhere in terms of flavor profile. Not bad, worth checking out, but just not quite as much of a standout as I would have hoped."}
{"text":"This place is FRICKIN aesthetically pleasing!! And their food is bomb too. They offer free things like miso soup and chips when you order a sushi burrito or bowl (which my girlfriend LOVED) and you know what they say: happy wife, happy life!! Check it out, you won't be disappointed!!!! UPDATE: if I could turn up the stars on yelp I would because their mochi is FUEGOOOOOO"}
{"text":"Blue ocean sushi burrito is the best!!! So delicious!!! Plus it comes with a complimentary miso soup and sweet potato chips. My new favorite place."}
{"text":"I love this shop. The meals are reasonably priced and the flavors are balanced and delicious! The quality of the ingredients seems very good for the price. The staff is super friendly and they don't mind joking around with me which is always a nice personable bonus. They offer punch cards so you can end up with a free burrito, and if you go as often as I shamefully do, it adds up pretty quick. They also give you free miso soup if you eat there, and if not it's pretty cheap anyways! I recommend trying the Golden State burrito.  I brought my boyfriend here while he was in town and he ended up asking to go back THREE more times during his one week stay.  The shop is also very cute and I've never once seen the guest area or the kitchen look dirty."}
{"text":"Decent sushi burrito, wish there was a sauce to go with it. The complimentary side of sweet chips were delicious. I ordered the Golden state burrito."}
{"text":"BOMB i got the seaworld burrito omg packed with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and white fish!! super fresh and tasty!! my friend got a bowl im definately gettiing the eel one next... love this place the decor and atmosphere rock!!!"}
{"text":"Great service workers work fast food was bomb will return for the raider burrito and the poke bowls"}
{"text":"The sushi burrito was amazing and tasted great. Burrito was big and fed my boyfriend and I. I am definitely coming here next time I come to vegas!"}
{"text":"Love the ambience and choice of background music. Feels like home. No better way to eat a huge bowl of your favorites, a warm miso soup, and some taro chips. Can't wait to come back and try other options on their menu."}
