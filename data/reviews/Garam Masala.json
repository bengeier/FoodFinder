{"text":"Lived near here for a short while. We got takeout three times. Never ate in.  The dal makhani was great. Liked the fresh ginger added. Chicken Tikka masala also fairly good. Naan was fine for takeout  (never as good once it steams itself on the way home) Rice was....white rice. Not much to expect here.   This was our favorite place to get Indian takeout in the 'hood. Would definitely order again if nearby."}

{"text":"1st time having Lamb vindaloo and I was hooked! It didn't seem like a big portion at first and thought really? This is it? But by the time I was half way through dipping the great sauce with my fresh naan, I swear the button on my pants wanted to fall off. The service was great and the gentleman was very helpful. He would always refill our water without us even asking. I've always liked things like that.   The Chicken Tikka Marsala was also top notch! Soft pieces of chicken, onions and green peppers. Mmmmmm! So if you're in the area you have to check it out :)"}
{"text":"Mom and I went in here this evening and will not ever return.   The place is not very nice looking to start with but aside from that, the service was hands down the worst I've experienced in quite some time.   The server (\"Supervisor\" according to the receipt) was so incredibly unfriendly. Besides NEVER responding to either of us when we said thank you each time she placed a dish, she started off by treating us as if we were taking her away from something more important - we were the first table in the place for dinner - and snappy throughout the order, including when she asked if we wanted the dishes mild, medium, or hot. I asked my mother what she preferred and the server stood there, seemingly annoyed repeating \"mild, medium, or hot\" louder. Her rude demeanour continued from the moment we arrived until we left.  The food tasted just okay at best. The service was terrible."}
