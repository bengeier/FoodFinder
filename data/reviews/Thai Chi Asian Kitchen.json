{"text":"A new addition to the area! A well needed GOOD Thai place! So We finally decided to give this place a try!  And we were pleased!   We had made a large order for take out, for one of our weekly family gatherings! All 6 of us absolutely loved it!  The food was fresh! Tasty, and they not only knew what gluten free was but also how to accommodate! Btw The coconut sticky rice was a total hit! Will most definitely order again!!"}
{"text":"Fast and hot delivery is a big plus. Crazy mix of thai, chinese and even japanese food is kinda weird but we've ordered a bunch of different dishes and they are generally good.  The noodles are great, but I find the chicken really bland in the noodles like they cook it separately and then add it last second to noodles, not allowing it to absorb the taste of the noodles.   Not a big deal just makes us order veggie dishes more often than not.  Could also be a bit less greasy overall, but really the food here is tasty and varied and we will be ordering here again  Update: They have cut back delivery hours and the food has taken a huge downturn in quality. I will not be ordering here again."}
{"text":"We came on a weekday for lunch. The owner was very nice. Took out order promptly and the food arrived pipping hot. Portions are huge, definitely good take out type of place."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we decided to try this place for ourselves. We walked in and realized it was a fast food style, but the owner, I'm assuming, served is as though it was a sit down style and took our order.  For two orders of hot and sour soup, one won ton soup, two orders of spring rolls, an order of har gow, one order of siu Mai, chicken cashew nut chicken, pad Thai, and pineapple fried rice, with a tip came to just under $100.   The service was so friendly, he even changed the TV from CP24 to Treehouse for the girls.   The food all was so hot and fresh, the sauces were awesome and everything tasted amazing. The spring rolls were nice and crispy, the won ton' in the soup were nice and big, the portions were huge, and had a good amount of meat and shrimp.  Definitely deserving of a return visit!"}
{"text":"This place really needs some training on customer service and being accountable for their mistakes. Went in ordered take out, came home and realized missing 3 simple dishes of steamed rice.  Came back and pointed out the mistake, the order taker acknowledge the mistake but insisted on me paying for the rice. After dishing out $75.00 for the meal.  For your $4 worth of rice and your mistake you lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"Finally....been craving some decent Thai and Asian flavoured food in the area. Finally found it.  Definitely beats pizza or your typical burger joint any day.  Highly recommended."}
