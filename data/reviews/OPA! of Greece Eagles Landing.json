{"text":"This is the first time I ever walked in and out of a restaurant. I went in there with my family to grab some food. There were two guys working. The one 'greeting' the customers at the register couldn't have been more dismissive. My husband walked in first, said hi, got ignored. I walked in after, said hello, got ignored. The register guy stood there rolling his eyes while we looked at the menu like he was extremely bothered and inconvenienced by this family that just walked in. I didn't say anything but looked at my husband and expressed that I didn't trust putting the food that is served at this location in my mouth and we went next door to subway instead. My Greek food craving was not fulfilled that day."}
{"text":"Real chicken souvlaki is NOT pre-cooked and it's NOT re-fried on a griddle.  That's how McDonalds fries their burger patties.  Note to owners of this chain of \"Greek\" restaurants....start by GRILLING your souvlaki, it's the right way to do it!"}
{"text":"i tried the chicken wrap and it was amazing! great service and great food. I normally dont try take out greek food but this was a great experience and in coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Worst greek in the neighborhood.  Not very tasty and the portion is super stingy!!  And considering the price vs portion, what a rip off.  I'd rather spend my $12 at Wendy's."}
{"text":"I got the chicken souvlaki on a pita with fries and a drink. Service was very nice. The chicken was moist and flavourful, but there was a very skimpy portion of chicken on the pita. The fries were a decent portion, but they had way too much seasoning salt on them so they were quite salty. 

It was an okay meal, but expensive for the fast-casual setting. I definitely was a bit shocked by the total given the skimpy portion of chicken."}
{"text":"My first clue was probably that the place is always empty when I go by, but I was hungry for Greek food. Walked in, got ignored walked put. I was standing there for almost five minutes before a man walks up and asks if he can help me like I'm trash off the street. I said I guess not....and walled out.
Never again.
Wish I could yelp half a star."}
{"text":"We recently got take out from this location, aside all the bad reviews. We were in the area and were very hungry, especially for Greek food.
The service was great, the man who took our order was very friendly and professional.
The food was delicious and fresh!
The place was small, clean and new. It's obviously not a Fancy sit down restaurant but great to grab a quick bite. Or take out. Great salads, skewers were tender and fresh, their fries are really good! No bad comments what so ever."}
{"text":"Yeah. Don't eat here. It's the only Greek place I've been to that regularly runs out of rice and potatoes."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!
The only reason it even gets a one rating is because a rating has to be chosen.
We've ordered from this place before but through Just-Eat.ca.  This time we ordered over the phone because the drink choices online were not up to date.
I specifically gave them the directions to our place because there happen to be two streets with the same name in the Richmond Hill area.  
When our food still didn't arrive 1hr & 10 minutes after my call, I knew the driver had screwed up and went to the wrong street.
Called the restaurant - 3 times - to ask them to get hold of their driver to give him the right directions.  After far too many excuses, empty promises of the driver being there soon and too many \"don't know what to tell you...blah blah blah\" got a call from the driver.  Had to tell him several times how to get there and he still passed the driveway 3 times (was waiting outside for him by this time).
By the time we got our order, 1 hr & 40 minutes had passed.  Needless to say, the 'food' was cold.  WORST Greek food we've ever eaten...skinny, scant, dry chicken kabob was carelessly thrown on top of the salad and pita making the chicken grosser and the pita soggy.  My lamb wrap was soggy, the meat was scant & tasted gross, barely any tzaziki on it but even the extra tzaziki was runny and...gross.  The extra pita was clearly microwaved as it was hard like from a microwave and wtf was that powder stuff on it???  Tasted like powdered parmesan cheese.  
ALL of it was just G R O S S.  We threw out 3/4 of it...not edible by any stretch of the imagination.
What could the store manager have done instead of giving a bunch of useless excuses???  Given us a credit would have been nice. Sad...just really, really sad."}
{"text":"This restaurant's ventilation was insufficient as soon as you walk in. You are overwhelmed by the grilling atmosphere in the whole restaurant. We had a pork and chicken plate and calamari. The chicken was very dry and same with the pork. The salad and rice were very bland. The calamari was mediocre as well. I don't think I will be goings back to this restaurant anytime soon......."}
