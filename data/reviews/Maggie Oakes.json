{"text":"While in Montreal we were looking for a nice restaurant with more upscale cuisine, a decent wine list and outdoor seating. We looked around for what seemed forever and happened upon Maggie Oakes in Old Montreal. We were more than pleasantly surprised! We were seated by a very friendly hostess and served by Michelle who was friendly, efficient and made some recommendations that were spot on. Try the pork chops! They were amazing! 
We loved this place so much we returned for a second time the night after and were assisted by Gaël who was also super friendly, attentive and efficient. We also learned that this place was new but it truly seemed like this place was opened for years.
So if you're in Montreal you will not be disappointed with Maggie Oaks. Il est un excellent restaurant!"}
{"text":"Lovely outdoor patio scene on the square for people-watching. Service was prompt but did not interfere. Food was creative and enjoyable. Would also be a lovely spot to sip wine and appetizers."}
{"text":"Place was extremely busy so we sat at the bar. Food was really excellent. I had Arctic char appetizer and duck breast entree. Servers were very upbeat and attentive. Location is right near heart of old port and a bit touristy but cannot argue with quality of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The waitresses are friendly.  The kitchen is SUPER MEGA RIDICULOUSLY SLOW. (Takes forever).  The food is not out of this world."}
{"text":"Great meal at Maggie Oakes. The duck was especially tasty. Ask for Michelle P to be your server. She was on top of everything without hovering. Knowledgeable and caring. We have food allergies Michelle was very conscientious."}
{"text":"Food was good once it arrived but 75 minutes to wait for steak is pushing it.
Service was non-existant, and then waited another 20 minutes for the meat to cook as it was requested.  Never asked if we would like coffee or dessert.  There are just too many fine places to dine in this city.  They better improve or they won't be around long ."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love! This place is amazing and not for the meat shy. Beautiful interior and a wide open patio space. There's a large airing room for the beef to allow for a perfectly tender 35 day agreed steak. 

We didn't have starters aa we are advised that the portions were not French . We shared a dish of olives and had the house bread. The olives were marinated in Orange and rosemary and were very tasty.

To the main event... The steak. We all had a NY striploin. Medium rare with red wine demiglace. It was divine. They do not provide steak knives and they are not needed. The steak was so tender and moist. It came with veggies and we opted for fingerling potatoes. Delicious. We rounded off by splitting two desserts Between 4. A Chocolate raspberry combo and the most amazing lemon and chocolate tart. The espresso was a perfect compliment. 

This place is not cheap. But the attentive waiter gael made this occasion feel special. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tuna tartare was the worst we have ever tried. Very pricey for what you get. Wouldn't recommend as the menu options are limited and not great for grabbing a snack and drinks."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  It's part of the William Grey Hotel.  Beautiful location in the heart of old Montreal.  But guys this is about the food:

Had a glass of Aussie Chardonnay, beet salad and goat cheese and the veal short ribs.

To be fair, it was ok tasting.  

But

Beets were very cold making the melted cheese hard.  Goat cheese and beets- a classic seemed like they just took it out of the fridge and put microwaved goat cheese on top.  The veal presentation was really amateurish.  It was just pilled on.  Plenty of sinew and fat as well- a sign that it could have used an hour or more of cooking. The sauce was breaking.  The meat which I assume was sous-vide was tough and could have used a little broiler or heat to give it some browning just at the end...  just use google and look for plating short ribs and you'll see what a true high end restaurant can do.

For Montreal and at these prices which are middle of the road I would say find yourself something great.  The city is full of amazing restaurants- don't settle."}
{"text":"Lors de mon passage, le service fut excellent mais la qualité de la nourriture n'était vraiment pas à la hauteur du prix payé. Le sandwich boucanier était rien de plus que ce qu'on peut trouver dans un petit café bien ordinaire pour la moitié du prix."}
{"text":"Solid food choice. The environment is a little cold, but the food is very good. The foie gras was amazing and it's a rare place that doesn't skimp on the hollandaise sauce with the eggs Benedict. A little expensive for what it is, but good food nonetheless."}
{"text":"We had the NY strip steak and were very happy.  The music was a bit loud and clubbish which was not want we were expecting.  Otherwise, a nice dinner"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high but this place was totally \"meh\". 

I went with a friend on a slow Sunday night yet our drinks took nearly 20 minutes to come out. We had the bone marrow and salmon tartar to start and both were passable but kind of bland. I had the bavette steak with fries as my main. The portion size was far from generous - especially compared to other classic Montreal restaurants (L'Express for example). My steak was overcooked and the fries were limp and oily. If you're planning on going I would avoid ordering that dish.

The highlight of Maggie Oaks is definitely the decor. It's a lovely looking restaurant and gets a few points for this."}
{"text":"On a sunny summer afternoon, I was waiting with my kids to get their portraits drawn when I glanced over at this place and saw an empty table outside, right next to the action. I knew I'd be there for a while so my wife and I figured why not grab a drink while we wait. One drink turned into two and then three. Mainly due to the fact that our waiter, John, was absolutely outstanding. He was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. As my wife slowly developed a crush on him, I remarked at one point that \"he is literally the best waiter I've ever had.\"

We probably spent a couple hours there, enjoying this scene and relaxing. Eventually we wandered on, but before we did John helped us make reservations for later that evening inside, and I'm glad we did. Inside is very upscale and spendy which made me nervous: I've been burned before by fancy places with average food. But all doubts were removed when I took my first bite of the gnocchi. Oh my god. Meanwhile my wife ate a 35 day aged steak and the kids had mini burgers. All we're great. 

They probably aren't the right place to grab a quick bite, but if you have some time to spend a good meal then this is the place to go. We ended up dropping some pretty big coin, but it was worth it. And they made us feel right at home despite our flip-flops and shorts."}
{"text":"Always amazing food when we go here the burger is amazing as is the salad!! AAA+ everything is very fresh you can tell the ingredients are and the coffee is great too! Coupled with shops in the back it is awesome!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Cold food needed to be sent back on many occasions. Bad representation of Montreal food. Stick to gems in the mile end or plateau. Upscale ambiance and underwhelming food."}
{"text":"Great breakfast on the patio. I had the basic breakfast with potatoes, eggs, beans, toast, sausage, bacon, etc. My wife had the vegetarian Benedict. Both meals were fantastic, and came out in a reasonable time. Clearly the restaurant was new, and there were a few very minor kinks we witnessed (seems like most people, including us, were waiting a while for their toast). Our server was very sweet, and it was a great overall experience. Lots of room inside and out, very good food, nice service, and a good value."}
{"text":"Maggie Oakes is a lovely restaurant. Semi-casual, with a great variety of food. Their daily soups are light and tasty, and the burger are also delicious. Normally Brie on anything is pretty damn good! I first visited here during Igloofest when they had a special set menu. I had duck, and wow was it ever delicious. Melting on my tongue with each bite. If you see duck on the menu, eat it and thank me later. Side note, their desserts are different from the usual fare and rather tasty."}
{"text":"Menu is a bit limited. The beet salad was good but not spectacular. Also had the smoked trout. Very tasty although accompanying salad was bland."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant by mistake, but we were thrilled with the result. My wife and I were in Montreal for a week and ate at many of the nicer restaurants, and this restaurant was the best of the best. 

The atmosphere is excellent, they have a clear dry-aging station that is at the entrance to the restaurant. The meat looked as fantastic as it tasted. Across from the meats is a very large wine cellar that set the ambiance. 

One of the most impressive features is their herb wall garden. All the herbs in drinks and dishes are cut from the herb wall minutes before they are added to the dish. Having fresh cut basil in my drinks was a pleasant surprise. 

Come eat at this restaurant ASAP. I promise you that in no time, it will be hard to get a reservation and prices will most likely rise. 

Ask for Gael, he really took care of us and added to the experience."}
{"text":"My first visit here was dinner with my foodie group. We were a party of 10 and were seated near the glass casing of cured meats. The atmosphere is open and cozy at the same time. I enjoyed the \"wall of herbs\" located on the northern wall. It looks like part of the décor, but it has actual herbs such as parsley and cilantro. The washrooms are located in the hotel section of Hotel William Grey. I noticed there is a boutique, cafe and terrasse.  

I ordered beet salad with goat cheese and the  sweet potato manicotti with a nice red pasta sauce. They were both light and fresh which is what I was looking for since I did not want a heavy meal. 

From the very start, we received excellent customer service. Our waiter, Maxime was extremely attentive, helpful and accommodating. We never felt rushed to finish our meal. The group ordered cocktails which they seemed to enjoy. In the end, Maxime brought our table complementary Prosecco which was a lovely gesture."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place. We went for brunch on a sunday. The place looks beautiful, but i was really surprised the food was Allo Mon Coco style, but for double the price. For 20$, its 2 eggs with the cheapest sausage ever, some potatoes and beans. For a fancy breakfast this is  not acceptable. The service was very slow, and they also made some mistakes on the bill(they looked stressed and overworked) (they made a mistake for the table next to us also). Not enough staff for the amount of people in the summer( sad )
Overall, save your money its just eggs and sausage (lol)"}
{"text":"Their beef stew with gnocchi was the most delicious beef stew I've ever head! Yum! Get it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Everything tasted delicious from the cocktails to the lemonade ordered for my kids.  This restaurant has a fancier feel but we braved it anyway with our two kids along with our friends and their son (1,2 and 5).  The service was warm, welcoming yet very slow.  We weren't in a hurry so it worked out well but that would bother some.  The reason I am giving 5 stars despite the slow service is that they were extremely welcoming to my kids and accommodated our strollers, etc. (And I know they just opened last week)."}
{"text":"I was incredibly impressed with Maggie Oakes. My server, Max, was very friendly and attentive, and did not steer me wrong. On Max's suggestion I ordered the Almost Famous cocktail, a refreshing mix of Prosecco and cantaloupe with a sprig of mint, as well as a house salad to start. Both were delicious. For my entree I ordered the half roasted chicken, served atop a medley of roasted Brussels sprouts, squash, carrots and potatoes, and was not disappointed. Overall it was a wonderful meal, and I told Max not to be surprised if he saw me again during my trip!"}
{"text":"Grâce au Happening Gourmand j'ai découvert Maggie Oakes, qui siègeait sur ma liste de restaurants à découvrir depuis belle lurette. J'ai choisi le brunch Phily. Je dois avouer que c'était pas mal, l'oeuf bénédictine assaisonné et recouvert de morceaux de steak accompagné d'un bagel. C'est différent. Cela m'a beaucoup plus. L'assiette de fruits aurait peut-être pu attendre un printemps de plus, je dois dire que les fruits étaient un tantinet dur. Par contre, les scones au pépites de chocolat au lait, vraiment pas mal. La déco est moderne chic et cela me plait beaucoup. Je reviendrai explorer la carte du dîner! #HappySunday #HappeningGourmand. :)"}
{"text":"Located right off the main strip, location is key. Service was a bit confused at first but gradually got better. Which was probably due to It being 85 outside at 9pm and the restaurant was probably 78 inside. Hot night, air conditioner felt stressed and very light. 

Had to try the Fois Gras, the Buratta, and onion soup and a beer. Fois Gras was a good a d great introduction to something new, Onion Soup was different but enjoyable, Buratta was bland. Beer could have been colder. 

Food was just okay, service was just okay, atmosphere was stress due to the heat. For the price, atmosphere and location I was expecting a bit more showmanship."}
{"text":"Food was very good but service was some of the slowest I have experienced. Took 10 minutes to be greeted at the table. Another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive. And then for 2 people to receive food 40 minutes. After eating we waited another 20 minutes to be checked on and to receive the check."}
{"text":"Honnêtement ne perdez pas votre temps avec ce restaurant ! Les prix sont beaucoup trop haut pour la qualité des plats et les portions sont minuscules. J'ai goûté au carré d'agneau, le gout etait bon, mais la portion etait de la même grosseur qu'une entrée ! J'ai été manger à un autre endroit après mon repas, car j'avais trop faim. 

Le restaurant est beau et le service etait bon, mais je trouve cela inacceptable de faire payer un prix aussi haut pour des plats médiocres. 

Avec le nombres de restaurants qu'il y a dans le vieux port faite quelques pas de plus et vous en aurez beaucoup plus pour votre argent."}
{"text":"Maggie Oakes provided us with tasty food, good service, and a great location. 

The Food: 
Both I and the person I was with had The Boucanier sandwich and the kitchen nailed it. I had the house salad for a side and it was great, and the other side was fries and were tasty. Good for the price paid.

Service:
Attentive and friendly. The waiter offered for us to move tables to a better spot because our table was a bit wobbly, and that was an extremely nice touch. 

Bottom Line:
I've seen a few bad reviews on here for this location, but our experience was very good. If they can consistently perform as they did today with good food and attentive service, I would be happy to recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Service is subpar. It took them an hour and 15 minutes to get us our food. We were seated outside and there wasn't enough waiters to serve the area it seems. Food was cold (I had the Arctic char). There is some room for improvement but wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"Pretty good. No complaints. Had a good gnocci. Everyone at the table was happy with their food but not so ecstatic that we need to go back. Great location. Nice service."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, great service, amazing food and Cocktails. Both my husband and I ordered different fish dishes and we were speechless. Fish was perfect and vegetables And puree served with it were very tasty and delicious. I will crave this food a lot. We also tried their oysters which were fresh and yummy with an amazing vinegar sauce"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last weekend as I saw that it was part of the Happening Gourmand. We weren't sure if we would order from the special menu but I am so glad that we did! I started with the butternut squash soup which included a crab salad in the middle, with herbs and a spicy tomato-based drizzle. I was surprised at the balance of flavors. My main course was a simple grilled char fillet with lentils, some grilled vegetables, and ratatouille. The fish was the highlight, although I found it just a touch over-done for my tastes. For dessert, I had the chocolate and hazelnut cake, with a thick, fudgey interior. I was too full to finish the plate, but it was also surprisingly good. While not the standard menu, I wouldn't hesitate to visit again if in the area; it's more than your standard hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to this resto in late September with a group. Great food and outstanding service ! Each dish was wonderfully presented and tasted out of this world.  Would definitely recommend. Gorgeous ambiance."}
{"text":"Maggie Oakes is a restaurant nestled in the new trendy hotel William Gray in the Old Port. The space is simply spectacular- bright colourful furniture mixed with marble and gold accents turned this former food court (sorry, Valentine's has left the building) into a modern yet cozy space. Fresh micro herbs adorn an entire wall close to the cold room and wine cellar. It's evident much care, thought and money have gone into creating Maggie Oakes.

We were excited to try the food, hoping it'd be as delicious as the restaurant was visually pleasant. For starters, we tried the sweet potato soup, house-made Terrine and apple cider vinaigrette salad. They tasted good but nothing special. For our mains, we shared the lamb ragout cavatelli and half-roasted chicken. The sauce in the pasta dish was deep in flavour and the meat so tender! The chef even added some okra which gave some needed texture to the plate. The chicken held its own and was well-seasoned. 

We were pretty happy with the food at this point. But the desserts were the highlight. We tried the Paris Brest, Yuzu tart and chocolate fondant. The shortbread tart crust was perfectly buttery and crunchy. The thin layer of rich chocolate ganache provided a nice balance to the acidic lemon flavour. I'd come back post-dinner just for that tart. And maybe a glass of wine.

Beyond the food, the service was excellent and would have deserved 5 stars on its own. 

My only tiny criticism would be that the cocktails were not as good as the rest of the meal. I had the Mai Tai Coco which tasted like a bland mix of ice and alcohol with a hint of coco. Next time I'll stick to wine."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner on our one night in Montreal, and we definitely picked the right place!
Apparently it just opened, but you wouldn't know it! It has a great atmosphere and great service. 
But the real highlight was the food. 
The pea soup was delicious and a perfect way to start the meal. There were so many things I wanted on the menu it was hard to choose! I got the Cavatelli with Lamb Ragout, and it was divine. The lamb ragout was so amazingly delicious with such a fullness of flavor!
My husband got the pork on grits. I tried a bite of his and it was delicious as well. 
We were so happy with this restaurant and would recommend it as a must-stop when visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"Upon being seated, we found out they had a MTL table event (I assume it's similar to winterlicious for the Toronto folks).  So we ordered from the 3 course menu.  I had the beet soup which was decent while the wife had the salmon salad which was spectacular.  For the main, we had the monkfish and the 3 cheese eggplant.  It was very flavorful (though the fish was a bit on the salty side).

Overall a good dining experience and worth a try"}
{"text":"Excellent food and wonderful service! My fiancé and I are visiting from Philadelphia and wanted to try French-Canadian cuisine; we were not disappointed. The duck breast in demi-glacé and roasted vegetables were so juicy and savory. The bulleit burger was really tasty with a soft cheese from Quebec called La Sauvagine. I recommend the fondant chocolat for dessert as well!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is nice, food wasn't bad but the service went from good to ok to not great. The food took
Forever! it was made worse when our server kept telling us it would be right there but it took a lot longer to come out. I don't know if this is a usual thing or not...Everyone was very nice & we had our 1 year old with us and everyone was great with her, except the food issue. If you're starving maybe not the best choice, if you don't mind waiting, it's fine."}
{"text":"There are unfortunately times when a restaurant holds much promise, but fails on one key element.  So it was at this place when we dined there one Friday evening. The food was pretty good. . The service was not. Perhaps I should have seen it coming and bailed early when it took 10 minutes for Miguel to take our initial drink order, and then an annoying 15+ minutes for those drinks to be delivered. But it never got better. . Or appetizers were very slow,  and included being brought the wrong appetizers,  sending them back, and then, amazingly, a while later being brought one correct and, again, one of the same incorrect appetizers.  Entrees took forever. Coffee...well, jokes about growing the beans were only a little funny.

I appreciate not being pushed along,  but leisurely is not the same as slow and inept. I hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Came here today at around 11 AM. Restaurant was pretty full and service was good. Food is kind of overrated but no complains. I got the grilled cheese sandwich with potatoes that tasted good but nothing special and my girlfriend got pan cakes and she said it was one of the best she tried in a while. Would recommend going there for early breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Situated in the center of old Montreal, at \" la place Jacques Cartier \", this is a good restaurant. 
Like I said, it's in the old Montreal so obviously expect it to be expensive meal. 

I had their oysters as appetizers; they were meaty and fresh. I had their rack of lamb as the main course, medium rare. It was delicious. The lamb was cooked to perfection, the meat is juicy and tender. It came with some veggies that are well seasoned and a smooth sauce to go with the meal. The presentation was excellent, at the price you're paying I think it's the least they can do but they did it well. 
Super friendly waitress, always helpful, calm and happy. We never felt rushed.

It is a fancy restaurant; once summer ever comes (looking at you Mother Nature) their terrace must be very charming. I just love the Old Montreal for that."}
{"text":"While on vacation, I ate twice at Maggie Oaks, out of convenience and for the oysters. Other restaurants I had tried lived by the moto: The blander the better. 
Service on my first visit was slow and the second visit nearly non-existent. In one hour, we had our small water glasses filled twice. Both sat empty for a majority of the meal. 
Besides the oysters, the tuna tataki is a pleasant starter. 
Veal is usually a tender choice of meat. However, this poor calf must have trained for the marathon as the short ribs I had were tough as shoe leather.  When the server came and asked if everything was pleasant and tender I quiet literally could not answer because I was having difficulty swallowing. He didn't wait around for me to answer nor to see the outcome. 
My dining partner had the duck which was fair. Despite the hot plate, the food was below room temperature. 
The meal on the second visit consisted of the eight-ounce tenderloin. While cooked properly, the food was cold. The spot of garlic mashed potatoes had little if any garlic. The foie gras seemed to be missing from the demiglace.    
My partner chose fettuccini with black truffles at his next meal. After he complained I tried it. An out of balance dish, aggressively filled with black nicoise olives, there was no point to the black truffles at an extra 9 dollars.     
They treat their vegetables worse than a red-headed stepchild. All three of the meat dishes had the same mélange of three haricot verts, one asparagus spear, sliced zucchini each over cooked. Additionally, a fleurette each of cauliflower and broccoli were nearly raw as was the clunky, half a red bell pepper that saw a hot pan for less than ten seconds. With exception of the oysters, proper seasoning was a problem with every dish."}
{"text":"They have a nice terrasse on the iconic Jacques-Cartier square. Service was good, the waitress was always available, even though food came late. 
We had a breakfast, which had a fancy name, but not that great taste, I chose the terroir; two eggs, bacon, sausages, baked beans, roasted potatoes, creton, homemade jams, fresh fruits and variety of toast. The homemade jam is tasty with their bread.
Their coffee was average."}
{"text":"This is a recently open restaurant and hotel in the heart of old Montreal. Plentyfull because the portions are very satisfying, delicious because, well, it is! For appetizer we had the Bone marrow and the Bison tartare. For dinner we had the Pork chops (a must try, very juicy) and the poisson. Our server Gael was very helpful and jovial, speaking at least three language. We also had the opportunity to meet the owner, very nice and approachable person. A must try place."}
{"text":"Very nice food, tho our server was pretty aloof until we started to chat him up.
Fresh pea soup, sweet potato manicotti, pork chop all cooked perfectly as they should be at a premium price.
What you would expect at a fine restaurant in a major city."}
{"text":"Located in the William Grey Hotel, you'd imagine the service would be better. We would almost say the waitress was borderline agitated before we sat down. 

We ordered the porterhouse for two at a steeping price of 110. However, it generously came with two sides and we had leftovers to take home. It was 32 oz if I recall correctly. We requested medium rare but it came out leaning towards the cook side of medium rare. (Lost a star there). The two sides we picked were fries and mushrooms, under the recommendations of our waitress. It was mediocre. 

The appetizers was entirely a different story. We ordered the bison tartar and it was delicious. 

I wouldn't say this was the best restaurant in town but it wasn't bad. Definitely have been to better steakhouse."}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch stop. I was impressed with the service and the food. Good all around!"}
{"text":"Visited this resto with a group of friends on a weekday during the Happening Gourmand festival which gives you three courses at a reduced price. 
We were warmly welcomed and seated on a long high table; the restaurant is very nicely decorated, modern and sleek with comfortable seating and lighting. Really like the herb wall in the back too. 

The table d'hôte menu had some great choices for the price; I opted for the duck tartare entree, the cavatelli pasta as my main, and the raspberry cheesecake for dessert. I really didn't enjoy the tartare as I found it lacked flavour; the texture was great as was the presentation but it could have used some oomph. The pasta dish however was outstanding! Perfectly cooked pasta with a great creamy and flavourful sauce; definitely one of the best pasta dishes I've had. The cheesecake was good, nice texture but I would have preferred some tartness to the raspberry coulis or mousse as I found the whole plate just sweet and had no play on flavours. Overall, the meal was okay, especially for the price. 

The service was excellent as the staff was very friendly and well versed in their recommendations for wine pairing. 

Overall, the night was good. A beautiful restaurant with great service, they might want to up their dishes a little to make them great."}
{"text":"Touristy. I'm from Mtl and this is a great location BUT not much really authentic- the bagel tasted frozen; probably wasn't but absolutely NOT a traditional Montreal bagel. My husband got toast- -limp, dry and by the time the jam came- it was cold. Normally this stuff doesn't bother me but in a city like Montreal, the baked products should be stellar. 
Service was slow. Clearly they had some staffing issues- happens to all restaurants. They were working really hard."}
{"text":"Great ingredients, taste, drinks, and hospitality! They were able to accommodate our large business group TWICE (first 10 and second 25, separate days); we just made reservations about 5 hours prior."}
{"text":"Shared the porterhouse steak with my wife. One of the best steaks I've had in a longtime. My son got the 12oz sirloin and loved it. The oysters were average but still good."}
{"text":"The restaurant opened some time in mid 2016 and so the interior decor are all modern and new. It is spacious, with many tables, so each table can be assured of having its \"personal\" space most of the time. 

We ordered different steaks. I had the rib steak (16oz) which was excellent. I like my steak slightly charred on the outside, hence with a smoky flavor, and not too salty. Maggie Oakes hit all the high notes for me."}
{"text":"Good food. Terrible service- extremely slow. Spent 3 hours there outside in the cold waitin for our food and even to get served with water at the beginning. Shared the same view with another table of patrons."}
{"text":"Great dining experience in Montreal! Our server Gael made excellent recommendations for menu choices and everything we ordered was very well prepared and presented.  All of wait staff is very attentive.  Glad we picked Maggie Oakes for dinner."}
{"text":"I don't typically spend the time writing reviews, however, I had such a bad experience at this restaurant I felt compelled. After being sent to Maggie Oakes by my hotel concierge (Auberge), I decided to try it. I walked in and asked for a table on the terrace. Hostess stated they were clearing a table and would be seated shortly. I went to the bar to order a glass of wine while I waited. After sitting at the bar for 20 min and observed 3 different tables being seated before me, I asked the hostess why I had not been seated......she stated BECAUSE YOU ARE A SINGLE PERSON. She stated she had to seat parties greater than one person first. Then she proceeded to defend herself instead of apologizing and immediately searing me. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? 
This day and age, this should not be happening. If you are a single female traveling for business or pleasure, DO NOT BOTHER going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tellement, mais tellement décevant! J'ai très mal mangé et pour avoir aussi mal mangé, j'ai payé 170$. C'est vraiment du vol. Les plats manquent de goût (ou n'en n'ont pas du tout), les portions sont ridicules (je ne mange pas beaucoup et pourant on est allé se chercher une pizza après), les aliments ne sont pas frais, bref, tout est une grosse déception. Ne prenez surtout pas la pieuvre grillée, je n'en reviens encore pas qu'ils servent ce plat! C'est une portion d'entrée et même encore! 

Bref, n'y allez pas. Il y a tellement plein de bons restaurants dans le coin pour bien moins cher : Barroco, Quattro, La champagnerie, etc."}
{"text":"After looking through the picks of Happening Gourmand, we decided on Maggie Oakes because their menu looked the most impressive. I started with the onion soup which wasn't traditionally gratinée bit was delicious none the less (deep but mellow flavour with mini blocks of oka cheese which was gooey goodness). My main was the duck which was served medium rare and had a beautiful smokey flavour and Whatever that purée was on my plate was so flipping yummy! Desert was ice cream and chocolate fondant which I give two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner here with my wife while on a short trip to Montreal.

We had walked around for a bit looking for a nice place to eat and were enticed by a tasty sounding menu and al fresco dining.  From the start the service was pretty terrible.  The couple we were seated next to had already sent back their entrees (not a promising sign....should have gotten up then).

My first interaction with our waiter was on the beer list.  I asked him what was local and he pointed out a \"red beer\".  When I asked him what style it was he said a \"red/brown beer\".  Okay then.  So I ordered a local lager to be safe even though I wanted something a bit more interesting.

We ordered and our appetizers came.  I had a prawn salad that was tasty and my wife had a peach and quinoa salad that was also good (and quite large).  There was no salt/pepper on the table.   Still optimistic.

Entrees come.  My steak frites is supposed to be flank steak done medium rare.  Not even close.  Steak has no seasoning and is tasteless.  Homemade ketchup tastes like water mixed with tomato paste.  Wife's grilled octopus is cooked well but smothered in a disgusting barbecue sauce.

Didn't waste time trying dessert.  If you are going to go here try the roof deck and get a drink or two.  Pretty terrible for a $100+ USD meal."}
{"text":"Sunday, May 28 my family and I received the most horrible service imaginable by a hostess who made us wait 20 minutes for a table even though more than half the restaurant was empty. When we asked about being seated after the 20 minutes had elapsed, she rudely told us that we wouldn't be able to eat there at all because they had exceeded their walk in limit. THE RESTAURANT WAS MORE THAN HALF EMPTY!! And I had just watched them seat a couple who had just walked in without reservations. 

I told her that we didn't appreciate them wasting our time and promising us a table if there was never an intention of us being seated, would it have hurt them to tell us beforehand? She saw we were visibly upset over their unprofessional treatment so her way of resolving the issue was offering us 1 free beer, at the bar, not a table, like that was going to make up for our having wasted our time. We walked out immediately and took our money, and business elsewhere. 

If you value a professional atmosphere, and quality customer service; Don't waste your time or your money here."}
{"text":"Best bartenders in Montreal!
Hard to find women that can make a great drink, have a good conversation with you, and also have a really attractive lip ring. Highly recommend this bar when lip ring bartenders (I don't know their real names because I think they were messing with me, but that was part of the fun) are the ones running the show."}

{"text":". I'll admit it up front, Maggie Oakes was,not my first choice for dinner on a Saturday night in Montreal, so the fact that we found ourselves there was just a stroke of really, really good fortune.

The location on Place Jacques-Cartier is really great.  Don't be concerned with its proximity to Ben and Jerry's and Old Montréal's ubiquitous tee-shirt shops.  What was a great location in April has yo even better in the summer months.  

Inside is sleek and modern without pretense. Our service was fantastic; our waiter (Max?) helped us with the menu and made some great recommendations. A charcuterie appetizer and its cheeseboard friend both offered some Quebec offerings I may not be able to find at home, so it was a good start.  We had a 60 oz bone-in steak prepared for five (off the menu and worth asking if they can do it for you). The beef was amazing and the accompanying vegetables and potatoes could have stood on their own. The wine and beer lists are diverse and priced well."}
{"text":"The food in this place was very below average.  I ordered the Israeli Couscous salad and was like eating a pasta dish.  I'm not even sure you can call a salad a salad when it has 3-5 kale chips and 99% is a pea size couscous."}
{"text":"Ouch. Such high hopes. Lovely friendly hostess. Then downhill after that. 15 minutes to get a glass of water. 10 more for someone to take a drink order. Whereupon I let the waiter know in a nice way we were becoming impatient.  Two tables to the left they gave up and walked out menus still on the table. They had arrived before us. Another 20 and no drink we walked out.

{"text":"Un restaurant sur la Place Jacques Cartier est souvent synonyme de piètre qualité, de restauration rapide et de service pas super. Et bien laissez moi vous dire que le Maggie Oakes se démarque du lot. Situé dans le superbe nouvel hotel William Gray il épate tant par son service, son cadre intimiste et par la fraîcheur et la qualité de la nourriture. J'y suis allée un lundi soir avec une amie, je m'attendais donc à ce que ce soit calme et tant mieux pour nous, les serveurs étaient aux petits soins. Tout sur la carte semblait alléchant et à des prix raisonnables pour le lieu (oui nettement plus cher que la petite baraque à côté, mais rien à voir côté saveur et elaboration du plat!!). Le plat de ribs servi avec une sauce à l'érable, une purée de pommes de terre et légumes sautés était à tomber par terre. Je n'ai absolument rien  laissé dans mon plat. Chaque légume était savoureux et frais du marché. Tu veux te rappeler le vrai goût de la carotte ben tu vas là en gros :D Le fondant au chocolat nous a toutes les deux ravis, chaud, pas trop amer et cuit juste à point. J'ai aimé particulièrement le cadre, tellement une belle salle: spacieuse, parfaite pour les groupes, aux couleurs chaudes, avec en plus une murale végétale ou ils prennent leurs épices. Non mais si t'es pas conquis je n'y comprends rien :) Parfait pour les soirées entre amis, pour un anniversaire et aussi pour un rendez-vous galant. On s'entend parler et la musique ne vient pas couvrir les conversations."}
{"text":"Went here with my family for my graduation dinner. The food was fantastic! We ordered the steak with a few sides and appetizers, which were all satisfying. The portion is very reasonable, nothing like the \"bougie\" places with tiny portions. Service was a bit slow, especially when we came it was not busy at all, but the food was worth the wait! would recommend for special occasions, fancy date nights or whenever you feel sleek and chic!"}
{"text":"One of the best Oysters in Montreal. 
The cocktail bar and wine selection is good. 
Great location for a date. 

Pricing is good in terms of a high end restaurant. 
Prime location as well. 
Overall service is great."}
{"text":"I came here with my two brothers during the holidays. We shared the bison tartare entree and the tomahawk for two. The bison was delicious. One brother never had bison tartare before and he loved it.The tomahawk for two is quite big and sharing it between three people was perfect. It came with two sides so we picked french fries and mushrooms. The steak was cooked just right. Frankly, it wasn't the best steak I've ever had but it was quite good. We got to pick two sauces so we picked the red wine demi-glace and the green tomato chimichurri. I preferred the latter but both were good. We were all so full afterwards that we didn't order dessert despite the reviews here on yelp stating that the desserts are fabulous and a must try. Oh well there's always next time and we preferred to go somewhere else for cocktails  and drink our calories. ;)"}
{"text":"Plutôt décevant comme expérience. Nous étions un groupe de 7 et tout le monde est sorti déçu. Plusieurs avaient encore faim puisque les assiettes sont petites. Je ne recommanderais pas cette place à d'autres. Beaucoup trop cher pour la grosseur et la qualité des assiettes. Heureusement j'avais commandé la bavette qui était bien et de bon format. Ne commandez pas le carré d'agneau parce que c'est petiiiiiiiit!"}
{"text":"Si vous cherchez un restaurant pour le petit-déjeuner dans le Vieux-Port de Montréal, qui ouvre à 6h30am, tous les jours, Maggie Oakes est bien désigné pour. Il fait parti de l'hôtel William Gray. C'est un beau restaurant de qualité sur la Place Jacques-Cartier contrairement aux autres attrapes touristes dans le coin. Il sert donc des petits déjeuner tôt, ce qui est rare dans ce coin du Vieux-Montréal qui est habituellement désertique mais aussi en après-midi/soirée sert des grillades/steaks qui est sa spécialité. Qui dit restaurant d'hôtel dit, prix un peu plus cher qu'ailleurs mais la qualité est là. Ma copine a pris le bénédictine saumon fumé (15$), moi Le Terroir (19$) + 2 américanos (7,50$), plus taxes/pourboire = 54,22$. Le service de la serveuse était très professionnel avec sourire. La décoration était belle avec son magnifique mur végétal, quoi que la luminosité était un peu sombre. Si vous voulez déjeuner/brunchez autrement dans un lieu de qualité dans le Vieux-Montréal, je pense que vous allez aimer ce lieu.

{"text":"Went for breakfast,  food was good but waiter was inattentive, plate was cold and had to ask twice for my coffee. Maybe a one-off, the other service seemed to be hustling."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this review is not based on a meal here but solely on the interaction with the hostess. Maggie Oakes managers and owners need to give a few guidelines to their staff as to how to properly great and answer their patrons.
Showed up around 9:30, without a reservation (OpenTable was showing multiple openings for 9:30-9:45 and 10pm) only to get turned away saying they were fully booked for the evening. When I pointed out the possibility of making a reservation on the spot via OpenTable, a stream of condescending attitude and the shitty excuse of \"the kitchen is backed up, we are not sitting anyone\" came up. Since when does the kitchen dictate your seating? And are you saying you're not fully booked anymore? Mind you, about a third of the restaurant was empty. 
There is a way to turn clients away politely but having a disrespectful hostess is a foolproof way to never see my money spent there."}
{"text":"A nice location for just the wife and me tonight. This was their first week being open and other than our waiter not having everything memorized there was no indication they weren't firing on all cylinders.

I had the striploin steak medium rare which was exactly what we put in front of me. The demi place was delicious and the vegetable were perfectly done.

Our waiter was extremely attentive and professional. While we are far from local to Montreal this seems to be a very nice addition to the area.

We skipped desert but if the main courses was sent judge they are probably extremely good."}
{"text":"This place was beautiful with a lovely ambience located in the heart of Montreal. This is my first time visiting this restaurant and I would definitely recommend it. Want to give a big thank you to our server Jonathan who was extra attentive and caring."}
{"text":"I hate to do this, because I think this restaurant has a lot of potential, but someone needs to wake up the kitchen team working Sunday brunch, because they committed more than a few faux pas. I do want to mention that our server, though perhaps a little green, was generous, good-humored, and obviously cares a great deal about her clients. The manager on duty, for his part, took care to be visible on the floor, and did his best to rectify the issue that was brought to his attention.

However, the restaurant was practically empty, and the only issue they knew about was the one I finally brought up to the server after we had finished eating when she came to clear our plates. None of us were asked during our meal if everything was all right, and we were not asked after our first course if we had enjoyed it. Whether she asked or not after the second course, by that time I felt I had to address  the fact that there was something missing on the plate, and she apologized profusely... to the point where I felt a little uncomfortable and wished I hadn't said anything. The manager was kind enough to comp that plate, and that was beyond what I expected, but it was the least offensive thing that had occured.

The issues that weren't addressed:

1) $18 for 6 oysters that were badly shucked - not properly cut away from the shell, full of debris, and mangled. If you are going to charge on the higher end for oysters, which I do not mind paying, then don't treat them like buck-a-shucks. $3 a oyster: treat it like the delicacy. That means telling me where it's from, and being aware of what you're putting on a plate. The fact that both the shucker and the server didn't notice or care that the oysters going out looked like garbage is what really bothers me. 

2) Mealy tomatoes. C'mon. I've never been to cooking school and I can tell a mealy tomato from the way it feels when I slice into it and the way it looks when I put it on a plate. 

Someone in your kitchen doesn't give a f***, and I'm calling them out. I get that chefs don't like to serve brunch. But there are plenty of talented and hungry people in this city who want to work, so if you don't, stop wasting all of our time. Hotel William Gray and Maggie Oakes deserve better."}
{"text":"Just okay. Service was slow and chicken was mediocre. Cheese board was great however."}
{"text":"Maggie oakes has a great atmosphere and ambience in the center of the old port at quai Jacques Cartier. I highly recommend the bone marrow appetizer, the flavors were amazing and it was a unique dish. I ordered the butternut squash linguini and the pasta was overcooked. Maggie oakes is known for their beef cuts. Our friends ordered the porterhouse and tomahawk for two and loved it. Unfortunately the kitchen was running behind and so we were all served at different time but the server gave us a round of shots on the house to apologize. Overall, I think this restaurant has alot of potential to be great especially with their excellent location."}
{"text":"Five days later and a country away, I'm still confused by how good this restaurant was. 

I mean, yes, it's pretty hard to find bad food in Montreal, but if it's anywhere it'd be in Tourist Central Old Montreal, and if there's one street that is more touristy and advisably avoided than the others, its Place Jacques-Cartier. And eating at a new restaurant inside a new hotel on Jacques-Cartier? By a chef who was a Top Chef contestant? Christ, why don't you just eat at Guy Fieri's Times Square circle of hell?

And honestly, if you have these thoughts in Old Montreal in the end of November, please continue having them. Because that increases the odds that I'll be able to snag a reservation on my yearly visit. 

Maggie Oakes was such a surprise. The food is absolutely outstanding, the service is fun, amiable, and on point, and the prices? The prices are ridiculous. 

From my starter (lamb poutine, with lamb that was so tender and flavorful my mom was eating it by the spoonful) to the dessert (small homemade pastries, each the size of a small cookie), everything was delicious. But my plat principal. Oh man, my plat principal. 

I should say that Maggie Oakes advertises 45-day dry-aged Canadian steaks, which are on display in the restaurant. [That may gross you out. It made my mom a bit queasy. Me, I saw them and thought, \"2 minutes each side and we're in business.\"] But starting at $50+ CAN, that seemed spendy. Just the sort of ridiculous overpricing you'd find at a tourist trap.

So I opted for the steak bauvette. At $24 CAN, I assumed this would be a skirt steak or some similar cheaper cut. And I hoped for the best. 

I have no idea what part of the cow made this heavenly steak, but I offer thanks to it, wholeheartedly. As large and tender as a filet, it cut like butter and was cooked to perfection: charred on the outside, bright pink on the inside - exactly what medium-rare should be. The homemade fries with house ketchup might've been amazing, too. I honestly couldn't focus on anything other than the steak. 

My dad's cavatelli with lamb was likewise delicious, and my mom's fish was perfectly cooked. And our waiter, Nicolas, was fantastic: very polite, but when we started joking with him, he instantly and comfortably joked back. We sort of wanted him to pull up a chair and give us more of that friendly Quebecois sass. 

If Maggie Oakes is Montreal's Guy Fieri, screw it, I'm moving to Canada tomorrow. 

And I may have to get one of those $60 steaks. Nicolas can share it with me. Then we'll feed each other miniature lemon meringues and raspberry financiers and chocolate truffles and YELP STOP SQUASHING MY FANTASIES"}
{"text":"January in Montreal brings forth certain ideas to mind as Montrealers. For some, it is the %$?#ing snow and all that comes with it. For those who are looking to party, January means it is Igloofest. And for those of a more food specific point of view, January means Happening Gourmand is back in the Old Port. In its 11th year, Happening Gourmand is a event run by the Antonopoulos Group where they offer a discounted table d'hôte in their 9 Old Montreal restaurants. Basically MTL à Table but only theirs. Interesting enough as it is a chance to check out some interesting spots in the Old Port at a price that you don't get to enjoy often in the Old Port. For the occasion of the birthdays of a couple of dear friends, we found ourselves at Maggie Oakes for dinner - curious what we would get for our money.

Maggie Oakes is located on a prime spot in Place Jacques-Cartier on the first floor of the William Gray boutique Hotel. It is apparently inspired by American bistros and steakhouses and strongly focuses on dry aged meats. Visually, the space is worthy of the Old Port. Very glamorous look - a mixture of marble, walnut and brass with a clear glass dry age meat cooler and wine cellar as well as a green wall where they appear to grow fresh herbs and micro-greens. The space is rather large but surprisingly wasn't too noisy despite us being present on a busy Friday night.

For Happening Gourmand, we had access to a three course meal for 31$. We could still order extra off the regular menu so we started with some fresh Raspberry point oysters. Nice, fresh and a little salty - perfect start to the night.

For starters, we tried both options available. First was a butternut squash soup served with crab salad and fresh herbs. Nice creamy texture with a surprising kick of spice to it. I really enjoyed the addition of the crab to mix. The butternut squash flavour came through nicely although I didn't get that hint of caramelized sweetness I was expecting.

Next was the smoked duck tartare with candied orange, peppers and pickled vegetables. Classic presentation and very well done overall. The duck was beautiful - its inherent fatty richness perfectly showcased here. I liked the use of the candied orange to add that nice sweetness that works so well with duck.

For mains, I first went with the handmade cavatelli served with wild mushrooms, cream sauce, tarragon and pecorino cheese. Excellent pasta dish. The pasta was cooked well and the cream sauce had the right mix of richness without being overwhelming. The mushroom added some nice earthiness and the pecorino a hint of sharpness. Very enjoyable.

My fiancé went with the slow cooking beef short ribs served with roasted Jerusalem artichokes and mashed sweet potatoes. The meat was perfectly fall off the bone good. Tender and very flavourful. The roasted veggies and the sweet mash are classic pairs with braised beef so of course they worked very well here.

For the last course, we had two options and tried both. Neither one really wowed us... especially compared to the previous courses. The raspberry cheesecake - a cream cheese mousse with vanilla, almond biscuit and raspberry confit - looked beautiful and tasted fine but didn't leave much of a mark.

The chocolate cake - a chocolate biscuit with creamy dark chocolate and cream mounted chocolate milk - came off as dry. The cream was excellent but if the base isn't solid, that doesn't really matter.

Maggie Oakes was for 2 courses out of 3 a very pleasant surprise. The quality of food as well as the quantity was excellent and made for a great meal. The dessert course brought things back down to earth but overall, I can definitely recommend Maggie Oakes if one is looking to spend a nice evening in the Old Port. You will definitely be in the heart of the action.

Cheers!"}

{"text":"Okay, I was blown away by Maggie Oakes. We actually ate at the bar outside of the restaurant. While we waited for our food, the bartender, Jason improvised drinks based on our likes. I'd say things like \"something that tastes like autumn in a cup\" and he'd craft something magical, one drink after another. Jason was the type of guy that would carry a sprig of rosemary in his apron pocket in case of emergencies. It was great. Then came the food! The bison tartare with roasted cipollini onions, lemongrass aioli, and bonito flakes was out-of-this-world. I think it might be my new response to if I had one more meal left on earth, what would I eat. The lamb ragout poutine was also incredible - elevated the Montreal favorite to a new level. I was already full, but why stop there when you're enjoying each dish so much. Seeing as the restaurant has meat in its windows, we opted for a New York steak. The steak was some of the most tender, juicy, melt-in-your-mouth I've ever had. Seriously, Maggie Oakes is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"AVOID!!! We sat at this restaurant for an hour and managed to get our two glasses of juice and an incomplete charcuterie plate. The server didn't check on us. When I finally got her attention and told her that our charcuterie plate was missing the foie gras, she questioned me like I didn't know what that was. Am I sure I didn't eat it? ...I told her I didn't want to pay $22 for a charcuterie plate that was missing it's most expensive ingredient and asked her to adjust the bill. After that, we waited another 30 minutes for our mains. We didn't end up getting them. We were charged the full price for what we did get and got little apology for everything else. If you're touring Montreal, skip this place and go just about anywhere else. We wasted so much time of our last day waiting for nothing."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant located in the William
Grey hotel in the heart of old Montreal  with great food. I ordered their butternut squash soup and had their slow cooking beef short ribs as my main and it was extremely delicious and really well marinated. I Also had their chocolate cake which was delicious. 

This review should be a four star but unfortunately the waitress was very aggressive and rude. I will assume she woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

Tip: they have a beautiful plant mural so keep that in mind when reserving. Also, make sure to pass by and play a match of pool located near the hotel bathroom."}
