{"text":"Amazing burger with pastrami, a fried yolks egg and crispy onion rings...didnt even need the bun! The fried cheese cubes and jalapeno popers were okay and my fiance said the fried fish was good but the portion was small. Sitting outdoors in their remodeled patio was great besides everyone chain smoking."}
{"text":"Good drinks, always a nice atmosphere things made the right way . Would recommend there pizzas, good pub food."}
{"text":"Not bad, your typical local bar.   They have great beer selections and the food is decent, wait staff is attentive and friendly.   I usually try and stop in when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Love the food here is always fresh the burgers and fries are awesome the ribs are super tender the waitresses and bartenders are very friendly, and they have a great mixed drink and beer selection stop in here you will really enjoy it"}
{"text":"Impeccable service all members of the staff were extremely polite and service was very quick. I had a drink in my hand before I even had to ask. The cheese balls are amazing!!! Carls tavern is the place to be in monroeville any night of the week"}
{"text":"Great staff and good beer selection. We got takeout beer for an after-party and they were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Carls is pretty much a legend in the Monroeville area, it's been there years.  I went the other night with friends for dinner and enjoyed it.

I had the Carl's Burger which is a 1/2 pound hamburger and was pleasantly surprised.  It's not a Tesaros burger but pretty good for a bar burger and reasonably priced as well.

They have a very big menu for a small bar; if you plan on going on Saturday night, come early, the dining area only has 6 booths.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice place to meet up in Wilkins with friends for cheap eats and drinks. I enjoyed a couple delicious margaritas made with fresh lemons and limes juiced to order and garlic butter whole wings. There is ample parking and a nice patio outside. One thing that would have been nice would be music."}
{"text":"Carl's Tavern is your neighborhood \"Cheers\" kind of bar.  It's full of a set of friendly locals, and it's a family run business that's been around for  \"ever\" in the Monroeville area.  If you go in during lunch, it's a quiet and nice atmosphere where you can chat with the bartenders (Brock and Russ are great) and feel at home.  If you feel like sitting at a table, they have plenty of tables in the back of the bar and you will get service back there.

Carl's is also a great place to go at nice and have a few beers and chat with those around you.  It's a very friendly set of people who go there, and there are a lot of good beers on tap.

In terms of food, the fries with cheese are a personal favorite.  The fish sandwich is also very good, and very filling.  If you have a big appetite, these are great choices."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and drinks last night. The place was full of people which we took as a good sign. We decided to sit on the patio which was very cozy for 10 degree weather. Erin was our server and she was prompt and very sweet. The food was amazing I highly suggest the tangy pork! Can't wait to return soon!"}
{"text":"I drove by Carl's tons of times and never paid any real attention to it until a friend brought me there one night. I've been back a few times since and I have to say it that it's a great little place.

If you wanna go out for the night but you don't feel like getting wild, this is a good place to go. It's just a casual and relaxed atmosphere. It's a good place to go have a few drinks and hang out with your friends. The staff is very friendly and usually the other patrons are too so don't be surprised if they strike up a conversation with you.

All in all, this is a good place to go. The food is good and cheap so you'll be set when you get the drunk munchies."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone raves about this place. The fish sandwich is just okay and the place is very small and dark. The service was good. It's bar food though. Will be back but it's not that big of a deal."}
{"text":"I been going here for the past 7 years!  I enjoy the atmosphere, the staff, and the pedestrians.  You can't go wrong with good beer, good bar food, and good conversation.  I really enjoy the Pittsburgh wings and Russ' Chili  Yummmm!! My new favorite drink is the Windex.  I know right!! Sounds dangerous... and it is... dangerously delicious!  It's what I like to call \"ADULT Juice\".  Great place to go alone or with a group of your favorite people.  Don't go with someone boring... it will ruin your experience!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Best wings ever    Buffalo garlic sauce is to die for!    From Maryland, and every time in town I have to visit and wing out!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to dine here after a work meeting recently. From the outside the place looks pretty unassuming - the building is small and painted in such a way that it doesn't stand out much from the road or gray Pittsburgh sky, and \"Carl's\" is written on it in fairly small print. You could easily drive by and totally miss it on your way to Monroeville. But once you get inside you're in for a treat, as Carl's is definitely one of the nicer bars and dining areas I've eaten in around this general area.

Their menu, while not enormous, is pretty impressive to read over - lots of appetizers, multiple sandwiches, a few pizzas, some pastas...add on their daily soups and specials and you have a surprising number of options to pick from. I didn't expect that from such a little watering hole! My coworkers and I all ended up ordering the fish sandwich due to a recommendation from a local earlier in the day. Let me tell you, this sandwich is HUGE. The slice of breaded fried fish you get on this thing is almost twice as long as the sandwich bun, and as a result some of us just ate half of the fish with tartar sauce rather than as a sandwich. The sandwiches were so big that the three of us regretted getting the two orders of fries we thought would make a good side. Not because the fries were bad, but none of us really had the room to eat many of them!

Then again, we might have eaten more fries except for a great act of generosity on the staff's part. One coworker had ordered provolone cheese on his sandwich and received American due to a mixup. The staff apologized for this and, to our surprise, brought out some amazingly delicious fried cheeseballs filled with pepperjack cheese to make up for the error. They were so fresh, they literally melted in our mouths as we ate them. We may have been full from the sandwiches but we still devoured those cheesy goodies!

Since we stopped in during the work day we didn't drink anything alcoholic, but I'd definitely consider stopping in again for a bite and a beer in the future. The food was good and the staff were excellent - that makes for a great albeit little place!"}
{"text":"The bar was very small. Thr only spot I could sit was directly behind the beer tap that takes up a significant amount of space on the bar. The patio wasn't open due to it being winter. The food was nothing special and seemed kinda small. I got a grilled cheese sandwich and I make bigger ones at home. I had to order the fries separate, again not much per portion. The bartender was great. I wish I got his name. He was personable and funny and talked to all the customers."}
{"text":"This has been one of the worst bar experiences I have ever had. So I got lack service to say the absolute least so I gave a terrible tip. Because it was reflected in the service and then the short dude bartender gave me the finger to my back. 

Can you get any classier than that?

Get a life. 

Don't go here."}
{"text":"I always told everyone that this place had the best hamburger in Pittsburgh. It was like a good, tender steak with great flavor. IMHO this place has gone way down in quality of this item. No longer is it this way. That was the only reason I came here (as I am not a local to this area) and now the reason no longer exists. Stopped in for lunch and the burger was the same tough hard to chew beef you can get at most of the cheap places. They do have a good selection of beer on tap but I can find that at several other places that have food I enjoy more. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Loved this place since the 1990's when I worked at the Mall.......we would close and go to Carls !   In all the years going here......never had a bad meal.......the food is always great.........and I have never ever, even once, had a problem here, seen an argument, a fight, nothing.......very very very nice crowd.....this is one of my favorite places to go.....lots of grrrrrrreat memories here........still miss a waitress from way back when......Sara... she passed away, she was a very sweet person, very funny.....very funny.......we just loved her...... always friendly and happy.......well, all these years later, still a great place to stop in for a bite to eat......love it....."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here twice together, but he comes more regularly without me to pick up takeout.  He knows the owners of Carls pretty well and the first time I was here, I remember not being a fan of what I ordered and on Friday when he suggested to step out and grab a couple beers and a late dinner, I was reluctant to come back.  I am glad I did though.

Carls is located right on William Penn highway  before all the car dealerships and stores.  Their outside patio is so cool, so if it isn't too packed - definitely take a seat out there!  Friday it was busy, so we chose to sit inside at the bar.  It wasn't super busy but you could tell there were a lot of locals and regulars.  We ordered two of their craft beers and I wish I remembered the name of them because they were great.  Bobby ordered a burger with fries and cheese and I got 6 whole wings with their Asian inspired bbq sauce.  The sauce was sweet and the ranch was a good way to break up the flavor. I am particular about my wings and I really enjoyed these.  They were a good size with lots of meat on them.

Winner in my book! Glad I let him talk me into another visit :)"}
{"text":"It was a tad pricier than I would have thought, but the food was really good and I liked the staff very much, except for one very loud bartender, she made it a little difficult to watch the game we went to see as she was just so loud and distracting, but otherwise, I really liked it and I'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great and service is spot on. Personal favorite is the past time burger. Definitely one of the best lunch spots in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Carl's has been here for a long time because it is just plain good food and a relaxed atmosphere. A great place for friends and family to meet and eat. From the burgers to the fish sandwich there is something for everyone. Good beer selection and specials."}
{"text":"What a fun place!

I went with a friend who lives near the bar.    The bar area is pretty small with table seating in two adjacent rooms.

The bar area has a ton of character.    The bar is a wrap around bar that probably sits about 20 people on each side.   The ends are more narrow where one end will seat about 4, while the other is used to provide drinks for servers and the entrance / exit for the bartenders.

The bartenders and staff were a ton of fun.  I had fun with my \"dealer's choice beers\".   

The food was awesome as well.   I believe I ordered a Pepperoni and Cheese Pizza (really good) and a Cheese Steak with Cap.   I shared the pizza with friends.  The sandwich was spectacular.

After consuming my carbs for the week (between beer, drinks, pizza, and cheese steak) I entered Jenny Craig's witness protection plan to hide from my trainer.

If you are in the area - check it out.   Get the Cheese Steak :)"}
{"text":"Love going to Carl's!! Brock and Russ are great bartenders and their signature drinks are all delicious!! Food is SO good especially the broccoli cheese poppers!! Gets a little packed on the weekends but hey, what good bar doesn't?"}
{"text":"This is a tale of two experiences.  First, I sat at the bar and the bartender (not sure of his name) had a mustache and black baseball hat on.  He seemed important like a manager or even higher up.  He was great.  He was on top of our drinks, talkative with us, and seemed very laid back.  There were TV's all over room and we were watching a few different things on a Saturday afternoon.  Then we moved onto the patio because our group size went from 3-5 and there was more room out there.  

This is the 2nd part of our experience.  Our waitress out there was awful.  I think her name was Autumn but she didn't seem to care about us at all.  There were several times where we asked for things like beers and she never brought them.  As we were sitting watching games, at one point we had 14 glasses on our table that she wouldn't remove when she came out.  Another group of 5 guys came out to join us at one point and while we were all talking, we realized that both groups were out of drinks and the other group actually went up to the bar to get drinks because she wasn't coming back out.  Finally, when she did, it took forever to get her back again.  Another strange thing was I asked her what they were known for since I had never been there.  She said the fish sandwich and the Carl burger.  I ordered the Carl Burger.  Nothing fancy there.  It was your average burger.  No more, no less.  The ironic thing is there were a few items that other customers told us about like the Cornelius (I think it was called that) and my buddies loved it.  They said it was awesome.  It kinda made me upset that I tood her recommendation rather than the customers.  Finally, I ordered a pretzel as well and the funny thing is the bartender came out at one point to bring me a pretzel I ordered and when he did, he took 8 glasses back with him at once.  We all joked that he did more in one trip than she did the whole time.

I would have rated this higher except for the poor service we got in the patio room.  If I go back, and I did really like the place, I would sit at the bar and stay there."}
{"text":"Walking in it feels like a local's place. Its a speak up or never be heard atmosphere. The staff was pleasant and accommodating. Now the food, it started with the lobster bisque soup which was warm, creamy, seasoned well (not over salted) its worth trying if your a fan of bisque. The sandwich I order was the 1/4 pound bacon cheese. its a your choice of cheese and toppings. the meat was fresh and there grilling was just like  it should be crisp and charred on the outside and pink in the middle, truly a well grilled burger. The bun was toasted with tomato and lettuce all fresh. The chicken ranch and bacon sandwich was equally well made with same bun and toppings."}
{"text":"Tried again this weekend and once again did not have any fried chicken. This is the third time that I have tried. The tell me kitchen forgot to bribe it another time was told it was out. Never again"}
{"text":"Kewl place to meet up with friends eat great bar food or just to stop by a do shotz so check this place out my yelpers"}
{"text":"I rather eat here then do anything else in the world!!!! It's so good, literally would pass up a BJ from your mom to eat here!!! Go.... Eat at Carl's.... Now"}
{"text":"I miss this place already. During the two day vacation in Pittsburgh, I quickly fell in love with Carl's. Carl's and the Library in Pittsburgh would be regular spots for me and my friends if I were a local. 

Just a mile or two from Monroeville's chain stores and malls [and less than a mile from 376], Carl's lives up to yelper Matt K's designation as a legend of Monroeville. Although modest with an old sign on the outside, Carl's is a great operation. Their beer selection is excellent, 19 beers on tap, 2-3 domestics [miller, coors], and the rest were micros, including summer selections from New Castle and Bell's, a couple Pittsburghs [Iron City], Victory, and even Hacker-Pschorr, my sister who went with me, said she hadn't seen that on tap in years, and I can't recall the last time I've seen it. Although they didn't have any happy hour specials, micros were reasonably priced at $4-5.

The service was fine both times I visited. The crowd was a bit older, baby boomers, during the happy hour and had some younger people as well at night. It's a step above a dive bar. In addition to the bar inside and the small dining area, there's a small outdoor concrete patio with a few tables. 

The menu of usual bar food [with an exception or two like lobster bisque] is extensive, very inexpensive, and self-described as homemade. I only shared the pork sandwich, for $5-6, was a great deal. The pork had a bit of fat still on it [alas], but I liked the barbecue sauce with a hint of tanginess and it came with french fries.

In a land of the generic suburbs, Carl's was a great paradise."}
{"text":"Carl's is a great local bar / restaurant.  You cannot beat their wings - they are the whole wing and they are big!  Hubby loves the fish sandwich, also big!  They have a larger than usual menu and everything we've tried is well prepared & served with a smile!

The expanded parking lot and outdoor deck are great additions - so if you're looking for a comfortable, casual atmosphere and some nice food choices get to Carl's!"}
{"text":"Carl's is one of our goto spots on a late night when we don't feel like cooking. I came here just to grab a soup and salad and ended up drinking some new beers.

I ordered a caesar salad with light dressing, sometimes they add too much if you don't tell tem before hand. It comes premixed so you don't have to toss the salad at your table. I got a small because i wasn't that hungry but the plate was way bigger than i thought it would be. Like bigger than what wendy's considers to be a full portion salad :). I gobbled it down while waiting for some chili. They don't have any soups other than chili which was a bummer and most of the foods is bar food. Fried appetizers. about 20 sandwiches and pizza and a few entree's. My hubby ordered the hot turkey with mash potatoes. he said he was eating light bu then orders gravy on everything lol! 

My chili arrived with his meal and we both dug in. I'm not a huge fan of chili but i was craving something warm and soup like. This chili was amazing. Some of the best I've had. It was a nice thick base too not all watery like some i've had in the past. I love the fact that the kidney beans didn't have that overpowering flavor but were rather subtle. There was plenty of meat and a few peppers to make it a wholesome meal. I added some onions and cheese and boy did this chili take off. I love how thick it is that i can actually take a bit of the meat and beans and savor the flavor! My hubby loved his hot turkey. it came with plenty of meat between two white bread slices and a good pile of mash! The gravy is pretty good too but not sure if it's homemade or not. The chili was homemade for sure. 

We tried some new brews while we were here. I grabbed a Yards Brawler and a stout who's name i can't remember. They went down really easily with our meals. They have some trivia cards on the table that we played with but most of the questions were out of our league. the place mat had some sports questions as well which was really fun. We ended up playing that after eating which gave our food time to settle as we drank. 

The dining area is kinda small, only 6 booths and one table that shares the back booth wall. THey do have a bar with more seating. On the other side of the kitchen. They have a patio that is open to sit at and when the weather is warm they open up the garage style door for fresh air. This is the first restaurant off the monroeville exit. It's on the right hand side at light, just across from shop n save. Try it, you'll like it!!"}
{"text":"I wandered over to Carl's when we were looking for late night food. Buffalo Wild Wings was the first choice, but there was a sporting event of some kind on, and that place was SLAM full for the rest of the night. 

Carl's seemed pretty busy, but it wasn't prohibitively so. The \"diner\" and \"bar\" sections are separated, so we were a little confused on where to go to find FOOD. We figured it out pretty quickly, but we stood in the doorway awkwardly waiting for someone to show up. The dining area was full of empty and dingy booths, but I didn't care how the place looked - as long as I could get a reasonable vegetarian meal. 

Our server popped out and seated us. I questioned her about the beers and prices, but she seemed like she didn't know or didn't care about it. Maybe she was just really tired at 12:30am after a long day, but I was frustrated that I couldn't get the information I needed. I eventually found out that the beers were pretty expensive - about $6 for a craft beer. Yuengling was on special for $2.25 though, so I lowered my standards and chugged one down....and then another. Meh, it works in dire situations. (Hey, I'm a tad bit of a beer snob)

My boyfriend ended up ordering a monster burger. I ordered fried mushrooms and smoked-gouda mac. His portions were outrageous and greasy - definitely looked like they were worth it. Mine were reasonable as well, and the mac was only $4. I was pretty impressed by how much I got and how little it cost. 

Overall, it was nice to chill here late at night. I would go back for sure, but I really wish they were more clear on beer pricing. Everyone was friendly and the food was tasty. It seems a bit underrated, but if you find yourself in Monroeville at 12am and wanting food - try this place."}
{"text":"We hit up Carl's today to pick our fantasy football draft order.  The food is good bar food, sandwiches,  hoagies, fries.  They have a decent drink menu.  The staff has been friendly and attentive each time I've been there.  They just remodeled the outside and the bar area.  Overall not a bad spot."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a casual, comfortable meal.  A local gem.  The burgers were fresh and tasted great.  The Italian Hoagy was very good.

A good value for the money.

Carl's had an impressive craft beer selection that was much better than expected."}
{"text":"They have a lot of variety on their menu. I got a burger and it was perfectly made with an amazing bun. The patio is a great place to grab a bite and watch a hockey game even if it's freezing outside."}
{"text":"I really like places like this and welcome the distraction from the usual foo foo places I seem to frequent regularly.  I took a couple folks who work for me this past week.  It's a super convenient location because it's literally a stones throw from my office, but I never think to go here.  They've made some recent improvements with garage style doors that open up to the outside new deck.  I can't say there is a lot to view since it's located off of a busy highway, but I guess it's nice to be able to sit outside on a sunny day.  The bar itself is the main attraction and takes up most of the tiny locations space.  Ray, Jessica and I decided to eat in the small dining room in the back.  It's a seat urself type of place and we were able to get a comfy booth in front of one of the small tv's blaring some soap opera (no cnn or espn for these diners).  Our waitress was friendly and greeted us quickly.  We started with an iced tea while we looked over the menu.  It's pretty standard (diners, drive ins, and dives type food) with a couple surprising additions like \"lobster bisque\".  I started with a cup of chilli.  It was served pipin' hot with cheese and onions.  It was reasonably priced and super flavorful.  I also tried the pastrami sandwich.  I was pretty surprised to the quality and flavor of the pastrami.  Something tells me they may cook this meat themselves instead of ordering it from some deli.  In either case it was great served on rye with dark mustard and hot crispy homemade fries.  Jessica had the gyro.  It looked okay, but it's probably not anything special.  Ray tried the lobster bisque.  He says he was a bit disappointed because it was just cream and butter with almost no lobster.  In my opinion, you should probably order chili type things here and stay away from the higher end items.  He tried the fish sandwich, which was cooked well and pretty large.  I've had there fish in the past and it's as good as any one from other local joints.  The service overall was quick and good and the food better than many similiar joints.  I think we'll stop here more often."}
{"text":"I've been going to Carl's for the past few years and it's a lot of fun. I don't usually eat here, but I need to do that more often. I forget how good the food is. A friend of mine had been hearing about Carl's for years but hadn't had the chance to go, so we went for dinner one night. We shared the cheese balls (delicious) and each had the BBQ cheeseburger. The BBQ sauce seemed to be missing, but Carl's burgers are amazing no matter what. The fries were a mix of regular and waffle (both were really good). And we shared a couple of desserts: the brownie sundae and the chocolate cake. All I can say is omg. 

Service was fast and friendly. Food prices are pretty low and the portions are rather large. Some reviews say that the beer prices are high, but they always seem to have specials. I'd say liquor is about average price (the vodka is, anyway).

There are regulars that come in for dinner/happy hour, and then a younger crowd later on. Things start to get crazy around 10 or 11pm. 

This place is a must if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"I have passed this tavern a gazillion times, as a youngster. My wife and I are in town visiting family. We decided to stop in and try Carl's Famous Fish sandwich, I got the platter instead. This place has been around since 1953. I believe this is the only location that is still open.

We had the Cod sandwich platter with fries and Cole slaw. The fish was seasoned, the bun was soft and the fries were good. Pub grub, but very filling.

The staff was very friendly and helpful with the questions we had. There are ample amount of flat screen TV's for watching the Steelers Pens and Pirates, when they are playing. In the summer months you can sit outside on the deck and drink and dine or dine and drink. The prices are average. Nothing that will break your wallet! 

There was a decent selection of beer on tap. Domestics and Imports. I didnt get a chance to see what the locally brewed selection consisted of."}
{"text":"I have been going to Carl's Tavern since I was a kid. Unlike the mullet, Carl's is a party in the front and business in the back. 

They have a great selection of beers on tap (about twenty), and the bartenders and servers are always friendly.

One of the surprises that you will find at Carl's is that they have the best lobster bisque for a great price. Their burgers are also tasty and cheap. Carl's is known for their HUGE fish sandwich, and even if you have a huge appetite be prepared to take some of it home in a box.

Carl's also recently added a deck for additional seating during the warm months. (They have outdoor heaters for the chilly spring and autumn nights as well). This is fantastic, as there isn't much dinner seating inside and outdoor seating is a bit of a rarity in Pittsburgh.

Carl's is closed on Sunday and it can get crowded fast, but those are my only complaints."}
