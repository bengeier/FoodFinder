{"text":"My father and I have been going to this restaurant since the hotel opened many moons ago.  99% of the time it is good food and good service.   They recently changed the name and some of the menu items.  I'm  all for change if it is for the better.  THIS IS NOT. Last night we went to grab a quick bite.  The poor server was so overwhelmed doing so much without any support.  Since we go there at least 3 times a month the staff knows us.  I have seen the lack of support for their team in the last couple months and how the service has gotten so bad.  We waited for over 10 minutes for drinks, 25 minutes for the food, and another 10 minutes to get cashed out.  I saw the server running all over trying to do his best.   The food-  I ordered the fajita chicken salad like I have many times in the past.  I was embarrassed for the company to actually put that salad on the table in front of ANY GUEST!!!  The chicken was diced up so tiny it looked like it was for a 2 year old.  Oh where was the rest of the salad.  Nothing but tiny diced up chicken and lots of lettuce. My dad, who has had the fajitas so many times couldn't even eat one.  The chicken had no flavor, overcooked, and there were no onions.  We asked for extra and got none.  Terrible. I have seen their business die down a lot since the new menu.  For sure now I know why."}
{"text":"The manager, ANDREW, is awesome! Very hospitable and genuinely cares about his guests! Staff seems happy to be there.Chicken Fajitas were great! Good, shareable size. Loved the bean/salsa bar. We were seated right away, towards the back you are somewhat shielded from the smoke in the casino."}
{"text":"This place is awesome love the food and my waiter Ever was so cool defiantly coming back!"}
{"text":"if u like hearty portions for cheap prices, than this is the place for u! the food is frigging hot, u can tell it was cooked to order. the unlimited salsa bar really puts it over. the service is really the only thing that could use a little help, but its a casino restaurant so i can imagine the creeps they run into:) Me and my man both ordered appetizers, entrees and desserts and paid a grand total of $27!!! it was a \"Uno Dos Tres Deal\" and we brought the half home we didn't eat! In this economy, this was a really great meal for an AWESOME price :-D"}
{"text":"This is an average Mexican restaurant. The salsa bar was very good and this would be the place to go if you planned on filling up on chips and different types of salsa. After the chips and salsa, we ordered the chile con queso which was very bad. It had virtually no flavor and we ultimately added in some of the salsas to give it decent flavor. For the entrees, we had an enchilada, a tamale, and fish tacos. They were pretty good but nothing special. We had a $10 off coupon and it still came out pricey for what we got. We haven't decided yet if we will go back or not."}
{"text":"WORST SERCICE EVER!!! Don't get me started on the managers that don't even care. I was seated at 6:42pm and we received our drinks and chips from the food runner (not our server) we finished the chips and drinks and waited and waited until 7:02pm when we finally got a refill on everything (still no server) finally got fed up and asked for our server. He finally came over at 7:05pm after asking our food runner that refilled our drinks. He took our order and left we kept waiting after that for our soup. 7:16pm still nothing and still no server and drinks and chips completely empty. We decided to leave and I asked for the manager. The guy manager think his name was Andrew came up and I told him everything. He asked where we were seating and I showed him and he just said ok. Over and over just saying ok. He obviously did not care about what was going on. I was over and just left to never come back to this place. I also deal with people and referring them where to go eat and they just lost all my business and my customers business as well. WORST PLACE EVER!!!!! MANAGEMENT INCLUDED!!!!!"}
{"text":"steak and shrimp burrito off the scale went back twice in same week so u know its  real . steak was cooked well both times second time shrimp tasted a lil overcooked but both times went down easy and was very satisfying to my stomach even though 20$ is a bit much for a burrito shrimp or not"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and have always had good service and good food in large portions. If you want to save a few bucks, get a frozen margarita at the bar for $1.99 and carry in. The casino mails out good coupons."}
{"text":"The salsa bar was a nice addition to dinner.  The bean dip (medium) is pretty mild, but you can mix it with a spicy salsa if you want.  Our waiter was polite but could have been a bit more attentive.  I had the three item combination plate.  Two shredded chicken enchiladas and a crispy ground beef taco.  The enchiladas were good, nothing exceptional, but good.  The ground hamburger tasted a bit over cooked and salty.  Personally. ....I think I'd rather have an encherito and burrito supreme at taco bell."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican Food Restaurant's.    Just don't sit at the rail and get the cigarette smoke from passerby's.  Fajitas rock.  Service is great and I love the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Old and reliable.  The name has changed from Guadalajara to Cabo, but the food remains consistent and good.  Miss the days where they had a gigantic salsa bar with a wide variety of salsa recipes (Palace Station).  Only 2 exist now with the salsa bar, Sunset Station and Boulder Station.  The bar is scaled down from the days of old, but it is still good.  Food is pretty awesome and the prices are fair and competitive.  Only downfall is that sometimes the service is pretty slow.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing service!!!! Thank you to our waiter Brent and the food and beverage manager for keeping everything in order. Came on a Friday mid September which was much better than expected at most other places. Our server was beyond helpful especially considering the amount of tables he waited! I definitely recommend this place to anyone coming from out of town, locals, and everyone in between. Perfect sit down with a nice atmosphere to match. Can't forget how great the food was, enchiladas and tamales were cooked to perfection. Don't forget the salsa bar!!!!! (-:"}
{"text":"So sad they closed the one at Sunset station. This one was nice, same exact menu, slow service.  But I won't be driving all the way here for dinner just because.  At least there are a few still around."}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos w/ corn tortillas are pretty good. The salsa bar is also decent...esp the beans!"}
{"text":"Pescado Del Mar is awesome. Orange Roughy topped with shrimp and seafood. The rice and beans were also very good and our family enjoyed the meal. The price wasn't too bad either I think we paid $70 for a family of 5"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over ten years, after this current experience it's my last visit. The service was the worst service I have ever had. After waiting through our whole meal and never getting a refill or half of our orders correct we called over a manager, explained the situation and his response was \"what would you like me to do about it\" no apology just offering us a free desert. Whoopee! Not that I was looking for anything free, but made me realize that a local joint would of appreciated our money over this corporately ran dump!"}
{"text":"just had dinner here, it was ok. nothing mind blowing. they have a salsa bar with bean dips that's pretty cool. I didn't take any pics but it was all pretty standard. parents got fijitas, they looked pretty good, sister got chicken tacos carbon, they looked plain to me, just a bunch chicken on a tortilla. I got the chimi taquito appetizer it was honestly kinda bland. I loaded them up with sour cream, gauc and salsa. is the food edible? yes, nothing gross or bad happened but if was all just kinda meh. I brought my husband home the steak tacos carbon he said the we're like del tacos which he likes so that's fine. the service kinda wasn't the best our server never checked up on us asking how it was going, we sat with empty drinks for quite a while waiting for him to come back so we could order, he was nice though. my dad is old and grouchy sometimes (he recently had surgery so tonight he was a wee bit grouchy) and he can come off a lil rough. i dunno if maybe he rubbed our server the wrong way, the server was always calm and patient though. all in all,it was OK. we will probably go again, but I'm definitely down to try other mexican food places. there's nothing special about cabo in Boulder station. it was very slow and quite. it was free cuz we used our points and just left a tip. so I can't complain. my dad goes to boulder everyday and racks up points on all of our cards, so I mean hell ya I'll eat there with my points. if I were paying all with my actual money I would choose another place though."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Friendly fast service.... had a Caronarita! Could drink like 20 of those!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I was expecting worse.  The food was good and the prices were decent.  I had a tostada with no ground beef.  It was gigantic and pretty tasty.  The black beans were spicy.  My BF had the veggie fajitas; it did not look good.  The veggies looked like they were from a bag out of the frozen section at the grocery store. Chips and salsa were good.  They have a salsa bar and all of the salsas that I tried were decent.  If I was in the area, I would go again.  It is far from the strip."}
{"text":"I was in there a couple of nights ago with some family..and the chicken fajitas were really tasty...we went in at about 9:30 at night..the night crew was friendly.. considering we were in there until after 10 almost lol"}
{"text":"I was there last week with a group of friends for a birthday.  The service was very, very slow.  We ordered a pitcher of margarita's.  It wasn't until after we ordered it we noticed that there was no price on the menu.  We figured how expensive can it be for a station casino restaurant.  The food was OK, nothing special.  When we got the bill we almost died, the price for a pitcher of mediocre margaritas was $40.00 we had ordered 2 pitcher's is and was OUTRAGEOUS.  The last pitcher that was brought out was all ice hardly any liquid in it.  We had to ask the waitress to add more liquid to the pitcher.  To top it all off we had half a pitcher left and who would leave it.  The waitress brought out clear to go cups to take it out.  You CAN'T take out alcohol and we told her this.  She then brought us cups that were not clear.  What a total rip off. When asked why there was no price on the menu she just looked blank (like a deer in the headlights).  I'll never go there again.  If I am to pay that much for a pitcher of margarita's I'll go somewhere a lot nice than this dump."}
{"text":"First time I tried this place it was real good, I had me some fajitas de carne asada. I love that they bring it to you pipeing hot with the steam coming out! That's how I love my food, but how did they know? Tthe meat and the bell peppers were dry and the tortillas were too, well, not really they just didn't have much flavor, but the salsa bar makes more than enough for it. Next time I tried it I figured out the first time it was great because I ate somewhere else. Cheap place to eat and it will get you full, it's not like it's real bad food. But both times I tried the margarita on the rocks were good. The service was satisfactory for a place out of the strip and being more local than anything. They were always there wondering about how you were doing. Now the salsa bar was awesome! I think the best thing out of this place is the salsa bar, If I would I would eat off of it haha.    Plus even if you have tasted better somwhere the whole slot machine in the casino kinda makes up for it because it's Las Vegas. The colors inside this place are good it goes with the environment in the casino."}
{"text":"Boulder Station's poor cousin to the restaurant bearing the same name (but virtually no other similarities) at Sunset Station.  Where Sunset's Guad features a relaxingly lit, thematically decorated restaurant area, this one is a glaringly bright, cramped quarters affair with a cafeteria feel about it. There's a self-help salsa bar that gets extremely messy and unsanitary looking, with significantly fewer options than the other location's extensive array.  The restaurant can get very noisy and kid-tastic also.   Food quality isn't up to par with what we are used to from the Guadalajara name either. I'll be sticking to the Sunset location."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our food and the service was excellent. They give you tortilla chips and then you go to the salsa bar and pick what salsas you like. I loved the mild salsa and medium bean dip. The server refilled our tortilla chips and water without us having to ask.  I had the crispy ground beef tacos which was very good. The tacos (3 of them) came with mexican rice and refried beans. I loved the rice! My husband had the rib eye steak and bacon wrapped shrimp and he said it was good. The steak was very tender (and he ordered medium well!) Anyway would have given 5 stars but my watermelon margarita was PURE watermelon juice and tasted like a sugar drink (my teeth hurt it was so sweet!)  It was supposed to have grand marnier and tequila. If there was any liquor in it it was miniscule. I should have returned it. Booooo to the bartender! What a disappointment. But would return for the food."}
{"text":"Literally some of the worst tamales I have ever had and the chile rellàno was not great. The cheese enchiladas were pretty good. We went there while waiting for the movie to start. It used to be a fairly decent place before they changed the name. The only thing that made the situation better was the waitress, Jackie. She was very professional and extremely sweet. She needs to move to a different restaurant so she can make a living, because most people wouldn't have tipped considering the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my husband. We received a coupon in the mail so we decided to try it out.  The salsa bar is a very nice touch. I would say their medium is actually more of a mild, though. The bean dip is delicious.  I ordered the two item combo plate. I got a shredded beef taco and a pork tamale. The tamale was too salty/hard for my taste. The taco was much more tolerable.  My husband ordered a two item combo plate with a shredded beef burrito and shredded beef enchilada. He preferred the burrito over the enchilada.  Both our plates came with rice and beans. Both the black and refried beans were decent. I'd give the beans a 7/10, and the rice a 6/10. As someone who grew up eating homemade Mexican food, my expectations are a bit high.  That being said, the service was quick and attentive, and the presentation was great. I would be willing to come back and try something else from the menu."}
{"text":"This place rocks as does the waiter Brenn!!  They have great table side guacamole and the chili con queso is amazing!!!  The carne asada platter and the fajitas are my favorite!  Be sure to ask for Brenn as he is one of the best waiters not only there but anywhere! If he's not there ask for Ever as he is great too! it's an awesome place to eat especially if you have a large group as it has a fun atmosphere and friendly staff, starting with the hostess I believe her name is Angela.   oh and don't forget to visit the salsa bar - yum!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I had ever had! We got there and it took them about 15 minutes to bring out chips and when the server got there she said oh my busser hasn't came? And than she left took another 10 minute to order drinks and another 10 minutes for the drink to get to us and when she finally came with the drinks she said \" oh do you guys want to eat?\" Uhhhhh duhhh!!! She even had a comment that said \"you guys look young\" just because we are young doesn't me we won't tip good! My boyfriend a server and he's all about tipping! We go treated the worst from the beginning and let's not forget they CHARGE for CHIPS! If you get a server name \"Jacqueline\" than just leave! We ate there around 3ishh"}
{"text":"Definitely not what it was like over the last 8 years.  I came here with a friend after the movies because it was on the way and I was craving their appetizers.    We didn't wait long at all on a Monday afternoon (this being the Boulder Station location).  We were seated in a booth by our hostess but it sank down lowww so we asked if we could change to a table top and they moved us.  The salsa bar was up-kept and my favorite were the medium green salsa and my friend liked the mango salsa.  The pico de gallo and bean dip they brought out with the chips were good too.  I love places that bring out chips or bread!  I came here mainly for their shrimp Guadalajara, jumbo shrimp stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon with a sweet honey sauce.  You get 4 jumbo shrimps as an appetizer.  It was well made and continues to be served flawless.    i didn't order an entree but I did have a cheap margarita on the rocks and a strawberry margarita blended.  They tasted how much they were worth for.  My friend had shrimp tacos and if I would have ordered I would have gotten a humangachunga.  Service was lacking a bit, I don't know if they were short staff because our server and busperson looked like they had the front and portions of the back.  For dessert we had the fried ice cream, that was always good.    Food was good//service was bad.  And mind you we came here during the day where it wasn't that busy like a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"I love the lunch specials here!  Especially the Fajitas!  Salsa bar has something for everyone.  Fresh tortilla chips...usually still hot when they get to your table."}
{"text":"Good but not great. I had chicken enchiladas, my grandma had the chile relleno and my cousin had the combination plate with beef enchiladas and the chile relleno. The food was good, service was good, the salsa bar was good. I think the chile relleno won as far as best dish!"}
{"text":"They don't have the ingredients to make a mojito. Second time we've been here since the name change from Cabo to Guadelajara. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"This is more of a 2.5 rating but I just can't give this place 3 stars.  Unlike the other Cabo I went to at Santa Fe, this Cabo at Boulder just seemed super off.  Kind of slow customer service from the start, long waits to get food. Yada Yada Yada.  The think that irked me a bit was that when I got the unlimited tacos, they told me I can only order 1 kind of taco and can't mix it up.  So I ended up grabbing 3 shredded beef tacos.    They were fairly on par.  Then I ordered 2 chicken tacos since I was trying to make myself vomit by the end of the night and instead of the shredded chicken I would get at the boulder station, it was just chicken chunks, no real flavor.  And mixing it with their flavorless rice didn't boost anything.  I'm not gonna knock on the chips, I love the chips and salsa but overall that won't make me give them a 3 star rating.  Conditions For Me To Return: - Someone pays for me or - Randomly drunk and felt like making sub-par decisions or - Really bored and have comp dollars and want to feel classy as opposed to eating Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Once again the Mexican restaurant in Stations casinos has changed hands. No longer Guadalajara, but Cabo now.  My fiance and I decided to stop in here late on Friday night after I got off work. I really wanted a margarita to celebrate the completion of my training.   We waited... A lot. We waited for the hostess to show up. We waited for chips. We waited for drinks... Lots of waiting.... I waited for a water I ordered that never came. So I drank my fiance's. We were never asked if we wanted a refill of our chip basket.  The poor girl serving us seemed frazzled. The busboy was of very little help.  The food was mediocre. My margarita was the star of the night. It was very good and blended well. They did honor the check-in policy and we got sopapillas, which we took to go.  I don't know why Stations Casinos keep changing their restaurants... But this change was not for the better. The only thing I'd come back for is another raspberry margarita."}
{"text":"Try the deep fried fish. It's served standing up on the plate with the head on. It looks like it's still swimming. I haven't seen fish served like this anywhere else. If you're looking for something different, this is it."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars it would be more fitting. Ordered fajitas. Usually you get a nice sizzling plate of fajitas. Nope not here looks like they just cooked the fajitas put them on the skillet let them cool completely then brought them out. Not a sizzle or a hint of heat coming off the fajitas.  The beens were dry the rice was over cooked. My son ordered a beef bean and rice. Not a hard order however he got a beef burrito the beans and rice were no where to be found.  We brought this to our waiters attention he apologized and took it back. About two minutes later. He returned with the same half eaten burrito which they had opened up shoved some rice and beans in and attempted to wrap back into its original shape. I honestly almost lost it. Who does this. I've been in costumer service for over 20 years and have never seen this.  Needless to say my son tried to pick it up and it feel apart. I told the waiter he needed a whole new burrito cause this was just ridiculous.  If they are willing to do this with the food can you imagine what short cuts they are willing to take in the casinos other restaurants and in the hotel rooms.  Being a local and having come here on several occasions I can promise you this will be my last."}
{"text":"Don't let the location of this restaurant fool you; it's a hidden gems among the in-the-know locals.  All you can eat salsa bar and amazing bean dips!  Their menus aren't extensive, but it has your usual suspects, which exceeds expectations.   I love their taquitos from the appetizer section.  It is enough for a full meal.  Margaritas are also awesome.  Must try if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"While claiming to \"love locals\" from every local television outlet, we were bemused by staff comments on service at Guadalajara, the Mexican bar & grill off the casino.  With a little less than an hour to show time, we considered a quick drink and snack at the bar, followed by a casual stroll to the show room.  20 minutes after sitting at a bar table, making repeated eye contact with the wait staff, we remained ignored.  Polite initiative resulted in chips & salsa, over-sweetened  lemonade and a margarita made from an off-the-shelf mix.  Table-side guacamole 'served with warm tortillas' was served with the same chips provided with the salsa.  We heard lame excuses about a power outage, being \"very busy\" and no through-put in the kitchen.  No back-up generators in a casino?  Really?  The surly waitress might have had a bad night, but that's no excuse for being rude.  The manager was apologetic and made compensatory overtures which were appreciated.  How difficult is it to get service right from the onset when a guest enters the dining or drinking area?  After all, it's Las Vegas!  But what about \"We Love Locals!\"?  Why is management so blind to the quality level of service in such a competitive environment?  Is the economy so dreadful that staff is hired without appropriate training in \"hope\" that \"things will work out\"?  While Guadalajara at Boulder Station stands as an example, it's not the only venue suffering from arrogant service staff, ill equipped from a lack of training or the business values imbued from a successful and attractive destination.  Re-directing investments from TV advertising to staff training and business execution will result in more demand from word of mouth and repeat customers happy with their experience."}
{"text":"I went there on 6/23/16 and ordered a shredded beef burrito. I chomped down hard on something metal, it was like a nail or something like that . I complained and they offered a new meal, but I was so disgusted that was in my food- I was not interested in eating anything else. Found out a little later that my tooth chipped- going tomorrow to dentist for that. How does a piece of metal get into food? I hope they investigated so it won't happen again to anyone else. I opted not to file a complaint because I only realized the chipped tooth later, was already stressed over another situation not related."}
{"text":"If they're open at 11, the bartender and a security officer are unaware. Just standing here looking stupid.   Went to viva salsa instead. Then home. Not gonna gamble here if they don't know when they are open."}
{"text":"Stopped in and had great food and our waiter was very attentive. Carne Asada platter was yummy and the chips were warm, so good with the bean dip and salsa!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Mexican dinner, it was OK nothing special, the salsa bar was pretty mediocre, everything almost tasted the same. The place needs updating the tile or chipped and dirty looking. Had better other locations typical of a casino restaurant, everything was like a fast food restaurant, and that's without being fast."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! I love the atmosphere. Staff is always friendly and smiling. Food is amazing. Drinks are awesome! Salsa bar is my favorite and the guacamole is to die for! I highly recommend this to anyone trying to find a cute little spot in East Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was seated right away. We received salsa and bean dip which was pretty tasty. I ended up getting full on that because it took awhile for my food to come. I ordered chicken enchiladas... they were ok. The chicken could have been seasoned a little more and also for the length of time it took for the food to come out, I would have thought it would have been piping hot but it was just warm.   I think this place is ok if you're staying at the hotel and want something to eat without leaving the building. I can't say I would go out of my way to come here and get Mexican food when I have a craving but it was ok."}
{"text":"Deep within the labyrinth of a casino, amongst the lewd smells of cigarettes and desperation lays a surprisingly tasty Mexican food restaurant! Yes, Cabo is so out of place amongst the fast food restaurants, the buffets and the other gaudy dining options in this casino, but it's still worth a look-see.    Went here on a Sunday, wasn't that packed compared to the obscene lines at the buffet in Boulder Station. The service was remarkably slow. A bartender after a good 5 mins of us waiting for a hostess decided to seat us out of pity. It took another 10 or so mins for the waitress to come over to give us menus and tell us about the salsa bar.  Now the salsa bar is a true pearl. I really enjoyed the black bean dip! My lawd it was tasty especially when you add in raw onions....!! The salsa bar contained different cheese, bean and other salsa dips all waiting for you to enjoy while your food is being prepared. Of course I would recommend the black bean dip as it was delightful on the buds and even more charming as it traveled down my gullet...  For my entrée I choose the Shrimp Tacos (grilled shrimp, avocado, cabbage, salsa blanca with corn tortillas) and it was paired with rice and black beans. The tacos were marvelous. Nice plump shrimp that was well seasoned, very flavorful. I event liked the cabbage over lettuce shreds as it really added to the texture of the entire dish. It was pretty darn tasty for its price point and for it to be our second choice dining option.  We were able to pay with our hotel credits so we didn't have to worry about the bill but for 3 entrees it was less than $50 so that's reasonable.   Besides the lackluster service, this place was pleasant! Would recommend esp if you are staying in the hotel."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the food. Got the combo platter with a chile rellano (good but tough), pork tamale (dry and super doughy, tasted like it has sat on the back of a semi for a month) and a shredded beef enchilada which was par at best. Refried beans had a weird film over them, possibly been sitting in the pot all day. Friend ordered the Shrimp Fajitas and had to return it. The shrimps were burnt beyond recognition and the whole skillet platter had about an inch of oil floating on the bottom. The best part of the meal was the free chips & salsa. Service from our waitress was poor but the soda & chip guy kept our beverages & chips full and they never went empty, saving this from a 1 star rating. Ya!!! for the low man on the totem pole, the chip & drink guy."}
{"text":"Took the family here last night, and wasn't expecting much.  I was pleasantly surprised, and so were my adult children.  Maybe it was because it was 1/1/13 and everyone else was still partying on the strip, but we were seated immediately and had a server (Antonio) at our table within a minute.  Food was a bit slow getting to us, but well worth the wait...and we enjoyed the chips and salsa with salsa bar while waiting.  Antonio was attentive, and I appreciated he filled our glasses often.  I'm a NON smoker, and would have liked to have been seated somewhere more away from the smell of cigarettes, but that's the only real complaint I can come up with.  Including tip, $60 dinner for 4 people is exactly what I'd expect.  My salad was fresh and HUGE, my son's steak fajitas were cooked just right and not overdone, my daughter's chicken chimi platter was also HUGE and flavorful, etc etc etc.  Everything looked fresh and tasted good too.  I'll be back, but will request to be seated in a more interior location away from the chance of dealing with cigarette or cigar smoke interfering with my meal.  The proximity of the Havana Lounge nearby may have had something to do with it too!?!"}
{"text":"Had made plans to meet with a friend to catch up. Thought this place would be good since it's close to where we live.   The cigarette smoke completely wraps around you here. The smell is so strong we only sat here to eat and left as soon as we could. It was very pungent that just ruins the food.   The waiter was very attentive and nice. The food was so so nothing amazing that I would go out of my way to get. I got a corona mixed with a margarita it was weak."}
{"text":"Cold tacos, funny tasting shrimp burrito and poor service explains why they told it is a mandatory 18% tip. Stay away!"}
{"text":"I think my experience and review of eating at the Cabo \"Mexican\" restaurant would of been different if I would of been slightly tipsy from drinking a  giant margarita...too bad I completely sober though!  The Cabo Mexican Restaurant needs to ante up (oh man, thinking about playing cards now ha)  their customer service.  My boyfriend and his family and friends and I waited more than 15 minutes to get our beverages. The Saturday night was no busy at all. The food took long too. Not sure why it was taking so long for simple quesadillas or to slap on some ground meat on a tortilla and call it a night.   I ordered the carne asada tacos with avocado slices instead of guacamole. When my plate came I was surprised to find two sad looking dry carne asada tacos and almost 1/8\" of a slice of avocado...should of just got the guacamole huh haha.  The one thing I really liked about eating at the Cabo \"Mexican\" Restaurant was that they had a salsa and chips bar. I shoulda just gone wild and filled up on that. NExt time, I'll drink up and chip/dip it up."}
{"text":"This place has poor service. Food is just ok. It took a long time for the waiter to get our drink order, a long time to get the drinks. It was a long time for everything. We were there a good 50 minutes before we got our food. And the restaurant wasn't even busy. Other tables were getting their food long before we got ours. This was our second visit. The first, back in April, was pretty much the same. I hope my family never chooses this place again. Del Taco would've been better. And faster."}
{"text":"Moses is trash worse server I've ever had he threw straws at us and was trying tovolay super hero to about 7 tables he clearly needs help and a better attitude don't order from Moses"}
{"text":"I thought the food was pretty good, better than I expected for a casino like this way off the strip.  I was simply a tourist, and live in L.A. (land of mexican food) and was pleasantly surprised. Their shredded chicken was real moist and flavorful.   Drinks were great, service was cool, salsa bar was nice...etc.  I can understand ppl not digging the atmosphere, but remember where you are at."}
{"text":"People are friendly here and the salsa bar is just awesome! The have complimentary chip for your salsa! Just make sure to not sit near the door because u will end up with cigarette smoke coming at you.  Service depends on who you get basically, today I had a waitress who was a bit slow and tends to get sidetrack but she's nice enough . The food portion was good enough :-) and adding the chips and salsa and u will be full for the rest of the day lmao. Beach party platter was good it has a sample of almost all their appetizers. Chimichanga was big enough and super filling so all and all a happy tummy and a very full customer"}
