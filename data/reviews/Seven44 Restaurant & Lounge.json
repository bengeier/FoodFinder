{"text":"I've seen a number of bands here. All pretty good. There's a Fleetwood Mac tribute coming on Feb 14th. Fleetwood Mix. Supposed to be the top Fleetwood tribute in Canada. Will definitely check this band out."}
{"text":"Wow, I had such a different experience than the previous reviewer? Sounds like he has an axe to grind? As for the other places he mentioned, two are not exactly what I would call clean?  I have lived in this area for 30 years and have experienced many changes. Seven44 is a great place to see live bands and is an institution in Toronto. My last few times there have been fabulous! The service was great and so was the food we had (wings & quesadillas)!  We had wine and pints and never felt sick the next day? But then again we ate real and good food, not something from a hot dog cart!  If you have a bad reaction to something you ingested, the Health Department should be contacted.  Otherwise, your negative comments can be considered slanderous and unfair without proper evidence.  I, for one will happily continue to enjoy Seven44!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because I live in the area (wanted a shady patio) 

NOT what I was expecting. The service was fine, the food was not good - like at all. 

I sat down and was greeted immediately which I appreciate, I just got a water for the time being. I took a look at menu that's pretty basic (wings, burgers etc) I wanted something quick so I asked for the clubhouse with a caesar salad instead of fries. To my surprise, ordering a salad instead is 2.99$ extra? So I agreed and waited for my meal. 
3 minutes!!! That's how long it took. However, I've never known anyone to mess up a club. It was dry, had a weird taste, was simply depressing how small it was. My salad was dry with barely any dressing, with everything just thrown on the top of it. Definitely not worth the extra money. Not impressed. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"this place charges a cover. it the only one in the neighborhood. it's over priced  and a dump.
i really have tried to give this place a chance. just can't do it.  It is known as the cougar bar. but i thought cougar went after younger guys. This place has a lot older guys!
and with such an older crowed they have a lot tribute bands that i don't  think the older folk can handle.
There been a couple of times i seen a band listed and thought oh ill check it out. So i paid the ten dollar cover and I, gotta tell you. it was a let down. I seriously  left each time.
Just around the corner, on eglinton ave. there are a couple of other bars that don't charge cover. Better live music and more decent.

with that thought. i have too say. this bar caters to 50+.
they have a large dance floor, patio and parking on the street."}
{"text":"Do not sign up for the online VIP list - promising free admission on anniversays and birthdays. After submitting my info/data - never received any confirmation- and they didn't honor a free anniversay. Only if we arrived. before 8 - no music or dancing until 10. Not a reputable place."}
{"text":"This was probably my fav guilty pleasure destination (20 years mabe...ouch) I still call it \"You know!? The Chicken Deli! Right around the corner from the Uni..corn! See you there! \" (I miss the Uni). Now I get to miss the Chicken too. If I ever really accepted the re-name to Seven44 I'd morn it too. But I didnt get invested in names. What's in a name? I can only hope that the next establishment \"owners\" do better to keep it going. But probably the fact that it changes management is what keeps it interesting. The south / west corner at Eglinton and Mt. Pleasant will alwzys be special to me. Long live the Deli. 3 stars because I am in a love hate relationship. With this place. I always feel at home...but I can't understand why. Why is that?"}
{"text":"I came here for New Year's eve 2015 with few friends. The place was packed. Its basically a bar with a dance floor. They do not have a signature brew so basically their alcohol selections is what you find at many bars. Waitresses were quick and friendly.

Dance floor was spacey and was flashing with assorted laser lights. Live DJ was a crowd pleaser. He was playing an assortments of songs, from slow dancing to upbeat EDM from different generations. Crowd was mainly 40+ though I did meet few younger people. Great, Energetic crowd overall.

Overall it was a great night. I will surely come back for more."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday, mostly to hear the weekly hot jazz group (Climax) that calls this place home.  Normally they get a good crowd but the snowstorm kept people away.

First the good: the service was excellent.  Cindy made me feel very welcomed.  There is good service (bringing food/drink in a timely manner, checking in, etc.) but then there is a whole other level which involves making guests feel special.  My martini was totally up to task and the ribs and chicken, mashed potatoes and corn all did the job.  Not the best in the city, not the worst.  $24 seems a fair price.  The two Kronenburgs were fine.  

Beyond the fantastic service, there was the band and the people that braved the snow to see them.  Everybody I talked to was very friendly and the gentlemen of the band were eager to talk about jazz.  There is a kind of a community here and I really wish I could duplicate it somewhere on the Danforth.  (lots of friendly pubs but no regular jazz gigs)

So why only three stars: at 4am the next morning it became very apparent that something was not sitting well and I can only assume it was dinner.  I cannot prove this but cannot think of anything else to have been the cause.  I'd assume the food poisoning came from the chicken.  

Final verdict: I like this place a lot and would go back, perhaps even trying another night.  (They host a big band event, reggae, etc.)  I likely would not go just to go--there are any number of watering holes much closer.  (I suspect this serves as the local for many people in the area).  As for food, it could have been a fluke but I'd probably try a sandwich or poutine next time around.  

Recommended--especially if you are looking for traditional jazz from 4 to 7 on a Saturday.  (And note that there are a lot of choices for this on Saturday in the city)."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, most recently a few days ago.  To be honest I go here to listen to my friend play in the band.  It's the typical pub place but slightly nicer.  There is the space for the band and a small dance floor and sometimes there are some swing dancers that get on the floor and get groovy...or swingy..and I have seen a few jazz hands rocking in the air

I have tried the food here on a few occasions.  So now I eat before I come here.   LOL,  Nothing I have tried here I liked very much, kinda blah.  The saving grace is at least the portions are large, but I wouldn't say for the price they charge you are getting a deal.  The service is ok, nothing outstanding, but nothing bad either.  

Apparently this place gets really busy on Mondays since the band plays regularly then, but don't expect to go there and try and pick up a date...unless you are over 70 - which in that case you will have your pickings!"}
{"text":"It's not the fanciest of venues and the way the bar was arranged on Super Bowl Sunday, they took care to ensure patrons could sit literally, in front of the tv - we all congregated around the large screen projector. That was a very attentive touch.

I was surprised the menu has many interesting items and since I had had no meal since breakfast, I opted for the jerk chicken dinner. The chicken was tender but not spicy. I would have preferred a more hot & spicy flavour. Given the side choices, the meal can be surprisingly healthy or a junk fest. You have a choice.

Unfortunately, I was not very pleased with the server. I gave her 2 $20s for a ~$23 bill and she only gave ~$7 in coins......I had to flag her immediately to bring to her attention that I had given her two twenties! She apologized immediately and gave me the correct change. But this situation hasn't happened to me before and I found it in in poor practice."}
{"text":"Horrible! I have never seen such unkept, dirty, lot of men in all of my life. I went for a \" salsa night\" hosted by meet up, and promptly left 20 minutes later. If you are going to go out for an evening, wash your hair and leave your dirty fishing clothes at home. And stop staring and leering at women, it's creepy. Age group was 40 and older... Waaaayyyyy older. The waitress was also very rude and had a bad attitude. Washrooms were gross - not at all shocked *shivers* cannot believe they charge a cover too, pitiful."}
{"text":"Formerly \"The Peoples Chicken\" has a new look and name, and thats about where it stops. Its the same place, same service and same atmoshphere, just a new sign, no chicken on the roof.  Went in for a pint with some friends and stayed for two more. The next day me and my two friends all had the WORST hangovers weve had in a long time, and gut rot!  Those taps were dirty you could taste and feel they dont clear the lines and made us all sick, never had 3 small pints ever made us all hungover let alone sick.  Sorry that alone is why i wont go back, im going to clean places like \"The Duke\" or \" Unicorn\" or \"Fox and Firkin\""}
