{"text":"Was my favorite Mexican restaurant over the years in Greensburg. Try the el combo if they still have it. A little bit of everything."}

{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in the area. The taste of food above and beyond anything you've tried in big chain restaurants. It really feels like home made. The size of plates are huge so there is always some food left for later. The drinks that owner makes is just outstanding! My favorite is Almond Peach Margarita with perfectly balanced all the ingredients. Is you what to enjoy your meal and treat your rate buds Cuzamil is a no brainer."}
{"text":"Don't even bother. Just light your money on fire, waste 2 hours of your own time, and eat canned beans.  The absolutely slowest service I've ever experienced on non-peak hours. It was almost as if she was annoyed to have customers. No drink refills. The food runs either bland with no seasoning or entirely too spicy in a way that makes your tongue bleed. 5 out of 10 on the \"spicy scale\" should not be inedible."}
