{"text":"I have checked out other pinata stores but by far this is my favorite spot. Great selection and variety of party goods, candy and pinatas. The only deception is that yelp is sending people on a wild goose chase since el rey de la pinata  is not located on bruce and bonanza. Its actually located on owens and eastern. Address is right but just use your maps app to locate it, thats what i did."}
{"text":"Five stars for the piñatas! They are the only place in town with Angry Birds and multiple characters from the game to boot.   The candy, gum, and toys to fill it is really low priced too, but watch the lollipops, most contain chilli and are spicy in the center.   They have a lot of character party supplies that are hard to come by elsewhere and they are masters of what they do. The prices can't be beat. $10 for a small one along the lines of what you'd find in Target, Walmart, and Party City for much more and their big ones are beautifully made and only $20 a pop They can do any character that they don't already have if you pre-order. This will definitely be our go-to place from now on."}
{"text":"DO NOT go here. Bought a piñata with plastic balls by the next day half the balls popped. Came back to the El Rey and told them piñata was defected did not want to replace or give me money back. The manager said All sales are final. I didn't see not one sign in the store that said that or on my receipt. Absolutely no air inside the store which is really hot and also didn't see any business license visible. Front door glass broken which is hazardous and is taped with thick scotch tape. Somebody call the Better business bural. Horrible horrible!!!!"}

{"text":"Bought a piñata for my son's birthday, good price, the mexican candy selection is pretty good and on a decent price. I would definitely recommend this store."}
{"text":"They have custom made piñatas, which is extremely hard to find in Las Vegas,  at a very reasonable price too. I thought the store was bigger, not all the premade piñatas where supper pretty, if we compare them to the custom made ones. They did however had a good variety of Mexican candy and plenty of characters to choose from. Good customer service."}
{"text":"Great Selection and Great Prices!!  They had everything and can custom make as well. Word to the wise bring cash or be prepared to pay an extra dollar to use plastic."}
{"text":"Really nice staff and great variety of piñatas. Fairly priced and had options of various sizes. For Disney fans, this is a great spot. Had some party decorations as well, so a good stop to make as you prep for a shindig. Appreciated the \"adult\" themed piñatas as well!"}
{"text":"Do not rent tables and chairs from here they will never show up. My son is leaving for the navy my order never showed up. I called the day before to confirm and on Saturday they told me they never gave my order to the driver  Very bad for business"}
{"text":"Anytime i have a party or gathering i rent from them. Great service AMAZING price. So friendly and easy going. Today i had to reschedule last minute, with no problem they just rescheduled date and transferred  my deposit to new date."}
{"text":"Best place to get a piñata by far and at a cheap price!Ask for a customized piñata and you'll get more than what you expected."}
{"text":"This is truly ART!!!  This store is soooooo underrated! I came in here after going to another store where they wanted $40 for a made to order piñata. It wasn't that long ago I was a child and know Piñatas cannot be so expensive. I pulled up yelp and put in party store and brought this store up. Decided to come pay a visit from all the way in Centennial.   They have every type of piñata you are looking for, I'm all sizes and occasions. And if they don't they will make it for you! We are having a \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" party and the ship piñata they made was so great but incredibly unexpectedly amazing. We ordered it along with a piñata stick.   I will ALWAYS get my Piñatas from here! They also have a great selection of Mexican candy!   Incredibly affordable, and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I got a custom piñata for $30! Such good quality. They have tons of Mexican candy and all kinds of party supplies! This place is a one stop shop for all your party needs! We will be back!"}
{"text":"you know whats even crazy about this company ! david which is the owner said that this review was funny ? really shame on you as a business owner... another update the fire department did go to this business and refer to their broken glass door held up with scotch duck tape... david advised her he would have it fixed by monday... my son is going to a doctor for the glass that got in his hand caused by the door being cracked.... so next step is my attorney contacting you for the damage your door caused my sons hand... please david click funny again...helps my case.."}
{"text":"Who doesn't want to pick up a stick and beat the crap out of something and then have candy come out of it????   So if you need a pinata for any function or Hell- just to relieve stress this is the place to go....  LARGE HELLO KITTY PINATA NEEDED....... LARGE HELLO KITTY PINATA FOUND!!!!!!!!  They have all kinds of pinatas for good prices. I paid $20.00 for a large hello kitty pinata- for a pinata at a regular store (Party City, Walmart ect...) all they do is put a flattend mylar balloon of the character on a small/medium ball type of pinata and then charge you $14.99 and higher. Sucky deal if you ask me..... JUST SAYIN!!!! But here you get a pinata that actually is designed to look like your character. If they don't have a certain character on the floor that your lookin for just order in advance and they'll make whatever you want and I think that's $5.00 more.  They even have wooden pinata sticks wrapped in different colored cellophane paper for only $1.99 each.  The store is a little dim and there are party supply stuff for sale however those seem to be priced higher than at Walmart or Target.  So I suggest that you buy your pinata here and the other stuff elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decent prices, and they had a good variety of piñatas and party favors. Pleased customer."}
{"text":"Custom piñatas whaaaaaaaat!!! I was looking for a special piñata for my football event. I couldn't believe this place existed in Vegas. I drove there to check it out and placed my order. For just $35 I got a huge piñata that was supposed to look like Jay cutler of the Chicago Bears. I picked it up a few weeks later and was quite impressed. It is hysterical.    I gave them some pictures so they knew what I was looking for. The helmet is a bit goofy looking and the colors aren't quite right but it's worth every penny. The Staff are so friendly and helpful. I bought some Mexican Candy and a piñata stick also. The guy cut a hole in it for me so I can put the candy and other goodies in later. Overall a great experience and I now know where to get a piñata made. Love!!!!!   The parking is very scarce. FYI"}
{"text":"I have purchased pinatas here a few times over the last couple years. Other than a not so convenient location they are good. They normally have the character I'm looking for on hand. This last time I went I had them custom make me what I wanted for only $5 more. Since I went in advance for the party I told them I'd come back in two weeks for it. I'm not sure how short notice they will do on custom orders. I told them I wanted a ninja in black clothing; pretty vague. When I went to pick it up it was cute and even looked like it was jump kicking in air with weapons attached. I'll post a picture soon. In all it was better then I anticipated and will continue to return. Other times I've called I've had to use my bad Spanish but recently the employees speak and understand English well."}
{"text":"I have been here several times to get piñatas and candy for different occasions. Today I went in to find that my piñata was not ready, like they said it would be and was en route.  I could have easily been upset but the young gentleman (David, I believe ) was kind, apologetic and understood my frustration.  He actually offered to hand deliver my piñata to my home and he did. It's employees like him , who go above and beyond that keep customers coming back. And I will!"}
{"text":"I always have el rey do my pinata. They are priced good and I like their decoration. I request that they make the pinata sturdy. We get about 30 kids to hit it and the pinata last."}
{"text":"Ordered a piñata ahead of time was told it was going to be ready a day before. Showed up and it was not ready they said come back in the morning at 10am showed up and still didn't have it said to go back at 1pm and still not ready she did offer to deliver it at the end got delivered until 4pm. Piñata was nice but the wait was frustrating don't keep up with there word."}
{"text":"Great place! Worth the drive. Bought 2 piñatas ( minion and angry bird) for 46 dollars and 1 bags of Mexican candy."}
