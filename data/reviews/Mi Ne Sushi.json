{"text":"Sushi resto in Aurora? I had low expectations and discounted the rave reviews as being provided by folks who never had good sushi.   All I can say is... I was wrong. This place has great food, great service and at reasonable prices.   I ordered the sushi and udon combo, and its great value for great food.  Without doubt, this is the best sushi resto in Aurora, and its probably the best in all of the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in town...portions are huge it's always fresh and tastes amazing it's priced accordingly so...try the chefs specials ..the atmosphere is pleasant and it's always clean.  I have people come from scarbrough to this place because they loved the food that much."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about this place, so me and my husband decided to go last night. And the food and ambiance were def. NOT the best. The only thing that was good about it was the service.   The alcohol had been watered down! (and we only had 1/2 L of red wine)....it was obvious they had watered it down, it tasted like juice and it was a light red color.   The food was not the best, and fresh at all!   and the miso soup smelled like sausages!....i dont even want to know why or how!... seriously!   nevertheless, i would never go there again!! ever!"}
{"text":"We had gone to Mi Ne Sushi for the first time yesterday...the wait for the table was long but was totally worth the wait.  From the food, tables and to the wait staff everything was perfect.  The wait staff was nice and quick.    We had ordered the Love Boat, a mix sushi boat for 2.  The food was fresh and good portion and we even had left overs.  I love the room divide, it felt like we here the only people in the restaurant.  We had both our kids with us and did not feel like we bother anyone and s   Make sure you make reservation if you you plan to go."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean decorations, especially the semi private cubicles. Foods are really good, liked the sushi and sashimi very much, e.g. CL-10."}
{"text":"Salad was not my 'thing', but miso was really good. We shared four rolls - all very good. Price reasonable. Recommended!"}
{"text":"The quality of rolls and food is amazing.  Food tastes fresh, especially sushimi.  Their soups are good too, mushroom soup or your standard miso soup.  I eat here atleast twice a week for lunch or dinner.  The markham location is good as well.  If you are a sushi lover, i would highly recomend this place"}
{"text":"Amazing every time.  *love!*  Portion sizes are huge! Fresh was and flavour are amazing and the service is great! They are very friendly and the atmosphere is perfect for an intimate date or time with a great friend. :)"}
{"text":"I love their lunch specials! Great value for the quality and the amount of food.   We ordered a sushi combo with assorted nigiri sushi golden dragon roll, and a sashimi lunch bento - both come with miso soup and salad. Sashimi was fresh and the roll was huge! I really like how their rolls are packed with ingredients and not rice. Each bite is a mouthful!   Service was quick and friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have always liked MiNe (at Yonge & Elgin Mills) so I was delighted when the Aurora location opened near my office.  The menu selection and quality is just as great as the other location and because it's a new space, the table and booth arrangements have been better thought out.    It has quickly become a favorite lunch spot for myself and my co-workers.  I highly recommend MiNe"}
{"text":"This lunch was started off right by entering the restaurant with a greeting that would make Obama envious... Opening the menu to find tempura lobster (If you order this like we did...veteran move!)  Salads are big enough for sharing! (stay away from the Kani salad, too much mayo!) The rolls were carried over with two hands and are massive! we selected the apple orchard roll (a roll with apple in it) and some others, all great.  Finished with some orange and ice cream which will bring you good fortune in the year of the dragon!  Go to this restaurant! Boom!"}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place by far. Aurora location portion sizes much bigger than their downtown location. Orangeville roll is absolutely to die for. So delicious. Waitresses and chefs are super friendly. Takeout options are possible. You only need one of the special rolls to fill up - portions are huge and well worth the price. Lunch specials are awesome too- come with a bowl of miso and green salad. Salmon is fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"The waiters were excellent.  Prices are decent, little high, but the food is good at least."}
{"text":"The sushi were just ok.  Nothing special for a $16 roll. They are just huge and messy.  There is way better sushi in aurora on industrial  And very expensive.  B"}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese restaurants i have been to.   The staff and really nice and friendly, and make you feel really warm and welcome to the restaurant. Not to mention, the atmosphere is really nice.   The servings are really large and the service is fast. My go to dish is the Katsu chicken, which comes with a soup, salad, a bowl of rice, and 2 large chicken breasts.I usually can't finish it because its so big. I personally don't eat sushi, but the people i have gone with say its amazing. They have a pretty wide variety of dishes.   Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent tempura, great sushi selection. Friendly staff. Efficient take away service."}
{"text":"A little more pricey than a typical sushi place but it is WELL worth it. Rolls are larger than average with minimal rice and maximum filling. Atmosphere is quaint and unique. Great experience overall and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for a while. The quality of their sushi is definitely the best in Aurora. The service however has gotten worse and worse. The past couple times we have had to wait 15-20 mins just for someone to come by to take our order. Then wait another 30-40 mins for your food to arrive! Feels like they prioritize take out so you are left waiting for a long time for your food.  Likely won't come back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I prefer this place over Tomo. The size and quality of the maki rolls is great. A little on the pricier side and sometimes the rolls are inconsistent but overall great place."}
{"text":"Great quality food, nice and clean interiors, great lunch menu as well as dinner! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place redines sushi.  We ordered way too much for 4 people.    Mango salad Kalbi dinner maki set H and I spicy smoked salmon roll     Each sushi is very large and double or triple the size of any other sushi place. So we all got quite full. one spicy salmon has like 3 pcs of salmon inside.   Great quality sushi in Aurora. High recommend.  price is reasonable given the portions."}
{"text":"Operated by Korean.  Not traditional Japanese cuisine.  But great sushi roll selections with big portions.  Great for take out for home party."}
{"text":"This place serves high quality Japanese food.  Quaint space that offers wonderful creative dishes. Their sushi is top end and their vegetarian rolls are outstanding too. A pleasant surprise to find such high level Japanese restaurant in the suburbs."}
{"text":"In my opinion this place has the best sushi and service in York Region.  I have tried many place but nothing compares.  My favourite is the Shrimp Dragon Roll and the hot pot Mushroom Soup...it is so good!  If you try once you will defiantly return for more."}
{"text":"The food is super fresh, the portions are excellent and service is great. Their quality of food never drops and is incredibly delicious! I get their boats and each time the sashimi is nicely cut, & their makis have excellent rice to filling ratio!"}
{"text":"I was by yesterday evening 8/7/16 for dinner.  Food was excellent however I found the service terrible; food came out delayed and at different times.  One of our mains was also incorrect so they needed redo causing a further delay."}
{"text":"Just passed by and decided to give it a try. I never had their cooked food yet. But they have amazing sashimi and rolls! The quality and portion was perfect for me. I would keep going back again if they keep up with their quality and portion."}
{"text":"Great quantity of food, attractive arrangement of sushi and sashimi.  A little pricey but do you really want to eat cheaply made sushi and sashimi.  Excellent service and patient with kids."}
{"text":"Got their lunch special.  It was OK.  taste was good.  Value also good.  Recomended"}
{"text":"We come here from time to time to have a roll. This is not my ultimate favourite, but they have consistent quality and a cosy environment. I love private booths and their fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I have been here at mini sushi a dozen of times. They have great food, great service and fair price. The lunch specials are great deal."}
{"text":"This is one of the few restaurants we go to that we know will always be fabulous. So, it was again great! Very friendly servers, very attentive and caring, very, very fresh sushi and a great lunch. I always ask for teriyaki sauce to be on the side and it is never a problem for them.   The owners of this restaurant have got it right - they hire good staff and insist upon fresh ingredients for a meal prepared in a timely manner. If you want a great Japanese meal, go!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sushi place period. The staff are amazingly friendly and the food is always fresh, the sushi pieces are huge!! There's also a little electronic bell included in each of the rooms, to have a waiter come over immediately, which is genius especially if you're in the private booths."}
{"text":"Great food but not customer service(waitresses)! Have to wait for everything 30 min+! Waitress is rude and with attitude  :("}
{"text":"This is a bit of a limited review as my first visit here was for take out. I got a couple of the Take Sushi for the family and it certainly hit the spot. It came with miso soup and salad. The Miso soup was quite good but the salad was at best forgettable. But we are really here for the sushi. It is as fresh as it gets. The presentation in a take out box was stellar. The selection in the assortment was excellent and it was all very tasty. The wait staff and the chefs were a very gregarious bunch with a friendly greeting even for the take out customers. The pricing is good value in that it is not inexpensive but you definitely get what you pay for. I will definitely be going back to try the in house service and will update..."}
{"text":"Been coming here since it opened.  Used to live in Tokyo, this is as good as anything I'd get in japan.  My husband is vegetarian and the options here are plenty for veg.  The food is superior and the presentation is outstanding.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch last week and was not disappointed. The lunch specials did seem to cost more than other places but it was well worth the value. Service was prompt; we were seated quickly and food came out quickly as well. I would definitely return if only it wasn't so far from where I live; I just happened to be in the area that day."}
{"text":"Great tasting sushi. Consistent flavour. MAKE RESERVATIONS if more than one person. This is a must try restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious food! The portions are quite sizeable. It's a quiet restaurant in a calm plaza - always easy to find parking."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for years. I used to say that this was THE only place in aurora/Newmarket area until last week.   The service is TERRIBLE. Rude and very slow. The sushi is not fresh and very expensive for what you get. I'll never go back and I would avoid it. Save your money and go to literally any other sushi place in the area. There's tons to Pick from."}
{"text":"Gigantic and thick pieces of sashimi and good value.   Got the large combination platter for 5 and ate comfortably.   Takes reservations and service was good. They even offered free miso soup for us as well."}
{"text":"Very fresh and great quality. We shared a Love Boat for 2 and a Lobster Roll. Very pleased as always. Amazing spicy salmon rolls."}
{"text":"Love this place. The price is a bit higher than Honba but portion is bigger. Quality of food is great."}
{"text":"It's probably one of the best sushi places I've been to. Everything is really fresh and the rolls are perfectly balanced. They are large, and a worth every penny! Came here for lunch, and the service was great.   Note: Sushi cannot be rushed, so don't come here hoping super-fast service.   Our server made a mistake on our order, and he was very quick to fix it. No complaints! One roll is generally enough for one person. Lunch for 3, 3 rolls - about $60 with tip.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The Aurora spot is my favourite Sushi place in York Region.  Always fresh and delicious.  Rolls might be too big if that's even a problem.  Noodle or Mushroom soup are always awesome. Never had a bad meal here. The service is sporadic since they opened the new place in Markham. Otherwise I'd give it a 5."}
{"text":"Very pricey, not a lot of booths so when people come in and the people say it's 30-40 min wait people get mad. The food okay but last night it made me really sick. I also asked for avacado instead of spicy salmon. She said okay but brought our spicy salmon. I knew they were busy and I work in food service so I didn't want to say anything but something made me super sick from it. Right as I ate went to bathroom!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in GTA. The special rolls are so fresh and tasty. I love their homemade dressing for the green salad and their miso soup is the best of any restaurant. The only criticism I have is that their special rolls are too big! It would be great if you could order half rolls. Try the polar bear roll - delicious!"}
{"text":"Mi Ne is probably the best sushi place in Aurora. I've found that most sushi restaurants in the area are mediocre at best, but Mi Ne is my family's new go-to sushi restaurant.  We arrived on a Friday night around 6:45 without a reservation, so we had to wait approx. 20 mins to be seated.   We ordered the Mi Ne Special Dinner, the Salmon Bibimbap, and the Sushi & Sashimi combination dinner. The sashimi was very fresh and the portions were generous. My personal favourites were the spicy salmon roll and the lobster tempura. The bibimbap, however, was nothing special."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi spot in Aurora! I've been here a few times and it's been great every time. They greet you right at the door to make you feel like home. Service is excellent, they always have people checking up on you. There's also a call service button as well for convenience. Sushi was fast and also tastes great! Definitely a great place for lunch as well since they have amazing lunch deals! :)"}
{"text":"I live in Toronto, but my parents reside in Aurora so I come every so often for a visit and when I do come I always find myself at Mi Ne Sushi.   The food is so fresh, delicious and great portion sizes. I always have the spicy maki roll and my family usually orders a sushi boat. The rolls are huge but does not have an excess amount of rice and the sashimi is always fresh. I have been here around 10 times and there has never been a time where the fish isn't fresh.   The service is always good and all the waiters serve with a smile on their face. Also, the restaurant itself is very clean. Definitely one of my favourite place for sushi not only in Aurora, but in Ontario."}
{"text":"On my 3rd visit now I had quite a poor experience. They have raised their prices a good bit as of April 30 2018 \"to preserve quality\" but quality had gone way down. Several pieces of sushi were barely edible, tough and dry, when they used to be buttery and moist. Unfortunate, I liked my last two visits here and now I won't be back."}
{"text":"It was an incredible lunch. We ordered the bento box with spicy salmon and tuna rolls, and it came with yam and shrimp tempura and spicy chicken, glass noodle, seaweed, and radishes.   It was so yummy. No wonder people like it here. The dress code for the staff was so cool: they were wearing kimono dresses, I mean not authentic but good enough for the appeal of the restaurant.   There are booths but it was just two people party so we ate at one of the tables in the middle.   One thing I don't like was that there were high school boys who were rowdy and disrespectful to own the other customers. The lunch prices must be good that these boys were there any they were bothering the people next booth.   Back to the food: even ordering simple salmon roll, what we got was these wonderful looking and tasting rolls EVER! I love it. It was so good that I had to order just one unagi roll and hmm hmm hmm."}
{"text":"I tried to go here for takeout.  They don't seem to care much, after waiting for a while and being ignored I was finally given a menu.  Few minutes later when I was ready to order I was informed that it would take an hour.  Not impressed"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I really like this place. It's small & gets busy quickly at lunch time. They do have takeout as an option.  When you first enter, you are greeted with \"hello\" from all the sushi makers. This friendly \"hello\" in unison is quite inviting & let's you feel happy. Now the servers are dressed in traditional looking Japanese kimonos which adds to the appeal of this place. They have some limited booths which is really nice & the rest are tables. On non busy hours the servers which are only women(I guess keeping it traditional) can handle the flow but once it gets busy it can be a tad frustrating to get a refill on drinks or more food. That being said the service is very friendly & fairly quick to place your order & receive it.  The food is very delicious, for Aurora this is definitely my number one spot for sushi & other things like tempura & teriyaki. They have a really good price point at lunch. I ordered tempura & sushi combo bento box which comes with a bowl of miso soup for $13 - a deal I'd say. The quality, price & atmosphere brings me back regularly. You also get a piece of pineapple at the end of your meal.   Domo origato for now."}
{"text":"You know what? I consider myself a sushi snob. I like the fish fresh and the preparation authentic. You are eating raw fish so maybe you might not want to go to a restaurant that offers all you can eat sushi, hint hint... Anyways my Lebanese Friend introduced to me this restaurant. I thought to myself and then vocalized it to his face, how can you show me a Japanese restaurant, I am Asian; what does a Lebanese know about sushi? Boy was I wrong. This restaurant is great. Yes it is a strip mall in Aurora, but the Korean Sushi chefs know what they are doing. The price is relatively higher then the average strip mall sushi but trust me  paying a little more for raw fish is a good idea for your bowels. Anyways sushi was authentically prepared with a long tail on the 3 pieces of hamachi nigiri sushi starter. My main lunch was a creative sushi bento box with a variety of items, all delicious. Please see pictures.   Bottom line, trust your Lebanese friends and eat at this sushi restaurant when you are in the mood and then think of me and your bowels. You are welcome."}
{"text":"It was our first time at MI-NE, so we decided to order \"Course B\" to try a little bit of everything. It came with 2 seaweed salads, 1 mushroom soup (more than enough to share), 1 choice of tempura (we chose 6 fried oysters), 9 pieces of the Orangeville Roll, 12 pieces of assorted sashimi, a choice of teriyaki (we chose chicken) and a choice of dessert (we chose cheesecake). It was 61 dollars for two people, which was worth it considering the quantity and quality.   Overall, the food was delicious! The sushi was fresh and high quality and the rest of the food was very flavorful. Way better than your run of the mill AYCE sushi place! The portion sizes were also generous and it was definitely more than enough food for just the two of us!   The service was really effecient and attentive and the atmosphere was cute and very private. If you're coming in on a weekend, call for a reservation to save a booth!   I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"Service is great and the booths are cute. The rolls are quite big. Unfortunately this restaurant doesn't have bento boxes. I was pretty disappointed. I would visit again though. The udon soup is very good. Great portions."}
{"text":"Probably the best Japanese dishes served north of Toronto. Handcrafted maki and Nigiri and original or classic sushi rolls. Never a bad meal served ."}
{"text":"Great sushi and Japanese restaurant.  The food is fresh, tasty and tremendous value.  We had the seafood Udon and the sushi boat.  The seafood Udon was packed with seafood.  It was just a couple of shrimp and mussels.  It had shrimp, mussels, large scallops and an entire lobster tail!  The sushi was fresh and really masterfully prepared and plated on our boat.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best Mine location in all their 4 locations. I'm so happy it's right near my place in Aurora. Mine sushi always deliver consistent good food. This restaurant was particularly clean and cozy with their little mini cubicles. Prices are great when it comes to their sashimi and rolls sizes. I love their lunch specials bento boxes. A bento box can feed two people and the choices of food in it are all very appetizing. We got a dragon roll with salmon and avocado, seaweed salad, crab meat salad, variety of tempura, chicken teriyaki. Salmon sashimi, some potato salad and some sushi. All this in the $20 range. Staff are friendly and they serve complimentary green tea."}
{"text":"This will be the only place I hit up for eat in sushi, such attentive service and if you pick the right special, it can be a crazy amount of food for a very fair price. I would reccomend this to anyone who wanted to go out for a nice experience at a sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi! Service is quite friendly, food arrives promptly and is beautifully presented. I highly recommend the miso soup, green dragon, and snowman roll. Warning: the sushi is HUGE! So you don't look so attractive eating it lol. But gosh is it ever good! Also call in to reserve a private booth!"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, just good! On the pricier side, but you get what you pay for, it's worth it.   Add: got platter take-out recently, and was pleasantly surprised at variety of sushi and maki. High quality and fresh, as always :)"}
{"text":"LOVEEEEE THIS PLACE!!! HAS THE BEST SUSHI!   I have been coming here for years and it never fails.   The roll size is very generous and the Kalbi dinner is my favourite.   Staff is wonderful! and the food is delicious!   Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Very clean and good service.  The good is excellent.  A little pricy but the value was solid overall."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. Lots of privacy for you while eating, you can even book more private booths which is nice. The cost is a bit more expensive than normal sushi places, but the quality and service really compensate for that.  The rolls didn't have too much rice, it was the perfect amount, fresh. I tried the miso soup and mushroom soup, both were clearly homemade and we're probably the best soups I've ever had at a sushi restaurant.  The staff are very friendly and helpful if you have any questions about the menu.  And to be honest I didn't even miss the fact this place isn't all you can eat. I find the quality goes down with all you can eat, but sometimes find I leave hungry at normal sushi restaurants, but I left super full and with left overs.   I would make a reservation, when we were there on Friday night we had to wait 15 mins for a table for 3 people.  A lot of people were walking in and out shocked they were being asked for a reservation for a sushi restaurant, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place... really, but there were a few things off with this place.  I got a set lunch (that comes with soup and salad) of 6pcs spicy salmon roll and 6pcs spicy tuna roll. , but these sushis were EXTREMELY spicy. It wasn't a subtle spiciness. Its spiciness built up to the point where you can't taste the tuna or salmon, it was just fire in my mouth. I thought to myself: ... maaaaybeee I should have seen this coming with the spicy label on the menu, but these are staple sushis I usually order and I'm always a big fan of spice. On top of the spice, single sushi serving was REALLY large. I've never seen sushi that big before. You're suppose to eat each piece of sushi in one bite/gulp and it wasn't easy/comfortable to eat these portions in one gulp. It took quite some effort to chew these things down. Everyone else at the table who has sushi agreed the sushi pieces were ridiculously big."}
{"text":"There isn't too much in Aurora that I can can quickly go to on lunch break and get something that I actually like.  Well I'm glad I found this place because it is a gem!  Located in a strip plaza this place does takeouts as well - which is what I got, which is a shame b/c when I went in to order I saw I was missing out on dining in here!   You are greeted pleasantly at the door (slide the wooden door - so cute!).  You are seated at individual tables (booths) with those curtains so it feels like a private experience.     I order the maki roll - 6 pieces of spicy tuna and 6 pieces of spicy salmon.  WhenI got back to work and opened the take out box I was shocked.  They were the largest pieces of sushi I have ever seen/eaten before!  And I have a big mouth ;)   So fresh and delicious tasting - I was sad that it took me this long to try this place!  Ok yes it is not cheap b/c my meal cost me $14 but it was worth every single yummy bite.    I would love to come back and dine in.  Just writing this review makes me want to go there again next week when I'm back to work..........!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in two weeks and the food is still great fresh and clean will be back"}
{"text":"Good food, good value and a nice atmosphere. What more could you ask for? The sushi here is scrumptious and the tempura vegetables are delish."}
{"text":"First time at Mi Ne Sushi. Really enjoyed the spicy miso soup, seaweed salad, sushi, etc.   Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is a cut above the other locations, especially in comparison to our horrid experience at the Markham location.  Our party of 4 ordered 2 dinner specials and the California Wagyu roll. We were only suppose to get two soups and salads but the waitress graciously gave us one set for each at no extra charge. The sashimi and chirachi was fresh and the rice was a bit on the hard side but acceptable. The spicy beef bulgogi has some bite and I enjoyed it. The udon was ok but on the soft side also. Similar to other locations, many dishes use the same teriyaki sauce and seasoning so they taste very similar.  However, the service made up for it. Several servers came by to check up on us and refilled our tea as soon as we hit the button next to our table. We also enjoyed the quiet that came with the small booth we were in. We definitely look forward to coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Udon hot pot is sizzling and delicious, fresh and high quality sashimi, amazingly clean and courteous staff...the best sushi place in Aurora."}
{"text":"Consistently fabulous and fresh sushi. Love the abundance of tobiko in the California rolls and the delicious sashimi."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Hard to get seats without reservations. So we end up doing takeout almost every time. Just as good eat it at home with some cold Sapporo."}
{"text":"Tried Mi Ne after the great reviews and I see why. The sushi was fresh and the tempura has lobster whaaaaat! The dishes were creati e and flavorful. Service was impeccable and prices very reasonable for the ex ellent quality"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best sushi places I've ever been to in the GTA. It's pricey, but the portion sizes are massive as a trade off, and the service is very good!  Bottom line: worth it!"}
{"text":"MiNe is beautiful. It is furnished with delicate paper screen doors embedded with dried flowers, and decorated with solid bottles of sake. The staff are lovely, and the atmosphere is warm; however, the first time I came here, I was thoroughly unimpressed by the food.   I ordered my usual: a beef teriyaki bento box. To my disappointment, it came in heavy beds of lettuce drenched in soy sauce, and showcases meager portions of meat.    I felt disheartened.   However, I gave this place a second shot- ordering a sushi roll this time- and this was SUCH a good choice.   If you order the sushi rolls, you'll get WAY MORE than you bargain for. The ingredients are fresh, and the portions are (SO) generous. Overall, this was a phenomenal experience in comparison to my first venture with the bento box. If you come here, I especially recommend the Rainbow Roll.   Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for lunch and much to my surprise it was AWESOME...!!  $10 got me a dozen pieces, miso soup, and a salad.  Fantastic value for money and huge portions.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The newest edition to the Mi Ne family does not disappoint! In fact it exceeded all my expectations. First, the decor.  Minimalist, elegant, yet casual, and very very clean. The service is just the click of a button away as each table is equipped with a button to summon your server. The special maki rolls are amazing!  Massive rolls, with generous portions of the ingredients.  Everything is fresh and has perfect texture! The yaki udon is hot and delicious, and the beef terriyaki comes with practically 1/2 a cow's worth of quality beef. This is my new spot! Order the kamikaze roll!"}
{"text":"Very good Japanese food. Love their udon noodles soup as well, but its on the pricey side. So far, this would be on the top of my list for Japanese Restaurants here in Aurora."}
{"text":"Very inviting when you enter the doors! Cute little cubbies where you eat covered by a curtain!    ***you receive a 10% discount if you pay by cash!   Very good food!  I had the green dragon rolls which have avocado and the sashimi salmon rolls. Absolutely delicious!!    A bit of a wait when you order the food but mine was for take out - next time I will call ahead and sit there for the whole ambiance!    Also very detailed menu with a zillion choices!    The woman taking my order the second time I visited spoke perfect English which helped immensely since I am still new to sushi.   Very very impressive menu!  And they have an email address as I wrote asking if they could make sushi without the rice as I love the dragon rolls, avocado, eel ... Etc but am trying desperately to stay away from rice. The gentleman wrote me back within a few hours stating they can certainly do this for me on any roll I choose."}
{"text":"This restaurant will always be my favorite. When I feel like treating myself I always come to Mi Ne! It's so much better than all you can eat places. Truly does not compare. We got the happy boat!!"}
{"text":"Horrible food and service. Not sure why anyone in their right mind would go here, especially when Tomo is right around the corner and priced fairly the same. After being seated in the half empty restaurant for 10 minutes, we had to flag down a waiter to get some tea. Our miso soup was room temperature and when we asked for fresh soup they just heated our bowls in the microwave. The tea had no flavour and tasted like plain water. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Lovely place. We arrived without reservation and despite being busy were promptly seated. Complementary miso soup greeted our cold bodies as the weather was frigid. We ordered California dragon rolls and lobster rolls. Food arrived quickly, beautifully presented and very tasty. Nice that such a place is steps from our home."}
{"text":"I got a lunch special of the spicy tuna and spicy salmon, it was really good, much better than what I got at the golden maki. I went to pick this up and the whole place was packed so that was the first indicator and then to see the chefs cranking the rolls out made me more excited. The resturant was very clean and nice Japanese decor. The rolls were good and like everyone else says they are big but I think that's a good thing. If I ever go back that way, this would be my go to place for sushi. I would love to try their specialty rolls, they looked great on their website. I recommend this sushi joint to anybody"}
{"text":"Everything about this location is amazing (food and service-wise). My partner is a sushi-lover and therefore very choosey when it comes to sushi; nevertheless, Mi-ne is his favourite place to eat it. The fish is always fresh, giving it amazing texture and taste. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere of the restaurant is relaxing, and there are several cozy private booths. Their service is also great. I have several food allergies (including shellfish and sesame seeds) and the servers and chefs have gotten to know me and my orders quite well. I can honestly say that no other restaurant has been so catering to my allergies. For someone with food allergies, going to a restaurant to eat can be very daunting as you are essentially gambling with your life. At Mi Ne sushi, I feel very safe. Not only that, but my partner and his family love this place as well, so it's nice when everyone can enjoy."}
{"text":"Back for more delicious Japanese food. I had the grilled chicken udon and the yam tempura roll again. I thought the udon would be a regular sized bowl but nooooooo.. the portion is huge with tons of toppings inside - veggies of all sorts, slices of grilled chicken, and onions. The udon came in a sizzling soup served in a stone pot and tasted delicious. If it's this good in the summer, I can only imagine how wonderful it would be in the cold of winter. I ate about half and 2 pieces of my yam roll before I was stuffed. The service again was super friendly. Yes, emphasis on \"super\". This is a good place to bring a date. The ambiance is not over the top but it's nice. Anyone wanna bring me here? :D"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I'm never disappointed. Their sushi is fresh and tasty.  There's a bit of variety.  Location is great with lots of private booths and staff are kind and helpful."}
{"text":"3.5/4. This is my second visit to Mi-Ne after visiting the Markham location. Overall, the lunch portions were a good value, coming with a miso soup and salad. There is also a lot of choices depending on what you are feeling (bento boxes, sashimi, rolls, nigiri and even deluxe combos). If you are a fan of seaweed salad, some of my co-workers upgraded and it was the fanciest seafood salad I've seen. The sushi was presented nicely and I like how the nigiri has wasabi already in it. The only complaint I have is the slow service."}
{"text":"Always good service and excellent quality fish! Best sushi place in Aurora, worth the price. Definitely recommend the golden dragon roll."}
{"text":"The Best sushi bar in GTA area and excellent customer service! Sushi was really fresh and rolls were big and thick. I definitely recommend you guys."}
{"text":"Arguably the best sushi place north of Major Mac.  We have come here 4 or 5 times so far. We have tried various dishes and many of the specialty rolls. The food quality has been consistently awesome. We have not once been disappointed.   A few things to note:  - You get you free green tea but there are no other freebies like little soups and salads that other places may have. Anything you put in your mouth that is not water or tea will show up on your bill.  - Prices, in particular those on maki rolls, seem to be quite a bit higher than those at other places. However, the rolls are HUGE so they SHOULD cost more. One roll may fill you up just fine.   - There are private booths alone the two walls, which is probably 60% of their sitting capacity. If you want a big of privacy for your table, there is a very high chance you'll get it at Mi Ne.   - The staff are helpful but not nosy. Each table is equipped with a button to page the staff if you need anything.  - A couple of very minor negatives, based on our recent visit: One of the plates had a small nick or chip on the side and the waiter didn't make much of an effort to bring our entrees to both of us at the same time (however, the delay wasn't that significant).   Overall, it is a very safe place to bring your friends to. They consistently make great food here."}
{"text":"Ughhhhh just so good! The rolls were decently sized. At one point I was concerned that my mouth wouldn't shut while chewing (thank goodness I was a loner in my car). Sushi Chef in Beeton is temporarily closed due a fire - so happy I found this place in lieu.  I've settled my sushi fix by coming here!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time visiting and have had a great experience on both occasions. First time was for dinner and today was for lunch. Both times brought my 1 year old son and the staff was super friendly and accommodating. The food is fresh and delicious. Had California rolls both times as well as tempura, miso soup and salad. Yummy! Had the green dragon roll the first time as well and it was delicious!  My hubby had a sushi lunch special today and loved the fresh salmon and tuna. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in all of Canada. Fish is moist, avocado is the perfect temperature, and rice is minimal."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent staff. Excellent food. Excellent Quantity. Excellent presentation. Pricing a little high but totally worth it for the amount of food you get and the quality of food. And the hello and goodbye greetings from the chefs each time you enter or leave the store has GOT to put a smile on your face. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Wow the food here is the best. And a decent price too.  Really fresh sushi. The Mi-Ne Zen combo contains lobster tempura and a big chunk of salmon as well as lots of sashimi and sushi pieces along whit miso soup and salad.  The food is enough for two people.  The service is prompt if you press on the button.  You sit in private booths for larger parties.  I would return here often."}
{"text":"Excellent quality sushi! A bit pricey but the portions are large! Very nice environment inside the restaurant and I enjoyed the private booths. The staff was very professional - the chefs looked terrific! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese sushi restaurant in Aurora. I have always been a fan of the Mi-Ne in Markham... so I was extra happy to see a Mi-Ne in my neighbourhood! If you looking for freshness, authenticity and simplicity... this is the place for you :) Quality is consistently good and the price is very reasonable. I love the semi-private booths and the nice decor - I especially adore the wooden/paper sliding doors when you walk in.  Mi-Ne serves Japanese and Korean food... so even if you don't enjoy raw food, there are plenty delicious hot foods to choose from. Sashimi is definitely very fresh. I really enjoyed the sashimi dinner set with 6 variety of fresh fishes... comes with soup and salad :) Fresh Vancouver B.C. uni (sea urchin) was available at my last visit... had to order a few! Distinct features of Vancouver B.C. uni is often sweetness, and not being fishy at all ^^ I also shared a plate of fried oysters with my date - 10 pcs for $15 - it was lightly battered, crispy, and tasted great with the house sauce.  Overall, a great place to satisfy your sushi cravings. Service is always polite and courteous. It is often very busy. I usually try to go later in the afternoon and before the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last week - didn't eat in but ordered a combination platter - 83 pieces of sashimi, sushi, and rolls for $92. Price is pretty on par with other a la carte Japanese restaurants but I liked how fresh the sashimi was. They serve the usual varieties of fish (salmon, snapper, butter fish, etc.) but the sashimi was cut in fairly large slices, which was great. The rolls are also the usual ones you'd get - California, spicy salmon, etc. - so don't expect anything too fancy, but I'd definitely recommend this place for the quality of the sashimi. I'll definitely come back and try dining in instead of takeout. And don't forget, pay in cash for 10% off!"}
{"text":"When it comes to Japanese restaurants up in aurora I usually don't have high expectations. But whenever I come to this mi-ne location their sashimi always taste fresh and their rolls are huge! I've been to all the mi-ne locations and this one if my favorite! I have never had any problems with the staff. They're all really easy to approach and is attentive with your order. The cooked dishes are decent and I wish the seating was more comfortable. 10% off if you pay cash!"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch with my mom during the week. Its a really cute place, we had our own little room which I thought was super cute. The service was great everything was quick and tasted fresh.  We had ordered : Mango Salad - this is HUGE! but amazing and everyone needs to try. Kalbi - SOOOOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS. end of story Lobster roll, shrimp tempura roll and a spicy salmon roll. To be honest, the rolls are HUGE. Almost too big, presentation is nice however because the rolls were so big I was unable to eat them in one bite thus being rather messy to eat.   Everything is A la carte, so our total came $75 which to me is a lot more expensive than your regular sushi. I feel like if you live in the area then you should at least try it once."}
{"text":"I love their rolls and sashimi. Their rolls have very thin layer of rice and sauce on them was great. Yummy :)  Great customer service too."}
{"text":"Came here with my coworkers during lunch and was seated immediately at a booth. Decoration and ambiance is nice. If I remember correctly, the waiters were wearing Japanese traditional clothing, which was really cute.   I got the lunch special with California roll and dynamite roll. It was about $16 which is a bit on the expensive side but the quality makes up for it.   The dynamite roll tasted fresh and unique - it was crunchy on the inside.   I would go back to try their sashimi. I'm more of a sashimi person!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food and great service. Food is quite pricey but it's always in a great quality and portion size."}
{"text":"The rolls seem so much more flavour-full, fresh and of a larger serving then the other sushi places I've been to.  Whether your getting take out or dining in, you'll have a great experience. The place isn't that big but it's very quant and everyone working there is extremely nice and eager to give you a great meal.  I recommend the green dragon rolls :)"}
{"text":"I have passed by this restaurant a number of times. It's in the same plaza as the Starbucks cafe that I always visit when I'm in Aurora.   I looked at the Yelp ratings for this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. I had to give it a try.   The restaurant has private booths. I was promptly seated in one. It's a nice touch of privacy.   I ordered gyoza as a starter. They were delicious, even though a prefer to eat then pan-fried over deep-fried.   I felt like noodles and went with for the seafood udon soup. It was boiling hot, to the point where the broth runners over. It was filling. You get lobster tail!  Of course, I saw cheesecake ad a dessert item and went with chocolate. It was so creamy and delicious. It wasn't heavy, which I appreciated.   It is pricy to dine here. However, the food quality explains why. I'd definitely come back and eat here.    (144)"}
{"text":"THE SERVICE IN THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE!!!! Dropped in to place a take out order and was told it would be an hour and twenty minutes before it would be ready. I placed the order, paid for it and returned when they said i should. Had to ask three different people to check and see if it was ready. Waited an extra 20 minutes once I got there. An hour and forty minutes for sushi?!!! So not worth it. Will not be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Not overly crowded like a lot of other Japanese restaurants out there, which is another reason why I like it here asides from the food. Not exactly the type of restaurant you'd expect to find in this part of town, so definitely a nice surprise. Note: there are 2 more locations that's not as North if you're not from the area. However, I personally like this location better as I found things and even the people to be more genuine.  It's a spacious and clean restaurant where booths are available; there are curtains so you can get a bit of privacy if you're here with a date. I wouldn't say it's good for large groups as it's not an overly loud place, nor have I noticed that large tables were available.  Personal fave is their stone bowl udon, which they are actually known for, so be sure to try that if you're here. Literally served bubbling and hot in a stone bowl, perfect to eat in cold weather or basically any time of the year if you're a soup and noodle fan. Their Udon is nice and chewy and not mushy like a lot places can get. Broth is nice and light and not overly salty. Their sushi and sashimi is also amazing (sushi rolls are huge so be prepared); freshness that you can actually taste (as weird as that sounds) and presentation is neat and clean.  Staff are very courteous and willing to assist you whenever, as is with most Japanese places, which makes your dining experience that much better. Service was also pretty efficient.   Basically if you're looking for a Japanese place with quality service and food, do pay this place a visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, wide selection, reasonable prices, nice Japanese theme atmosphere, and excellent service.  I love the lunch menu and lunch rates too"}
{"text":"One of the best chain sushi restaurants i have been to. The customer service was great, The fish was very fresh and the spicy tuna rolls are to die for."}
{"text":"Love their rolls, personal fav is the Orangeville role. Price might seem a bit high on the first glance but their rolls are gigantic, they will fill you up! I find it worth the price than many other restaurants. Service is good, they are quite busy so you have to be a bit patient sometimes."}
{"text":"Mi Ne Sushi in Aurora is as good as the one in Richmond Hill!  A mixture of Japanese and Korean items in the menu, so even if you are not int sushi, you will find something you like..  But why will you not enjoy the sushi here?! Especially with the Lunch Specials till 3 pm.  13pcs nigiri sushi  ($15) - All my sushi are lining up like solders when presented to me.. that's impressive - Selections are decent with (thanks god) only 3 salmons and a nice mixture of tuna, unagi, seared tuna, shrimp, white tuna.. etc - The fish slices are quite thick and well balanced with the portion of shari rice  The salad though has too much dressing on it...and the miso soup is lukewarm.  I love sushi!!  There are a lot of little private rooms. Just make sure you ring that bell on the wall if you need services, though the staffs check on me occasionally but if they are busy, you might be sitting in there for a long long time!"}
{"text":"We have visited Mi Ne in Richmond Hill and Markham and always enjoyed it. Today we tried out the location in Aurora. When we entered the restaurant it was very warm . We sat down and ordered . I asked if they could turn on the A/C  the waiter said it was on the highest setting . Not too sure if there system in broken or they just didn't want to make it comfortable for their customers. I would hope that the owners will get someone in to fix their A/C otherwise they are going to chase away their clientele. The meal was fine however it was difficult to breathe and could not enjoy our meal."}
{"text":"It is not all you can eat but one plate will completely satisfy you! The ribs soup (don't remember the name of the plate) is the best! The service is also very good! Be careful if you order an appetizer, maybe you wont be able to eat the whole plate later!"}
{"text":"Great specialty rolls, dine-in atmosphere seemed nice but i only got take-out. Probably the most upscale sushi joint around. The rolls we ordered were huge, and work as a main. If really hungry add a hand roll. Also they stay open a little longer than the other local restaurants which is nice!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi. The place was really buzzing last night. My family had four roles and a tempura appetizer and that was plenty. Really good miso soup. The table next to us had the love boat of sushi and it looked great. We are having that next time."}
{"text":"I really should get Frequent Dining Points for as often as i eat here. The Quality of the Sashimi is superior.the seared tuna sashimi is a must try not to mention the spicy tuna and spicy salmon all presented crafty.  The Sushi chefs are truly artists.   Tempuras are amazing, vegetables and seafood such as shrimp and lobster are tantalizing.  Don't be shy to try the Spicy seafood just the perfect amount of heat.    Too many fantastic rolls to chose fromYam, rolls, spider rolls all the way to signature rolls like Dragon Roll.   But please don't leave without trying the mushroom soup, Caution  it comes out boiling hot in a cast iron bowl.  Warning : Don't  be surprised if the person eating it gets so lost in its magnificent flavour that they don't hear a word that you say.  Just speaking from experience."}
{"text":"Portions are large. Maki rolls are typically 6 pieces at other sushi restaurants, but its 9 pieces at Mi Ne. The selection is decent, definitely not the largest but will offer something for everyone. The rolls are very good. The love boat is good value, will easily feed two people. We had the loveboat, spicy salmon maki and the spicy spider roll.  Spider roll was expensive but delish. Dessert selection was small, we tried the mango pudding which was made with fresh mango and was pretty good. Overall, not a cheap sushi place, but quality is good. Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"The food here is good. It is a little pricey, paying $50 for 3 rolls. The staff are friendly. If you order a roll that has raw fish on it the fish tastes very old. If you go a little more down younge street, AOI sushi is the best you will ever try."}
{"text":"Small Japanese restaurant in Aurora with its hits and misses... when I mean small the non-booth seats are tight. The service was kind of slow and a little below average. The food: the sushi, rolls, and kalbi was good and fresh. The miso soup seems authentic but lacking some ingredients. The tempura was a little heavy on the batter, expected something light.   Overall it wasn't a bad experience and the food was good, just some misses that lost its full 5 star rating."}
{"text":"It really distresses me to write this review. Mi Ne was, until today, a place I was excited to go to. They had a wonderful twist on the California Roll that I just loved... UNTIL TODAY. I ordered the California Lunch which is a Large Cali Roll and two pieces of the regular Cali roll. The Large California Roll adds Tamago (Egg) into the roll. Since Tamago is a favorite of mine I always gravitated to it. What I got today was utterly disappointing. I took pictures of it because I knew I would be writing about  it the minute I got home. The Crab, Avocado, Tamago and Tobiko were completely dwarfed by the amount of Cucumber in the roll, I would guess that a full 50% of it was Cucumber. I sort of joked to myself that they should rename this dish The Cucumber Lunch. In every bite of the thing the subtle notes of the main ingredients were completely upstaged by the Cucumber. I did not like this one little bit.   As you may know, I travel to these places with my handicapped son in tow. He is a major foodie himself and an expert at accessibility. Mi Ne has handicapped washrooms. However, someone who has no respect for people in wheelchairs has decided that the space required for the wheelchair to tuck in beside the toilet can be better used for storage. Now, I know there are laws against this in Toronto, not too sure about Aurora though. I will sending this information (yes, I took pictures) to the appropriate party at the City of Aurora for comment or action.  As we were leaving I noticed the \"People Love us on Yelp\" stickers on their door. I thought to myself \"Not any more\"."}
{"text":"This really is one of the best sushi places I've had.  Starting off about he sushi, because that's the start of the show. The sushi was delicious. The size of the rolls was quite large, and there are generally 9 per order. There is a lot of filling in them, and just the right amount of rice. You certainly get the quality of sushi you pay for!    Now overall about the night - there is lots of parking when you get there. They are located in a strip plaza thus easy to get to. The place is not very large and a popular spot thus if you don't have a reservation you may have to wait. There were 3 of us, all they had available was a small booth. It really was a 2 person booth, but we didn't mind. They tried to be accommodating so we didn't have to wait. Taking our order the server was very attentive to us. The only annoyance was that half our tables sushi came pretty quick, while the other came about 15 minutes later. The delicious sushi made up for the wait.   Overall we had a delicious sushi experience. Would defiantly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Favourite sushi place! My high school friends and I always come back here. The rolls are a good size.  Although lately, the food just doesn't taste as good as it did when it first opened."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!  One of my favourites in Aurora Newmarket area.   Sushi is always fresh and they have the most creative rolls and flavours.  Every time I come here I try to order something new as would like to get through their entire menu.  They have some private booths that has a drape or curtain to provide privacy which is funky.  Great service and always a great experience."}
