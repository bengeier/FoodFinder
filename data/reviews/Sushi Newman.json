{"text":"The quality is shockingly amazing for the price. I drive out of my way to come here! It's SOOOO good, so fresh always and they give extra food when you order amounts of $10/$20 and $30. Try it! Side note- it's now under the name of Sushi Newman :)"}
{"text":"This is my first review ever... the service their was so frustrating, it compelled me to do so. I'll tell you why I ordered sushi from this place after paying and tipping the driver I noticed they added delivery fee no problem but they did not mention that to me when I asked for the price on the first call  but I wanted to give the restaurant a chance to explain and if need be maybe compensate me in one way or an other. so I called to explain myself I told them if they're was a mistake on my bill or extra charge so the supervisor said in a firm condescending and uncaring tone, repeatedly \" thats the delivery charge there nothing i can do \" not even letting me speak cut me off many times he basically could not give a crap about his clients. To them we are just a bunch walking wallets So now the food. I guess it was ok but the rice was still warm from the rice cooker. so it was very meh! anyway I would not bring any of my friends or parents their, for sure, i love them too much for that!"}
{"text":"Good sushis, delivered in a timely matter. I ordered a la carte and did not get the advertised free sushis. I guess you have to begg for them. I will order again from them. I will simply choose a combo which is a lot cheeper."}
