{"text":"What a great place in Gastonia. So so many beers to choose from. So just start ordering and drinking. The wait staff was great with their suggestions. Food was very good. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Service was slow and lackluster. Kitchen staff didn't include all the components of my salad or dressing. Huge drink menu, but food was mediocre."}
{"text":"A lot of beer on tap. Burger was really good. 1.5x1.5inch piece of Mahi Mahi not worth the price."}
{"text":"Good food and beer selection.  Super slow service.  We had to go to the bar to get menus.  It wasn't busy.  Took 20min for the server to come to the table.  It's a shame because it's a promising place."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place five stars but the service was horrible. The atmosphere, beer selection and food were great. We were only one of five tables taken in the entire place on a Saturday afternoon, yet our waitress took 10 minutes to get our drink order and another 20 minutes for our food order. She was obviously new so we didn't mind but then she never came back for refills or a new beer order! In a place that specializes in having a huge variety of beer I expect her to come around when we have finished our beer and a great waitress will ask before it's completely empty. Instead we sat there with empty drinks for another 15-20 minutes. We finally gave up and asked the bartender for more drinks. We only saw our waitress again when our food came out. Which was upsetting when only two of us got our meals and we had a party of six! It was 15 minutes before my kids had their food! I will never be able to convince my husband to go back now and that's a shame because this could be a great place."}
{"text":"This was a great micro brewery.  I showed up on a Monday which is apparently trivia night.  I didn't partake in trivia, but a lot of.others did and seemed to have a great time.  I sat at the bar and had great service.  They had a great beer section and an amazing playlist.  The food wasn't bad either!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Ahi ahi Salad was very good and the kids loved the bacon cheeseburger. Tried the Hi-Wire Purple Punch - nice, tart beer. Loved the location."}
{"text":"Great location!!! Awesome old building, rich with history and a perfect place to try new beers! Food was great - had the chicken tenders and buffalo chicken dip."}
{"text":"Excellent beer list. VERY limited wine list (expected, but needs price range). Limited menu. Chef actually forgot to add a sauce.  Waitress was inattentive but she's probably still wondering why she only got a 10% tip- or she thinks we were just rude. I expect good service, dear.  My question is, \"Do u want to be a beer hall or a pub?\"  I'll come back later. Maybe you can get it all together."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday around 3pm. Very cool old mill building this business is located in. Very industrial and rustic vibe in the restaurant.  Our waitress was great, if I remember correctly her name was Mary Jane and she recommended this amazing coconut porter!!! It is my new favorite.  There are lots of beers to try, offer free samples and you can also purchase flights. As well as growlers, hence the name.
The atmosphere was very laid back and chill. Great place to chat over a beer with a friend.  Tried the pretzel appetizer with different dipping sauces. Would recommend. Also ordered the chicken and waffles, it stole the show. Was fresh and had a overall great flavor profile.  Will definitely be going back. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Very good beer and pretty good food. Love the atmosphere. My favorites food wise are the buffalo chicken dip (SO good) and the chicken tenders. The burgers are lackluster in my opinion, but it could have been an off night when I ordered one. The tater tots are also great. 

Hoping this place sticks around because it's starting to really live up to it's potential."}
{"text":"Omg the food the best I ever had so far since I moved her lord me and my girls was blessed to be able to come here and everyone is so polite and it didn't even take long for me and my 3 girls to be fed they even gave my kids coloring paper and crayons bathroom was very clean will be going back those wings made me fall in love"}
{"text":"This is an excellent addition to the growing Loray Mill Village. I live here and it's great to have a brewery with 100+ taps, pretty good selection of food, including bar food, salads, wraps, and a few signature appetizers. The staff tends to your needs, and are very knowledgeable about the beer list, which is ever-changing, with an average of 2-3 new brews added/changed. If you really like a beer/cider, you can get a 32 or 64 ounce growler to go! They have a great trivia night Mondays 7 to close. The wide open spaces and high ceilings are an awesome homage to the historic Firestone/Loray Mill."}
{"text":"Very nice place! 
The food is awesome with micro tap beer from all around the country.  GPS told me I was there but I had to find my way thru the old firestone mill.  You can drive around the back of the building to avoid the walk thru."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the deal is with this spot, so much potential.   Great atmosphere, great beer selection, beer ultra cold, food is great, they support Yelp with adverts and a check in offer (which goes a long way)........................................ 

Friday night, party of 11.  This was a friend's husband birthday part.    Got there around 7:30 pm.  We waited until 9 pm for a table, then we were seated with half at one table and half at another table across the room, after complaining, they moved another two tables together and we were able to sit together.   We waiting 20 minutes without be an acknowledgement from a server, ended up leaving and eating somewhere else.

Saturday afternoon around 3 pm.  On my way back from Shelby with a business associate.  Three other groups at tables in the joint.   Server greeted us with menus then disappeared for 15 minutes.   Ordered beers by beer number, in which the server wrote them down, but brought me the wrong beer.   I waited another 10 minutes for the replacement beer.   Ordered food, again, the server wrote the orders down.   The order came out wrong.

The owner has contacted me and hopefully this great potentially awesome spot can get their act together."}
{"text":"Service is way too slow, and it's not busy. Ordered were wrong. I have come 3 times hoping better but it always under delivers"}
{"text":"We went for the Friends & Family night! Hooray for Growler USA!!

I'm very excited about this second location in the Charlotte area. I am a frequent patron of the Ballantyne location and love the people running this place. Good people, good food, and good beer!

The location is gorgeous. It's in an old mill, so exposed brick, beam, some salvaged pieces from what it use to be. I love it. It's wide open, but not so much that its not warm & welcoming.

Let's talk about the food - SHORT RIB QUESO. It's amazing. I want to take it home in a growler. You don't even realize how much bread you've scooped it up with until the end when you're full and happy. Everything that we ordered was very good, and great flavors. I know that once they get the first opening tweaks taken care of, it'll all be fabulous. Do yourself a favor and find Matt, Amber or Aaron, then become their friend. Get them to show you the beer cooler - it's incredible! This staff is fantastic, and the place is really run by wonderful people. They've got 104 taps, so plenty for everyone's tastes (*cough* but drink Great Lakes though *cough*). Please go here. Gastonia is far, but not really. Go to here. Let me know when you go, and I'll join you. It's going to be great. #takemymoney"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in today for lunch. started with a light crowd but then built up just as 1:00 kickoffs were starting beers were nice and cold, so was the  Cabernet... it was generous pour, but red wine need not be chilled with the beers  (noted to the barkeep)
Burger was excellent!
Loved the reuben sandwich (a little light on meat)   but the flavor!  WoW!  
we will go again soon"}
{"text":"This place is cool - It's such a great location. They have 104 taps, which makes me happy on so many levels. And omg the food. The chicken and waffles are so so so so good, the short rib queso is like a beer cheese heaven. It's great, go here."}
{"text":"We didn't eat. However, our server was super nice, very knowledgable about the beers and the entire area and was genuinely friendly.  It was refreshing and the building is something else!"}
{"text":"We had so hoped for a new local place in Gastonia.  We have been a couple of times for lunch (did not want to base comments on one visit). The ambience is perfect for a brew pub, but every time we were there the place was virtually empty - the last visit was on a Friday afternoon.  Yes, there's a great beer selection and decent wine. But, the food is lacking!! As an example, the chicken tenders are always overcooked and taste of old oil. Overall, disappointing!"}
{"text":"Table of 7 waitress forgot to put in our order.  The rest of our table had finished by time or food arrived.  Food was very disappointing.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here for the second time tonight and yum! They haven't even had their grand opening yet but it was packed. If your looking for a great burger and fries or something healthier this place is for you! They will even make any burger low carb/gluten free by using a lettuce wrap! So nice to have a great new place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"So I love the location, but...I don't love the location. I'll explain. The space itself is a big beautiful warehouse space with exposed brick and massive high ceilings. But it's all the way around at the back of the building. There are small white signs (kind of like the ones realtors use) with arrows that direct you through a parking lot maze to Growler USA. 2-3 signs later you're there.

Inside is bright and airy with windows galore. Not that many patrons there for lunch time.

Our server was patient, provided beer samples to help make decisions and even tag teamed with the bartender at times.

The beer list is beyond extensive - plenty to choose from. Prices per pint start at about $5 and go up quickly from there. There is a Yelp check in offer for  1/2 off your first pint. It can take a while to decide! I did notice there were quite a lot of high gravity beers, which although they have gained in popularity I don't know that the demand for them (along with the higher cost) is that great; maybe too high of a percentage of their beer menu represented in this way.

The Pretzels with beer cheese and mustard selection was okay, but they sure looked an awful lot like Super Pretzels (the kind you see at Sam's Club). The Brewben had good flavor but the Corned Beef had been thrown on the grill which made it super tough and chewy.
Enjoyed being able to play Battleship with the Kiddos (+ the giant Connect Four).

Over all, I think it's a decent spot to grab a beer because of the sheer number of choices. They do have tap takeovers, and the prices are probably more reasonable then. I would not come here for the food though. Sorry. 3 stars on the beer side, 2 only on the restaurant.

I hope their lack of visibility doesn't hurt them in the long run."}
{"text":"The service and food was top notch. Best wings I have had a very long time. The service was spot on. The new place looks great. I hope they are there for a very long time."}
{"text":"Shea was amazing bartender got my recommendation for a citrus IPA just right. Great spot."}
{"text":"No doubt they have the best beer selection in town. But it feels like an after thought that they decided to serve food. The menu has limited choices which is fine if what they have they can execute well. My boyfriend got the burger and it was big and tasty. Lots of toppings and a good choice of beef. I however got the fish tacos and was not very impressed. They had two flour tortillas instead of corn which can be overlooked but two where totally not necessary. Especially considering the portion of the fish and toppings that was in each. Yes what I had was delicious but it was a tiny piece of fish in each taco. There was more tortilla on my plate then anything. The tots are great. So it seems like the food is hit or miss. I did not have any issues with the speed of the drinks or food coming out. The beer was great and the highlight of the meal. Both my boyfriend and I had a flight. 

The service was ok. It was odd that then our food was delivered to our table we didn't have napkins. We had to ask someone who wasn't our server to get some. But our waitress was very friendly. Upon reading the other reviews we placed our drink and food order at the same time and had no issues with waiting. 

The decor is very interesting. I understand a minimum look but it almost feels like the tables and chairs don't fit into the style of the room. This may sound like I am nit picking. But they have a beautiful brick wall and great windows yet the furniture makes it all look cheap and like they are just renting the space for the night and need to be able to tear it down quickly. 

This place is a great bar that just happens to sell food. Don't come for the food come to try the beer."}
{"text":"The place is absolutely amazing set up for this. It was designed marvelously. My boyfriend and I started with some amazing drinks and the buffalo chicken dip (which I will say it didn't come out until after our food came out and they didn't offer to take it off or sorry) but it was delicious with some heat (Franks red out if I'm not mistaken). He had the Brewben with the tots and I had the Mahi-Mahi tacos and both were delicious. I will also say I usually do not drink beer over 6% alcohol b/c I feel the flavor of it usually goes south but the Troegs Mad Elf 2015 was smooth and a extremely good beer to be so high of alcohol content. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim. It's Friday 6pm. ST.PATTY'S Eve. We had the days Specials... corned beef& cabbage worth mashed potatoes & Shepards pie. Both were lick your plate delicious! Our bartender Shea was a delight! The beer selection will satisfy even the pickiest of drinkers! Thanks so much, & see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Very nice atmosphe. Buffalo Chicken Dip was excellent. Nice selection of beers and ciders on tap. No liquor. Limited wine selection.

Food came out at an ok rate. Just had drinks and appetizers this run. The 5 oz. Size allows you to sample the extensive selection.

It is a little challenging to find. Just go around back of Loray Mill. There is limited parking around back.

Service is questionable.  That seems to be the continuing trend. You HAVE to get their attention. Waving a credit card works. 

Overall we will be back. Typical bar food. Nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.. wait time was a little long.. had the house salad with ranch.. very good, good size.. will be back"}
{"text":"When I sought out a brewery type vibe, I wouldn't have pegged this place, considering Gastonia. The ambiance was pleasing and it took you away for the typical Gastonia vibe. The device was awesome, very social and they made you feel like you were already friends. The beer was awesome, and there's so much to choose from. I'm not a huge beer person but I'm looking forward to going back and trying some more out. The food was alright. But the ambiance is what made the experience."}
{"text":"This was the second time we had been to this restaurant and found it delightful. Our server, Marina was excellent and very knowledgeable about the beer and was very helpful in making suggestions.  Our beer and food was served in very timely manner. The food could have been better, but the experience was great. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This was our second time at this location.  We live in Greenville SC and brought our friend from California.  The building is beautiful, lots of exposed brick and duct work.  The service was superb!  Our server, Marina was attentive and beyond knowledgeable of the MANY beer choices.  She was very patient in guiding us through the extensive drink menu.  The reason for the four stars was the food.  It was ok but not at the same level of the impressive beer menu and the phenomenal service.  Some of the reviews I've read state that the service was less than perfect.  Ask for Marina and she will do her best to make sure you have the best possible experience.  We will be back for the beer and Marina!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I'm gonna have to give only two stars. There weren't that many people at this location, I can't tell you how long it took for somebody to see me to even give me a menu or a glass of water.  I couldn't tell if they knew I was in the building. Now in all fairness to the one, yes one ,waitress that they had, what could she do with that many tables and just her. Either the chef/owner came by to see if everything was OK, I just didn't even answer. I wanted to say was no stop walking around looking pretty and pick up some menus in a water picture and whatever else you need to help your waitress and us. I kept the barbarian at bay and said nothing.  Sigh.

Got there at 1 o'clock and it took 2 and a half hours to get one order of wings and two beers. By the way, we were almost finished with the meal when we reminded the waitress that we were missing a beer. Up until that point we were both drinking mine we had to ask for the other. It's a brewery. They had three pages of choices for a beer. Do you think they would put more effort in actually trying to get the beer to you.

The wings. They obviously been sitting in the window for a while because we know what a fresh wing tastes like, don't we?? Not fresh. But not bad enough to send back and we were hungry.

Now here's something I learned, when I checked in with Yelp I was given an instant 50% off coupon off of my first draft. It said show it to the waitress when you check in. I did so. She said OK. We walked out not having redeemed our coupon because she forgot and my friend had already paid. Now what's annoying is this coupon was only good for 3 1/2 hours. If I ever went back I would have asked them to honor it but I doubt that I would go back."}
{"text":"Was very excited to see this place open.  Saw food reviews on Facebook but did not check yelp before I went.  Arrived around 630 on Wed night, was seated promptly.  Atmosphere was great, hostess and servers were very friendly.  Excellent selection of beer on tap.  5 stars for everything except the food.  We ordered wings and fish tacos.  The wings were not good and undercooked which may have been why they did not taste very good.   They were comped and offered some more for free which I thought was great but did not take them.  The kitchen staff then brought out a delicious piece of chocolate cake which I appreciated their efforts.  

Now the fish tacos.   The corn taco shells tasted awful, the only thing that was good about them was the fish inside it.  

So we were completely disappointed with the food.  2 stars for the food we ordered.  

We will try again in the future and hopefully have better results as we like the place and would definitely go back for the beer on tap."}
{"text":"Huge craft beer selection and very knowledgeable bartenders.  Highly recommend the buffalo chicken dip!"}
{"text":"Great wings and beer. I haven't branched out too far in to the menu because I am a wing nut but the wings were fantastic. I have been to dozens of wing places since moving to NC and this place was hands down the best."}
{"text":"\"We can't seat you because the kitchen is closed\" are not the words you want to hear at 8pm on a Friday night while staring at 5-6 open tables. 

Shame that it looks so nice inside too. :(.

Responding to response:  It was though. That's what we were told by the hostess.

Response x2. Actually. That wasn't us. We were told the kitchen was closed and to wait. We never sat down. We waited for 15 minutes and left without ever being seated."}
{"text":"Hoping to update my review and go back for a second try after their grand opening. We went this past Friday for my husband's birthday and wish we went somewhere else. We arrived around 7 and waited a few minutes to be seated. There were four of us and we decided to order an appetizer of hummus... it arrived to our table (after some complaining) around 8. I looked around while we were waiting on our food, and realized that only one table in the entire restaurant had food at their tables. Our food finally arrived at 9pm. Unfortunately my 6 month old was exhausted by this point and I had to walk around to keep him calm. My food was cold within minutes and chicken and waffles just aren't good cold. Defintely understand that they are still working out their kinks so we'll try again in a few months. Fingers crossed!"}
