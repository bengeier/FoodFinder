{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!  Mohammed is a wonderful host - so warm and personable and gave perfect suggestions for us.  The hummus is the best and the friend cauliflower is quite the treat.  We had the shish tawook which was perfect (comming from my husband who grew up eating great arabic food).  Prices here are very reasonable which allowed us to try many different things.  The restaurant is situated facing the parking lot instead of the road so it is a bit tricky to find the first time but well worth the effort.  I live two hours away and would just might make the trip to eat here again."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in mediocre food. Falafel was dry and salty, salad was pretty much iceberg, soup kind of slimy without much taste, hummus bland, pita had stiff parts as if overheated in a microwave and check was wrong. Will not return."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall- ok, it's a space in the basement of an office space, which is totally bizarre- but it's a regular spot for us.

Love: the hummus, falafel, feta cheese, and  the amazing lemon-garlic salad dressing! 

Don't love: the baba ganouj- it's just got a weird flavor- I prefer Aladdin's baba."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Excellent service.  This is definitely a restaurant I would visit again and again.  I'm still thinking about that gyro..."}
{"text":"Absolute gem of a restaurant for decades.  Might be my #1 in pittsburgh.  Get the mezza platter."}
{"text":"We went here last night for the first and it was delicious! Came in and ordered just baklava and grape leaves and the staff was completely okay with that. The service was excellent and our waitress extremely personable. The food came in small portions but was still definitely worth the price - would go back!"}
{"text":"Its always nice to find a restaurant serving authentic cuisine and fresh food with people who obviously takes pride in what they do. Based on yelp reviews, this was our 'new place of the week' for a friday dinner. Very warm and friendly waiter ( manager?) who made us feel very welcome. The food tastes very flavorful. Had the chicken shwarma, majadara and rice pudding. I will make a special mention of the baba ghanoush. The best i have had."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Family-owned and the food is excellent. Very friendly and attentive staff. I've been here 6 times now and it has been wonderful every time. I've tried the Chicken Shawarma, Beef Shawarma, Falafel Sandwich, Taboule Salad, Lentil Soup, Jalepeno Hummus and they were all fantastic. It truly is a hidden gem in North Scottsdale. Very reasonably priced as well. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I learned about this place through Yelp and figured I would give it a shot. Not only was I blown away by the food but the owners were very nice and really seem like they care about their business and customers. The place is owned by brothers and even have their own mother cooking in the kitchen.
It is hard to find a Lebanese place in Scottsdale that is truly authentic and tastes fresh. My usual go to Mediterranean place is Pita Jungle, but I will make the extra drive to come back here next time I am craving some jalapeno cilantro hummus!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants and hidden gems in the city. Med grill offers authentic Lebanese cuisine and mouth watering dishes that have you coming back for more! Chicken fattoush salad is amazing. The family owned business makes it nice to see a familiar face when dining there. The service is great and food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Do you love lamb, schwarmas, or hummus?  This is the place to be.

Start with the fried lemon cauliflower or an order of hummus with olive oil dribbled across for an excellent beginning.  For lunch, their sandwiches are priced well and delicious.  Instead of stuffing a pita with ingredients that explode all over the place, they wrap them fully and panini them close for easy eating; fantastic idea.

For specialities, try a few Kibbe bites.  Balls of beef fried with a mixture of spices that fit perfectly with an order of their cucumbers & yogurt dish.  Just drop the kibbe right in, it's a great mix!

I've been on a number of occasions and have always had fantastic service.  Great food and atmosphere keeps me coming back so it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my girlfriend last night, and, well, there's something not right with this place.

We both enjoyed our food. We got the Baba Ghannouj to share and liked it. An unexpected smoky taste, almost like barbecue sauce, but enjoyable nonetheless. My girlfriend got a falafel wrap, pretty average. I got some meat items off the A la carte menu, and they were really good, cooked to medium just as requested. I also got a glass of the mint iced tea and quite liked it. 

However, the service we received was abysmal. Normally, that wouldn't really bother me - sometimes you go to a restaurant and you get bad service. Besides, the quality of the food is really what I'm concerned with when going out to eat. But the reason I bring this up and the reason the terrible service angered me, is that over the course of our meal, it became clear that my girlfriend and I were receiving substantially different service than the other customers in the restaurant.

Everyone else seemed to be getting the standard gracious and considerate treatment of a professional waitstaff. We felt as if, in the eyes of the staff, we were barely there. 

First, we were seated without menus or the complementary bread. When both arrived a few minutes later upon request, we then had to wait another 10 or 15 minutes before a waitress came over to take our order. We noticed that other tables seated after us were able to place their orders first. When the Baba Ghannouj came out as our appetizer, it came without additional bread (never had this happen in a Mid Eastern place, and we saw that other customers were not treated as such). After we finished the complementary bread, not once did anyone offer, or simply take the initiative, to bring out some more. Again, never seen this happen in any restaurant that provides complementary bread - though we saw other customers receive a second heaping of bread, no questions asked.  

Our main course finally arrived. Or rather, mine arrived, and my girlfriend had to wait several more minutes for hers. Basic restaurant etiquette would say that you aim to serve a couple at the same time. Don't want to put one person in the uncomfortable, potentially rude position of eating while the other stares, right?

When hers came out, we both dug into the food, and like I said above, enjoyed it. But as more time elapsed, I started to notice other little things in terms of the service. We spent about an hour at our table last night. Not once during the hour did anyone offer or act to refill our waters. Not once were we asked \"Hey, how's everything? How's the food?\". Not once did the waitstaff suggest we purchase more food. Hell, when we were served, the waitress barely made eye contact with either of us. It felt as if she wanted to minimize her interactions with us as much as possible. 

Again, the staff seemed amiable and affable with all others in the restaurant. For some reason, my girlfriend and I were pariahs.

Once it was clear we were done with our meal, that's when the service went into turbo drive. Our waitress came over, asked if we were done and if we needed a take-home box. She immediately said she'd get the check, not probing us to see if we would be up for coffee or dessert. Back and forth she went, grabbing bags, boxes, and the bill, with a speed that was wholly absent for the past hour. 

Finally, before paying the bill, I asked to speak with the manager. One of the waitresses came over (she's part of the family who owns the place) to hear our grievances. We talked with her a bit, though she eventually got agitated as we pointed out how we received sub-standard service. Another waitress then came over (note: neither were our primary waitress, but we noticed that since the place was fairly small and fairly crowded, the three of them were pitching in wherever they could. Except with us.) to continue the conversation. She heard us out more than the other. 

As I detailed the examples of poor service throughout the evening, she had a convenient answer for everything. We were out of menus when you were seated. It's busy, so we lost track of you for a bit. Other people ordered pre-made items, that's why their food came out so fast. In her view, it was a string of coincidences that led to the misperception that we were treated any differently. But as we pressed her further and insisted that we received substantially different service, she changed her tune. When my girlfriend brought up that no one even made eye contact with her during the night, we were told it was because we had been rude and had given off a rude vibe early in the meal.

I was blown away. They came over so little, that we didn't even have the opportunity to be rude. I acted no differently than I have at any restaurant I've been my entire life. This was all new to me. That's when it hit me. My girlfriend is Chinese. Everyone else at the restaurant was white."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten Lebanese food in the Middle East, in London and on the West Coast. This restaurant's food is outstanding. Their humus was absolutely delicious and the portion was very generous. The falafel was perfect and not at all greasy. We shared a gyro sandwich straight from the rotating grill. Once again, a taste treat and it proved more than sufficient for two. The meal was topped off with a piece of pistacchio baklava and a rice pudding, both delicious. The service was friendly and professional. It is a family affair and well done. Without a doubt we shall return often."}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Mediterranean Grill for years. The grilled chicken is out of this world. The rice, mujahdrah and salad are the side dishes I enjoy the most. I often buy catering size portions and make plates at home that i freeze for meals throughout the month."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hidden in a basement location near Pussycat and The Chocolate Moose in Squirrel Hill. The food was pretty good--not spectacular, but good enough. We had the mezza platter (hummus, baba ghannouj, tabboolee, feta cheese, and olives) and falafel. Hint: if you plan to order this, save the warm pita your server brings you for your dinner. The baba tasted a bit too smoky but the falafel and tabboolee (the restaurant's spelling) were pretty good. The falafel was crispy and delicious. You'll see the option of ordering feta fries on the menu. We did this out of curiosity but probably wouldn't again. This is American-cut fries sprinkled with feta. Only in Pittsburgh can you order fries with Middle East cuisine. With cheese on top. Only in Pittsburgh.

Anyway, it was a decent vegetarian dinner and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Arabic restaurant in Squirrel Hill. The food was amazing and the service and staff were nothing short of amazing!! You can tell the food is cooked with love and they truly care for their patrons. My waitress Jessica was very informative and patient being that is was our first visit. We loved her! The restaurant was very clean and chic! I have recommended this place to many of my friends and will definitely be back myself!! If you're in the mood for delicious authentic Lebanese food, look nowhere else!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED THIS RESTAURANT and will definitely be returning on a regular basis!! The chicken shawarma is incredible, and the service is excellent. This is by far the best food I've had in the entire Scottsdale area. The food is FRESH and has FANTASTIC FLAVOR. Be sure to save room for a delicious baklava desert!"}
{"text":"A true hidden gem in pittsburgh! The food is outstanding! Must try the veggie grape leaves- best I ever had. The owner makes all of the food herself and orders food fresh daily. The business is family owned and operated which makes for a nice family oriented environment!"}
{"text":"Not bad...
The falafel is definitely a highlight -- much better and fresher than that of Aladdin's, but the atmosphere is terrible. Too many mirrors, and the building it's in feels like a dentist's office. Some of the waitresses are also terrible and SLOW.

And the bev selection bites. No mint tea. Meh."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant.  The hummus is silky smooth and is perfectly seasoned.  It also had an interesting flavor that sets it apart (and above!) other versions I have had at other restaurants.  Several flavors of hummus are available.  The grape leaves are tight, warm rolls that have a nice mint flavor.  I also tried several sandwiches that were very good.  I will definitely make it back for dinner to check out the entrees.  Great service, great prices - it is nice to have a quality Mediterranean restaurant in the neighborhood.  It is locally owned and operated too, which is nice."}
{"text":"Food was good. Atmosphere and service? Not at all. 
Service was terrible. There was only one other family when we were there. We were waiting quite a long time for our food to come out. Not a single time anybody came to give us refills for water, or asked about pita bread for our appetizer. They brought our bill while we were still eating. We never return. There is Turkish Kabob house and Aladdin's close by with great food and SERVICE to get our Middle Eastern cravings fixed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Middle Eastern food, head down the stairs at this address, deal with the sub-par ambiance, and eat here! The worst  thing about this establishment is the space. It's in a basement of what is basically an office building -- and it looks like an emptied out office with tables and chairs and dim lighting. The acoustics, as a result, are also bad. But getting beyond that, the food is great. I love their chicken salad for lunch (the dressing rocks!). Their veggie grape leaves are also outstanding. My mother loves the fattoush salad. The waiters have always been friendly and accommodating.

I think the debate about this restaurant vs. Aladdin's up the street is a moot point. Although the food genre is the same, the two establishments have very different feels, as well as different menus, and I think it's nice to have variety within the same ethnic food option.

One other qualm I have about this place is the pita. It is flat and dry and tasteless. Having lived in the Middle East, I know what good pita tastes like, and this doesn't come close. However this is not dueto the cooks in the kitchen at Mediterranean Grill. This restaurant -- along with every other Middle Eastern place I've tried in this city, including Aladdin's -- gets its pita from the same distributor. I think they should demand better or make their own. When I go, I generally don't eat the pita and stick to the stuff that makes me leave wanting more!"}
{"text":"Only in Squirrel Hill. A hole in the wall with outstanding ethnic cuisine. My third or fourth time here and it's the same every time--fresh ingredients, authentically prepared, large portions, served piping hot. Zero atmosphere, prices on the high side, but flat-out great Lebanese. Gyro slices come out looking a little like Beef Jerky, but still tasty."}
{"text":"I like this place more than Aladdin's, which is also on the same street.

The Red Lentil and Potato soup is delicious. I get it everytime.

The hummus is very, very good. Rich but not overwhelming and flavorful. 

The Moussaka (please forgive my spelling) is very tasty and the Chicken Schwarma is wonderful, with a reall grilled flavor.

The main con is that it is a bit on the expensive side and the location is kind of odd (in the basement of an office complex, next to a nail salon, I think)."}
{"text":"Off. The. Chart. - Super Huge Value

I love these guys.

Find this place.  Then come back and eat again with two friends, then they'll tell two friends, and they'll tell two friends, and they'll tell two friends...

This family-owned restaurant serves great, hot, home-made recipie Lebanese food.

Super friendly.

They remember your name from the first time they meet you.

Really lucky these guys moved into the North Scottsdale neighborhood - in the Airpark by KO Donnell's - just south of Home Depot - behind the old Salty's.

Check them out!"}
{"text":"We've been back several times and very sorry to say the last time, there was a sign on the door that it was closed indefinitely.  Very sad, one of our favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you want Authentic cuisine from the Mediterranean regions. The owner is very friendly and is available to answer any questions about the items. They use High quality ingredients and the service is amazing."}
{"text":"I was stoked to try this new authentic Lebanese restaurant in North Scottsdale! I haven't had good, let alone great, Lebanese food in eons since I left Pittsburgh, PA, in 1990! (Okay, just once in all that time, and it was in Montreal (the same folks who catered Celine Dion's wedding)! A little too far to visit on a regular basis.)  Now, I have found my go-to place when I crave all my favorite  Lebanese goodies - like hummus, babaganoush, stuffed grape leaves . . . and the choices go on!

Originally, we were just ordering take-out, but the owners, two of three brothers, were there and offered us some samples of their dishes. I was blown away by the smoky, flavorful babaganoush. It was not pureed to pieces so you could still enjoy the texture of the eggplant as well. My husband wolfed down the roasted red pepper hummus and was smacking his lips the entire time -- best he ever tasted. I am always up for trying something new, and we received a small dish of Majadara which is steamed lentils and cracked wheat mixed with onions, a Lebanese traditional dish that I never tried or even heard of before. Mmmm, it was delicious . . . lovely texture, seasoned just right . . . a perfect combination of protein and carbs . . . great as a meal on its own for lunch!  We chatted for quite a while with owners Tater and Mohammed, asked about how they got into the restaurant business, how they arrived in Scottsdale, and learned more about their chef, who is also a butcher and does his own meat! They were all so friendly and really excited about bringing their family recipes and homemade Lebanese to Scottsdale. 

Our take-out was ready! We ordered the original hummus, baba, fried eggplant, grape leaves with meat and rice, and the mixed grill. I was so full from the samplings, I had to wait a couple hours before I could begin to take a bite of the food we brought home! The hummus is creamy and no overwhelmed by the taste of tahini. A little bit of olive oil drizzled in the mix as they advised at the restaurant made it simply divine.  I don't even need the pita . . . I could just eat this by the spoonful, along with the baba as noted above.  The fried eggplant was a surprise. I guess I was expecting something like fried zucchini, with breading, but instead this was more like sauteed with lemon garlic sauce. Yum! 

The grape leaves were tightly rolled, like little cigars, and served hot! I haven't had grape leaves with meat in them in a very long time . . . and maybe not ever in Scottsdale. They were the creme de la creme in my experience, just as I remembered those 20 years ago in Pittsburgh.  It was quite funny because my husband only knows grape leaves as \"dolmades\" which is Greek. When he ordered, the self-proclaimed \"white\" girl behind the counter taking our order didn't have a clue what it was he was ordering. Anyway, no where on the menu was the word dolmades, only grape leaves . . . guess you had to be there for the looks on both their faces.

The Mixed Grill was a savory, well-seasoned, very tender mix of Kabob, Kafta and Tawook, served with various veggies over rice. It came with a side salad . . . which as of last night, we were both too tired and full to dig into, so maybe later.The Kafta was extraordinary! And I am not a meat eater by any means. My husband dug all the way in and polished off everything, except some of the rice which surely he will gobble up today!

Before we left the restaurant, Temar gave us a couple pieces of baklava to satisfy our sweet teeth! And as we were already out the door, the very friendly chef came running after us to give us a little taste of the kabob meat he just cooked up! Oh we were so happy . . . and in such a food coma!  Tummy full, nap now!

Without a doubt, we will be back to The Mediterranean Grill.  I only wish we lived close enough to take advantage of their 5-mile delivery option. Truly a very pleasant, satisfying foodie experience! Try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This place is BAD ASS!!!

I eat here pretty often considering it's right by my new office. The guys that own/run the place & their employees are nicer than most people in Scottsdale. 

The food.... THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!! They grill their sandwiches, (a grilled gyro? = heaven!) they use FRESH ingredients, all in all - they do it right. 

The prices aren't that bad either. Sure, you can go to Tempe and get a gyro with fries for $6.99 and it's alright. This is a much healthier, tastier option for around $10 including a drink. 

If you're in North Scottsdale shopping around this ridiculous shopping center, check them out. They're a little tucked away, right by a smoke shop off Northsight on Butherus. 

Try the jalapeno hummus!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday after a long drive that had my appetite built up. I ordered baked kibbee with cucumber yogurt and also rice pilaf. Overall I thought the food was really tasty and worthy of a 4-star rating. I particularly liked the kibbee as it is certainly exotic and not something you can just find anywhere even among other middle eastern venues. The service was good too as my server was friendly and outgoing. The only minor issue is the location, which is below street level within a residence like hallway. The price seemed a little high but not to the point of being ridiculous. The important elements however, such as the food and service were very good and thus earns an overall 4-star rating."}
{"text":"Meh

Appetizer mezza platter was decent with baba ghanoush, olives, and feta cheese

Mixed platter was pretty bland. It was an unexciting and impassionate plate of rice with 5 pieces of lamb and 5 pieces of chicken. 

Baklava was average

Venue was nice 

Somewhat overpriced 

Turkish grille is where its at"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Followed recommendation of waiter.  Really an excellent value."}
{"text":"First time visit today. Had the tenderloin tips with hummus and lentil soup. Soup was very good. Tips and hummus just blew me away.  I will be back"}
{"text":"I usually go there for the shish kabobs. This time the owner convinced me to try the lamb shank. The lamb, that was moist and falling of the bone, was served with rice, and a bowl of sauce that is filled with Mediterranean spices. It was a generally good dish, but when you mix the rice with the sauce and meat, it was a whole new experience and the dish instantaneously become my favorite."}
{"text":"Mmm what can I say, the red lentel soup is my favorite, along with the meat grape leaves, I was never a fan of hummus till I tried it here, the owner makes it fresh, amazing !!!!! The baklava even better :) love this place. Jesse is always a great waitress, we eat here often."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best middle eastern in the midwest. I visit pittsburgh almost twice a year, and I can't not go there. It tastes just like mom's food!!!!! Can't wait to go back for more
-hb"}
{"text":"Really good Mediterranean food.
The hummus appetizer is excellent.
Our lunch items also included a gyro sandwich and a tabbouli salad.
They were both very fresh and very tasty.

Our service was great.
We will definitely be back.
The food makes up for the strip mall location and lack of interior decor."}
{"text":"We happened on this little cafe by accident.  It's really unassuming and in the shadow of a large fitness club.  The food is great.  Tasty and very fresh.  The owner and servers were incredibly friendly and helpful.  I had to write this review after reading the review that said that the service was poor.  We had the complete opposite experience.  The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome.
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"BEST MEDITERRANEAN FOOD IN PITTSBURGH !  Have been going here for almost a year now and I'm literally addicted ! awesome service and even better food. Family owned and always fresh great choices! must must must try !!!!"}
{"text":"WOW. My husband and I just enjoyed a delectable meal with great service. I love family restaurants! Tamar was our server, and he obviously takes great delight and passion in the food. We ordered fried cauliflower, and it was crispy and delicious in a light lemon sauce. We got two gyro sandwiches, which were panini style with a thinner bread than your typical pita. Beautifully crispy, and the flavors melded wonderfully. Husband is still raving about it. Nothing was super greasy, and the flavors were perfectly mixed. Husband says he's looking forward to burping some up so he can taste it again, that's how good it was. Tamar even gave us complimentary tastes of the bak lava, which had a divine texture and not-too-sweet flavor. We'll be back to try the rest of their dishes!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! We got the hummus trio with the pita bread. The Pita was nice and thin, and not greasy (the left overs were still great 3 days later). Got the Mediterranean salad which was extremely fresh and very light but vibrantly flavored without going over the top. For our dinners my wife got chicken Shwarma and I got Shish Tawook. Very generous servings, and the chicken was moist and tender. Did I mention the hummus? I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Squirrel Hill, maybe the city.  Its hidden down some stairs on Forbes, you have to look for the little neon sign in the window - but its definitely worth the trip.

The restaurant has excellent, but pricey ($15-20) full dinners of skewers of chicken, beef, etc. that come with rice and a salad with delicious dressing, and it also has a ton of cheaper options for lunch or dinner.  There are pita sandwiches and you can get things a la carte.  I love to mix and match different a la cartes every time I go.

I personally love the spinach lentil and red lentil soups, the vegetarian grape leaves (you get like 8 or so, its a good amount), and the hummus.  The large salad with grilled chicken is also another well-priced and delicious meal.  Portions are generous.

Also, the place is family-owned and the service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Just discovered this gem! Best hummus in Town, had the Kofta sandwich, french fries (fresh tasty fries) and a side of the red pepper hummus...YUMMMMM! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I don't give many 5 star reviews, but this place is fantastic. We loved everything about it from the decor to the food. 

First thing to note is they moved across the street. Someone should update Yelp because it's confusing. They did a nice job updating the new space. It's clean and homey. 

The salad was delicious, especially since we added the feta which was fresh and delicious. They had some lunch specials, which was really nice. I had the filet kabobs and they were tender and delicious. The red sauce that comes with it is everything. My husband loved the gyro platter too. The meat was tender and delicious. The buttered rice pilaf was good too. 

The staff is really nice and accommodating. Come check it out! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A wonderful find! Delicious Mediterranean food at a local, family-owned restaurant. I will be a regular customer... Way to go, Mo!!"}
{"text":"Great food great service. This a family run place and they make you feel like family"}
{"text":"The best fattoush I have ever had.  A true Pittsburgh gem.  

Great service, great food and great prices."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Atmosphere not what I would consider very clean. 
Service was terrible. 
Only one other family in there. 
No refills, asked for pita bread for our appetizer of humus 3 separate times. Brought our bill before we received the pita. 
Then never came back to collect payment.
Just left money on the table and plan on never returning."}
{"text":"Love everything I've had here.  Marisa is a fan too.  Kafta and gyros are great, fresh-cut fries also terrific.  Table service instead of queuing at the counter.  I'll be trying the baklava after I'm down a few pounds.  Today I had the chicken shawarma and ask Tamer to put a little hummus it too. It was really outstanding and Panini press as well which was nice surprise perfect crisp crunchy texture on the outside everything inside terrific, it even has slivers of pickled radishes in it that are great.  And as an extra bonus they have stupid fast free Wi-Fi here 38Mbs.  The brother owners Tamer & Mohammed are doing a great job.

btw, my chicken shawarma looked so yummy that I would have taken a picture for yelp.  But I devoured it instead :-(

update 1/3/12, joy of joys, they have beef shawarma today!  It too was terrific.  Wi-Fi is still stupid fast at 29Mbs down / 39Mbs up unlike the Starbucks that I just came from."}
{"text":"This place is great, I have been a few times, not as many as my hubby, though.  It is a small family owned restaurant and the food is delicious.  The first time I had the gyro and my hubby had the Kafta.  They came toasted, YUM.  I tried my hubby's and it was delicious, too.  Last time I had the chicken shawarma and the mediterranean salad.  The twins had the hummus plate and chicken.  They were nice enough to split it and make sure that each item was separate, my little boy is a little bit of a freak about mixing his food.  The family is so nice.  I have so many more dishes I want to try.  Next time I think I want the Majadara, sounds delicious.  I love lentils.  I guess I should try the lentil soup before it gets too warm for soup time."}
{"text":"If I could give it more stars I would. Being part Lebanese I tried this restaurant for the first time and was blown away. It is authentic  Lebanese food and every bite was great. And they also treat all customers like family! My new favorite restaurant, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming food.

My gyro platter was just okay. It came w/ a tomato-based sauce that I thought didn't go well w/ the meat. Asked for a side of tzatziki sauce instead but the flavor wasn't very good.

Don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"My co-workers raved about the food so I went. 

That being said, the guy in front of me had been waiting for 30 minutes for a gyro (he left FURIOUS) so I did an order of lentil soup to go so I could get my food quickly (to avoid driving to another place).  The place wasn't busy.  25 minutes later, I had my soup to go ($5) and it was in a 10oz container not all the way full....more like a cup of soup. 

I got back to my desk and it wasn't even lentil soup......the soup tasted like lemonade with salt.  

No \"I'm sorry\" or anything for the wait...I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, but even more because it is family owned and prided. I find that refreshing and the love definitely comes out in the fabulous food! This is a great and popular place for anyone who loves mediterranean food that is AUTHENTIC! I also know the family that owns this establishment is equally as FABULOUS!"}
{"text":"Really love their food. LOVE LOVE LOVE their salad, gyro meat, chicken, hummus...ok, the whole menu. I would have to say, picking only one item to favorite, it would be the salad. LOVE the feta and the dressing. It's always fresh
The lighting is bright. There is usually a consistent flow of people dining in and ordering out. It could use a little makeover regarding the décor. But the food makes you comfortable regardless.
They are a BYOB which is great. 
My one criticism, which is more me than them...It is in the basement of a small building in the middle of Sq. Hill. I also can't bring my mom as she can't do the steps that are quite steep. I personally don't like hanging out long after a meal, as I'm in the basement of a building. I would love to see a window. I would love to linger...outdoor seating would make this the greatest dining experience."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times and I have had take away too. The food is ok - nothing more, nothing less. It has a fairly small selection compared to other Mediterranean places in the city and it is overpriced for not any particular reason. I will certainly not be going there again unless if someone else wants to (i.e., I won't object to it but I won't go with my initiative)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! My family and I not only love the food but also the staff and how kid friendly the establishment is in general. It's always a great night when we go there and make a whole evening out of it in squirrel hill. We have yet to be to the new store front but are excited to get there!! Recommended to anyone looking for amazing Mediterranean food and great vibe!"}
{"text":"At Med Grill you can BYO (save big $$ - couldn't say if there is a corking fee but if so it's like a buck or two). The Lamb shank is really good at Med Grill and I like the Kibe (baked and raw - did I spell \"kibe\" correctly?). If you don't know what it is you should go and ask about it. Go raw for an adventure. When you go to Med Grill you descend stairs what appears to be like an underground office space (kind of weird) and surprise there is the Med Grill. No windows eww...but great service ...but  the decor is just ok... but I am giving it 4 stars mainly for the BYO and good food."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3.5 stars mainly because the stuffed grape leaves were amazing. They came out and were surprisingly hot (temperature-wise)! I'd go back to have those grape leaves again. We also got a shawarma wrap and a falafel wrap and they were ok, but nothing special. I wish they had better sauces. The baklava was good, super sweet, but they give you a very small piece (good or bad thing depending on your perspective) so it's not overwhelming.

The service was not that great. We had to ask for lots of things, and there was this feeling that we were being rushed out, when we wanted to order dessert.

Ambiance was average. It was kind of fun finding this restaurant though. The underground location makes it feel more special."}
{"text":"the wife and i enjoyed this place so much during our courting days that we stopped in while passing through town.  it was just as good as we remembered.  the mezza platter is a great starter with humus, babaganoush, tabbouleh, feta and olives, served with warm pita.  practically a meal in itself.  the only complaint i have about it was that on this particular night, the babaganoush was a bit too strong on the lemon.
i had a shawarma wrap, which was excellent.  (happy coincidence, the babaganoush was a perfect flavor complement to the shawarma.)  the wife had the falafel and was very pleased-- said it was perfectly crisped on the outside and tender and moist inside.  we had enough to take a bit of it with us when we left.  also, our server, rachel, was incredibly helpful and attentive, without being up in our business.  she seemed to be happy in her job a friendly with all of the customers.  that always makes for a nicer dining experience, in my book."}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern food I have had anywhere in the US.  The sleek is heavenly goodness.  Do they put crack in their salad dressing?  It is addictive.  Baba is deliciously smokey.  Though I haven't had their mousakka, my family raves about it.  Cozy hole in the wall.  Cannot say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"I really don't get all of the 5 star reviews. This place has good food but their prices are  astronomical. I had a $35 dollar lunch with my son. I had a lamb shank and he had a chicken wrap and we had some hummus.

The lamb was good but very puny as far the meat goes. So if $17 lunches per person  are in your comfort zone, then party on!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place, but I'm gonna.  My family and I have been going to this place for 15 years or so. It is the BEST MIDDLE EASTERN food in the BURGH! I have a bunch of favorites. The Mixed Grill is to die for, along with the Grape Leaves. The Hummus and Baba is off the charts as well. If you are a fry lover, this is the place to go. The fry's come out golden brown and piping hot, it's almost like being at the Potato Patch in Kennywood. The service is outstanding, they are sweet and kind and quick to get your food out. I'm looking forward to the new location!"}
{"text":"The place was OK but the hospitality and food were good. I ordered falafel and full justice was done to it by the chef. I would like to revisit again but may be for a pickup this time."}
{"text":"This is the best lamb shank I've had in 20 years, thanks Mo!"}
{"text":"Move over pita jungle! The Mediterranean grill is the best, authentic food with the best service. My girlfriend and I started coming here a couple of months ago and we can't get enough of it!  Humus, kabobs, and lentil soup is a must have. Support the mom and pop shops. These folks deserve it!  Bravo M Grill!"}
{"text":"My sister loves this place so I decided to give it a shot. I try to eat as healthy as possible and judging by the menu everything looked very healthy. I ordered a mediterannean salad with chicken and lentil soup. Food was excellent other than the 25 min wait I had. But they are new and had 3 take out orders ahead. Guess could be deceiving cuz the dining room was empty. Ill return but hopefully not when the kitchens backed up."}
{"text":"Delicious food that the whole family enjoyed.  We ordered the mixed grill platter, fried eggplant and hummus and practically licked our plates clean. Meat was tender and flavorful.  Service was amazing, staff friendly and accommodating.  We're so glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"The food was over priced for what we received, and the service was poor to average. We know they were busy that night, but it's not an excuse for the service that night. My wife and I forgot our to-go container, and when we returned 10 minutes later the server had already thrown it in the trash. Overall, a bad experience and we recommend avoiding this place."}
{"text":"Small? Yes. Parking? Sucky. But Awesome!!!! I worked in a comic book store for 10 years next to this place and my pores sweat their great menu. Upon entering the location you will notice that it reminds you of a dentist office. Weird but true. 

On a weekday you will be hard pressed to not find an open table. Fridays through Sunday, good luck. It is an intimate space that allows you to keep your swearing to a minimum (there may be a kid right behind you, and I mean RIGHT BEHIND YOU). 

The food is your basic \"kabob-style\" menu. But this is not fast food. Lamb and steak cooked precisely to your request, veggie apps. like baba and tabouli are as fresh as it gets. Rice is delicious!  Also beware of their salad dessing...you will become addicted too it!

Small, but diverse menu. Very good service. Great to take out and eat at home. 

...They now have a corking fee, but who cares? Bring you biggest bottle(s) of wine and indulge, after all it is BYOB!"}
{"text":"Overall a good lunch experience.  Reasonably priced.  My lunch combo had a lot of meat and enough food for two meals."}
{"text":"Being from the middle east, my standards are pretty high when it comes to Middle Eastern food. But I was very pleasantly surprised when I recently stopped by this restaurant and had what I believe was the absolute best, most authentic middle eastern food in Pittsburgh!! I came here with a big group of friends and sampled a lot of the dishes on the menu including the mezza platter with the hummus, tabbouleh, falafel, grape leaves, baba ghanouj, and tried different main dishes including the chicken and lamb kabobs, kufta, kibbe neyye, shawarma, and fatoush. Every single thing I tasted was incredibly delicious. I rarely say this about any restaurant, but the food here really did remind me of home. And the service went over and beyond with making sure we were well served. What a pleasant experience!! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for tasty, authentic lebanese food and I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Don't miss this little gem tucked away inside a strip mall just off the 101 and Frank Lloyd Wright off Northsight. Excellent food.  Good menu variety.  Excellent service.  Great prices and portion sizes are just right."}
{"text":"This is one of those special places that more than deserving of five +++ stars. My oldest step son and I ate lunch there today, we shared the mixed grill and hummus, and we throughly enjoyed every bite! The food was wonderfully seasoned, cooked PERFECTLY! The rice had the perfect flavor and texture, the meat was well marinted and cooked better than perfect, tender and juicy! The hummus was smooth and creamy and so rich. I can't wait to try the red pepper and jalapeno flavor. I also can't wait for rice pudding there :). They take a lot of pride in what they are doing there!! It shows in the food! I hope the hard to find location doesn't make it difficult for them to stay open."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for Mediterranean food that might rival my Aunt's, and this restaurant is the closest I've come to home. The spinach lentil soup, in particular, is fantastic. If I were blindfolded and challenged to a taste test, it would be tough for me to distinguish the Mediterranean Grill's soup from the home-cooked treat I'm so often craving. The lemony, moist grape leaves are another close contender. The grape leave appetizer, served with pita, is quite filling for lunch.

Sadly, one of my favorite items, the salmon wrap, has been removed from the menu. I'm not sure why they thought this was a good idea, because it means I'm not visiting as often..

A few things to be aware of:

The restaurant isn't well marked, and it's easy to miss. I sometimes walk past it even though I've been there several times. Maybe I'm just spatially challenged though. 

The food might taste like home, but the restaurant certainly doesn't look like my family's dining room. Tucked away in the basement, the interior is pretty drab and uninspiring. I suppose if you like speakeasies or sterile rooms with wall-length mirrors, you might feel right at home.

If you like to eat lunch before noon, you'll have to wait outside. On weekdays it doesn't open until 12 on the dot."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night, after we had already had appetizers in the Squirrel Hill night market. Would definitely not come back! 

First of all, the tables were not clean and it was sticky. The ambiance was a let down, felt the place was so dull. Coming to the food, we were surprised to see the dinner portions so pricey. It was about 18-22$. The waitress did tell us, that 2 people can share one plate and we did that. We ordered the shish tawouk which are marinated chicken breast on a rice pilaf. The \"hot sauce\" they gave on the side tasted like straight up marinara sauce. When we asked for some other hot sauce, they didn't have any and gave us regular bottled hot sauce. The chicken was grilled well, but wasn't flavorful. 

Finally the check was handed to us when we were through 75% of the meal. We usually like to get a dessert in a Mediterranean place, and felt we were being rushed out. I agree with fellow yelper Jane regarding this point. There are tons of good Mediterranean options in the area and I don't see what better this place has to offer."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Middle Eastern food prepared like you were in someone's home. The owner is eager to please and very accommodating. There are a few vegan options, so I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"We visit this place often, in fact my bridal shower was here!  This past visit though was MUCH different!  To begin, for reasons not disclosed to us, this restaurant was CASH ONLY this visit.  Service was as usual except that the waitress seemed frustrated and ill-tempered.  Upon the completion of our dinner, a small boy, no more than 8 years old (probably a family member) was cleaning off the table.  Not only did he spill a water all over the table (luckily no ones phone was there) but he dropped a KNIFE, while attempting to carry a dish over my head!!  It is unfortunate to see this place in this way considering their food is so delicious.  seems to be headed more toward a take out spot."}
{"text":"I've lived in squirrel hill for two years and yet didn't know about this place until recently.  if you go, its in one of the stores between coffee tree roasters and the PNC bank, but the restaurant itself is in the basement so all you see in a small sign. 

i had the gyro platter, which to be honest wasn't great.  the three other people with me really liked their dishes though, so maybe I just picked a bad menu choice.  The hummus was fine as an appetizer, but nothing great.  

I would probably rank this below aladdin's, which is just down the street closer to shady.  

BYOB, corking fee is $2 (i think)"}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favorite restaurant.  I don't even live in Pittsburgh anymore.  When I come to town or friends come from there to visit, I must get food from The Med.  The staff is super nice and understands my food allergies.    
I used to come here at least weekly for fresh, healthy food."}
{"text":"I've had better. In fact, right down the street at Aladdin's on Forbes (and in Chicago, and in Mt. Lebanon). The menu is very limited, the place is tiny so it is crowded on a Saturday night (and there was a 15 minute wait), it was a little too warm, and the service sucked even after the crowd thinned out as the evening wore on. I had a kabob pita ($6.95) and my dining mate had Tabbouleh. The lamb tasted good and it was cooked just right, but the onions and peppers inside the pita were way overcooked. They were flavorless and slimy.
The main entrees on the menu seemed overpriced with price tags upwards of $18-20.
On the bright side, the interior had a nice color with some ornaments on the walls and there was some nice Mediterranean music playing.

But since I like Aladdin's better, I will probably not return.

{"text":"I want you all to listen closely. I'm Lebanese and have had the privilege of growing up around simply the best Mediterranean chefs around the world, traveled to Lebanon and Syria ate at the top mediterranean restaurants in Dearborn, mi (some of the best in the states), and without a doubt this is the most mouth watering cuisine I've ever had, let alone Mediterranean. The hummus is simply the best I've ever had. The tenderloin kabobs are so flavorful and succulent. The grape leaves, koosa, steak frys and tabbouleh are all as delicious and authentic as it gets. It's so difficult to find decent Lebanese here in Phoenix (people think pita jungle is good Lebanese lol), let alone a place I can call my new favorite restaurant. If you want the best Mediterranean/Lebanese you've ever had, stop looking, you just found it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food. Virtually everything is homemade, and made with care. It shows. The fatoush was bursting with flavor and was plenty large enough for a satisfying meal. The hummus and Baba ganoush were creamy, smokey and delightful. The soups are tasty. And the outside seating is perfect for a beautiful afternoon. Can't wait to get back for more!"}
{"text":"By far the best & most authentic Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh! Family owned & run! The new location is amazing, great ambiance & the food has stayed the same!
Best restaurant in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"Mediterranean Grill  has good food.  I like the sleek, falllafel, and fatoush, they have good cheap sandwiches too.  The lamb plate is a little pricey.  This place is BYOB - can have spotty service and the decor is 10 years past a remodel.  Be aware this place should be called Subterranean- Mediaterranen because it has no windows."}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean food i was able to find in Pittsburgh. It's miles better than any of the others, but hard to find hidden in a basement on Forbes ave in Squirrel Hill.

The place is family-run, so most evenings there's a collection of school-age youths in the corner doing homework. 

As a vegetarian, i can't comment on the quality of any of the meat dishes, but the veggie stuff is fantastic. I usually just ordered the mezza, with dolmas or falafel depending on my mood. The hummus alone is fantastic, but add in olives, feta, and the other classic Mediterranean goodies, and it's just divine.

The mezza was usually more than enough for two people to share, and if we added another appetizer there were always leftovers.

The service could be a little slow at times, but the food more than made up for it. 

Mediterranean Grill could never compete with a place like La Med in Berkeley, CA, but for the culinary wasteland that is Pittsburgh, it was an absolute gem."}
{"text":"Great food. Wonderful and friendly staff. This hidden gem will be a frequented stop for me. 

My boyfriend and I tired the jalapeño  humus, it was cream and served with a warm pita. We also split the mixed plate  and the falafel.  The mixed plate included 3 kinds if meat, rice and grilled veggies. It was very savory. the falafel was delightful as well. Everything was do filling I couldn't eat desert so we got the baklava to go. The baklava was delicious! Big fan of this place!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down this foodies favorite place to eat.  I travel often for work and for as many of times I make attempts to try other Mediterranean restaurants I am always disappointed and return back to Pittsburgh and crave the flavors from here.  It's always a treat and love being able to support locally owned small businesses.

My favs are Mousaka (with ground meat, potatoes, onions, and zucchini) , Schwarma (shredded lamb, wrapped in Pita with tahini), grilled chicken, rice, green beans with tomato sauce ...those are just to name a few. .. The rice pudding and baklava to wrap things up.

If your ever in the Shadyside area or are able to make the trip a definite must!!! I travel 30-40 minutes at least once every couple weeks to get my fix!"}
{"text":"Really amazing food! I have been looking for a great Mediterranean place, and really stumbled upon this place by chance! Super super delicious! Also, family run by the nicest people!"}
{"text":"BYOB.

The food here is really quite good but not as good or cheap as it used to be.  This place used to be really low priced for how good it was.  Apparently management has caught on.  There can be pretty long waits if its crowded and the place is pretty small.

I do enjoy the food here though and recommend the hummus and grape leaves."}
{"text":"My wife and I were pleasantly rewarded when we decided to try this friendly spot.  If you live in Scottsdale and like Mediterranean food this is definitely worth a visit.  It is family owned and everything is made fresh. My wife had lentil soup.  It was very hot the way soup should be, with the right blend of spices.  My falafel were some of the best I have had in the Valley.  I got the combo which included a drink and fries.  The fries were fresh cut not frozen.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is quality,  I've been here twice and so far the only thing better than the service is the food.  The grilled meat is especially good.  When it comes to Mediterranean Cuisine I'm very picky. The chicken kabob is full flavored and juicy as is the kefta and tenderloin. I highly recommend trying the mixed grill and get tenderloin since the kefta is already a mixture of beef and lamb.  If you like meat on a stick you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best place for authentic Lebanese/Middle Eastern cuisine in the 'Burgh and that is a fact! 

I cannot get enough of this place. Everything is spectacular! I brought a Saudi Arabian friend of mine, who has actually been to some of the best restaurants in Beirut, Lebanon. He told me, \"This food tastes just like it does in Lebanon!!!\" With that being said, I'm certain you'll be pleased. 

My favorite thing to order is the Kibbeh Nayyeh, which is only served on specific days of the week, Saturdays I believe. It's just delicious. I also dream about the lentil dish in my sleep. I highly suggest either one!

What makes this place special, aside from the fantastic food of course, is that it is family owned and operated, and always has been. A wonderful Lebanese family runs the place, which gives the restaurant a loving & comforting feel, which I swear can even be tasted in every bite. Wallah! 

The mother of the family and her son are the chef/cook, and they put their hearts into everything they make. The daughters are the servers, and I have to admit that they are VERY easy on the eyes and incredibly sweet. They made sure to kindly break-down & explain the menu to my ignorant American self. 

The only negative aspect of the place (struggling to find one) is that the restaurant's location isn't the best. It's sort of in a basement and not so easy to find. However, they told me they're moving to a storefront soon, and I'm very excited for the family and for their customers. I can't wait to try the new place! 

But . . . Hey! Let's be honest. As long as the food continues to be delicious, I couldn't care less if they decided serve it out of a truck in the Hill District. I'd go! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So this place was very cool! I came here for lunch with a co-worker and I was very impressed with both the service and the food. Our server was one of the owners I think, or maybe his Mom owns it? Either way when we ordered the tabbouli (fantastic), he said that his Mom makes it fresh everyday. WHAT!?! I've got a little old Lebanese woman making my tabbouli in the back? Sweet! You know that has to be good. And, we commented on how good it smelled and he brought over the incense that was burning and gave us a package for free. Impressive! The place could use a little decor to make it feel more Middle Eastern, but that's about it. It is kind of tucked away so I hope that doesn't prevent it from getting enough foot traffic."}
{"text":"This place was great!!! I had the chicken sharma and it was amazing! It was tender and had a great flavor. My wife had the fatoosh salad, which was fresh, a generous portion, and was extremely tasty. My son had the shish kafta and it was great tasting and was extremely fresh and tasted homemade ( which made it better ) . We will definetely be going back, and we suggest that you try it!! Best in town!!"}
{"text":"EAT HERE. I'm serious. The food is fantastic! It's a little hidden gem by the Scottsdale Gun Club. Family owned and everything is fresh and made to order. Have been there 3 times and haven't found anything to dislike. Their hummus is creamy with just the right amount of seasoning. Chicken schwarma is cut into bite-sized pieces and served with either hummus or garlic spread. OMG the garlic spread is amazing - looks like white butter and tastes like a tangy bite of heaven. Tawook is chicken breast pounded thin and cooked on the grill, also served with garlic sauce. Loved the spicy kafta in pita, served quesadilla style (no cheese, just meat between pita) with lots of hummus. The rice is flavorful and fluffy. Grape leaves stuffed with rice and meat were skinny little guys but packed with flavor; 6 on a plate was a good app for 2 people. But my very favorite thing is their salad. I don't know what they do to make lettuce, tomato and cucumber so good, but that magic seasoning and light touch of dressing is wonderful. They do not serve alcohol but you can BYO wine (beer too perhaps?) Very reasonably priced and generous portions.

Much busier at lunch but we love stopping in for dinner. They are not halal-sanctioned but they do get some halal meats (lamb yes, chicken no). Staff is super friendly and warm. Oh and they deliver!"}
{"text":"When I think about the Mediterranean Grill the first thing that comes to mind is the amaze-balls dressing. It is probably my favorite of all time, and that's coming from a Pittsburgh Ranch girl. I swear the first time I had it, it was MIND BLOWN. And the second thing that comes to mind in the MEAT! The chicken, the fillet mignon, even the gyro is delicious. My favorite meal to get is the salad with chicken or gyro. It has that fresh, lemony, minty dressing and the feta they put on it is like none I've ever had. I HATE feta, but I love their feta. It's nothing like what comes on your pizza from the local pizza place. This is kinda grated and so, so creamy. It really is unlike anything I've ever had. Usually the BF orders one of the entrees and I steal some of his rice pilaf and add that to my salad. It's like the Mediterranean version of a Chipotle bowl.  I'm not generally a huge fan of their specialties like the kibee or malfoof or grape leaves, but that's no reflection on them, just my child's palate. Because everything is always so fresh an delicious I make myself try everything offered to me (still kinda thankful no one has ordered the kibbe yet). I have tried the grape leaves and they are actually pretty good 
It seems to be a family owned place and the place has pictures of the mom and the daughters all over which I find charming. The first time we went I noticed the waitress looked like one of the girls in the photos.  The BF and I were whispering back and forth, when she picked up on it and explained it was her and her sisters. Family or not, the staff have always been great and we have a great time there. They do close earlier than most restaurants, I think around 9 on Saturdays, so keep that in mind. But, one of things I like most, the place is quaint and quiet and great for date night!"}
{"text":"I like this place. When I go I almost always order the mixed grill (chicken and lamb kebab) with rice! and a side of plain yogurt. I haven't really tried any other dishes so I can't comment on those.

The service is consistently good. The prices are definitely reasonable.

It's probably up to par with Aladdin's (also in sq. hill) and Ali's (s.craig st.) 
but for some reason, i prefer mediterranean grill."}
{"text":"Came here to figure out where I stood in the Mediterranean Grill v. Aladdin's debate.  Conclusion?  I'm still sitting on the fence, but I'm okay with that.  I like them both.

I ordered the falafel pita wrap here, which I've also eaten at Aladdin's.  The falafel at Mediterranean Grill is good--crunchy on outside, but not dry on the inside.  I'd say it's crunchier here than at Aladdin's.  Two things I prefer about Aladdin's falafel wrap are: the toasted pita and it seemed better wrapped (the Mediterranean Grill one fell apart sooner in my hands).  But, still, all in all, the falafel at Mediterranean Grill is good.  The wrap comes with the usual lettuce, tomato and tahini--nothing out of the ordinary, like the pickled vegetables that Aladdin's adds (which I very much like), but I was plenty satisfied.

The food and beverage selection is smaller than Aladdin's, but it's a smaller establishment, so I wouldn't hold it against them.  (In response to an earlier review: they don't have a hot mint tea, but their iced tea is mint).  The ambiance is weird here, but there's also something cool about trundling down those stairs to the basement and feeling like you know about a hidden gem."}
{"text":"On this visit to Scottsdale from San Diego we checked on yelp. This place had a good ratings so we went in. It was GREAT!! Had the humus: real good. Lentil soup real good. The  gyro was fantastic and the fries awesome. The steak from the kabob was cooked just right.. The staff was very friendly and great service."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC LEBANESE-STYLE MIDDLE-EASTERN FOOD. I guess being in the desert has got me craving Middle-Eastern all the time. For Lebanese-style, this place hits all registers. The manager, Mohammed, is incredibly nice and made sure my meal was PERFECTO! 

You folks in North Scottsdale, this is the best around for many miles!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Mediterranean food in town. Without a shade of doubt. This is a Lebanese family owned business that takes incredible pride in the quality and authenticity of the food. This is the real deal folks. 

Located in a nondescript strip center next door to a smoke shop and down the way from the Scottsdale Gun Club, you would never guess that this little gem of a new restaurant is serving up such authentic and tasty delicacies.

The menu is HUGE with a large selection of VERY fresh salads all made and cut by hand to order. Mom is in the kitchen here fellow foodies, and let me say that mom is a hell of a cook!  This is a family business and son Mo is outgoing and happy to point out recommendations from the menu. 

This is NOT your typical strip shopping center Gyro joint. Not by a long shot!

Nothing fancy inside - fine with me as long as the food is good right? 

The true test of any place like this to me is the Baba and the Hummus, and you will not be disappointed here by the smokey and smooth Babaganoush that is served with a few slices of beets - and simply delicious. The pita are quite good, although I do wish that they would grill them a little rather then serving at room temp - a small gripe but I'm sure they can do it that way if you ask. 

The hummus is also super smooth and perfectly balanced without being too heavy - just the right texture and taste. 

I have tried the Shish Kafta - a staple in the Middle east with ground beef, onions spices and parsley grilled. Marvelous. 

The salads are also exceptional!

My faves so far are the Fatoosh and the Lebanese salads - very finely diced, red & ripe tomatoes, a little mint, hints of lemon ...excellent dressings - all made to order!  

My daughter ordered the Falafel sandwich and it was superb - not oily, not too dry...just right on the money with a wonderful flavor that reminded me of the street Falafel stands in Israel that are so good. 

They don't have their beer/wine license yet but apparently it is in the works in coming months. 

I give this place my highest recommendation - they have a big menu of specialties, meats, kabobs and some appetizers that will simply delight your taste buds and your tummy (+don't miss the new happy hour - appetizers 50% off from 2-5PM!) .

Winner."}
{"text":"I loved this place, if you like dolma (grape leaves) and like lemons then this place has the best dolma ever! I have tried grape leaves at just about every mediterranean place I have ever been to, and these are by far my favorite. As to the rest of the food I am not sure I remember, because it was all secondary to the real reason I was there! The best grape leaves!

The flavors here are very good, and distinct. Some of my friends preferred Aladdins down the way but I was never impressed there... (The food seemed bland).

If you are going for ambiance, definitely pass on this place, it is a random office looking space in the basement of a non descript building, as someone else said it really looks like you are going to a dentists office...

p.s. try the grape leaves!"}
{"text":"The Mediteranean Grill is an unassuming little restaurant that serves delightful fare.  found the menu by complete accident as it was posted by the entrance of my gym.

The interior is not all that warm and welcoming and neither is the staff...but don't let that fool you because the food is surprisingly tasty. I ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich and a small side of babaganoush and they were both just incredible.

The only reason I am dinging one star is I thought the staff was kind of cold and just not very friendly and welcoming...I even heard one employee mentioning to his colleague that he couldn't wait for restaurant to close..Wow guys really ?...Chill out a  little and work out your differences because I really like your food and I would be very disappointed if you closed...All I ask is that you are a little friendlier with your customers. This was also my first visit. I must say that you really wowed me with the quality of your food...really...it was crazy delicious...In fact I just had an orgasm..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I'm Arab, and my mom cooks AMAZING food. This place is, hands down, the best authentic Lebanese food I've had in this country. The quality, the service, the flavor; everything was wonderful. My boyfriend and I ordered the mixed grill so we could a taste for all the meats they have, and we were more than satisfied. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to eat non-Americanized Mediterranean. The hummus is great, the coffee is delightful, and their baklava is a must try. If I could give this place ten stars I would. Gotta go check it out!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Delicious food, good portions, great service, and the owner is hot. I'd call that a win. Looks like we've found our new lunch spot;"}
{"text":"The Med. Grill has really good food! We ordered the baba and it was a good choice. The place itself is located in what seems to be a doctor's office, which throws you at first. It's a very basic family set up but I like something about that; no frills just really good quality family-style Mediterranean food! For an entree I got the fatoush salad with gyro. I really do wish it came with chunks of gyro instead of strips, as they were a tad dry. Other than that, it was an excellent experience...service included!"}
{"text":"I had grape leaves wrapped around rice for an appetizer. Not sure what it's called, but it was pretty tasty. I had falafel in a pita for dinner. It was good, but the dressing was a little rich. The rest of the pita was good, so I would recommend the dressing on the side. This place was extremely reasonable in price and the staff was favorable. Solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Son took my order while his mother was cooking in the kitchen - yes, an authentic family restaurant.  Cauliflower appetizer was extremely rich and lemony, hummus quite good too.  Service was good and parking was easy.  

Only issues I had was that the falafel is four croquettes for $7 which is insane (normally find them for 2 for a $1)!!!  Hummus price was up there too.  I think they either have a pricing issue or an identity issue - make yourself a fancy full service place and keep the prices, or acknowledge it's rather fast food with a waiter and price things more reasonably."}
{"text":"Went last night for carryout, hummus was some of the best (best in AZ by far), fatoosh salad very tasty & chicken shwarma also quite good.  Will return!!!"}
