{"text":"This is our new favorite place for drinks! The cocktails were expertly prepared and served in the correct glass. We started with the Snack Plate which is a selection of cured meats, cheese, dried fruits and nuts. It was very good!! We each ordered two drinks, an Old Fashioned, a 5th St. Finisher, a Cape Breeze and a La Diabla. Wow is all I can say. They were excellent. We then ordered a La Angelina Pizza. It was a flatbread type pizza big enough for two or three with maybe a little leftover. Also excellent. I recommend arriving before 7 pm to avoid the after work rush as the place isn't very big. We will most certainly be going back!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to get a carefully crafted cocktail after work. Strong drinks that can be sipped and enjoyed. Been here three times since they opened and a great experience every time."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great food, and great conversation. That is all you need to make a place a great place and this place has it. They have passion that they put into everything that they do. They believe that drinks need to be simple and just have great ingredients. I am excited to go back to this bar to enjoy more of their great cocktails."}
{"text":"First proper cocktail lounge Lorain County has to offer.  SOTDC has me mesmerized.  Maybe it's because I've matured a bit but lounges & bars like this are more appealing to me.  The tones are dark with a touch of dim lighting.  Not a bad seat in the place.  I loved the crowd everyone was happy.  Job well done behind the bar.  
 
Intimate hideaway for those enthusiasts seeking inventive & sociable drinking"}
