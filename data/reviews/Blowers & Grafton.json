{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place  !East coast donairs, garlic fingers that taste like heaven and deep fried bar clams! No joke, not just piss clams- the big juicy bar clams. It's such a relaxing environment with friendly and knowledgeable staff members,-chances are if you're from the East coast you have friends in common!  Great atmosphere, great ambiance, addictive food, great staff and the patrons are just as friendly. No need to be lonely or hungry with Blowers & Grafton around!"}
{"text":"I went here for other a group of girls and everything we ordered was top notch. The cheesy garlic bread--amazing! My friends had the donair and I had the fish and chips. Huge portions and very friendly service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm glad held off trying Blowers & Grafton until I had gone to Halifax, because I was able to have a true & fair comparison on how \"authentic\" it would be.  Even on a really cold and snowy midweek evening, this place was packed and there were take out/delivery orders going out non stop. I took this as a sign that it must be good!  Deciding that we had to go with the Halifax late night staple, I ordered the garlic fingers and torn between getting actual donairs or donair pizza, our server suggested the latter. Since we sat right in the middle of the banquet table, we saw food coming and going. So when the heaping pile of donair nachos were placed in front of our neighboring tablemates, we questioned if doubling on on essentially two pizzas was gonna be our downfall. Luckily, our server changed our order as we munched on our garlic fingers.  I've been told time and time again that the savoury garlic sauce we've all grown to love in Calgary is not \"real donair sauce\", so I'm glad we got the sweet sauce with our garlic fingers. What is there not to love about garlic fingers? Cheesy, garlicky gooiness on a pizza crust Mmmmm  The donair nachos were awesome. It was as if a donair wrap exploded on a bed of house made chips, I'm so glad we made the switch.  That being said, the next time I'm back, I'll have to try the donair pizza and the fried pepperoni!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. My first visit was stellar. We tried the lobster rolls with potato chips and the donut. The lobster rolls were excellent. They definitely met my expectations for what a lobster roll should be. The lobster was fresh, meaty and wasn't drowning in mayo. The bun was soft and buttery. Quite excellent and I'd definitely recommend. The potato chips were crispy and quite tasty although they could be a tad more salty. The donut was great although a tad pricey for a timbit sized donut. The Saskatoon berry sauce and dulce de leche were not over top or too sweet.   On my second visit, we tried the donair pizza, chicken alfredo pizza, clam and chips and donuts. I had quite high expectations for the donair pizza given how good it's supposed to be however it fell short of my expectations. The crust was very hard and the texture was not right in my opinion. The donair sauce was also too sweet and not creamy enough. There were also too many onions for my liking. The chicken alfredo was better than the donair pizza although a tad dry. I didn't see much alfredo sauce. The clam and chips were definitely tasty but the clams were a bit tough. The fries were crispy and good. The donuts were just as good as the first time I had them.   Service was average on both visits. And they don't seem to be too busy given the small space. The fish and chips looked really good and I may give that a try next time."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple weeks after they opened and had a less than stellar experience. There was a bit of a portion control issue in the kitchen with some of our food and the waitress who served us was pretty saucy and didn't really know much in terms of basic serving etiquette. It was really stuffy with so many people crammed into the tiny space but apparently their HVAC was just having issues which seem to be since resolved.  Went back to try them again this week and looks like they were just growing pains from the opening because they have improved and fast after I gave them feedback which is definitely a sign of great management. The idea of a restaurant that could take me back to the East Coast anytime I wanted was the main reason I tried this place out to begin with and they do it well! The first time I went the highlights were the caesar and po'boy - this time around everything we ordered was a 5/5. The Hali pizza, lobster roll (do not skip this - you'll regret it) and of course the caesar. The waitress who served us the first time wasn't around and the rest of the staff were extremely friendly, it was really an authentic East Coast experience and I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Delish donair pizza!! Lots of meat... maybe just need a little more sauce!!  Used the delivery service and worked out great!!"}
{"text":"TLDR - It's as good as you can get for Halifax street food in Calgary.   Service -Slower, but not holding it against them as shit happens. Clean and overall pleasant.   Food - We had garlic fingers and clams and chips. The clams were a bit overdone but had a light batter. The g-fingers were a HUGE hit. They nailed the donair sauce!   Price - Quite affordable and good value for the $.   Would definitely come back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and always so delicious! First time I had the lobster roll and they were to die for! The bun was super soft and made invhousr. I totally recommend it! The second time we came here with friends and I tried the Donair and it was amazing and super filking. Come here and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"OMG absolutely amazing!!  Just like being home!  Probably the best fish and chips we've ever had!!  Oh and the garlic cheese fingers!!  So much cheese!  We also had the donair nachos and fried pepperoni.  Keep up the good work and don't change a thing!!"}
{"text":"Great cozy atmosphere, small in comparison to other restaurants. Seats maybe 30 at best. For the best east coast comfort food, this is the place. Pretty good selection of beer on tap and bottle: Forget about trying to get a seat Thursday or Friday night after 5, it's packed."}
{"text":"What a treat, I usually have to wait 2 years for our trip back to Halifax to get my fill. And at risk of creating line ups to get in I will say adding the peperonni to the donair makes it a double dose of delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I scoped this place out last week. What a great little spot. Cozy with a comfortable atmosphere. She had an amazing Halifax inspired Donair that was awesome with a spicy pepperoni that kicked it up a notch and I had some of the meatiest Beer batterd fish & chips I've ever had with no doubt the best homemade tartar sause on Earth. The prices were fair and the server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Wow !  What an awesome restaurant!  From the classy and subtle Nova Scotia decor to the incredible food the owners ( including Josh, a friendly Nova Scotia man who stopped by and chatted) every detail has been well thought out.  The lobster is flown in direct from Nova Scotia for the lobster roll and the donair recipe has been perfected.  It was well worth the long wait on a Friday evening!"}
{"text":"We have been here quite a few times and have always had a good experience.  The donairs (and the donair pizza and nachos) are absolutely delicious and the portion sizes are very large. Price-wise you get a lot of value for your money.   The service is what really shines at Blowers and Grafton. All of the waitresses that we've had have been friendly and do their jobs well. At our last visit, a new kitchen staff was being trained and our food was really delayed. Our server handled the situation really well and did everything she could to make the visit as enjoyable as possible considering the circumstances.   Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"We love lobster rolls and Blowers & Grafton are the best that we have had outside of the East Coast.    Technically they aren't serving lobster rolls as they are little sandwiches, but the bread that was provided was as good or better than any roll that I have tasted. The lobster rolls were garlicy, buttery, lemony bites of fresh, succulent lobster heaven! A standard order is 3 small \"rolls\" on a bed of fresh, homemade potato chips, but they allow you to purchase another roll for $6 to even up the number. A couple of those little guys are surprisingly rich and filling.  If you manage to pop in before 5:30, they offer happy hour drink specials for under $4.   The restaurant was fairly busy but our server was efficient and friendly. Parking is street only which is kind of a pain in that part of Edmonton Trail but it is worth the time to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've never been to Halifax nor have I had an authentic donair or lobster roll before.  I went to Blowers & Grafton twice and tried a variety of items.  - Lobster rolls were a decent size with chunks of well seasoned lobster served on a bed of house made chips.   - Blueberry donuts were the size of a timbit (but much tastier) topped with blueberry compote. - Clams and fries (or choice of chips) were a good portion but clams were on the chewier side. - Donair pizza: did not enjoy this at all.  I don't like the hard, crispy crust nor did I like the odd tasting donair sauce.  It's sweet and taste more like a milk sauce... is that the way it's supposed to be? Good amount of toppings on it though. - Chicken bacon alfredo pizza: did not like the crust either but this pizza was better tasting than the donair for sure.  However was expecting pizza to be coated in a creamy sauce yet it was kind of dry.  Price point it's very fair and service was ok but friendly.  I would come back for the lobster roll for sure."}
{"text":"I finally checked this Halifax pub out! Unlike the other Yelpers that reviewed Blowers & Grafton, I've never been out east. I never tried a Halifax-style donair before and I've only eaten a lobster roll and clams and chips once in my life in Seattle.   Blowers & Grafton took over the old Carino location in Bridgeland. The room is small but modern and clean. Service was prompt and friendly. The food was reasonably priced and tasty. My husband ordered a Hoppy Buoy and I picked a pint of Alexander Keith.   The clams were VERY good. Nice meaty pieces with a good chew to it. The fries were crispy and I liked the homemade tartar sauce. The meat in the donair was plentiful. There was so much sauce that there was a big pool of it on the plate. The sauce was sweet. If you never had a Halifax donair, it's nothing like the ones I'm familiar with in Vancouver and Calgary.   I really enjoyed the blueberry grunt, which I accidentally called a gunt. It's like a really delicious mini doughnut but airy inside and worthy of being in Avenue Magazine as one of the sweetest deals in #yyc!   I plan to go back to try the lobster rolls, fish and chips, donair pizza and more gunts. I mean grunts. hehe"}
{"text":"I came in for a visit to this place the other weekend. The name of the restaurant reminds me of these two streets from where I grew up in Nova Scotia. I was amazed that this was a restaurant in the West that served great East Coast style food. It's amazing; I haven't had an actual donair since living on this side of Canada. This place nailed it! I couldn't have felt more at home than eating this food and having a Moosehead beer. The place was packed, super clean and incredible staff. 10/10 would come again."}
{"text":"Four of us went on a Friday night. The place itself is very small. Not too many tables and for big group, this place is not ideal. Place was not that busy but it took a while for them to get us a table which was not cleaned properly.  Luckily food did not that long time to come and server was friendly.  We ordered Lobster roll, mussells, chips . Lobster rolls were amazing. They looked good and tasted good too. I found mussells to have very strong smell. I think if I have to go again that would be only for lobster rolls."}
{"text":"Great donair, good service, being from Halifax it was great to get some comfort food I grew up on. Definitely would recommend to anybody and I hope they have wonderful success and become a Calgary staple for Maritimers."}
{"text":"After a month of being tempted by images and reviews of authentic Halifax-style donairs and garlic fingers on social media, I finally made my way to this new restaurant in Bridgeland.  Blowers and Grafton is a small, modern and tastefully decorated restaurant on Edmonton Trail. I went on a Sunday for an early lunch, shortly after the restaurant opened. Although me and my guest were the first to arrive, the restaurant was nearly half full by noon. On talking to the waitress, I was very happy to hear that much of the staff originated from Halifax and the restaurant either made their base ingredients in-house or had them shipped in from the east-coast.  Although the menu included several delicious sounding items including poutine and pizza, I had pre-decided that I needed a donair and garlic fingers: two items that are hard to find on this side of Canada. I'm from the Maritimes. I know what I'm looking for when it comes to these east-coast \"delicacies\". So, how does Blowers and Grafton stack up?  Donair: 9.5/10. The meat was perfectly seasoned with the slightest background hit of spice. The sauce was the perfect amount. Enough to flavour the whole donair without being excessive. The pita was soft and contained the heaping portion of meat well. By default, the donair comes with tomatoes and onions. Being a donair purist, I consider these the only appropriate toppings for a donair, so I was happy to see no mention of lettuce or other blasphemous toppings (although, cheese and pepperoni are optional add-ons). The only factor that knocked a half point off my rating is that I could have done with a touch more tomatoes and onions.  Donair sauce: 8.5/10. Yes, the donair sauce is important enough that it requires it's own assessment. Often times, places in Alberta make an attempt at the sacred sweet and garlic-y sauce calling it \"sweet sauce\". A good donair sauce is yellow tinged, sharp with garlic and is so thick it can stand up on its own. Here, the flavour was right but I found the sauce a bit runny.  Garlic fingers: 7/10. Although very good compared to what else is available in Calgary, I found myself slightly disappointed with the garlic fingers. The crust was crispy from a wood fired oven. Although this is a desirable trait in pizza, I prefer my garlic fingers with a \"pouffier\" crust. The stretchy cheese was generous, but I was missing some of the super garlic-y flavour that is key in a good garlic finger.  Overall, very good rating. It's so hard to find good Halifax-style dishes in Alberta, so I'm happy to have found a place that does it right."}
{"text":"I struggled to put a positive review up as I wanted to keep this little gem all to myself.  There were a lot of rave reviews on this place and the food especially the lobster rolls.  Do not have them!  They are so delicious in the buttery rolls and the lemon to cut the richness.  Save yourself and DO NOT eat them...there will be addiction issues.  Also the staff may suggest you have this dip they describe as life in a bowl.  DO NOT get that either for your chips.  The problem with this drip is that they do not serve it in an IV, trust me I asked.  The whole group loved everything they ate and we will be back as we now have to feed our addiction.  Thanks a lot Blowers & Grafton for being my new addiction.  The struggle is most definitely real."}
{"text":"Donair pizza, garlic fingers and meat skewers- thumbs up as a post golf meal for our hungry family.  We lived in Halifax for 2 years- long enough to enjoy haligonian eats.  Donair pizza- I worked at a place that ordered this pizza all the time- the version here was good, but not the same as what I ate in Halifax.  I remember donair pizzas having a much thicker and less crispy crust - but over my yelp reviews, I often state how I prefer thin crust pizza, so this actually suited my tastes today. Also, I remember a lot more donair meat on the pizza- they could be more generous with the meat here, but still they were obviously donair pizzas.  The garlic fingers did not disappoint.  My kids ate the meat skewers without sharing- that says something, right?  I would return to try the mussels that were not available tonight.  Lovely service and enjoyed being able to reminisce about our time in Halifax, with the Halifax photos all over the walls."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Fantastic, well priced food and wonderful customer service! Highly recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are maritimers, living in Calgary for the last 4 years, so when I got an email from Yelp about this newly opened place I SO badly wanted this place to be good. I stalked their instagram, drooled over the pictures, and couldn't wait to try it out. We got take out garlic fingers which were a pretty big let down. Not enough cheese, weird bacon that you could tell came from a bag. I want to give this place another chance but I'm not sure if my husband will go for it! Maybe I'll intice him with a donair and we can eat in instead. But based on our first experience I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"A place that sells lobster rolls, Be still my beating hart! So I thought.   I had a craving for lobster so bad the last couple weeks and stumbled across this restaurant that opened up in Calgary. Since my trip to San Francisco got canceled I figured I'll try this place to get my fix. Call up the girlfriends to join in and off we go.     It is a small space very crowded and loud I could not have a conversation with the person sitting across from me. I was worried the waitress would get my order wrong so I just pointed to what I wanted on the menu instead of telling the girl. Turn down the vibes so people can talk.   Ordered arrived glorious maybe my lobster would fix things. Nop! The rolls where good but not perfect, the dressing is a little too powerful and drowns the lobster taste out. The house beer that I ordered is just a Canadian with a different label.  All and all nothing to fuss over at this place."}
{"text":"I will have to say the owner did contact me to come in and retry the food which I think is awesome we had a day selected but could not make it in. So that being said I will retract my previous review the owner shows great pride in his business."}
{"text":"Oh my heart, I've been waiting to go here ever since it opened and I must say: the food did not disappoint. We ordered the lobster roll (worth every penny), and the fish and chips and were very impressed.   The only thing that lacked was service. Our server was actually the bartender, and in a full restaurant he was undeniably busy so it's by no means his fault, but service was slow and inattentive. We weren't in a rush but both kind of felt like we were just shoved in a corner and forgotten about."}
{"text":"Visited B&G for the first time over lunch and really enjoyed it. The waitress was super helpful and the food was great. We tried the Brothers Pepperoni and my first ever Halifax Donair. Everything was fantastic and I will be back to try some more menu options. I would recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"My husband & I tried this place out on a trip to Calgary and let me just say how excited I am for them to open shop in Edmonton.  The pub was a lot smaller than we had anticipated, and had a different vibe than we expected too. I loved that it was set up like a fancy pub where you could dress up to go. The place started filling up while we had a couple drinks & waited for our food. The atmosphere was eclectic & upbeat.  I started with a Maritime Mule which is a Moscow Mule made with tequila. I loved it!  We ordered Donair nachos & a poutine to share. The Donair nachos are like homemade crisps with Donair meat, sauce, tomatoes, & onions on it. I've never had anything like them and I am obsessed! I will try to make my own until next time I can go. I could go on about this dish forever. The serving size is massive & could definitely satisfy the hunger of 4 people on its own. The poutine was delicious! The homemade chips were perfectly cooked, topped with a generous amount of mozza and the most amazing gravy I have ever had in my life. Great to share if you are splitting other dishes as well. I would definitely order as my own lunch some time though as it is a good size & I wouldnt want to share the nastiness.  We ordered the garlic fingers & brothers pepperoni to go. The garlic fingers were delicious, but a little light on the cheese for my preference, when comparing to glace bay nova Scotia garlic fingers. Like a pizza, you can order different sizes. The smallest could be shared amongst 4 people with other appys or between 2 for a full meal. We asked for mild brothers pepperoni but were definitely given the spicy. I loved it but my husband couldn't eat it because it was so hot. They are served with a honey garlic type dip that just tops off the flavour profile. The serving size is definitely for sharing unless you eat low carb and are used to a large amount of meat at once.   This restaurant is worth the visit & we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Quaint atmosphere. I had the scallops & chips. Yum!  My friends had the seafood platter & Hali cheese steak.  The Caesar was practically an appetizer - came with donair meat on a skewer & more. Would highly recommend this spot for good, authentic east coast food. My only criticism would be the fries - not great, just okay. Our waitress was amazing! My friend ordered an after-dinner drink with whipped cream & cider. She did not care for the \"curdling\" effect so one of the owners gave her a gift card. Amazing! I rarely give 5* & would rate the food & service a solid 4.5* - only I could select the 1/2."}
{"text":"My friend and I are from Halifax so we had very high expectations and Blowers & Grafton lived up to them in every way! We started by sharing the garlic fingers with donor sauce and the brothers fried pepperoni (hot). The donair sauce was on point and the garlic fingers were deliciously cheesy. The pepperoni is exactly how you would get it in Halifax at places like Maxwell Plumb's and the hot variety had a spicy kick to it.   We then each went for the OG Halifax Donair and were and found it to be pretty close to a Halifax donair, more so than any other place I've been to in Calgary. The one difference I noted was that the donair meat was shaved a bit thicker than traditional Halifax style, but the taste and spice of the meat was very close to Halifax style.   Our server Jess was fantastic, greeting us as soon as we sat down, checking in frequently, and telling us a few stories of her own from her days in the Maritimes. She was very friendly, the food came out quickly and she was very knowledgeable of the cocktail menu as well.  5 stars all around and I'll definitely be back. Can't wait to try the routine next time!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant this Saturday and felt welcomed by the staff and the delightful design of pipes (I'm a pipe fitter so I enjoy these things lol). Sitting at the bar you have a wonderful view of the workshop-like kitchen where you can see the chefs working and the bar. The building itself looks really nice from outside and inside.   Their menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starters. I had the brothers pepperoni , while my friend tried the Donair nachos. They were awesome. The main course for us was the Donair and man it was bomb!  The service was amazing and really fast. Our waitreas was really nice and friendly. I would highly recommend anyone going to Blowers and Grafton whether your going on a date with that special someone or with your goof ball buddy like me lol."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an afternoon snack and was thrilled! I indulged in the poutine: home cut fries, topped with a savory delicious gravy and smooth and creamy cheese curds - heaven! My companion indulged in the OG Halifax donair and was instantly transported back to Halifax, he loved it. I had a glass of the house Cabernet and was pleasantly surprised, lovely full body drop that was not at all offensive. The service was fantastic and will be going back for more. :)"}
{"text":"This place was well put together in terms of design and atmosphere. It really feels cozy and friendly.  The staff was great and very friendly.   The menu has many options! I had no idea what traditional food from Halifax was about, turns out it is delicious items like Donairs, Garlic fingers, Lobster Rolls, pizzas etc.   I would definitely recommend this place for a visit! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Being from Halifax I had to go check this place out.  I have many memories of the beloved Pizza Corner in Halifax from those late night bar hopping shenanigans.   It's not a very big place but it's a nice size with large tables that you share.  The decor is great with lots of pictures of Halifax, Peggy's Cove, and Citadel Hill. We had the Brother's Fried Pepperoni to start and it was fantastic!!!  Took me back to home with each bite.  I had the clams and chips for my main and these are actual large full bar clams  seasoned and dredged just perfect before being fried.  The chips are nice home done and taste fantastic with malt vinegar.  The tartar sauce is housemate and has a wonderful flavor that pairs very well with the clams.  My husband has the fish tacos, made with Haddok and they where phenomenal with just the right seasoning.   To finish we both had the Oxford blueberry doughnut which was 100x better than any mini doughnut made at the Stampede.  I will plan on saving room to have more of those little gems on my next  visit.    I will and have recommended this place to my friends and family and I will be back as my next venture is to try and compare their donair to my back home hero King of Donair on the Dartmouth waterfront."}
{"text":"Wow, ok so I was wrong! Blowers & Grafton is an excellent restaurant.  Our waitress was wonderful, she was attentive to our needs and was pleasant to speak with. Since we had come on Father's Day she let us know that they were giving away fried pepperoni, we tried some and it was good! Each piece was perfectly fried (we ate most of it before I took a photo)   This time around we ordered the fisherman's platter, and everything was delicious. I loved the clams, they were tender tasty morsels, but the star of the platter was that beer battered haddock. The batter was so light and crisp, and the fish cooked to perfection, nothing on this platter lacked seasoning or flavour. We also got the fish tacos - very delicious. My boyfriend even said these were the best fish tacos he's ever had in Calgary, and I have to agree with him. The fish tacos were fantastic and the best I've had in Calgary as well. To end the dinner we got some of the blueberry donuts. I really liked the donuts they reminded me of the mini donuts from stampede but better.   Honestly I'm glad I returned to the place because the food was impressive and delicious. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Went to the official first day opening of Blowers and Grafton and I am so happy to announce that the Bridgeland area has another awesome, trendy, unique place to spend your lunch and dinner hours!   My husband and I stopped by for a quick bite, and we were so impressed by the initial walk in. The decor is classic, minimal, and refreshing. We were greeted immediately by attentive staff, and the place was very lively!  I am a vegetarian, and they had some awesome options for me. Although they really pride themselves on authentic food from the maritimes, they had a few salads to choose from, some appetizers and they had pizza! I wasn't too hungry, so I did what most people frown upon and ordered myself a Greek salad. It was delicious and HUGE! For 6 dollars I was stuffed! So many fresh kalamata olives, crumbled feta, tons of cucumber, tomato, onion, pepper + the dressing was fresh and perfect.   My husband was recommended the Wagyu beef steak sandwich (I believe it was called) and he said it was to die for! He's got a pretty big appetite but the sandwich had him stuffed! He was also very impressed with the fact that they used such a high quality beef! He tried their signature Blowers and Grafton lager (too cool), which he also thoroughly enjoyed.    All in all, we had a lovely time. Happy to see yet another awesome restaurant / pub open up in the Bridgeland area.   Keep up the good work, guys!"}
{"text":"This is a must-eat-and-feel place in Calgary. The ambiance is unique and it has a very soothing feel to it. It definitely sparked my inner traveller and I'm set on travelling to the east coast more than ever before.  You gotta try their clams and chips with tartar sauce. Mouth Watering! Also the staff are extra attentive which always helps with the overall experience."}
