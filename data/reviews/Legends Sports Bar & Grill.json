{"text":"We tried this place because of a restaurant gift certificate and we weren't disappointed. I tend to judge a bar by it's chicken wings, and they were really good here. The sauces were great (medium was the best) and the portions were generous. The husband loved the chicken tenders. The folks working there were super to us. This little bar also offers live music, karaoke, pool tables and darts. We will be going back without question."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Vegas. Loose slots and very friendly bartenders. They have live music and its very spacious inside with pool,darts, and games."}
{"text":"Legends was my go-to bar which I would frequent about once a week while I was living near by.    The best reason to go here so far has been the Thursday night Packer game.  They had a live DJ playing stadium-style chants without overdoing it and the crowd was more into it than any other bar crowd I've been part of.  As the game (New Orleans at Green Bay) neared and end and the Packers were sure to win, there were even girls dancing (cheer style) on a couple of tables near the DJ.  Surreal.  On normal weeknights, there is a fun pool crowd here.  It's not overly competitive so if you are a relatively new player, you'll be fine.  They also have volleyball which looks more fun than competitive.  They carry the fights, especially MMA.  Like on Packer games nights, it will be packed.  You may not find a seat if you are late.  Wings are crispy and well prepared.  In fact, all of the bar food I've ordered here has been great.  Drink prices are fair.    Service sometimes lags.  I suspect this is related to its hit-or-miss crowd sizes during the week.    They also have a live DJ with dancing on Thursday nights, typically."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink.  Rough crowd, was wondering if I was in Madison.  Stated grill was closed, then short while later saw bartender bring out basket of fries.  Lots of tvs and looked might day game would b ok.  Bouncer was on his phone texting and forgot to check anyone's ID.  Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Good food, Great bartender, and awesome selection of beer. Leinenkugel's Big Butt Doppelbock is awesome too."}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  I went in tonight to watch a preseason football game. Now for those that may not know, a preseason game doesn't count--which meant that the crowd was small. I sat down at a counter right in front of the biggest TV in the place--which also meant that I was very visible. No servers came by. After about ten minutes, I then walked up to the bar, where two ladies were. I made eye contact, but NEITHER OF THEM EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED ME, much less asked for my order. I then walked back to my spot, and watched the first half. NOT ONE TIME did any server ask for my order the ENTIRE TIME I was watching the game. INEXCUSABLE...I will never return.   And the ONLY reason I'm giving a 1 star rating is because I have to give at least one."}
{"text":"Went to Legends for Friday Fish with some friends.  We got there early, about 5:30 and the place was not very busy.  The sign said to seat yourself so we found a booth in the corner.  The wait staff came over quickly and got our drink order back to us without delay.  They have a nice choice of beers so I tried something different.  We all ordered fish some had the baked and some fried.   The food came out of the kitchen quite timely.  We were surprised to get a small ear of sweet corn on our plate.  The garlic mashed potatoes were very good.  The soup and coleslaw were also tasty.  A warm roll and good taste to the fish.  All in all a very good meal.  If you are looking for a place to get seated and served quickly with good food - then give this place a try."}
{"text":"Went to watch UFC with a friend. Wings were on special and were decent. Our waiter was completely inept and dropped half our food coming out of the kitchen.  Check seemed to be more then it should.  Waiter probably messed that up too. It gets packed after 10pm. Great people watching."}
{"text":"First impression: Rough atmosphere, rough crowd.  Short and sweet: The bartender was awful.  Never looked up from his cell phone once from the time we walked in, sat down, and five minutes later walked out....we even shouted at him.  Nothing good."}
{"text":"I absolutely Love this place. It is one of the most spectacular Sports bars on the west side. They have EVERYTHING here. Legends is kind of tucked away near the West Towne mall and the next most recognizable thing nearby is a Chucky Cheese. Straight away the only qualm I have with the place is the parking lot. Not enough parking what-so-ever. Not the end of the world though. You walk in through a corner entrance to reveal a huge wrap-around bar with TONS of tables and stools surrounding it.  There is a huge screen at the front along with dart boards to get you started on the Sports bar feel. Pool table in the opposing corner with a few slots as well. Now the kickers of this place. First the big screen at the front? That is mainly reserved for very large UFC fights!!!! YES one of very few bars in Madison will show them because of how costly they are to show. Can't get a great view of the screen? don't worry. They have probably over 15 other TV's surrounding the bar attached to the ceiling. I am not exaggerating one bit. You can't escape a TV in this place even if you wanted to. Which is awesome because they show pretty much every kind of sport known to man. The outdoor patio on the side if large and plentiful of seating where they still play the audio for games and yet you still have a clear view inside the window at current games.  Head around to the back of the bar and there is a full-size volley ball court! Leagues and all. The other immediate thing you will notice is the awesome new Tiki Shack bar they HAND BUILT with a large (around 50\") TV mounted against the wall. They don't stock a ton back there but another pitcher of mediocre beer? Sure! They have bean bag boards and sometimes some special events like $1 Cheese burgers and not too long ago they even had a full-size lamb cooking back there! IT WAS DELICIOUS. They also have live music back there sometimes with a little stage in the corner, no real big names or anything but more than what any other kind of place would have.  Most importantly, the employees and the family that owns this place is spectacular. They make you feel like a regular even if this is your first time there. If your a regular you feel like family. The owner of this place is always genuinely concerned with how you might be doing and how you are in his company and the establishment. If not my favorite #1 bar it is a very close second but I might be brave and say it is.  Most nights end up as \"Legends?\" \"Yep\""}
{"text":"Best bar I have come across. Its not much on the outside, but don't let that fool you. When you walk in, its like a whole new world. It's very clean and very open. They have a couple pool tables, classic video games, new dart boards, gaming machines on the bar and a stage for live music. They have Karaoke on Thursday nights, live bands on the weekends. The Staff is awesome!! They are great people and super friendly. This is the best spot I found that you can just chill and have fun. Drinks are very reasonable. Bucket of 5 beers for $8, they have some draft beers and great selection of mixed drinks. They had a great food place that closed. They did reopen it and run it themselves now. The menu is simple but very good. That is definitely getting better day by day. This is a must try place. You won't be disappointed. Till next time...Let's Eat!!"}
{"text":"Good service nice people close to our motel. Perfect. Plenty of beer selection. We walked from the American motel."}
{"text":"Never again will I ever step foot here ever again. If I could give this place a negative review, I absolutely would. First time going to Legends was to go watch a group of friends play Volleyball will also be my last time there. A single bouncer who watched the door hates his life, made negative comments towards everything out loud. Things were brought to the owners attention and he smirked and insisted for everyone to drink some more. Terrible first impression there, terrible service and as I said never stepping for here again."}
{"text":"Great bar. Live entertainment Saturday afternoons. Homemade food. The fresh breaded chicken fingers and fresh made bacon cream cheese stuffed jalapeños are the bomb!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the bars back home. I love the small town feel that I get here. Some darts, pool tables, jukebox with a wide variety of music, karaoke nights, very reasonably priced drinks, some gaming and a very friendly staff. Jusy abkut something for everyone. I have had a great time each time I've gone and I will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"It's okay.  They seem to have a lot of drink specials, and they had quite an extensive food special menu for the day I was there.  I wouldn't get the ribs next time, boiled meat with alot of barbecue sauce poured over the top.  Plenty of tv's, and the waitress said they couldn't make the Mojito I had order because they didn't have fresh mint for it, much to their credit.  Must be the place to take the kids on the weekend, because despite the Chuckie Cheese across the street, most had kids in tow."}
{"text":"Been here for two badger basketball games. Absolutely great atmosphere on game day but the food is average. I'll come here on game days but not for much else... No Heinz ketchup which is sad as Heinz ketchup is the king of condiments"}
{"text":"Legends Sports Bar & Grill is a nice local place to hang out and listen to live music. The freshly prepared food is really good too. Last Sunday I was at the 100th show celebration for the band Kold Kats, and I had a great time listening to the band and their friends who joined them onstage play some great live music. I look forward to going back on Sunday nights and hearing them play again."}
{"text":"Legends is a great new sports bar between Odana and Mineral Point on Grand Canyon Dr. I enjoyed that they serve Ale Asylum beer on tap. Also, this place has $.29 buffalo wings during big games and these wings are fantastic! I ordered them and expected something equivalent to Pizza Hut wings (Pizza Hut wings taste like they are boiled and then baked), but I was blown away with how well these wings are prepared -- Wow! The wings have a great buffalo sauce flavor with a perfect crispiness to the outer wing (I find a lot of restaurant wings are without the crispiness) -- these really are as good as they get and for the price, fantastic! Packed with TVs including a huge projection screen."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long time. I was amazed that it was still just as comfortable and affordable as ever. The live music is a bonus.  Check out the calendar of events to see what free entertainment is coming up next."}
{"text":"Best sports bar in Madison outside of Brats. Especially awesome for UFC and boxing -- it gets to be a full house on those events. Most of the food is pretty good and solid wing and shrimp specials during games."}
{"text":"This bar is my HOME! I always always always go here !!!! There's always something going on! It's never a stick in the mud! Jim the owner is just a fantastic person and Stephanie and Kathy are just wonderful sweet bar tenders! Everyone here is family! The environment is extremely comfortable and impeccably clean! Plenty of places to sit... two pool tables and dart boards at the very least!!! Then gambling of course!!! OH! How could I forget ROGER! Want some nachos or chicken fingers to die for??? YOU NEED TO GO TO LEGENDS!!!"}
{"text":"I need to be honest about this review; I wasn't quite the most sober of individuals when I visited here with my wife and some friends. We had just returned to the hotel down the road after The Great Taste of the Midwest. All of us were hungry; we didn't want to go far because, well, we just returned from The Great Taste of the Midwest. When we walked in, it wasn't too busy and we were seated right away. Our waiter was really nice and helpful.   We all placed our orders. Of course my wife and friends were difficult with theirs, \"Hold the onions, extra pickles, No ketchup, etc. They are a very demanding group) the only request I had was that I wanted my Black Jack Burger cooked medium. Again, I can't comment on the flavor of the food. Everything tastes much better than it really is when you have been drinking beer for 5 hours, the only thing I can honestly say as a negative was that when my burger arrived, it was well done. I didn't complain because I was hungry and didn't want to wait. I did provide feedback at the end of the meal.  Everyone else's order was correct... yea they had the difficult ones and it was right!   Overall we all seemed to like. We'd probably go back next year if we stay in the same hotel."}
{"text":"Great place and good people.  You won't be alone on game day, and jell-o shots may be present when WI teams score. They can reserve tables for you and your group for a good deal. I also believe there are food specials during some.  The reconstructed volleyball court is awesome, and it helps they have a spring-summer and summer-fall season, so if you can't do one, you can do the other. Servers will come to player tables for drink orders so you aren't constantly on and off the court & can have a fresh one when you jump off the court. Winter broom ball is a great option for a winter team sport that is not bowling.   The Tiki bar outback is a great addition to the outdoor patio.  An opportunity to hang out in the nice weather, watch sports on the tv, and scope out the volleyball scene.   Also have some good bands when scheduled and plenty of tvs inside, where they'll accommodate when possible to the game you're looking for. The other day they placed the Jets game for us on two tvs. Took a couple minutes, but they had no objection."}
{"text":"Try not to come here during Happy Hour on a Wednesday afternoon. There was only one server.  Asked for a Manhattan. Got it in on the rocks in a \"rocks glass\" (highball glass). I said, could you put it in a manhattan glass -- which I figured she'd assume it was a cocktail glass. Then she says in a condescending tone...  \"It is in a manhattan glass, honey.\" So I say, can you serve it off the rocks in one of those martini glasses. She says, \"oh, we don't have those kind of glasses.\" She took it back and pulled the ice cubes out of it.  Oh, and there were no cherries in the drink, so she brought over a bowl of cherries - like 15 of them.  I'd have given a 1 star rating but she did bring the bowl of cherries and I'll assume it was in good spirits, not an FU ;-)  When we were done we had to walk up to the bar and pay.  I'd probably wait until 4pm next time and go to Delaney's next door."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Felt like we were back home.   Very friendly staff and great prices. Pool tables, darts, pinball machines along with a great pizza place inside it.  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Never again. We went for wing night Wednesday and were sorely disappointed by the quality of the wings and the lack of good service.  First our waitress came of rather flirtatious towards me, in front of my wife. Awkward.....   She really never followed up on food or refills. I had to go to the bar to refill our pops.   The wings were very plain, there wasn't any real kick to them. You can add sauce, but what if you want an original wing? Why does it have to be boring?   We ordered the mushrooms which ran us $9.99 for 6 small mushrooms. What a rip-off.   This was my first and last time coming here.   SAD"}
{"text":"The server was trying and friendly but completely overwhelmed.  Someone please remind me not to come here anymore. The food is bad and expensive, and the service is seriously lacking. Sure, the portions are huge, but I can't really justify paying that much money for such low quality ingredients and poorly seasoned food."}
{"text":"This bar offered a karaoke competition that was in my view, very unfair, prejudiced and biased hosted by Brandi Morales. The only reason it is receiving one star is because zero stars are not offered. The bar needs to support their local patrons. I would like to speak to the manager or the owner about Brandi Morales and her karaoke competition.  She allowed a karaoke jockey (Frankie) a KJ that works part-time at Champagnes Cafe on Maryland Parkway, that has been a professional singer win top prize.  She allowed another man about 3 hours late for the competition to compete even after the judging was closed. Yes, that person also won a top spot.  I need to speak to a manager or owner of this bar.  They need to make it right with their loyal customers that participated."}
{"text":"You can't really judge a place by its outside appearance or location. I had the chicken tenders here. I was blown away. Even the fries were awesome. Dina took GREAT care of me. Be sure to tip her BIG. She's super sweet! The food is fresh, and super-delicious. I'll be back for sure with friends."}
{"text":"Interior was revamped ok, nothing spectacular. Bands setup offset, facing away from the bar. This is good and bad, keeping a majority of the loudness away from the Gamers, yet making it tough for most of the bar to see the band.  Very good Domestic Beer prices at $2.50, but the Liquor is another story, with Fireball Shots at $4.50. Higher than probably every bar within 5 miles. Most bars in the SouthEast are prices $3.00-$4.00.  Food is nothing spectacular, mostly frozen/fried appetizers. Jalapenos are fresh but flavor leaves a lot to be desired and with 6 halves on a plate, very over-priced.  Burgers are very small and not even close to worth the $7.00 charged. A $5.00 Burger at best.   Nachos are typical for a bar and way over-priced at $7.00  Make sure to lock your cars/trucks. Bikers, take your helmets inside as they have been stolen on each of multiple previous visits for multiple friends."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of any dive bar (usually) and this one is no exception. The neighborhood is a little sketchy, I will say that, but once inside, it's all good. Alcohol pricing isn't too bad, pretty typical for a bar of this type. 5 domestic beer bucket is $12, imports were $14, mixed drinks were like $6. A 16 ounce draft beer $3.50. They have some dart boards (not the good kind unfortunately, these are the plastic ones), a few pool tables and live music, which in my book is always worth an extra star. Support local musicians! I didn't eat here so no comment on the food. Staff was a little busy, so a bit of a wait for beer on the night I went. Friendly though, met some cool local yocals. Another plus in my book, although smoking is allowed, it didn't seem smokey nor did I smell like an ashtray when I left.  I'd come back if I had a reason too (like a good band)."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a couple of friends. I absolutely love it! Wasn't quite certain how it was going to be before walking in but once I did, I was glad I did! Awesome!  Everyone here is so laid back and it totally has that neighborhood bar type of feel. The patrons all the way down to the bartenders are really cool and are like your friends from jump street which makes this place really easy to consider your second home after just your first visit.  They have live music, a jukebox and I am told they have karaoke Thursdays. Don't want to just chill at the bar and drink while shooting the shhhhh, they have two pool tables, a Ms. Pac Man/Galaga machine and this really cool punching bag game! Great way to let out some steam after a long day at work!! Beers are pretty darn cheap in here too, so that's an added plus! I believe they have PBR on tap during Happy Hour for just a buck!!  Make sure you come down and check this place out. It's a pretty mid class place with dive bar prices.....and I love dive bars!!"}
{"text":"Generic sports bar in a generic building serving generic food.  Not bad.  Not good.  Just meh.  What more can I say?"}
{"text":"this use to be the best place in town to go to but recently they have had a lot of changes.  The best cook they had Timmy is not working there and neither was the best bartender they had Kathy.  The both displayed great customer service.  this place when down hill fast and its sad  i hope the owners wake up and see this before its just another failed bar on boulder highway!!!"}
{"text":"Long before I went to Legends my friend raved about their .10 cent wings so I couldnt wait to try this place!!  Well there were a little more to the wings being .10 cents.   First of all it had to be during a Badger or Packer game and the wings were more like .30 cents, which still wasnt bad.  I like this place.  They have really great wings, the prices for drinks are very reasonable and the crowd is super cool, at least they seemed that way after drink 5!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. :) It is a new favorite bar of mine. My boyfriend and I don't live far from it,but we just recently started going there. The people are friendly,they have good live music{I saw a now favorite local rock cover band there Friday nite},they have a jukebox and decent prices on mixed drinks. I had some apple martinis. The bartenders are also friendly. I will just say that the older male bartender gave a better price on my apple martinis than a female bartender gave when we went back the second time. But maybe he used cheaper vodka than she did. I would make this a regular stop. I also like the tapestries on the wall behind the stage. They also have some pics of bands on the wall. They have karaoke on Saturday nights,too. We will check that out."}
{"text":"Loose bar machines.            100% Quality of music.                    100% Multiple large TV for sports 100% Cheap drink prices.                100% Pool tables, darts, games.    100% LIVE BANDS !!!!!!                     100% LIVE POKER EVENTS.            100% Environment.                           100% People.                                     100% I guess I like the place."}
{"text":"My group of four was there last evening, Feb 5th for a free show byAKA DANGER.   Everything was outstanding!  The music was awesome, the drinks were great, the food was great (we had chicken fingers, wings and burgers)  The bartender worked her butt off and always was smiling and pleasant no matter how busy she got. If you haven't heard of AKA DANGER, the music is all original rock. Edgy lyrics. Great instrumentals.  We saw them at Tommy Rockers a few years ago, when they were called Resurrection LV - they said there was a band name change when they replaced the drummer and bass player. We've been to Legends before but its been a few years and there have been some improvements. And one of our friends hit Keno for $200! All in all we will be back!"}
{"text":"5 star bar ! Raiders Nation headquarters somewhere you have to stop by and watch the games. Silver and Black Sunday's great time !"}
{"text":"Sorry no time for a long review but just know the food is very good here the drinks are reasonable the bartenders are super friendly and have great music several nights a week plus karaoke"}
{"text":"As a Las Vegas native I've really gotten to know my local watering holes pretty well over the years. These neighborhood bars are usually all the same, gaming and no ambiance. Legends is a different story......You walk in and right away you get treated like family. Within minutes I had an awesome plate of spicy chicken wings in front of my poker machine. The bar tenders really know their drinks too. Just ask for the Cable Car and you'll know what I mean.   Good job Legend's staff......Keep up the good work and I'll see you soon."}
{"text":"I love all the bartenders here! The food is amazing! Try the bacon Jalapeño bites. The guy who hosts open mic comedy on Thursday is funny and handsome. Jim the owner is a gentleman and a swell dude. Come to legends and feel like family, family that you actually like."}
{"text":"Just waited ten minutes to get service and the bartender went and helped her 'friends' before us and made a point to say she was doing so. We also watched who I think was the manage walk by, look at us, then walk away.  Just visiting from out of town looking for a relaxing spot.  If rather pay three times as much and get better service than be here for their awesomely cheap drinks. Also asked for a food menu and got an eye roll from the bartender.  Isn't personality important in the service industry?"}
{"text":"Too bad this place closed down. Visited Madison Last year and found this place near my hotel. So this year I was looking forward to visiting again. It's closed down. Now a pizza place. rumor had it too many fights were going on."}
{"text":"Out of the way, and off the strip. A great choice for live music, plenty of dancing room with a hundred people in there. I left my Credit Card, and they are mailing it out to me. Great staff, friendly as you can be in a busy bar. I really enjoyed the staff, and sound system the most."}
{"text":"Went to see a friends band play here.  Terrible neighborhood.  I was a little hesitant on parking the car in the back.  Luckily all was good when we left.  The bar itself is a typical dive bar you would expect.  Service is not exceptional.  If you want something go to the bar.  Good was so so.  Ordered the nachos, they were plain nachos nothing to talk about.  They did have pinball and skeeball which was a plus.  Of course classic darts and a pool table. The place was much larger than I expected it to be.  Other than the food and location I would go back.  The live music was fun and the drinks were strong!"}
