{"text":"Previous reviewer has no idea what he is talking about. Have been ordering from this place for years . The food is always fresh and made to order. We have never been disappointed or ever gotten sick!!! The staff is friendly and welcoming. If you don't want msg added ask that they don't  add it. We do that and it's fine. Prices are reasonable and the prices are very generous."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food, you might as well just eat a whole bag of sugar and salt while you're at it"}
{"text":"This place is now under new ownership and had my first try with this  new place last week. Tried some fried rice and it was great, they also let me order even though I came when they were closing. I'm now back again to try a different dish to see if this will become my new favorite place for Chinese food"}
{"text":"It's your standard Chinese restaurant. The dinner for 2 has enough food for 4 and the prices are standard. Staff is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"So gross. Like, you'll end up in the ER getting your stomach pumped gross. They should rename this place MSG Sentral! Food has no flavor or spice, too much salt on everything, mains are always over-sauced, hardly any meat in the mains, overpriced, TERRIBLE service both at the store and especially over the phone. I have no idea how these guys have been in business for so long, with so many new restaurants in the area I don't suspect they'll last. Or why I keep ordering from this hellhole. I always forget that two new Chinese/Hakka joints opened up within 5 mins of here, so ya, go elsewhere for Chinese food or make sure you've got a toilet or a hospital nearby."}
