{"text":"Always a pleasure to dine at Tango. Tonight we had everything with goat cheese and even asked the kitchen to create a new dish   for us. Well we just added goat cheese to a flat bread. Everything was delicious especially the beet fries. They were extra tasty tonight. Our server Kelly was very attentive and lovely. Tango is a great choice for first dates and an evening out with friends . The meal share program is a wonderful idea. Buy a meal for you and a meal is donated. The decor is kind of modern in the bar area and kind of rustic in the dinning area. Either way it works and you feel good eating there. Give a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really liked my first visit to Tango Bistro. Service was impeccable. The tapas were good although what holds me back from giving Tango Bistro 5 stars is the Pulled Pork Poutine fell a little flat for me. The dish was smoky from chipotle peppers but the combination of smokiness, pork and curds did not work for me. I found the Poutine was too dry as well. We loved the other tapas and our drinks. The bill came to a little over $60, which I thought was good value for what we got.  I would go back to Tango Bistro but wouldn't go out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant!! Delicious tapas!! Great selection of wines and good costumer service!!"}
{"text":"Great food! They do a great job Indicating potential allergic concerns. They have a number of gluten free dishes that were really tasty."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and had higher expectations of this place.  We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation and it took the hostess 5 minutes to figure out that we were who we said we were.  We sat down and our server promptly gave us water...which is great except there was a chard of glass in its, but she replaced it quickly. We started off with the shortrib risotto. Risotto can go extremely well, or horribly wrong, but this turned out really good. It was rich and creamy and the shortrib was perfectly cooked. Second up was the cheese fondue, and it was far from cheese, or fondue. It was more like clarified butter in consistency. The items included with the cheese fondue were pickels (??) two kinds of charcuterie meat (?) and a small piece of bread that was slightly stale. After was the mixed grill. This had venison sausage, which was good, a small steak, which was lukewarm, There were also the ribs, and those were good, but a bit cold. Then we got dessert. The desserts there aren't priced like normal restaurants at this level, which is normally $8, these were $4.5 each for most. I had the chai bread pudding - looove bread pudding. This was stale, and had butter at the bottom, no chai flavoring at all. Like Notable - they do a great bread pudding, which is soft and not too moist that it breaks apart in much. This one at Tango was hard and it broke apart in dry chunks. Sigh, after that our waitress took a $20 from us and took 15 minutes to come back to us for our change. We both got the feeling she wanted us to tip her the whole $20 and was waiting us out, it was very uncomfortable. She also didn't listen very well, because when she repeated what I said, she kept getting things wrong. I heard her do it to another table as well, and when she responded they both gave her quizzical looks. Anyways, I feel like Tango could be a good restaurant, but it needs to tweak a few things. I give it a 2.5 in all."}
{"text":"Second time here yesterday, first time was with work and the service and food were great, especially for a big group. Yesterday I  took my skeptical boyfriend with me this time and he loved it too :) Great service, Great food! And half price wine on Wednesday! :) Our Favorites were the Pear and Gorgonzola Flatbread ($5 on Wednesdays too) and any of the Bison items, but anything we ordered was great.  Only sort of disappointment was the S mores dessert, it was good, but not what I expected."}
{"text":"Myself & 5 others ate here recently including my parents & kids one of which is a teenager and everyone enjoyed the experience greatly. The atmosphere was good and I waiter (unfortunately I don't recall his name) excellent both in attitude and service. We tried probably 12 to 15 dishes including some salads as well as desert and really enjoyed almost everything, I say almost everything because the crap cakes were not the favourite of anyone (way to salty). I was able to get a reservation the night before hand and even changed our reservation last minute and they were very accommodating.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone especially large groups that like to share and try a little of everything."}
{"text":"I love coming here.    We enjoy meat and cheese boards, and they offer both here which is a nice option.   The scallops are amazing!  Although an indulgence, the poutine is one of my favs.   The tasting menu portions are large enough to feel as though you truly did have a \"taste\" of the meal.    As for wine, I am not a fan of their wine list, and end up settling on a wine i don't prefer - but I have attempted almost all of them.      I love the environment and decor.  Its a nice place to eat, and share some time with friends and loved ones."}
{"text":"just a few tweaks - I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could - went after the premiere of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (won tickets, great, funny movie), restaurant was vitually empty still sat in front of door. Server was pleasant and knowledgeable but unfortunately the menu wasn't. Had the unvanilla martini, not to my taste but I think that was personnel. Asked to start with the pear and gorgonzola pizza then the tournedos with crab, shrimp and lobster with hollondaise and the sea bass. Tournedos and sea bass came out first with the pizza trailing far behind. Tournedos were a very generous size, good toppings - only complaint was that there was pesto on the plate not mentioned in the menu which hubbie didn't think paired well with the hollondaise, I thought it was okay. Sea bass was lovely, and loved, loved the mushroom quinoa risotto. Pizza on the outside pieces were yummy but inside was soggy, over cheesed (and I love blue cheese) and there were lots of pine nuts on it, again not mentioned on the menu. We both really like pine nuts so happily munched away but it's an expensive ingredient not to mention on the menu. Definitely full after these three generous plates although the server had recommended at least four I would order sparingly and order more as needed. For three plates (on the expensive side on the menu) and the martini $55 including tax and tip well worth it, easily four start when they fix the minor gripes with service and menu."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Tango Bistro. Had bought the $20 dollar coupon via Groupon and thought, \"what the heck!\".  Loved all six dishes we ordered in this order:  Wonton Crusted Prawns, Roasted Baby Beet and Apple Salad, Warm Pecan Crusted Goat Cheese, Calamari Fritta, Pear and Gorgonzola Flatbread, Braised Lamb Shoulder. Excellent dishes using only fresh ingrediants -- wow, we are definitely going back to try more. Also, for dessert we had the pumpkin with chocolate mousse...yummy! Definitely try this dessert if you love pumpkin. They make this dish fresh each morning."}
{"text":"Took my wife out here for her birthday dinner. This was the second time we have been here after being very impressed the first time. The two of us ordered 6 different dishes, wine, and the dessert sampler. Every single dish was incredibly good and we were more than full by the end of the night.    Dishes are small appetizer sizes but are meant to share with others and kind of accompany how you interact with your company. Don't be deceived by the small portion sizes and order many dishes. The fact that the pace of eating is slower, you will feel full quicker than you realize because your stomach has time to digest all of the goodness.  Highly recommend the scallops, surf and turf, and the bison chilli mac and cheese.  This is a must eat restaurant in Calgary! Thanks again Tango for being incredible!"}
{"text":"My Favorite restauraunt in Calgary. Awesome food, great atmosphere at a decent price. You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money, go elsewhere. there are better restaurants in the area. overpriced and overrated, lack of managment, they should change their front manager!!"}
{"text":"We went there as a result of their Valentine's day promo on Facebook. It was limited (especially for non-wine drinkers) compared to the whole menu, so we just ordered off that. Overall the food was great and the wonton shrimp was a nice twist. We ordered a pineapple/flatbread dish that we didn't care for but to each their own. The chocolate truffles at the end were amazing! Still want to back a few times to firm up an opinion."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch at Tango yesterday and it was excellent. We both had steak frites and it was the most tender piece of meat I've ever eaten. It was cooked to perfection. My husband had chèvre with bacon jam and crostini as an appetizer and hasn't stopped raving about it. I had Caesar salad. It was not your traditional caesar. It was 3 small hearts of romaine which was grilled. This too was excellent. I highly recommend. Service was exceptional!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so I was told that tapas was supposed to be fun because you get to socialize while eating food that is a real treat. This does not describe this place. Your at cramped little tables even when you make reservations weeks in advance for a large group.  They bring drinks that are usually what you ordered pretty fast but the food service took forever.  When it did arrive some was cold and had to be sent back and what was hot was small or should I say tiny and not at all worth the wait or price.  Maybe if you're hammered this place is great."}
{"text":"I like this place because the food is great, but I am not keen on the atmosphere.  There is a huge fireplace which might feel cozy, but I find the place \"cold\"  I think it's all the stainless steel and hard wood furniture.  I always feel like I need to leave or I am not meant to stay very long, but I still think the food is great."}
{"text":"Before checking out a comedy show, a girlfriend and I wanted to have a light dinner. Since she had such a great experience at Tango before, I was totally up for another go at trying tapas.  I was expecting it to be super busy considering it was a Saturday and the parking lot was ridiculously full, but it surprisingly quiet empty in Tango. (I think because there's 4 full sized restaurants in this building you're battling all these people for parking)  We were seated at a window table and our server was kind enough to take our bottle of wine to chill while we settled in and looked over the menu. Honestly everything sounded amazing, but we had to keep in mind we couldn't eat ourselves to a food coma since we were heading out after. We decided on the wonton crusted prawns, cedar baked brie, prosciutto wrapped asparagus and seared scallops.  The food was nicely timed, we were able to enjoy each dish before the next came out and they were all amazing in their own way. The prawns were crunchy, brie was gooey goodness accompanied by a tangy cranberry & orange compote and both the asparagus and scallops were cooked to perfection.  My arm didn't have to be twisted to get some dessert -  the ice cream sandwich with habanero gelato sounded interesting. The first few bites were good, but the gelato got overpowering - the spiciness kind of attacked your throat like you were doing the cinnamon challenge. I'm glad I tried something different but I don't think I'd get it again.  Looks like team tapas is slowly winning me over :)"}
{"text":"Overall a decent experience. Can't beat the 5 course wine paring experience. Tapas served.   Best dish was easily the mushroom soup!  Shrimp wontons were great.   Duck flatbread was just ok with some soggy areas and fatty meat.   Desert was great and service was great as well.   I would give it a shot. ;)"}
{"text":"They say it takes two to Tango, and this is definitely the case a Calgary's Tango Bistro.  This trendy tapas place is all about sharing. The portion sizes are small, the ingredients and experiences positively decadent.  Our server gave us a few recommendations on glasses of white wine. I had a glass of Main Divide Sauvignon Blanc -- full-bodied with a clean finish -- and my girlfriend had a glass of an Italian Pinot Grigio.   With our wines, we had the apple and baby beet salad (which had a fantastic shaved Spanish cheese on it, served with arugula), wild boar bacon-wrapped beef tenderloin (which was unreal), and a pear, gorgonzola and pesto flatbread (droooooool).  The food was great -- perfect for sharing -- and our server was terrific. He made great recommendations and was attentive, though not intrusive.  If you're looking for something light, and the opportunity to sample many different dishes, you need to go to Tango. And make sure you bring a dance partner too."}
{"text":"I had a great experience going to this place for brunch. Variety and quality of the buffet food was easily above average, if not among the bests. You probably need to make reservations as this place is usually jam packed."}
{"text":"Tango Bistro is a tapas restaurant that has been carved out of the Smuggler's complex.  It is a very clean and modern room very different from it's past life as part of Smugglers.  The small plates concept is done very well with many to choose from.  We had a large-ish group of 12 so we asked the server is she would pick for the table.  We told her of one plate that we definitely wanted & one that we did not want and she did the rest.  We were very happy with the overall quality of the dishes and the service.  We also found the pricing quite reasonable as dinner for 12 with alcohol was $440 before tip.  I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We decided to try out Tango Bistro's dinner menu, since we regularly go there for brunch.  I have to say, we were not disappointed with our orders. I loved how there was time in between each food. The restaurant atmosphere was vibrant yet it felt relaxing.   It's so hard to pick a favourite amongst our orders. But if I must, I'd pick the fresh oysters, tuna tataki and mac-&-cheese. Oh! I almost forgot the table side s'mores! Oh... s'mores!!!!!!!!!   I loved the infused alcohol served with the oysters, along with traditional flavourings. As per the tuna tataki, I am not a fan of wasabi. Yet the mixture of wasabi aioli and the ponzu sauce with the tuna, was a great combination. It wasn't too creamy and not overly sauced either. Honestly I could've eaten that whole order by myself. The mac-&-cheese, creamy and not too cheesy. The thick cut bacon and mushroom, gave the dish that extra flavour. If I wasn't so full, I would've ordered another mac-&-cheese.  Mmm... S'mores! S'mores don't need to be described! But I sure like the fact that they serve s'mores!"}
{"text":"I don't think I had high hopes for Tango but I also wasn't expecting to be as unmoved as I was either.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly hostess that lead us over to a booth, I noticed as we were walking that it was just us in this pretty large space and it felt a bit awkward.   When we sat down and looked over the menu I saw a lot of things that sounded very delicious - I cannot say the same about the wine menu though, it is REALLY lacking in options.  The ambience felt like we were sitting in a primped up Denny's, there were tent cards on the tables and the staff kept loitering/chatting in the middle bar, which was right in front of us which made the experience much less enjoyable.  The food was mediocre at best. We ordered the seared scallops which were tasty; I liked the addition of mushrooms. We also had the trio dips (awful), the beet chips and the mixed meat grill.  The dips were pretty bad in our opinion... very greasy and lacked flavour, the beet chips disappointed me because I was expecting thin slices but they showed up as overly deep fried wedges.   We did enjoy the selection on the mixed meat grill though, the steak was great - but when you factor in everything into this I would not go back."}
{"text":"Now I'm not much of a dancer, being more clumsy than I am co-ordinated but I love Tango!  Me and one of my main girls headed here to hit the menu one more time before it changes in May mainly because we luv, luv, luv that pear and gorgonzola flatbread and spend at least 15 minutes plotting how to recreate it in our own kitchen lairs every time we have it, haha, ya right, that'll happen! But it is so simple and simply delilsh every time, can't rant about it enough. RANT!  We also had the pulled pork poutine this time around which when served was not quite right. The point of poutine is that the cheese curds are ooowie and stringy and gooey, amirite? It was not. But they took it away and remade it. Then it was all good, crispy perfect fries, gooey cheese and tender meatiness. And the waitress was very patient with me considering when I complain I can be pretty specific about how I want  things corrected, but I really love it when people are on their customer service and suffer my impertenance without getting annoyed. What a treat!  We also had a salad with goat cheese and a pomegranate compote that had some really nicely balanced flavours and considering we were just feeling a little snacky, we ate a lot of food and had a grand time.  They did kind of forget about us after we paid the bill an we could have used some more water near the end there but then again they might have just been afraid that we might have ordered more wine. :| Oh well."}
{"text":"We had an amazing evening the food was fantastic and the service was outstanding.  We enjoyed every aspect the ambiance was wonderful!  Thoroughly enjoyed the experience from appetizers to desserts"}
{"text":"Went for Saturday morning brunch, wow what a disappointment from when Smugglers served us brunch, they have tried to go upscale in their new setup, but have gone down scale in food quality, no taste, Benny over done and hard, NO quality control, save your hard earned dollars and stay away."}
{"text":"Tango Bistro is a mix of contemporary and rustic, from it's decor to their interpretation of tapas-style casual dining. The menu offers up a delightful variety of small, sharable plates made for 2-3 people, making Tango a perfect place for a first date.   Tango prides itself on its menu, which embraces the best in local and regional ingredients. The dishes are twists of classics from all over the world, made with the tapas format in mind, artfully assembled with a modern presentation. Food is visually appealing and equally as tasty.   Some memorable standouts include:  Cajun Chicken Egg Rolls - These were a fusion style of egg roll with ground chicken, goat cheese, roast corn, black beans and cilantro accompanied by what tasted like a chipotle aioli.  Cedar Baked Brie - A simple and unassuming presentation until you make the first cut into the warm Brie. The melted insides come oozing out onto the cedar plank as the sour cherries cascade down to complete the picture. On the side, plenty of baguette slices and flatbread for spreading. Beautiful.  Patatas Bravas - A cast-iron skillet of oven roasted new potatoes with a tomato sauce with what tasted like smoked paprika. On top, a healthy (or unhealthy, however you want to interpret it) dollop of garlic aioli. The crispy roasted potatoes are complemented by the hints of smokiness from the tomato sauce all brought home by the creamy aioli.   Tournedo Surf and Turf - a selection of 3 hearty pieces of beef, cook to a medium rare, topped with Shediac Bay Lobster, crab and a large tiger prawn (also cooked til just perfect... a rarity). The beef was flavourful and tender as were the toppings. The lobster serving was a little on the light side, but the prawn's flavour was the highlight of this one. It was crisp and slightly sweet, not overcooked. Delicious.  If you're with a group of 3 or 4, definitely try the sampler dessert. It includes shot glasses of assorted selections and a few truffle pops to finish you off.  Overall, the experience was good. The idea of a light, sharable dinner makes for a great interactive evening of discovery and great conversation. I did like the presentation of the dishes and the freshness of the ingredients were top notch. The only thing that doesn't make this a 4 or 5 rating is the menu itself. It's a great interpretation of some familiar dishes, but nothing truly inspired. Tango is a step up from the standard casual dining fare with a new format but not much more."}
{"text":"Very fun meal. Im a cheapskate so the price threw me off at first. But after the meal i had decided it was well worth it. Beautiful meat and shells."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! We have enjoyed our evenings out here at least six times already!!!! Hopefully many more to come! The food is always amazing!!! They make up little tapas sharing plates in such great tasting ways that everyone will want to keep coming back!!! The atmosphere is always pleasant... classy but not too formal.  And the wait staff are always extremely pleasant and accommodating!  A great place to go with a few friends so you get to try a little of lotsa different items."}
{"text":"What a change from Smugglers, its now modern and clean.  Greeted by the hosts desk that fronts a nicely displayed glass wine case, we were seated in front of the centrally located fireplace.  An LCD TV occupied a corner...yay...you catch a glimpse of the Flames game.  Theres a nice selection of Tapas that decent in size.  Had the tagliatelle pasta, which was big enough as a main dish for one on its own.  Mushrooms were yummy and the sauce creamy.  Grilled steak flatbreak was yummy as well. The pulled pork poutine was um....yummy! Cant argue with poutine right? The seared scallops was done to perfection too.  Not undercooked not overcooked....seared to a golden brown on the outside and soft but not quite raw on the inside.  Um...they were yummy! Maybe I was hungry...but everything was yummy and will certainly come here again in the near future.  Pssst...try the Viru beer because of the wierd looking bottle.  :) Cheers !"}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I came to try Tango on a Thurs night before the dinner rush.  So glad we did!  She told me that it was a tapas style restaurant. I had never been to any of the 4 restaurants in this building so I had no idea what it would be like. I prefer to eat small plates over a large, heavy meal so this seemed to be right up my alley. I noted a clean space and amazing, modern decor upon entry. We were seated just off the central cozy fireplace area with a nice view of the bar. We had a fantastic server who was very attentive and our water glasses never went dry. Love the little cranberries floating on top in the water! Little details really mean everything including the delicious mint chocolate at the end of the meal! On this evening they had a 4-6pm special where if you ordered a drink, you got a free tapas item, free. Sweet! Tonight chef`s choice was my fave - crab cakes. So we each got one to try with our drinks at the start. We enjoyed a Peartini and Raspberry lemonade. Both were martinis and were pretty tasty! We ordered the Hunter Chicken that comes with fresh mushrooms and brussel sprouts. The gravy on the plate was sooo yummy! Lastly, we ordered the Scallops that come on a parsnip puree and wild mushrooms. All the dishes were very good. I cannot pick a fave.  The prices were reasonable. There cannot possibly be line cooks back there - this did taste like Chef-y food. Or maybe I was really starving. No, it was very good. The scallops were smaller than normal we were told, so we got a couple extra brought out on the plate. The food served is meant for sharing and do not come out in any order, just sporadically and one at a time. I kind of liked it as it allowed for good conversation, not face-stuffing-before-it gets-cold time. I had another cocktail, California something that was decent and my friend was raving about these Grizzly Soda soda pop things (she got a black cherry one) that you can only get in Canmore where it is crafted and bottled... OR here apparently according to the manager. LOL! What a great way to have us come back! No problem there, I want to come back with everyone I know and also try the other 3 restaurants - Smuggler`s, Bolero and Open Sesame that are all owned by the same person who seems to be doing something very right!"}
{"text":"We had the French Onion soup and a desert last night.  Excellent.  The decor is very well done.   Service is excellent.  The menu is all high end gourmet and the price reflects it so don't expect a big plate of ribs and a bib for $9 or anything like that but if you are looking for an excellent high end dining experience this is your spot in Calgary."}
{"text":"Tango and lunch, sounds like a spectacular day to me! All in all? Pretty close to that mark!  I went to Tango with a friend, just a \"quick catch up\" and was very pleasantly surprised for my first visit. The staff was extremely friendly and very prompt with service throughout our stay.  Little niceties such as garnished water (and I do not mean your typical lemon slice wedge either, my glass was adorned with lovely floating cranberries and lemons, perhaps I am strange for enjoying this explosion of color?) and perfect portioning combined with an excellent \"lunch\" menu are cause to rejoice in this city as far as I am concerned.  The food, as I mentioned, was portioned perfectly in our lunch orders, the bisque was magnificent, though a hair overcooked... My glazed salmon was thoroughly enjoyable, it was not undercooked, nor overcooked, which is somewhat rare with fast lunch service. My friend had the lamb burger and thoroughly enjoyed it, and she remarked that it was  moist and friendly on her palate.  With the prices what they are, and the food what it is, I will certainly return again and again when I am in the area for lunch!"}
{"text":"UGH!!!  I came here with a friend for brunch...we wanted to go to the Smuggler's Inn brunch which used to be to die for! Instead now it's at Tango and it sucks.   They make you go in the Tango door, even though they seat people in the Smuggler's area. We got there at 11, it wasn't too busy, got a table and away we went...to a damn near empty buffet. Great...  We were told not to worry it would be filled at some point. Not that I care, but there was no waffles for at least 45 minutes while we were there. The selection was terrible, you had to custom order eggs from the omelet station, to just get regular eggs. Minimal fruit, which I enjoy, as a lot of people do.   I'm not sure what the cost was, as my meal was paid for. I've heard good things about their food for dinner, but steer clear if you want buffet, so to Blackfoot Inn."}
{"text":"Tango is a great place to go with a group. Everything here is served tapas-style and there seems to be something for everyone. Anything vegan, vegetarian, or gluten-free is clearly labelled on the menu and there is plenty to choose from. As the loan vegetarian in a large group of meat-eaters during my last visit, I did not go without. The pear and gorgonzola flatbread and the dip trio were especially delicious. Of course the menu is always updating and changing so you never know what's going to be on it.   Aside from great lunch and dinner menus, Tango also offers and outstanding brunch buffet complete with a make-your-own omelette stand and an array of other breakfast favourites. They even include some desserts in case you weren't already full.  The last time I visited, our server was a real treat. He was super friendly and even pretended to laugh at some of my dad's lamer jokes. Now THAT is going above and beyond! This is a great restaurant that always offers a consistently pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"The six of us had lunch here today.  We all enjoyed it.  Reasonable prices for the \"business lunch\" which gives you several options to build your own lunch.  A soup, a sandwich and an accompaniment. I had the cream of mushroom soup, smoked salmon custini and yam fries with spicy aioli.  I loved it.  The quality was great, not huge portions but satisfying.  The service was excellent.  We all agreed we would return based on this experience."}
{"text":"Went to this place on multiple occasions and for multiple reasons, I confess the display of wine bottles makes for nice decoration. I went for lunch with a special lady and the food was phenomenal. The meals tasted freshly cooked and the portions were exactly what you would expect, reasonable, but smaller, to better appreciate them. Some dishes on the menu just had to be tried for their ingenuity and interesting flavor combinations. I also went for their brunch on Sunday mornings. I confess I had heard countless remarks on the greatness of this feast, and it turns out they were true... Go figure! The buffet was large, with items not commonly found in buffets, at least from my experience. There were loads of sea foods, and meats, Egg Benedict and lots of other delicacies, The best part is that they were all calling my name, so I tried every dish (yes my stomach was a bit distended after) and was not disappointed.  The largest asset to the restaurant is their friendly staff and intricate menu. To elaborate on the staff, on my latest visit I was waited on by a multilingual gentleman who had a good sense of humor. He went by the name of Etienne, by the end of the meal, he had made a lasting impression making me want to return for another meal. I will definitely remember that the staff have outdone themselves to offer the best service that they could. That being said, I must warn that parking may be scarce due to there being many other food establishments in close vicinity but I recommend The tango bistro as it is a good experience."}
{"text":"I was here last week for lunch with my sister, she had been here a few times before and really liked it. This is a tapas restaurant, but unlike some I have been to, I found the portions bigger than normal, which for someone like me is a good thing.  We both ordered off of the lunch special where you got to choose 3 different items from each section of the lunch menu. I ordered the Naan with 2 different dips, bread was warm and lovely with 2 dips a hummous and a tapenade.   I also ordered the paparadelle with wild mushrooms and cream ( delicious, but the pasta could have been a bit warmer). As well I had a lovely baby green salad with roasted yellow beet chips.  All of that came to just 15 dollars. Great price.  Our server was friendly and the decor was very cool.  Strangely though on 2 different occasions people came in to eat, checked the menu and then left. I guess they either dont understand the concept of tapas or just didn't like the menu. Either way they were missing out on some tasty food.  I was there on a Saturday and it was pretty dead, which is surprising considering my experience and the experience of others on here. Check it out, it would be a shame to lose this gem."}
{"text":"Had a tremendous evening there! Service excellent! Food delicious. Francesca our waitress was a doll. Thanks for everything! Will come back when we come to Calgary again!"}
{"text":"They have recently changed their menu from tapas to \"bistro style\"  The prices have gone up and in my opinion the menu isn't as good.  Their \"Business lunch\" is now $20 instead of $16. They said it was larger portions, seemed pretty similar to before.  Ordered the Brisket Burger which was good but came with literally just a tiny bit of melted cheese on it. No sauce, no basic burger things like lettuce and tomato. The server did offer me bacon or a fried egg when I ordered it but I assumed it would come with at least some kind of basic burger things.   It was alright, but thought it was way better before.  (Would have rated the old menu/style a 4/5)"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, very clean restaurant.  Food was very flavorful.  Had the Gnocchi, Braised Short Rib, Salmon, and parmesan frites.  Gnocchi was slightly overcooked, but the flavor of the dish was great.  Braised short rib and salmon cooked perfectly.  Parmesan frites...nice!!  Drinks were made very well.  Will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant has gone from one of our favorites to the bottom of the pack.  We had not been in a while and felt like Tapas last night so imagine our surprise when they are no longer a Tapas place... We stayed anyway which was the first mistake.  Their menu is now pretty standard non-descript expensive food... Who has to pay $8.00 for mashed potatoes... Who goes to a place and would just eat a slab of salmon with no veggies... The only saving grace was our server was an absolute charm.  We will never be back. Same reason we abandoned the Keg restaurant 20 years ago... I wont' pay extra for veggies to go with my protein. Oh and to top it off my wife's steak was raw in spots and well done in others.... Terrible uneven cook on the meat.. She was told they cook it that way to keep it tender..."}
{"text":"Very cool setting, they keep bringing you delicious appetizers. I don't know if it's great for kids but it's wonderful for date night or a group. All the food and drinks are great and the service is good as well, pretty pricy!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. Never had a bad meal. Lots of beef and seafood choices and good wine and drink list.   My wife requires gluten free food and they had a great selection of appetizers and entrees and the quality of her food was excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down this is one of my favorite places to eat. Amazing and interesting shareable plates makes this a great place to meet friends or take family. We have come here many times and the service and food is always exceptional. The Beet Fries are delicious, and the dessert try the Sampler  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for valentines and we had an amazing experience. We had the scallops, escargot and seafood tower all were absolutely amazing. One of the best parts of the evening was our server Nathan. He was extremely friendly and helpful, super easy to talk to. He made the experience super special for us. This was our first time at Tango but we will be sure to return again and bring our friends. Thanks Nathan and the other Tango staff for one of my favourite dining experiences of my life"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. After having randomly going there for Valentine's a few years back, it's become a staple for me. My wife and I go there every few months and it never disappoints. Great tapas style foods, interesting dishes and a good price for the value."}
{"text":"As a semi regular it's about time I write something.   Tango is excellent. Excellent service every time and the food is delicious.    First remember this is a tapas/shared plates restaurant. You're best to order a whole variety of items and share them. We use to come here for the fondue plate but the only down point I'll say is they've taken that off the menu. It has though made us try new items such as the amazing beet fries (if you don't like beets you can get the yam fries instead) also their Tuna Poke Tacos and Mac and Cheese (which is very good though they've changed this as well and I preferred the old one a bit more though my husband's more of a fan of their new version)   Once you're done the main items save room and try their 4 shot glass desserts, it doesn't sound like much but there's quite a bit of lovely sweetness packed it in this dish.   As a creeper who listens to other people conversations....either that or some people just talk very very loudly.... I've heard almost everything we've been there the tables around us saying 'this is excellent' 'wow, so yummy' and all that jazz.   They have multiple different specials on different days including free corkage days so check those out as well.  Summary: great service, great food, never had to wait (though this review may screw me on that one......hmmmm.... still worth sharing I guess) and lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went to tango tonight for a family dinner and it was great.  The new decor is a bright light (literally) from the dark cave like atmosphere of smugglers. The food was all really amazing, our favorites were the seared scallops with mushrooms and parsnip purée & the bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates.   If you're looking for a nice place to grab some drinks and a light snack or a full meal Tango is a great choice.  The one and only downside is with 4 restaurants in the one building there is a severe lack of parking."}
{"text":"I've been twice and really took my time deciding how I felt about Tango. The concept, location and menu sound great, but obviously there is something amiss (me and hubby are the only people on the patio on a Saturday night in August?). We tried a lot of things on the menu that were great, and a few things that were just so close to being great but missed the mark. For instance, the pear and Gorgonzola flatbread excited me on the menu and disappointed me upon tasting. There was too much Gorgonzola, the pear added a nice crunch but not enough sweetness to balance the cheese, and then suddenly the flavor of the pesto sauce hits you and it's confusing, just a little too much going on. I thought of my pear, Gorgonzola and honey pizza at Cibo, and realized they had it right. When I bit into that pizza, I had my 'oh my God this is so good!' moment, with the honey rounding that dish out perfectly. But curiosity will bring me back to Tango at least once more. I still haven't tried the gnocchi or the avocado and goat cheese salad.  In the mean time, remember that the lobster roll and pear flatbread are worth missing, and the cedar Brie and beef poutine will probably make you smile."}
{"text":"I had a lovely experience here this past Friday! My sister, my boyfriend, and I decided to have dinner somewhere on MacLeod Trail, seeing as how we wanted to go rollerskating at Lloyd's afterwards. Originally we had planned to go to Cactus Club but they do not take reservations, so we decided on Tango Bistro. Having driven by plenty of times, it was an ideal location so I was sold.  Although the place doesn't look like much outside, it's beautiful inside. We were immediately taken to our booth which was in a great spot, except the sunset beading through the blinds directly into my eyeballs. Our server was so sweet he graciously adjusted them for us, crisis averted!! We decided to bring our own bottle of wine per Raissa R.'s suggestion, and I was SO glad we did! We were brought our wine glasses immediately along with a chiller to keep the bottle cool. Very helpful!   As it is a tapas-style restaurant, we ordered the cheese plate and the house olives to share. For $15 it was a steal - we had 3 HUGE chunks of delicious cheese with an assortment of crackers and spreads. Beautiful presentation and well worth our money. The house olives were simple but delicious, paired with the cheese they were a hit! We also shared the pear & blackberry arugula salad, which was beautiful. Next we ordered the seared scallops, which were absolutely wonderful - served on a bed of beautifully cooked mushrooms, they were cooked to perfection! Along with those we had the crab cakes, which I personally was not a big fan of. My sister really enjoyed them so it was just my personal preference. Finally, we had the pear gorgonzola flatbread, which was TO DIE FOR. And it was huge! We were all absolutely stuffed. I was worried about sharing tapas (not enough food for this piggie) but the portions were actually very generous. My only minor complaint would be the timing, it seemed like everything all came out at once, it would have been perfect if the dishes came one after the other, as we were left without much room on our table!  There were tons of yummy looking desserts on the menu as well, but once again we were all completely stuffed. My boyfriend had a coffee and my sister ordered a cocktail, and our bill came out to less than $100! I was so impressed. Bringing our own wine was definitely a smart idea, seeing as how we were only charged a $12 corking fee (the price of a glass at most restaurants) and given how full we were, I thought this was such a steal given the amount and quality of food we had. I will ABSOLUTELY be back to try more of what Tango has to offer."}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant. Our meal was so divine; seriously, I can't stop thinking about it. We sat outside on the patio to enjoy the sunshine and it was marvelous.  Most of the dishes are made to share so my friend and I shared a salad - oh the pear salad is amazing - the surf and turf and the dessert platter. The steak was probably one of the juiciest steaks I've ever eaten; thinking about it makes my mouth water. The shrimp that topped it were done perfectly, not over cooked and were sautéed in the perfect amount of sauce. The presentation of the dish; impeccable.   Onto dessert... holy try the sampler it gives you just enough of each dessert that you want more, but enough that you will be to try all of the ones in front of you. The raspberry truffle cake pops were my favorite but all of the little desserts in shot glasses were adorable and scrumptious. Our server was excellent, the martini I had was great and I loved that our water was infused with fruit, it really gives a restaurant a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Tango, you're a cozy little bistro. Modern decor, a crackling fire place in the far corner, hard wood floors, semi round booths and an array of different tables and seating arrangements.  I love that I was greeted promptly at the door (though it was 530 and still rather early for dinner) and that our server (thanks Ian!) gave us a little spiel about how a tapas place is meant for sharing, so nothing comes out in full meal sizes.  Service and decor, Tango's got that spot on. 4.75 stars all the way.  What I wasn't as impressed with was the food. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it was 3 star good, like ok food trying to be fancy just not quite making the cut.  What you need to try: the wild mushroom soup. I am a lover of mushroom soups. Since I was 3 yrs old, my favourite meal has been a bowl full of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup. Well, this little bowl full of awesomeness blew that out of the water any day. That's saying a lot for my favourite food of the last more than twenty some years.   The wonton crusted prawns. They were big, they were just battered enough and I enjoyed the sauce they came with.   What was just ok: The poutine. It was a big beautiful bowl full of fries, cheese curds, and mesquite chicken. Instead of gravy, it was supposed to be mesquite sauce. Something needs to change with that sauce. I felt like all they did was pour a bunch of BBQ sauce over the fries. If you're trying to do something different with a classic like poutine, you'd better blow me out of the water. This didn't.  The gnocchi. Call me spoiled, the first time I ever tried gnocchi was in Italy. I usually don't eat it if it's not a super food snob Italian preparing it. This reminded me why. Again, it's not that it was bad, it was actually quite flavourful and I loved the bits of sausage on top. The pasta itself though, waaaaay too squishy. Yes, it was squishy. Gnocchi should not be squishy.  Come on Tango, step it up. You're three quarters of the way there, I feel like you're the smart kid in class who knows they're smart and is coasting on through on a B- when they've got the makings of an A+ valedictorian."}
{"text":"Discovered this place after trying some of their food at the Big Rock Eddies. Although its a big dining room, the place feels super quaint with nice dim lighting and it's actually quiet enough to have a conversation with your date or friends. Love the tapas style of their menu, and they always have great features. Every time I go, the service has been super friendly and charming. The poutines are GINORMOUS and their roast chicken and risotto dish is such a comfort staple."}
{"text":"We went on a busy Saturday night and were able to get reservations right away. Staff was friendly. It is a tapas style restaurant, so your meal is selected from a list of different appetizer sized foods and is shared among the table. The tapas come out as they're prepared, so they are always hot and allows you to pace yourself. Nearly everything we got was amazing! I loved the lobster rolls, mushroom soup and mini surf and turf. Which is saying a lot, because I'm not the biggest fan of seafood.  We also ordered the duck flat bread which was gross, but as soon as we made mention of it to our server, it was whisked away and removed from the bill. This is a great place to go if you're looking for a fun and different dining experience.  Note: Since everything is a shared plate, you may want to only enjoy this restaurant with smaller groups or when ordering for larger groups get more then one plate of each type of tapas."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today, looking forward to their excellent small plates. We hadn't  been there for a while and didn't realize the menu  and concept had changed to bistro style. The food was OK but not nearly as good as the previous menu.  I also found it to be a bit pricey. The restaurant was busy so I think others are enjoying the new concept. It's just not for me. Will likely not be back as there are so many other restaurants with food that's just as good but not as expensive."}
{"text":"My first and only experience here was for a birthday party.  I like the decor and it feels a bit more intimate than other restaurants.  I'd say it's a good place for a romantic dinner if the location is convenient for you.  My spouse and I shared three dishes and my favorite was the Wonton Crusted Prawns.  The sauces had some kick.  The Crab Cakes were good too but a bit pricey for what was served.  The Sauerbraten Poutine was really filling and decent, although I thought the beef was a tad dry.  Also, there were giant curds that weren't melted, so we had to mix up the fries and bury the curds before we dove into it.   The service was average.  Our party did get a hard time because we had tables reserved that didn't get used immediately.  I wasn't impressed at how this was handled and even though we eventually gave up some space, the staff could have been nicer about it.  It put a temporary damper on the birthday girl's mood.    Truthfully, there isn't anything about Tango that stands out enough for me to return.  I'm happy to have tried it once, just to satisfy my curiosity."}
{"text":"My sister and her husband LOVE this place.  They go here a ton because they love ordering lots of things and sharing.  I decided to bring a date here because what better way to suss out a potential partner, then trying to navigate a menu together right?    First, the good.  YOU CAN BRING YOUR OWN WINE.  I was super classy and pulled a sweet bottle of Menege a Trois out of my purse which we enjoyed for only $12 corkage.  This is huge and accounts for approximately 2.7 of the 3 star rating.  The ambiance is great for a date.  Nice lighting, cozy booths, professional service.  The food is ok.  I'd prefer them to offer fewer items but knock them out of the park.  We had:  Bacon wrapped beef tenderloin - good, but not great (sigh...) Moroccan tangine - nothing special... Pear & blackberry salad - meh Gnocchi - had high expectations for this bad boy but....pretty average  At this point you're probably thinking the date was doomed given the lackluster food.  Well, great news - I didn't feel like dessert but my date was a genius and ordered TWO desserts so we went home full and then put on stretchy pants to rub our stomachs.    Bottom line: Nothing says love like wine and dessert."}
{"text":"Excellent place!! Every thing here is just great!!! All tapas we have tried are delicious! If you like fish: I recommend The tuna and the scallops... I also tried the egg rolls and they were delicious! The chorizo sliders and the risotto were great too!!  In addition the wine in this place is very good too and the service veery friendly! They were not super fast last time I went; not super slow either... But my best recommendation is not going in a rush ...   In summary, I think this place is totally worthy to try!!"}
{"text":"This place had the most amazing staff. We came in for cocktails, which were wonderful and reasonable, cause we had a flat tire. In the end a good bit after closing, when the tow truck never came, the manager helped us change the tire. They totally restored my faith in humanity, the food looked and smelled amazing. I can't wait to come for dinner"}
{"text":"Funky vibe super fresh food really knowledgeable staff. Pricey so make sure someone else is paying lol.  But the food is absolutely worth the price.  Wide array of wines, fresh food and innovative crafting of old and new dishes"}
{"text":"I was struggling to decide whether Tango Bistro is a joke or an insult... and finally settled on an insult, though a neat one.  Seriously, look: Four thin round slices of baguette from nearby superstore, slightly roasted, covered with salad leaves and a hint of ground beef for 10+ dollars a portion, plus tax? Smells like ROI and tastes like a profit margin to me. Delicious!  I mean, when you order something that costs ten bucks a plate, can you honestly hold your laugh looking at two toothpicks protruding a coin-size fraction of cow meat, wrapped in a shade of bacon? And that stuff is called something like \"steak\" in their menu?  Nah, can't be a joke, it's a smart insult. Kinda, you snob, you can pay whatever for a tiny-mini piece of food called a \"plate to share\" and still keep your face serious, like you understand something the rest of us humans don't.  People like that deserve to be charged well, I can only applause the owner of Tango Bistro for an excellent business model.  Still wanna give it a try, my dear hipster? Come on, eh!"}
{"text":"Yum, amazing food, amazing service, Sunday is the best day to go as they have a 3 course special. Perfect for a date away from the kids. The dining room is intimate and cozy."}
