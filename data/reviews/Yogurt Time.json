{"text":"Friendly, helpful employees.  Awesome selection of flavors. I was there on a Sunday evening. They have a nice area in the back by the lake to sit & enjoy your yogurt. It was a good experience."}
{"text":"Yogurt is great but the employee was playing the gangsta rap station- specifically \"I Don't Give a F---\" by E40.  This was with kids coming in afterschool.  I asked the station be changed and employee went straight to another rap channel before settling on country.  Not a family friendly place, especially compared to many other yogurt places nearby."}
{"text":"I like this place. I don't see why they're not as busy as Yogurt Land. Both are in good locations. I prefer a lake view here versus other places. A lot more popper flavors than other yogurt places. Nice and clean!"}
{"text":"About 10 flavor choices including 2 tart. Tasting cups are available at the entrance. Didn't taste them all but those I did taste were good.  Odd combo choices other than dutch chocolate/vanilla bean. (Maybe someone would want peach/watermelon or cinnamon bun/cookies & cream but they didn't appeal to me.) Lots of toppings but only selected two. Coconut was very dried out and just as crunchy as the almonds.   Cost per ounce (.79) isn't prominently displayed anywhere so had to ask. Employee was very pleasant but I also had to request my receipt for a debit card sale. Lakeside seating is nice and store was very clean."}
{"text":"Terrible selection of flavors-three chocolates, three tarts, Cinnabon and a coffee flavor. They have cheap generic toppings that have no flavor and not sure if they are trying to be a yogurt \"club\" but the strobe light colors is a bit much!"}
{"text":"Good tasting frozen yogurt. Good selection of toppings.  Friendly employee, tables by the lake to enjoy your yogurt outside, TVs and iPads for the customers to use."}
{"text":"I like this place. I might be a tad swayed though because it's only about 4 or 5 miles from my house.   A few things I like are: -Lakeside view seating outside  -Various board games in the back of the shop. (Had a good time playing \"Friend's Trivia\" while sitting outside and enjoying the view). -Had really great customer service from a young gent the first few times -They offer rewards if you give them your phone number. I've already gotten a 20% off coupon and it's only been a few times that I've visited  Some things that knocked the additional stars off of the review: -Have visited this place maybe 3 or 4 times within the past 2-3 months and only one yogurt flavor changed.. so, the variety is kind of \"meh\" -Customer service hasn't really matched the first few times. Seems there is a younger gal working there lately and she seems almost annoyed when you get to the register. I had to prompt her to ask for my phone number for the reward points because she doesn't ask! Super disappointing!  All in all, it's a pretty nice place if you're okay with the aforementioned details"}
{"text":"My experience here was great. After eating lunch next door, my friends and I stopped by to grab some frozen yogurt for dessert earlier today. There were so many flavors - cinnamon bun, pumpkin, watermelon, oreos, peanut butter, salted caramel popcorn, cake batter, vanilla, chocolate, etc. There were also so many toppings to choose from - the most I've ever seen at any frozen yogurt joint - so I was impressed.  There were so many of those popping bubbles; I've only tasted strawberry and mango really, so I was having a great time.  There are three tvs, board games, a lake in the back of the shop. No wi-fi. Seating is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Worst yogurt experience , two out of the six yogurts were extremely sour, candies also tasted stale. Both girls, one which was new were very unfriendly and the one was wearing a very short dress and bent over in front of me and my family and you could clearly see her entire rear end.it was extremely unprofessional and inappropriate for a family friendly."}
{"text":"The customer service here is wonderful and it makes for such a pleasant experience. I love their boba milk teas and fruit smoothies, and of course their frozen yogurt flavor are delicious! I think the customer service is what gives Yogurt Time it's edge over other froyo places. This place is a gem! One of my favorite little spots when I need a boost or just in the mood for a fruity drink :)"}
