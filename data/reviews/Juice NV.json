{"text":"Not sure why it's so expensive here.

The smoothie was good but $10 for a 12 or 16 oz is a little bit unreasonable.  The ingredients aren't organic. 

 At Wholefoods you could get a better selection/quality/quantity for the same price.

Still don't get why it's so expensive here...."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, $10+ for a 16 oz cup of organic fruit and veggies juice is just way too much.  I don't care if the juice is cold, hot or lukewarm pressed.  There is just no way on this earth that the amount of produce in the cup equates to that price (even with a Green Valley/Henderson markup).  

Food choices were equally expensive."}
{"text":"A cure everything... Energy, hangover, weight loss, hangover, post workout , and my Hangover!"}
{"text":"$11 for a bottled juice.  This is why it's hard to stay healthy in the U.S.  I just moved here from LA I've never seen this price before and was very surprised to see it here.  The juice is good but the price is probably the reason I won't be coming in as often as I used to at my local juice shop in LA :("}
{"text":"I'm so jealous that this is in Henderson, not only are the juices all yummy but very affordable compared to others in town. Can't wait to try the food items."}
{"text":"Try their salads and their kale chips. Gives you enough proteins that you're not hungry the entire day. Their smoothies are excellent during the summer. What a way to cool off"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Juice NV since I juice at home.  I expected the juice to be made once ordered, but apparently they juice the morning of and bottle it. I was shocked they put it in plastic bottles because of the loss of nutrients and potential toxins now in the juice. The second shock was the price. $10.99 +tax?! Wow! That's overpriced. I got the Juice NV, which I really liked, but I can't see paying $11.00 for a juice made hours prior and put into a plastic bottle. 
The one staff person was very friendly and again, liked the juice. Just can't see spending the dollars they're asking for...too bad as I like to support small, local businesses."}
{"text":"I tried the Pomegranate smoothie, and it was really good for a pure fruit smoothie. Like some of the other reviewers mentioned they are pricey. $11+ tax and the size they give you is maybe equivalent to a grande iced latte at Starbucks. Also decided to try the tuna sandwich, which was just ok, for the price I felt like I could have gotten more somewhere else. 1 smoothie, 2 sandwiches, 1 salad came out to about $40. Also was expecting somewhere to sit and eat, but no indoor or outdoor options. The staff was very friendly, and the location very well presented and clean!"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place other than they have one of the best juices in town.

I am partial to Unicorn Blood so I just run in and grab it and go.

It's cold pressed, super fresh and yummy.

High end at 10 bucks for a plastic bottle...I still think it's in my top two favs of cold pressed in Vegas!

Short and sweet, that's my love affair with Unicorn Blood."}
{"text":"I love the product they have, no doubt about that. But I am tired of the lack of stock of juices because I drive across town and get there and they are out. I drove across town to get there before they close at 8pm. But when I get there at 640pm they were closed?. That did not make me happy, wasted trip, time, and fuel. There are on occasion I get a employee that is snotty and I don't feel wanted. I want to spend my money, but hard to with this kind of business how it's run."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Freshly squeezed, cold pressed as well as great combinations of juices THIS IS IT!! My favorite is the Orange Ginger. The price is comparable to what this type and quality of juice goes for anywhere else. NOTE: there are really good special deals (like get two for the price of one on juices with that days date on them) after 3 or 3:30pm! Their manager who has come specially to set this store up and ensure it is running well is awesome!"}
{"text":"I got there at 4:40pm and their new \"winter\" hours say they are open until 5:00pm and doors were locked. Knocked on the door and they eventually opened. I drove a distance and was refusing to drive home empty handed.
I wanted to purchase a cleanse and the woman who helped me was very short and dry. I think she was wanting to leave home because she already had her jacket on. She let me know that they did not have the juices I need and then began to supplement with other juices. 
I let her know I want to do 2 days worth of cleansing and she said she did not have enough juices. When I said I would come back the next day she said  there will not be any. I asked if there will be in the other location and she said no. Not very helpful and began to say \"they will be closing for the holidays\" and did not explain what that meant. Not very helpful AT ALL!"}
{"text":"Soooo I have been extremely excited to give this place a try ! It's unfortunate that I do not think I will be returning for the juice however the walnut tuna sandwich was absolutely delicious ! My only complaint is the price of the juice . $10 !!! $10 !!! For 16oz ?! I'm not a cheap person but if that's not taking advantage I don't know what is . My advice save your money, buy a juicer for your home then go to whole foods or trader joes and buy $10 worth of organic fruits & veggies. I promise it'll make you more that 16oz !"}
{"text":"So I didn't realize this a cold-pressed juice place im not sure exactly what that means but all their juices are pressed and bottled in the morning so you can't customize your juice like at other juice bars. And their juices are $10.99 so expensive! So I had to get the miniature 8oz juice that was still $4.99. That being said it was really really delicious I got the carrot parsley spinach celery juice, it was so refreshing and the perfect amount of sweet from the carrots. Tasted like high quality juice just way outta my price range."}
{"text":"I was excited for this place to open and finally made it in shortly after the grand opening. Was it just an \"off day\" for their employees? High prices aside, I was more disappointed that the gentleman behind the counter seemed less than enthused to assist. I finally settled on getting a bottle of Unicorn's Blood and left with an overall feeling of \"meh.\" I'd be more inclined to come back if I felt like my business was even slightly valued."}
{"text":"I ordered the unicorns blood juice which was very fresh and taste amazing! Jen was working at the register and was very helpful. The atmosphere was very clean and they have great artwork around the store. My favorite part was the chalkboard where they have a new quote written each day!"}
{"text":"I like to get cold press juices a lot and the Green Mary has to be one of the healthiest I've had. After drinking one you know you're doing the right thing. The place is exactly what you expect when going to a top quality juice store. Everything is fresh. Store is beautiful and the staff is knowledgable and will even give you a taste if you want to try one of the juices. I recommend this spot even if you're not into the super green drinks  like I am. They even have juices my 5 year old niece loved."}
{"text":"I love this concept! Coupled with their friendly and knowledgeable staff, this is a terrific place with tons of healthy options! Their chia seed pudding is excellent as are all of the juices I have tried (which is most). The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because I wish they had an incentive program with their juice bottles and/or offered a discount when you bought a certain amount of products. Overall I am a huge fan."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Took the time to answer all of my questions. When they offered me and my group samples of everything that put them over the top"}
{"text":"All the juices here are amazing! They taste delicious and the place is a cool spot to hangout, study or work on your laptop.. I tried the pesto Avocado sandwich and the Green Mary.... perfect healthy lunch... I will definitely be making this my juice spot in Las Vegas. If your a juice lover like me you will love this place (-: thank you Juice NV for coming to Vegas we needed you !!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really torn writing this review.

The pro's:
-The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. I have no clue what I'm doing here, so they guided me through the whole experience. They were so patient as I basically was a deer in headlights.
-The juice was really good. I wish I could remember what this was supposed to do for my body, but I'm not really all that healthy. When it's this tasty, it makes a girl give her diet a second look.
-While I don't juice, I eat organic as much as I can. I take herbal supplements and will find a way to treat any illness with a natural cure if possible. That's the extent of my ode to a healthy life. Other than that, pass me a double cheeseburger. But again when, it's this good, it makes me want to at least juice in the morning.

Con's:
-It was pre-made in a bottle. I get it. From a time and efficiency standpoint, it makes complete sense, but I would rather watch it being made or else why not pick this up at Whole Foods. I get the shelf life and freshness piece, but do I really need to go to a storefront for only this one item and it's pre-made? Kind of disappointing.
-$10 a bottle. I know I get what I pay for. I'm sure it takes time to create plus clean up. I'm sure it's pounds of produce, and they have to pay everyone and all of the overhead.... But $10 a bottle is high for me to grab everyday. Let's say you went most days (5-6 days a week) that would be adding about $3000 to your yearly budget on juice alone. Crazy. Goodbye, Kilimanjaro trip.
-There's no real seating area. Take the juice, sandwich, salad and go. I like to eat what I buy right away, so I drank my juice and ate my food off of the hood of my car in the parking lot. It basically makes this place a very health convenience store. An expensive, healthy convenience store. Like a healthy, upscale 7-11 that only sells their own product.

So three stars it is because I do like the juice and the staff, but the pre-made juice at $10/bottle with no seating is something I can't quite wrap my head around."}
{"text":"This place is not for me... But if you're into super foods or enjoy weird tasting drinks then this is the place to go. Wish I had enjoyed it but it gave me a stomach ache probably the worse one I've ever had. Girlfriend liked her drink so that's always good therefore 2 stars"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I love getting a ginger - turmeric - lemon - cayenne shots to combat cold/flu season.  The \"Green Mary\" has been a life saver for me while I am on a 6 week weight loss challenge.  I have tried a few things on the menu and everything has been delicious.  Great for health minded people."}
{"text":"If you are craving a fresh squeezed juice this is not the place. Comes in a plastic bottle! They  pre juice it. As you know fresh juice loses its potency the longer it sits around, especially in a plastic bottle. Ok, the place says they open at 7am but I got there at 8 and the doors were locked. From the outside it looks closed with dark windows and no appeal. When you walk in, it's clean but the women behind the counter talks to you like this is the biggest thing to hit Vegas, lol, it's juice in a plastic bottle no matter how you try and explain it to me. I am from LA and been juicing for 20 years. The juices start at 9.99 a bottle and go up. I do not mind paying the money but I better see you extracting right into my cup! 1 star for cleanliness and mediocre juicing. Whole foods, here I come!!"}
{"text":"There are not enough places in Las Vegas that offer healthy options and good tasting food. If this place was closer to my house I would probably go 3-4 times a week. If you want to eat healthy but not sacrificing tastiness then you should check this place out."}
{"text":"I went to Juice NV hoping for some FRESH pressed juice. Instead found pre-bottled cold pressed juice. I like to customize my juice, but they didn't even have ingredients on stand-by to juice what I ideally wanted. My boyfriend asked for simple carrot juice but they could not fulfill his wishes. The service was enjoyable, and the place was completely dead so we were in and out quickly. Won't be stopping here again. I'll just stick with my fresh juice from Whole Foods."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open, but when I left I was really disappointed. I spent 42.00 on a smoothie, 2 drinks and truffles. The smoothie was delicious. The truffles were absolutely horrible. Then I got two drinks the unicorns blood and a green one and they are absolutely disgusting I and so disappointed because they were way over priced but I chose to try them anyway. The staff was extremely wonderful and helpful while I was there. It is the drinks and dessert I disliked."}
{"text":"Rating based on pricing for quality.  WAY. TOO. EXPENSIVE. . Other than that, no comment."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite cold pressed juice store. Not only do they have fantastic juices they also have delicious shakes and sandwiches. They also sell juiced at 50% off if you buy one on the date printed on bottle"}
{"text":"So I follow a couple club promoters from Hakkasan and that's how I ended going to this place. I'm all about fitness and being healthy so why not give it a try. First impression of this place was thAt it looked nice and clean. Staff were great and even wanted my girlfriend to take a pic of her baby and enter it in there contest. As for the juices, I thought they tasted good, only thing I dislikes was not watching it get made, instead we got it in a bottle. One huge disappointment was that we did not win the picture contest, instead they gave it to some hot model who is probably friend with some club promoter or something. I thought it was completely unfair, everywhere I go I always win there pic contest, and if I lose it's always to a good photo, but seriously this photo was a black and white of some model with a lot of followers. For that reason I will not be going to this place anymore."}
{"text":"I make an effort to come here at least once a week for my compulsory juice fix.  I've had many cold pressed juices from numerous companies but this place by far takes the lead. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. I would suggest going for the 'green mary' juice If you're really looking for that juice uplift. The food is  great there too, especially the tuna sandwich. Can't wait to see more of these stores across Vegas."}
{"text":"I stopped by at 8:45 AM on 7/22/15 and the employee was just getting started, the only thing they had was pre bottled juices - so - not coming back - I can buy bottled juices at WholeFoods for probably much less. Review you REAL opening hours please 8 AM really?"}
{"text":"Love this place I live in sunmerlin and drive all the way to Henderson to get the unicorn blood so good! And after 3 or 4 the drinks marked that date are half off love it! ... The owner is really nice also give it a try"}
{"text":"Overall this place is delicious. The atmosphere too is very warm and welcoming. The avocado sandwich is a must as well by far one of my favorite things to eat. I come here once week and I definitely recommend it to all my health nuts or people looking to start eating right."}
{"text":"I've always passed by this place, but never had the time to stop by.  Finally had the chance to try this place out and I love it!  The avocado pesto sandwich is delicious."}
{"text":"I had been waiting for this place to open, but I'm am pretty disappointed. The prices seem outrageous. $10 for a juice? We went in on the first day, I expected there may be some disorganization due to being brand new, but everything seemed to be in order. There was at least 3 employees behind the counter. 

The staff was very nice. While we were looking over the menu one of the girls came over to us. She wanted to answer any questions we might of had, but honestly both of us were kind of surprised at the $10 per juice thing. We couldn't really get past it. 

Another group walked in, and back out again while we were there. After checking the menu out for a bit, we decided to leave and go across the street to our old standby. Prices were far more reasonable at The Protein House, so I think we'll stick with them and Greens & Proteins. The juice price here is higher than Whole Foods prices. That's Crazy!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas' first urban farm stand.

Went to pick up the car rental and this was next door and my brother wanted to check it out.  The first wall I looked up at, there were unique names to products I was unsure of.  I read \"green finger\" thinking it was some kind of chicken finger.  It was a smoothie. What popped out the most on the menu board is the price.  I thought it was ridiculously expensive.  But hey, what the hell, try it.  

After reading the different ingredients to each smoothie, I went with one I was familiar with.  Almond milk, strawberries, bananas, vanilla, coconut oil, sea salt and ice.  I went with the Almond Delight.  It was definitely a delight.  Tasty.  My brother ordered the Pineapple Jungle which was good but I wasn't sure about one of the ingredients, bee pollen.  

Because of the prices, I told myself I wouldn't come back unless it was something I hadn't had in a long time.  Well...it happened sooner than I thought.  Returned the car a couple days later and we just had to stop by and try it again.  So good, convenient, but extremely pricy.

What I had, I thought was delish!

{"text":"I cannot speak about the bottled juice, but the acai bowl is terrible. Actually more like a juice, not even a smoothie. Served in a cup, 3/4 way full, with a spoon. No spoon needed, I drank it. Ripoff. Need to learn how a \"bowl\" is made and served from Protein House across the street or Acai To The T in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Their staff are all so friendly and helpful. They are very eager to help you and answer any questions you might have. 
I am not a frequent juicer because it is just too much work to juice at home... the preparation and clean up is just too much for me to justify. Which is why I love that juicerys are finally opening up in Vegas.

The prices here are reasonable...around 10$ a juice with a ton of options for you to choose from. Unicorn's Blood is delicious! I see a lot of people have an issue with the fact that they bottle their juices, but I actually love that. I am there to grab what I need and go. If I wanted to watch a my juice be made in front of me, I'd do it at home. 

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a great experience is was coming to this juice store. From the minute walking in the door the girl behind the counter was extremely friendly and out going. I was unsure on what to order so she offered me several different varieties in both juices and the sandwiches. I chose the green Mary drink and the avocado sandwich. Both of which were delicious and extremely filling. In my opinion if you are going to enjoy a sandwich chose the other green drink, not the green Mary.... It's a meal within itself."}
{"text":"$11.00 for a smoothie is absolutely outrageous.  That is pure arrogance and unrealistic.  This fruit must have been picked by white people!"}
{"text":"This is a good place is you're looking for cold pressed veggie and fruit juices. Located in the cluster-f of Eastern in the shopping center as BJ's and Big 5, it's a clean and modern place with a walk refrigerator full of juices pressed I am guessing earlier in the day. They offer little shot samples which is nice should you be indecisive about what it is you want. 
The day I went my younger daughter and I sampled the Carrot-Apple-ginger ( yum), the romaine-celery-ginger-lemon (I drink a green drink daily so I liked this, however non green drinkers may not appreciate its salady taste, I picked this one), and I think the watermelon-pineapple (which is what my daughter ended up getting, fruity and refreshing). The total was around $21.00
I think they are organic if I remember correctly which is nice, I juice/vitamix daily so $10 a juice is pricey for me, but in a pinch this place is s good choice."}
{"text":"Very nice store with cool artwork. The employee Jen that worked there was very polite and helpful when I was kind of lost on what to drink. She went out of her way to explain all the different options of juice and food. I ended up getting the avocado sandwich (was amazing) and a green juice that made me full of energy. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I'm note a default here and stop daily.  It's pricey but I believe my health is worth it.  Note:  they will be coming out with punch cards so you can earn free juices."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Saturday morning. I'm always down for trying a new juice place, but this place failed to wow, but we have limited juice options here in henderson:

This shop has really limited options. I was bummed because they didn't offer any samples and I probably would have bought more but I just didn't want to load up and not like them. 

What I liked best was that they had a juice without an apple in it. (Tip, since Apple is cheap juice places will often use Apple to fill up the container) but this place has one without it. 

We tried the complete greens and I really liked it! (5/5)."}
{"text":"First visit to Juice NV and it was amazing.  Being our first visit, the girl behind the counter not only informed us all about the juice and process, but gave us a taste of all the juices they have and I have to tell you, the juice they make there are some of the best I have ever had.  

They use a cold press to make the juice which captures more nutrients then a regular juicer and almost all were really amazing.  They have juices I have never seen anywhere before and the taste was really good.  

Another amazing thing about this place is they not only make the juice fresh to order, but they also make up several small bottles of their juices for sale which you can take home and have about a 3 day supply, REALLY?

I have not seen this anywhere else.  They do have a small selection of fresh foods as well, but being new they are working on putting together a to go menu.

I highly recommend this place if you are into juices, you will not be disappointed unless you don't go...."}
{"text":"Great concepts, especially for Las Vegas.  I was so excited to see a new juice place, but I can't say that what I had was amazing.  The balance was off on the green juice... too much parsley.  I couldn't finish it.  

I juice almost daily and tend to keep it quite green without adding apples or too many fruits.  I'm fine with the green flavors, which can be hard to get used to.  But this one wasn't good.  I felt like I was plugging my noise to get it down. 

I loved that it is organic.  However, the prices were too high.  Juices average $10-11.  Most places with these prices have a system where you can recycle their containers for $1-2 off on the next juice.  I might have missed it, but I didn't see this option there. 

I understand the idea that there are no amendments to their juices because its their recipe and juices aren't made to order, but it was difficult to get that concept with just their menus.  Several places outside of Vegas do this, but It took a little time to understand their way of business. They were friendly about answering my questions, but its not clearly explained on the menu or in the store.

I am not quite sold on this place yet, but I'm curious to come back.  The food menu didn't entice me, but I would like to try their smoothies."}
{"text":"TOO many people these days just want to complain! Yes, their juice is pricy. If you have ever eaten an all organic diet, then you would understand. I moved to NV from CA and THANK GOD for Juice NV!! I have never had a bad experience. My favorites right now are Pretty Woman, Enlightened, and Scam Artist. They also offer a beginner and advanced juice detox. So perfect for before and after the holidays!! I know it's crazy to order smoothies in the winter, but they're AMAZING!  Robbie & Haley are slowly becoming my new favorite people! Thanks guys, see ya next week!!"}
{"text":"I love new businesses and learning new things!

I try to juice at home, but get lazy and this place was great. I'm still new to the trend and the staff was very informative and so nice! I have no prices to compare with this, but juices range from $10-$12 a juice depending on what you get. Plus, I can try new juice combinations without making it in bulk. They have a huge range of juices and smoothies to choose from!

You can buy a single juice, smoothies and veggie/vegan food options. You can also buy a days worth of a juice cleanse (I can't remember if they come with 5 or 6 varieties of juice).

Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Very pricey. My visit met with some items on menu not available and they were out of 16oz cups so I was handed two 8oz bottles at $5 each.  Not a convenient location as parking lot is a pain to navigate with the dozens of businesses in this center. Doubt I'll be back...mark me as disappointed. Fresh & Easy and other juice bars are half the price."}
{"text":"I love love this place!!! Is a definite must try if you're looking for great juice & fresh food. The Acai bowl is the best around, and my favorite is the green mary to drink. Best part about this place is the friendly staff that always has a smile! Absolutely the best place for juice in vegas hands down!!"}
{"text":"Their drinks are great and we love the fact that they have a RTD when you're in a hurry or just dont have any patience at all. Their hand crafted beverage is on point, you definitely won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The juices are all amazing, as they offer samples of all they have to offer...but my favorite is hands down the green with nv. Not to mention the service is awesome, which I find hard to come by these days. I also feel it's important to mention the juices are fresh squeezed, cold pressed, and organic, as it seems many people appear to have an issue with pricing. My suggestion to you is to go purchase all the organic fruits and vegetables necessary to make a 16 oz glass of juice, and I can promise you that you'll spend at least $20. Yes, you'll be able to make a glass or two...but you'll also have to prep and clean up. So keep in mind you're also paying for the convenience of not having to do either of the two. The bottom line, this is a great establishment and I couldn't be happier that it happens to be right up the street from me. I'll be back whenever I don't feel like doing all the work myself, or simply to get out of the house. After all, the decor and outdoor seating is a winner as well!!!"}
