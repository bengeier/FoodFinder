{"text":"Good selection of beverages, and a damn good happy hour menu too! I enjoy the food a lot and the staff is always friendly, accommodating, and helpful!"}
{"text":"Awesome food - they must have a REAL chef working in this place. The turkey tacos are absolutely amazing!  The staff was really knowledgeable and pushed us to expand our beer horizons."}
{"text":"I love this place. I come in at least once a week. Scott is probably the most genuinely friendly and totally chill bartender ever!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Been meeting friends here regularly for the past 2 years. Great food, I recommend the turkey bacon enchiladas. Additionally, the beer selection is THE BOMB! Great rotating beers on tap. You will never go thirsty here. The outdoor patio is on point too. Good spot for a casual date or hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Gluten free accomodating! Neat place, like the decor, but I was most impressed that they serve gluten free bread or buns as an option. Usually I can't find much to eat at pub restaurants, but I enjoyed a turkey sandwich on a gluten free bun and they had a cider beer on tap. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Nice place, good service, awesome patio This place had decent bar food and I liked their beer selection, both times I went the staff has been very nice and provided fast service, All in all it's worth a visit"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE this place!!! Honestly one of the reasons I keep coming to Spoke's is because one of the servers, Madison, is such so sweet and a great worker! She always makes sure we're enjoying everything, and I've never had a problem when she's been our server! Recommend 10/10!"}
{"text":"The beers were warm and flat.  The bartender was argumentative when we told him about it.  6 employees working on a Sunday afternoon and I still had to get up and go to the bar to get napkins for my wings since none were brought to me with them.  The place is cold and not inviting at all.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent place to watch the  Cardinals and football!! The food and service was spot on. Burgers will yummy"}
{"text":"What an amazing vibe!  Today was my first visit to Spokes on Southern and I will definitely be heading back soon! I waltz in on a Wednesday night and the Bartender David  gave this place the best first impression. He remembered my name right of the bat which is not as typical as it should be at similar establishments. Very friendly, personable and hilarious  throughout my entire visit. Also  he noticeably respected when to stop let you enjoy your drink very diligently .   I was not there for Happy Hour but will be returning to take advantage of it soon. drinks look fair and have great food options. The beer was very great but all my compliments have to again to the bartender, David.   I am constantly disappointed by other bars and restaurants because their staff cannot make a near decent 'Old Fashioned' spirit.  I must be honest and say that Spokes' bartender made the absolute best 'Old Fashion' since my very first. It is amazing that they have this type of talent on staff.  The food I had was also very enjoyable.   Overall vibe was very positive, chill and friendly. I look forward to the summer because it looks like they have a great patio.  Probably the best first impression of a new restaurant that I have had in quite some time. Fair Prices and amazing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yikes! We ordered well done wings and they came out rubbery so we reordered.  One of meals came out about 7 minutes before the rest of ours and the wings still hadn't arrived from reordering. Finally the waiter came back and said he didn't know what the delay was on the wings so he took them off the bill and he would still bring them to us if they cooked them.  The waiter was nice about the issues but it doesn't dismiss the major issues with the kitchen. Our other three meals arrived and two out of three burgers were under cooked, seriously under cooked. The manager ended up coming out and we told him about the burgers being undercooked and he did offer to take half the cost off, which was nice but still very frustrating. The wings came out and they looked exactly the same as the first time, nice and rubbery.  We tried to try and salvage the meal so we decided to order dessert, a house made brownie and salted caramel cheesecake, however, after placing the order, we were told they were out of two out of four of the desserts they offer. Really??? I'm done, we won't be back!"}
{"text":"We waited 1 hour for our food, had no refills on drinks and asked for our food to be boxed up and it took 20 minutes to do that. I can usually understand when the restaurant is busy. But there were two other tables in the restaurant. No manager spoke to us. Another table was asking where the heck their food was when we were trying to get our bill. We will not be having any lunches there ever again."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers! Not good, but fantastic. The menu is avante-garde and a sports at to boot. Definitely try the jukebox app! Am going back again today to try the stuffed Pasillia!"}
{"text":"Easily the best bar in tempe. Awesome beer and great service. Their bartender Matt gives the best beer recommendations and server Justin is always on point checking in even when they're super busy. This place never disappoints"}
{"text":"Their waffle fries are great!! However...if you are a true shrimp taco lover, such as myself, do not order the shrimp tacos... Its basically a little shrimp mixed with lettuce ( used as a filler..nasty) and a corn/flour tortilla. My bf says the b.y.o.burger  is aweome and the BEER selection is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time 8/26/15 with a group of people.  I waited 10-15 min for a waiter to come by to take orders(who didn't bring more menus...). I got a seltzer water to drink and it mildly tasted like tap water/dirt. I had been there once before, but did not order any food.This time, I asked for the Veg Head Sandwich (Grilled portobello, red peppers, fresh basil, sliced tomato, and fresh mozzarella) with extra of the balsamic sauce, a gluten free bun, and sweet potato fries. It took at least 30 min for my food to come out (conveniently when I went to wash my hands), and noticed I had waffle fries instead of sweet potato ones. I nibbled on the rest of my food, waiting for the waiter to come around to get the right fries, but it never happened before I finished the whole sandwich. The sandwich was lukewarm (so much for fresh grilled portobello) and did not have extra sauce. I waited a long time for a barely heated sandwich. The gluten free bun was crumbly and rather tasteless, which I know it's not their fault, but I should warn anyone wanting to try it. Really, the whole sandwich was pretty bland, even though it should have been awesome with the ingredients used. Now that I think about it, I don't believe there were red peppers on the sandwich. It took 20+ mins after I finished eating to ask for a check from the waiter. I know we had a decent size group, but the place was nearly deserted other wise besides another group outside and maybe 2-3 people inside at the bar. The waiter was MIA so much, I wondered what he was even doing since the place was not busy at all, being a week night.  So, if you like to pay too much for bland food and poor service, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times it was awesome. The first time I was there for happy hour, but decided to get the salmon BLT with sweet potato fries and I think it was a great decision. For $10 or so you get a nice piece of salmon in the sandwich and most likely you will have to take half home. This place also has about 24 beers on tap to chose from including sour beer! I love sour beer but it's sometimes hard to find it on tap, and this place had 3 different kinds! Second time was also during happy hour, and I decided to try the turkey sliders for $3.99. They were good but had a very strong curry slaw on top of it so if you don't like curry you won't like the sliders.   Happy hour goes until 7pm which is nice and they also have a reverse happy hour starting at 10pm."}
{"text":"Great place what a surprise!! Went there after a hash run and met up with my daughter hoping she would like it too. Great decor and the wait staff were right on and we came in full force with 60 plus people on a sat night just showing up.  Excellent beer choices wish I didn't live so far away I would have sampled many more of their great list of beers on tap.They even have the alcohol content listed so no guessing what or how hard it'll hit you-BRAVO!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday. Plus was happy hour all day and good beer list. Minus was service (slow) and food was mediocre at best. This place is fine for good drink but choose elsewhere to squander calories."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a wide selection of beers! I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but was happy with what I've ordered so far. Outside seating next to a small pond is a huge plus. Definitely will be back soon"}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection, very interesting menu (the Poblano was incredible), tasty food, and great atmosphere.  The service was good, not great.  Waited too long for drinks each time we ordered them and part of our food order was delivered to another table (which they enjoyed while we waited for our server to re-order).  This was a Sunday and the restaurant was very busy, so I will still give it 5 stars.  Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We went in around lunchtime on a Saturday, it wasn't that busy, and everyone on the staff was super friendly.  Our server was funny and helpful.  My fiancé and I both got the Carver burger and I got the stuffed poblano pepper as my side.  The burger was great but the poblano pepper was the star of the whole visit - delicious!  I could eat a whole plate of just those!  They have Golden Tee and Buck Hunter, as well as a couch area with some board games.  They do trivia on Monday nights, too. We are already planning on coming back just to hang out, play games, and try some drinks from their good variety of draft beers.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, love the patio. Service was decent, but not phenomenal. Food wasn't bad, except you could tell the food was previously frozen. If I'm paying 9 dollars for a chicken finger basket, the chicken shouldn't be tough. I think this would be a great drinking spot, they had a lot of good beers on tap and a nice patio. But only get the food if you have the drunk munchies!"}
{"text":"Good lord its hard to be THAT BAD, the food is terrible. Cold, uncooked fries every single time its just disgusting. Never bringing my family back here!"}
{"text":"Pros: Nice patio.  Good beer selection.  Tasty veggie tacos (with corn tortillas). Nice server.   Cons: Sweet potato fries were more mushy than crispy. Black beans were undercooked.  Hummus was mediocre."}
{"text":"I always love coming to Spokes. The food is always great and the service is even better. Especially when Tessa Owens is my waitress!"}
{"text":"Lindsey was the best bar tender ever. The prices are fair, and the customer service was great!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this restaurant! Their food and beer are fantastic and the staff is super friendly. I wish they had one in East Mesa. I love that it's not overly crowded and we can enjoy a nice lunch or dinner every once in awhile without waiting forever."}
{"text":"Spokes on Southern is my go to any time I am in Tempe because I absolutely love this spot. The atmosphere is relaxing whether inside or out, the food selection is varied, and the beer selection is numerous. Plus, they more than welcome four legged friends on their patio.   The major draw that keeps me coming back to Spokes is the revolving beer selection. They've always got 25+ beers on tap and the taps change monthly. Always on tap are the typical staples you'd expect, but rotating are varied selections from local breweries or craft micro brews from across the nation. I've discovered many new brews here and I appreciate their dedication to keeping the tap offerings fresh and exciting.  While nothing spectacular or out of this world; the food is fairly priced and quite good. They boast of sourcing fresh local ingrediants for all their menu offerings and nothing has led me to believe that is not the case. I'd liken the menu to stuff you'd easily whip up in your own kitchen (assuming you were culinarily inclined) and would enjoy eating. I've enjoyed most items on their menu including their brunch offerings and havn't had a single complaint about anything I've tried. A good restuarant should keep their menu short and to the point which Spokes does and does it well in my opinion. Nothing worse than when a menu is all over the place with too many different dishes.  Service is warm and friendly. Of the numerous times I have visited Spokes I have never left feeling unappreciated as a customer. Staff is attentive and more than willing to answer any questions and provide quick small samples of any beer I'm curious of trying before commiting to purchasing an entire pint.  I'll continue to be a patron at Spokes any time I find myself in Arizona."}
{"text":"I have lived in Tempe for many years,  and throughout that time Spokes had and will be one of my favorite bars and restaurants that embodies a great Tempe bar. Great tap list, updated and amazing menu. The chillest vide in Tempe.  The staff is fast, nice and know everything they need to know to treat you right.  My wife and I also love this place because it is very child friendly during the day.  Great place for all types of occasions.  Aw"}
{"text":"The food is always great but tonight changed my mind about the food and the customer service here.  Every time I called the phone line sounded busy and when I finally was able to get threw SHAWN answered the phone very rudely saying \" stop calling\". The phone was having technical difficulties I asked him can I place an order online since I can't really hear him and he said \"no!\" And hung up. Coming to find out you actually can! So I drove 15 miles to get there and the door is covered in stickers saying I can order online!!Are you serious?!? I go in to order and he gave me attitude and I asked how long my food would take and he rolled his eyes and was like 10-15 minuets.  I finally got my food and it was cold and the wings were super dry. Super disappointed! I hope you guys take care of the situation!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place when I get off of work! Kitchen is still open with there reverse happy hour! Beers on tap for $3,50 and couple appetizer for $3,99.  Server always recognise us and remember what we usually order. Prices are really affordable and the food really good!  Always bring new friends so they can discover our favourite late stop  ( and dogs frendly patio ! )"}
{"text":"Came by on suggestion of a friend, and didn't ever find a need to come back.   Quesadilla was cold, beer was run of the mill. I'm not into fixies so the decor appeal wasn't there; in addition, service was slow. Another place where food could have been made way better at home.    Not sure what the tempsters see in this place?"}
{"text":"Loved the Bell's Two Hearted American IPA they had on tap. The bartenders (2 guys) were engaging and fun, and the hummus was pretty good as well. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great beer on tap and the food is delicious. It's nice to come to a locally owned restaurant with craft beers that change all of the time."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, beautiful patio, food is decent but some things to work on. They've only been open for a week or so. Staff is friendly and attentive, and love the bicycle theme. I'm hoping this place does well."}
{"text":"Great location, yummy food, awesome staff, huge patio...this place is really fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great food and love their Wednesday night  trivia game! Excellent service. We were able to dine in or sit on the patio...loved it!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Poor kitchen though, quality of food and portion size not worth the price. The duck pond is an added bonus, but the patio decor and furniture is cheap. This place has great potential, and I frequent it at least weekly for the beer alone, but I wish they would step up their game in the other areas. Until then they can't compete with similar businesses."}
{"text":"Love the patio atmosphere on the water.  My husband and I have come here for lunch a few times and we both loved the turkey sandwiches with sweet potato fries.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place and the food, the drafts,  and the bartender Lindsey makes it always worth going back too!"}
{"text":"Great selection of a rotating cast of beers. Lunch and happy hour specials are reasonably priced. It is usually a seat yourself operation but the staff always brings water and menus within a minute. Food is quickly prepared and consistently good. Events like karaoke night and trivia, so check ahead! Great happy hour specials. The chicken tenders and anything fried are perfect bar fare. Vegetarians can always find something. Outside seating overlooks a pond--smokers can't control the wind so be prepared for smoke if you're there on a busy night outside. Overall , they've accomplished a friendly and quality neighborhood bar that can accommodate college students, young professionals , and retirees comfortably!"}
{"text":"Love coming here with friends for anything from a quick beer to a birthday celebration. Great vibes with the classic bar feeling and always the friendliest service. The bar tenders will even remember you if you come enough! Many beers on tap always changing providing a great variety.. Not to mention a delicious food menu! I recommended the turkey tacos or the quesadilla."}
{"text":"Been here n every time a great selection of beers! I'm gettn a Salmon BLT...always my \"go to\"..."}
{"text":"Loved it! Great craft beers and food was fresh, fresh! Try the quesadilla, it was amazing! Our waiter, David, was a hoot!"}
{"text":"Five stars for welcoming service and great attitude, four for the food. Happy hour turkey tacos made me so so happy. Good burger. The grilled cheese sandwich sounded a lot better on the menu than it tasted... Especially since they made it wrong and left out two of the cheeses. But they remade it and gave us a replacement to go, plus took it off the bill. Overall they went above and beyond to apologize and make us happy.  My kid liked the pond outside. If it hadn't been so hot that would have been a great place to relax. The inside decor was fun though."}
{"text":"This place is great and a fun place to hang out especially out on the patio. The beer list on draft is really good so many beers and ipas. The food is also good quality for a bar."}
{"text":"Just had the pepper burger and my co-worker had the salmon especial. The burger was delicious with the roasted peppers and cooked perfectly. The salmon especial was grilled salmon with a huge sweet potato stuffed pepper. We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is friendly, clean (yes even the bathrooms), fun and has a great selection of COLD beers! Love the fact that they are located on a small pond. Plenty of windows to let the light in and to view the outside pond area. We had the burgers and they were delicious. Happy Hour is a great deal with food and drink specials. Definitely on our list of places to call home."}
{"text":"Food and staff are great. Haven't had anything bad yet. Happy Hour all day Saturday, great selection of beers  And they have ASU games regardless of what channel they are playing on!"}
{"text":"I had my first experience at Spokes on a Wednesday night. It was fairly slow but not lacking in any sense in customer service. I will preface this by saying I am a very picky eater, and had asked the bartender for a not on the menu meal to satisfy my hunger. He sent out the head chef, Lynessa, and she gladly fulfilled my random request. My one of a kind quesadilla was fabulous and there is an abundance of great beer to choose from. The bartender, Scottie, was very friendly and knowledgable. The outdoor space is amazing being right on the lake, definitely adds a unique quality to the atmosphere. I will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"We were here on Wed. the 9th at lunch time, only had 1 waitress and the bartender. There were 5 of us, service was very slow, what we ordered was all mixed up, waffle fries verses sweet potatoe fries, turkey sliders verses bbq sliders, corn tacos verses flour and the lady that got them couldn't eat them, she said they tasted rotten. We were going to go to Sweet Tomatoes next door but this place looked promising with the patio and the pond but I guess this was the only good thing about it. The best thing was they only charged us for 1/2 of our order. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I have one word for this place, Fantabulous!!!  We always have a great time when we go!! Last night our server was Matt!! He was very attentive to our table and all of our needs... Always made sure that out beer was full and that my wife had her Jamaican 10-speed!!  I invited a few friends with me and they could not believe how great the atmosphere was!!!  And what was really crazy is that Matt our server recognized me from my Yelp page, and actually bought me a beer?? WHAT!?!  I never would have thought to get that type of recognition awesome job Matt, and thanks again buddy!!!  Sorry no pics this time we just had too much fun!!  Will be back ASAP"}
{"text":"It's past time for me to update this review. I stand by my original review that the location, service, and beer is great but the food was \"meh\" at best. The key word is \"was,\" though. Since they opened Spokes has improved their menu significantly. They have solid bar food, excellent vegetarian options, and it is always worth the price for the stuffed poblano pepper as a side. It's gone from a decent place if I am in the area to a place I am sure to mention to anyone visiting that they should check out."}
{"text":"We happened to stumble across this awesome place & have continued to come back!! We LOVE the service & food! The view off the patio is a wonderful plus!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, excellent service. The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  The menu has some unique items and is vegetarian friendly. The rotating beer selection is awesome."}
{"text":"This is our go to place every Friday night. The menu is simple bar food done well.  My favorites are the stuffed poblano pepper, turkey enchiladas, pesto turkey, pork sliders and the garden salad. HH menu go-tos are the wings, pretzel and fried pickles. HH is a great deal.     The bar tenders and staff are friendly and attentive. We have had had a long wait for food one time only. Great neighborhood spot and dog friendly. Hell, the customers are even friendly. We have NEVER had bad service.   You have to take Spokes for what it is. They have a very good selection of beer a very nice selection of alcohol and even have a decent selection of wine- it's basic but decent. The food is not gourmet by any stretch but it is very good bar food."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon lazy lunch with beers, an excellent experience. The food was outstanding, good beer selection and Matt did a great job bartending, waiting tables and keeping a touch on all his customers. The kid zone is a nice idea for families to be able to being their kids and still have a little buffer while being able to keep an eye on them. One drawback of this is if you are sitting near the kids area it can be loud as hell and if you're not a fan of kids very annoying. All in all a very good experience and will return to try the weekend brunch in the near future."}
{"text":"Had a great early dinner with my husband at Spokes. We're long time Tempe residents so have seen this establishment be many a restaurant. Am so hopeful Spokes will make it!!! When we arrived around 4:30pm, a sign alerted us to go to the bar for seating. My husband likes to sit in the bar (I'm OK with that, too) so we found our own table. I love the atmosphere in Spokes (as it was when it was Streets of New York and Uptown Brewery)... open area bar, outdoor seating. So, where we situated ourselves was great!   Didn't take long for our waiter, Max, to address us with a beer list (different than what was on their web site that day). He helped me select a beer that I absolutely enjoyed, as did my husband. Beers were great.  Food: We ordered to split a kale salad and the sirloin sliders. The kale salad was fairly standard in that it is a bitter green dressed-up with a blue cheese dressing (although for my tastes could have had even more of that dressing), pecans, strawberries served around the salad (would like better mixed within the salad). The best thing... the whole salad sat on a balsamic dressing. This dressing really helped cut the bitterness of the kale. So, only change... slice up the strawberries into the salad, add a bit more of the blue-cheese dressing (or offer on the side). Keep that balsamic dressing-so, so good!!! We took home half of the salad.  Sirloin sliders: A lot of places offer 3 sliders. Spokes gave 2. My husband and I didn't go for these right away- ate the salad, and munched on the delicious sweet potato fries that we ordered as a side with the sliders. So, perhaps if we had, they would have been warmer (hotter) to the palate. While there is a pecan pesto, it was lost on the sliders... pretzel bun was great... would like to have had some kind of dipping sauce or sauce on the slider that might be a horseradish/mayo variety... perhaps something the diner could control. The sirloin was tender...great... Needless to say, we ate both!!!  Our side of sweet potato fries was right on!!! These were crisp, hot, and meaty. None were left on the plate!!!   When ordering, we told Max that we were splitting the two orders, so would have appreciated that the food came out split on two plates. Not so. Max was observant and gave us smaller plates for us to do ourselves. Not a biggie, but one of those nice touches that diners appreciate.  Service: Can't say enough how Max was attentive and observant of our needs as diners. We also were eager to chat with Max, and he was able to do so as the early time we were there. The kind of people hired to represent a business matters... we hope to return to Spokes and request Max's area for seating... usually a Thursday through Sunday opportunity!  I look forward to returning. Max recommends the turkey quesadilla and the Carver burger which I will order!!!! For those who might not know, Spokes is a sister restaurant to Boulders on Broadway..."}
{"text":"The complimentary valet parking was great, the food was good, not the best I've ever had, but good and the drinks OMG where the best, but it was very over priced, it was a once in a lifetime experience and not sure if we will be back, if we do come back we will not bring the kids"}
{"text":"What a great time on the patio. DOG FRIENDLY!  Had a great lunch - grilled steak burrito was wonderful - nice balance with the beans, corn, and I think mango? The shrimp tacos were nice, but a bit salty. Although I love the curry slaw that accompanies it.  The staff was very accommodating, despite being very busy!  Great work!  The beer selection is impressive, with out of state and in-state options for a variety of types: stouts, ales, lagers, etc...  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We came in a groups of 12, and were quickly accommodated which was nice. Chicken fingers were pretty good. Other than that, we weren't impressed with the food or service, unfortunately. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Tried Spokes for the first time last night and left really impressed. Our server was friendly, helpful, and very attentive; easily one of the best servers we have ever had. He explained the beer list well, offered tasters, and recommended a couple. We were not let down at all. They had approximately 25 beers on tap and a solid variety, including AZ breweries like Historic and Huss, so there is something for everyone.   The food menu was a pleasant surprise to see. I don't eat meat so that can be challenging but Spokes had a number of vegetarian options. I have to highly recommend the Poblano pepper stuffed with sweet potato mash and queso (I skipped the bacon). The sweetness of the potato really balanced the bite of the pepper. It was an absolute treat.   I'm happy to say we have found a new neighborhood pub to frequent after last night's visit."}
{"text":"I always used to come here and loved it. Typically great service and beers. However, our recent bartender was extremely rude/unprofessional and complaining openly about people in our party. I will wait a long while before spending any more money here."}
{"text":"Have been to spokes a couple times now for happy hour meetings. Great prices on drinks, the food is solid, the service is pretty quick for a bar and the noise levels are tolerable. I enjoy coming back mostly because of the relaxed atmosphere. Stop in for a cold one if you get the chance, and ask for their grilled wings!"}
{"text":"The reason I like this place most is their extensive beer list. Super solid options and always something new. They also have great burgers. So if you feel like a burger and a beer, this is your spot!  Always a pleasant experience. Their staff is great!"}
{"text":"We live across the street from Spokes. After a long day we decided to do a delivery through Amazon Prime. After waiting for 90 minutes we called customer service.  While on hold we received a text that the order was on the way. I hung up with cs and then the driver called for someone to go outside.  The driver, \"Basher\" was waiting next to his car. Then, customer service called and said it was a delay on the restaurant side. Fries were soggy.  You could tell burger had been sitting. We normally tip well. Had a $10 bill by the door to tip on top of the  $5 included.  Needless to say he didn't get it. TERRIBLE SERVICE, TERRIBLE FOOD!"}
{"text":"Spokes has been my Wednesday night go to. Besides having trivia on Wednesday, the great craft beers and awesome sweet potato poblano are amazing. Brian the bartender always has great drinks and service. Trivia is more for college students and current topics which makes it easy to be interested in week to week."}
{"text":"Bad ass view and great happy hour. Every Saturday!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Spokes since it's a short bike ride from my place, but sadly this wasn't the case.  Went for Sunday brunch and tried the stuffed poblano pepper, kale salad, and some brunch special of breakfast nachos.   The breakfast nachos consisted of a tiny portion of soggy waffle fries drowning in a bright orange cheese sauce and specked with miniature bits of egg and bacon. 0/5.  The kale salad was overdressed but tasty. Tiny portion for $9.79, way overpriced. 2/5.  The poblano pepper stuffed with sweet potato and covered in the same bright orange cheese sauce mentioned earlier was good, as promised in all the other reviews. 4/5.  Service was good but the food was way overpriced and underwhelming. Pretty location but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Trivia on mondays, inexpensive appetizers, good beer... Always a good place! The wings can be on the spicy side, so be careful!"}
{"text":"Love this bar/restaurant. Inside is laid back and has various seating scenarios. Outside has misters,fire pit, lake with benches, even ducks. Craft beers are great. Menu changes weekly. Service is always friendly ;) Apps are delish and very reasonable during happy hour. Thumbs up! Regular here now ; )"}
{"text":"I used to live within walking distance of this place and if I want a craft beer I can't find anywhere else, this is my stop!!! Need something by Stone or Lagunitas and want a cool bartender to talk to you??? And the food is great. I just wish the TV set up was better (only thing keeping it from five stars)"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome atmosphere. The staff is great as well. They have a massive beer collection.   Best of all, the cocktails are fantastic! I've never had a weak or bad-tasting drink."}
{"text":"I have tried this ale house/sports bar on more than one occasion and feel that they can step it up as far as menu selection.  The bar is a great place to watch a game and enjoy well selected beers on tap but don't expect to be satisfied with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Horrible! Staff doesn't know what they are doing! Asked to have my burger cooked longer. The server proceeded to argue with me over the doneness of the burger. Who cares. Just complete the order. Manager was nice, food not so good."}
{"text":"I really like coming to Spokes. Not just because it is right next to our office, but because they have good food, a good atmosphere and some really good beer.    The Salmon BLT and the Southwest Turkey are probably my favorite from the sandwich menu but the grilled cheese with bacon, avocado and tomato or the Pesto Turkey are always good, too. The burgers are good and the enchiladas won't disappoint. Pro tip: If you order the enchiladas, ask for the stuffed poblano pepper as your side. You're welcome.   The beer? Yes, these guys know beer. The wait staff is always super friendly and they'll let you know about what they are currently pouring. They have a nice outdoor patio that happens to be dog friendly if that is your thing. Their happy hour is a great deal so don't miss it. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My guy and I tried this restaurant last year and were quite unimpressed with the service and food,  but after I read more positive reviews recently we decided to give it another try as we wanted to enjoy dining at an outdoor patio due to the weather finally cooling off.  There were only 4-5 people on the patio (and not that busy inside either), but still it took quite a while for a server to come to our table (choice of wooden picnic table/benches or table with hard metal chairs but we chose the chairs since at least they have a back on them).  We ordered and then waited at least 20 minutes before we saw the server again which was frustrating because I wanted to order some wine.  The server was pleasant so I didn't want to fuss but he should have been able to answer my question about what kind of red wine they offered.  He said he would go back to the bar to ask, but I said \"That's OK, I'll just have whatever kind of Cabernet you have.\" If I let him leave again there was no telling when he'd return and then I'd need to wait even longer for him to go back and get the wine for me.  The stuffed poblano wasn't good - very odd - and we only ate the actual pepper because the stuffing was yucky.  The hummus platter was also strange - odd tasting hummus with some kind of white cheese sprinkled on it, and it was served with white bread vs. pita or nice crackers of some kind, and the celery & carrots were dry and old. The so called bruschetta brought us more white bread (not toasted), and was decent but nothing I would order again.  The patio has no ambiance itself, but at least if you sit near the edge of the water you get a decent view of it as well as a bunch of ducks.  'Last time for us to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"This place is so promising, you start out with the cool cycle-centric design similar to the new PedalHaus Brewery on Mill, and you add in a little dart board and ping-pong table action in the back (like The Yard) and top it off with a great list of craft brews on tap...you'd really think this place is going to be your new hang out. Then, you show up...  First of all, this place is deserted. It's a weekday, lunch hour, surrounded by businesses of all kinds a place like this should be hopping. Instead there's maybe 2 tables filled in the whole place. At least it'll be quick, right? Wrong. Turns out there's only one waitress and one bartender on duty, during what should be the busiest time of their day.   The menu is bare bones, with a bunch of weird riffs on \"southwestern\" food with attempts to elevate them with things like feta cheese and spinach wraps in burritos. We ordered the jerk seasoned wings, and we received some overly crunch wings that taste seasoned, sure, but definitely not jerk seasoned. The food was bland overall, decent portions, but definitely overpriced for what you got. To top that off, it took a good 40 minutes for us to get our food (4 people) in an empty restaurant. Craziness. To top it all of  the food was completely cold. If you're going to make me wait, at least make sure the food is hot when it shows up.  The real bummer though was the beer. I ordered a Goose Island Sofia right after we ordered our food. 30 minutes later, no beer. We asked and the waitress had forgotten completely. She went over and made the order with the bartender and the beer finally showed up about 15 minutes later. Honestly, it was nothing like described and the \"sparkly\" beer tasted quite flat to me. I gave to one of my lunch mates, he seemed to like it ok but he also enjoyed horse stable flavored wines (a review for another time).  Overall I'm guessing this place used to be a nice spot for lunch, I'm not sure what changed exactly but I'd strongly advise you to look elsewhere. The 4 star average must be for a spot that doesn't exist anymore. Go to PedalHaus if you want good brews on tap and the bicycle design features. if you want to play games while enjoying an afternoon happy hour go to The Yard. Skip this place. Great little location, but a waste of space in the end..."}
{"text":"Win or lose with service here. I recommend sitting AT the bar. It has been more efficient there. Seems that they are often running on a skeleton crew with employees running the inside as well as patio. My recommendation, designate a server to the patio whenever possible! Sat out there and found the service to be slow. Can't complain about cheap decent drinks! Had the Moscow mule, made spicy by substituting the vodka with jalapeño infused tequila.. YUM! I love their cauliflower wings as a vegetarian, who typically lacks bar food options. The hot sauce is delicious - will mAke your nose run. Guacamole is fresh but hardly any flavor.. not enough lime juice or jalapeño. Would be a higher rating if the service was more attentive.. took nearly 10 minutes to get waters. Again, I understand going between inside & outside.. seems excessive to have one worker making drinks at the bar and taking both patio & inside tables... take what you can handle. Another piece of advice, greet the table with waters made! Everyone needs water in Arizona summers anyhow."}
{"text":"I got the canyon burger and it was probably the best burger I have ever had in my life. My son had a good time playing the arcade games. There wasn't a wait and our server was attentive. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've eaten everything on the menu here and it is good! Try the spinach enchiladas if you're feeling adventurous! They're great!"}
{"text":"The food and beer selection was pretty good, but the service is horrible.  The waiter was friendly and joked around with us throughout the meal, but it took forever to get anything.  We were there for over two hours just to eat dinner.  It took 20 minutes for my friend to get a bloody mary (she got it after she finally asked where it was), and my boyfriend spent a good 15 minutes waiting for a soda refill (after he had asked twice)  It took over an hour for us to get our food.  Two of my friends ordered the 10 piece wings, but when the food came out, one plate had 6 on it and the other had 7?  What was going on in the kitchen? We would've spent more time there and ordered more drinks, but the service was so slow that we were afraid we'd be stuck there for another two or three hours and we had somewhere else to be.  It wasn't busy at all in there either, so I'm not sure what the holdup was."}
{"text":"Great tap selection  Decent food  Absolutely CRAP service.   I had to walk inside, leaving my daughter and dog outside, to order beer and food....TWICE.     Awful.   Aloof.   Annoying."}
{"text":"One star is still too high for this place. I walked in to go get lunch and stood there for 5 minutes waiting. I finally decided to walk around and try to find someone. I spent another 5 minutes and still no one could be found to help me and my friends. we decided that this place was not worth the wait. I'm extremely disappointed and pissed. I heard such great things about the food here and it got ruined by the shitty service I had received. Never coming back and definitely not recommending to friends/family!!"}
{"text":"Wow! One of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time! Breakfast grilled cheese! Very friendly service."}
{"text":"My fiance and I discovered Spokes one Saturday night when our original plans were upended by the big UFC fight. Spokes has amazing service, great food, and a great beer selection. They usually have a couple craft ciders too! I highly recommend going on Saturday as they have all day happy hour and their appetizers can't be beat. Definitely get the fried pickle bucket, pretzel, and the wings (they take requests on how hot you want them!)"}
{"text":"Wow. Another 5 star post. :) I don't know if anyone's noticed (that's just the insecure writer in me talking), but I post a lot of 5 star reviews. Not to sound conceited, but if I go to a place, that means its good.  \"I'm just sayin'!\"  I know that sounds bad, but people like me are destined to rub people the wrong way.  That will not happen at Spoke's though. \"Spokes On Southern\" if I'm being exact, instead of lackadaisical.  This wonderful restaurant and bar is right in my neighborhood, and even though we have so much to choose from in Arizona to spend our beer dollars, this is one of the places that deserves the whisking of plastic against a terminal. That charge on your debit card will never be regretted. The beers on tap change constantly, which provides the benefit of variety to customers like myself, and the satisfaction of plentiful choices to the discerning palette. Examples include the \"Piehole Porter\" and the local Arizonian \"Inebriator\". I would find it hard to believe that a beer lover would leave here dissatisfied-especially when you can get premium local beers for only $3 during happy hour. Their food isn't half bad either, and even if it was, the value you're getting would make McDonald's marketing executives run back to their holes to do another SWOT analysis.  My humble request is that you would try this place after seeing my review. The service is great, and the people who work here are welcoming and friendly. It's great for groups, a get to know you meeting, or just hanging out by yourself at the bar. The last would be me. A vote of confidence from your friendly  neighborhood mom & pop reviewer-no red and blue spandex. :)"}
{"text":"Good beer selection, but food was slow getting to table despite the place being empty, and not well prepared. Breakfast burrito lukewarm at best. \"The chef is busy\". BS! Skip this place."}
{"text":"This place is perfect!  Not only did I have a great burger and an amazing beer selection, I learned that they use all local beef from grass fed cows.  Amazing!  Now I can feel much better about my choice to go out and have a tasty burger!!  You add that their food is really inexpensively priced, they have indoor bike parking and their patio is dog friendly....I'm not going anywhere else for great pub food.   Also their staff were all fun to talk to.  So glad I tried them.  Hats off to Matt (our server) who was great to talk to and seemed like a sincerely nice guy.  We'll be back as often as we can!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times since a co-worker lives across the street and that made this a convenient place to meet. Same mall as Sweet Tomatoes and the southeastern branch of Los Reyes De La Torta. They've got a bicycle theme going - hence the name Spokes. Bicycle tires make up some of the decor and a few bicycles hang from the ceiling. When you walk in, you can go straight ahead to the back area of the bar or turn left and sit at one of the seats around the main bar. We sat at the bar and chilled. I had all sorts of crafty beers - can't remember the names now so I probably had too many. They give you a sheet with all the names of the available beers but I had to download the app instead - YES! they have a Spokes On Southern app! - mainly because I had to squint and use the flashlight app to read their tiny font beer list. Lindsey was our bartender/server and she was very nice - always smiling no matter what. Food - no soups in the summer, by the way. That was not mentioned on the 2 pager of a laminated menu. I had the turkey and bacon enchiladas. It hit the spot and was quite decent. Friends ordered the burger and Bruschetta Planks. This place also has one of those Touch Tunes jukeboxes you can control from your phone via app. Unlike most places, this jukebox doesn't block out any songs - even the usual censored \"explicit\" labelled ones. Pro tip: if you wanna get on Lindsey's good side, fill up the jukebox playlist with requests for Operation Ivy tunes. Will be back for sure sometime."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and it's great every time! The food is done well consistently, each dish has a unique twist that makes it great. The 3-pepper burger and the turkey enchiladas are particularly good. The BBQ turkey sliders are my favorite appetizer. Service is always friendly and attentive. The place itself is clean and nicely decorated and is a great place for a laid-back night. Hint: they support sports teams so if you bring your team there (I go with my softball team) they have special discounted beers and menu items for you!  My only negative is that sometimes service suffers when it gets busy, but they always apologize for that which is all I really need. Overall, a wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato stuffed poblano pepper as a side - Remember these words as they will be important when you order. Good food with both a southwestern and slight bistro flair. Casual dining with somewhat of a bicycle theme. Super peppy waitstaff and a nice outdoor seating area with a couple fire pits. Good beer selection and quite good cocktails. Repeat - get the stuffed poblano pepper!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place after a while living in Tempe and after a while it became our favorite spot.   The staff are all fun people who are easy to talk to, Cooper, the manager, works his ass off and does a great job keeping up with everything. Our favorite bartender there was Dave, he is hilarious.   As for the food, I am a vegetarian and they have some great options for me. I usually got the veg head sandwich or the carver burger and subbed in their amazing veggie patty that they make in house. My boyfriend loved the salmon BLT.  They always have rotating beers and you can always find something you'll love no matter what your taste, and a large number of them are local AZ breweries. They also have great Moscow Mules!  The restaurant is cute with the bike theme and very specious so it doesn't feel overcrowded. They have a lot of fun stuff like trivia nights and darts in the back, and in the daytime they are usually a bit slower so it's a good place to hang out. They also have a patio which is wonderful when the weather is nice and it sits right on the edge of a little business park/lake.  I recently moved out of Tempe and I can honestly say that Spokes is going to be one of the things that I miss most about it."}
{"text":"Beer on tap that rotates with the season and they have my moose drool beer.  Also the food is really good my boyfriend loves the Spokes burger and I love the pasta.   Oh they also deliver!"}
{"text":"We come here pretty often to watch the hockey games. I love the boneless mild chicken wings. The caluiflower wings are really good too."}
{"text":"It's just so expensive even for craft beers...the worst is that bar tenders and wait staff are all trained to tell you the same thing when you ask why they're only bringing you a 10 oz pour. They say it's because of the alcohol content...which isn't true...and they know it...or they should know it!! As a matter of fact just last night they pulled that BS on me and she said...\" Sir, anything with 8% or higher ABV is poured in 10 oz glass.\" I said well that beers not 8%....when she checked (because of course I'm wrong) she came back and said, \"well it's a really rare keg and it's about profitability\"....yeah. That's what I thought...$5.85 for a 10 oz Oskar Blues IPA...too expensive. You'd think a place owned by the owner of Boulders would be a great place too...but as they are quick to point out \"this isn't Boulders...\" To which I easily reply \"you're damn right it's not!\" The food is just ok...the wait staff is hit and miss"}
{"text":"I went on opening weekend long ago. My idea of a fun night out is not sitting around a wooden table and trying craft beer only to struggle through it because it tastes like ass. Sorry folks, I will just stick to my Coors and Budweiser. With that said, maybe this is wrong of me but Spokes is not really my type of place. Even when ordering my \"crappy\" beer it took a while to get a bartender and be served. I felt like it was a place where all the beer coneseuirs come and chat about beer - smelling it, takign a swig and swishing it around in their mouth, talking about the ingredients, and talking about how badass the brewery is instead of a place where you can have a steady stream of Coors Light sitting in front of you. Which is fine, I just personally don't really have a desire to talk about such things."}
{"text":"The first time I came to spokes it was for a business meeting, it was happy hour and I was just looking over the table tent looking to see if anything stuck my fancy. My friend was on his phone reading off beers, and I was interested. The Entire Beer Menu and Food Menu are built into an APP? WHAT!!!! I was able to browse my phone right quick and know all about the best drafts on tap, and take a good look at the menu before the waitress comes to get my order.  It was really interesting. I ordered a San Tan Mr. Pineapple Beer, (very Taste, Much Pine, WOW) and some turkey tacos. I thought it sounded a little weird, but I'm a chef so I figured i can put Thanksgiving in a burrito, Tacos are a great choice. I grabbed some BBQ wings as well, the Happy Hour food here is really cheap but pretty good. Now this is my new local bar, it's right down there street, and the app even lets me know when my favorite beers are back on tap. AMERICA"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but HORRIBLE food. Everything we tried tasted like it had been frozen, including the fries. For a college town it's amazing that they have no vegan options. The lemonade tasted like Countryrtime powder. There were five of us and we were all VERY DISAPPOINTED with our food."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I moved from San Diego and love this place! We ordered from Amazon Prime Now and the food came hot, not soggy at all, and the flavor was so good! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I must have caught them on a very bad day. Just finish having their Salmon Especial which should be called the Salmon Oh-So-Bland. It was flavorless and dry. Such a shame. It came with a stuffed poblano pepper that was covered with way too much cheese. I had to scoop most of it off to reveal nothing at all special. Oh and the portion size were quite small. I just made myself a salad because I was still hungry. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I been there twice now friendly staff great Beer choices and really good food.  You have to try the Grilled Cheese with pear and onions WOW great job Spokes...."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here at least once a week.  We love the rotating beer selections that are updated almost daily. If you like craft beer and trying new brews out, this is the place to go!  We love making it to their awesome happy hour.  Their food menu is fantastic also (love the stuffed poblano).  We are never disappointed when we come here.  Our server, Jerome, is one of the best in town and he is always happy to give recommendations on what's on draft.  Jerome works hard to make sure all of his guests are happy, which is why we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Spokes offers a great beer selection, many on tap.   Currently on tap they have one of my favorites, Hess Coffee Kolsch.  Happy hour is pretty good as far as discounted food and drinks. I really like the turkey tacos, mmmm so good.  All the Bartenders here at Spokes are pretty nice down to earth people as well.  So if you're a beer connoisseur like me, I would definitely check them out."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The bathrooms were closed when I went, so I walked across the street to Sweet Tomatoes. The next time I went they were fixed. Staff checked in frequently. Great place to bring your dog outdoors on the patio! Spacious enough to bring your friends!"}
{"text":"Came in for the Wolf Pack IIPA tapping on #NationalIPADay...good tasting balanced IPA w/ some citrus hops + bready malt & agave nectar in the finish = well done...sirloin street tacos w/ rice & black beans on the side came out cold but tasted great - did not skimp on the sirloin! Tap list as always is great, service is personable, friendly & good...that 4th star is for the brews; unfortunately i still have to go with 3 for the food - but that is working its way past the bar food label into the gastopub arena;...keep it up Spokes; i'll keep coming back"}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend and his daughter because his co-workers raved about it...Either we cam on a bad night or their tastes in food is whack.  Anyway, was so excited when my boyfriend said they had these awesome (sounding) Grilled Cheese sandwiches.  I chose the bacon and pear.  My boyfriend got a burger and so did his daughter.  We also the the app with all the diff fried veggies.  For drinks I got an Angry Orchard cider (wanted a heff but server said they don't have any... really??) My boyfriend go some other cider thing. and then since it was Sunday and their Bloody Mary's were $5, I decided to have one of those too (it was a rough day).  So let's start with the app.  Most of the veggies and cheese curds were pretty good (pickles, green beans, not sure about the Okra because I don't like it, but the BF and his daughter ate 'em.  The corn fritter things tasted like corn and raw pancake batter on the inside.  Some of the smaller cheese curds were like rubber.  The spicy aoli was good, the taziki was whack.  It was not smooth with chunks of cucumber or just smooth is was like they put the cukes in a food processor and threw them in a cup.  It was just weird.  The cider was good and so was the ale/cider thing my bf got.  the Bloody Mary was horrible.  Mix was thin and watery (f it was a mix) didn't have that \"zing\" to it, just blech.  The Food.  The server said they cook their burgers \"pink\" in the middle and that is how he likes them.  Nope, well done.  Secondly, his buns were BLACK like completely burnt.  Who lets that get out of the kitchen, huh?  They do.  His daughters was very dark too, but she was hungry so she just ate it that way, he asked for diff buns.  My grilled cheese.  First off, it was toasted bread.  Not yummy, buttery, crispy, crunchy deliciousness you expect from a grilled cheese.  No oozing cheese (supposed to have Brie, Blue Cheese and Cheddar) no brie, no blue.  I asked the manager(?) when he brought out my bf's plate with new buns and asked him about the cheese conundrum.  I opened the sandwich and told him to look.  He says, \"there is a some blue cheese right there (it was the size of the tip of pencil lead).  He also told me that they don't put a lot of brie or blue because they are very strong and pungent cheeses.  Brie is strong and pungent???  And yes, blue is and I love it, so I want the flavors come out in the sandwich.  That grilled cheese was $9.00! I was very very dissapointed.  I make WAY better grilled cheese and it doesn't cost me $9.00.  The waffle cut fries were gross but I DID love their sweet potato fries, and they did taste homemade.  Service was great!  The bill was almost $70.00 for that crap, never again.  Even his daughter said she didn't want to come back and she isn't a food snob like my bf and I.  Sorry Spokes on Southern, looks like you gotta flat."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this place for quite a while. It is the perfect place to hang out with a group of friends and just relax. Yesterday a group of us we're buying drinks during the evening and when our friend brought a drink, the bartender made a comment to him about the tips we were giving to him. He stated that he was mad that our table wasn't tipping him enough and called one of my friends carpal tunnel girl. Regardless of how much we tipped (many of us tipped generously but now I regret it), it is unprofessional to state that especially to a customer who is apart of that group. We know the service industry is hard and customers can take a toll on the work day (we weren't any trouble) but the way we were thrown under the bus has now caused us to take our business elsewhere. Sorry Spokes."}
{"text":"The view of the pond is great; they also have ducks. The food was 4.5 on a 5 scale and the service a 5. They have outdoor seating with a fire grill table and plenty of lounge area. Definitely a place to meet people to eat, drink and kick back."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. I have been sitting on the patio for one hour and have seen the server a total of two times. Odd being that there is no one here. Was going to try out a sandwich but decided to leave and get food elsewhere as I'm not wanting to wait another hour to get food at the pace the service is coming. Nice patio but would not recommend."}
{"text":"Our server Jerome was awesome. Kitchen messed up on our food which wasn't a huge deal (we all work in the service industry) but he felt so bad he bought us each a drink for the mess up. Definitely didn't need to do that as the wait for the food wasn't that long. Good food, good drinks, glad we came."}
{"text":"Good beer list, but the menu and service are poor at best."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place, especially since the patio is dog friendly. But once we got here the doors were locked. We understood it was a Sunday and there was a chance they would be reasonably busy. Someone who worked there opened the door for us and exclaimed if we planned on ordering food it would take over 2 hours. When we said we would be ok sitting on the patio they said \"well there's like 100 people out there but I guess you can test your luck\".  Not sure if they were just overwhelmed or what but they were so unwelcoming.   We did check the patio and there was maybe 35-40 people out there.   Overall pretty disappointed with our customer service experience and we didn't even eat there, which leads me what they treat paying patrons like."}
{"text":"Truly enjoy the staff, food & atmosphere! Great place to hangout, relax with friends. Food is delicious and always fresh. Great wings & happy hour prices! Offers karoke & trivia nites, pool table, meeting area."}
{"text":"This is a decent bar. Jerome is a nice bar tender. I give this place a lower rating because of an experience with one of the servers, Shelby. She was straight up rude, shaming the bar tender and us, the patrons. A nice place to belly up and have lunch. The burgers are tasty. They have a uniquely, strange menu. A fellow bar bellier recommended the stuffed poblano appetizer and raved about it. I'm impressed and not a chicken baby of different flavors. Not a waste of time or a bad place. I'm neutral."}
{"text":"I can't get over how rad this place is. From the top down, this place offers an exceptional drinking and dining experience.   Spokes features well over twenty taps of rotating beers from around the country (though most are from the west/southwest). A not insignificant number of taps feature local brews, including beers from Four Peaks. If you like beer and enjoy sampling a lot of different brews, you will LOVE Spokes.   I would love Spokes just for the beer, but their food is even better. If you've never dined here before, you need to start with the grilled cheese. They start with a robust blend of cheeses and allow you to customize it with nearly fifteen different fillings ranging from bacon and tomato to pear and basil. I have never had a better grilled cheese from a restaurant before. My boyfriend fills his with tomato and avocado, while I usually opt for pear, basil, and onion (and sometimes I get adventurous with jalapeño, which they freshly slice in the kitchen). Served with a healthy helping of the most delicious waffle fries, this all-American classic will delight your tastebuds.   Desserts aren't on their menu, but the chef writes them out on a chalkboard on the dining room. There's an area for your little ones, karaoke starting at 9 on Tuesdays, trivia on Mondays, and a super chill vibe every day. The patio overlooks the lake and is dog-friendly.   Ultimately, a bar with great beer and fabulous food is nothing without great customer service. Dave and Scott are two of the bartenders here, and they are some of the best in the business. They clearly love their jobs, and it's fun to chat with them about beer (or anything, really). They're honest about what they like and dislike and are always good for a recommendation if you're not sure what beer to order.  If you're looking for a fab place to hang, drink delicious beer, and get a great meal, look no further than Spokes. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pros: Good atmosphere, nice/friendly waitress, decent food, good portion sizes  Cons: main issue was the slow service, overpriced for quality and portion of food, chairs were very low the ground with a higher table  What we got: Southwest Turkey Sandwich and Sweet potato fries - both good, along with portion sizes.  Veggie tacos with waffle fries - fries were fresh and crispy, tacos were tiny and average for how much they were Chips and guac - pricey, but worth splitting  Overall not horrible, but probably won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"My kids recently moved out of state and have me their coupons for this place. So happy they did. I was in the mood to try a new place so I went. I got a grilled steak burrito which was perfection. They put a roasted poblano which just made the meal.i had enough for two meals so I got something to take home. Turkey bacon enchiladas!!!! Oh man I just couldn't decide what I liked better. I loved the guacamole. I loved the beer. It's a clean, cool place to go. I've heard they have bands there, Kareoke. I will definitely go back. Plenty of room for a huge crowd. A definite I'll be back."}
{"text":"My family and I went to spokes for the first time today. I was beyond impressed!! The atmosphere is so welcoming! I love how the place is decorated and the fact that it's next to the pond with ducks is so cute :-) the staff was so friendly. We ordered the guacamole which was made to order, so delicious! I also recommend the turkey quesadilla, pulled turkey slides and the turkey tacos.. Pretty much anything with turkey haha! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Spokes for a couple years now and still get upset every time knowing that when I was in college, I lived right across the street and never realized there was an awesome bar right there! I'm now approaching my 30s and definitely appreciate how low key this bar is! It definitely has an amazing relaxed setting and you can never go wrong with a bicycle theme bar.  The beers they have on draft never disappoint! And they're constantly rotating so there's always something new to try!  I do wish they offered flights of beers so that you can sample the huge list of drafts they have on tap without having to order full sized beers and getting schwasted.  But nevertheless I'm always satisfied with my choices here and will continue to make this my usual spot!"}
{"text":"Food: The food is Holly cannoli  good. I had the enchilada and the stuffed poblano. I must say I think I could eat the stuffed poblano every day for the remainder of my life, it is that good! They also have a good selection of beers.  Location: The location is nothing special, its just in a small shopping center. However the actual restaurant is rather cute and fun.  Service: The only thing that kept me from giving Spokes on Southern a 4 or 5 star rating was the service. We seated ourselves and it took 15 minutes to get a waiter to even come by our table. Beyond that food took an hour to actually receive after we saw it waiting in the window for about 15 minutes. My food was cold, I actually asked the waitress if she could pop it in the microwave for me,  which they cant after you have taken a bite. This does speak volumes about their food however because it was cold took an hour to get and was still stellar, then again maybe I was starving. I do think they were short staffed, but there were only about 7-10  guest their. I think If I do go again I would see about carryout options."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Friendly staff, great beer selection and amazing food.  The grilled cheese is fabulous.  Who know pear and avocado would taste so good on a grilled cheese sandwich. Scott the bartender is such a cool guy so sit at the bar when you can."}
{"text":"Honestly we keep giving this place a chance for a love of the duck pond and patio where our kids are entertained. And I have regrets every time we go. The service is horrible. Every freaking time. Yesterday we went with our family from out of town, it was pretty embarrassing. Not enough waters were brought out for the table, no cream came with the coffee, chicken and waffles were toddler-size portion, we got the wrong filling in one of our breakfast burritos, and our server had to be hunted down to get a refill on coffee. I want the restaurants in Tempe to be great. I hope this place improves its service, the food gets better and becomes a little less sloppy overall. Because I really love that duck pond and I want to eat delicious food and have basic service while I sit next to it."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town for the Ironman and wanted some good food and beer.  This place was close to the house so we stopped  in for lunch. David, the bartender, was very friendly and knowledgable. Great beer selection! Everything our group ate was delicious. Try the stuffed poblano pepper - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"As a Brunch destination it's basically morning bar food. The chicken and waffles wasn't bad, but it wasn't much of a standout either. The Biscuits and gravy was a mixed blessing. The gravy was very good (except for the large amount of Rosemary caught in your teeth afterwards) but the biscuits were underdone and clearly out of a tube.    The service was excellent, and the atmosphere was very much urban pub. All told it was a good meal, but I'll probably try something new before I'll find myself here again."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for lunch on Friday. The place wasn't very busy, just a few tables here and there. We sat ourselves and then waited close to ten minutes to get a menu. The waiter returned a few minutes later and took our drink and food order. Then we waited forever to get our food. I was a little irritated about the long wait until I realized the ladies sitting next to us had been there since before us and they got their food way after we did.  I ordered the steak burrito with waffle fries and really enjoyed them. My husband and daughter ordered burgers and they both enjoyed their meals as as well. The food was very fresh and the portion sizes were just right. The children's menu offers a nice variety and some healthier options. The place is very cool and family friendly. They have a variety of games and toys to entertain. The also have an impressive beer menu. Hopefully today was just a bad day. I will try them again when I can actually enjoy a beer and have more time to be patient."}
{"text":"I can drink a beer and watch ducks. Who would not find that relaxing. This is my second time here and i'm hooked, the food is excellent but the beer options are even better plus the bartenders know what they are talking about when it comes to the beer options.  I think the only thing that keeps me a  regular is i finally have a place that can cook a median-rare burger to perfection. BTW your waffle are better than chick-fil-a."}
{"text":"We stopped by again since we were in the area. Carne asada tacos were very good and hit the spot. They are VERY citrusy so if your stomach is sensitive (like my husband) it may not be a good choice for you. Service was good. Loved the tea."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and beer selection. At first, boulders on Broadway was way better to me, however, I think this place is great as well and hope it continues to imrprove...  The happy hour turkey tacos were amazing! The time I was there months ago the cheese dip was eh...  I I like this place."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I have been here twice for food. The last time I dined here, I felt like I was unknowingly part of a comedy sketch or something. I ordered sliders with fries... My slider had a hair in it. I informed the server (who was very nice) and he sent my food back. I kept my fries so I could have something to eat while my friend ate. I waited for my food, and I kid you not, I waited 45 minutes for them to be delivered. They would have been ready before then but they got taken to the wrong table. My server kept checking back to see if I had my food... Nope. But he didn't seem to have the sense of urgency to get my food out to me, especially having it take that long. He took my fries away and said he would bring me fresh ones with my sliders... Okay. Finally, my sliders came out, but with the wrong type of fries. They really couldn't get this food out to me correctly... There was no rush to make sure I had my food, and my friend was long since finished with his food before I FINALLY got mine. The server comped my food and drink which was nice, but the fact I had to wait that long, for sliders, and the fact that I had my fries taken away and replaced with the wrong ones, was definitely a joke. Will not eat here again. Might come back for a drink though (maybe)."}
{"text":"Worst service ever we waited an hr for our food, when they finally brought out our food all were wrong and they forgot one meal entirely. The excuse was the kitchen was slammed. So I got up and saw the entire inside dining area was almost empty. Don't go there unless you want no service and a upset stomach."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Their beer selection is great, their happy hour has extremely good deals, and the servers there all have fun personalities and are very attentive. Jerome is THE BEST! They also have a ping pong table, such a fun change compared to any other restaurants/bars around the area!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite neighborhood places! Never too crowded or roudy but always great food, good drink, and awesome atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed - the outside of the building is very nice and that's about where everything stopped. The tacos were so-so, not that great and slightly overpriced. They were blaring loud music - one minute it was 50's/60's music and the very next song was wrap. I'm confused about this place!"}
{"text":"We moved to a new neighborhood and this is now our local bar.  I'm really enjoying the ambiance.  Love the pond outside.  Look forward to having breakfast and a Bloody Mary out there when the weather cools off.  Really have enjoyed the cauliflower appetizer with BBQ sauce on it.  Also love the French fries dipped in wing sauce and ranch.  The mini sliders were a bit dry.  I like watching hockey and volleyball on the TV's.  Would be fabulous of they had bigger TV's and a few more.  The music is usually very good.  Like the games available to play. Clean bathroom.  Friend wished they had better be selection but I understand that changes frequently."}
{"text":"We really enjoy sitting outside on their dog-friendly patio! They have a great burger my husband likes (The Carver) and a yummy caprese salad. In particular my husband likes their craft beer selection!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Boulders on Broadway, so when the manager mentioned that Spokes is the same owner, I wanted to check it out. The food was really great with more things on the menu I hope to go back and try soon. I thought it might be a carbon copy of Boulders, but the selections were different, but maintained the focus on upping the ante for bar food.   The servers were so friendly! On a slow night - there was some improv think going on in another part of the very large space - they chatted with us, welcoming us as our first time at the bar. Happy hour was $1 off all drinks, not amazing but they said perhaps food specials are in the works, but for the friendly service, good food and super convenient location, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Arizona. The food is incredible, the beer selection is on point, and the staff is amazingly friendly. They have great events like wine tastings, karaoke nights, and trivia. Definitely the perfect place to visit with the family, grab a drink with some friends, or relax after work. I recommend Spokes to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"I was expecting this to be more of a bar. There were so many children running around, squealing, and bouncing off the walls it was rather unpleasant.   It took quite some time to receive our food. He had the grilled cheese. It was good, different, and made with blue cheese. It just wasn't hot.  I had the veg head sandwich. The description said grilled portabella mushroom, etc. I'm not sure if this sandwich is supposed to be hot or not. It wasn't. The fries on both our plates were good just nothing was hot at all."}
{"text":"Looks like I found my Saturday hung out spot with my husband. I love that they have happy hour all day on Saturdays. In my opinion, they have a decent menu with food options along with drinks. Super excited to come back!"}
{"text":"I was at spokes on a Saturday night after I went to the first annual pizza festival. we were cut off after having a few adult beverages at a table with a few friends. very unnecessary, considering we were full of pizza and just wanted to come there for a few drinks. definitely will not be back here, although the waitress was very considerate and friendly. the bartender apparently did not want our business and we chose not to give it to her even though we were not intoxicated. would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Delicious food with an excellent selection of brews. Servers are very friendly and knowledgable.  The happy hour is a great value and I love that it lasts all day and night on Saturdays. The turkey tacos are amazing! Also, the outdoor patio is large and sits next to a nice duck pond. My only knock is that the outdoor furniture is in desperate need of being replaced, as a lot of it is dirty and literally falling apart. If that patio was in better shape this place would undoubtedly be a 5 star. UPDATE: I came here on Sunday and all of the broken down patio furniture had been replaced with picnic tables (nice touch). Bumping my review up to a 5 star."}
{"text":"DONT COME WHEN THEYRE BUSY. My girlfriend and I stopped in around 8.15p for a late night snack, and wanted to spend a nice time on their patio after a long & sh***y day at work.  Sat down and gave us a menu and water...  20 minutes later..... empty water and no one taking our drink and food order...  decided to leave.  It seems as though the owner doesnt care, because there are a few reviews here about bad service.... oh well what can you do except give a explanation of how busy you were....  Busy enough to not care what people write on Yelp.  As a business owner myself, I would never let a bad review go unnoticed.  I would never recommend this place even if the food is good."}
{"text":"This Place has a great Patio.... and umm did I mention the nice patio?  My first trip was in for a lunch. At some points we were the only customer. Yet our appetizer order was still omitted for some reason.  Our first selection of beer was also a bust, as the well worn paper beer list was not up to date.  My fish tacos were lacking to say the least. The fish was small and tasted like fried frozen fish sticks on old tortillas.  On another trip I got to try a few apps for happy hr. The Queso is nothing special with some franks red hot sauce on top. The coli-flour wings are just fried (not breaded) coli-flour with sauce and the nachos were quite weak with a sprinkling of cheese and some queso sauce and a dollop sour cream. A far cry from the nachos of my dreams from other local breweries.   This location has been a revolving door over the years each business lasts 2-4 years, I wonder how long spokes will last."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, and has a really good draft selection! I got the wings and there were a lot more drumsticks than flats which was a little disappointing, but my boyfriend got the Salmon BLT and a side salad and thought it was amazing! The food came out quickly and the staff there was very friendly! Definitely a great place to drop into!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the staff was awesome.  They kept checking to see if we were ok, and not just our waiter either. Food portions were decent. Not to big and not to small.  Also has both indoor and outdoor seating by the water."}
{"text":"We finally had a chance to try Spokes living only a mile away. Once we walked in, nobody greeted us until we asked someone if we just seat ourselves? So we walked to our table and waited about 10 mins for menus. They walked away and we waited another 10 mins for water. Came back and order drinks and our food. Took another 10 mins for our drinks. I order a salmon blt and 45 mins later I asked how much longer? His response was their salmon takes longer to cook? Wtf? Takes about 10 mins tops! The service was incredibly slow and the manager walked by several times knowing we've been waiting so long and never checked on us once! Food was good, but that visit was our last one. They had their staff waiting tables all over the place. Seat yourself service doesn't work! Needs better management!"}
{"text":"Definitely glad I found this place! Good food and large selection of beer. I had their turkey tacos and sweet potato fries which were delicious! I was also pleasantly surprised to find that they had my favorite white wine, New Age! I'd recommend going for happy hour and on a cooler day the patio seating (with lake view) is awesome. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Love spokes, local bar by work. If you go with a group definitely pre book as service can be slow if you catch them short staffed! Love my beer and they had plenty of variety, go in happy hour or that bill can stack up very quick."}
{"text":"Made it out to spokes yesterday to catch up with friends. Such a cool place. The patio overlooks Spirit of yoga's pond which makes a nice view. Service here is awesome! The bartenders really know their brew and the appetizers are tasty.  The patio is dog friendly and I immediately had regrets for not bringing jasper.  The unique variety of beer on tap is exciting and there is a cool lounging area to watch the game. It's bike themed so all the small art detail is wicked cool.  Thanks for a great after spokes staff!"}
{"text":"Eight ducks a swimming. Seven turtles sunning on the rocks. Six fish a swimming. Five golden rays of sun glinting on the pond.  Words to a new Christmas carol? No. Just my view from my table at Spokes. This bicycle themed business is next to a shady pond with all of the lovely animals mentioned above. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating. I arrived at 11am and the sign said to seat myself and I did. I was the only person around, but my server spotted me quickly, took my order, and brought some ice water. She checked back with me several times during my meal to make sure I was doing OK.   I had the steak burrito (very tasty) with waffle fries ($10). The background music was Billy Joel, Crosby-Stills-Nash-Young, etc. A half a dozen flat screen TVs were scattered around the spaces (all tuned to sports stations for some reason). They have a gazillion beers on the menu, but what I was really craving was some apple cider and did not see any on the menu. Hey, it is autumn and not everyone likes beer. I know this is an ale house, but a nice Redds Apple Ale would have been nice.  The place looks clean. Parking is close to the door. The view makes me want to bring my grandchildren (they would love the ducks and turtles), but they do not appear to have a kid's menu and seem more set up for sports fans and bar patrons."}
{"text":"I really like the vibe here. Very chill and relaxing. Service was great too. Added bonus, they had my favorite beers on tap...Four Peaks Peach Ale...yum!    I liked the decor and the clientele.  Guests ranged from families to the older crowd. Pretty cool for a place to attract all types. The food was ok, not great in my book. It could have been a bit better had my food been warmer. I could have sent it back but I was already starving!  It didn't lack flavor. It just needed to be a few degrees hotter and for me a bit spicer. I had the spinach enchiladas with the stuffed  poblano pe bed on the side. Pretty tasty and not low cal to be sure. Lotsa cheese but I was in the mood for a caloric splurge.   I could be enticed to make this a regular hang out, especially because they have trivia nights on Mondays. If they were to get bigger TVs I might just spend my Sundays here come football season.  Could have hung out here for a few more hours but alas, it's nap time!"}
{"text":"Spokes is a great place for a beer and some surprisingly good food.  The have a rotating monthly beer special that is now $4 anytime for a select pint and happy hour is always a good time.   Trivia night is usually pretty fun and really gives me that dive bar feeling."}
{"text":"\"Let's meet at Spokes!\" She crooned. As soon as the words came out of my friend's mouth, I was devastatingly disappointed.  But since I was pressed for time, I went along with her lame suggestion.  I've been there once before and my experience was more like 'don't care to return.\" So, how about a reluctant second chance? No better.  Spokes looks great on the outside, even inviting.  That is until you step in the inside.  It's a large, woody place with a distinct scent. And the waitstaff, let's just say, they have low expectations for tips. As for me, going once was too many times."}
{"text":"I'm traveling here for work and decided to try my hand at what appeared to be a well reviewed restaurant.  Before I dive in with my breakdown, the only additional detail I want to add is I ordered via the GrubHub app and the delivery was quick compared to other places I've ordered from.  My order consisted of Turkey Sliders and the two popular items, SOS Queso and Build Your Own Burger.  The turkey sliders were quite good.  I've never had a curry slaw before and I would certainly order it again.  I was looking forward to the SOS Queso.  I read and heard good things about the dip and just reading it from the menu made my mouth water.  As I am someone who loves a little spice in my life, I decided to go extra spicy.  When I received my food, I found the appetizer to be not at all what I was expecting.  If you are familiar with opening up a can of Rotel and mixing it with a block of melted Velveeta, then this dip is for you.  As we know what happens when you make that cheese dip, it hardens rather quickly and I considered myself lucky that I had a microwave to re-melt the dip in...I pity those poor patrons at the tables in the restaurant.  As far as the dip being \"extra spicy,\" they might as well have poured a little bit of Tapitio hot sauce on top of it, because judging by the looks, taste, and smell of it that's exactly what they did.  Highly disappointed.  There were a fair few burgers to choose from so I decided to build my own.  I love my burgers with a bit of pink and in the instance of the build your own, you are allowed two toppings, having to pay for any additional toppings.  I decided to go with bacon, pepper jack cheese, and pay the little bit extra for a 3rd topping, caramelized onions.  When I received my burger, I was happy to find I had bacon and a pink center, but that's where my happiness ended.  The cheese was not pepper jack but provolone.  Additionally, I was given raw onions as well as two big slices of tomato, a topping I didn't even ask for nor do I care for and generally ask to leave off.  I can understand the burger coming with lettuce, which this one did, and I don't mind...however...when I see on a menu that a burger comes with tomatoes, I always ask they not be included and nowhere under the \"BUILD YOUR OWN\" does it indicated such a topping is automatically included.  If it were, then why is tomatoes and option under the toppings?  Needless to say, based on the fact that I received a very generic and overpriced burger as well as very generic and overpriced Velveeta/Rotel dip with some Tapito poured on top, I was not happy with having to pay as much as I did for what actually can be called a good tasting meal.  The food itself was good, but for the price you are paying, be cautious."}
{"text":"Eh. Nothing special. Cool bar scene I guess. Chicken Tenders are definitely better than average."}
{"text":"This place has tasty food and has plenty of options for vegetarians. The atmosphere is fun for large or small groups but can be too loud at times. They have a \"sit anywhere\" policy which is nice but tend to not see or forget about people on the porch but you're likely to get a free appetizer out of the frequent slip up. If you're not a smoker be careful of the porch."}
{"text":"Soo far we have tried the pepper burger, 9.50 not with it!  The side if waffle fries are excellent. We had the farmers fry basket, appetizer,  the basket was good but again not worth the 9.50 price.  We were not told ahead of time, that the iced tea is brewed with \" flowers\" , not my favorite.  We were not informed that Saturday all day is happy hour.  While waiting for drinks I noticed the menu for happy hour on the table.  I ordered wings, mild.  Soooo ordinary!  Nothing spectacular here. Best thing was the Groupon."}
{"text":"Salmon was perfect, sweet potato-stuffed poblano was a little strange. But great atmosphere and great service! I'd come back ;)"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! First time here. Bartender attentive and quick with service. Food is creative and FRESH! Loved the bruschetta and the wings. Craft beer and a nice atmosphere make this the perfect place to hang out."}
{"text":"Salmon salad is delicious. Turkey sliders are delicious. Friendly, fast service, phenomenal outdoor seating (equipped with a koi pond, ducks, and bridges just off the large porch)."}
{"text":"First time at this local bar. It was too hot to sit on the patio for us today, but found a great seat and had an awesome server. Very attentive and made good recommendations. Good happy hour food and beer selections. Turkey tacos were good, on the lighter side and cheap! Happy hour food is $3.99 and $1 off beers. Also had chips & queso, my husband had hot wings that he said were tasty, but could have used a little more sauce. He also had the southwest turkey sandwich meal that he liked. Good grub for a local pub. The food was above average..maybe a 3.5.. But the service bumped up my review. Good food and prices, comfortable & clean environment topped off by great service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar and grill. Food is always fresh and great selection. And the rotating taps of various craft beer is fantastic."}
{"text":"The bartender here was super nice and funny.  He gave me great service and kept checking in on me, he was super friendly.  For lunch I ordered a salmon sandwich.  It was kind of weird because the salmon was fat and round, like a ball.  So you can imagine how awkward it would be to eat a ball in the middle of two slices of bread.  It was good, I love salmon, I just think they could have chose a thinner cut.  They had an excellent selection of craft beers and I think I may have over heard the bartender saying at least one was a nitro beer, oh yum.    I've been back several times with friends and the servers are hit or miss.  The selection of beer is excellent though."}
{"text":"Nice place. Will be back for happy hour. I had a speciality Burger and delish. Burger had advocado, pepperjack cheese, crispy onions and spicy aioli.  Went for lunch and not too busy. Nice atmosphere and cool patio."}
{"text":"This place is great! Easy going place that has games and great wings. Their Happy Hour is really good and they even have a trivia night during the week. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I've been to Spokes twice now, and both times it has been a great experience!! Last weekend, my husband and I biked up to Spokes for our first outing. There are places all over the restaurant and patio to lock up your bike, being a bike-themed restaurant. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the lovely afternoon. Kyle was our server, and we was always around making sure we had enough to drink, that our food was ok, etc. Just really friendly staff, but not overbearing. My husband had the turkey sandwich, which to his surprise was real carved turkey, not pressed deli meat. I had the smoked salmon Blt, which was delicious!! The waffle fries are amazing.  The next trip we sat in the dining room, and I really like the ambience of the place. The beer menu had been updated since our last visit (they rotate through kegs of craft beer, but there is always Bud light on the menu for the less adventerous). They also keep a cider on tap, which is awesome. Right now it is Sam Adam's Angry Orchard cider, which isn't my favorite, but still better than no cider at all. This time around I tried the shrimp tacos with a side salad, while Matt had the Salmon BLT, again both of us enjoyed our meals, and we had Kyle as our server again, so the service was fantastic. I haven't tried any desserts yet, but I'm looking forward to that on my next trip!  It is so nice to have a local restaurant within biking/walking distance of my neighborhood with good food (not typical bar food), and a great craft beer selection."}
{"text":"Our first visit was on a Saturday at lunch time.  Our initial impression was that it hopefully looks better in the dark because in the light, it's pretty rough.  It took awhile to get an ice water.  We placed our orders before water was brought to the table and my husband had to remind the waiter that he ordered iced tea.  We tried the queso which was extremely thick, much like under heated Velveeta.  We also tried the breaded cauliflower in wing sauce.  We chose medium sauce.  It was like steamed cauliflower in wing sauce, not great.  The burgers were good.  The grilled cheese was good.  The waffle fries were good.  The sweet potato fries were a bit soggy, no crispy crunchy outside.  The ranch was tasty.  We were given no refills on water.  We have so many choices here, we won't return to such an average place."}
{"text":"I've already left a review for Spokes but I feel compelled to leave another. I frequent this bar and love it. The tap selection chosen by Jerome is always on point with so many different options. The staff are friendly and always trying to help accommodate. Lindsey (the bartender during the week) is always welcoming with a great smile and great liquor pours! Sometimes they get super busy (for good reason) but most of the time the service is prompt and the atmosphere is relaxed! A Great place for parties!  The food is always awesome (if you like snacking try the wings or chips and queso during happy hour! It's only $4). They have darts and ping pong which I like to play with my friends. Last but not least the patio is spacious and open, with great heaters and fire tables for the winter months! Lynessa the manager is always happy to help so don't be afraid to ask! If you don't like this place you don't understand what a great local bar is about! I feel like I should mention all the other great wait staff and bartenders like Scotty, Brian, Matt, Sean, Tessa, Justine, Cari and all the others!"}
{"text":"Good food the service was a little excessive at least 5 different servers came up to our table, but we did enjoy our experience."}
{"text":"Spokes is one of my favorite go-to spots when I want to ride my bike up to a place with a great patio, cold beer, and delicious food. The staff here is incredible and they are always friendly and engaging. Not to mention, they have a monthly beer that they keep on special all month! This place is great and I highly recommend it for the atmosphere. If you want to play bots games - they've got them. Trivia? They have it. A fun kids area? Yeah, they have that, too! If you haven't been to Spokes, give it a try because you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Decent craft beer selection. They had a porter that I've never tried. Yummy bloody marys. The decor and the vibe reminds me of a place that could be located somewhere up in the mountains. The Caesar salad had a nice touch with the sautéed red bell pepper and dressing. The steak burrito was really delicious. I'd return!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed to have a (less than) mediocre experience at Spokes On Southern after reading a lot of great reviews on it. We decided to try it out on a Saturday afternoon because the weather was gorgeous and we wanted to sit outside - Spokes' patio area is rather plain, but overlooks a nice little lake with some very social turtles and ducks. We sat ourselves (per the instructions on the welcome sign) and waited several minutes before a server greeted us.   Saturdays have an \"all-day happy hour\" special, so we ordered a soft pretzel with queso from the happy hour menu. It took quite a while to arrive at our table (10+ minutes after we put our entree orders in), and I was pretty disappointed when it arrived. It looked and tasted like one of the frozen pretzels you buy from the grocery store, and the queso was rubbery. I think it was $5, so you get what you pay for, I guess...but it wasn't even worth that.   Our entrees were also underwhelming - I had the fish tacos, which had no taste. The flour tortillas seemed stale and powdery, and the fish tasted like it had been microwaved from frozen. My boyfriend had the Carver burger, which he said had little flavor, as well. We both had fries (I had regular waffle fries, he had sweet potato fries), and they were decent. However, the table behind us ordered a side of fries and we overheard them tell the server that they had arrived cold. Hmm...  Overall, Spokes seems like a better place to grab drinks and bar food than to enjoy a meal - I saw on their website that they have a trivia night, so maybe I'll try it again for one of those events."}
{"text":"Solid beer food, great beer choices, cool atmosphere. This is the second time I was here and the first time I tried the food.  We got Turkey Pesto (great!) and the Turkey bacon enchiladas. (Also great). They do have a kids area (not sure this is a place to bring your kids to begin with) but why discriminate? Bring 'em!  Overall great place.     Cheers!"}
{"text":"Patio dining near a pond was dog friendly. Plenty of gluten free options are available. Interesting variety of burgers.  Eg shredded turkey on a cheeseburger. Sweet potato fries are standard, not an up charge. Service was slow, waiter neglected to have silverware on table when food arrived, and delayed bringing condiment. Worth a visit when you are in the area and want a bit of local fare and a brew."}
{"text":"Came in last night for a late night bite. Enjoyed outdoor seating and even saw the pretty ducks by the pond! Service was god awful, the entire time we were waiting. Waiting for a server to greet us, waiting for our server to take our order, waiting for the server to get our check.   They do have some pretty delicious beer. If you like fruity and sweet check out the watermelon ale and the pineapple passion fruit cider. Yum! Food was nothing special. Snag a Groupon, sit outside and drink some yummy beers!   Wouldn't come back for the food...or without a Groupon :)"}
{"text":"Best bar ever. Came in on a Saturday night, there were two hotties behind the bar. Lindsey and Lauren, I call them L squared. These girls had the best hair I've seen in years. I ordered turkey sliders and let me say... Ya don't need no teeth to eat that meat! I recommend this bar for anyone looking for a good time. Can you dig it?"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a great salmon blt that I get without the 'b'. Their waffle fries are killer - they'll do a mushroom cap burger that is REALLY good. Annnd bruschetta is really good there.   Good service and good food. Nothing to dislike."}
{"text":"I've been to Spokes twice now & haven't had a glimpse of disappointment!   They have 24 beers on tap- and a great informational beer list to match (in case you like to know exactly what you are ordering.) I love beer but I also like surprises. Both times I've been I have had super friendly & knowledgable servers who have helped me choose random beers that would please my palette. There is definitely a beer for everyone... who likes beer. We took my anti-beer best friend and explained her situation as she looked over the menu- immediately, they brought her a couple of samples hoping to find one she liked. When she wasn't pleased with any of them (crazy girl) they brought her a fun & creative tequila drink. It was very sweet!  We decided we were hungry and thought we would give their affordable food a try. I was surprised by some of the poor food reviews, because everything we had was very flavorful, well made, and unique! (It is still a new restaurant, so you have to give them some room to work out the kinks- but I think they are doing well & are open to hearing customer opinions.) I had the sirloin tacos with a side salad. The balsamic dressing was delicious and my salad was super fresh. When my two tacos came out, I wasn't sure if it would be enough food.. but they were packed full of goodness! They came with chimchurri and poblano peppers, and they weren't spicy- but moist and full of flavor! My light eating friend ordered edamame, and was given the choice of having it served salted or with pesto. Yum! My other friend got the Caprese sandwich and sweet potato fries, both of which she was very pleased with.   The decor and atmosphere inside are cute. It's bike themed with an at home, neighborhood bar feel. Outside is adorable! Especially with the great weather we are currently having :). It's covered, well lit, and overlooks a little baby lake I didn't even know was there. Also, they have happy hour all day on Saturdays- so who can go wrong with that? We enjoyed our Saturday evening there.  I had 2 craft beers I'd never tried before and plenty of food & my tab was only $17. The service was quick, down to earth, and full of jokes for our increasingly silly table.   Give Spokes a try- unless you hate beer and friendly faces you won't be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in on a whim for a late lunch, and boy were we impressed! We were one of five people in the restaurant, but I love how spacious it is. I wish I could remember the name of our server and compliment him personally!! He was phenomenal. Sat down with us and told us about the history of Boulders and Spokes and was very relaxed with us. Then our food came. Talk about creative and delicious plates! The happy hour dishes were smaller, of course, but it was enough to fill us up! And the back patio. Beautiful! Couldn't of picked a better spot for lunch. Definitely plan on returning soon!!"}
{"text":"I was extremely unhappy with the treatment I received at Spokes. I was in town visiting with a friend and after only 2 hours of relaxing on the patio and having a couple drinks, we were told that we were not allowed to continue to drink. The company I was with are all responsible young adults and did not disrupt anyone or cause any sort of trouble. I was extremely disappointed because the food and waitress were very good throughout the evening until this all happened with the bartender (who had not even spoken to us) and the manager (who did nothing to investigate why we were asked to no longer eat or drink) overall, I would not recommend going to a restaurant like this. Go Cats. Meow ."}
{"text":"When my husband and I moved within walking distance to Spokes on Southern, we figured it would be our neighborhood bar.  I am sad to say that due to repeated episodes of bad service, that will not be happening.   The first time we tried this place, it was right before Halloween.  The bartender dressed as Duff Man was really nice and knowledgeable about the beer.  He is the one breath of fresh air that we have experienced here.  The next two times, we walked our dog to the patio, hoping to enjoy a pint before the walk home.  Both times, we were neglected by the servers for very long periods of time.  The second time, we waited 10 minutes just to order a beer.  We asked for just a few more minutes while we decided if we wanted something to eat.  Thirty minutes later, the server comes back to ask us if we've decided.  Yeah, we decided about 20 minutes ago when you completely disappeared that we no longer wanted anything else because no server was anywhere to be found.    The servers act as though the patio is an afterthought.  I don't know if they pull double duty and serve inside and outside at the same time, but if that's the case, it isn't working.  A few servers should probably be stationed outside because the service on the patio is severely lacking."}
{"text":"I discovered this place on Yelp as part of my research for craft beer-serving restaurants near our hotel. We've been to Four Peaks brewing. We've been to San Tan Brewing. I enjoyed both but for our very quick, less-than-24hour-trip, we hoped to find something close to the hotel with a menu that didn't mirror standard bar fare.  And did we find it! We wandered in to see a sign that said \"seat yourselves\" so we found 2 great spots at the bar and settled in. Our fabulous tender of the bar was David who quickly made it known that despite him being busy, he was there for us and that we were going to get along great. And we did. Fun conversation and camaraderie aside, David knew all there was to know about their beer list. Including all the specialty sours on tap. Now, I'm an IPA fan. But after a tiny taste of the Sour Gose, I was intrigued. I ordered another sour which was red in color. As David put it, it would be a cocktail to enjoy especially if I was a red wine drinker. Milder in sour-aspect and bright berry flavors. For sure! It was exactly that in a way I can't even describe. I even went back and ordered the Gose.   David spoke very highly of the menu and their chef and explained that they roast all their turkey in house as well as make all their sauces. My husband and I ordered the Farmer's Fry Basket to start which was a delicious combination of fried okra, fried green beans (the best!), corn fritters, spicy pickles and cheese curds served with a spicy aioli and a cool tzatziki. The green beans were seriously the best I've ever had with the perfect amount of batter.    Next we decided to share the turkey street tacos, which I had seen pictures of here on yelp. It came with a side David suggested that we choose the poblano that was stuffed with a sweet potato mash and bacon with the spicy aioli. Wow. All I can say is yum! The roasted turkey was moist and flavorful with cranberries and fried sweet potato shavings on top. A perfect flavor and texture combination. I had mine in a corn tortilla whereas my husband had flour. We each enjoyed our tacos and the stuffed pepper was fab as well. The pepper itself had some nice heat to it which you don't always get in poblanos. The mash and bacon was a perfect combo and we would order it all again.   The next time we visit the Phoenix/Tempe area, we will definitely be back to explore more of the menu and craft beers!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Great food, nice atmosphere, and server Brian was one of the best servers I've ever had."}
{"text":"We came here with a Groupon and was pleasantly surprised! Angie was our server and she was great! The restaurant is older as it used to be a sports bar called Sneakers but the decor is cute with all of the bike stuff. Bikes are allowed inside the restaurant and you can even lock them up! They even have some games like darts, etc. The menu wasn't huge but had a lot of different options. We learned that most of the foods were local and we will have to come back for their specialty, a roasted stuffed poblano pepper. We ordered their medium wings as an appetizer and they were your basic fried crispy hot wings but were delicious nonetheless. I ordered the roasted turkey sandwich with a gluten free bun and a side salad. Both were good! My boyfriend got a made to order burger with bacon and he thought it was great but a little pricey. The only thing we would change is to offer a lunch menu/discount on some of the food items during lunch time as a sandwich and burger for $10 is a little much but since we had to use our Groupon, we didn't mind. Also, the porch is dog-friendly and they offer an interesting brunch every Saturday and Sunday. Happy Hour Mon-Thursday!"}
{"text":"This is the most overpriced and mediocre restaurant I've ever eaten at. Just for example, it's a bit over $10 for TWO measly tacos...and another $2 to add a third. The steak in the tacos was so over cooked I could barely even bite through it at certain points. Not to mention it takes forever for the food to be prepared, even when there's not a single other person in the restaurant (which is most of the time). I've also ordered the TWELVE DOLLAR southwest chicken salad, which I was pretty excited for until I realized it was a $12 plate of lettuce, with about as much corn, beans, chicken, and cheese a person could pinch with 3 fingers buried underneath. Seriously, I had to search pretty hard for the other ingredients. In conclusion, spokes has slow service, poorly cooked food, and drastically overpriced food. The only upside is that the employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"A BIG WOW! Met a friend here since it was closest to their office. Rather plain outdoor patio- however it backs up to a gorgeous little pond and water fall water feature. Got the menu and it goes from sandwiches and hamburgers to what they call southwest-ish meals. Noticed right away how veg friendly they are. Me and my lunch friend decided to do the tacos: him, the carne asada tacos on flour tortilla and I got the veggie tacos. They offer many sides to your meal even include the soup of the day. Today was vegetarian chili!! ANOTHER WOW! I asked the server about the soup and I guess the chef's here are quite the \"soup-ies\" and create something new almost daily. After eating the chili I would tell everyone to ask what the Soup of the Day is! I bet you will never go wrong. Both our meals were great, service was great and peaceful pond view made this a perfect lunch!  Check out Spokes! Try the soup!"}
{"text":"Food all tasted frozen and or stale- chicken wings were undercooked and had way too much sauce. Pretzel was rock hard and dessert was just gross. Was excited for a neighborhood bar to open but very disappointed in service and type of food. Even the beer selection is sub par."}
{"text":"Spokes has the best fries, beer, and servers! Our server tonight was so knowledgeable and patient as well as the other servers I've had. If you want to sit back and chill with great fries and great beer Spokes is the place."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! I was told the food was great for bar food, but I think it could be better. I had a bacon pear grilled cheese. The bread didn't have the crunch I was looking for and the pear was not ripe :(  Love, love, love that they have sours on tap!!!"}
{"text":"Watched the ASU game here with friends on Saturday.....and I remember \"Sneakers\" that this was previously.  Really liked the \"Spokes\" theme - Bicycles are so in right now and there was done of fun people watching as Tempe had its Tour De Fat that day!  The food here was very good, beer selection was great, pricing was reasonable, and service staff was solid!"}
{"text":"I have been coming into spokes for a while now. I have looked passed them fudging up orders, having hazardous plastic material in my food, and not having patrons/frequent patrons served in a timely manor. I don't care if I come in at 10 am or 1:30 am I should get the same service! And for the most part that happens. But when I come in on Tuesday night and the karaoke host's friends are there.... You better believe they will get what they want before the rest of the bar, whether it be drinks or songs. I am very upset with the establishment and the karaoke company they employ. This is not the first time that I have come to spokes and been denied a song.  Although we spend a lot of money at spokes, I don't believe I will be in to 'say hi' for a while.  And if I could find the karaoke company's yelp page I would have a lot more to post. But I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"Only reason not two stars is its a neighborhood place, and they have good food. Service, horrible. Third time in 4 weeks, tables less than half occcupied, and wait 1 l5 minutes for someone to say hi, let alone bring a beer."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night, it was trivia night so pretty crowded.  I like the patio but sat at the bar.  Ordered the Carne Asada, pretty tasteless and dry.  Wings are good.  Service was ok, food came out fast.  Would probably frequent here and there and not expect much.  Beer selection is good and reasonable."}
{"text":"Interesting, very cool decor.  Waitress was very quick to greet us and get our drink orders.  Menu is small with some rather odd choices but substitutions or subtractions are allowed.  Pretzel and cheese was yummy, and enough for two to share.  Hamburger was grilled perfectly and tasty.  Waffle fries were crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  Overall, a good meal!"}
{"text":"Got lunch on a Saturday and the place is packed! Matt took great care of me, service with a smile. This place rocks! Great food every time"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place with good food. It's got a really casual, chill vibe. The food is good, but I didn't really have anything to rave about. The portion sizes are pretty large so that kinda makes up for it. I debated between 3 or 4 stars just because the wait time is crazy slow. Our server was pretty good and Maybe it was a one off situation where they were just really understaffed that day. Plus it was trivia night so super packed. Overall good place to catch up with friend or catch the game."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Had the sliders. Fries are tasty. However, the non-smoking porch has a group of guys smoking both tobacco and ecigs. No one stored them. Took the enjoyment of the food away being down wind. Also against the law but there were ash trays on the tables right under the no smoking signs so the mixed message was there. Folks had dogs on the patio as well. Interesting menu but not really my taste. If you like all the trendy type food, probably a great place for you."}
{"text":"I'm happy to say that I returned last night to Spokes and had their spinach kale enchiladas with beans and rice, and I was very pleased with the quality of the food! I'm glad that they added another vegetarian option to the menu, and it was delicious. Haven't returned to the other food items that I disliked last time, but maybe during my next visit. Thanks, Spokes!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, decent beer selection, really great location with a lot of greenery and it's very open.  I tried the grilled cheese with sweet potato fries, bbq hot wings, and the salted caramel creme puff. The sweet potato fries were perfect - which isn't always the case in restraunts since the sweet potato fad hit - and the hot wings were also very good. The grilled cheese was super tasty and I chose avacado and bacon as my two topping selections along with a base blend of cheeses. The only thing that bummed me out was that the dessert was prepackaged - the server explained that they were running out of them because the supplier discontinued that dessert - but this isn't Applebees, so I expected the desserts to be made fresh! Very disappointing.  They had a lot of turkey-based items (tacos?!) which I found pretty unique."}
{"text":"Nice staff, green quesadillas is wonderful! Great daily selections of beers on tap!!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here for happy hour on a Friday afternoon after work. It is a self seating restaurant, and luckily we were able to find a place to hold our group. There were areas that could hold large parties, but there were two or three people that had occupied the space.  Anyway our server helps me find the place where we ended up sitting, then disappears. Doesn't come back for over 15 mins to take our drink orders. By then we all knew what we wanted to ear, so we placed our orders. Our food took a while, but it came out and they had forgotten something on everyone's meal, including all the dipping sauces. So of course we ask for everything and it takes another eternity for it all to come back. I had the boneless wings with Jerk seasoning. Y'all! These things were dried out and barely had any seasoning on them! But I was hungry and it's chicken on happy hour, so why not!  So we must have gotten our food about 6:30PM... Happy hour ends at 7PM. Our server never came back to ask if we wanted anything before happy hour was over - like is customary anywhere else that has happy hour. This woman comes back at 7:02PM (realized after the fact) and asks if we want anything. When I proceed to ask for the boneless wings (on the happy hour menu), she doesn't say anything. When I get my check, this woman done charged my happy hour price for one order of dried out wings (cool) and more than double the price for the second order. And she proceeds to tell me \"oh happy hour was over 2 minutes before you ordered.\" Y'all! When I tell you I had to grit my teeth to keep my composure! I didn't fuss. Paid for my food. They took ANOTHER eternity to bring our checks/cards back. A different woman brings them back, tosses the stack of them on the table, whirls around and leaves without saying a word. We all look at each other like *insert your own form of profanity here.*   This place is one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. The service was appalling, the food was below sub-par, and it is definitely not worth what they charge you for. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with fish tacos and these tacos are really good here. The only thing I would add it's just a sauce on top but they are good overall. Sweet potatoes fries are super yummy and adult beverages are on point. Good service  Big patio Clean Cool music  I recommend it"}
{"text":"Great burgers here and a nice beer list to match. I appreciate a side salad offered as an option instead of fries.  The other entrees on the menu received good reviews from my crew.  The all-day Saturday happy hour is a nice bonus.   The patio overlooks a nice lake with a walking path around it, and expect the friendly ducks to come begging for food.  If inside is more your thing, there are plenty of tables to choose from.   I plan to be back to this place!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place.  Awesome friendly bar tenders.  The food is great!  The beer is always great!  Try the Turkey Quesdilla it's delish!  Bells Two Hearted on tap.  Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"Great pub...Always a great selection of rotating taps, including some locals. The food is good pub food, but everyone comes for the beer and patio (when weather is nice). Staff is very friendly and efficient. Stop by after work at least once a week for a few ice cold pints."}
{"text":"The food is their biggest downfall. Quit trying to be so unique and focus on doing something right. Even mediocre bar food would be a huge improvement for this place. We went during their grand opening week and were seated right by two roll up doors even after telling the hostess we didn't want to sit outside (it was quite cold that evening) so we had to ask the server later to close the doors for us. Queso dip appetizer was probably the most boring I've ever had. Food took forever, my burger was simply meh. My wife's tacos were seasoned with a crazy amount of some oily concoction and the meat was tough and chewy. I had to send my cold fries back.   We waited a couple weeks to let them settle in and didn't have much better luck. This time the server was indifferent bordering in rude. I had pulled turkey sliders (seasoned with barbecue sauce and curry?!?!?!) on a soggy pretzel bun and my wife got the mediocre burger.   Beer selection is great and will probably keep me coming back occasionally for some late night libations. I wouldn't mess with anything else. It's sad/scary when I think I could legitimately do a better job cooking/coming up with the menu."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here a while back to celebrate a bon voyage for a good friend of ours we got the the server recommended bruschetta board and chased it down with some tasty brews. Good beer selection, food selection is healthier oriented pub grub and the atmosphere feels like young professional/grad school. Apparently they just opened and it was pretty populated. Will have to return for more  food!"}
{"text":"We went here Thursday night for dinner around 7. My bf had the wings, I got the stuffed poblano and bruscetta planks. The bruscetta was not good. The standard cheese basil tomato one was ok, though the cheese had been sitting at room temp so long it was mushy. The turkey one was cold and very dry and hard to eat, and the pear one had extremely unripe pear. The caramelized onion on it was ok and we tried it without the pear, but I don't love eating straight onion on bread. I am not sure how you miss pear being that unripe, it was crunchier than an apple, it would have had to be like cutting through a carrot. Fyi spokes, that's not what pears are supposed to like. The poblano was tasty, but cold. Slightly below room temperature. Not what I expect when I order something that's roasted. The cheese had congealed on the top, and there was barely any filling. The wings were ok, if a little bland. The waitress didn't come back to check on us for quite some time so we ate it anyway, we were really hungry. We will never be back, that was the most disappointing meal I've had in a very long time.  I'm not sure how there's so many great reviews for this place..."}
{"text":"Spokes is a nice restaurant! It looks like a typical and big box place from the outside but the patio area was fun. We opted to take in the beautiful weather on a picnic table outside. Love that there's a small lake and ducks milling around, there were also pigeons flying above which could be startling at times.  I've been here once before and sat inside which was fine, but sitting outside was great save for all the cigarette smoke. I ordered cauliflower wings from their happy hour menu, which are lightly fried and come with your choice of dressing (ranch or blue cheese) and wing sauce, and I picked hot. They were good, just wish they were hotter in temperature. And they only came with one carrot stick and two celery stalks, lol.   Service was good and attentive, and we enjoyed our time here."}
{"text":"Living a block away, I can definitively say that Spokes On Southern is a great place to hang and drink a beer. They have a lot of beers on tap, and the price during Happy Hour are pretty nice too (they also have Happy Hour from 10pm-2am, that's a big plus!) We came around 10pm on a Thursday night and the patio was pretty full. I was able to bring my puppy since it was pet friendly.  The only downside to this place is that it took a while to get the menu, we sat ourselves since we came straight from the parking (because of the dog). The table was dirty (plates and glasses). But the waitress was very nice and efficient.  We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend came here on a Monday during happy hour. Not exactly the most exciting time but still it was surprisingly empty; especially considering it was only an hour away from Team Trivia. While the beer selection was pretty good with about 20 taps or so; the food was not. We got the pretzel, which we use as a kind of standard guide and it did not pass. It was like the frozen pretzels you get at Walmart, and it was kind of cold, and the cheese was bad too. So overall, very plain and nothing special going on. Especially with all the many bars and hot spots in Tempe, this place would not be on my top list."}
{"text":"This visit was much better than the previous. Service was fairly prompt, and it was followed up by the bartender and another server.   Our server this particular evening was new, but she was friendly, courteous and efficient. Her timing was a bit off and she wasn't familiar with the menu but she was quick with the answers to my questions, got our drinks delivered, appetizer and meal orders in to the kitchen and then delivered to the table in a timely manner. My Pumpkin Porter was perfect, thanks to the bartender.   Our appetizers was strangely good.  Go figure, cauliflower stepping in to replace chicken wings Buffalo style.  I'm a fan. Our entrees were tasty and a pleasant change from the usual.  That sweet potato, bacon and cheese stuffed Poblano topped with queso was even better than I imagined too.  Thanks to the other server that recommended it. Yum YUM!  Overall, two thumbs up."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a local place to go for a beer, and i think we've found it! The waiter was great, he was also our bartender. Food was good, beer was not only cold, but there were a lot of flavors to choose from. This building has been a lot of different restaurants, I think this one is the one that will stay!"}
{"text":"Went here 2x. The first time was when I was visiting my family for the holidays and I decided to stop by here because I had nothing else to do/nowhere else to go. The 2nd time I went here to see an old college friend.  I'm not a drinker but it seemed like this place was pretty relaxed. There's plenty of spaces to sit/lounge and it's not really crowded. It's like the place that people go to either hangout out with their friends or have a drink after work. There's karaoke but the its mostly people with horrible drunken voices getting on the mic. It's pretty laid back and somewhat \"friend-ish\" (as opposed to friendly) bc there isn't a meat market kind of vibe, but people just don't talk to strangers with ease. It seems like the beers are cheap and the bartenders are like \"whatever\" in attitude so that's a plus or minus depending on what you're looking for. I think the beers were like $4 or $5 during happy hour or reverse happy hour, or whatever. Me, I'm a \"whatever\" kind of person too, so I this place is fine with me."}
{"text":"Last two times  I've  gone my order was wrong, or looks like it was literally tossed together.  When its dead orders shouldnt be coming out wrong, and that's from someone who works in the service industry. Food haas seemed to go down hill  recently."}
{"text":"Great place. Nice craft beer selection, food with local ingredients. Try the Turkey Quesadilla! And Tyler, the bartender is so friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"a Tempe dwelling friend just introduced me to this place.  Tucked away in a strip mall (it IS Tempe...) is a gorgeous place, right next to a little pond that even has ducks that wander around. Who knew?  I'm a card carrying beer snob and this place doesn't disappoint.  Their extensive beer menu feature a wide variety of beers both local and not that would suit any taste. I even experienced a new beer. That is hard to do.  In addition to a wonderful beer menu, the food is fantastic.  We started with the stuffed poblano.  A poblano stuffed with sweet potato and beer cheese.  need I say more?    I then ordered the grilled cheese. This was amazing.  Sourdough buttered bread with four cheeses perfectly melted.  What makes this grilled cheese sammich so much more is the fact that you can order options. Options?  Tomato, onion, prosciutto, avocado, basil , sun dried tomatoes. it's a stellar sandwich and well worth the calories!  My friends dishes were also amazing and I can also highly recommend the Spokes Burger. This is a fresh, not pre pressed burger with a ton of flavor.    Bike friendly bar, tons of spots for bikes.  They also have a huge patio as well as a spacious indoor area with tons of televisions."}
{"text":"Loved this place so much I came back just a few days after going! Servers were friendly, food was good. I really enjoyed the outdoor patio and the pond. Good selection of beers on tap. Very relaxed environment!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago after a game with my teammates. We sat on the patio, which offered ample space and a good atmosphere. The waiter was well-versed in all the beers on tap and can help out with any questions. I wasn't impressed with the menu, but there is a little something for everyone. I got the turkey on ciabatta and it was good, though nothing great.   All in all this is a nice place to grab a drink, eat a little food, and converse with friends. i would not seek it out in any way nor do I see it becoming a go-to spot, but it is a good option if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Spokes since it's inception into the community and absolutely love it. The food here is phenomenal and the servers are friendly and charismatic. Lindsey is an awesome bartender who is very attentive. Cody the manager ensures that the customers are always right. David the server is excellent at making everyone happy.   Any item you purchase of the menu is fresh and scratch made, the Burgers aren't frozen, it's fresh angus beef! The salmon blt is incredible, the best thing you've eaten every time. The farmer fry basket is great especially for vegetarians, their salads are amazing.   Thank you for reading I hope you enjoy this establishment as much as I do, everytime."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The vibe and the atmosphere is perfect for any occasion! If you like sweet and tangy wings, try their smokey bourbon wings...you won't be disappointed! Friendly, attentive staff that will absolutely remember you and your orders of you become a \"regular\"! Plenty of tvs for sports peeps along with a pond view and a bicycling theme! This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there twice now. Service was fast and with great attitudes and smiles. I had a kale salad today that was fresh and really good. Sweet potato fries were also good but a bit limp. I don't know where the ice tea comes from but it was heavenly. I don't usually comment on such common items but it was very very good. My buddy had tacos and said they were great.  Great neighborhood watering hole atmosphere. Patio by the lake is very relaxing. All good."}
{"text":"Service and beer were very good but the food was not good at all-steak burrito anyway. Atmosphere and music was pretty good....expect high noise level. Very cool outside fire patio area."}
{"text":"I was contacted by Spokes this week regarding my review - they apologized, and said they do have the ping pong table, and offered me a free appetizer on my next visit as an apology. I thought that was a nice gesture, and thought I should post that here."}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio and smoking area great brunch on Sunday and kick butt bloody Marys great caprese salad and burgers sandwiches"}
{"text":"Food was not good at all and they use Texas Toast.   Kids area kind of weird for a bar. Beer was not very cold and service was slow."}
{"text":"This review is 5 star worthy. Lindsey was my bartender. Her smile will infect you with the feeling of welcomeness and her service makes your experience optimal. Great wide selection of beers and an all around great atmosphere. If you wanna try a place that's Lowkey and really reasonably priced with a too notch staff; spokes on southern is where you belong."}
{"text":"Been coming to Spokes for their happy hour.  It is a nice place with a good happy hour. Their chips and queso is amazing! I highly recommend it! Rumor has it they put IPA in it.. Super yummy!!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine wanted to meet for HH in Tempe and I randomly chose this place (although I'm pretty sure at some point someone I know had told me about it and liked it).  I thought it was really good. It's pretty laidback, and the type of place you'd feel comfortable bringing grandma & grandpa for a beer or even your kids...depending on the time of day, obviously (there's an area where there's games a few of which looked specifically for small children).   They have a really good beer selection that rotates. I believe most pints are $5 and a dollar off during happy hour.   As far as food goes, my friend and I split the queso dip and we both really liked it. I also had the turkey tacos on corn tortillas. It was shredded turkey w/cranberries, shredded sweet potato, and some sort of spicy aioli. They didn't completely knock my socks off, but they were still pretty tasty. Both these items were on the HH menu and were $3.99, which is a pretty good deal. There's about 5 or 6 items on the HH menu total. Other food items include turkey sliders & pretzels w/cheese.   The service here is good. I can't remember our waitresses name, but she was friendly and seemed knowledgeable of the beers on tap.   Also, this place has Golden Tee & Big Buck Hunter! I'll be back."}
{"text":"In Tempe, people don't go to biker bars, they go to bicycle bars. : )  Spokes serves up fresh, slightly healthier versions of your typical bar foods for a reasonable price (Less than $10).  They also offer more vegetarian options.  This is the 3rd day since their opening, and it was decently busy for a Thursday night.  The interior is pretty nice, and has various bicycle-themed accoutrements, such as a pair of silver owls made out of bicycle parts.  The bar and dining area is very spacious, and TVs line the walls.  There is a patio area which overlooks the gorgeous lake area outside, which I will definitely have to take advantage of once the weather is nicer!  They offer a wide range of beers available (20+ on the menu), as well as iced tea and soda.  A nice thing about their iced tea is they offer Stevia in their sweetener baskets.    Once we were seated, we were handed menus.  Despite it being just their third day since the grand opening, my menu was already splattered, sticky, and had a large tear on the side.  Putting aside my distaste at the sad state of my menu, I opted for the veg-head sandwich, while my husband had the carver burger.  The veg-head sandwich was decent.  It had fresh vegetables such as red bell pepper and eggplant in it, as well as fresh basil and mozzarella.  It had a sweet balsamic vinegar sauce with it.  As a whole, it did taste a little bland (Maybe it needed some more of the balsamic?) and the eggplant was tough and bitter.  I tried the carver burger, which I liked a lot better.  It was a sizable meal, with juicy, perfectly cooked to order meat, and very flavorful ingredients. The only real negative for my husband was that he felt the burger needed some more seasoning to bring out the flavor of the beef more. We both had sweet potato fries as a side, although you can also get sides such as salad, soup, or waffle fries with your order.  The sweet potato fries were awesome.  They were light, crispy, with just the right amount of seasoning.  Service was fast and friendly, and the owner came by to chat for a little bit, which I appreciated.  They offer happy hour and a reverse happy hour, and are open late until 2 A.M.    Overall, a pretty good experience here at a nice restaurant and location."}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch during the work week a few times, and based off of all of my visits, I've always been very happy and love continuing to come here for lunch. The staff is always very nice and helpful, and the food is absolutely delicious and prices are very reasonable.  There's a very nice outside patio that opens up to the beautiful duck pond area where there are waterfalls, ducks, turtles and fish.  I brought my dog with me today and they brought out a water bowl for her when they brought out the water for me, so they are also a pet friendly restaurant. 5 stars to this place without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Went here for a large group dinner (~30) a few weeks ago and I was excited as I have driven past this place but never stopped in to try it. It is a lot larger than I thought, with a nice patio space and a huge area in the back which is where our group was seated. Everything was pretty average, I had a southwestern turkey sandwich and some cider. What I can say though is that they set our server up for disaster. We had a reservation and they only assigned one server to our group, so it took about 2hrs for us to all get our food, and even then there were some issues with wrong orders. Not our servers fault , and I would hope that a smaller party wouldn't have the same wait as us, but I was surprised that they would set it up like that. Also, the music is pretty loud inside."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is 3-7 and 10pm- close Mon-Thur, 3-7pm Friday and all day Sat. Only $1 off beer. $3.99 on 5 food appetizers. Wings, Queso, Pickles, Pretzels and Turkey Sliders."}
{"text":"I have a hard time with spokes I have tried to go to this place 4 or 5 times really wanting to like it but it keeps letting me down. For such an amazing location they fail on so many levels . the service is the biggest issue though. The last two times I went I felt forgotten about. The first time we were being taken care of by the bartender in the bar are and when he got busy didnt have anyone else to help him and we had to shout at him to get our check . the second time we were on the patio I was greeted by the server and then didn't see her again for 25 min before she came back for my drink oder. Beer took another 15 minutes to come out and didn't get to order food until that time . they are either very under staffed or something else is going in and its a shame cus this place has such potential in this location"}
{"text":"Best beer selection ever! Omfg seriousness!  Go here 4 beer!  Even better atmosphere.  Over looks pond!  What!"}
{"text":"Well I stopped in to check it out. Tough location, it;'s kinda hidden. I go to a lot of bars like this. We hit the bar, it seemed friendly enough. Until I received the wrong beer. The bartender argued that it is what I ordered when in fact I was just taking her own recommendation. I don't remember her name (angel wings?) But she took the beer back and never brought me another beer. Even after my buddy said he would drink the one she brought. I had to order from the other bartender. Then service went downhill from there..... So .... make sure you verify with the bartender what you want before she pours. If the food is ok and there is nothing special about a place, then they need to have good friendly service if I'm ever coming back!"}
{"text":"Updated to 5 stars! They used to have a problem with the water tasting funky, but they fixed it.  Plus, they fixed the patio misters. Love the staff here. I visit weekly."}
{"text":"Sue and I came here to catch up and grab a bite to eat while I'm in town.  It's a bike themed ale place, and I really liked it. I don't know what it was before, but I wish this place was here when I lived in Mesa.  They have a gorgeous patio with tons of covered seating.  Sue and I sat outside before they opened and hung out for a bit. Once they opened, we went in and placed our order.  I went with the chicken strips and sweet potato fries while she went with clam chowder soup.  Our server was really nice and paid good attention to our table with our order.  We didn't feel rushed at all. Unfortunately, I was unable to try any of the beer since it was to early for me to start drinking.  From what I could tell, they had a decent enough selection and I liked that.  Place was open and airy with plenty of seating and a nice relaxed feel to it.  Overall this place is a good little spot.  Great menu, friendly staff and overall good location. Please give it a try if your on this side of town."}
{"text":"OK so I haven't gotten my food yet but the selection looks good. These days I have to eat healthy. They have a good variety of salads with meat... even a steak salad! I ordered the garden salad replaced the turkey with grilled chicken.   So here's the nice touch...I had just picked up my dog from the groomer and was hungry. I looked up places with outdoor seating and found this place. I called ahead to see if it was ok to bring my dog Desiree. The guy said of course. When I arrived I just walked directly to the patio which is right by this pond with ducks and swans. Really cool. A couple of minutes later the host brought me a glass of water AND HE BROUGHT MY DOG A BOWL OF WATER! one of the patrons came out for a smoke and actually asked if I minded if he smoked while me and Des sat there. This place has definitely got themselves a return customer!  **edit: so I sat there and ate my healthy chicken salad which was ok sized and delicious but was still hungry so I ordered some chicken wings which I found out were discounted because of happy hour... Happy hour IS ALL day on Saturdays! *chuh-ching! I wondered what my dog was so enamored with and noticed the pond was filed with big fish and even a turtle that crawled up the rock! What an awesome dinner! (No my dog didn't eat the fish or turtles lol). ***edit 10/3/15 me and my dog came closer to 1pm this time and the food was just as delicious if not better. Service was great as usual. One of these days I'm going to have to eat indoors here. It looks awesome lol..."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute disaster... Horrible food and service... Not worth even spending a single dollar... I really don't understand the 4 star review for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere and good service. We've been here a few times and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always great service and food. Recommend the chicken pesto sandwich, my friends and I get it every time we come in. Good selection of craft beers on tap. Back patio backs onto a lake with fire-pits. Inside you can bring your bike in and hang it up in the back. Also have a lounge area with games. Very kid friendly."}
{"text":"No idea why this place is rated so high. I went on a Monday, aka not a busy day, and it took FOREVER to get our food. Then we got our food and it was mediocre.  I got the pretzels, wings and burger. Nothing was not spectacular like others have reviewed. The beer was good but you can get local brews anywhere now a day. I wouldn't recommend it, you can get better burgers and beers at Applebee's."}
{"text":"Two stars for a great patio, zero stars for everything else.  Service was horrendous. Our server couldn't get one order straight and when the bills came it was apparent why, every bill in our group was wrong.  We were all laughing about it. One guy tried the tabbedout thing they have and his orders were messed up also.  Food wasn't very tasty either, the wings were overcooked, the salads were mushy. The beer list was large but all mostly entry level microbrew beers, with so many taps put a couple of out of the box beers on please."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and Great beer selection. Had a couple flavored of wings and the fried pickles. All very tasty. Great for happy hour too."}
{"text":"I heard about Spokes from a friend, and the fact that it is related to Boulders made me want to try it even more! I came here with my man to watch a Lakers-Suns game and it was a good overall experience.  The bartender was nice enough to find the game we wanted and made sure the tvs facing us had it on. Our waitress was also very nice and very helpful with beer and food selection. I was feeling adventurous and chose their pepper burger over an easy bacon cheeseburger. It had different peppers and tzatziki on it and it was a unique and fairly good choice. I would like to try something different next time, but it wasn't bad. The thing I loved most was their tomato bisque, it was rich and tasty, I was very surprised at how good it was considering my low expectations of soup at a bar. I tried some of Eric's sirloin tacos and they were pretty good. I want to come back and check out that lake view and try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"With all the great comments on Yelp on the variety of the menu, I kind of expected a more diverse menu, but it is actually kind of all the small side.  I ordered the spinach enchiladas and requested that they make them easy on the spinach and kale, more cheese, since I'm not a huge fan of spinach or kale. They did a great job.  This was a great way to force myself to eat some kale, and I actually liked it better than if it was just a cheese enchilada.  The rice and beans were actually quite good too.   The service was excellent as well. Our server had to go to the kitchen to ask a lot of questions about the menu, but then she admitted to us that she actually was sort of moonlighting here -- she is a waiter at another restaurant and is just helping out because they had a big event here this evening. I'm really glad that they did make a point to have extra wait staff, because we had no trouble getting excellent service.   Really like the overall ambiance of this place."}
{"text":"Went here after reading some reviews on yelp while in Phoenix visiting my parents. It was okay. I liked the service we got, the bar was nice and clean, they had a really inviting patio area, but the TV's were WAY too loud. It was during a football playoff game, but they were so loud we were yelling at each other across our high top in the bar.   The food was decent, it wasn't terrible just decent. The beer selection was sub par - not sure if it was just that it was the winter season, but they mostly had micro brews that were all darker in color (ambers, IPA's, porters, stouts) and didn't have a good selection of Lager's or Pilsner's to choose from. I ended up with my trusty old Stella Artois that never disappoints.   With so many places in the Phoenix area, I will most likely be checking out someplace else next time we go out."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and chose this restaurant based on Yelp reviews. We were pleased! We enjoyed the drinks and the food (kale salad, pesto turkey sandwich). The staff were very friendly. The waiter looked familiar... I decided he looked like Adam Scott. My boyfriend said he looked like if Rick Moranis and David Duchovny had a baby. If you see this, wonderful waiter, you are adorable."}
{"text":"The patio is awesome and the beer was good. The food is another story. The wings were soggy and all of our food was served cold. The queso had already started to harden when it was brought to the table. The service was mediocre at best. The server was like a deflated balloon. We asked her opinion on some food items and got a shoulder shrug and \"it's good\".  I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Love love love the carver burger with waffle fries, the stuffed poblano is amazing too!! I always get the skinny strawberry margarita and the craft beer selection is always changing and delicious a little bit of everything to satisfy any palate. All of the desserts pretty bomb too. Oh the service is always on point especially closest to the bar top."}
{"text":"First off as a beer drinker...... always a rotating selection of craft beers as the bartender lindsey who was so nice to introduce herself  tells me. Food was from scratch and as local as possible. I had the \"spokes burger\" loved the kale. They do things right here, good creativity.Brought my dog and loved the patio .All day happy hour on saturday is also legit. cool neighborhood spot, check it out this place is worth it!!"}
{"text":"So ill start with the negative. The queso was not good. It is not spicy.. they just add more gallons of siracha.  Wings excellent. Beers excellent. Service excellent. They accomodate change channels and have nbatv awesome."}
{"text":"Food sucks. No idea how anyone can rate it higher than a two. I've tried the Salmon BLT (sans the B, which I got 15 minutes later), chicken fingers (tasted like old fryer oil), queso with chips was straight up inedible, fried veggie basket was limp and soggy, other assorted apps and such. All below par. I would rather eat at Los Reyes de la Torta and then come here to drink.  Because the beer selection is good. Very good. And the servers are good too. Plus chilling with the lake ducks on the patio is a good time (when the weather isn't actively trying to destroy you).   Also, the ladies restroom can be just a tad funky smelling at times. But nowhere near the infamy of its predecessor Sneakers and Native New Yorker! Thankfully they fixed that problem!  So two star food plus four star beer is a three star experience."}
{"text":"Spokes is definitely has a small-town-neighborhood vibe, despite being part of a mini-mall off a busy road. A group of friends and I came by late on a weekend night after a long day of being outside - so we all were ridiculously thirsty and hungry! One of the guys suggested this place due to it's close location to us, and he'd heard good things about it's new ownership. I'm stoked he did!  Later in the evening it was sparsely populated and there was no host to greet. So since I drove myself, I just kind of wandered in until a few more from our group arrived and we picked out a large row of tables. A waiter immediately came up and began taking drink orders from the handful of us who'd already arrived. A few wanted to order food, and he didn't mind that he'd probably have to take a few trips to the table to get us all taken care of.   Their craft beer list is crazy long and made it a little hard to decide - thankfully the guy across from me let me try his and I went with it. I was also impressed with their menu.- lot of variety. Most of our group went with the build your own burger - cooked to how we specified - and with a side. So bomb, I seriously thought about ordering another one.   After done eating we made our way to the ping pong table & darts area - ID is required to \"rent\" them from the bar. Our waiter was totally chill about splitting the check and bringing them to us after we moved up there. Cannot wait to come back and try more beer and food!"}
{"text":"I guess I will start with not everyone likes the same places.  So though I was not impressed and more disappointed? and don't plan to ever return.  We were not the only people there, though was a lot of empty tables for a Friday evening?.   I would describe the place as the local drinking spot for sure.   Has that vibe about it, the cool patio and all that.   Also the kind of place where? the tables are sticky and they serve RC cola instead of Pepsi or coke.    But the food left a lot to be desired for us.   Wife ordered the nachos which were? lacking in quality and quantity.  Would describe it as one layer of chips with a? very un-natural orange cheese on top.  Was supposed? to have pico and sour cream on top but didn't.    I got the carne asada tacos, which were small for the price, and the meat tasted lower quality and dry.  I don't know if it was the meat or something they put in the taco but the taste was just not right.    All in all,? if you go here and you love it, power to you.   But to me and my wife, the food was overpriced and not great at all.  We would not return or recommend? it."}
{"text":"Cant express how disappointed I am with the \"one size\" serving of soup...literally half a cup at the price of a full meal.. What a shame...really should be embarrassed to charge that much."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, very helpful  / friendly server/bartender (MATT), food was average to slightly above average, but super affordable.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Was kinda bummed I couldn't get chicken and waffles because it's only a weekend brunch item, so I just got the chicken tenders and waffle fries and it was BOMB! I'm picky about my chicken and this chicken was perfect, my boyfriend also got the Southwest chicken Caesar and the grilled chicken in that was amazing as well! Will be back.... it's only 3 minutes away from our house! Blessed ;)"}
{"text":"Service: awful. It was not busy, a few groups, but nothing major. I waited 20 minutes to order a beer. Never was asked about a food order. I'll beer come back again. The staff seemed lost and untrained.  Too many good places in this area to deal with this."}
{"text":"Management has contacted me so I could voice my feedback"}
{"text":"I like the bicycle decor and ambiance. Great place to grab a meal with a friend. Their food is very good. I would highly;y recommend Bruschetta Planks, Stuffed Poblano, Caprese Salad, Pesto Turkey, and any of their tacos. If it is nice, hit up the patio."}
{"text":"What can I say...it was a restaurant? It has a pretty extensive menu and very helpful staff, but it just doesn't have that wow factor to make me or my friends visit again. I got the mushroom burger with sweet potato fries and it was exactly that. I can see this being a great place to drink in, but the food isn't something I would go out of my way for. It does have a cute little board game hutch with entertainment if you are planning on bringing kids or are a big kid yourself so that is a plus!"}
{"text":"Nice patio on a beautiful day for lunch.  Had the carne asada tacos, opted to spend the extra $2 for the 3rd.  Came with a side of chicken noodle soup.  The soup was good, but the portion was very small, not filled to even the smaller inner ring of the bowl.  It's a side, so I had no real complaints.   However, They charged me $2 extra for it, but didn't tell me ahead of time.  Waitress said it was on the menue, but removed the extra charge for me when I said I wasn't happy about it.     Food took a while to come out  and the service was pretty slow even though they weren't that busy.   The tacos were only so-so, at best.  I used to come here about a year ago and remember it being much better.  Corn tortilla was stiff and cold, meat was flavorful but had no char on it.  The goat cheese was non existent, maybe A couple of crumbs.  I have to say that the tacos were not worth the $12.50.  I'm cool with not having large portions,  in fact I prefer it as long as the food is good.   But small portions and mediocre food is a real bummer.  At least the patio was nice."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at Spokes. I had never heard of the place before but saw a couple in a local flyer and saw that they had 24 beers on tap!!! Sounded like a great place to me.  Be warned this place is not easy to find without any kind of GPS!! There are no signs for it anywhere and it cannot be seen from the street. Upon walking in we were told to seat ourselves anywhere we would like. We chose to be sit over by the bar which overlooked a beautiful patio area complete with a pond. We sat for quite some time before a waiter came over to us (about 10 min). They do have a good selection of beers (I chose the SanTan Hefeweizen) and food seemed to SOUND good. So I ordered the bacon cheeseburger.   The food literally took 40 minutes to get to us. Keep in mind this place was not busy at all. Our food was okay but nothing too impressive for the prices. I had asked for my burger medium rare and it was almost well done. The side of black beans and rice was bland and cold. At this point we were ready to leave but we had another 20 minute wait to get our check.  Overall this place could be good if they changed a few things. Great selection of beers but food is lacking. May give it another shot but doubt it."}
{"text":"I went here Sunday afternoon w/ some friends. They seemed pretty busy for only being open a couple days. My group started with the queso dip appetizer. The dip had a very delicious cheese flavor, the tortilla chips were crunchy and fresh.  While waiting for the appetizer we ordered some flights of beer. They were out of flight glasses so they ended up pouring 3 pints for the price of a flight for my friend and I ended up just getting a pint, no complaints there. The beer selection was quite nice as to be expected for a spin off of Boulders on Broadway.  Being brand new, I expected some kinks needing to be worked out and there were a few. I got the grilled cheese for my meal, excellent sandwich but I had to send the fries back because they were barely cooked. They made up for it by quickly replacing them with extra crispy sweet potato fries. Next mishap? Charging for the 2nd flight we never got. They quickly corrected the problem and went beyond redemption by 1) buying me my pint and 2) giving me a coupon for a free pint next time I stop by. Minor annoyances and they are clearly moving in the right direction.   The food prices seem to be in line with a neighborhood grill. The beer prices seem a bit cheaper than you'd find at most places (especially for craft beer, $3.50 drafts for happy hour? hell yea). Finally, a craft beer spot in my neighborhood within walking distance. I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Probably a good place normally, terrible for a gluten free diet. The options are there but they are overpriced with tiny servings - I was starving and poor when I left."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, especially the patio area is really nice. The service was perfectly fine, but the menu can be a big hit or miss. If your looking for something new and unique then you'll probably be delighted. If your looking for the usually staples, made well and tasty you might find yourself having a hard time making a decision. All choices seem normal until you read what they add. Seems like they are trying a little too hard to be different, which really isn't needed for a sport bar type spot. Ended up getting hot wings and a Cesar salad.  The salad had to be modified from the menu, just an example of how they might be trying a little too hard to be unique. Shouldn't have to modify a simple Cesar salad, at least I can't remember the last time I had to do that anywhere else. Probably won't go back, just because I don't want to have to special order everything I eat if I'm not feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend early on a Friday for lunch.  We got to pick our table since we were the only people here.  Chose a nice booth, although it was a little snug, but I liked the green light that it had. I ordered what I thought was a quesadilla, but it was really more of a wrap.  It was better than expected for bar food.  You can tell the food is fresh and cooked to order. Nothing looked like it came out of a box, which is great.  My friend had the chicken caesar salad which looked amazing as well.   The only drawbacks were that the place was hot.  I had to ask the server to turn the air cooler, there were flies bothering us the entire time and the service was slow. Other than that, it was conveniently located, in a beautiful little complex with a pond that had Koi, turtles and ducks.  When the weather cools off, I'll be back to sit outside!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite bar in the entire valley! Amazing beers always on tap that you can't find at any other bar , amazing food especially the burgers and the staff makes you feel so welcome. This is my go to place! The patio over looks the water and is dog friendly ! This is a hidden gem!!!!"}
{"text":"What a fun place! From the outside, Spokes looks like a big 'box' restaurant... you know... like Cheesecake Factory or something. But inside, it has a lot more unique character. A friend and I came for happy hour, at which they have a dollar off pints amongst other food/drink specials. They have many beers on top of all varieties. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the beer and helped us choose one we would like. I didn't get to try the food, but it sounded like typical bar food. I would return!"}
{"text":"Came in last night for probably my 5th or so visit here since they opened. Sad to say i continue to find the overall experience lackluster at best. It looked like the menu had changed from my previous horrific dining experience here with basically unedible and horribly overcooked food when they first opened...so I went for a happy hour special. Pretzel and beer cheese? Sure I'd been in for beers since then, but I'd always hesitated to order anything to eat. But I have a soft spot for pretzels and cheese!! Sounds great! Sadly, it was another huge let down. The pretzel was clearly store bought and soggy with a sad off-white color to it like they didn't even bother cooking it to the specifications on the box it came in, the beer cheese was not much better. I appreciate that they appreared to have made the cheese, however it started to congeal after about 30 seconds, the joys of Velveeta. Sure it was a happy hour deal, but it was gross and shouldn't have been served like that.   The waitress, while friendly was really uneducated when it came to beer and seemed to be either unaware or just oblivious to the fact that there was a beer event and special beer tapping happening for beer week. She took one person's order and then didn't come back for 20 minutes while everyone eagerly waited to get their chance to order the specialty beer. I really don't find this place to be a fun place to hangout and have beers and don't recommend it, I have given it several shots and came up empty everytime."}
{"text":"I've been to spokes a few times with friends and overall this is a good restaurant. There are some really good things about it and some things that I'm not a fan of.  PROs The atmosphere is great.  They have a beautiful patio with lots of shade that overlooks pond with fish and ducks.  The food is good.  Almost everything I've ordered there has been delicious.   They have a huge beer selection that always offers variety.  CONs Their beer selection is constantly changing.  I'm a creature of habit so it's frustrating when I find a beer that I really like they don't offer that beer the next time I'm there,  I think it would be nice if they had a few regular beer selections.  The food is pretty expensive for the portion size.   Our server had a really bad attitude.  Each time I came to the restaurant I sat on the patio and the server always seemed to be in a bad mood.  I understand that serving is not an easy job and everyone has a bad day every now and then but its a bummer to have the server consistently be in a bad mood."}
{"text":"I went to Spokes for a ladies night with my friends. We like to try a new place each time we go out together. The place we were planning to try was closed and I had just heard about Spokes the night before, so we decided to try it. We had a great time hanging out on the patio. There are Adirondack chairs! The patio overlooks a man-made pond too, which is lovely. I love that we didn't feel separated from the rest of the place just because we were outside, since there is a wall-sized opening from the inside to the patio. The service and the food were both great. I had the kale burger with curry slaw, bunless since I am gluten intolerant. If you're a fan of sweet potato fries, you'll be happy to know you can get them here.   The only thing I wasn't in love with was our table, because it was incredibly wobbly. Easy fix, but that means someone actually has to notice and stop to fix it. Please check your tables for wobbliness, Spokes! Thank you. :)  Oh, and If you want soup, don't go on Sundays. Soupless Sundays. I don't know what that's about, but...no soup for you.  I can't speak to the beer or alcohol selection because I didn't imbibe on that evening, but I'll definitely be back to check it out again soon. I can tell this will be a new hang-out spot for me."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice Saturday lunch with some friends. The bartender was funny and witty, very helpful in the beer & food selection. My  friend and I each got an order of Sirlion & Shrimp tacos so we could have one each. I will say the tzatziki sauce was awesome on it, a nice twist to tacos but i wouldn't say the meat and shrimp were the best I've  ever had. I also was excited to try a new food ... Yes, I've never had pablano peppers before and did so stuffed with mashed sweet potatoes .... now that was YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend. They chose it because I absolutely love grilled cheese and will pretty much order it anywhere it's offered.  I was not disappointed.  You get 3 cheeses on the grilled cheese if I remember correctly there are 3 base cheeses. I remember there is cheddar and blue cheese.  Then you get to pick 2 extra toppings from a very delicious list.  I chose bacon and sweet onions...it's was absolute perfection! I got the sweet potato fries, they were good but a little soft, next time I plan on trying the waffle fries.  For an appetizer we got the beer queso spicy style and it was soooo gooooddd.  It's been a long time since I've had good queso and this one was delicious!  The wait staff was really nice, explained things and were passionate about the things being served."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor. Suck it up and go to Four Peaks.   This place  has sports bar food, á la  Zips, with moderate pricing, like Z Tejas.  We asked for freshly made margaritas, this order was explicitly made. Our forgetful server brought us horrible margarita mix drinks. When we complained, her solution was to offer coupons for a next visit. There will not be a future  visit.  The food we ordered was decent but not worth the prices. What a letdown."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop by after work and grab a draft beer. The beer is great, the food needs work. Still a great spot."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars - these guys sling a lot of hash and ale. The place is easy to find, just West of McClintock on the North side of Southern.  There is inside and outside dining, separate rooms for those who need it a little quiet. Bar has stools and tables. A variety of amazing Turkey choices. We had the Turkey Quesadilla on a spinach tortilla.  Super! Turkey tacos were terrific, especially enjoyed the stuffed green pepper side (waffle fries were a hit with the grand kids). Daughter quite enjoyed her turkey pesto sandwich.  Wife liked the veggie sandwich.  We all shared a garden salad with turkey.  We are not beer drinkers so cannot comment on the award winning ales.  Small pond with ducks off the outside seating."}
{"text":"What a find love this place. Angie is a super star made us feel so welcome food was amazing loved it we will be back and also be recommending to all our friends"}
{"text":"To the manager on 7/30 at 3pm: boo. The kids menu says pick 4 items for $6.50. It doesn't say one from each category. So you charged us double! And even after you recognized the menu error you still wouldn't make it right?! Bad form. Your place is normally great for kids with the little stage area & games. Now we're just disappointed."}
{"text":"Beer is amazing. They change the taps every few weeks. Atmosphere is great. Great service all around. They have ping pong and karaoke night. Food is okay though lol more for the beer and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went back to  try their grilled cheese sandwich ..but it took an hour to make and was delivered cold..I am not going to blame the cooks..just as i came in there were 150 teachers in a  mob wearing their red shirts from the teachers strike who came in to have a meeting and ordered a ton of food  flooding the kitchen with orders. I will try again next week ... By the way can anyone tell me how these \"poor\" teachers can  cry \"poor mouth\" yet they had enough money to order $50,000 worth of red protest shirts?  George Soros money?"}
{"text":"I've only been to spokes a few times after softball games, with groups and just two of us at a time.  I love their patio, the music has been really loud each time I've been so it's nice to be outside to just hang.  The servers are always very friendly and the atmosphere is very laid back.  (Perfect for after a sporting event and a rowdy group.)  Their wings are good....the queso on the other hand....pass.  It was crusty within like 10min, yuck.  The beer selection is good, limited to local breweries so don't expect Blue Moon or Coors...they have the good stuff!  The servers are very knowledgable and happy to hang and explain the different types and bring samples.  All in all, it's a great spot to hang and try a few new beers.  I'll be back when I'm on this side of town. :)"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood find. Good beer list and the food is good as well. Will definitely come back as the price for happy hour was great!"}
{"text":"Food here is fantastic. Service is great. Location is convenient. It's likely to become my new neighborhood bar. I don't know why I waited so long to come eat here, but I'm glad I finally did.   I like the setup of the bar. It's all inviting and open inside. It'll take awhile before I feel like a regular, but I feel comfortable here right away. The menu has something on it for everyone. If you're so hungry that nothing sounds good, Spokes will have something that'll jump out at you. They also seem to pride themselves on their beer options as well.   Coming from Old Town area where British Open, Papago Brewery, and Frasher's (RIP) were my favorite little local places. Since I moved to Tempe, I haven't really found anything that could live up to that... until now.   I'm looking forward to coming here a lot."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!! Great rotating craft beers on site, a simple beer menu which gives realistic details of what the beer will taste like. The price, like 4 or 4.50 a beer, and for craft beer, that makes me very happy! Good company, great beer, great service. I haven't ever ordered food here, but the presentation from what I've seen others get is very spot on. This is going to be my go to place for sure!"}
