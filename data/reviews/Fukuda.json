{"text":"- The sushi was incredibly fresh & top notch as agreed upon by everyone in our party- the best sushi we've ever had. 
- The atmosphere/decor leaves a lot to be desired- with how good the food is (& what their prices are), they could try a little harder (and put some cushions down on their hard benches- our tushes were not happy at the end of our meal!)
- We could tell our server was new & everyone has to learn so we gladly cut him some slack on not quite knowing what everything on the menu was.
- Our biggest qualm was that it took FOREVER for our food to come out and it was a Thursday early evening with not that many people in the restaurant so that was a little strange. 

Overall, a good place to go if you want really good sushi but I think there's still lot of room for improvement as an establishment as a whole."}
{"text":"This place is OK , I will revisit and hopefully increase the rating. 

The decor is a mix between traditional Japanese and modern art. 
The service was good, very attentive staff. It was not busy while we were there, but it was just starting to pick up. 

They offer Teppanyaki and regular seating which is nice. However the regular seating tables are a little close together. 

We ordered sushi rolls, the fish was fresh and the flavors were balanced well. Were it not for the fact that the rice was under cooked it would have been the best sushi I've had in this state lately. 

I will try them again another day, hopefully it will be a redeeming experience.     :-)"}
{"text":"For many years, one of our favorite teppan and sushi restaurant spots in Vegas. The food was fresh, delicious and yummy. 

There is however one negative aspect; gift cards for fukuda.

I bought my Brother and his wife a gift card to fukuda for $75.00 for the holiday season. They ate there not long after and spent around 35 dollars(neither of them drinkers, which increases your bill dramatically).

They were then informed that fukuda does not give the remaining balance as cash, nor do they issue another card with the balance. They contested, but fukuda was not budging on this \"policy.\" I guess they needed the money, to pay for their \"recession lunch special\" sign. 

Well, I still love the food served there,  that experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Pun intended."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 5 times, the first two times it was incredible. Then the last three visits just went downhill, The very last time I was there it was lunch time during the week, the waitress had maybe my table and one other, she was just standing around day dreaming, she was hanging her arms on the counter just staring out at nothing.  I was disgusted that I had to walk over to her every time for a refill on our drinks and to check on our order. We ordered fried rice and it had to have been the absolute worst fried rice ever! I swear they put an entire onion in my order, and it tasted raw. I was really upset because I had thought it was a descent place to go to. Every since I have not been back because all I think about when I drive by it is that onion."}
{"text":"Hipster Sushi... No Thanks.

From the awkward/unfriendly greeting to the small portion size to the undercooked chicken skewer to being handed the bill by the hostess who then proceeded to just hover there at the table, iPad & Square in hand, while we divvied up the bill. We could not get out of that place fast enough. And we all left hungry. (read more reviews I see we weren't alone).

One star for the bowl of ramen, and one star for the grilled scallions. 

Don't order the oysters. For $10 hubs got the two smallest mollusks he's ever seen, drowned in the toppings.  And when that was all he ordered, the waitress didn't even warn him it was so small.  He got something small because he wasn't very hungry but that was ridiculous. Sushi rolls were ok, nothing special. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"I had a lot of fun with the owner and sushi chef when they were operating the little counter out front. Super nice, healthy sense of humor, made me special sushi. When they opened the restaurant, I was excited. But then I saw they used foie gras in a butter with one of their dishes. I asked the chef about sourcing, and he said he wasn't sure about the conditions the ducks lived in. I have a personal policy to not eat anywhere that serves foie gras or veal, since the animals are raised so abusively except when restaurants source conscientiously. So, we talked a little about that, I thanked them, and ate somewhere else. I would love to see Fukuda voice a policy to not serve foie gras or veal, or to voice a policy to choose humane sources! Would love to be able to eat here again."}
{"text":"I give 2 stars because the main problem is that the portions are SO SMALL for the  high prices. Especially the ramen. Other places in Pittsburgh charge the same price and you get a normal sized share of ramen.   It's a shame, because I do really like this place and would recommend because the food is good, but they need to reconsider some things."}
{"text":"I can only give this place a 3 stars and would give 2 and 1/2 if the system would let me and here's why.  I have been there 4 times and eaten 3 times.  The food is awesome!   They have fantastic sushi and hibachi.  The hibachi grill itself if very entertaining as the chefs are very skilled and add humor and a show to preparing your food.
   
    So what's the problem, the overall service is spotty. The last time I ate there was about an hour before they closed. When 10 o'clock hit, and clearly my wife, friends, and I were still eating,  the waitress came up to us and asked if we needed a to-go box.  Then when we told her that we were still eating, she and others in the restaurants hovered over us and eagle eyed us until we felt uncomfortable enough to get the hell out. 

    My last attempt to eat there was about a month ago.   When we entered the restaurant, there were several people waiting up front waiting for a table.  We waited for 15 minutes and staff would walk up to the front, but never acknowleged us being there to put us on the list. While waiting another couple before us got pissed off and left, due to the same experience.  During the same time another family came through the door behind us and some one from the restaurant finally came to the front and put them on the list before us, even though we had been there at least 10 minutes before them.   We finally left too.  

It's a shame!  This restaurant's food is great, but they need to work on their customer service.  If they did that I would give them 5 stars, but they rely too heavily on their food to draw business.  However, intermediate/intermittant service in my opinion will chase customers away regardless how good the food is.  I will attempt to go back one more time some point in the future.  That will be the tie breaker to my visits and determine if I continue to go to this nearby restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. 
Friendly and fast service and sick food: we had oysters, saba, edamame (recommended by our server for being unique; it was), a couple robatayaki skewers and a platter of super-fresh nigiri. My wife said he wanted to move in upstairs and eat there every day.
The prices will creep up on you so beware (though they were worth it to us for such meticulously prepared and sourced stuff).
It has a somewhat casual vibe in both the service and decor (Cure is like that too), which I like, but may not appeal to everyone."}
{"text":"Good food but supper over priced.
Their sushi is good but the ramen are way to salty and the noodle is bad choice of the chef. too soft and overcooked.
It is good for a small group to have a after dinner drink but not for a real meal, I don;t eat a lot, but I was hungry after spending almost $70 there with my husband, so next time I will eat first and just have drinks with their wonderful snacks."}
{"text":"Fantastic high quality fish and preparation. They're moving locations as of October 2014. Stay tuned for the new location."}
{"text":"Review is just for the AYCE menu.  Good selection, they even have sashimi.  But tuna is frozen tuna.  Salmon was excellent.  Went there twice in one week and both times,(someone else's choice). they were out of uni. Service is great and the hibachi meals look great!"}
{"text":"Tremendous food service all good despite others opinions. Had dinner  for 4 brought in 3 bottles of wine had an infinite variety of spectacular dishes for 188 bucks. Service was excellent  I'd highly recommend"}
{"text":"Condensed review: Everything I've had was well-prepared, flavorful and delicious.  I've had the ramen, barbecued stick chicken, grilled edamame and sushi rolls.  The staff is very nice.

And now for the reason for just an A-ok rating.  The main problem is the price point of the items.  I'll pay for great food, but it's not like this place is in Manhattan.  The decor is eclectic, cool, but still don't seem refined even for shabby chic.  The other main problem is that the service can be sloooooow.  I live within walking distance and they quoted me at 10 minutes.  We didn't get our food until a minimum of 20 minutes after we arrived (about 12 minutes later.)  My gf thought we were forgotten, but that could not have been possible since there were only 6 diners in the place.  

I love seeing new restaurants with great food coming into my neighborhood,  But unless the price point decreases by around 20-25%, I can't see it lasting more than a year.  I will likely go check out other places instead of ordering here.  But if they did change it, I could see it flourishing with line outside."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with this place.  First, it's small and there was only one server - at one point every table was full and there were people at the bar - still, we never felt neglected at all.  

The food is wonderful.  Sure, this isn't the cheapest sushi in town but it is top notch.  Best spicy tuna roll I've ever had - and I try those everywhere.  There was a wonderful salmon roe with quail egg that was just luscious.  Grilled edamame?  Yes please.  Best I've ever had, and edamame is another snack I always order and use as a compass.  I was part of a party of 5; we ordered a bunch of sushi and several other dishes (ramen, ponzu duck and pork belly to name a few. )I'm bummed we didn't try the fish head. 

I didn't leave stuffed to the gills, and frankly I think that's something we should all get more used to.  I was satisfied and nothing was wasted.  The 5 of us spent about $140, which for the quality of the dishes I thought was completely reasonable.  

I emailed to get reservations, and the next day Fukuda sent me an email asking about our experience.  I can't tell you how much I appreciated that follow up.  I highly recommend giving this place a shot, just be sure to not be in a rush and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic and intricate dishes.. Best Japanese venue in the burgh. Fish is fresh and rich. Will definitely be coming back, I was blown away!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place. I'm afraid it will probably offend some Pittsburgh residents as the portions are rather small relative to the prices. However, really really good sushi is expensive. This is some of the best sashimi I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I ordered a spider roll, a lobster roll and Uni. The rolls tastes delicious, especially a spider roll. A fried soft crab in the roll was fresh and crispy. But for Uni, it tasted fishy, not fresh when I had it. Maybe you have to ask a waiter about its quality before order it."}
{"text":"Fukuda is a small and inviting little Japanese restaurant in Bloomfield that brings exceptionally good sushi and Japanese street food snacks to Pittsburgh. As a lover of sushi and frequent visitor to Japan this is a much needed--and appreciated--addition to Pittsburgh. 

We tried Fukuda on I think their fourth night of restaurant operations (they had previously operated as a popup restaurant and food truck). The place got pretty busy while we were there, so I guess word is spreading fast. Service was friendly and warm. The food was great. We had a chef's selection of sushi (nigiri and sashimi), some takoyaki (fried octopus balls), pork belly, and some specialty maki rolls. Everything was delicious and at the standard expected in sushi restaurants in cities like New York...and Tokyo!

What impressed us was their commitment to using high quality ingredients, including some fish flown in fresh from the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo. I don't think any other \"Japanese\" restaurant in Pittsburgh keeps such high standards. 

We will be back again...and again...and again...!"}
{"text":"Love this mobile late night sushi concept. Tried it for the first time at a Tapped event and their herb concoction atop their tuna based signature roll had me hooked, if their mobile unit is at an event you better believe that's what I'm getting and usually there's fair amount of food truck competition.  

UPDATE:

Their new brick and mortar location on Liberty is just perfect.  Beautifully restored original molding and lighting and art by a local artist created a lovely cozy dining environment to come into out of the short but sweet snow last Thursday. Walking in we were offered some sake to warm us up and our tea came right now.  We sat at the bar and ordered big chef's choice sampler of the sashimi and nigiri,the Big Eye Tuna melted in my mouth but the yellowtail and salmon were just as great, flown in fresh daily from Japan.  And to my delight they had quail eggs done right with roe, one of my favorite taste experiences.  Really loved this place, for sure my new go-to sushi spot.  Will have to try the fish heads and ramen next time!"}
{"text":"Never thought Bloomfield would have a destination-worthy sushi joint but here we are.  This sounds (and is!!) truly terrible but I get nervous anytime I see a non-Japanese chef at a sushi counter. My fears were unfounded. Start to finish we seriously didn't have one bite that was anything less than stellar. I loved their nigiri, thought the rice was phenomenal and enjoyed their willingness to have fun and explore untraditional tastes.

I will note that the pacing was terrible and it wasn't even crowded. Can't imagine what it must be like on a busy night. Maybe it should just be a counter for 8 people or something. But I'm willing to forgive when what they do put down in front of you is just that good."}
{"text":"Anytime I can get all you can eat sushi, I'm a happy camper! The service here was excellent and for $27 AYCE sushi the pricing isn't bad either. However, this place is getting a 4 because the sushi could have been better. Although the ambiance at Blue Fin isn't as nice as Fukuda, the freshness of the fish and the flavors of the specialty rolls were much better."}
{"text":"This place is Class ! Who cares what people think ! If you love good food? What are you waiting for!"}
{"text":"Great chefs and good food. The Mexican roll for an appetizer. Then we move on to the feast. Which is the tempenyaki or however it is spelt. Lots of food and the chef bruce lee yes that's right. Was amazing best fried rice ever and the angus strip wow very tender. Like all the other reviews state after 8 you will be saving a lot of money around $10 off. The shrimp and scallops were insanely tender and seemed to melt in your mouth cooked to perfection. Check this place out. It will be named \"The Samurai\" in a month or two but the same quality and persons should be expected."}
{"text":"This place is definitively open! They have 50% off their basic sushi rolls, nigiri and a few others. The sushi has good days and bad days depending on the sushi chefs. The teppanyaki is pretty good, the chefs are cool."}
{"text":"Horrible service and atmosphere. The quality of food has also gone down since the change of ownership. The only good thing was the chef, Gio. Unfortunately it was his last night so we will not be returning. Also, even though its a Japanese restaurant with old samurai decor, its now owned by Koreans so theres loud Korean pop music playing that confuses me."}
{"text":"I so want to like this place, because I feel like we should be supporting new, inventive restaurants in the Burgh. But the fact remains... every time I come here, I leave hungry. And when you've just spent like $30 pp (without any beverages), that just seems wrong.

Food remains quite tasty. If you have the time, I highly HIGHLY recommend the fish head. It is phenomenal. Be prepared to get down and dirty with that fish head. The meat around the collarbone of a fish are some of the fattiest, tastiest stuff on the fish. Imagine tons of toro, but on the head. Definitely needs to be shared though. 3 people is ideal.

They've wised up and have cut back on the amount of fish they put in the rolls. The rolls are now pretty standard sized, with not that much fish in them. The rice is well done, but it's no longer remotely close to a good deal.

Also started charging corkage fees (no big deal, just wanted to clarify what I had down before).

So... sorry Fukuda. I like you, I like your personnel (although service can be pretty darn slow), and I like the concept. But that can only get you so far."}
{"text":"I went here for restaurant week. They had a 4 course special that included salad, sushi, fish, and dessert. Overall, the meal was amazing. Everything tasted great and was super fresh, but there wasn't a whole lot there for $35 and that was the special pricing for restaurant week. 

We also got a salmon avocado roll that what disappointing and took 52 MINUTES! EEEEK. We actually got our dessert 25 minutes before we got the sushi roll. For having 3 other tables and 4 people at the sushi bar, this was a little annoying! The roll itself was fresh but super tiny and overpriced. 

The bathroom was nice when we first got there (remember we were there for almost 2 hours UGH), but when I went in right before I left it was DISGUSTING!!! ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew! 

I might get takeout from here again, but I don't think I will be dining in."}
{"text":"Really delicious sashimi. Beautiful presentation. I imagine the price is directly correlated to the fact that they get fish in regularly rather than once a week. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh.  I'm surprised people have commented that it's overpriced, I thought it was reasonable for the quality.  A small BYOB, it's a great find."}
{"text":"Pop up pop in. These dudes have true passion for what they do and it shows. It was a simple pop-up menu of maki, sashimi and authentic Japanese street food and it was outstanding. Thank you for a great evening. Looking forward to the opening."}
{"text":"The sushi was yummy but expensive. But I would expect it would be for the quality of fish they serve. I really liked their ramen dish. I'm not sure if they had a variety of ramen dishes or just one? Anywho, I would go back for the ramen. Oishii! =)

BYOB and a good late night grub for sure."}
{"text":"After browsing on yelp for a new place to try in Pittsburgh, this place popped up and we had to try it because we are big fans of Asian cuisine, especially if it has a bit of flair to it.

We walked in and the shop definitely has a very cozy feel, the sushi bar is fairly small and the place seats about 20-30 people max. The place is BYOB and when we saw the menu we got our hopes up. They serve Japanese small bites of the hot and cold (sushi) variety. We ordered a large chef's sushi sampler, takoyaki, oysters and after the bites came out and we saw the small portions, we also ordered a ramen.

The service was very good; we brought in a bottle of white wine and the waitress made sure it was chilled and checked on it several times. We started with the takoyaki and oysters which were very tasty. The sushi was also cut sliced very well and tasted very fresh, better than Chaya and Little Tokyo Bistro. Our biggest complaint and the reason why this place gets 3 stars is the ramen. I had high expectations for it, but what makes or breaks ramen is the broth and then the noodles. Great ramen has a very fragrant and savory broth that is not too salty; on this occasion this broth was WAY too salty. Either they added too much soy sauce or too much salt. The noodles also weren't great, they felt a bit bland.

Overall, We might be interested in trying Fukuda again, but what's holding me back is that the price point they charge doesn't seem to be worth what they provide. If I pay $90 for a meal, I want to be satisfied. That can either mean I'm full or experienced culinary enlightenment, but after Fukuda, I found myself wanting more of both."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is getting stellar reviews. We were first in for the night, and the place smelled like someone was just smoking inside.

Food: The fish quality is good, but its not better than Chaya in Squirrel Hill. The thing you can get here is really obscure fish, but if you're no connoisseur, there's no point to it. I do like that they had real wasabi, though.

Portions: So TINY. No warning. The $15 chef's special is three thin slices. We went to taco bell afterward.

Service: Slow. Unsophisticated - makes us pass down the tea cups? At $30/pp? Stacking plates as you leave? Also, their wireless router doesn't work up front, so paying is a pain.

Aesthetic: Yeah, its a cute place. Why do the water pitchers have rocks in them? It only works when the whole mood matches.

Go if you're into obscure fish and have a lot of time, personally, its not for me."}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I'm glad this place exists in bloomfield as the only other passable alternative to Umi, and that I will update this review after I've experienced it again.

Place is comfortable and small for a sushi place.  I came here with a friend who isn't very experienced so we decided to order rolls rather than straight fish, however I did get an order of Otoro, which was silghtly steep at $18 for two slices.  Rolls were great, the spicy tuna was actually spicy which is a refreshing change.  The Otoro wasn't as buttery as I expected and the temperature of the fish was distracting- it was way too cold in the center and cool near the edges.  When temperature is so important for just two pieces of fish like this, I would have expected it to be perfect.

Service was great up until the end of the meal.  She was thorough in explaining the menu.  We had ordered something that she suggested (one of the more expensive box rolls at the bottom of the menu) but it came out as a square of rice with a thin sliver of yellowtail on top.  Neither my buddy nor I are particularly fond of yellowtail, especially on a huge hunking wad of rice, so we let her know.  She proceeded to suggest that we \"take the fish off and just eat everything else\" which I was floored by.  Did... she just tell me to eat rice balls?  We didn't eat any of it, and got no compensation back.

All things considered, this place is passable, but I will be back for the omakase which is offered in 3 tiers.  $65 for 4-6 courses, $85 for 5-8 courses, and $100+ for \"sit down and the chef throws fish at you until you say stop\""}
{"text":"bottom line review :   good but way over-priced .   this is hipster-kitsch sushi dining ."}
{"text":"Fukuda first came into my life during Bloomfield's Little Italy days. It was there that I first witnessed a stand selling Korean Tacos. They were delicious, and the owner was amicable, explaining that he would soon have the adjacent restaurant space. Fast forward to December, and I figured I would try Fukuda with my girlfriend.

The decor is minimalist and ambient, the marriage of space and food harmony. This perfectly captured the essence of good sushi, which is a simple presentation, crafted with the utmost care.

To start we ordered Salmon Sushi, and Kampachi. Both were delectable slices of the freshest fish. The rice was moist and had the perfect amount of wasabi between the fish and rice. I could literally eat sushi all day from Fukuda.

We then had the Ramen dish, also a most excellent( Bill and Ted give a thumbs up) concoction, with a delicious rich broth. It seemed to take a while for the Ramen to come out, but the awkward wait was mitigated by free Sake, which was delicious. 

As mentioned in other reviews, the portions are a bit on the small side, so I was still hungry. I ordered the spicy tuna roll, and it was superb. Many times when you order rolls you are looking down at the rice, searching for wherever the fish may be hiding. That was not the case here at Fukuda. Every ingredient and portion received the tender care of the chef all the way from selection to the table. It is great to see that sort of attention to detail in a restaraunt around Bloomfield, as I have noted some others in the area seem to miss the little things.

So why 4 stars instead of 5? The service was a little shaky, and there seemed to be little in the way of organization regarding that. I was approached by at least 3 different people asking the same questions. Either way, I will be back so no worries, you made a repeat out of me!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dining experience here. At first staff could not fit our party so they offered to set us all up outside and when a space opened up inside they were so kind to offer to move us all back inside! Lovely service by the host. Food was seasoned spectacularly and I enjoyed the cold tofu, edamame ( get the smoked sea salt) as well as the veggie skewers and a small order of avocado sushi (am a vegetarian). Beware- portions are small- you probably have to order 3-4 things or even 5-6 things if you are a guy. But the quality and taste are worth it."}
{"text":"I went to Fukuda, funnily enough, with Mr. Damon!  It was good enough, only the service was pretty slow and not very attentive to what we actually asked for.

I have to be in the 'mood' to get sushi, so I ended up getting a teriyaki/tempura combination.  The teriyaki chicken was charred a bit too much, but the tempura and everything accompanying it was delicious.  The Teppanyaki grill looked fun, onion volcanos and all.  Our friend Rainbow roll looked fresh and was huge, so that bodes well.

I'd give this place another try and see if the service amps up and probably check out their sushi options."}
{"text":"Tried Fukuda last night for dinner after a trip to the Galleria Mall before we hit the movie theater and we were both extremely impressed with our sushi.  We sat at the sushi bar, so we didn't have any issues with service.  Seems like were were arrived just before the Saturday night rush as well.

We split three rolls: Rainbow, Hold 'Em & Surf N Turf.  The salmon, tuna & shrimp on the Rainbow & Hold 'Em rolls melted in our mouths! So delicious.  The Surf N Turf was certainly unexpected - filet topped a roll stuffed with crabmeat with a little bit of a spicy kick - AH-MAZE-ING.

Total bill, including two large Sapporos: $46.  We would've stayed and taken part in their AYCE deal ($26 for an hour of ordering, includes all their specialty rolls) if we would've known the movie we were going to was going to suck as much as it did.

Hands down, my favorite sushi - so far - in Las Vegas.  Other than The Social House at TI, which is no longer in that location, I have yet to be so impressed with sushi.  I'm dreaming of our next visit already."}
{"text":"Good service, friendly staff and fresh fish. just the right amount of rice on their rolls. 
A Business name change coming  this fall."}
{"text":"To start you should know I had seriously high expectations for this place. You should know this because I think your expectations definitely can alter your experience of a place. Having only been in Pittsburgh for about 5 months, I've had some okay, sushi, but nothing to write home about. But in following the social media around Fukuda, and having recently watched Jiro dreams of sushi (it's on netflix instant- watch it) I was really quite excited to try this place out. I knew it wasn't going to be cheap. I also did not care if it was cheap. I wanted good sushi. (Jiro charges $300 a plate to start for his excellent sushi) I got out of Fukuda for only 48 bucks (total for 2) and it was a bargain. You should also know that my expectations were met and exceeded. 

To start we had 2 skewers because they were out of the pork belly. (next time!) We didn't even really want the skewers we just ordered them to augment the meal. So imagine our surprise when they were totally awesome! The shiitake mushroom was delightful, savory, meaty even, and the chicken was even better. 

Then came our sushi rolls we ordered the salmon avocado, spicy tuna, and tuna avocado. Each roll was perfectly crafted-6 pieces with a impressive amount of fresh fish in each. The avocados were dead ripe. (I abhor an unripe avocado) The spicy tuna was so good that it transcended my recognition of spicy tuna  roll at any other sushi place. it was just.... better? tastier? awesome-er?

Lastly came our takoyaki. Now I should sidebar and explain that I just moved here from Philly and around the corner from where I lived in Philly for a few years was a place that just made takoyaki and Japanese pizza. My friend who was visiting and I used to go to have these japanese balls all the time so we had some pretty high standards. Their version does not disappoint. You only get 3 which is only sad because it makes sharing hard, but otherwise they were perfect. Savory, and delightful. We almost ordered a second batch they were so great. 

At the end of the meal we were both full, delighted, and excited to return. It is safe to say that I will be back. Hopefully often. Just reliving this to write the review has made me want to go back (and I was only there last night...) Go try it I think you'll feel similarly.

pro tip: they're BYO so you should get in on that."}
{"text":"BF and I saw the sign for pop-up sushi on our way to Ginza in Bloomfield and decided to pop in in Fukuda instead. Loved it. The owners were incredibly nice and provided great personalized service.Okinomiyaki was delicious as was their signature role. We brought our own saki and soju which was no problem. They dont have real dishes yet, but that really didn't bother me. It was a nice change of pace and incredibly reasonable! I'll definitely check them out at Shadow Lounge on Sundays as well!"}
{"text":"Fukuda is the reason people say, \"I don't like sushi\". It is the reason people don't want to try new things. It's why dogs don't like cats. OK... I take the last one back. But it was pretty bad.
We went during lunch there were maybe 5 tables occupied, we waited for 5 minutes before our drink orders were taken.  Then we waited another 5 minutes for 2 other people to come and re take our drink orders.  Fukuda claims to be a Japanese bistro so I went with the tonkatsu box ( a pretty standard Japanese dish) Just a breaded deep fried pork cutlet and a type of Japanese Worcestershire sauce appropriately called tonkatsu sauce.  20 minutes later I was served cold tonkatsu  with  a cap full of tonkatsu sauce, (that tasted more like Vons brand bbq sauce ), a brownish salad that had seen  better days, 3 California rolls  made with a  substance that was supposed to resemble fake crab,  and 3 pieces of tempura (onion , yam, shrimp).  The yam was delicious.  The two people with me also ordered boxes one salmon box and one tonkatsu box. Friend with the salmon box actually enjoyed his salmon. We also ordered a spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll and a tiger rolls, at the lunch special price of $7.95 a piece. They were mediocre at best. After 5 minutes of trying to flag our server we were treated with beverage refills ( for the first time) and our  $56 dollar check.   

 half a star for atmosphere and   half a star being consistently terrible in all areas."}
{"text":"This place is FRESH! The freshest fish around! I was here for a special Yelp event and got to watch the chef fillet a fish that was delivered less than two hours prior. What a treat! I also got to sample tuna sushi and spicy tuna maki. Both were delicious. We were also served an arugula salad and edamame. Both on point! The edamame was lightly seasoned and the salad dressing was fresh and also very light. 

I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for something a sushi place that is a little different. Although they prepare a lot of your typical rolls,this place is all about traditional sushi. This isn't the place to go if you want specialty rolls drenched in tempura and sauces. This place wants you to taste the fish! and you should, because it's so so good!

Prices are pretty typical. I'm used to paying around $6 for a spicy tuna and here they charged $7.5, but at the other places, I don't know how fresh or good the tuna really is. At Fukuda, I know I'm getting top of the line fish, so the extra $1.5 is well spent. 

The menu changes frequently and is based on what fish is available."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Food was acceptable, but nothing memorable service was Ok."}
{"text":"When we were done having lunch here my friend and I looked at each other and said at the same time, \"Wow, that was really good!\"

Fukuda is a restaurant new to Bloomfield, and because of its unassuming storefront it is easy to miss--but to never try this place would be a crime because the food is very good.

This restaurant is small inside but though it was busy, we were seated without a wait.

I had the salmon robatayaki and edamame, both dishes were excellent.  My friend opted for the tasting menu and I was sorry I'd not followed suit because everything looked delicious.  

Our bill came to about $40 and we both left satisfied.  It's dangerous having a restaurant this tasty within walking distance from my house!  Give this place a try, I hear it is also excellent for lunch."}
{"text":"It has great service and a very nice atmosphere and they waited on us very quickly and came by often to meet our needs! The chef came by to make us our food, everything was great ! I ordered the salmon with the salad, soup noddles, & veggies on the side.. But the salmon was  not quite pleasant!!!  It had a very fishy taste!! It was not what I expected from a But overall The Teppanyaki grill looked fun, with the onion volcano's and the veggie chopping!! I would go again next time I'm in town to try something else on their menu.. Anyhow I had a good time, I would recommend it to anyone!!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal!  the fish was fresh fresh fresh!  The sushi chef knows what he is doing!  They have very authentic dishes!  Yes, it is a bit expensive, but the fish is delicious!  Looking forward to a return trip!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best sushi in Pittsburgh, and actually the best sushi I have had period.  TJ, the chef, is amazing and super passionate about the food.  Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar and get the Omakase, where the chef just prepares for you based on whats fresh, you will leave totally stuffed and so satisfied.  Not only is the food amazing, but the people that work there are great and tons of fun. Have a sense of humor and bring yourself plenty of wine and sake to go with your meal.  Don't miss the late night service on Fridays and Saturdays.  I usually eat here at least once a week, sometimes, if Im lucky, two!  Truly a hidden gem in Pittsburgh."}

{"text":"Usually I can give or take sushi, but every now and then I get a hankering for it... say, after drooling for hours over Jiro Dreams of Sushi or after gorging myself with heavy holiday meals for days on end- the latter in this particular case.  Thus brought my boyfriend and I to Fukuda for a date night after the twelve days of Christmas feasting.  Although the restaurant is small we were seated immediately without a reservation on a Friday night.

The only things keeping me from rating Fukuda as a stand-out five-star restaurant are some slight disorganization mishaps that occurred throughout our meal and the extremely annoyingly placed light at our table (blaring red light right in my eye line across the table).  After ordering we were brought our sushi orders relatively quickly and gobbled them up immediately.  This is some of the best-quality fish and delicious sushi I have had and definitely one of, if not the best, I have found in Pittsburgh.  We kept it simple and started with the salmon and kampachi sushi ($7 each) along with a cold tuna appetizer ($10).  The appetizer was okay- excellent quality fish and tasty but missing a punch from a citrus or something similar- but both sushi choices were melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I had never had kampachi before but it is now one of my favorite sushi options, similar to a fatty salmon or yellowtail and served with a garnish of green onion on top.  After the sushi we sat waiting for our next option- the ramen- to arrive.  Three times three different staff members came over to ask if we needed anything else and each time we reminded them that we had ordered more food that should be on its way.  We sat, and then sat some more, both with growing hunger as the sushi didn't keep us full very long.  I am not joking when I share that we sat so long we started dipping our chopsticks in soy sauce to try to get some sustenance. Eventually yet another staff member came over and apologized that it was taking so long and offered us complimentary sake- we happily accepted.  While sipping on the sake our ramen FINALLY arrived and it was piping hot with a fragrant broth, noodles, pork, egg, and bamboo shoots.  I am not sure if it was due to hunger or not, but it definitely hit the spot and did not last very long as we slurped it up.  We decided to order one additional item to make sure we would stay full and went with the inside-out spicy tuna maki.  This came lightning fast compared to the ramen and we were even offered more sake to go with it.  Once again, the quality of the fish was exceptional and the roll itself was well-made and the perfect size.

I will be back to Fukuda but just hope they get themselves a bit more organized before my next visit."}
{"text":"New name... Samurai Steakhouse and Sushi. Wonderful!  Best \"all you can eat\" I've had in town - 26.99.  Fresh, flavorful, 
and beautiful presentation. Lover Wrap, love roll, orange crush, Samurai surf and turf. Just great quality and taste!!"}
{"text":"Currently operating as a \"pop-up\" sushi bar, but soon to open permanently in this location. They also have a mobile unit for street fare. Fun!  Running a small fresh sushi menu for now (with PBR for your drinking pleasure), however they intend to expand the menu to include hot Japanese specialties. Exciting! Super cool guys adding to the awesome of PGH. 

For now, it looks like you can catch them at this listed location on Tues. and Wed. from 1-7pm and on Fri. and Sat. from 5-11pm. Then also at Bar Marco on Fridays from 11-3pm and Sunday nights at Shadow Lounge."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Fukuda now for 3 years. Every time we stop in for dinner it is amazing! The chefs who prepare the sushi are so friendly and always make us feel like we are their #1 customer. The owner always comes over to us and greets us. The sushi is beyond delicious, and always fresh. Fukuda has great specials daily and now they offer all you can eat sushi! They don't fluff the rolls with extra rice and cucumbers like other all you can eat sushi restaurants tend to do. We have never tried the any other menu options that they offer because we love the sushi! I wouldn't go any where else in town for sushi! We love Fukuda!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that the fish quality, especially the ebi, has gone down a bit since the last time, but to be honest, I have noticed this in many other sushi restaurants. IT seems the ebi is flat and not full, so maybe it is just what the wholesaler are delivering. The Tuna and the salmon was melt in your mouth, like butter."}
{"text":"Very fresh fish, creative preparations, friendly and competent wait staff, BYOB."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, the food here, specifically the sushi is phenomenal.  However, our experience with the service left a whole lot to be desired.  

A few friends and I went here during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week and some of us decided to go with the tasting menu.  I mean why not, you get to sample a little bit of everything.  

As many others have mentioned, this place is small.  So small that I felt bad for the wait staff that had to maneuver through cramped spaces to get to their customers.  But all the wait staff we encountered were friendly although not necessarily attentive.

This is definitely not one of those places to go to when you need to eat and run.  It's more like you need to be at a dead stop with no where to go to even to begin to enjoy this place...and even that may not be enough to enjoy it, as was my experience.      

I went with the tasting menu which was a selection of sashimi, followed by oysters and then your choice of one out of three entrees.  I opted for the tofu...which I'll later regret.  

The sushi was incredible and came out in a timely manner.  I haven't tasted sushi this good since a trip to Nobu in NYC.  Then it gets akward...there are 2 tables which came in after us, probably a good 20 minutes (or more) after we sat down.  And yet they were served their food and finished...yes finished their entire meals before we got a glimpse of our oysters.  What's that you ask...maybe they didn't order the tasting menu?  YES they did!  Our table was right next to them so we had to watch as they were given all the dishes off the tasting menu with no delay.

So after eating our sushi and adding 40 minutes, we finally got our oysters.  We of course had to catch the attention of one of the wait staff to see what was going on.  No explanation but within about 2 minutes we were served our oysters.  After that the entree came out in a timely manner.  

While I had heard their ramen was great, I opted for the tofu b/c most in the group were getting the ramen.  Big mistake - do not get the tofu!  While the seasoning sitting on top of the tofu was decent, the tofu itself was not good.  I enjoy tofu but I like the firm tofu and it has to be cooked the right way.  But this was the super soft tofu that had an unpleasant texture and nonexistent taste.  I did not finish it.  

That being said, I added an extra star b/c I ordered the wrong thing.  I really feel like this was a 2 star experience.  There are two parts to the dining experience, food and the service.  While the food (with the exception of the tofu) could have carried this place to a 4-5 star rating, the service was so lackluster that it really ruined the experience for me.  

It felt like those that were dressed like hipsters got better service than our group...or I should say got service.  Now maybe I'm being paranoid, but that's just too weird for me NOT to notice.  Next time, I'll dress like a hipster and test my theory.     

It's byob so don't forget your alcohol!"}
{"text":"Blah. 

It saddens me that the sushi here is definitely not worth the price. My main question after eating the whopping $15 From Japan!!!! OMG!!! fish is.. Who is inspecting this fish before purchasing? Because it doesn't taste that great. It just doesn't. 

I also realized that their other sushi prices are still not worth it..you'll spend at least $3 more per order of all other fish here, and it's more irritating that that includes No-taste Tuna and Seen it before salmon. Save your $ and go somewhere else (Sushi Tomo perhaps..)

Strangely, their shiitake and chocolate ice cream was phenomenal...like..REALLY excellent."}
{"text":"The sushi sucks here.  It's expensive and small portions for fishy tasty rolls.

TOtally not worth it.  Don't go there for sushi!  They couldn't even cut the pieces of hamachi consistently.  

The only thing this place is good for is their hibachi recession special.

It's pretty good deal and you get a show.  The guys who do the grill

really put on a show and it was fun.  The food is hibachi same flavor and

sauce whether you go to benihana or here.

I got the steak and shrimp.  The steak was melt in my mouth good and the shrimp was good.

The scallops were bleh.

Mahi Mahi was ok but, I'm a steak eater.  

Go after 8PM for their recession special hibachi.  It's the only thing that worth going for"}
{"text":"What can I say?  The food is SMALL, the prices are BIG.  After a hard day at work, I didn't want to blow all my hard earned money on just trying to fill my stomach with their incredibly small portions.  

$24 dollar sashimi --6 pieces of sashimi, 4 nigiri 
$8 ramen--a teeny tiny bowl you can hold in one hand, good noodles but way too SALTY, 2 thin slices of pork
$5-6 skewers--delicious slices of fish on a stick but you maybe will only get 4 bites out of these
$10--FIVE (that's $2 each) slices of pork belly with a kick of wasabi

With every course that came, my boyfriend and I would look down at each tiny plate as if saying to ourselves---that's it???  What was supposed to be an entree, looked more like an appetizer.  For us, we won't be going back anytime soon.  It might be a different story if it was exceptional but honestly, it's sushi made by hipsters and just WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for what you get.    

Also, avoid the table with a light jutting out from the wall into your face."}
{"text":"The service is exceptional. There was a South American teppan chef that was very nice and generous. I had the calamari and it was sooo fresh and tasty. He gave us nice shrimp appetizer that I was surprised came with. The teppan is unique because they serve noodles. The rice came last after the food, which was nice because I hate filling up on rice before the main entree. But, the rice is definitely the best part of a teppan experience. I got too full by the time the rice came out and felt guilty not even touching it.

We went during happy hour and everything was reasonably priced. I ordered a shrimp tempura sushi and it cost $7, but it was a large well presented roll that tasted fresh and perfect. We were tempted to go for the all you can eat, but we held that off as Ricky wanted the happy hour teppan. It ended up costing us less. We are on a budget so we needed to by mindful of what we ordered even if we were treating ourselves. 

All in all I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriend's birthday and it was a wonderful experience! i tweeted to them beforehand because I'm not a huge sushi fan and I was afraid I wasn't going to find anything I like. They were reassuring and told me they'd alert the chef.
When we arrived, they had reserved a seat for us in front of the chef so he could guide me in my selections. He talked me through the kinds of fish I would like and wow, I loved everything he made for me. My boyfriend tried the ToroFest and said it was amazing. I don't think Ive ever seen him so happy with his meal. 
No, this is not the fastest place to eat. There is one man crafting your meal and the presentation is beautiful. But the place is small so the staff is easy to flag down to place another order. My water glass was never empty. Come here to enjoy the experience, enjoy your company and relax."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. the food is okay. the service is okay. it had problems with the demerits from the health dept. some pretty bad ratings from them so I don't go anymore"}
{"text":"On arrival we were told it would be 30 minutes before seats would be 
available, but the same meal could be prepared for us in the kitchen. We opted for this alternative rather than wait which turned out to be a big, big mistake. We started out with the edamame appetizer. This represented our first and last experience with boiled salted soybeans - totally tasteless. My wife chose the halibut dinner while I requested chicken. She received two decent sized pieces of fish, but each was overdone. My chicken, cut into  inch cubes, was dry. Each entree included miso soup, noodles, veggies, rice and salad. The soup was hot, but everything else was  served cold. Service was affable, but slow."}
{"text":"I just saw the news on their website - it's been a while since we've been in, due to other factors, but I sincerely hope that Fukuda will be back in full force soon, and especially so if they can continue on with the Izakaya theme rather than just straight up sushi. Yes, price point will also be important, but we really did enjoy the positive energy, conviction, and optimism that the staff served up with their dishes... Definitely keep that. Best of luck to you Fukuda-ites!!! Mata-ne!"}
{"text":"It isn't enough to come in and call Fukuda my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, and it isn't enough to say that I haven't had such an experience of fresh sushi or perfectly paired small plates anywhere else--I've been going to Fukuda for months, and yet I always get stuck when thinking about what to write for a review.

I've never asked for anything at Fukuda. I've yet to order off the menu a la carte, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Buy a bottle of liquor or wine or a six pack of beer, walk in with a friend or two, and sit at the sushi bar for an omikase. Yes, it's a bit expensive, but you're eating out and it's probably the best fish in the city. Pour your first glass and sit back and hang out.

You'll refill your drink as your first course comes out, and savor the combination of introductory tastes. Refill your drink, eat some ginger, and let the rest of the meal fall into place. 

Fukuda is a place to relax. It's my favorite place to hang out. I don't come in expecting to leave anytime soon, I don't mind if it takes a moment for my food to get to me, and the staff is never apprehensive to have a nice conversation or refill my glass.

The fois gras sushi that ended a portion of my omikase was stupid good, not to downplay the savory mushroom custard, the wagyu beef with wasabi mashed potatoes, the various cuts of tuna, or even the unbelievable black sesame creme brulee at the end of the meal.

This review is hardly enough. You should save up some funds and check out Fukuda; the place reviews itself."}
{"text":"Hands down the freshest fish in any sushi restaurant. With byob it's hard to tell how they turn a profit."}
{"text":"I was hungry and my eyes had grown glossy from starvation.  We had been driving in search of a particular restaurant, only to find out it had closed down.  I was hungry.  We drove past Fukuda and decided to give it a go.  The waiter mentioned they had just started offering an All-You-Can-Eat Sushi option ($19.95/lunch or $25.95/dinner) the day before.  Did I mention I was starving?  After a quick peek of the menu, I was easily sold.

It was slow when we walked in for an early dinner, and we were the only ones seated at the sushi bar.  After a slow start, our sushi chef (Steve) kept our plates filled.  What makes Fukuda a bit unique about their all-you-can-eat is that they offer sashimi!  Yes, it's one of those things you can only order once and so we did.  They offer Spicy Tuna Sashimi, Spicy Albacore Sashimi, and Spicy Salmon Sashimi.  What makes it spicy is the thinly sliced jalapenos, a dot of Sriracha sauce, and one other sauce they put on top of it.  Amaebi is also the one other thing that is a one time only, and it comes with the deep-fried heads too.

Appetizers we indulged in included the Baked Green Mussels, Shrimp Tempura and Soft Shell Crab (we got three orders!).  For nigiri, we had their Super White Tuna, Hotate, Masago with Uzura, Ikura, Saba, and Hamachi.  The Big F had two of their Salmon Skin Hand Rolls because Steve made their so enticingly good.  I made the mistake of getting the Lobster Roll.  I misunderstood and that it wasn't baked, but it was.  In the description, it's listed as \"Shrimp Tempura, avocado, cucumber and lobster on top.\"  However, it was filled with that crab mixture that I despise.  So blah on that one.  Other interestingly named rolls that we didn't get to try include Ugly Roll, Red Rock Roll, Green Valley Roll, and Dancing Eel.  There are a bunch of other rolls not included in the all-you-can-eat, including I Love Your Ass Roll, Monkey Brain Roll, and Flying Dragon Roll.

For dessert, choices include green tea or vanilla ice cream and mochi ice cream in Kona, mango, green tea, and strawberry.  The Big F really liked their Kona mochi, while I tried their mango, green tea, and strawberry.  The green tea one was a bit old, and I had to tell the waiter about it.  He apologized about it, and it really was no big deal.

Service was okay.  With us sitting at the sushi bar, we got our food pretty quickly.  They were good about clearing our plates and making sure the Big F's soda was refilled.  However, I had to ask the waitress to refill my tea cup every single time (four times).  I should have just asked for my own pot.

Fukuda is a pretty large restaurant with teppanyaki available should you so desire.  Apparently, many of their customers were asking about all-you-can-eat, so that's why they added it to their menu.  They also have a full bar available too.  Nonetheless, we were impressed because they offered sashimi and soft shell crab appetizer.  Let's see how long it lasts!

Update! 09.13.08 - The Big F called to ask something about their All-You-Can-Eat Sushi special and they discontinued it as of a couple of days ago!  Haha!  We knew it wouldn't last long!"}
{"text":"Ehhhhh.  I went here with my husband twice, and both times we were less than impressed with everything, especially for the price.  Good thing I've gotten out of it was the flavored wines.  Plum wine = awesome.  They often use krab, and there is a roll on the AYCE menu with filet mignon on top...that doesn't come with filet mignon.  Their jalapeno dish...I can't recall the name, but it is absolutely spicy.  left had side of the menu, something along the name of firecracker maybe...it was spicy.  Had a few of the other rolls and they were all average...nothing was \"Oh, I gotta go HERE for this roll!\" flavored.

Overall, I think I'm just spoiled with my favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and it has such a sleek look and great lighting that it's kind of impressive at first glance.

Great waiters and a very nice selection of specialty dishes and Sushi ( Ngiri and Roll ) My favorite was the Tuna Poki salad.  Tuna Poki is always a ME pleaser.  If you've never had it....it's chunks of Tuna Sashimi served on top of seaweed, usually in a sesame or ponzu dressing.  I do like it best when it's served the way they do it at Fukuda which is a salad style. Yum-eeeee!

It also has a Teppanyaki grill which makes it more of a family atmosphere.  So, not a recommendation for a quiet date night, but swell for a group of friends and maybe first time sushi eaters."}
{"text":"Given all of the really positive twitter buzz, I've really been wanting to try this place.  Still haven't had the chance to make it to dinner (yet), but was able to drop by for lunch.  Fukuda is very small and homey.  There's a sushi bar that looks like it would seat about 10 or so and only about 5 other tables.  Subtle wood and Asian decor cover the walls while quirky tunes play over the speakers.  

The lunch menu is very small.  There's grilled edamame, 3 kids of Ramen (pork, miso vegetarian, and seafood) and green tea to drink.  That's it.  Is that a problem?  Not when the food is delicious as Fukuda's.

My lunch companion and I split the grilled edamame.  Covered with sea salt, the grilling added quite a smokey flavor.  It's not something I'd had with edamame before, but it worked really well.  I opted for the standard pork ramen that also appears on the dinner menu.  With pork belly, egg, bamboo shoots, and scallions it was rich, flavorful, and delicious.  It blew the doors off of a recent $14 bowel of ramen I had at Station Street that smelled and tasted like formaldehyde-soaked frogs from 8th grade science class.  I noticed a bowl of seafood ramen being taken to a table next to us with a big prawn head sticking out of it.  Going to have to try that one next time.

After our meal, we had the chance to talk with one of the friendly owners for a bit.  He told us that he and and Matt (the sushi chef) were originally at Tamari.  They fly fresh fish in from Japan every Thursday.  The dinner menu is a combination of sushi/sashimi and robotayaki.  They also do an omakase that you have to reserve in advance.

As mentioned in other reviews, Fukuda is not cheap.  Our lunch today was about $30.  However, it was excellent and I really am looking forward to when I can make it back for dinner and try this amazing Japanese fish that keeps earning rave reviews."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great!!! The service is so good and the food is even better!
The teppanyaki servers are so fun and exciting!
The prices on the food are cheaper than any other restaurant around!!

I really really reccomend FUKUDA!"}
{"text":"OMFG SO GOOD!  Make sure you have the address for this place because it can be very easy to miss.  

It's a small place and pretty bare but I like it.  The food was pretty spectacular.  I had the ramen (can't find that too many places!) and 2 sushi rolls.  Vegans - the menu probably changes frequently but I had some vegan roll that was not your typical vegan roll.  It had sundried tomatoes in it and some other tasty stuff.  Have not been able to stop thinking about it.  I would definitely come back but only after I've saved up a little money - this place is EXPENSIVE!!!!  I do think they could go down a few dollars on the menu items because as good as the food was I don't think it's $$$ worthy.  Unless they made the portions bigger."}
{"text":"Read through mixed reviews but decided to give this place a try for a friends birthday not really knowing what to expect. Byob is great, service was attentive and our waiter was really nice about setting the expectation things come as they're ready. Loved the food. About $50 total for two people and we basically split about 7 things on the menu. Left not full but not uncomfortably and had a great time chatting that was complimented by some great flavors and very fresh sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi was great, the Robatayaki (basically yakitori) was even better. Every bite was a treat here, we were lucky to get a table!"}
{"text":"The second time around Fukuda was everything I had hoped for! 

We arrived at about 6:30 on Saturday and the place was almost half full for the small space but we were seated at a four person table for two immediately. 

We ordered:
Saba - marinated/blistered mackerel, pickled apple puree and grilled cucumber foam- this is a special item on the menu so would recommend trying now over the more 'staple' items
Robatayaki - scallion, kampachi and shiitake
Chef's Choice Sampler (small), highlights were the Opaka, Tuna and Roe (saltier than I've had)

The food was as I remembered delightfully tasty and light. No soy sauce needed on the nigiri and sashimi, which is how I like my sushi and a testament to Fukuda's craft. 

And the service was solid, such an upgrade from the prior experience. We were not forgotten this time.

Our bill came to ~$50 w/o tax and tip, which is extremely reasonable to me given what high quality food comes out of Fukuda."}
{"text":"Ehh...

We decided to try this local sushi/teppenyaki place for a friend's birthday. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service!

Different items were given at random times. The bento boxes came first, and all of the raw sushi (which doesn't require MUCH preparation!) came last...I seriously waited for more than an HOUR for my nigiri! It wasn't even a busy Thursday night! I noticed that the sushi chef was just serving those at the sushi bar, and the waitress didn't even try to bug the chef to hurry it up! I was the last one to receive my food! The food wasn't even that great either! The salmon nigiri was kind of slimy, and the spicy tuna was just alright; The rolls were seriously not worth the wait! The waitress tried to be nice later, after I told her that it took TOO long, and she gave us 4 bowls of green tea ice cream on the house....didn't really win me over...I still feel that I should have been comped for it...

We ended up staying at this crappy restaurant for almost 2 1/2 hours! I will never go here again! Please save yourself the trouble, and go somewhere that you know will have GOOD sushi (even if you have to drive far!)!"}
{"text":"How could I not have written a review before now of one of my favorite sushi restaurants??

From the very minute you walk through the door you are transported to Japan--less anyone Japanese working behind the sushi bar.  

You are greeted in a formal Japanese-style when you walk through the door, the chefs are working away vigorously at various beautiful cuts of fish and other delicacies that I am not so sure I could even name.  I had a great conversation about the importance of the various \"sides\" that go on the plate, and the fact that it's so disappointing to the chef that many people choose not to eat them--they're missing some of the great flavors!  

The late-night Okonomiyaki is what they're probably most famous for and definitely something you shouldn't miss if you can stay up that late.  Best part is they're open until I think 2 AM how can you go wrong with that?   I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The fish is flown in from Japan and this should make for some exceptional sushi, but it didn't. There are so many factors that go into a piece of sushi being delicious- freshness, temperature, cut of the fish, size of the portion, etc. We've only gone one time but it was not an impressive visit.  It was not bad by any means. We had heard all about this place and it just didn't live up to the hype. We didn't get anything from the kitchen, just sushi. We are not cheap eaters and Fukuda is over priced. Umi in Shadyside is WAY overpriced but I will go and enjoy because I know the sushi is second to none in this city. 

3 stars. Not bad, not remarkable"}
{"text":"I really truly believe there's no other place in the Burgh that matches what's going on here. It's incredibly unique and adventurous without being too scary for those who haven't had this type of food before. Don't worry, jump in, the waters warm:)

I also think this was the perfect time to visit, during restaurant week, because I was able to sample a lot of different things. I love me a good tasting menu (every restaurant should have one!). The tasting menu was $35 for sashimi, oysters, ramen and chocolate shiitake mushroom ice cream. Bummer, the ice cream ran out when we got there (we were there for 8:45pm reservations, so it was kinda sorta late). So they adjusted the price to $30 and I was happy to eat the rest of the choices!

I had heard the edamame was amazing, so we ordered that. It came out in a decent size bowl and was cooked with soy and sea salt. It was super tasty and we scarfed down the whole bowl. This is a no brainer when hitting this place up, so order up!

The 4 pieces of sashimi I slammed down were like butta. Seriously, fresh fish straight off the plane (literally, they get their fish flown in from Japan daily!). It was probably the freshest I've had other than Penn Ave Fish Co. The rice was fluffy but not too sticky. I'm gonna say straight up this was my fave part of the meal hands down. 

The 2 oysters were inventive. It was mixed with thai chili and lemon. Call me an old fashion oyster shucker (okay, maybe not shucker), but I like them either straight up, with cocktail sauce or vinegar. I may at some point find another sauce I like with them, but I don't think this was one of them.

The seafood ramen was good, but could have used a bit more flavor. It was very very fishy tasting. Don't get me wrong, I love fish. But just a warning for those of you who say you like fish, in small doses, this is not your dish. I did love the whole shrimp served in it. I'm not saying it just had the tails attached. I'm saying it had the eyeballs still staring at me! It was kinda gross popping that poor guys head off, but... it sure was delicious and fresh. Sorry my seafood friend! There was also a good amount of fish packed into the dish as well as noodles. Maybe just a little more pizzaz with the broth and we'd be in business.

So here's the hard facts. I came in fully prepared to fall in love. And while I did like it, and will most definitely come back for the sushi, the service was lacking. Everyone was extremely friendly, but I have an inkling our server forgot about our meals. 

There were five of us and two ordered sushi only and the rest of us ordered the tasting menu. The sushi came out promptly for all. Then that's where things fell apart. I think we waited almost 45 minutes for our oysters. I can understand if it was a cooked dish. I can understand if they were short staffed. But watching the tables around you receive all their courses before you even get your second, made us think we were forgotten. Once we reminded the server we received the oysters and then ramen shortly after.

I will say they brought us a tray of seared veggies and fish to make up for the botched service that were stellar. I'd actually recommend ordering that as an app if they have it on the menu when you visit. I've pretty  much planned my menu for the next visit. Edamame, seared veggies and fish and sushi, sushi, sushi! Oh and don't forgot your bottle of something, something. It's BYOB!"}
{"text":"As Bloomfield residents we were excited to have a new Japanese restaurant in our neighborhood. We enjoyed Fukuda's offerings during the Little Italy days and came in with high expectations. 

The place is very small but warm and inviting. The decor was very artful and creative giving you a feeling that you are somewhere special. Even down to the menu which was printed on a slim strip of paper which resembled a bookmark. It was simple, small and concise.  It felt very modern and Japanese...

So why am I only giving this place 3 stars? Its because we left unimpressed. Maybe we came in with high expectations and expected more for the price. However, I can't help how I feel.

I don't mind paying a top dollar for Japanese food but I felt blatantly ripped off. The sushi was decent but the servings were minuscule. I also ordered the simmered pork belly which was how I would have expected pork belly should be done. Which was quite good. However, for $ 10.50 I only got about 4 tiny little slivers. I devoured it. After polishing off the pork belly our overly enthusiastic server plopped down a larger serving of this glorious pork belly which had about 8 slivers less fatty and looked crispier. I was so happy thinking to myself oh this is a good deal. However, I was disappointed to find out that this second larger and better looking serving of pork belly was not really destined for our table, but the table next too us, thanks to my wife's honesty. This inconsistency is unacceptable when you are charging this much. And then it happened again. They kept on plopping down other people's food on our table. Which we declined.

Please improve. You might feel like you are doing well since the place looks packed every time I walk by during my dog walks. However, there is tough competition down the street and people are going to realize they are not getting their money's worth.

Your servings are half the size for almost double the cost and same quality as your competitor.  Please be consistent. I would like for you guys to stay in my neighborhood to improve our business district. We are in Pittsburgh, our market can't stand pretentious renditions of something that was already good to begin with. Sorry this is a late night rant. I woke up from sleep and started thinking about my experience at your place this evening.
