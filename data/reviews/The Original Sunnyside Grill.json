{"text":"I saw 3 really good reviews for this restaurant but I have to say my experience did not match the other reviewers.  We got there about 12:30 p.m. and there were several tables empty but dirty.  We took 1 of 2 tables that were clean.  The restaurant was about 3/4 full.  No one served us for the longest time.  The omlette we ordered had cheese, mushrooms & bacon and there was hardly any bacon. The french toast was not worth it at all.  No one came to refill coffee.  All the staff looked stressed and unhappy, no one was smiling, all frowns. They looked really understaffed.  Tables remained uncleared as more people came in waiting to be seated.  Wish I could give a good review but I don't recommend this place & I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here alot but lately their service has been really going on the down slope.  I don't think I will be coming any time sooner.  the last two times that I've been there it took them a while to give me my coffee, like when I go to other breakfast restaurants such as Sunset Grill, they first thing they ask if coffee or any drinks and they bring it right away. That time it took them a really long time, they served my food first before they served my coffee.  The second time, my husband  asked for coffee and the server re-filled his but didn't re-fill mine when you could see that mine was empty. That same time, they added ham in my husband's omelette when he asked for no bacon, he is vegetarian, anyway they gave him a replacement meal, he requested just eggs and home fries, his second plate  was below par, small eggs and very little home fries, and they charged us for the omelette instead. We paid for the omelette.  Anyway, the food was good but I'm still really annoyed at the service."}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast restaurant in Northeast Oakville.  Clean, comfortable, friendly staff and good value for money breakfasts (especially if you go there weekdays before 10:00 am). Food is usually higher quality to begin with and not over done.  Example: sausages still look like sausages and taste very good, not like burnt and dried up jerky."}
{"text":"Came here after purchasing a Wag Jag and was pleasantly surprised. Restaurant was clean and new. Good quality breakfast items at reasonable prices.  Moreover, my eggs were poached perfectly, which is no small feat for breakfast places these days.  They are still working out the kinks of a new restaurant (with servers etc),  but overall a good experience. We will be back for breakfast again."}
{"text":"It was obvious the owners were not at  the Prince William Oakville location the day before Canada Day as the only young waitress was more interested in doing nothing than waitng tables .In the past nothing but 5 stars but today we started with coffee stains on our cup and no watress to complain to .WATCH YOUR YOUNG STAFF..Also no service equals no tip.And when you do not get a tip do not pout.Will return but I will make sure the owner is there.Update.This location has changed owners and they are very friendly.Back to five stars again."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday morning in January and were immediately impressed with the creating we received, the bright and clean areas and the extensive menu.    The food lacked that \"something special\" but overall tasted good.  It was hot and fresh and served quickly.  The family that has taken over this place were all super friendly and grateful for the business.  We were surprised that a drink was not included for the kids menu.  One kid meal ended up costing more than a regular menu order once the drink was added.  That said, the portions were huge and we got great overall value for our money.  We will absolutely be back though and will recommend this place to anyone looking for a great breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"There was only one server, one cook and one other person cleaning up the tables when we got there and I thought service was going to be slow.   However once we ordered, the food came out very quickly and the temperature was hot and the food tasty. I had the poached  eggs and it was perfectly done and the Canadian back bacon was thick and tasty. The potatoes that came with it was also very nicely done with the right amount of crispy ness to it. The pancakes were also fluffy and the waffles were freshly made.   Their menu certainly revolves around eggs as you can also order hamburgers and fries with eggs + hollandaise sauce on them. I think I will try that next time.   The service is good despite only one server who was also the cashier. The server even managed to come by and refill my coffee while she was running around taking orders and bringing food to the tables.   No wonder the place was full at 11am on a Friday morning."}
{"text":"I really like this place when it first opened.  I found recently that they put the prices up and don't have as many specials as they used to have. My girlfriend and I met for breakfast and we were disappointed when we were charged an extra $3.99 for a small dish of hollandaise sauce. The service was really good and so I tipped based on that but I thought $19 for breakfast was a bit extreme!  I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Meh, food was okay but NOT worth the price. Also, wait staff wasn't that great, most diners and breakfast places I've been to (breakfast is my favorite meal) have a cheery wait staff, however at sunny side grill everyone shows their frustration stress and morning grumpiness on the weekend we went. Wasn't that appealing to want to come back... Sad too because i wanted it to be my weekend spot!"}
{"text":"Finally!!  A brekkie place north of Dundas in Oakville!!  So tired of Smittys and a change from Cora's.  The locale used to be a failed Licks x 2.  Yes they were suckers for restaurant failure...  Nice and bright if a bit noisy with sound bouncing off the walls.  There were more people in here in a Sunday am than all the  Licks patrons in the last 2 years I think.  Great prices on standard fare.  Ordered the trad breakfast and southern omelette.  Coffee was a bit weak.  Food was slow to come.  Going to chalk it up to startup hiccups this time around.  Omelette cooked perfectly not overdone!! Nice side of crispy fried taters.  Eggs over easy looked perfect and not greasy at all."}
{"text":"Great breakfast fast and courteous staff would recommend price a bit high for a breakfast but what isnt nowadays"}
{"text":"A very clean diner and slightly more modern than Sunset Grill.  I had a Groupon for this place ($10 for $20) and there was no issues redeeming it.  So that's cool.  Anywho, came here with my mom for a weekend breakfast and we ordered:  -Traditional Combo: 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, potatoes and toast - $6.99 -Poached Eggs Swiss (comes with potatoes) - basically eggs benedict but with chicken, ham and Swiss cheese.  - $9.99 -2 coffees - $2.29 each  I thought the bacon was really salty, but this is coming from someone who rarely eats bacon (and doesn't like it much either).  I didn't try anything besides that  on my mom's dish.  As for the poached eggs Swiss, the hollandaise sauce was okay, but the eggs were poached perfectly and they gave you an option of soft, hard or medium.  It was decent tasting.    With regards to the coffee, while no match for any self respecting coffee shop, it is better than Sunset Grill.  So I'd give the food a 3.5/5  Service: The waitress came around at least 4-5 times to see if we needed refills, so that was appreciated.  4.5/5  Verdict: Due to the lack of breakfast places in Mississauga/Oakville, I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time and absolutely loved it ordered steak eggs Hollandaise and it was deliciouss!!"}
{"text":"This breakfast joint has no frills and that's no problems.  It offers typical, affordable breakfast foods at a reasonable price.  The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because the cook was on his cell phone the whole time he was preparing my meal.  It's no big deal, it was just odd to see."}
{"text":"We often go here on our way north early Saturday morning. The waitress is great cheery and with coffee in hand.  The breakfast is great fast and the price is right very good food tasty and great crispy bacon. Service is excellent."}
