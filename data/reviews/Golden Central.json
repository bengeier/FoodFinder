{"text":"Long time supporters of this restaurant but went there after new years and were very disappointed.  Food was not hot, menu has changed (the sticky rice was gross), certain other items we were told were not available.  When I noted these things to the owner, they simply shrugged it off."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Golden Central for months and finally stopped in today for dim sum. The large restaurant was about 1/3 full on a Monday, which I considered to be a good sign given it's location. Almost all of the patrons were Chinese, which is another good sign. The dim sum was good and the price was about the same as most dim sum places in Calgary. The service was friendly and efficient. I would go back for dim sum and will try the place some evening in the not too distant future for dinner."}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful staff. A preponderance of crepe items on the dim sum menu if that's your thing. Fairly good food prep and OK prices earn them 3 stars, but will have to try again at dinner, as this is what my friends raved about."}
{"text":"Had dim sum here a while back with friends.
Food was okay, though there was not too much variety
Service was satisfactory."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this restaurant twice. Once for supper on a weeknight, and once for dim sum lunch on a Saturday.

I agree with most of the reviews regarding the service - it's not great - they are abrupt and don't communicate well. I would forgive this in a second if the food was better.

The food is ok, but not great and not the best in Calgary. Some items are tasty, but we found it was too bland for us. The dim sum menu had a lot of rice noodle, and it's not our favourite, so we were disappointed there were not more options that we enjoy on the menu.  The food is overly salty. At dim sum we were not given any sauces.

The restaurant is large, but lacks atmosphere. It was too cold the first time we were there, and the second time it was way too hot.

{"text":"The food is decent, but the worst part of every experience I've had at this restaurant is the service. Never go on a weekend or a stat holiday because it will be busy. When it is busy, this restaurant fails to manage both its kitchen and staff. There have been many occasions in which my family has reserved a table only to arrive and be told that our table isn't ready. Furthermore, the food will take far too long to come out. We were at the restaurant for over 2 hours for lunch and most of the time was spent waiting for the food. They are incapable of serving all the customers when the place is full. Therefore, they should either hire more staff or turn customers away. After several abysmal experiences, I will never return to the restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to pass by this restaurant on the way to music lessons, but my family and I only recently decided to eat here. It was almost painfully empty, with only three tables occupied, and a haggle of staff waiting at the front entrance.

Our soup took about twenty minutes to arrive, and it was virtually tasteless. The chicken was good, but it was extremely salty. Just as we were about to leave, the waiter arrived with our last dish (fried veggies). 

Upon requesting for take-away boxes, the waiter gave us a dirty look, and gave a snarky comment on how little we ate.  But quite honestly, we didn't like the food at all. Later, I got soup spilled over my white band uniform, because one of the staff tried to pick up all the bowls at once. I ended up walking out of there with bits of egg in my hair.

Yet another disappointing restaurant to add to the list of bad Chinese restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"Started off pretty badly, water wasn't hot enough to adequately steep the tea, even after I asked a staff member to replace the water it was overly bland. Food was ok, so far, kinda the same issue as with the tea, not quite hot enough. Then we finally got our sui mai, and I was happily chewing on a piece, when i noticed something solid and thin in my mouth. I pulled out, wait for it.... A PIECE OF STEEL WOOL. Notified a staff member immediately, 3 of them still had the audacity to ask me if I wanted them to replace it with another basket. Not even a \"Sorry about that.\" Are you joking me? How do you expect me to have an appetite to eat any more after finding a piece of cleaning apparatus in my food? Ended up only refunding the purchase price of that one basket. Seriously, that's it. What a joke, I suppose they don't want to retain customers. My appetite sucked for a week after that. Central Grand has always been great anyways. Never. Again."}
{"text":"This was the worst service and Chinese food I've ever had. Our bill came to $150 for two people. We waited an hour for our food, it wasn't even busy there. When the food came they forgot two dishes and brought out the rice after we ate the salty crab and disgusting egg yolk fried shrimp and the rest of the other mediocre dishes. No one there could understand or speak English. When we ordered we had to point to the menu and the guy read the Chinese part to understand. I think it's disgusting that you work in Canada but can't be bothered to learn English. When we complained to the manager he said I don't understand. We wil never go back. There are far better Chinese restaurants in Calgary that deserve and appreciate our patronage. I'm sure English would be a requirement. I puked on the way home because of their fried shrimp. I do not recommend this restaurant. I would give zero stars but it was not an option."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed until my friend held her son's 100 day dinner celebration here. The restaurant is quite big, even with 4 tables of 10 reserved they were still able to accommodate other diners while we were there.

She had the traditional 10 dish dinner, and all the food came out at a good pace and were really tasty. 

I took a take out menu with me, along with some suggestions from my girlfriend on dishes she's tried. I'll definitely keep this place in mind the next time I'm craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"The food is very good overall. The service is disgusting and rude.The lady that works there , she may be the owner, is very rude and abrupt. So be aware of the slow service and bad attitude from the staff, if you are considering going there.She probably has some personal issues that she needs help with."}
{"text":"This is my favourite spot for ginger beef in Calgary. To be fair, I've never dined in, only pick up, and I've never deviated much from ginger beef, ginger chicken, and stir fried vegetables.  I like the crispiness of the dishes, sauce Is served on the bottom, or on the side, so you get to choose how much sauce you want, and food doesn't get soggy in transit. Staff have always been on point and pleasant when I've visited."}
{"text":"Yum yum. Dim Sum. 

Casual, efficient service, clean environment. Came here for lunch with several of my work mates. 

Staff was friendly and fast. The food was very good. I have had better dim sum. But Golden Central is a delicious centrally located option if you're north of downtown. 

Lots of parking. Lots of tables. Worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty good Dim Sum spot in Calgary. Came on the recommendation of several Chinese and other friends. Good, fresh food, lots of variety on their dim sum menu, lots of things that they don't have at most of the other dim sum places in town. 10 varieties of rice crepes, lots of rice and noodle options, lots steamed options. Their food doesn't taste too MSG like and not bland.

Not sure why everyone's complaining so much about service, it's a Chinese restaurant, what do you expect?? But actually our service was pretty good compared to other Chinese restaurants, but definitely not fine dining service, which is fine."}
{"text":"This place was packed the day we went since 2 tour groups from China reserved 90% of the restaurant. Thankfully we reserved a table too.

The food here is good - oddly though they don't give free rice, something which I guess I'm accustomed to in the US chinatowns. We got a lot of stuff - beef flat noodle, braised pork belly, fish roe fried rice, snow pea leaves, peking style pork chops, mapo tofu, coconut shrimp, deep fried chicken and fish maw soup. All were excellent. Out of the dishes, the ones that really stood out to me were the fish maw soup, coconut shrimp and deep fried chicken. Can't really go wrong in any way though.

bonus: it's outside of chinatown so less traffic, don't have to pay for parking and you get food just as good. Woot."}
{"text":"This place is just going downhill... and the smaller crowds and fewer staff reflect this and so does my rating on the restaurant.  This update to my review reflects several visits that I have had there since my last update.  The food itself is more or less the same quality as before, so I won't talk about it again.  It is the other, potentially small details that is slowly killing this restaurants if they are not corrected quickly, as there are now other competitors in the north.  

The biggest thing they need to keep an eye on is the speed that the food comes out... this happens every time I have been there recently and probably due to fewer staff in the kitchen.  To eat a normal Chinese meal, if I am there for more than 2 hours  it is taking too long.  

Another problem is customer service.  They gotta put someone more competent on the phone.  Offending a patron on the phone is not only annoying to the potential customer, it will definitely come back to haunt you.  If there isn't a table that the customer can reserve, just say it and not say it in a  'smart ass' way that will ensure the customer to go elsewhere and never come back.  Also if the food is slow, just say it and not say it is coming out, when we both know that it is not.

Finally, the last time I was there at the restaurant, the temperature inside the restaurant was 27 degrees.  The restaurant was packed because of a banquet, but someone should have turned on the a/c."}
{"text":"This is our favourite Chinese food place in the vicinity. Their selection of Western Chinese  is very good. It's a little on the expensive side, but I'd say it's worth it every time. The fried rice is unequaled."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for dim sum.  You order your food from a sheet.   This restaurant actually had a quite a few options for vegetarian dim sum. The food is always pretty decent but I always find this restaurant really cold. The rice rolls were the stand outs out of the items we ordered this time."}
{"text":"We've driven past this resturant a billion times but have never gone in until today. I was surprised that there was no wait for a Sunday lunch. The resturant was bigger than expected. We got a table for 6 all to ourselves. So much leg room!

The dim sum menu had a good selection of items on it. I love how they arranged the most commonly ordered items to be a the top of yhe list. The dim sum menu was in both Chinese and English, some spelling mistakes here and there but over all easy to understand. We were disappointed to see that there were no egg tarts available at this resturant to order. 

We got some of our usual items. The \"crab meat & pork dumplings\" were a bit dry on the top, but the flavour was on point. We loved how fluffy the \"steamed bbq pork buns\" were. The flavour of filling was perfect, but lacking in quantity, the bun to filling ratio was way off. 

The \"plain rice crepes\" were dripping in oil, and fell apart when we tried to pick it up. I think they ran out of nice plates to serve on as the plate we got the food on didn't look like it should have belonged in the restaurant at all...

The lady dish we got were the \"pan fried pork buns\". I knew that these would come a bit oiled up to begin with... But the amount of oil present on these were not okay. There was no crisp to the bottom layer of the buns at all. 

Throughout the meal I was gulping down their tea nonstop. Such thirst from eating their food. Overall not a terrible experience, open to trying their dinner menu should I need a last minute place to go to."}
{"text":"I'd have to say this is one of my favorite dim sum places in Calgary. The dim sum is ordered from the checklist sheet vs being pushed around the carts, which is good if you know what you want, because it comes out piping hot, just the way I like it. I usually just get the usual staples to judge the quality and I find the taste of the dim sum excellent and enjoyed all of the dishes that we ordered."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Golden Central.  It was really, really good!  The finer end of Chinese cooking.  We started to order from the menu when the waitress told us that the restaurant was having a special.  If we order 2 dishes from the menu except the soup, we can get to pick 1 dish out of the 4 dishes that have special prices like Kwei Fee Kai (Royal Simmered Chicken) for only $10!   The other 3 dishes was beef, shrimp and ginger & onion crab for only $12.95!  What a deal!

We ordered the fish maw soup with bamboo piths, snow pea leaves in garlic sauce, satay beef with vermiceli hot pot, E-Fu noodles in XO Sauce.  We decided on the chicken for $10!  Well-cooked and so good."}
