{"text":"This is a great little place with excellent food at decent prices. It is now called Satiasian. The schezuan beef is delicious."}
{"text":"MASSIVE portion sizes here. Food itself is pretty no frills. Similar to what you would expect from a noodle shop in Chinatown, only without making the hike over that way.   Restaurant itself is clean, nice decor, friendly and fast staff.   A good place to go if you're craving some greasy Vietnamese spring rolls and noodles/soup."}
{"text":"Excellent West Queen West Vietnamese.  Generous portions and excellent food.  Nice fresh veggies, really flavourful broth in the Pho and the Bun is also great.    Good decor, nice and quiet, good service.  I don't know what else to say - No complaints whatsoever!"}
{"text":"OKAY.  This place was a very pleasant surprise for me - maybe it was because my expectations were so low (I mean, the others Viet places in Parkdale has turned out to be less than wonderful), but it is certainly worth many a return visit.  I can tell you right away that it didn't start out with me being a fan; I sat  down( which means you have like, 5 minutes to bring me water and menu) and nobody came. I was extra grouch cuz I was starved; hungry Shyni is a angry Shyni. I finally get some tea (which was hot and I had to wait for it to cool down a little so I got grumpier by the minute) and ordered food; cold spring rolls and vegetables with noodles.  It took a while - did I mention I have no patience when it comes to food?  I mean I was starrrrrved. STARVED. FAMISHED. I seriously thought about eating the table.  Anyway, when the rolls arrived, everything was made fine - I don't know that I've tasted a better cold roll before this - maybe at Pho Hung's but that's really because I made it myself there. It was just about the right proportion, bursts of flavour and crunchiness. When I got my Vegetables with tofu and vermicelli, it really didn't jerk my appetite - it was rather BLAND visually. Adding the sauce I was still sort of in doubt until I stuffed some in my mouth. AGAIN, right amount of crunchies, flavours and texture. IT was delicious.  She had forgotten the spring roll that was supposed to come with my meal and brought it to me which made for a delicious after bite.  I noticed then the open set up of the restaurant which w as also pleasing.  My friend even commented that he's never seen me wait for food for so long and not bitch.  I really don't know if that was planned; making people wait for food so the appreciation rate is high - or it is simply that there was just the two of them, I really don't know but it worked in their favour and shut me up good. Moreover, I know that I will be returning there. Very soon. Like, tomorrow."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious with a pleasant ambiance to boot, Noodle Menu is a hidden gem on a club heavy block.  Broth is amazing.  But you better go fast or it will be too discovered or out of business."}
{"text":"Best fresh/spring rolls I have ever had! They call them \"sexy rolls\" Restaurant had interesting decor. Ran out of ingredients when I tried to order more fresh rolls. They used ketchup for pad thai sauce.   Just go for the sexy rolls and get them to go!"}
