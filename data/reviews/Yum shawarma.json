{"text":"Worst shawarma ever. Bought chicken plate, beef plate and chicken wrap. All tasted bad and bitter. Had to throw away all the food. What a waste."}
{"text":"This is a small but very nice Shawarma place.  However, they also serve Pakistani food.  My husband and I split a chicken shawarma plate and absolutely loved it. Good portion and very moist chicken.  My kids ordered the chicken burger and devoured it.  We also ordered chicken wings and fries which were sub par.  Overall I will be going back with my family. The staff was very pleasant and restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"One of the best things i like about a family owned place is the perfection they try to achieve with every meal and the customised service!  Ordered : chicken shawarma dinner and desi burger. The dinner was good with good quantity chicken and a good mix of sauces and veggies. The what i loved was the burger i had. The patty cake is extremely soft melt in the mouth and is not to be missed.  Cost for 2 : $20-25 To try : fish dinner, chicken wings"}
{"text":"Fantastic Pakistani spin on traditional Shawarma. The restaurant is located in a busy plaza with lots of other restaurants. Was in the area, and decided to give it a shot because I was looking for a 'healthy' option. Protein and salad.   Ordering was easy, although it did take a few mins for the gentleman who was serving me to acknowledge me. While I was waiting, the phone rang, the guy picked it up, but thankfully he put them on hold to take my order.   Was served up some delicious chicken and some salad consisting of ice berg lecture, diced tomatoes and dived cucumbers. Turnips, hummus, tahini, hot sauce, garlic sauce and hot peppers were also offered as accompaniments.   There was also an ample portion of rice as well.   The chicken was super tasty. A lot of place serve bland chicken but the spices were fantastic here. The salad was also delicious but the highlight for me was the hot sauce. Authentic, home made, delicious hot sauce that is not too spicy (for me at least) but definitely had a nice kick to it.   $10.99 for shawarma was a bit on the pricy side but I would rather pay a bit more and get quality than to pay a bit less and not be happy with my meal.   If I'm in the area again, I'll definitely be passing by."}
{"text":"Great taste with a desi touch. I had the chicken shawarma plate. Very filling. The restaurant owner is a nice guy and takes pride in his work."}
{"text":"The 'Chicken Shawarma Plate' served on fries had chicken that was tender and moist and was sufficiently covered with a delicious garlic sauce. The dish has a subtle unique flavor that distinguishes it from other shawarma platters.  I was happy that I also tried the vividly pink Kashmiri Chai tea which was creamy and sweet, garnished with pistachios and almonds."}
{"text":"I'm from Saudi. I had falafel combo with fries and a drink. The falafel is good, soft and moist. Not too saucy. The fries were commercial, probably Costco? Which isn't bad since I like Costco fries. My sister had the poutine and it wasn't bad either, not too salty. The poutine gravy to cheese ratio was good. I would reorder. Service unknown since I didn't order in person. Ordered via \"SkipTheDishes.\""}
