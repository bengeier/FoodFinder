{"text":"I would not go to this restaurant cozy of the service, even on less busy day the service is terrible. The servers don't even bother to take orders over sitting for 30 mins and nobody coming to get order I decided to leave. That was last visit to this place, food is good but service omg terrible."}
{"text":"Amazing food their goat curry ,Butter chicken ,fish pakora are always my favourite ,I love their sweets and no doubt their food is always fresh and tastes great ,there is huge selection for veg and non veg , highly recommended"}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Their butter chicken, veggie chicken, dal, channa are really good.  You should try their Amritsari kulcha and channa bhatura which are really good. For Catering is very beat and cheap."}
{"text":"The food is great, fresh and delicious...however they always seem to get my order incorrect. The wait times are really long especially during peak hours. Most people don't mind as the food is worth it. I just wish they could get the orders right!!"}
{"text":"Very good for takeout and the best quality sweets and chaat dishes. Wouldn't recommend to dine in. Not so good service compare to others. I didnt try anything else than these though but based on it im sure the rest of dishes would be tasty too. + good food + not expensive + best sweets so far  - ambience  - customer service"}
{"text":"More people  less space ,feels cramped in there .   The. waitresses dont have any knowledge of waitering , they are haphazard , and non polite bunch. The manager seem to be either not aware or just turns a blind eye on it or may be his hands are tied. They should be hiring proffesional waitering staff . The food is good .prices are cheap, I think that is the only reason they STILL getting indian customers   (majority of people living in the area are indians)  who will compromise  to bad service for good deal ."}
{"text":"Really dull and tasteless food. We ordered the mysore masala dosa, bhel puri, aaloo tikki and chana bhatura. All of them tasted really bland and too sweet. Quantity was good but at the expense of quality. One of the worst Indian restaurants I've been to in a very long time."}
{"text":"As a student on a tight budget, I'm always on the hunt for a cheap meal.  Not only is this place inexpensive, but the portions are huge and delicious!   I had the chicken biryani Tuesday special today.  There had to be equal to an entire chicken's worth of meat in this dish!  So much flavour too.  I'm so full I probably won't need to eat for the rest of the day.  The crazy part was that it was only $5.   I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"the owners need to take the quality control seriously. Lot of these Indian restaurants think that they can serve anything to the customers and they will gulp it down without any questions.  If you are taking out, make sure you CHECK your food before leaving. Recent example of burnt Naans they handed out to me that I noticed only after reaching home. And the cooks do not wear gloves while handling the food. this is so unhygienic.   I tried talked to the manager, Seema, and she did not even have time to address the issue and hung up.   Not sure what quality measures they are taking in the kitchen bit it would be a serious health issue if someone eats and falls sick."}
{"text":"Ive been here many many times.  This place has the best Channa Masala / Cholleh Patureh!  I had a thaali once, and I wouldn't have it again.  I now Only eat the choleh patureh."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I have been to which creates a fuss on changing a table once you have ordered. I mean if the table is not comfortable, you just have to change it.   Place lacks customer service big time and because they have a couple of plaques on the wall with components they seem to flying on cloud nine.   Servers are outright rude and the manager tried his best to be polite but failed miserably.   Food is mediocre....yes it's cheaper compared to other there are definitely better places to eat in Brampton that treat their customers well.   Won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"The food is good portion wise and taste wise as well. The prices are very fair and they have a 15% of for Sheridan College students.   My only trouble with this establishment is that the service is extremely slow. Every time we dine in the restaurant, whether it's a small or large order, we have to wait quite a while. They don't seem to be understaffed but perhaps need to provide better training to the servers.   Other than that, their meat/veg thali, Channa bhatura, pav bhaji, chat papdi are all very good. I tried the Masala chai today and it was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Pros: The food here is delicious with good prices. Cons : It takes an awful amount of time for your food to arrive. If you are in hurry then this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Food quality has improved since I was there last.  Very delicious but the wait for take out was at least 45 minutes. The place is so poorly organized with orders I think it's just best to call your order in ahead of time.  No wait and no chaos. I do like the newly renovated eat in section but arrive before the rush periods because the food is very popular!"}
{"text":"This place would get 4-5 stars if they could get their service down right.  The food is one of the best in Brampton and cheap. You will often find a line to or out the door for the little tables they have.   This is the problem I noticed with their service;  - tables look long to clean, which caused the folks waiting in line to get cranky.  - we had to wait for a menu for like another 5-10 mins.  - ordered our food, one our orders was messed up.  - repeat process and you start seeing rd problem with the staff here.  This restaurant either needs to do a better job of training or hire more staff, as I have never seen so many happy people sitting in a restaurant.  But if you want take out, the food is awesome."}
{"text":"This review is for a small order and not the main food items sold here.   Picked a Paneer Paratha that comes with a raita (yogurt and boondi-mini chick pea flour balls) and some paneer pakodas.   The restaurant was super just before 9 pm and guess that is dinner time for most of the patrons and students that were around. Lots of take outs and tables almost full.   The order took a lot longer than it should have. Many thali orders with flew out that were orders well after.   The paneer paratha was big, but the paneer was way too thin spread. Would have preferred the paratha to bit smaller but with a slightly thicker layer of paneer. In some morsels all we could taste was dough and no paneer.   The pakoras were perfectly fried and had a thin layer of chutney hot sauce that provided a good flavour. The outer batter not too thin and not too thick and was perfect. Do want to try all the rest of food specially the Chinese Thali that I believe I can't get anywhere.   Updated Oct-2017 visit Ordered a Vegetarian Chinese Thali, Vegetarian Indian Thali and a Paneer Paratha. The Chinese Thali Food. Are out piping hot. The Fried Rice and Vegetarian Manchurian was OK if compared to a genuine Hakka Restaurant, however for a Punjabi Restaurant it was good. The Vegetarian Chilli was amazing with Veggie Soy pieces, which is missing in almost all Punjabi restaurants and definitely even in Hakka Restaurants. The Indian Thali was good, but found the dishes lacked flavour and seasonings. The quantity in both Thalis was very good. The Paneer Paratha was between than last time. Paneer stuffing perfect.   Never got to see the bill, but was told the amount that I paid on plastic. Didn't think at the time, however after the fact it seems suspicious."}
{"text":"The best tandoori fish I have had in ling time - better than what you would get in Michigan and California - and trust me when I say that (coming from a foodie person!). Amritsari naan was not to shabby either.  The place is not fancy but good portions and fantastic cooking"}
{"text":"We went here at 11:20 pm after a hospital visit and were very happy that it was open at that time as we were very hungry. Overall, it is a convenient place to get food.  We ordered the Masala dosa and cokes. It was mediocre, however the reason for a lower rating would be the service. The girls that were serving would put everythng on the other table including drinks and didn't bother putting it on our table which was disapponting."}
{"text":"Consistent in quality n portioning . Truest Indian punjabi cuisine . We eat 3 to 4 times a month after trying few Indian restaurants in the vicinity we come back here !"}
{"text":"Good food for price. This place has very reasonable prices and good quality and tasting food. I would not say it is the best tasting or selection, but for the price to quality ratio I would say one of the best in Brampton. They also have daily deals that are great! Try their full tandoori chicken and tell them you want it juicy!"}
{"text":"Food is good but their servers are clueless,they need to go for hotel management, for service it's failed otherwise  nice and cheep food around Brampton area, only good in take out all focus they have on take out"}
{"text":"I love the food here. But try not to go and order during the evenings. It will be absolutely packed with people. Since its a small restaurant, not much space to sit down and eat, the tables are always taken. Call and order your food. The staff, I feel is very overwhelmed sometimes with the people ordering, and they can't handle it, wait times can vary from 20 minutes to even nearing 1 hour (I have actually waited that long) But the food is amazing and that's why I come back everytime. 3 stars for me."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat Indian food, specially veggie thali or veggie samosas . They have mango lassi and yogurt lassi too. The chana Bathura is good too. Its a clean place and i go there often ."}
{"text":"Pros - Pretty good food             cheap or I can say cheapest food  cons - small space and always crowded             slow service"}
{"text":"If I've said it once, I've said a thousand times. Brampton should be called \"Browntown\". As a fellow Indian, coming here to visit relatives is like living in India with a developed infrastructure. With a large, overwhelmingly South Asian contingent, the number and quality of Indian restaurants makes this city one of the best to get this kind of food. This review is for the second time eating here. My relatives and I all ordered a variety of dishes take-out and shared it with one another. I ordered a keema naan that came with gravy (2.49?) and an order of chicken makhni (8.99). Either way for 11-12 dollars, a quality meal but from what I hear from regulars, this establishment's rice dishes is below mediocre. Keeping that mind, all of the other dishes that we ordered were well above expectations."}
{"text":"Wow, i think this is one of the worst restaurant experiences EVER!  As some of the other reviews mention, the servers are beyond clueless...  Our appetizers came after our main courses and we ordered the app's 30 mins before the main course... When i asked them to cancel the app's, they said it was too late...     Food was blah!  couple of things were ok, but the majority a major fail!    And the place was bloody filthy! Just gross...  I think the health inspector should pay a visit...  Our plates came dirty...  there were 10 of us there, and they gave us 5 napkins...  I asked for more, and they brought dirty one... EEK!!!   Stay away..."}
{"text":"Decent  food for a decent  price. Not  consistent in their food. Some times it's great and sometimes  just terrible.  Takes  forever to order and receive food."}
{"text":"Horrible Place  Used to be good place  Customer service needs a change  Food quality is worst now  I have the mashed eggplant here but it was burned eggplant not mashed"}
