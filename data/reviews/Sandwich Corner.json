{"text":"Just found this place a couple weeks ago...been here a few times.  I got the cheese steak it was ok..had a good portion of meat...not bad.... Also had the ruben it was good as well. I dig a bargain so I go between 2-4pm, sandwiches are half price.  Today I got the Ruben, waffle fries and a soda, under $6....can't beat it...."}
{"text":"This place is a great find. Great Cheesesteak sandwich and wonderful fries.. and I love good fries. Wife loves the turkey Reuben! Cook staff is on top of it but some of the counter help has been unacceptable... So bad that my wife pokes fun at me that the food must be my favorite to put up with the counter hassles.  They have self order stations that are pretty cool but the stations don't support adding lettuce to my Cheesesteak. ;(  Try this place.. You too will become a regular."}
{"text":"Truly great fast (but freshly made) food.  Three of us went in after a tennis match and ordered three different combos off the menu.  Each one was fantastic (my western burger was awesome).  Service was very good.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had a Roast Beef Sandwich and optioned out of the horse radish and their flavored spread.  I was hoping to get freshly sliced roast beef on some good Sourdough bread, but I got what appears to be prepackaged meet, picture Subway Roast Beef, and some dry bread that resembled a grocery store generic brand.  Now, the winner in the basket was te homemade chips, they were very crisp and good.  When I spend over $10 for a sandwich, chips and drink, I expect better quality ingredients.  Their drink machine is cool, sort of a limited Coke Freestyle.  Anyhow, would I go back, probably not.  I could drive a little further to a Jersey Mike's or up to Huntersville to Bagel Bin."}
{"text":"Just went here after a soccer game at Strikers. Initially I though this would be a part of the 7-11 but it's actually a small shop next to the 7-11. 
They have a good variety of sandwiches and you can personalize your order yourself. They have stations where you can pick what you want, select the bread, make any substitutions and pay. So efficient! No waiting in lines, asking questions to the cashier while holding up people behind you in line. 
We had a Philly cheesesteak and Babe (pulled pork bbq). Both were delicious and were ready in reasonable time. The soda/water dispenser is pretty fancy and the bathrooms are very clean. So thankful for having found a good post-soccer sandwich place!"}
{"text":"This is not a regular sandwich shop, this is the real deal! Fantastic Philly cheesesteak! High quality ingredients executed to perfection! Even the bread is spot on!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now and will be back again. The fries are good and have a very tasty seasoning on them. Sandwiches are cooked to order so they come out hot and fresh. I have had the cheese steak and Italian sub and both were very good."}
