{"text":"I've been back several times since my first visit and the food and service are just as good. Drive-thru is very convenient.  We've tried several more variety of tortas and the hard tacos and nothing has disappointed us.   We've noticed that the tortas are better if you can eat them there because the bread gets a little soggy on the transport home but they still have the same great taste."}
{"text":"While flipping through last year's 50 Best Dishes issue of Phoenix Magazine, I saw that this place won the 'Best Sandwich' category. Being not only a fan of sandwiches but tortas specifically, I had to check this place out. A friend of mine treated me to The Cubana, the award-winning sandwich. It was good looking but not as handsome as the sandwich pictured in the magazine (not surprising). Torta half in one hand (it was big) and a chile toreado in the other (Free at the salsa bar!  Win!), I began to pig-out.  While I was chowing on the delicious, grilled-to-crisp roll filled with various pork products, queso fresco, avocado and the usual sandwich veggies, my friend asked, \"Is it number one?\" I replied with a peace-sign gesture, the number two. Though the sandwich tasted good, was worth the price and is my new fast-food of choice while in the Arcadia area, it does not trump The Del Rey from Los Reyes De La Torta, overall. However, Los Reyes is a full-service joint and consuming more then one Del Rey in a three-month period will result in morbidly high cholesterol numbers. Thus, I will no doubt be dragging my friend to Tortas El Guero, regularly."}
{"text":"Such a shame but a sign of our times to be sure, this location of Tortas El Guero has closed it's doors. The locations in Phoenix and Mesa remain open and are still supplying us with delicious food!"}
{"text":"P.S. they have a drive thru! Though this is how it works, you call ahead, place your order with one of the really nice folks from there and then pick it up via the drive thru. Now that's about as awesome as the Cuba√±a!"}
{"text":"The name says it all.  This family owned restaurant (3 to be exact) specializes in tortas but they also carry your staple Mexican fast-food affair you would find in AZ.  Everything I or anyone else has had has been solid.  Just in case you don't know what a torta is, the best way I can explain what one is that it is essentially a toasted sandwich with a fusion of Mexican and American ingredients.  When it comes to TEG's tortas, there are a few standouts.  One would be the cochinita.  Cochinita which is marinated pork is absolutely delicious by itself, but in a torta, it is absolutely scrumptious!!!  My best description of what cochinita is to think of pulled pork that is braised in a slightly sweet, salty, and spicy redish/orangeish sauce.  In addition, it has American sandwich staples such as mayo, shredded lettuce.  What makes it a \"torta\" are the slices of sweet and sour pickled jalapenos and carrots and slices of avocado (and they do not skimp).  What completes the sandwich, I mean torta, is the bread.  It's always warm and fluffy in the inside and the outside always has a nice crisp texture from the grill.   The other torta I would strongly recommend is the carne asada.  The combination of the carne asada steak with mayo, fresh pico de gallo, and lettuce along with the warm bread makes this torta an absolute winner (my mouth is actually watering just thinking about it!).  The Cubana, which has your typical ingredients that come with any spin on the classic Cuban, is also good.  If you are a big fan of Cubans, then this one may be for you. But in my humble opinion, this does not anywhere near come close to the yummy goodness of the cochinita and carne asada.  The Hawiiana (Hawaiian) is also a relative good choice.  With the combination of Ham and fresh grilled pineapple along with other condiments, it also is descent selection.  As I stated before, they do have staple Arizona style Mexican fast-food here and there are a few I would recommend.  One would be the flautas (large deep fried rolled tacos).  The pollo is the one I would suggest.  If you envision your typical fried rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, well this is not that, this is even better!  The flautas at TEG are larger with much more stuffing then your typical rolled tacos.  In addition, they make them with yummy flour tortillas, not your typical corn.  The shredded chicken is well seasoned and moist.  The tortilla is always fried perfectly, light crisp on the outside with the inside of the tortilla still soft.  The burritos here are good, actually better than average, but because the tortas here are the showcase, everything else takes a backseat.  The rice and beans are hit and miss, especially at the Chandler location.  I used to give TEG four and a half stars, but with the mistake of expanding too quickly, combined with quality and consistency falling a bit, I would have to give them three and half stars; four stars would be stretching. I'm anal so three and three quarter seems to fit.  For example, the Phoenix location, which the Son runs and where he started the chain has a few issues.  For example, the Cochinita at the Phoenix location is always drier and saltier than the other two locations.  In addition, they have certain items only at that location that the other two do not.  One would be their Sonoran style hotdogs, which are excellent and an item I would highly recommend.  When I have gone to both the Mesa and Chandler location and asked for them, and unfortunately they said they don't carry them.  I was disappointed to say the least.   Another example of inconsistency is the last time I went to the Chandler location.  I brought a couple of out of town guests, and I was a little disappointed because the bread was a little too bready (dense) and not light and fluffy as usual.  When all the ingredients are in perfect symphony, you have one amazing torta, but when one ingredient is off such as something like the bread being too dense throws off that harmonious balance of flavors and textures.  In this case, it made a difference from a four and half star sandwich to a 3 star sandwich (which is still good in my book, but not great).  The best and most consistent is their Mesa location.  I think that it is because Mom and Pops run that particular location (well they used to anyways).  Everything has always been consistently delici-oh-so-good.  Overall, would I still recommend Tortas El Guero, and do I still go?  Yes, but I wouldn't rave about the place like I once did especially with the inconsistencies I've experienced as of late.  FYI. Chandler is the only one with a drive-thru."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Tortas I have ever had !  And I have had many. Try the Cubana or the Adobada, both are great. I have made my way around the menu and have never been let down. Great hole in a wall, nothing fancy, just great food."}
{"text":"Best Torta I have ever had!   The place is not much to look at but don't let that stop you from going in.  They are very friendly and the torta's are incredible."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on reviews of fellow Yelpers and while the service is superior, the atmosphere is severely lacking (too cafeteria-like) and the food is good, but not exceptional.   I tried the Cochinita (Sweet & Salty Pork) Torta, my first ever torta. It had a nice taste but the bread didn't seem that fresh to me. I was expecting more."}
{"text":"So I tried this place today and I was extremely impressed!  I'd had tortas before at a couple of the 'bertos places and while they were okay, they were nothing spectacular.  This place was delicious.  Everything on the menu sounded pretty good, but I ended up with the cubana torta and an alambre taco.  While the tacos was very small, it was very good.  The cubana torta was very good as well.  It was humongous!!!  I couldn't even finish the whole thing and I'm a girl that can eat, trust me, I'm from Texas!!!  It was full of meat and it had lots of avocado on it, which I loved.  Let me just warn you about the avocado looking sauce on the salsa bar.  That stuff is hot.  It's good, but it's very, very hot!  Just looking at it, you would think it wold be a mild sauce since it looks like a creamy avocado, but believe me, this is not for people that can't stand the heat!  It took me aback for a second because I seriously wasn't expecting that type of heat.  I still have a bit of sweat on my brow from it right now as I type this review.  Overall, this place is very good and I can't wait to try the quesadillas because they look pretty darn good themselves.  I also have to say the people that work there are very nice and friendly as well.  Bottom line, this place is excellent and I will definitely go back in the near future!"}
{"text":"okay, okay, i admit it!  you got me!  i've been in az for a decade and have NEVER had a torta.  *hangs head in shame*  UNTIL THIS PLACE!  srsly, the asada torta is my new crack.  i am hooked on that shit like a fat kid on cupcakes.  big, gooey, chocolately, covered in sprinkles cupcakes.  you don't need the limes.  you don't need the uber-spicy green shit.  you just need The Torta.  it's soft, moist, got a lil kick and is PACKED with flavor.  honestly, you have to eat it to understand.  i got it two days in a row...that's how good it is.  yeah, now, after writing this, i think it's what i want for dinner.  fuck you, homemade chicken salad.  mama wants torta for dinner."}
{"text":"tommy likey. tommy want taco. SOOOO good. this one is better/cleaner/faster than 16th street. They also give you this kick ass salsa with chips when you eat in. SOOO good.
