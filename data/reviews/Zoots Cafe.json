{"text":"I love everything about the atmosphere and decor, from the checked floor to the strange lamp (with a small boy as a base) on the counter.   I agree with others that it would be lovely to be able to plug in my laptop, but I rarely stay in one place long enough for my battery to drain on me, so it's not a huge deal.   The baked goods are always de-licious and on a recent rainy afternoon I drank the most perfect warming mocha concoction whilst sitting in the front window.  The only thing I don't like (though I do understand) about zoots are the business hours. I often find myself (like right now) wanting to wander out for a lazy coffee in the early evening and most of the time zoots is closed."}
{"text":"what a great place!  we literally chose it because of its proximity to where we were and that it had free wifi, but what a find!  zoots is comfy, serves clafouti pastries and st urbain bagels, and a fabulous range of fairtrade coffees and teas.  the art on the walls and selection of unique classic boardgames position this place to become an instant hit in the neighbourhood. what a treasure!"}
{"text":"Wow what a lovely find on Dundas West! Excellent breakfast, and coffee. I was a little disappointed that they had sold of out baked goods, but the food and promt attentive service made up for that small detail. My partner had a plow man's plate, and I had the \"Paris\" . Both were so good. we will return!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a latte and chill."}
{"text":"I think Zoots may be my new favourite place to hang out and get some work done.   First of all, the decor is stunning. It's got that old timey, stonehouse feel with just the right about of charming knick knacks to make you feel like you might be in someone's apartment cafe. The tables are long and made of this beautiful stained wood, with uniform highback black chairs. There is a counter by both front windows (to each side of the entrance) with barstools where I saw half a dozen people perched with their laptops (free wi-fi!). Then there are two more barstools at the cafe counter which were empty during my visit but I imagine would be popular places to sit if you want to chat up the staff.   Zoots' menu was really impressive for such a small place - they had some chicken sandwich that looked intriguing, plus a carrot & ginger soup and a handful of baked goods courtesy of Clafouti (which seems to be unanimously adored by everyone in the city). I had a raspberry croissant and it was ridiculous. Incredibly soft and fresh even at 3pm, after the cafe had been open for 8 hours.   I also had an organic Earl Grey tea that was steeped up from loose leaves. There was quite a selection of organic tea and I didn't even get a chance to glance at the coffee list as I'm not a coffee drinker but I assure you it's vast.   Shame about the business hours though - 7pm closing time every night? How about a compromise so I can stay till after dark...10pm?"}
