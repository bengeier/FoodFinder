{"text":"Came to Oakville to meet up with a friend and we came to this restaurant, and I have to say I was disappointed. Ordered the crispy beef for myself, and the dish had about 7 pieces of beef and the other 90% of the dish was vegetables. The portion size itself is already small and there was not enough beef in a dish that focuses on mainly beef. It was definitely overpriced, and compared to asian restaurants in Toronto, I've had much better crispy beefs that were cheaper and better portioned."}
{"text":"Similar to what you'd cook at home. Fresh chunky vegetables and almost no MSG which is very hard to come by for Asian restuarnts in toronto area.

Items on the menus are hit and miss though. I love their Mapo tofu, but the slowed cooked curry beef was more of WTF? Just like home cooked meal. Some are freaking awesome but some are just plain bad. Still one of the freshest and cleanest asian food in GTA and for that reason alone, it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is my go-to when I want to go out to eat in Oakville and not eat at a typical chain restaurant. So many delicious dishes, the family who owns the place is both friendly and efficient, and I love their dessert squares. I've never ordered take out from here, but every time i've gone in for lunch or dinner I've really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great food and owners are great people. Crispy beef is my favorite. Wonton soup good as well"}
{"text":"Chicken adobo tasted really great but quantity should have been more considering the price. The peppers were cut pretty large- julienne should have been ideal"}
{"text":"Very warm, clean atmosphere. Mimi was very welcoming and friendly, and the food was delicious. We shared the fresh dumplings (ask specifically as they run out), peanut broccoli, green beans with pork, ginger beef, and chicken kung pow. Both the ginger beef and the kung pow were a little spicier than I am used to, but it really added to the taste, and these two were probably my favourite dishes.  I also loved the brown garlic butter rice."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to this restaurant for years! The owners are  friendly and accommodating and the food is fresh, carefully prepared, and consistently delicious. Highly recommended when you are craving Asian food!"}
{"text":"I took my friend there  just this friday.  We ordered noodles , binagoongan rice adobo,wonton dumplings and beef. I noticed that the beef was full of onions and i asked our server and the manager said its always been like that but the onions was almost full plate. So i did not complain anymore. As we were paying and there was food to go , the manager lady asked if i want to take home the onions !! How rude!! That is very insulting! I will never go back to his p,ace!!"}
{"text":"We come here as a family a lot. Great food and the owners are great people. Calamari is great and they make a regular dish like fried rice into something fantastic. 

Also really great dishes like cha behoon that is hard to find and very regional. 

One of our favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"Love this little spot! It came highly recommend, so I thought I would give it a try. I went with my mom one evening, a little too close to closing. The staff were extremely welcoming. They remembered my mom from another visit and it has even been awhile since she had eaten there. 

We started with the Celadon Wontons. Delicious! Love the homemade sweet and sour sauce they come with. 

I ordered the coconut chicken with jasmine rice. It was so good! You could really taste the lemon grass   It was sweet, but with a hint of heat from the curry. I would definitely order this dish again. 

My mom got the pad thai with chicken. She loved it! The portion was huge. We took the rest home for lunch the next day. It had just the right amount of heat and wasn't sweet like so many other places make it. It was delicious! 

The prices are decent. Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Food was cold and also very small portion for the price.  There was barely any crispy beef and I was still hungry."}
{"text":"The house noodles were flavourful and the portion was robust. Quick, friendly service and reasonable prices. Asian comfort food at its best in the west end! We will surely return for more!"}
{"text":"I ordered basil chicken, coconut beef curry & Tom Yum soup for take out.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement, I will never eat here again. If there was an option for no stars I would have chosen that. Nothing I ordered reflected the description on the menu (pics included). If your in the mood for Asian food the mall food court has more appealing food then Celadon."}
{"text":"We live in the area and this us our go to place when we want a good dinner but can't or don't want to cook. Everything is delicious and the staff friendly. You won't be disapointed."}
{"text":"Food is acceptable, customer service could be much better.  Felt being rushed entire time we were in."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my son.
Quick service and great food, very tasty and totally affordable. Place is busy at lunch"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good place their pad Thai lunch is good and the crispy ginger beef is really good. It's a family run business that seems to do quite well. They are a little on the pricy side but it is located in Oakville. Otherwise I would definitely recommend the place!!"}
{"text":"This has got to be my #1 Thai spot, and possibly my favourite restaurant of all time. Great for dine in or take out. The family running it is beyond friendly and courteous and DAMN.. They make good food.

The chicken and broccoli is a go to, with the most perfectly cooked broccoli you will ever come across, but the star of the show has to be the spicy coconut beef curry. Slow cooked for hours this beef practically melts in your mouth. The spice ranges, but it's always a welcome burn.

I've been here probably 50+ times and I plan to keep that going. Keep up the incredible work!"}
{"text":"Food is so bad that I threw it away!  They screwed my order and I called to correct it.  They said I'm the one that told them the wrong item.  Poor customer service.  Never going there again!"}
