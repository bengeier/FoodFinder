{"text":"Good fresh food at a very reasonable price.  They have the most wonderful burgers and fries.  They usually feature some type of chinese food.  Fried chicken and mashed potatoes are a staple here.  Good desserts, especially the cheesecake.  
The people are always friendly despite the fact that they deal with a high volume of people and not everyone is nice.  
I always get something from here before I leave the casino."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here. I always get the spring rolls. They are really cheap,  2 for like 80 cents. Not the best tasting but for the price you can't complain. This location isn't bad for desserts either. This place is 5 stars if you're drinking and gambling for sure.  It's in Casino Arizona so the drinks are free (soda, water,  ect). I'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"I needed some food to soak up the alcohol that I consumed at a music concert (show) that I attended at the casino.

I ended up ordering a cheeseburger. If you don't expect much then you won't be disappointed by this place. I really hate when restaurants take a burger off the grill and slap on a cold piece of american cheese and the bun. I'm sure there's an alternative universe out there that makes the cooks eat their burgers like that. But until I get there this place will be a two star restaurant. The other restaurant venues at  Casino Arizona are much better than this place."}
