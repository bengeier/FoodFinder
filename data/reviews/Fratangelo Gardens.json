{"text":"Great store/deli...Great place to stop for lunch, their Italian hoagies and fish sandwiches are amazing. Really fresh Italian meats and cheeses...it's nice to see a old fashioned place doing well. A regular stop for us."}
{"text":"We have had a great deal of work done by Bennett and his team. They landscaped our yard and did a huge wall in the back yard. It was 80 feet wide and he had to fix a wall that was failing. They did a fantastic job in a timely manner and all his employees were friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Great little Italian store, excellent cheese selection, great deli, and their fish sandwiches are oh soooo good."}
{"text":"There's a lot here, olive oil, pasta, cheeses, sauces, chocolates...just everything you would expect of an authentic Italian Deli. There are prepared sandwiches and pizza, with a small dining area. 

Prices are very reasonable and the selection is quite impressive. 

The staff is welcoming and friendly, I enjoy simply browsing sometimes

I wasn't expecting to find this gem in the suburbs, it's rather unique."}
{"text":"The food is great, the store is great. However, on two occasions when I have ordered a meatball hoagie, the deli had a fit. Not to mention, when they went back into the kitchen, I heard a few f-bombs being dropped. This place deserves 5 stars, but they won't get it from me until they hone better manners."}
{"text":"Best fish sandwich ever!! 
Small italian store with a good selection of cheese and also a deli. 
But like my first statement said their fish sandwiches are the best, the reason I even found out about this place existing. 

One thing for sure they need more room for parking, Fridays during lent this place gets crowded, no room to park so be prepared to wait.

Definitely worth a try :)"}
