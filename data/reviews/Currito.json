{"text":"Good gluten free option. Similar to Chipotle. I had the Classic bowl and side of chips. Good for airport food! I would definitely go aga"}
{"text":"Nice options for breakfast before you catch your flight. Burritos can be sloppy - try either the breakfast quesadillas or the town (best). Can be a little slow due to fewer staff in the morning - make sure to leave extra time."}
{"text":"I love that there is a tofu option which tastes great. Plus the regular burrito options are all fantastic and healthy. Tastes great , quick , and fast service."}
{"text":"Gives chipotle a run for their money, however I wish I would've tried a more exotic burrito option. Traditional burrito was tasty with a spectacularly tight wrap. You didn't need a fork or knife for the job of taking it down."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but enjoy tofu, so figured I'd get a tofu burrito bowl as a quick pre-flight meal. I like what Chipotle does with their tofu- they braise it and flavor it. Yum. The tofu at this place is terrible- it is raw and unflavored. Like, as if you went to the grocery store, bought a block of tofu, cut it in slices, and ate it. This place gives tofu a bad name."}
{"text":"Nothing outstanding about the place. 

It's just a regular fast-food chain that serves Chipotle-style burritos. 

Unlike other major burrito joints, which gives you no flavoring / style options,  you have 6 or 7 choices to choose from.  I tried the cajun and thought it was pretty decent.

The best thing about the restaurants in this airport is that they don't really have huge mark ups. A small burrito will run you about 6 dollars and a regular for 7 dollars."}
{"text":"AMAZING. I was surprised considering it was just at the airport but seriously, I got the Burrito with tofu and the Bangkok one and brown rice instead. It was amazing and huge too! Not expensive. I never write reviews but I had to write for this one (maybe I was just super hungry? Not sure but it was amazing!)."}
{"text":"Airport food is usually unappetizing, bland, and somewhat scary.  However, Currito was a fresh alternative to greasy heavy food.  When you are about to board a flight where you will be packed in like sardines with complete strangers, you want to not create anymore discomfort than needed.  

This is not your normal run-of-the-mill Chipotle, Moe's, or Qdoba style burrito bar.  For instance, I had the delicious Bangkok Burrito filled with a fresh slaw (made of cilantro, cabbage, and carrots), topped with organic tofu, white rice, spicy peanut sauce, and cucumbers.  The meal was light and only $5.50.  Hallah!  City of Squallah!

I hope they open a location in Florida sometime in the future, because I still want to try the Mediterranean and the Teriyaki Burritos."}
{"text":"while the food is great, the service is horrible. at least in the evenings. one employee in particular trash talked people waiting in line for food, threw ingredients together sloppily and slammed food/containers on the countertop, all the while rolling her eyes and sighing loudly. this made myself and everyone else in line feel like a huge inconvenience. will not be returning on the days i see her on shift, as this isn't the first time with her attitude."}
{"text":"This was actually a GREAT burrito. And it was bought at the airport! My husband brought some of these home last night on his way back from a business trip. He got me a Mediterranean burrito, which came with black bean hummus, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta, and balsamic dressing on a whole wheat tortilla. Of course, you can add whatever meat you want. My burrito had brown rice, which tasted great and made it seem somewhat healthy too, coupled with the wheat tortilla.

I looked them up online, and they seem to have a bunch of unconventional options with ingredients from a variety of cuisines (for example, they have one called the \"Bangkok\" which has asian slaw and thai-style peanut sauce inside). Other than this ridiculous airport location, they have another location at Beachwood  Place. And one in Cincinatti, but who cares about that...hehe! Just kidding.

I dread going to the airport because I know I'll usually have to eat there. But I would definitely go back to Currito. Although I didn't try the \"original\" traditional burrito, I would guess that it rivals Chipotle for sure--and is probably way less salty."}
{"text":"Wow, would've never thought that noodles, rice, Asian veggies, and teriyaki would work in a burrito but their Teriyaki burrito is pretty amazing. Added tofu and a side of sriracha it was even better. 

Looks like other's experience with this place has been hit or miss but I had a great first experience with this burrito. Good to have a healthy vegan / veggie option which is not all that common in an airport."}
{"text":"I wondered what the average review would be before I checked this place on Yelp. I had already eaten my breakfast burrito and was thoroughly underwhelmed. 

So, the 3 star average that I saw is exactly what I was thinking I would rate this place. The staff was a little disorganized and confused, and the food while ok, was nothing that I would ever seek out again. 

So, 3 stars it is. If I were you I'd go next door to Chick Fila... That's what I should've done."}
{"text":"I was really craving Mexican when arriving at the airport, so I bee lined it to churrito, conveniently located close to every security entrance. I've had their standard burrito before so I thought I would change it up: Bangkok burrito bowl, please!  Not quite Mexican, it comes with Asian slaw, peanut sauce, cucumbers and rice. It's got a kick, but that's about all it has - plus, it's definitely not a peanut sauce, a lot more similar to teriyaki. 

When I come back (because, let's be honest, I'm always down for a burrito) I'll stick to the classic, summer, or anything but the Bangkok."}
{"text":"I mean I know it's the airport but if you have had any good Mexican food before, this superbly pales in comparison. There is absolutely no taste to go with the fancy menu items. I must say though that the food seemed fresh."}
{"text":"Like many travelers, I sometimes regret not having the forethought to buy a sandwich from a neighborhood eatery on the way to the airport and being faced with an unloved, overpriced airport meal.
  
Currito is similar to Chipotle in style and execution.  Unlike Chipotle, I don't know where they source their meat from, they don't mention it, but that's typical of most restaurants today.

I had a delicious and filling burrito with tofu.  For a very fair $7.99, It was a satisfying and healthy meal.  Both employees were courteous & friendly, I really appreciate it."}
{"text":"The food tasted alright. It was like a copy of Chipotle. I will tell you though, the one thing that I really did like was the mango chutney! Yum! The rest was MEH!"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's airport food, but I really like this place!  Imagine Chipoltle, but the burrito choices are the flavors of different countries. Indian, Thai, Mediterranean, and (of course) classic Mexican. My favorite is the Indian Tikka Masala chicken burrito with spicy chickpeas and cucumber cream sauce. Why would you eat a nasty airport burger when there are choices like this?"}
{"text":"Wonderful for vegetarians! This was the best bowl I've ever had. I created my own bowl with tofu, brown rice, black beans, corn salsa, two other salsas, guacamole, cabbage, green onions, spinach, and mixed greens. The chips were not oily, and the salsa was great. I wish we had this place in Texas."}
{"text":"For airport food, this place serves relatively healthy, okay-tasting food that actually has a number of choices for a vegan. However, this place is a far cry from the likes of Chipotle, Qdoba, or Moe's.

I ordered a small strawberry banana smoothie made with soy milk for $4.96. The classic tofu burrito bowl I ordered came out to be $7.99 plus $1.79 for guacamole. For the dollop of guac I got, this pricing was kind of ridiculous. (It looks like I got more guac than I'm describing from the pic, but rest assured it's because the lid squished it down.) The corn also tasted plasticky, like it came straight from a can. Trying to get the employee to give me extra of anything in my burrito bowl was a hopeless tug of war where I was on the losing side. 

If I was in the Cleveland airport, I would eat here again but not very enthusiastically.

2.5 stars"}
{"text":"I honestly was hoping Currito would be curry-burritos.  Imagine how good that would be?  A wrap with curry and rices; could have korma, saag, mutter?  That would be a collision worthy of fireworks...

Be that as it may, it is decent mexican for an airport, but I daresay I prefer eating in the southwest...  But perhaps that was asking for a bit much.

2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty burritos with lots of vegetarian and vegan options. The Buffalo and Bangkok burritos are the best.  Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Is it weird that I get a little giddy every time I head to the airport from the anticipation of eating at Currito? Yupp that sounds pretty strange, but hey it's the truth! Currito is seriously the best food place at the airport! I've tried both the teriyaki chicken and chicken masala burritos, and both were BOMB! The service is also really fast. So if you're stuck at the airport for a while and those unexpected munchies come in, stop by Currito and treat your taste buds to something delicious :)"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!   What a great experience.   The food was great and the employees made a stressful travel day just go away.   The food was amazing, convenient, and affordable.   I highly recommend this world class establishment.   Thanks for the great service and food!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Currito on my way to Philadelphia. It is a small take out station in one of the Airport food court areas. In terms of other familiar restaurants you might know, it is most comparable to the Boloco chain in Boston, with various Asian fusion style of burritos being their main product.

This particular location is, naturally, well located, and had pleasant staff who were efficient. Notably, they tried to upsell me about three times, which I found super annoying; this practice that chains follow, while increasing revenue, wastes my time and makes the interaction, when I've already spent time thinking about my entree, take a lot more time.

The food itself was great. It's simple fare: rice with vegetables and a protein along with a house sauce in either a bowl or burrito. It's hard to mess up this format if you have fresh ingredients, which they did. 

My main criticism, which I have about most airport food, is the cost. $9 for this kind of food is pretty ridiculous. It's not sushi, and it's made on an assembly line."}
{"text":"Waiting for my flight and thought I'd grab a burrito bowl. 

Not good. 

I got the Thai bowl with chicken and it left a lot to be desired. The amount of food was marginal. The toppings were sparse. The sauce lacked flavor. Felt like a bad rice bowl, not a \"burrito without borders.\"

Overall, I would try a different establishment in the airport."}
{"text":"As far as airport fare, this is top shelf stuff.  Its not anyway near chipolte or even Moe's but this is in an airport and choices are few.  Nice choice of add ons, so we are building our own.  I opted for bowl over tortilla wrap (50 cents more).  The beef is steak (ground beef not option), it was fairly well cooked and not dried out.  The mango salsa is nice touch, little bite to it!. If you want to take it on plane, have them put sour cream on before cheese (much cleaner when you open it later). All together two meals with a shared bottle of pop was $18."}
{"text":"Horrible service for a \"build your own\" restaurant. I ordered a tofu burrito on wheat tortilla with black beans. The server did not drain the beans and I only got two slices of tofu. I paid $1.29 extra for guacamole and when it was applied as the final ingredient, it was a small ice cream scoop plopped in the middle. She immediately rolled it up and put it on the panini grill (their signature). I asked for more guacamole and the other server made it in a cup. I was then told that I owed an additional $1.29. I explained that I had already paid and she said \"we got portions here.\" So I got a refund and the entire burrito went into the trash.

Their loss!"}
{"text":"I was waiting for my flight to take off, and was a little hungry. I always  stop at Panini's when I come to airport. But today, I wanted something different. So I decided to get a Chicken Quesadilla to spice it up.

I got it with chicken, carmelized onions, and cheese. It came with 2 salsas and I got a sour cream.-- Made it a combo for like $2.49 and got chips and a drink.

The employees were very nice and helpful. It's kind of like Chipotle, but different. It was a little pricy I thought, but everything at the airport is, am I right??"}
{"text":"Possibly one of the worst burritos I have ever had. 90% rice. I know it's the airport, but almost  $10 for a burrito is obscene enough, and having it be mostly rice makes it downright insulting. If I weren't starving, and curious to see if, as I got closer to the end, there were more meat, salsa, guacamole....anything, I would have taken it back. My mistake. One day I will learn that most Clevelanders have the pallets of an 8 year old and that I should lower my cosmopolitan standards."}
{"text":"This place gets one extra star because it's something different than the usual fast food trash. But that's it. Given the proliferation of \"fresh\" burrito places, including in airports, this place is an embarrassment. My burrito bowl was bland, watery, and not warm. Next time I have a layover at Hopkins, maybe I will just stick to the usual fast food trash."}
{"text":"Purchased a breakfast bowl and it was awful.  Potatoes, beans, and chorizo must have been left over from the day before.  EVERYTHING was cold.  It didn't even seem like it was reheated and just left sitting there and it got cold.  Seemed like it was taken out of the refrigerator and left at room temperature.  I asked for hot salsa and she gave me mild."}
{"text":"A long agonizing flight delay kicked my hunger into desperation mode, where I eventually found myself waiting in line for Currito, a popular midwest burrito chain previously known as The Wrap in several states. My expectations were extremely low but even then that was too much. The experience was beyond disappointing, so much so that I actually was turned off by the thought of additional Mexican food (#1).

It should be said I tend to expect less of all airport establishments. Even McDonalds isn't the same animal when past an airport security gate. I really have nothing against the idea of Currito, which as a Chipotle lover, should mean I'm very open to fast food burritos. I do however suffer from a bit of confusion on it's name, which in Spanish means \"worker man\" or carries the sentiment of a \"blue collar\" laborer. Am I really eating a blue collar burrito?

The ladies behind the counter were slow to make my Cajun Chicken (black beans, salsa, corn, rice, sour cream and some Cajun seasoning) and my friend's Buffalo Chicken (bleu cheese, buffalo sauce, celery), both of which turned out soggy and extremely unstable. Things got so bad they ended up serving my burrito on a plastic container lid instead of a plate. No napkins were given and no additional sauces were available. 

Worst of all, both burritos were beyond mediocre. I made a squeamish face with every bite into the burrito, the ingredients were neither fresh nor tasty, a deadly combo that will result in a buzzkill for any burrito lover. The after taste of the Cajun seasoning left a bad film in the mouth, that not even another (tasty) burrito could fix. Even $10 at the nearby Burger King would've been a better investment than this.

If these are Burritos without Borders, then keep me in the country.
_______
(#1) Hell froze over this day."}
{"text":"I love the Mediterranean burrito!!  The ingredients are diverse and very fresh. I love that they grill the burrito a little at the end to crisp up the tortilla. I just wish that the foul wasn't so super thin and weak - my foil came off in shreds. Friendly service. I also tried the Nutella wrap and that was delicious. The burritos are very filling, so the Nutella wrap is great as a shareable treat."}
{"text":"Bad day at Curritio? Maybe. More likely just another day. I ordered a Classic Steak Bowl. Dried out meat. Sprinkle of beans. About 2 servings worth of rice. Brown guac. Weird corn. All in my burrito bowl. Had to clarify the order with the clerk, but once he got it right on the register it was already built without my input on the line. I guess that's somehow my fault for not doing a build your own. Alas, it could have been a good alternative to hamburgers or pizza in the airport. But it's NOT Chipolte. Too bad."}
{"text":"Great burrito! Better than the big name place people drag me to. This burrito had a fresher taste for sure."}
{"text":"Waiting for my flight I was looking for something to eat I was enticed by the exotic burritos. I ordered the chicken Tika burrito. The curried chick peas were really good. There mix of toppings also were great the only flaw and it's not insignificant, the rice. So obviously instant, mushy no texture. Rice is so easy to make why do restaurants take this shortcut? Never a good idea. If they changed that it would be much better."}
{"text":"Decent asian fusion burrito and not super expensive, which surprised me in the airport. I would say the bangkok was a good choice, even though the sauce was kind of salty and the tortilla was kind of dry as well. Too much sauce, too."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my salad. It's nice to have a healthy, tasty, not crazy expensive option at the airport."}
{"text":"I got the tikka burrito with a side of guacamole and chips. It was pretty good, but the burrito was rather \"ricey\" if they just put a little more sauce and cucumber it may have made it more flavorful. The chips and guacamole aren't chipotle good, but they did it for me."}
{"text":"In a rush to catch my flight I wondered if I would be able to secure a decent vegetarian meal in the airport.

Believe it or not, by the time I finished my meal I was actually thankful I had no time to stop elsewhere.  Service was quick and very pleasant, and the flavors were perfectly blended.

If all airport food were like this, travelers would be much happier, and less disgruntled.  Nothing worse than being  hungry, in a rush, waiting in line to pay a fortune for mediocre airport food. . . 

Such a pleasure to have a different experience. Thank you so much Currito for the delightful departure from sucky airport food!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am flying out of CLE, I have made it a point that I HAVE to eat here.  It has become a ritual. Food at airports doesn't get better than this. Absolutely brilliant. Being a vegetarian, their options are immense. The organic tofu in a burrito is a great ingredient to offer. Availability of brown rice makes the food healthier! And great staff too, I have been treated courteously every time."}
{"text":"Awesome airport food exists! Great service and attention to details. They even say \"Thank You\". I've had the Bangkok and the Teriyaki burrito.  Both were hot and well made with fresh tasting vegetables. If you're anywhere in the airport and hungry, this is your place. Plenty of food for the money."}
{"text":"This is about as good as airport food can be on a Sunday afternoon.  I got the chicken quesadilla with added guacamole.  The portion is very generous as were the sides of included salsa and sour cream.  The quesadilla was made to order and would be enough for two to share.  Other than a bit too much grilled onions, it was really good."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch after passing through the TSA Pre security checkpoint.

I ordered a Chicken Burrito Bowl - with lettuce, cheese, spicy salsa, pico de gallo, grilled onions, scallions, and corn salsa - no beans or rice - basically a low carb lunch - and a bottle of water.

The build your bowl setup is very similar to Chipotle. Except that Currito's offers some additional ingredients that you can't get a Chipotle - such as Mango salsa. I wanted to add Guacamole to my bowl, but they were out of it.

It was a very average lunch - kind of bland, but filling and about as healthy as one is going to find in an Airport."}
{"text":"No idea what Nick R. Is talking about but from his review, he talks way too much. Our experience was met with smiles, great suggestions on how to build our burrito bowl. Fast service and fresh tasting food satisfied our entire family of five. We only had 20 min and they proved to be the right spot for our dinner. We looked at others who reached the food area with us still waiting at other restaurants after we were served."}
{"text":"Asked the dude working here what was the best burrito.  He said the Cajun Chicken Burrito so I took the dive and was thoroughly pleased! It's loaded with black beans and rice with chicken, lettuce and some tomatoes (and a few forgotten condiments).  With the weight of it you sure can tell it's loaded!  A great inexpensive meal that would be easy to eat on a flight also!  With drink it was just around $10.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"For airport food this was higher quality and offered the only healthy option in the area. None of the other restaurants in this section of the airport offer foods that provide any nutrients so I'm glad Curritio exists. 

This is a customizable meal option with a wide variety of options. From a distance it looked like a Mexican restaurant, but the menu offers bowls in general that are not necessarily just Mexican food ingredients. I liked that they offered a bowl with Indian food flavors and a create your own option. There are also smoothies and other healthy options.

I went with a Mexican themed bowl and found it to be a generous portion at a reasonable price. The ingredients tasted fresh and the flavors were great. I'll definitely return to this spot on future Cleveland trips."}
{"text":"With a quick layover in CLE after being rerouted due to the Nor'easter, I was ready to spend that time searching for a quick bite to eat. The food court area had lots of typical fast food options but Currito was the one that caught my eye.

Now, I'm guessing the name of this place is a fusion of curry and burrito which I am all about. Here we have essentially a Chipotle but with more varied ingredients and different price points depending on whether you're getting a small or medium burrito, or a bowl.

After a quick scan of the menu, I went with the Bangkok which comes with \"Asian\" slaw, cilantro lime rice, cucumber, and peanut sauce. I added steak as my protein of choice. Truthfully, I was enticed by the peanut sauce being inside this burrito and it was definitely needed. You watch them craft your burrito in front of you and hope that they are able to wrap the gigantic bundle into place.

Surprisingly my burrito was quite tasty. The rice was nicely cooked and the steak was well seasoned for being fast food. I wish they had drizzled a bit more peanut sauce though so I'd definitely recommend asking for more if you enjoy the sauce. Mine tasted a bit plain without.

Currito is a quick and easy stop when you're at the airport and will certainly offer the most variety out of the other spots in the food court. Cards accepted and service is quick so you can make sure to catch your flight."}
{"text":"Forgot to finish this review from 5 months ago. Stopped off at this place for a connecting flight and it looked promising. Everyone was helpful and courteous but the food was simple bland. Not much else to say, I ended up getting more sauce to give it some flavor. I had a chicken burrito with pretty much everything on it."}
{"text":"Whenever I am hungry, and at the CLE airport I bee line it to Currito. I like both their burritos and the option to put it in a bowl for those who wish to do so. It's basically you order from the menu, pay, and watch the assembly line prepare your order. I usually get the thai option with tofu. The veggies are fresh, and my meal is assembled quickly. They have a variety of sauces as well, including sriracha, my fave. The food is filling, and quick. For vegans like myself you can easily find something tasty here. With all the food choices in airports these days this is a welcome, fast place to get a tasty meal quickly."}
{"text":"Not bad for a fast casual tex mex place at the airport. I ordered the burrito house salad which had romaine lettuce, grilled chicken, pico de gallo, corn salsa, black beans, feta cheese, scallions, and creamy lime dressing. From the time I ordered, it only took about 6 or 7 minutes to receive my salad. All the ingredients seemed fresh and it was tasty. They put the sauce on the side which I appreciate. And it wasn't as salty as Chipotle. I would give this place 3.5 stars if I had the option. The also have smoothie options. Definitely a solid option at the Cleveland Airport."}
{"text":"Located in the food court between concourses B & C. Quick service. I like the burrito bowls. 

Perfect pit-stop for refueling before take off."}

To Whom It May Concern: 

Today I visited Currito for the first time while on a layover at the Cleveland International Airport and must say that the experience was not something to \"feel good about\". The staff was not courteous and handled the food preparation line like a military (or prison) mess hall. My classic chicken burrito bowl was slapped together without eye contact to the customer. I would rather the food have been prepared behind an iron curtain than be treated like an animal at feeding time. 

This was probably ALL my fault because I assumed since the store looked like Chipotle, I might have a say in my order but I was sternly reminded that I didn't get the \"make your own\" burrito... and oh yeah the \"did you want / expect for me to remake that order?\" attitude set me over the edge. 

In the end, I spent $10.78 for a sloppy burrito bowl with watery sour cream sprayed all over with a tiny scoop of guac and a tortilla on the side (ps... that was an additional $0.79 **explained by server while rolling eyes**). 

Honestly, I would rather dine at Chipotle and get food + ecoli poisoning than receive this type of \"burrito experience\". I guess all that glitters is not gold. 

I apologize for wasting your time and inconveniencing your employees at the CLE currito stand, wish you guys the best of luck.


Yours truly,
Disenchanted customer"}
{"text":"The person behind the counter was super nice, super patient with the morons who were in front of me, and totally helpful.  Its too bad the food was so tasteless.  All the stars here are for the service - the food was two stars at best."}
{"text":"About the only moderately healthy option in the Cleveland Airport.  More options than chipotle, but the ingredients are a little less fresh."}
{"text":"Currito is quick, fast, and provides lots of healthy, vegetarian options.

I got the Mediterranean Bowl with tofu and a Mango smoothie. The Mediterranean Bowl was delicious and the portion size was comfortably above average. The mango smoothie was alright, but it definitely tasted like they did not use ripe or fresh mangos in it. I also felt as if it was too sweet."}
{"text":"Staff is unapologetically rude.  My preparer, through my food together like slop, and was annoyed when I inquired to add extra toppings.  I didn't care if I had to pay extra, but it was too much of a chore for your staff this evening to explain.  I will not trouble them again as I will NEVER again patronize this establishment!"}
{"text":"I gotta hand it to them on creativity. The burritos are sort of \"around the world\" themed AND they have a small size, which is nice. I couldn't resist trying the Tikka with chicken, which sounded great, but the execution was a little lackluster. I thought the tikka masala sauce would be rich and tomatoey and spicy but it was too mild. :/ The burrito also had cilantro lime rice, chickpeas (which I liked a lot), cucumbers (a nice crunch) and a yogurt sauce. Perhaps the yogurt sauce neutralized the other sauce too much. Either way, a burrito called Tikka needs to be spicy and spicy, it was not. I would be open to trying a different one if I should find myself at one of these again, but I won't be expecting a world of flavor."}
{"text":"It's just like Restaurant Stakeout.

So as we approached Curritos, I was excited. A burrito store with crazy fillings like buffalo, tikka masala, and Mediterranean?  Sounds amazing, let me at it!  Now, I know that airport employees are more or less on good terms with each other, since, hey, when the worst of humanity comes out, say during a snowstorm or tornado, all you have is each other.  I'm cool with that bond. 

The bond was in full swing as we approached, Olivia and her countermate making chatter with some other airport employees. As we came up, the man at the register tried to pay attention to us as we ordered, but kept joining the conversation, at one point telling Olivia, 'hurry up with that bowl, they're almost back'. We finished ordering at a somewhat glacial pace, and Olivia continued to make what appeared to be a small sculpture of worldly burrito ingredients. 

And then we waited. It was only maybe a minute or five, long enough to realize that the ordering process was backward from say Chipotle, where you build it then pay, not pay then build. Needless to say there are some interesting ingredients to look at over there.  Sometime between waiting to order at Starbucks and the time it takes to stroll the MET in New York, Olivia finally turned over the equivalent of the Statue of Liberty bowl, and was ready to work on mine.   Similarly to miss liberty, I don't believe any money exchanged hands either. 

Her counterpart had already called her out on being slow, and proceeded to build my buffalo chicklet of a bowl. Once he finished, my poor little buffalo chicken bowl would have been trounced by the gargantuan beast that I saw leave, but after I tasted it I'm not sure I regretted it.  The overwhelming flavor was that of franks red hot. The blue cheese component was marginalized in a slaw that contained very little creaminess or flavor. Not that unctuous richness that so associable with buffalo chicken.  

My girlfriend was left waiting longer for her chicken quesadilla. So long in fact two other employees turned up. The flavor in the quesadilla was similarly lacking. Although it had a good mix of onions and corn, it lacked the richness of a good amount of cheese, and the large chunks of chicken were unforgiving to the structural integrity of the flour tortilla. Overall, forgettable, and certainly not curious. 

Curritos should count itself lucky it exists in an airport, since without a captive audience this sort of service would be the kiss of death. The concept is fun, but better management and a reevaluation of the concept might be in order. And hey, if the staff were nearly as friendly to the customers as they are to their co-workers, I'd be back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Even though they had rice ready to go on the line, they would not simply add a scoop to my breakfast burrito, even for an extra charge."}
{"text":"I tried the Tikka! Indian-inspired flavors and a tofu option. Likin' it! I think the only thing that would make it better is a wheat flatbread tortilla instead of plain flour. Cashier was nice. Solid!"}
{"text":"Missed breakfast at the few sit down restaurants in the airport and I wasn't wanting a bagel or a bunch of meat. I decided to try this place out after checking out their menu. I got s Bangkok burrito with tofu. You can substitute brown rice and add hot sauce. Great veggie option which could be put in a bowl. People behind me were making very creative bowls. The choice of fillings is very ethnically diverse. Staff was friendly and prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Very understaffed. Long lines. Slow production. Staff was nice but overwhelmed. Food was fair, Chicken Burrito Bowl."}
{"text":"For fast food at the airport, this is great. Lots of healthy options, fast and friendly service. Love it. I eat here most times I'm at the airport at mealtime."}
{"text":"Total ripoff. For $7.50 (I got breakfast quesadilla + bacon), I got four tiny pieces of quesadilla bread with a bit of egg in between and TWO! (For extr 1.50) pieces of bacon. I was the only costumer waiting and had to wait for over two minutes until 3 workers prepared a single meal before mine. Not worth the wait or the end product. If necessary to eat build your own bowl and just ask them to add stuff. They are very likely to try to cut down on ingredients but you can always demand extra."}
{"text":"Worse breakfast burrito in history - tasted like medicine - i never give bad reviews but cant hold this one - the places honors the term \"crappy airport food\""}
{"text":"So what a surprise...large portions of good food at a decent price. It isn't just quesadillas that are served here (which is what I had) but there was a Thai Peanut Burrito that you could order with chicken or steak. I was tempted to try something else but was skeptical of airport food. It was really good. I don't know if there are other locations outside of the airport, but if I came across one again, I would definitely pop in. Oh...and the service here was really friendly AND efficient. I dug it."}
