{"text":"Cool sports bar.  Don't come here looking for good food or service. Ordered two drinks and the server let another person in my party add to the tab. Okay then, but she never brought back change and tipped herself 50% of the tab. Way not cool. Watch your wallet when coming here."}
{"text":"Nasty ass food! I finally tried it. Shitty service and not very nice service. They think they are \"Godlike\" there."}
{"text":"Dos Mas is more of a sports bar that has off track betting than a restaurant. The food is more or less sub par bar food. Staff was friendly however. I would not recommend for dining."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Dos Mas. Sat at the bar. Watched a football game, and played around betting on the ponies. Definitely more of a sports bar atmosphere. Margaritas were good and strong, beer was cold. Service was good. We had the Mexican pizza, and fish tacos. Fish tacos had a tasty chipolte sauce, and filled with a generous portion of crispy battered fish. Mexican pizza was huge for $6. Is it the best Mexican food around? Not by any means...more like bar food. We figured that going in.  However, overall it was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Horrible food! Beer wasn't cold. Don't go!!!! Wish I had read the reviews before going."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Had to advise someone we had been waiting for 10 min for menus and a server. Once server came over asked if we were ready to order even though we didn't have any menus. Waited 40 mins for food that seemed from a can and microwaved. Told slow due to only one cook working. Once food came out we had to go find our own silverware and napkins.  Never asked if we needed drink refills. Very bad service, food not so great more like bar food - not returning here."}
{"text":"DO NOT EVEN BOTHER ... Food came out cold and the beans seem like they came straight out of the can. Service is absolutely horrible. Oh and to top it off we had to ask for chips and salsa. Let's me be honest who has to ask for that at a Mexican restaurant. At 7pm on a Friday night in a restaurant with 20 tables there are only 2 tables occupied. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"We were hoping to spend the evening with some good food and spirits.  We ended up with some of the worst dinners and drinks you could ever ask for.  This claimed to be a \"Mexican Grill\", but we were served salsa that must have come from a can.  My wife and I only had a couple of tastes before pushing it aside.   Our margaritas were extremely strong with an over abundance of tequila to the point that it was all that you tasted.  Our plates showed up with dry and tasteless meat and liquefied beans.  Needless to say we were still hungry when we left.

If I could have rated zero stars I would have.  Very disappointing evening."}
{"text":"One star for the beans, one for the very pleasant waitress who seemed to be running the place herself! This place seems to have a lot of pre done, out of a box kind of food. It wasn't good at all. I am hoping they can step it up a bit as there are not that many Mexican food restaurants on this side of town. I got the impression they weren't trying to hard because of the \"sports bar\" atmosphere. I will give them some more time and try again later.... But for the love of God... Please offer some real hot sauce...not out of a bottle!"}
{"text":"We were really hoping this place would be good, but unfortunately, it was far from it. The salsa had a decent flavor, but was too chunky. We asked for some hot sauce to add to it, but all they had was Tabasco and Tapatio. The chips tasted like they were store bought, the enchilada sauce from a can, pre-fabbed taco shells, dry carne asada meat in the rocky point tacos, cheese that wasn't melted in the cheese enchiladas... Pretty rough. The only thing we liked was the beans. The owner really needs to revisit the ingredients and the way they're prepared if they want this place to be more than just a bar that has off track betting. Our server was really nice, but she had way too many tables... Again, the manager or owner needs to pay more attention and staff appropriately. I really hope they can figure this stuff out, as it would be really nice to have another option over on this side of town."}
{"text":"An amazing place great service and holy tv's batman!!!! Food was excellent. Service even better, the owners put together one heck of a fun place. Off track betting is a plus!!! The Mexican pizza is excellent, draft beer ice cold."}
{"text":"Went here to watch some football with friends, i thought the service was good, had a number of beers and chips with quacamole dip. All good from my opinion, nice little place with a ton of tvs. If you are looking for fancy or are a picky person you won't like it."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke! We stopped in here about a year ago when it was Arizona pizza company and were sadly disappointed then with the lack of service as well as food quality.  We chalked it up to trying a new place and never returned until we saw signs saying new ownership and a new name.  Today we stopped in and should have turned and walked right back out.  The place looked exactly the same inside which told me we were probably in for similar experience. We found a spot to sit and it was surprisingly busy (football) but when I saw that no one was eating I knew why later.  It took about 7 minutes to be greeted and our drink order taken.  She then returns 10 minutes later to take our food order.  We ordered a mexican pizza with ground beef and nachos with chicken  that took 30 minutes to prepare.  When the food finally arrived I was shocked at what I saw, my young child could have prepared a better lunch.  They were both priced at 7.99 the \"Mexican pizza' was nothing more than a burrito sized tortilla out of the package with cheese and maybe a 1/2 cup of ground beef.  The nachos had hardly any cheese and the chicken was cold and dry but the chips were burnt.  Not sure how that happens.  This place is a joke and needs to be visited by bar rescue and John taffer.  I suggest you find another place to eat or drink it's not worth the money or the time you will waste hoping it's going to be better for you. It only received 1 star because it won't allow a 0 star rating."}
{"text":"Dos Mas has to be one of the worst Mexican food restaurants we have ever been to. So where do I begin, we got the menu and there was not much of a selection. So we decided to order from the appetizer side and had the Mini Chimis, rice, beans anda quesadilla. The server brought us some chips and salsa. The chips tasted like old oil and the salsa was clumpy and watery. We got our quesadilla and Mini Chimis. The Mini Chimis had no flavor unless you call the taste of oil flavor. The beans also had no flavor and the rice was under cooked. I would like to say the only thing there that did taste good was the water but that was before the server put her finger in my cup to refill it. Can't say that we will ever make it back there.."}
{"text":"Visited this place today after a couple of months. My first experience back in July was not that good and had not tried again. Heard they have a new manager and chef; wanted to give a try again. They surprised me by making awesome Veggie Tacos even though it was not on their menu! I would come back every Tuesday to this place for dollar Taco and $2 Mexican drafts. Bar tender Stephanie was awesome and didn't mind serving food and drinks in their spacious outdoor patio, where we enjoyed the beautiful valley fall weather while munching the tacos. Glad I gave them a second chance!"}
