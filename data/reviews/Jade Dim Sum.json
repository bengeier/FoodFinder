{"text":"This place has such fresh food and the price is so reasonable. My spot to go for dimsum and traditional cantonese dishes any day.  5 star for food quality and quantity, service, and hot mustard"}
{"text":"I don't think I am going there again.
Beef dim sum can be left alone for sure.
Very average experience overall"}
{"text":"We thought to give this place a try after reading some mixed reviews.  We just had to try it out for ourselves.  

Getting into the parking lot was abit tricky due to constructions in the area.  We did manage to find a spot to park our car but we were there for dim sum at 5:30pm.    

The prices are incredible.  From the items that we picked, our favorites were the ha gow and sui mai's.  Our least favorites were the black bean spare ribs and the bbq pork buns.

The decor was ok, but it's not a place that you would take a date if you wanted to impress him/her.  (I did ended up with a kiss at the end of the night so who knows, maybe I am wrong)  We also found some price discrepancies on their item/price board.  Service was fine and I would go back there.  

PS:  They really need to take down their Christmas decorations.  :o)

{"text":"We have been here 3 times for dinner take out. All 3 times the place was really quiet, with at most only one table occupied. The first time was good, staff was nice, food is reasonably priced, tasted ok... not great, but ok. So we went there 2 days later as we really wanted to try their crab claws, they also sell cheap(er) frozen dim sum you could then prepare it easily at home. The staff was not very friendly at all that time. There was no \"hi/hello\", no \"thank you\", didn't even acknowledge if she heard you or not when you place your order. I was ready not to go back, no matter how cheap their frozen dim sum was. But hubby wanted to give it another chance, since it was pretty close to home, so a month later we went there again for dinner take out. Same deal, that particular serving staff was all sour face. I asked if it would be cheaper to pay by cash (the first 2 times, we didn't have to pay tax with cash), she said \"no, starting today it's the same price\" 
me:\"(yeah... really...) debit?\" 
\"ergh... cash is better\". we paid cash anyway since they don't take credit card.
when the food was ready, it was exactly like the 2nd time we were there, it was an \"excuse me\", finger pointed to the food, then walked away. Did I mention that the place was empty? it wasn't like she was busy serving other customer as no other customer was there. The whole time she was just chatting away with the kitchen staff. Anyway, we'll never set a foot in this place again."}
{"text":"Reliable dim sum in an area where there tends to be a dearth of decent Chinese food options. Brisk and somewhat inattentive service - we had to flag a waiter several times for refills on tea. But this is nothing new in Chinese restaurants. Standout dishes are sponge \"million layers\" cake and glutinous rice sesame dumpling filled with savoury ground pork. Expect to wait 5-10 mins for a table during peak hours. Frozen dumplings available for purchase. If you're looking for a dim sum fix, this is a surprisingly adequate option."}
{"text":"Average dim sum but one of the better ones in Mississauga. 
The har gow and siu mai were ok. They also had a shrimp version of siu mai in which I enjoyed.  The ginger tripe was soft and flavorful. 

   I would recommend trying the chicken/fungus and dried lily flower rice.  The chicken was very juicy and the flavors mixed well with the fungus and lily flower.  You can order it off the dim sum menu for $3.99.  Just make sure to add the sauce that's left on each table, it'll taste even better!

  All and all this place was cheap and cheerful!"}
{"text":"Jade dim sum is located at the corner of Queensway and Dixie. I work close to this area and drive by it everyday. I've always been hesitant to try it out because the restaurant's parking lot is always empty and the place had an industrial look to it. 

But after months of driving by it, I finally decided to give it a shot and to check it out. Boy am I glad I did!! The dim sum here is pretty amazing!! . It's made to order and it comes out hot and fresh. Its really tasty and flavorful and the portions are huge. It's not pricey either; $1.50 - $3.00 per order. My boyfriend and I ordered around 10-12 dishes and the total bill only came out to $30. 

The service and staff here are attentive, fast and friendly. No complaints there at all. 

The decor is a bit outdated and could use an upgrade. But I definitely recommend this place. It's worth checking it out! They also sell frozen dim sum and the prices look really cheap for the amount of food that you get."}
{"text":"Cheap dim sum that I'd always fresh and fast. The siu miu and ha gow are my favorites. Salt and pepper pork chops and fried rice are great. Order ahead for quicker take out"}
{"text":"Drove by this place thought I would try, ordered dim sum to go,  the food was very good and service was quick,  I have been to other dim sum spots where the food was not good at all for more money.  Prices where reasonable,  place has clean.  I will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Typical dim sum offerings.  We tried a wide selection of their dim sum, plus the hot/sour soup and Singapore noodles.  All were good and the prices are very fair.  Not a lot of parking but much better than downtown and it's free.  Open 9-9, 7 days a week."}
{"text":"I really like this dim sum restaurant. It's not that pricey and the quality is good. I liked that they had no carts and everything was made fresh to order. Service was okay... Noting great. Dim sum was pretty good but I also like that you can order other dishes like fried rice, noodles and soups."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant after a friend recommended takeout dimsum for us it has since become a favorite of mine after work in Mississauga. it  is easy to get to and has adequate parking in the front and in the back as I was alone on this trip I had three dimsum items the fried radish cake deep fried taro and beef rice rolls.
 All was adequately portioned well and came steaming hot except it took probably a bit longer for the food to come, as each item was made on demand.

Always look around you and try to order before a huge family comes in!  
They also have Chinese food in addition to the dimsum,  and frozen dimsum you can buy to take home so you don't have to cook!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for affordable dim sum, Jade Dim Sum is the spot. There's a wide menu selection and the prices never disappoint. My favourite is the Old Fashioned Steamed Cake. The only catch is the wait time. Expect to wait 30 minutes during lunch time."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday around 11am; it wasn't really busy with about 4 tables filled. The restaurant is relatively small, and dim sum is ordered on paper (which is what most places are doing now). The service was mediocre, they did what was needed of them but didn't look very friendly. I personally thought all the dishes were okay, my friend however did not like the har gow and siu mai. We ordered 10 dimsum dishes and the total came up to be about $31 after tax. I noticed on the way out that they do sell a few of their dim sum items frozen, har gow, siu mai, etc. in portions of 25 pieces and 50 pieces. I would definitely return as I found that some of the dishes were good and pricing was definitely a plus."}
{"text":"Yum Yum... I love Dim Sum. So I haven't written a review in a minute or two, mostly due to vacation but also because I hadn't had something really super that sparked that fire review passion inside of me - until yesterday.

Feeling some early winter blues, I wanted Dum sum to fill my tummy and warm my heart in the process so I flipped open the Yelp app in search of one of the best feel-good meals I know - Dim Sum. Jade has an average rating but given that MOST dim sum places sku below 3 stars I  took their solid 3 as a good sign.

Coming from The Queensway north on Dixie it's tough to get into due to the median running along Dixie. Do yourself a favour and make your way here by travelling south on Dixie for an easy pull in and park. On that note, there isn't a tonne of parking but enough in the adjacent lots to accommodate a potential DS rush!

Walking in, it's not a flash place by any stretch of the imagination, but it's clean, organised and has lots of seating. The best part (aside from the food) here is the menus - many times when I go for DS my complaint is without a Mandarin or Canto speaking friend, I'm basically playing Russian roulette with the menu (I can't read a thing!) At Jade, they provide you with the ordering sheet and then a 2 sided laminated menu with full pictures so you know (as a token white guy) exactly what to order!

I went a little crazy with my order so I'll let my pictures speak for themselves, however, worth mentioning items were the Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai, Sesame Buns, BBQ Pork buns, and the Fried pork dumplings. The one item that was a real failure, in my opinion, was the BBQ pork cheung fun - the pastry/noodle portion was falling apart and kinda mushy and the pork inside was very dry. Aside from this one dish, everything else was pretty amazing!

For the non-Canto/Mandarin speaking patrons, I was really pleasantly surprised with the level of customers service and English speaking staff working here. In other places it's not uncommon for customer service to be lacking at these spots and for English service to be rare - neither were an issue for me at Jade!

Overall, a fantastic experience and delicious food - I can't wait to come back.

Eatcrest Out

PS - they have a deep freezer full of fresh made/frozen dim sum for you to buy and take home and reheat yourself!"}
{"text":"I would never return to this place. The food was bland, the service was not great. Found hair in my dumpling."}
{"text":"Went here with friends recently and it was great! Pictures on the menu so you know exactly what you're ordering 

Everything was fresh and tasty. My only word of caution - some items came straight out and were very HOT! Be careful not to burn your tongue. Well priced, will definitely be back again! So glad to have a good dim sum place close to home!"}
{"text":"Average dim sum restaurant. Relatively inexpensive and staff were friendly. Nothing special about the dim sum, but they were all pretty good. Parking is limited, and the restaurant is located in an industrial zone. All-in-all, would go back again for another meal, for this is one of the better dim sum restaurants in the area, as there aren't that many to begin with."}
{"text":"Great dim sum. Kinda divey looking but very clean and the food is great and so is the service."}
{"text":"For someone who works walking distance from Jade it took me a damn long time to get with the program. Parking has been a headache for the last year since they opened. Every time I decided to visit, there is a new road that happens to need construction. Parking is limited, or I'll end up waiting a ridiculous amount of time to be seated with not a care in the world from the workers. 

This past Friday, I FINALLY managed to bypass construction, traffic, and got seated in less than 2 minutes. 

Food that stood out to me: rice rolls with dried shrimp. I hate, hate, HATEEE dried shrimp, but I LOVED these rolls. I actually ordered it by accident thinking that I ordered the regular shrimp rolls and when they came out, I was so upset with myself lol. So glad I risked eating it because its all I've been thinking about since Friday. Imagine salty fish fried rice except in a rice rolls. Ya, it was damn good esp dipped in hoisen/pb sauce oh heaven. Siu Mai was nice and plump, not overcooked unlike most dimsums, they were a good size. 

Food that was meh: Dumplings were dry, dough was not soft, but more thick and rubbery. Custard buns were fresh in the sense where they were made with fresh egg yolk, but it was way too runny. 

Service was Meh, they could care less of our existence and couldn't care less that we were customers. Not the friendliest service I've received, but also not the worst.  Overall, not a bad place to go if you are looking for cheap dimsum. At $2.20 a plate you cant really complain, some dishes though are $3.25. They sell frozen buns if your into that 6 for $4 bucks."}
{"text":"My mom loves dim sum. Unfortunately for her, dim sum in Ottawa (where she lives now) is not that good compared to in Toronto (where she used to live), not to mention that dim sum in Ottawa is at least twice the price that it is in Toronto. So needless to say, on our most recent trip back to the GTA, we had to get some dim sum. We checked out Jade Dim Sum and were not disappointed! They serve some good dim sum for real cheap. We (mom, dad and I) stuffed ourselves silly for just over $30 (not including tax and tip).

All the dim sum items we ordered were $2.50-$2.99. The shrimp har gow, shrimp siu mai, shrimp spinach dumplings and shrimp rice rolls were amazing! They were fully of shrimpy goodness! The Shanghai soup dumplings were ok, but lacked flavour. The fried taro cakes were disappointing. They were mushy and tasted mostly of flour :( My dad loved the chicken feet (I didn't eat any because chicken feet freak me out). He also liked the beef tripe (I didn't eat any of this either because tripe looks like pieces of towels). I'm adventurous, but not that adventurous, haha. We also ordered some Cantonese Chow Mein ($11.50). The noodles were really crispy and they were generous with the toppings.

Service was great, which I have to admit, I was surprised by, as dim sum places are not known to have the best service. Servers were friendly and polite. I like how your order is in duplicate. They take the original and the carbon copy is kept at your table. As they bring the dishes, they mark it off on your copy. Prices are clearly marked on the order sheet too.

They do charge you $2 for a pot of tea, which wasn't indicated anywhere that I could see, but since the food items were so reasonably priced, this didn't bother me.

Everything is in English and their menu has pictures.

It's a casual eatery, so don't expect anything fancy.

Overall, an excellent place to get your dim sum fix without breaking the bank.

There's minimal parking at the front of the restaurant, so parking might be an issue during peak hours. We were there for dinner on a Friday and there were 2 parking spots left."}
{"text":"Not a bad little place for the price. The frozen, bulk dim sum they offer is great. The dim sum itself, mediocre, in my opinion, although, it really depends on what you're eating. Certain items are definitely more tasty than others. It's convenient and quick."}
{"text":"Great place for dim sum. Variety of options to pick from. They seriously need to change their tables though. Very wobbly and you never know when they gona topple over."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. Dumplings are made in house and you can really taste the difference. They also sell frozen their dim sum in the front. Servers are friendly and accommodating. My new favorite joint."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times, very reasonable price with good quality dim sum. The restuarant is bright and clean although decoration is a little bit old style. Service is also good and staffs are friendly.  The only thing that might need an improvement is probably to accept credit card as payments."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located near the intersection Dixie and Queensway. Limited parking space. Lots of traffic in the area. Very old school Chinese restaurant theme (plain and simple). Services were good and friendly. 
I got steam buns, crab claws, short ribs, dumplings, tripes, and radish cake. Tasted okay."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with Happy Jade on Dixie and Dundas (which also serves dim sum).  This used to be located at Cawthra and Dundas in a decrepit plaza and had their sole focus on selling frozen dim sum.  Their frozen dim sum was quite good and we used to buy it semi-frequently, however I always hated going there because it was kind of ghetto, both on the inside and outside.  

They've moved to Dixie and Queensway now and have cleaned it up a bit.  They have some tables (and tablecloths on top of them!) so it's a bit of a dine-in area now.  It's not fancy or anything, but it's clean.  

It's a la carte dim sum and it's not bad.  It's 2.20 for almost every single dish with the exception or rice bowls and some specialty items. The rice bowls are 3.80 and other specialty items are 2.70.  Not bad per dish.  

$2.20 is a steal for some dishes (cheung-fun/rice noodle rolls, which are always medium now and cost anywhere between $3-$3.80 depending on where you, har-gow and stuffed eggplant).  A lot of their $2.20 dishes are medium somewhere else and costs at least a $1 more per dish.  I've posted a pic of our order sheet so you can see the prices for yourself. 

Food order: har gow, siu main, BBQ pork bun, chicken feet with black bean sauce, bean curd roll with pork, shrimp cheung fun.  Everything was decent, but I'd recommend the siu mai (which are huge and meaty) and the BBQ pork bun.  While the pork bun had okay meat in it, the flavouring was delicious.  3/5

Service:  It's an Asian restaurant and they realized we were customers.  That would get them a 5/5 for an Asian restaurant, but in reality, 2.5/5.  We got food quickly.  

Price: 4/5 - like I said above - cheap. 

It seems like a good place for a small family lunch.   

Tip: Try coming from the north or else you're going to have a make U-turn if you come from the south."}
{"text":"I've been to another Jade Dim
Sum in Winsor, and that one was much better, both food quality and service.  The food at this place is below average,and in the end they don't accept credit card even our bill was above 20 bucks. I mean, which restaurant does not accept credit card these days ?? I cannot think of another reason other than the fact that they are trying to EVADE TAXES... Plus the female owner was very rude when we paid USD cash without leaving a good tip. Based on exchange rate we're leaving almost 25% tip... I'll never go to this place again."}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum restaurant but hard to spot due to its location. The food is reasonably priced and tasty. The amount of seating and look of the place could be better but if you're looking for some really good Chinese food, this is the place to check out."}
{"text":"Although Jade Dim Sum looks a bit lacklustre, the food and service definitely makes up for their otherwise unassuming appearance. The prices were not too bad either - for a party of five, the total came down to just $60 - not a bad deal! Service was very fast - we had our first dish ten minutes after placing our order. I particularly enjoyed the potstickers, bean curd rolls and fried taro puffs. If you are feeling for some dim sum but are under a time crunch, Jade is definitely a great option to consider!"}
{"text":"I was not a big fan of dim sum until I came across this cute little place. One of my favourite cheap-eats go to! There's nothing more to say, I love this place. Doesn't break bank, good food, and quick service! 

Would recommend to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Agree with other reviewers that this is no frills and as far as cleanliness it's standard (dishes mostly clean but sometimes you have to check). Lots of family on a Sunday morning so a good sign. Yes there are also a lot non Asian customers but honestly Canadian pallets are nowadays more advanced that most people could pick out good chinese food from the bad ones. There are no guarantees these days just because one does not mind driving all the way to the east end, so perfectly happy to have something decent closed to home and not burn a tank of gas and deal with parking lot nightmare in Scarborough. 

Like that all the standard dim sum dishes are available at good prices (2.20 for must dishes). Sunday morning the place is filled up by 11.

Love the black sesame bun. But order them half way through your meal so they are still warm when you get to eat them. 

There's something homey about this place - not sure how to describe it. 

Took a chance trying this place and glad we did."}
{"text":"Cheap and pretty cheerful. Tasty and hot dim sum with no carts which I think is a good thing."}
{"text":"My wife and I come to Toronto from NYC 3-4 times a year and have dim sum a couple of times each visit. I brag to my friends that Toronto has better Chinese food than the city.
Well this place doesn't live up to the standards of what we've experienced on previous trips. The only good thing about the food was it was hot. The stuffed eggplant had very little stuffing, fried dumplings had a thick doughy skin. The other dishes weren't memorable.
The service was terrible. We were greeted by a friendly waiter who took our order. Four out of the seven dishes came out at a good pace and the stopped. We asked the friendly waiter who said just a few minutes. Ten minutes later another waiter came over to hurry us out the restaurant. We told them we were still missing three dishes she actually investigated the problem. Ten minutes later the first of the missing three came and ten minutes after that the final dish appeared. 
Was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Probably the best dim sum in Mississauga. Too bad the location sucks: limited parking, always construction and kind of far from a lot of things. I think on the weekends they expand their parking to the back but ask to make sure.

Both a mixture of cheap and good. Yes they have a limited amount of variety but they know how to do it right. I love eating their deep fried pork-dumplings, they're full of stuffing, always crispy and always steaming hot. Although one time I had them and they weren't cooked all the way but it never happened again. It also was not too heavy greasy as it is deep fried. I also love getting their Liu Sa Bao, which I saw someone mistaken for custard buns..they are NOT custard buns, they are 10000x better. It's essentially a salted egg + custard, hence the flowy-ness of the insides. It's supposed to be like that. It is heaven.

Honestly the food is what's keeping me coming back and I don't even really like dimsum. Service is fast and efficient just like a Chinese restaurant should be, and no the servers aren't rude, that's just how they are. Don't be expecting them to ask you how your meal is. They're there to get the job done and efficiently. They also do wholesale for other restaurants and grocery stores, so that's probably why you think you've had it before somewhere else and you thought it tasted better. It's probably the same.

Wish they had more variety and a better location but it'll have to do so far!"}
{"text":"The service is impeccable, attentive, friendly. The food is spectacular. Honestly, the best dim sum place in the GTA. Huge dumplings, amazing plates with lots of flavour. And the bill came to less than 50$ for 4 people! I definitely recommend making the trip over here.

I am also going to provide the same tip mentioned below: if driving here it is better to come from the North than the South. If you come from the South you will have to make a U-Turn or drive around a bit."}
{"text":"In the middle of nowhere in an industrial area. It's a roomy establishment big enough to cater the brunch rush versus Happy Dim sum. There is little to no wait time for getting a table.

They do not have cart service for dim sum but instead ordering off a sheet of paper, they also have pictures to compare what is what. They also have other dishes besides just dim sum traditional dishes. And the prices for the dim sum are around 2.80, fairly inexpensive.

The food was decent and came out fast and hot.

The staff are super friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I loved both times! The dumplings are delicious, the service is fast, and the prices cannot be beat. I absolutely love this place and cannot wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Great stop on the way to the airport. Yes! You don't need to go to one of the many chinatowns to get dim sum. It's not overwhelming with salt or msg. 

Beef balls: interesting meat balls, it was like the middle of a dim sum without the wrapper. Not too much filler or vegetation to be wrangling with. For the most part tasty. :) 

Pork and vegetable dumplings: yummy again, not too much filler, and mostly meat.  Tender and not chewy. I'd order it again. 

Salt and pepper short ribs: very interesting my friends... these were not your average short ribs yet delicious. Plain salt and pepper... perhaps I'll order the sweet and sour or another type. 

Shrimp fun: yum... especially with all the shrimp enveloped inside the delicate noodle. 

Note: this is not a large place.. although their tables can seat up to 8  and there are a few of them. Just so you know this isn't a large Cantonese style restaurant. It's a good local mom and pops place with great food! 

So if you are on the way to the airport in Mississauga, it's about an 10 drive. Definite stop. They have quick service and easy parking in the lot. More parking out back."}
{"text":"I'd rather drive an hour to Scarborough for dim sum. 

The food is VERY mediocre, some were great and others tasted awful. Overall the food was soooooo average (I could go to T&T and buy dim sum that tastes better), and there is nothing too special about this place and if you are a person who prides themselves on good dim sum then tread with caution. 

The thing that really did it for me was the lack of cleanliness. Both my husband and I got chopsticks caked with black smears at the tip, and when we got a different pair that was just as dirty."}
{"text":"Prices are good. Just don't order the squid. Service was good. On weekends, there are lots of parking spaces."}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST! 

Ok, so I love Dim Sum, and my Dad & I are the only ones in our family who like to eat it. So when my uncle comes in from out of town, and wants to eat Dim Sum with us, I'm definitely ALWAYS down. 

We came here on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30pm on Fathers Day 2018 and it was packkkked. But we didn't mind waiting. Thankfully we were seated right away since there were only 3 of us. 

It's not a super fancy place, but it's clean, organised and has lots of seating. 

There is also no cart service here, but table service, so it kind of feels like an ACYE restaurant. The staff are also so friendly and helpful! 
There are also a lot of English speaking staff working here. So if you don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin, fear not, you can definitely find someone here to help you. 

They start you off with the classic jasmine tea (this is so great for digestion and your metabolism ) It's also included and you can definitely ask for free refills throughout your meal. 

Something really great about this place are it's menus, they have the standard itemized list menu with the English translations as well as a photo menu with the corresponding numbers so you can actually see what you're planning on ordering. 

Standouts: 

Shrimp Dumpling (Ha Gow)
Pork Shrimp Sui Mai 
Shrimp Cheung Fun ( Rice Flour Roll ) 
Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf
Fried Shrimp Roll 
Deep Fried Crab Claw

Overall, I had an amazing first experience here, and I will definitely come back!

PS - They also have a deep freezer full of fresh made/frozen dim sum  for purchase so you can take it home and reheat yourself!"}
{"text":"I believe this restaurant has a great value, but ultimately it's a mostly average dim sum restaurant.  We got seven items, and found five of the seven to be very fresh tasting and made well.  However, two of the items were not as good as we expected them to be.  

The first item not up to standard was the doughnut wrapped in rice rolls.  The doughnut was stale, and when I informed a server, she stated that they deep fry the doughnut a second time before wrapping in the rice wrapper so that it doesn't get too soft.  As a Kitchen Manager who's cooked for over 10 years professionally, I can tell you that twice deep frying batter makes the product even crispier, and usually heavily soaked in oil.  The doughnut that she claimed they twice fried was dry and hard.  If I had to guess, it was at least hours old, but since they only opened the doors 2 hours previously, I then deduced that it was probably from the previous day.  Regardless, the explanation didn't satisfy me, and the dish didn't either.  We didn't eat anymore of that dish.

The second item was the steamed black sesame buns.  The bun appeared to be freshly steamed, but after the first bite, it tasted a bit dry and crumbly.  Same explanation from before.  When bread sits out for a few hours, it tends to get dry and crumbly.  I would bet that this item was prepped the day before and left out for too long.  Either that, or it was steamed and not served previously, and then steamed again for us.  Unlike the previous dish, this was still tasty enough to finish.

All the other items we ordered were good (Har Gow, Shrimp Wontons, Squid Tenticles, Preserved Sausage on Rice, Deep Fried Eggplant).  It appears that they have some sort of a Dim Sum factory in the back (perhaps it was a factory before adding the store front?), so the quality and freshness are there.  It's just unfortunate that the emphasis on food waste is so great that they possibly re-heat food a second time instead.

Overall, the food is average to good, but the prices are excellent.  The prices ranged from $2.29-$3.  Very competitive to downtown Chinatown and uptown Markham/Richmond Hill prices."}
{"text":"The prices is cheap but can't say the food is great.  There was pieces of water chestnut in my hai gows which is a no no.  The rice roll was too thick and not very slippery."}
{"text":"This was my favorite and go-to dimsum place in Sauga. We'd go here like once a week. But the last two times had terrible service. One time, when we re-ordered, she wrote down the wrong order and literally argues with us when we said we didn't want it and it was HER mistake! Absolutely disrespectful! Then the next time we came in, we re-ordered a second order of dumplings. The waitress was sent to our table 3 times with the wrong order and was annoyed and apologetic because it wasn't really her fault. We waited about 45-55 minutes and the dumplings never came so we cancelled them. I did the math ahead of time (because I think they overcharged us last time we had to cancel an order) and what do you know...they STILL charged us for our cancelled order which we mentioned 3 times and they confirmed we were not charged for. 
You wanna lose your best customer? Well this is how."}
{"text":"Alright here's the place where you get take out food on dim sum and it won't hurt your wallet.   Definitely come by here for my dim sum fix.  Always order the shrimp deep fried rolls awesome l!!!! Haven't dine in because I love close to this place.   But if you do order take call in advance and save yourself the trouble of waiting 20mins there.  If you need that dim sum fix that won't hurt the wallet swing by here.  You can also purchase premade dim sum to cook at home as well"}
{"text":"As far as dim sum goes, this place isn't rewriting the book. The dim sum is fairly mediocre, the skins are thick and floury, they use aluminum trays for the shanghai dumplings, and the décor is dated. With all that said, this place presents a certain charm. The food is plentiful, very tasty and extremely well-priced. It is also the best dim sum option in the area. Best Friend Restaurant is a few intersections west, but is a little more average. Not a bad option for lunch if you're in the area and craving some dim sum. I really enjoyed their friend pork dumplings, bbq pork rice noodle roll and shiu mai. They make a pretty great chili oil. They also sell frozen dim sum to make at home, interesting cross between a wholesaler and a restaurant."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  Odd location with minimal parking.

The Shrimp sui mai was great!  Also chicken available.  
Rice rolls with you choice of beef, pork, shrimp etc was alright... wish they were served with the sweetened soy sauce rather than the generic soy sauce thats on the table.

Went with parents (both chinese) and husband (1/2 portugese/chinese).  Reviews were mixed about this place.  My parent and husband said the rolls, dumpings, curry cuttlefish, fried tenticles were good.  However thier fried dishes lacked and were too oily... Shrimp wonton (husband said the wrap they used was not good), Deep fried shrimp w/ crab claw (husband said this was very good),  No one liked the beef ho fun... meat was chewy and flavorless.

They do sell a large variety of frozen dumplings that you can enjoy at home.  Yhe prices are very fair.

Note:  They only accept cash or debit."}
{"text":"I rarely eat dim-sum due to bad experience with food poisoning at Emerald Dragon. So I gave it a chance coming here not knowing what to expect.

The food came out quickly and everything I tried tastes decent. Only downside to the whole experience is the lack of parking spaces. 

Not much into the décor as I am there to eat, but they did have multiple infractions from the public health unit. Nothing too big. You can find it here and any of the restaurants you visit will have an audit.

{"text":"Not too shabby! Have seen this place driving by on occasion as it's close to my work. The menu prices listed on here aren't up-to-date! I forgot to grab a menu for my quick takeout order! Wasn't feeling too well, nothing a bowl of Congee won't fix.  Pretty decent! Ordered the Congee with pork and preserved eggs and rice noodle wrapped with fried dough, $2.85 each! The Congee was a tiny bit smaller than what I'm usually used to but for he price it's pretty decent! Looking forward to getting more takeouts in the future whenever I'm craving something outside of Sherway food court food!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been going through a dim sum kick and lately we have found ourselves eating it every weekend. Today we happened to be in the Dixie and Dundas area so we paid a visit to Jade Dim Sum. We have been here before, but did not really take notice of the food.
Now that my boyfriend is dim sum obsessed, a running commentary comparing food is served up along with steamed goods.

That being said, the food at Jade Dim Sum is pretty good. You don't get the amount of selection you would from the cart style dim sum, but what they do have is pretty good and you don't miss out on anything. Most of the items we ordered were steaming hot and incredibly fresh, which is an experience you can't always get elsewhere. The only exceptions were the sausage rice and the fried squid. Both were, in my opinion, stale and cold. 

Notable yummies: BBQ pork triangles, har gow, siu mai and peppercorn beef and steamed pork buns.

We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"This is a no-frills dim sum joint with hot and tasty dishes at a really affordable price.  Can't ask for much more than that.

We stumbled upon it on a Saturday morning while picking up some motorcycle engine oil at Rider's Choice, next door.

At 11am, we got our choice of almost any table.  Service was friendly and our dim sum picks came rather quickly.

Most dishes were standard fare but I really loved the steamed black sesame buns.  Tiny egg tarts were also hot and flaky.  Steamed dumplings were meaty and fresh tasting.

I want to assume that because Jade runs a wholesale business as well, maybe they supply to other Chinese restaurants around the GTA.

Ten dim sum dishes with tea, taxes and tip for $32 and we didn't have to battle the lines on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"I finally found a dim sum place where I can stuff my face without the guilt of spending all my money! 
I noticed this restaurant as I was driving to Etobicoke from Mississauga, and the name 'Dim Sum' immediately got me googling for its menu. Once I realized how affordable it is compared to the other dim sum restaurants that I've tried, it was a must-go.
We went Saturday night, and surprisingly it was pretty empty, with only one table occupied.
The menu had many options, along with a separate menu containing non-dim sum items. I immediately noticed that they lacked vegetarian options, where I think they had around 5 vegetarian dishes max.
The decor of the restaurant was lacking any effort.
Every table had the menus already placed, along with a separate sheet which you are required to mark to let them know which and how many dim sums you want.
Service was good and we were immediately served tea without even asking. each serving of dim sum, which consists of 3 to 4 pieces, cost somewhere between $2 to $4, which is an amazing price.
The food took the right amount of time to be served (not too short, indicating food that isn't fresh, or not too long). All the dishes were steaming hot and really satisfying. However, I did unintentionally order only shrimp options, while my buddy tried a variety. So from my experience, even though my 5 dishes contained shrimp, they all seemed to taste the same, despite them having different ingredients. 
I know the concept of these restaurants is to share each plate with everyone on the table, but I had preferences that were different from my friends, which is why we ordered separately. So, I cant speak for him, but he seemed to enjoy his choices, especially this glutinous rice roll stuffed with chicken. 
By the end we were extremely stuffed and the bill was yet reasonable. 
One thing to note is that they charge you for the tea, even though you don't order it.
After confronting this to the server, he went to another lady and they said something in their language, after which they started to laugh. I assume they get this issue often. Later on the server came back and explained to us that it is customary for all dim sum restaurants to serve tea and that you're not only paying for the tea, but also everything you used, such as the table, chop sticks, plates, etc. A different concept, but I just went with it, since it was only 60cents extra.
So overall, I enjoyed this restaurant and will definitely return when I get the cravings. Maybe next time order something other than shrimp.
If you want the best dim sum in the GTA, I would recommend Mothers Dumplings in Toronto, but get ready to pay a hell a lot more. But if you want something affordable then Jade Dim Sum is a good choice."}
{"text":"It was a nice dim sum restaurant. The food was average and it could have been more seasoned overall. I really appreciate the service being attentive. The system of getting the dim sum was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"I drove by here for years but never had a chance to try this place until my brother suggested it and glad we tried.
It has Good space, great fast service, and overall good foods at a cheap price.  I love the chicken feet!"}
{"text":"Really they put us close to door and they food coming so late ....now they asking for tips ?? Is the tips now be coming must ? ! Since when ??
I guess now they have lots tips from all customers, is that they reported to taxes ?"}
{"text":"3.5* 
Good food and imo and friend's would say the price is really good here. Ranges from $2.8-2.99 for majority of Dim Sum dishes and $4.5 for Rice. I haven't had DS in sooo long so I went a little overboard and ordered 19 dishes for 3 people :) LOL (packed leftovers for lunch the next day). 

I came on a wednesday afternoon for lunch around 1pm and it wasn't busy. I just don't really like the location as much as it's at a busy intersection and there's only one way getting in and out of this plaza. A bit far for me to come here just to eat ds as there are other ones more central Sauga but I was near by and my mom hasn't been here before so took her here. 

Quite a bit of seats and a few large round tables. Not the greatest interior but food was made in house and comes out piping hot and fresh. However it does take a while for the steamed stuff to come out. 
We ordered a lot and got all of the items on our list with no problems. 

They accept cash and DEBIT only. I paid with debit and near the cash there's a freezer where you can buy their frozen ds in bulk. My mom bought a few bags of ha-gao and siu-mai for us and her sister for $25 a bag and I think there's 50 pieces in 1 bag?

3.5* for food. Decent dim sum!
3* for service. Only had one negative experience with one lady. Sounded a bit rude to my mom when she asked her a question. The rest I had no problems with."}
{"text":"What happened to taste and flavours?! Practically all the dimsum dishes were so bland.  For the first time the sirracha bottle was being used by every member of my family, which was comical but what's a person to do when food tastes like nothing.
The bill came to $136 including tips for 38 dishes of dimsum.  So that's  $27 per person.
I can get a good meal else where for what i paid."}
{"text":"Most of the things I said in my original review still stands. Go read that first! 

Still great food now. However, portion sizes have drastically reduced for some of the dishes... I guess something had to suffer, in order for them to keep their prices... sigh..."}
{"text":"First off, I wanted to order everything on the menu! The price is super good and ranges around $2.5-$4.5. 
They don't have any special items, but basically all the main dim sum items to fill your crave. You can also 
buy their dim sum frozen so you can enjoy at the comfort of your own home. 

The restaurant looks a bit run down, but the service is nice. Servers speak English well enough to communicate with you! The food was mediocre compared to dim sum places in Markham, but it was edible - some items were a bit cold though. 

I'm not sure if I'll be back since the location is kind of far from me, but definitely if I'm craving it and around the area."}
{"text":"Most random spot to open a dim sum restaurant. There's a lot of traffic congestion here due to construction so it can be a pain to get in and out of this restaurant. 

If you're looking for a nice dim sum experience this is not the place to go. This is just the place to get some good and cheap dim sum. The staff don't really talk to you so they're just there to give you your orders and give you the bill. 

Dim sum is pretty cheap here where each order is about $2.60. There are no carts being pushed around so you just order what you want on a sheet and the staff rings it in. They have a sheet with pictures on it to help you figure out what you're ordering. Their dim sum tastes pretty good! My favourites are the siu mai, shrimp rice roll, and the curry squid."}
{"text":"Ok so yes the service isn't amazing and the decor is outdated but the dim sum was cheap and tasty. The only thing that bothered me was that they charged for the tea."}
