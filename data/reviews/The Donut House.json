{"text":"I'm sure people will strongly disagree with me. There was nothing special about these donuts. I was kind of disappointed after all the hype about them. I think Duck Donuts is much much better!  I will say they were fresh tasting. I'm not feeling the need to go back and give them another opportunity."}
{"text":"Great doughnuts. But my favorite is the apple fritter. Everything is always awesome though."}
{"text":"This place makes delicious donuts! We went when it was down time around 1030. My family really enjoyed the glazed donuts.  I was a little disappointed in the coffee."}
{"text":"It's always been DD for me, but I tried The Donut Shop donuts and couldn't believe how good they are! I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Usually we hit Your Mom's Donuts in Matthews when the craving hits.  When I saw this place had opened, I was giddy with delight.  Because donuts that's why.    The storefront is pretty no frills.  Self serve coffee bar, assorted cold drinks in the fridge.  Staff is very friendly and ready to answer questions.  The donuts  are very tasty.  Not quite the gut bomb that Your Mom's Donuts are.  I can even eat more than one in a sitting .  Prices are a little better than YMDs also.    Don't get me wrong, YMDs are great and I'll still be hitting them up here and there.  But with The Donut House being closer, the value they bring, and some pretty tasty donuts, I'll be here more often!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Saw Yelp notification that this place opened recently. Some reviewers said they run out of certain kinds of donuts, so we went as early as possible. Followed my GPS & didn't see Donut House. My son & I were both looking, driving around the neighborhood, in case the GPS was slightly off. Nope. Went back to the original strip mall to look again. Yep, there it was at the very end, next to State Farm. The SIGN WASN'T ON!!! All the other business, even though they weren't open yet had their signs lit! So, if you're looking, it's in the strip mall behind Chik fil A.  Now, the donuts were absolutely worth the extra effort! They had a good selection of fresh donuts so we bought a dozen to try several varieties. They will fill long johns and round donuts while you wait, with one of several choices of filling. They put a nice amount in there compared to the local donut chains. We liked the chocolate filling the best. The cinnamon twists were also great. All of the varieties they had were made from raised dough, better than KK because they had more substance. IF they also made Old Fashioned Cake Donuts, they would be perfect! The staff was friendly & helpful. I now crave these donuts!"}
{"text":"Just had a pine cone donut from this cute little shop, and it was delicious!!! Will certainly be coming back here often. Reminds me of donuts from western NY! Awesome!! Best little hidden gem in Indian Trail!"}
{"text":"Thanks to my mom for introducing me......I now love this place, maybe more than Krispy Kreme  It's my new obsession!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Friday and got a dozen donuts for my staff and they absolutely loved them!!! We will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting donuts, puts others to shame as far as I'm concerned. Made fresh daily in store."}
{"text":"Uptown flavors and Indian Trail prices. Big. Fluffy. About a buck for a regular glazed and a few cents more for flavored glazes or filled donuts (they fill them as they are ordered). All of the glazes and chocolate flavors were spot on. Fantastic local donut spot. Can see them making the donuts in the back room. What would you go to Dunkin or Krispy when this is an option? You shouldn't. Delicious."}
{"text":"SLOW!!! Excruciatingly slow. There are four people working but the service: register, boxing, filling donuts is all handled by one person. I am the fourth person in line, and I've been in line for at least 15 minutes. For food that's already made and sitting, this is absolutely ridiculous.   Unless this donut tastes like absolute joy, we won't be back."}
{"text":"These are the closest California style donuts you can get in the area. Fantastic! Wish they had more selections of buttermilk/old fashioned style. Much better than the chain stores. They frequently sell out of the chocolate raised/glazed."}
{"text":"I'll take one of each please! Everything was amazing and I can't believe how reasonably priced they were. Back home, a donut with those crazy toppings would be $3-$5 so with these prices, it's easy to indulge. There wasn't much line when we arrived, but we must have had perfect timing because it was out the door when we left! My only complaint is the maple bacon wasn't as good as others I've had elsewhere. The bacon was too chewy/soft and not salty enough to add the contract with the maple frosting, but it was still good. I mean, it's not like we didn't eat it. :-)"}
{"text":"Great donuts, tried cream filled, chocolate with chocolate cream and plain glazed, one is a meal for me."}
{"text":"AWESOME!  First time here and will definitely be back again.  Some of the best donuts I have had. They melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Today was my third wonderful donut experience and it was completely yummy..... keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"Their donuts were absolutely amazing I have had some of the best donuts in every state that I visited and I travel very often and I have to say that this might be one of my favorite places now"}
{"text":"Very very good donuts. Favorite part? Choosing the filling. Oh yeah. Only downsize: they close at 2 or whenever they run out of donuts."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best donut places I've eaten at in the area. everything was fresh and the service was great. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Some of the BEST donuts I've had! Great prices and lots of options. Get there early because they sell out fast on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I paid $1.33 for one donut...it tastes sooooo fresh and good!!! Defiantly will come back and I definitely will recommended this place to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"These donuts are the BOMB.COM!!!!!!! I read the reviews before coming in and the pictures were on point. I have been searching far and wide for the Chinese made donuts in Los Angeles and THESE ARE IT!!!!!! yeast donut with vanilla frosting and sprinkles. period! The owners know what they are doing! It would be nice to see the girls at the front counter smile! I think because the store was new, they were so focused on doing everything right, but customer service starts with demeanor. Other than that, I will be coming back today and many more times in the future."}
{"text":"Great service awesome doughnuts. Great variety. And for such specialty doughnuts the price is about the same."}
{"text":"I always like trying new mom and pop donut shops but the scowl on the young lady working the afternoon that we tried this little shop on our first visit left us somewhat unmotivated to return. The donuts themselves were decent - we tried a choc covered, a cinnamon twist and an apple fritter. The place is small consisting of only 2 booths but is pleasant and clean.Since our teenage girls go to the nearby Christian School, we will surely be back one morning, but won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"This is a small establishment but it's got huge flavor and value in their donuts!  Their donuts are huge and they're soo fluffy, omg!  Gotta get there early or else your selections are pretty slim because they sell out quickly.  The donut holes are great and the apple fritter is bomb."}
{"text":"Very very good donuts! Light and fluffy and not greasy. You can get glazed donuts and choose your filling and they will be filled fresh on the spot. And mad do you get a lot of filling! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! It was love at first bite. These donuts are so fluffy, soft, and irresistible. I have never know such a incredible donut before!  Prices are affordable, the staff are friendly, and the place is clean. This is definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"I love Krispy Kreme donuts, however this place might just be the substitute I need! I am not a sprinkles, cake donut type of gal I just like glazed.  The customer service is pretty consistent but there was a time when I asked for fresh donut out the grease but the young lady tried to tell me they were all from the same batch when I literally saw them take them out the grease and frost them. Needless to say I opted for the donut holes which were warm because they just came out! Overall it was delicious and I will go back!"}
{"text":"For our office meeting our manger bought in some delicious treats for us and my GOODNESS!!! It was delish!!!!! Like I ate a piece of heaven. This is a must place to visit!! They have chocolate covered with custard fill and it was huge!!! There version of a dozen donuts are 10 times bigger then your standard. The prices and amazing!"}
{"text":"I know, I know... I am the only person in Indian Trail, perhaps all of North Carolina, maybe even the world that isn't in love with the donut house.  First off the shop is brand new and perhaps they haven't had a chance to work out the kinks, but I found the donut to be slightly under cooked, as if they were rushed to be put out.  Plus, the staff seems very tired and overwhelmed (for good reason!).  Lots of wait time and small tables are in high demand at the shop.  The glaze is very, very sweet.  Like make your teeth hurt sweet.  The donuts are not greasy which is a plus.  And they \"melt in your mouth\" but I like a bit of texture to a donut.  Not just a mouthful of sugary goo.  If they would cook them an additional 30 seconds perhaps the donut holes would have had just a tad bit of texture, something to chew.  Overall I think this business is trying to find their groove with a huge supply and demand problem.  It seems this local business has the entire area coming to enjoy the donuts.  And I wish them continued success and support from Indian Trail!  But it feels slightly like the Emperor's new clothes, everyone is afraid to admit that the donuts are just ok, for fear of backlash from peers."}
{"text":"I took my kids here one late morning to try The Donut House for the first time. The kids picked out the ones they wanted, then proceeded to devour them! :) These donuts are big and fluffy, and have a great taste to them.  So happy we have a donut shop close by with good donuts!  The interior is nice, small amount of seating but that didn't seem like an issue at all and I actually liked how it was more quaint, like a cute donut shop feel."}
{"text":"Love this place. Amazing donuts. Massive inexpensive donut holes. Our house has become addicted to the donut house."}
{"text":"These donuts were VERY fresh! I love when I go somewhere and the baked goods are fresh. My donut was even hot because I guess it was one of the newer baked ones. They're a mix of KrispyKreme melt in your mouth and dunkin thick cakes donuts. They're the perfect combination and I will 100% be back whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"If you're a Krispy Kreme lover, get ready to forget about them for good. This place has donuts that you dream of. Their donuts are baked in house and are freshly made. If you love donuts with cream filling you'll love that you get to choose whatever you like to fill your donut with! Don't miss out, this place is worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Best donuts I've ever had, when visiting the area from New York it's my first stop!!! By far the Best donut I've ever had."}
{"text":"Greta place to go to and it's a hidden gem. I came in on a Monday afternoon. They are on a strip shopping center behind the chick-Fil-A. There was a short wait. The staff was friendly and attentive where she made great recommendations. I wish we were able to sample of the great treats, but I would say the ones I tried were amazing. I had the cinnamon roll which was delicious then a taste of the red velvet and It melted in my mouth. It was a great portion. The place was clean. They noted they run out of pine cones daily there most popular flavor. I hope I get there earlier to try that one. I will definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious donut. They have big and fluffy donuts. You can choose your own fillings in your round donuts. They are not stingy putting out fresh donuts. The donut place is behind Chick fil a. The donuts are not overly sweet. I will definitely be back plus it is not overly price."}
{"text":"Awesome and delicious!  Ordered donuts for my daughter's school. The donuts were still warm when I picked them up. The children (as well as the teachers and myself) LOVED them. Seriously the best donut I've had in a long time. The customer service was outstanding, friendly, courteous and helpful. They will have my business exclusively!  Better than any of the franchise/chains in the area!"}
{"text":"Donuts are very good freshly made.  The employees are nice enough not very personable but good donuts"}
{"text":"The best donuts in the area.  The only thing I don't like is that when you get a dozen donuts they place the donuts on their side and the donuts frosting rubs against the other donuts. With a child that has certain allergies,  that is concerning to a parent. Please change boxes so donuts lay flat. He loves the donuts there. But I always worry about his allergy."}
{"text":"The donuts here are absolutely delicious and enormous!! So good...they fill them while you wait so they're extra fresh. Pricey but worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wow - excellent donuts! Glazed are superb. Chocolate glazed, mmmmmmm. Be careful, if you have one on the way home, you risk finishing the rest of the box before you get home and then what are you going to tell the rest of the family?"}
{"text":"With a name like the Donut House, you'd expect to see a cute little cottage, with a gingerbread theme or something (of course you would also expect to be on the lookout for a witch as well), but no luck. It's just another store in a strip mall that used to be a Vietnamese place. Actually they used to have some reasonable pho. But I digress.  The selection of donuts here is fairly solid, provided you get here early enough - in fact, their greatest selection is on the filled kind, mostly because you can get them filled as you watch. Well, sorta. The filling machines (and they have a wide variety) are towards the back, where the kitchen for making the pho used to be, so you can't exactly see the process, but you get an idea of what is happening.  It is nice to know that the donuts may have been sitting out for a bit but the filling is freshly done when you order.   As to the others it is somewhat hit or miss. The apple fritters are good, and generally the others can be okay, but watch out for the berries - those strawberry cake donuts are very off, and do not taste at all like there is anything fresh in them. That's not a bad thing, necessarily, but it all depends on what you are after.  The prices aren't horrible, and you are eating donuts after all - but they aren't exactly organic if that's what you're wanting to find, but you're not spending a bundle on them, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Fresh, light and fluffy donuts.  The best donuts in town!  Stopped in around 1:30 and there was no wait.  Donuts are made daily so you are always getting fresh donuts.  Great treat once in a while!"}
{"text":"We LOVE The Donut House.  Everything so tasty, literally the best tradition donuts!  And donut holes too!!  Best Apple Fritter around!"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts!  So happy they opened up in Indian trail.  You will not be disappointed with whatever choice you make.  They make California style donuts.  Apple fritters are off the chain."}
{"text":"The donut house is the only non chain shop in town but does not come close to other donut places in the area.  There flavors are very basic and don't specialize in anything."}
{"text":"The donuts are good my issue is with staff ,Tip for the owner: if you want your business to thrive hire a friendly welcoming person in their late 20's who will remember names of returning customers and be welcoming and nice to new ones not a bunch of teenage sheep that throw looks at each other wait who will get the customer while looking up and down at them not a very Pleasant experience"}
{"text":"Best donuts in the area bar none!  They are always so fresh and the filling options available make this place even better. Great product, fair price!"}
{"text":"I will only eat donuts from the Donut House my beautiful wife surprised me with 2 long John donuts.  Be sure to get your fix on Saturday they are closed on Sunday which I respect them for."}
{"text":"I had the coffee roll or whatever they call it.  It was ok, but the selection is really lacking.  Everything is just heavily glazed donuts in a few different shapes."}
{"text":"I went here based on amazing reviews from \"What's up in Indian Trail\" Facebook page.  Yes it was exactly that, amazing.  They have a huge selection from twists, apple fritters, long johns, donut holes, chocolate, etc.  The line went pretty fast as there were 3 people taking orders.  I do think that they were close to running out though and this was at 9am.  However, whatever you get you will be pleased.  Of course not the healthiest but a nice treat of deliciousness."}
{"text":"These donuts are amazing! Fluffy and light yeast donuts that are the perfect level of sweet. If you ever get a chance to try the lemon iced, then you can thank me later."}
{"text":"With the way I've been hearing people talk about this place, I expected it to be better.  The apple fritter was so greasy... like, when you squeezed it, (lightly) it dripped!!! It made it a mushy mess. The pinecones were fairly decent though.  We may give it another shot, but just not impressed this time. :("}
